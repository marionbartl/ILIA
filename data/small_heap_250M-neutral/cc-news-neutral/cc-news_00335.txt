RAWALPINDI: As many as two soldiers were killed and three others were injured in an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion near Datakhel area of North Waziristan, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday.
According to military's media wing, the blast took place when an IED planted on track by militants went off near a security forces vehicle.
The deceased were identified as Lance Naik Momin Ali and Sepoy Saleem. The injured have been shifted to Combined Medical Hospital (CMH) Peshawar.
Militancy appears to have reared its head in North Waziristan again after two girls' schools were blown up in its Miramshah Tehsil.
Later, three people were killed in a gun and knife attack which led the locals to call a sit-in until their demands to curb lawlessness and targeted killings were met.—NNI
There are some adorable contenders for the Bristol Post Prize Pets 2017 competition.
It will be a tough call to choose which cat, dog, hamster or chameleon deserves the top prize.
But it is much easier to spot the pets with the most weird and wonderful names. Why choose boring Fido or dull Rex when you can name your precious pet Frankie Noodle, Onion, Sir Teddy Bear Cox, Thumbs, or Zeus Chewbacca?
This year's entrants included a dog called Frazer Rudducks, a parrot called Dude, a cat called Indiana Jones, a rabbit called Private Eye, a hedgehog called Clover, a chicken called Lala, and a chameleon called Arlo Hercules.
In the shortlist there are two Brians, twelves Bellas, three Bears, two Franks and three Frankies, three Lokis, nine Lunas, two Merlins, four Peanuts, two Tigers and three Tiggers.
But the staff favourite at the Post has to be a grey cat called Phatimus Maximus Pizza Hut Storm Aka Phatboy. Agree? Our only worry is that some of these names may soon be given to babies.
Entries to the The Bristol Post Prize Pets 2017 competition have now closed. The winner and two runners-up will be announced on Monday, September 18. Go to bristolpost.co.uk/prizepets to find out more.
A Condom Company Released A Spicy Pickle Flavor
Trending News: Now They're Making Condoms In Really Gross Flavors For Some Reason
Long Story Short
A condom company in India has come out with a spicy pickle flavored condom and we hope the trend doesn't catch on.
Long Story
Are you a savory rather than a sweet person? Well, now there's finally a condom for you (even though you definitely didn't ask for it).
Manforce condoms has released a new condom flavored to taste like achaar, a South Asian dish that features pickled vegetables in a spicy oil. In other words, a spicy pickle flavored condom.
Manforce already offers a bizarre list of flavors like coffee, pineapple and bubble gum, but this one takes the cake.
Twitter was understandably fearful of the repercussions.

According to an ad marketer interviewed by the BBC, the spicy pickle flavor is just a publicity stunt.
"Such campaigns are mostly so that companies can make the news and draw attention to their business," Sunil Lulla, the head of Grey ad agency, told the BBC, adding that only the company would be able to say if these gimmicks actually translated into sales. "However if it is spicing up sexual enjoyment and conversation around safe sex in India, then such efforts should be encouraged."
Ok maybe, but we've seen ice cream flavors that run the gamut, so why not condom flavors?
Ok, I see your point.

Will bizarre condom flavors catch on elsewhere?

If latex condoms don't feel good or taste right, there's a bunch of good quality non-latex condoms to choose from.
CemAir has vowed it would get back into the sky swiftly following the grounding of its aircraft by the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) on Friday.
The halting of passenger flights for the OR Tambo-based airline came after Certificates of Airworthiness were withdrawn for 24 hours – a period of time that expires at 5am on Saturday.
The decision to withdraw the certificates came after aviation inspectors found during an audit that some of the aircraft services by the airline's maintenance organisation were released back into service or cleared as airworthy by unqualified personnel.
But in a statement released on CemAir's social media channels on Friday‚ the airline described the saga as a “paperwork discrepancy”.
“CemAir is working with the (SACCA) to resolve the issue as expeditiously as possible. The airline is making alternate arrangements for passengers on its flights on Friday‚ February 2‚ 2018.
“Once further information is available this will be communicated as soon as possible. CemAir remains committed to serving our passengers and regrets the inconvenience caused by the interruption of service‚” the statement said.
CemAir flies to Bloemfontein‚ George‚ Cape Town‚ Hoedspruit‚ Margate‚ Plettenberg Bay and Port Elizabeth. The SACAA said that while it understood passengers would have disruptions for passengers‚ it was important to ensure the airline's safety was beyond reproach.
It said getting the all-clear from unqualified personnel posed “an imminent danger for crew members‚ passengers‚ and the public at large‚ and has a direct impact on aviation safety‚ since the airworthiness status of the aircraft concerned cannot be confirmed or is questionable”.
CemAir had given its full cooperation‚ the authority said.
Indonesia Open 2018: Kidambi Srikanth crashes out, PV Sindhu marches on

Kidambi Srikanth
A week after losing to Kento Momota at the Malaysia Open, Kidambi Srikanth failed to turn the tables as their title defence came to an end in the first round of the $1,250,000 Indonesia Open held at the Istora Gelora Bung Karno in Jakarta, Indonesia on Wednesday. PV Sindhu too was put to a stern test by 20-year-old Pornpawee Chochuwong, but they survived and made it through to the second round.
The fourth seeded Srikanth had lost to the in-form Momota in the semi-finals of the Malaysia Open in straight games. They did put up a much better account of themselves against the Asian champion at the Super 1000 event in Jakarta. However, it was still not enough to overcome the challenge of the Japanese, who pulled off a 12-21, 21-14, 21-15 win in exactly an hour.
Last year, the Indonesia Open was the first title for Srikanth in an absolutely stunning season, that saw them triumph at three other Superseries tournaments.
Sindhu, who went down to Tai Tzu Ying in three games in Malaysia last week, brought them fighting qualities to the fore again as they battled their young Thai opponent. The third seed recovered from losing the second game to register a 21-15, 19-21, 21-13 victory over the 24th ranked Chochuwong in 1 hour 4 minutes.
Next up for the India No. 1 women's singles shuttler is the 16th ranked Aya Ohori of Japan.
The 22-year-old Indian was the only winner from the contingent on a day of disappointments for Indians. Rising star Vaishnavi Reddy Jakka was outplayed 12-21, 10-21 by World No. 25 Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt of Denmark.
The Indian national men's doubles champions Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy put up a brave fight against the third seeds Liu Cheng and Zhang Nan only to suffer a 21-15, 15-21, 17-21 defeat in the end.
India's top mixed doubles a pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy too went down 12-21, 14-21 to the fourth seeds Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong.
British media reported earlier this year that London's Metropolitan Police force was investigating allegations against the former House of Cards star.
LONDON—British police are investigating six claims of sexual assault or assault by Academy Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey, three more than previously disclosed.
Police in Britain don't name suspects until they are charged. Asked about Spacey, the force did not identify them by name but said Wednesday that detectives were investigating allegations of sexual assault alleged to have taken place in London's Westminster borough in 1996 and the western England city of Gloucester in 2013.
The force says three other complaints of sexual assault and one of assault by the same suspect have been made.
Spacey was artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre for 11 years until 2015.
new Hull City head coach Leonid Slutsky has stressed that they are targeting promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt.
Slutsky became the first Russian manager in the Football League last week when they replaced Marco Silva, who left to become Watford boss.
In order to achieve their aim, the ex-CSKA Moscow and Russia manager, 46, is likely to have to rebuild the Hull squad, with several leading players set to leave.
Most prominent among that number is defender Harry Maguire, reportedly the subject of a £16.5m bid from Leicester City.
A move to the East Midlands would also hand a seven-figure windfall to Maguire's former club Sheffield United, who are understood to have a 10 per cent sell-on clause inserted in any sale.
On their aim of sealing promotion at the first time of asking, Slutsky, who has spoken to Chelsea owner and good friend Roman Adramovich about potentially bringing in some players on loan, said: “Yes of course it is our first target to come back to the Premier League and get promoted next season.
“I understand it is a very difficult target, but I am sure it is possible.
“Hull had two seasons in the Championship in the last five years and always (got) promoted and I think it will be the same situation.
“Of course now there are a lot of questions about the squad, but it is a normal situation about a team who is relegated.”
Meanwhile, midfielder Ryan Mason is back in training as they work towards regaining full fitness after fracturing their skull.
The 26-year-old had 14 plates inserted into their skull and spent eight days in a London hospital following a sickening clash of heads with Chelsea defender Gary Cahill at Stamford Bridge on January 22.
Drivers are facing delays this afternoon after a crash near Bubbenhall.
Traffic is forming on the northbound A445 after the crash near the junction with Watery Lane.
Police are currently at the scene directing traffic.

Arsenal took all three points from their trip to Middlesbrough on Monday night to break a run of four straight away defeats.
In all the Gunners fans were chuffed with the display, not only did Arsene Wenger prove they are susceptible to change but their top players turned up.
Wenger surprised the world by switching to a back three for the clash, Sanchez, who has been quiet in recent weeks, found the back of the net, and Mesut Ozil, who has been quiet in recent months, also got themselves on the scoresheet.

For the most part it was a pretty comfortable win, but Arsenal did concede a sloppy goal to draw the score level moments after the break.
And some Gunners supporters took to social media to do some analysis of their own, looking at what went wrong.
Sanchez was on the ball moments before Middlesbrough scored, and was in fact instigating an Arsenal attack.

However they gave the ball away with a sloppy pass, and the home side reacted through Stewart Downing, who found Alvaro Negredo, who in turn found the back of the net.
And well there were many who weren't best pleased with the Chilean:
Fortunately for Arsenal, Ozil came to the rescue in their 2-1 and Sanchez took to celebrating in a pretty special way.
After running over to the fans, who only last week against Crystal Palace made their frustration known to the players, they picked out a young girl.
The 28-year-old then handed them their match-worn shirt, and well, made them day.
Casual restaurant chains are staging a comeback. The sit-down restaurants known for large portions and dim lighting, such as Ruby Tuesday and Red Lobster, had been losing customers to eateries offering faster and healthier options. In the past two years, declining sales forced dozens of chains to close locations or file for chapter 11.

But after changing hands, changing management or restructuring, many casual-dining chains are reinventing themselves to be more contemporary. They are swapping out giant portions of food for small plates, and upgrading ingredients and decor. Recent sales trends across the sector show promise. Same-store sales at casual-dining restaurants rose half a per cent this year through April, compared with a 1.1 per cent decline in the prior-year period, according to restaurant consultant Malcolm Knapp. Casual-dining restaurants had their heyday in the 1990s when diners sat down for a meal and had fewer options from which to choose. With the rise of fast-casual chains — places like Panera Bread that offer food from a counter but are considered a step up from fast food — time-pressed consumers now have a range of quick-dining choices. Casual sit-down restaurants, however, still make up 34 per cent of the $560 billion in total restaurant industry sales, according to Technomic Inc.

Restaurant veteran Bradley Blum said the sector has merely been dormant. “There just hasn't been much innovation lately,” they said. Mr. Blum in May bought casual-dining chains Brio Tuscan Grille and Bravo Cucina Italiana in partnership with Brazilian investment firm GP Investments Ltd. and plans to revive the chains by switching to better quality olive oil and pasta, and adding more seafood and plant-based foods. They also plan to remodel the venues to be open and light. TGI Fridays, a 53-year-old brand that came under new management last summer, is working to improve the dining experience for people who eat at the restaurants. TGI Fridays is also focusing on its to-go business, which has reached as high as 11 per cent of sales, up from 6 per cent a year ago. “Some brands in this sector have focused on one and not the other, but it's important to do both,” said Stephanie Perdue, the company's marketing chief. The privately held company has redesigned about half of its 440 U.S. restaurants, some of which now have open kitchens. It switched to a blend of chuck and brisket for its burgers, from ground sirloin and chuck; launched a meatless burger; and moved to meatier ribs. The chain has seen a 15 per cent sales increase from menu items that have been improved since October 2017, Ms. Perdue said.
Casual-dining chains are taking cues from Olive Garden, which showed how a struggling brand can turn around. The chain, owned by Darden Restaurants Inc., was the focus of an activist coup in 2014 that resulted in the ouster of the board and a renewed focus on restaurant operations. After streamlining food preparation, boosting alcohol sales and serving fresher bread sticks, the chain reversed a sales decline. In June, Olive Garden reported its 15th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, with a 2.4 per cent increase. Red Lobster had declining sales when it was owned by Darden, but it has been gaining back customers, opening new restaurants and growing its takeout business since being acquired by Golden Gate Capital in 2014, according to Red Lobster Chief Executive Kim Lopdrup.

The company added smaller tasting plates with more urbane dishes like tuna poke. It began offering online ordering in January and is experimenting with new store designs that include a dedicated takeout area. The 749-unit chain also is delivering food. Josh Benn, managing director at corporate-finance advisory firm Duff & Phelps Corp., said there will likely be more restaurant closures before the sector can fully regain health. Some restaurants still are experiencing sales declines. Chili's Grill & Bar's U.S. restaurants posted a same-store sales decrease of 1.1 per cent in its fiscal third quarter, compared with the prior-year period. The chain, owned by Brinker International Inc., remains in the midst of a turnaround effort as it has changed its menu and is looking to provide “a faster, more consistent and convenient experience,” Brinker CEO Wyman Roberts told investors in May. Applebee's second-largest franchisee filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in May. Applebee's parent company, Dine Brands Global Inc., last year named a new CEO and decided to focus on its middle-America customer base with menu items that have broad appeal. Things are starting to look up for the chain, which reported a 3.3 per cent increase in same-store sales in the first quarter, its second consecutive quarter of sales improvement. “We're stealing share from our competitors and delivering the best sustained traffic performance we've experienced in more than a decade,” said Applebee's President John Cywinski, who added that the chain is taking customers from other casual-dining brands. Private-equity firm NRD Capital Management bought the struggling Ruby Tuesday chain last year, after it closed 100 restaurants. The first step is to differentiate itself, said Aziz Hashim, the firm's founder and managing partner. “There's this joke that you could retitle the cover of any casual-dining restaurant menu and not tell the difference,” they said. Ruby Tuesday, which started in Knoxville, Tenn., is developing healthier dishes and returning to its Southern roots with new menu items such as the Smoky Mountain chicken sandwich and Hickory Bourbon salmon. Mr. Hashim said: “Casual dining is not going anywhere, it just has to be reinvented.”
Trump May Soon Announce Plans To Combat Opioid Crisis
David Greene talks to David Mara, appointed by the governor of New Hampshire to be the state's drug czar, who's waiting to see if President Trump mentions the crisis in a speech Monday.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
President Trump is revisiting a campaign promise today while he's visiting New Hampshire. The president is going to talk about the opioid crisis. It is a problem they promised to help solve while they were campaigning in that state in 2016. The Trump administration has not done much about the crisis so far, though the president outlined a broad approach in a speech earlier this month.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness. When you catch a drug dealer, you got to - you got to put them away for a long time.
GREENE: Not just put them away, the president also pointed out that China executes its drug dealers, so we are likely to hear a hard-line approach in this speech today. And among those listening will be David Mara. He's a former police chief who has been appointed by New Hampshire's governor as the state's drug czar, and they join us this morning. Thanks for taking the time. We appreciate it.
DAVID MARA: Thank you, glad to be here.
GREENE: I saw one report from New Hampshire Public Radio that in one county in your state, 90 percent of calls to police are related to opioids. How severe is this crisis?
MARA: Well, proportionately, New Hampshire was hit hard. A lot of different states in the region were as well. But we had 485 overdose deaths in 2016. And if you look at that in proportion to our population, which is roughly about 1.35 million, it is a big problem.
GREENE: Is there something specific that you hope to hear from the president today that can at least begin to bring those numbers down and help people?
MARA: Well, it's not just the president I'm looking forward to hearing. I'm looking forward to what is going to happen later this month as far as funding goes. That is what the - that is what we're looking at, funding. The last round of funding for this problem nationwide was based on population as opposed to proportion to the problem. So we're looking at funding and that is - that is the way that we are hoping to be able to build capacity to be able to treat people and treat the disease of addiction.
GREENE: You're saying that states that are hit the hardest should at least have a chance to get more money. It shouldn't just be based on the population of states.
MARA: Exactly.
GREENE: What would you do with more money?
MARA: Again, we have - what we would do is we'd fill the gaps that we've identified. We know that we need transitional housing. We know that we need more recovery peer support groups. We know that we need to be able to provide people with an environment where they feel comfortable coming in to get treatment. And there's a stigma involved with this. We need to educate and do more prevention as well. We need to stop the next generation for getting caught up in this trap of addiction with opioids.
GREENE: I heard you just say that one of the keys is for people to feel comfortable coming in. I listen to some of the things the president says. They talk about how important it is in terms of law enforcement, in terms of potentially, you know, the death penalty for dealers. Is there a way to talk tough like that without causing people who might be using to go back into the shadows and fear coming in and getting treatment?
MARA: In New Hampshire, when we talk about enforcement, we're talking about stiff penalties. We're talking about the people that are peddling this poison. We're talking about the people that are bringing in quantities of fentanyl into the state and causing these deaths. We have drug courts in every single one of our counties except one, and we're working on that. And if somebody has committed a crime, a drug-related crime, that is not a danger to community or is not that severe, we're more interested in getting involved in drug court getting them treatment as opposed to incarcerating them.
GREENE: So you think there's a way to be tough on the people who are perpetuating this crisis without causing people who need treatment to worry about coming out into the open.
MARA: Yes. Enforcement's one part of the whole picture. It's prevention, it's treatment, it's recovery. And enforcement is necessary because, like I said, fentanyl is what's causing all these deaths. People do not know what they're putting into their bodies.
GREENE: All right. David Mara is a former police chief who now serves as New Hampshire's drug czar. And President Trump will be visiting that state today. Thanks so much.
MARA: Thank you, glad to be here.

A Snapchat addict who posted a video of their dying boyfriend after allegedly arranging their murder told a court they were beaten by them in the past.
Fatima Khan, 21, is alleged to have urged Raza Khan, 19, to stab their 18-year-old Khalid Safi after keeping them waiting outside Costa Coffee in Acton, west London.
They then filmed the scene and posted it on Snapchat with the caption, 'This is what happens when you f*** with me,' the Old Bailey heard.
While Fatima Khan admitted their behaviour was 'disgusting', they said they were 'thinking about what had happened to me previously when Khalid punched me'.
Giving evidence, they said: 'I remember seeing like a tip of something sharp. I was panicking.'
Them defence counsel, Kerim Fuad QC, asked: 'Is your phone out at this stage?'
'Yes,' they replied.
Fatima Khan claimed Mr Safi had hit them in the past and that another man had been convicted of attacking them
(Image: central news)
Mr Fuad asked: 'When you were walking along there, what were you thinking?'
'I was thinking about what had happened to me previously when Khalid punched me,' they replied.
Mr Fuad: 'Looking back now, taking these images and posting them, which you later did, tell the jury what you feel about that now.'
Through tears Fatima Khan said: 'It is so shameful. It's disgusting. It wasn't even directed at Khalid - the message wasn't for him.
'I was just tired of it, getting assaulted before and them punching me again. I just wrote that so that people didn't try to assault me or harrass me.'
Mr Safi, a refugee from Afghanistan who spent time in the Calais 'Jungle' before settling in the UK five years ago, suffered a stab wound to the heart and died outside the cafe.
Mr Fuad continued: 'You then walked away, what state did you think Khalid was in?'
Fatima Khan replied: 'I wasn't sure - I saw there was some blood, it was on the side of their head and chin and there was lots of blood on the floor.'
They told the court that they saw the feathers from Safi's puffa jacket flying around outside the Costa.
The barrister continued: 'Do you remember members of the public asking you, or raising eyebrows, about why you were taking pictures?'
'My hand was shaking, I didn't turn the flash off and someone asked me, "are you going to put that on Facebook?" and I said, "no, I want to send it to my sister." '
(Image: PA)
Mr Fuad then went on to ask them what was said on a phone call between them and the man who had just stabbed their boyfriend in front of them eyes.
'I was swearing so much and shouting - they aren't really responding. I could hear cars passing and I could hear the wind - it sounded like they were running.'
Earlier Mr Fuad had told the court in their defence speech: 'That young woman was hugely callous, crass even in taking that image of Khalid on the pavement and posting it with those words.
'If there was a charge of being callous and crass in the aftermath of this shocking incident then they would plead guilty to that charge.'
Fatima Khan, of Jersey Road, Ilford, denies murder and conspiracy to cause GBH.
The trial continues.
MONTREAL—An employee in the prime minister's office has resigned after an investigation into unspecified allegations against him.
A spokesperson for the PMO says Claude-Éric Gagné is no longer an employee in Justin Trudeau's office.
Eleanore Catenaro declined further comment in an email, calling it a confidential matter.
Gagné, the deputy director of operations, had been on leave since Nov. 1 pending the outcome of an investigation by a third-party investigator — Rubin Thomlinson, a prominent employment law firm.
They have said previously that they challenged the veracity of the allegations.

Sheridan Smith has revealed they almost gave up performing following the death of their dad Colin Smith.
In 2016, the 36-year-old actor was left devastated by the loss of their dad and pulled out of an appearance at the Royal Variety Performance shortly afterwards, sparking concern among their fans.
I parents - Colin and Marilyn - formed the Country and Western duo, The Daltons, and Sheridan and their brother Damian, who is part of the band The Torn, often performed with them on stage.
On Tuesday night, during a show at the Royal Albert Hall as part of their sell-out tour which follows the release of self-titled album Sheridan, the tearful actor told the audience: "I did the album for my dad.

"There was a time, as everyone goes through, I kind of just lost it and I was totally going to give it all up.
"And the reason I didn't is you guys. I've met so many of you guys and you're the reason I get up. You're so supportive."
Introducing a rendition of This Is Me from the film The Greatest Showman, they said: "This next song I would like to dedicate to my daddy. If my dad was here they would be saying shake every single one of your hands, they were so proud."

Sheridan opened their show with a rendition of Crazy by Gnarls Barkley and concluded it with an encore of I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.
Throughout the performance they also treated fans to renditions of 9 to 5 by Dolly Parton and Shirley Bassey's Big Spender.

ASHEVILLE, N.C. — Ahmad Thomas scored 19 of their 24 points in the second half when UNC Asheville pulled away for a 75-61 victory over Presbyterian on Saturday and took sole possession of first place in the Big South.
Thomas grabbed a career-high 14 rebounds, just missing a triple-double with nine assists. Raekwon Miller added 14 points and Jonathan Baehre 11 with five blocks for the Bulldogs (16-9, 9-3), who are alone atop the conference with Radford (8-4) losing to Winthrop (8-4) earlier Saturday.
The Bulldogs have won five straight and eight of their last nine in improving to 11-0 at home, 20-0 dating to last season.
Asheville took the lead for good at 11:20 of the first half, which ended 37-31. The Bulldogs led 65-57 with six minutes left before finishing on a 12-4 run.

London's Parliament Square Gets Its First Statue Honoring A Woman
Enlarge this image toggle caption Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images Stefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images
For nearly 150 years, it's been men only: Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi and seven other statesmen. But on Tuesday, the statuary in London's Parliament Square got a new face: suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett.
British Prime Minister Theresa May spoke at the unveiling ceremony and hailed Fawcett as a pioneering feminist who was instrumental in gaining political agency and power for women throughout the country.
"I would not be standing here today as prime minister, no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett," May said.
The bronze statue depicts Fawcett at age 50 as they were awarded a brooch from the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In their hands is a placard that reads, "Courage Calls To Courage Everywhere," which was taken from a speech they gave after the death of fellow suffragist Emily Wilding Davison at the 1913 Epsom Derby.
Author Interviews 'The Woman's Hour' Documents Pivotal Leaders In The Fight For Suffrage 'The Woman's Hour' Documents Pivotal Leaders In The Fight For Suffrage Listen · 8:48 8:48
Born in 1847, Fawcett dedicated much of their life to fighting for women's rights. They began campaigning for the right to vote at age 19 and quickly became well known as a speaker and organizer. They became president of the NUWSS in 1907 and worked to broaden the group's base to include working-class women. They died in 1929, a year after all women over the age of 21 were granted the right to vote.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan noted Fawcett's inclusion, or that of any woman in Parliament Square, is long overdue.
"When you think of the great people in Parliament Square and when you realize that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven't been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn't been built on the back of great women?" Khan said.
The campaign to include a statue of a woman was launched by activist Caroline Criado Perez. They told the BBC that they were jogging past the historic square on International Women's Day in 2016 when they when noticed the absence of any female figures. They started the campaign "as they sat on a bench outside Buckingham Palace at the end of their run," according to the broadcaster.
"If [Fawcett] were a man, she'd have hundreds of statues up to her," Criado Perez told the BBC. "She's directly facing Parliament with their placard, so the MPs can see them everyday and think, 'I should probably go and sort that problem out.' "
Fawcett's monument is also the first in the square to be created by a female artist — Gillian Wearing, a conceptual artist who won the Turner Prize in 1997.
"Other designers and artists just didn't get it like Gillian did," Criado Perez told the BBC. "For me, it was very important [Millicent] was middle aged. I wanted them to be standing there not at all sexualised, but statesmanlike."
Criado-Perez previously campaigned successfully to make Jane Austen the new face of Britain's 10-pound note.

Pompeo Meets With Top North Korean Official In Hopes Of Reviving Singapore Summit
Enlarge this image toggle caption Julie Jacobson/AP Julie Jacobson/AP
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with a top North Korean official over dinner in New York on Wednesday, as the two sought to salvage a June 12 summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un.
The summit, planned since April, was called off just a week ago by Trump amid a renewed round of heated rhetoric from Pyongyang and concerns over whether North Korea was sincere about "denuclearization." Within days of cancelling the summit, however, there was talk of getting it back on track.
The meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong Chol, North Korea's former military intelligence chief, marks the highest-level official visit by a North Korean to the U.S. since 2000.
As we reported previously, Kim Yong Chol "is a veteran of diplomacy with South Korea who is considered to be Kim Jong-un's right-hand man. ... Kim is also widely believed to be behind the 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean Naval vessel, in which 46 seamen died."
Pompeo's office said the two officials were planning a "day full of meetings" on Thursday, but there was still no certainty on whether the summit would even take place.
"If it happens, we'll certainly be ready," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the daily briefing Wednesday. "We're going to continue to shoot for June 12th."
As the two were meeting, so were lower-level U.S. and North Korean diplomats – both in Singapore, the planned venue for the historic summit, and at the Koreas border.
In recent months, Pyongyang had toned down its normally bombastic tone aimed at the U.S. and South Korea. In a rare meeting in April, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shook hands at the heavily fortified border in a gesture of good will that seemed to presage a broader rapprochement.
That was followed up by a secret visit by Pompeo to North Korea before the former CIA director had even been confirmed in their new job as secretary of state.
However, Pyongyang quickly asserted that its pledge to "denuclearize"
did not mean a unilateral surrender of its nuclear weapons program.
Pyongyang was also angered by remarks made by newly installed National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said in a television interview that denuclearization in North Korea might follow the same path as in Libya – implying the possibility of violent regime change.
Later, in an apparent effort at damage control, Vice President Mike Pence seemed to only make matters worse, suggesting that sitting down for talks was the only way Kim Jong-un could escape such a fate.
A Doncaster pension firm is set to move its 100 employees into a new town centre base next week.
My Pension Expert, which is currently based in Auckley, is moving its headquarters to the Colonnades shopping centre in Doncaster town centre.
The firm will move into Colonnades House, the office block formerly occupied by Doncaster Council on Duke Street, from Monday.
The company, one of the largest employers in Doncaster and one of the UK's leading at-retirement advisers says the move will create easier access for employees and strengthens MPE's commitment to growing the business in Doncaster.
A spokesperson said: "With the train station 300 metres away, employees and business partners across the UK will enjoy much easier access to our headquarters.
"MPE is one of Doncaster's largest employers and the office move strengthens its commitment to growing the business in the town."
Currently employing 95 people, the relocation will allow MPE to continue sourcing top local talent to strengthen its workforce.
Andrew Megson, executive chairperson of MPE said, “MPE now has a building to match its ambition. Our decision to move strengthens our commitment to continuing our growth in Doncaster; the hub of South Yorkshire.
“We are in the midst of an exciting new chapter. With many more innovative developments in the pipeline, MPE will continue to go from strength to strength”.
The firm is moving from its premises in Hayfield Business Park near Robin Hood Airport.

A DECOMPOSING fin whale has left a thick, oily slick in the normally crystal clear waters near Albany, Western Australia.
Aerial photographs of the rotting carcass which washed ashore on Cheynes Beach, 470km south of Perth, show the enormous scale of the 50-tonne whale, which measures up to 23m.
The rotting flesh was "very smelly" according to photographer Matt Smith. And it's attracting its share of sharks.
Footage from above shows a number of sharks swimming close to shore, drawn in by the blubber and oil in the water. It's believed the sharks were as big as 5m and are believed to be great whites.

The whale was so large it had to be cut up with a flensing knife and a chainsaw, the photographer said on Facebook.
The West Australian reports six truckloads of flesh, blubber and bones were taken from the shoreline to landfill in Albany on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The beach was closed by City of Albany rangers as the deconstruction process got underway. Photographs show the bloated mammal being manoeuvred by an excavator. The machine struggles under the weight of the 50 tonne carcass.
Fin whales are rarely seen and are endangered. Whales migrate along the southern coast of WA at the start of Winter each year.
LONDON, Ont. — Chris Merchant threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns as the No. 4 Western Mustangs crushed the Carleton Ravens 51-14 on Friday night in U Sports football action.
The win secured Western (7-0) top spot in the Ontario University Athletics conference standings. The Mustangs will receive a bye into the conference semifinals and have home-field advantage throughout the post-season.
Merchant finished 20 of 34 and was intercepted twice.
Alex Taylor ran for 142 yards on 15 carries with one touchdown. It's their third consecutive 100-plus yard game. They also caught four passes for 50 yards and one score. Cedric Joseph added two rushing TDs after carrying the ball 10 times for 81 yards.
A man has died in a single vehicle at Sandy Beach tonight.
A MAN has died following a single vehicle accident at Sandy Beach tonight.
The 28-year-old was the sole occupant of a Mazda sedan that rolled several times on Holloways Rd after the vehicle left the roadway around 6.30pm.
Coffs Clarence Police Acting Inspector Bob White said paramedics and police on scene attempted to revive the man, but they were pronounced deceased on arrival at Coffs Harbour Base Hospital.
A crash scene investigation into the accident is being conducted.
It is understood the vehicle was travelling east at the time.
Ride-hailing service Lyft will launch its service in Toronto on Tuesday, marking its first expansion outside the United States.
The addition of Lyft brings increased competition to Uber in Canada's largest city.
The company announced plans to expand to Toronto last month, but had not set a date for its start.
Lyft will operate between Hamilton and Oshawa, Ont., and as far north as Newmarket, Ont.
Uber arrived in Canada several years ago and has fought an uphill regulatory battle ever since.
HOW do kids exercise self-discipline and personal responsibility if it is never taught but then demanded of them?
At some point, we seem we adopted the knee jerk approach to social cohesion and parenting in this country by insisting a ban is the solution to anything too arduous or time consuming to tackle.
So kids getting fat because they're choosing a packet of sugar-laced snacks instead of an apple? We'd better ban junk food at school.
Teens with a newly-minted driver's license driving too fast? Best install an electronic stalking device in their car to check their speed.
And while you're at it, install a tracking device via your smartphone so you can see where they are at all times even if they aren't driving. It's a foolproof concept - kids are always glued to their phones after all.
That way they will be okay, in reality a false safety net when common sense is lacking.
Labels on soft drinks, a trigger warning on a Peter Rabbit movie this year because it includes a sub plot about food allergies or an ethos that having a best friend as a child must be actively discouraged because it is "inherently exclusionary".
These are the hurdles lurking before the modern parent.
No matter that kids are naturally inclusive and less judgmental than us adults. What will be self-righteous mob rally for next week - a ban on free thinking?
And if kids do look up from their screens, they'll see adults so tangled up in a politically correct web that using the phrase white to describe just about anything can trigger a lynch mob.
Life is becoming all about control minus the actual personal responsibility, the one thing our kids desperately need us to teach them.
Kids refusing to eat? Surely there's an app for that.
Raising children to achieve great levels of success seems a hollow objective if they can't hold themselves accountable for their actions.
But the ban it all solution was back on the agenda this week when a Finnish education expert Pasi Sahlberg urged us to veto mobile phones in Aussie primary schools.
Dr Sahlberg said prohibiting the devices for juniors and teaching self-discipline for secondary students was crucial to stopping the havoc phones, in particular, wreak on classroom behaviour and learning.
High schools should "act quickly' to plug the damage, they said.
"Smartphones don't belong in primary schools or young children under 12. For the sake of fairness and equity, (banning them in early years) would be the best thing to do," they said in an interview.
But we are fuelling a generation that doesn't know how to be held accountable so surely banning them for kids under 12 teaches them nothing.
Kids by nature are impulsive creatures and they need to learn the skills to manage that. This helps them to become responsible for their actions, respectful of consequences and aware of the impact of their behaviour on others. It helps them distinguish between good choices and bad choices.
And it's our job as parents to model personal responsibility - not schools.
We live in a world of acute instant gratification. We wait for nothing unless we really have to and if we can't 'have it now' we don't want it.
Choosing the right course of behaviour by thinking things through is becoming the taboo of our time.
How sad is it that we are losing that thrill of anticipation, the challenge of patience.
Why do we want to deny our children these important facets of being a well-rounded human? I think it is because we are afraid they won't like us any more if we say no.
Recently at a local swimming pool, I saw a mum pull out five different costumes and ask their daughter, stood there with their five-year-old arms crossed, which one they wanted to wear.
The hot pink one made it into the warm water and the mum, exhausted by the burden that they had created of negotiating too much choice, sat heavily on the steel seats and absorbed themselves in an iPad.

The same routine followed after the swim - tracksuit pants or PJs, the blue ones or the Disney ones? And so on.
For this child, the question is whether they ever learn to be happy with what they have got. That contentment and acceptance leads directly to taking responsibility for your own thoughts and actions.
Not only is it exhausting for the parent, as they run rings around their little darlings but they are setting up themselves and their children for a lifetime of misery.
While this ritual - which is far more common than it should be - might give you a giggle, it becomes a power struggle that is anything but funny.
Like all humans, children love power and they learn pretty quickly how to wield it. Crying, refusing to eat certain foods, refusing to go to bed are all normal exertions of it.
It is how the parent chooses to respond that matters. Will they foster a little human who can accept they don't get to make all the decisions because mum and dad is boss, at least for now; or will they find the power struggle too adorable, too funny or just too hard to exert their authority?
Millennials are routinely rubbished for their 'me, me, me' mindset but whether it is accurate or not, our children will struggle to operate outside this mindset unless we drive home the importance of individual, personal responsibility.
They crave boundaries and direction because it helps them to know where they stand in their little world.
Some parents are so determined to keep the peace, that they will do anything.
Your children will not thank you for it when they reach adolescence and someone offers them drugs and they don't want them but they haven't learned the power of no plus the power of staying true to that two-letter word.
Would the experts that would have us ban phones from schools also advocate a device to prevent kids swallowing any illegal or toxic substance when they are away from home?
Would they advocate the microchipping of newborns so that parents and carers can always know how and where they are?
And should we lock fridges and pantries so children can't be tempted by unhealthy food?
Instead, teach those children to check in with their parents and carers, praise them when they do so and enforce consequences when they don't.
We can't expect perfection from our children, they will stuff up and stumble and make mistakes, wilfully or otherwise, but it is not the mistake that matters as much as the response from a parent, and the demand for accountability
Klopp full of praise for 'young horse' Nagelsmann
Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp believes Hoffenheim's Julian Nagelsmann is a strong example of Germany's promising young coaches.
by Omnisport News 14 Aug 2017, 22:42 IST
Hoffenheim head coach Julian Nagelsmann
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has described Hoffenheim boss Julian Nagelsmann as "a young horse" with an extremely bright future.
Nagelsmann became the youngest head coach in Bundesliga history when they were appointed at the age of 28 in October 2015 and has won admirers across the country for their work over the last two years.
Klopp hailed Nagelsmann as a shining example of Germany's promising coaching talent and expects a difficult task when Liverpool face Hoffenheim in the first leg of their Champions League play-off on Tuesday.
"I'm really happy for my friend and agent because I'm the old horse in the stable and there's a young horse already!" Klopp told a news conference.
"He's a big, big coaching talent. We don't know each other very well but I've followed their way because I like good football.
"He's not the only one but he's a good example of a lot of really good young managers in Germany.
"We're looking forward to the game, knowing about the quality of the opponent. It's just good to be here and have the chance, even when you know it's really hard.
"They are strong, we are strong. That's how it should be."
Liverpool last played a Champions League match against Basel in the group stage of the 2014-15 season but the five-time European champions are the favourites to progress from the tie.
Klopp, however, does not believe their side's level of experience compared to Hoffenheim's will be an advantage.
"I'm not really interested in the experience an opponent has," they said. "We've been together for 20 months, I think, we always try to give good analysis for our players.
"We show them images of the opponent and they speak for themselves. We have an opponent who are very strong, aggressive, who use tactical fouls. We know about their quality and what they do on the pitch and we know it will be difficult like it always is in the Champions League."
DCGI will send show-cause notices to firms on Tuesday for selling combination drugs to treat diabetes and fungal infection without mandatory prior approval. Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/Mint
New Delhi: Worries over combination drugs flooding the Indian market without being tested for efficacy or safety emerged again, with many domestic drugmakers coming under the scanner after raids by the central drug licensing authority last week.
An inquiry has been initiated by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) against Wockhardt Ltd, Ambic Aayurchem Ltd, Mascot Health Series Pvt. Ltd and Medley Pharmaceuticals Ltd, after the raids allegedly revealed that the companies were selling fixed dose combination (FDC) drugs without conducting safety trials.
The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) will send show-cause notices to these companies on Tuesday for selling combination drugs to treat diabetes and fungal infection without mandatory prior approval, asking them to reply within 10 days, failing which legal action will be initiated against them under the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
According to the rules, new drugs cannot be sold unless they are approved by DCGI.
The DCGI office on Monday wrote to the Union health ministry asking it to instruct state licensing authorities (SLAs) to cancel product permissions of these companies.
“The health secretary will soon write to the Chief secretary of Uttarakhand issuing directions under section 33P of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act to instruct their drugs licensing authorities to refrain from granting such licences. The secretary will also write to the principal secretaries of all the states to examine if any new drug approvals have been granted by the state licensing authorities without prior approval from the CDSCO,” said one of the two people cited above.
DCGI is also contemplating setting up an “intelligence cell” that will monitor the availability and movement of products.
According to CDSCO's clinical trials rules, if the product is approved elsewhere and not in India, phase III clinical trials and bioequivalence studies are required to establish its safety and efficacy on the Indian population.
“Permission from the office of the DCGI is required in respect of FDCs falling under definition of ‘New Drugs' before these are licensed by SLAs for manufacture for sale in the country. However, SLAs were granting licences without due approval from DCGI,” said a senior health ministry official.
As reported first by Mint on Friday, the companies had come under the scanner of CDSCO for allegedly selling drugs without conducting safety trials, thereby risking the lives of patients.
With reference to the news item that appeared in Mint, Wockhardt told BSE that it is “marketing the product (Itraconazole 100 mg and Terbinafine 250 mg tablets) which is manufactured by Mascot Health Series Pvt. Ltd.(‘Mascot'). Mascot has informed the Company that they have valid FDA licence from October 2015. Kindly take the same on your record.”
During raids, authorities seized 10,000 tablets of an antifungal combination of itraconazole 100mg and terbinafine 250mg made in Haridwar by Mascot and sold by Wockhardt.
Narendra Kukreja, managing director of Mascot, said the issue has been blown out of proportion. “For all these products necessary approval from state authorities were taken. We have followed the rules,” they said.
Emails sent to Ambic and Medley did not elicit any response till the press time.
Re: Trump slow to respond to violence in Virginia, Aug. 13 Trump slow to respond to violence in Virginia, Aug. 13 U.S. President Donald Trump's response to the rioting is hypocritical and hard to stomach. Calling out racist organizations who supported their political campaign and who responded to their attacks on Mexicans, Muslims and many more is a blatant corruption of the facts. Trump themselves has incited Americans to hatred, and now violence.

What a strange reality it is to come from the 1950s, when the U.S. still imposed racial segregation in schools, buses, washroom facilities, concerts, restaurants, stores and an endless list of public services. We would see the Ku Klux Klan on television covering their faces like the cowards they were. And now I see their successors, the same group of disenfranchised, mindless hordes that used to show up at public lynchings and hangings for entertainment. The biggest shock to me is how many of us don't learn from history. That hate is taught in the first place is enough to sicken even the hardest heart.
These are strange times, brought on by a man who is sick in their heart and mind.  They are a harbinger of what may come if we don't keep those who would embrace hate and intolerance in check. These people look upon them as entertainment because they're bored with the status quo. They have a longing, a hope for an alternate reality beyond what they have created with their miserable apathy and bland mediocrity. What a strange reality it is to witness the most powerful man in the world stand aloof and seemingly indifferent to the things taking place on their watch that assault our sensibilities. Donald Trump is not fit to hold the office of The President of The United States. Jay Paul Baldwin, Mississauga Athough Donald Trump's failure to call out white supremacists in Charlottesville is reprehensible, it provides one more reason why the nation should ignore them and look for leadership elsewhere. Hopefully, they will become largely irrelevant, a large boulder in a river, impeding but not stopping the water's flow. Unable to lead and addicted to self-aggrandizement, they are already being sidelined — even by some in their own cabinet. Shakespeare said, “uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.” In the case of Trump, it's the American public that is getting more than a little uneasy. Geoff Rytell, Toronto ‘I hardly recognize my country anymore,' Opinion, Aug. 14 Abraham Lincoln firmly believed that “government of the people, for the people, by the people” was essential for democracy to flourish.

BEIRUT (AP) - Lebanese police officials say an operative with Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group was killed when a bomb they were holding went off in their home in the country's south.
The officials say it isn't clear what the operative, identified as Bilal Hassan, was doing with the bomb and now it got onto theirs home.
Initial reports were conflicting. Lebanon's private Al-Jadeed TV says Hassan was actually holding a grenade cartridge for a rocket-propelled-grenade launcher.
The state-run National News Agency said a "strange object" exploded in their house on the edge of the southern port-city of Sidon.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
They said Hezbollah members inspected Hassan's house after the blast and were later followed by police officers who opened an investigation in the case.
MISSISSAUGA, Ont. — Police in the Toronto area say three unidentified men wanted in connection with a "vicious assault" on a 29-year-old autistic man may be from British Columbia.
Peel regional police say since releasing video showing the assault, investigators have received numerous tips that have led them to ask for help in B.C., particularly the Lower Mainland.
Officials say they have "credible information" that the people allegedly responsible for the attack at a bus terminal recently travelled to the Toronto area.
Video of the attack, which was made public last week, shows the autistic man sitting at the bottom of a bus terminal stairwell in Mississauga, Ont.

Woman Reported Missing In California Found On 'The Bachelor'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty Images Craig Sjodin/ABC via Getty Images
Intrigue around The Bachelor, ABC's long-running dating reality show, usually centers around rendered roses and resentful rivals, but one contestant on the current season made headlines this week for different reasons.
Rebekah Martinez, 22, has been seen weekly on television screens since Jan. 1 when the season debuted, and yet had also simultaneously been registered as a missing person in California's Humboldt County. That is, until astute viewers and the local newspaper helped set the record straight on Thursday.
On Nov. 18, Martinez's mother called the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office to file a missing person's report, saying they had not heard from their daughter for a week, reports The North Coast Journal.
A sheriff's spokesperson told the newspaper that Martinez told their mother they were going to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.
After trying to get ahold of Martinez and following up on leads, police asked Martinez's mother on Dec. 12 whether they had made contact with their daughter, reports People Magazine. The mother, who has not been identified, said that they did in fact hear from them on Nov. 18 after reporting them missing. And yet they were never removed from the missing persons list. Per procedure, police asked for Martinez to contact the investigator directly, the magazine reports. That didn't happen.
Martinez posted on Instagram on Sept. 17 — presumably around the time filming began for the 22nd season of the show — that they were giving up their "phone and social media for the next several weeks, so if you need to contact me, welll... tough luck!"
But far from flying under the radar, they resumed activity on social media in November, four days after their mother reported them missing and has continued posting regularly.
Yet on Thursday, Humboldt County's The North Coast Journal published a cover story featuring Martinez, headlined, "The Humboldt 35" exploring why the county has California's highest rate of reported missing persons.
After the newspaper posted the article to Facebook, readers pointed out that not only was Martinez not missing, they were a burgeoning reality television star, known as Bekah M., currently among the top 10 contestants whittled down from the original two dozen.
After the Journal contacted the Sheriff's office with the news, a deputy managed to get in touch with Martinez. The deputy said in an email, according to the newspaper, "I just got off the phone with Rebekah.  They are in fact the same person. They have been removed from (the Missing and Unidentified Persons Unit)."
The Humboldt 35 is now down to 33 after at least one other person was surprised to read they were officially missing. They called the newspaper to say they were alive and well and still living in the county with a roommate.
In California, a missing person is simply "someone whose whereabouts is unknown to the reporting party," as the state's Office of the Attorney General explains. "There is NO waiting period for reporting a person missing. All California police and sheriffs' departments must accept any report, including a report by telephone, of a missing person."
While Martinez has not explained the confusion directly, they did address it lightheartedly on Friday, tweeting, "honestly the scariest thing about this story is that my efforts to conceal The Worst Drivers License Photo Of All Time have been thwarted."
Valverde: Barça not as bad as scoreline suggests against Madrid
Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde does not feel Sunday's 3-1 loss to Real Madrid was an accurate reflection of their team's display.
by Omnisport News 14 Aug 2017, 06:17 IST
Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde
Barcelona head coach Ernesto Valverde does not believe the Supercopa de Espana scoreline was a true reflection of their side's performance against bitter rivals Real Madrid.
It was a night to forget for Barça, who went down 3-1 to Spanish and European champions Madrid in the first leg at Camp Nou on Sunday.
Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off with eight minutes remaining but Madrid still triumphed on enemy territory thanks to the four-time Ballon d'Or winner, Marco Asensio and an own goal from Gerard Pique.
Lionel Messi's 77th-minute penalty restored parity after Barça team-mate Pique turned the ball into their own net early in the second half, however, Madrid finished strongly to take control of the Supercopa.
Speaking to reporters post-match, Valverde said: "I don't have the feeling that we were as far away from [Real Madrid] as the scoreboard indicates.
"They scored three goals, but this was a game in which we played well and had chances.
"Reaching their danger zones isn't all that matters, as you also need to hit the target. I don't believe that we're lacking goalscoring ability, but they were more clinical.
"They caught us in a one-versus-one situation and then scored one wonder goal and then another to make it 3-1. It was an even game and they had a strong central midfield, which made playing inside difficult.
"Their second goal really hurt us. We congratulate them and we will try to improve for the next match."
Barça travels to Madrid for the return leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.
"We have a very unfavourable aggregate score and the opponent is the favourite," Valverde added. "Now we have to play a second leg and things are never over after one defeat, or after one victory.
"When you lose you want another game to come along quickly to try to put things right. We are a little bit taken aback, but we have time to recover our energy."
Barça got a glimpse into life without Neymar following their world-record move to French giants Paris Saint-Germain.
Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele have been tipped to help fill the void at Barça and Valverde said: "We are Barcelona and we want to have the best team. We have time [to sign] until August 31, but I want to evaluate what we already have inside the club."
Kidlapik said many in the hamlet stood on the beach Tuesday night under the midnight sun as Gibbons's body was brought home.
"It's a very big shock," they said.
"There's never been a mauling this serious since I started going out. It's the first mauling that I know of."
Dan Pimentel of Nunavut's Environment Department said the last fatal polar bear mauling was in 2000 near Rankin Inlet, about 200 kilometres up the coast from Arviat.
Pimentel said little information was immediately available as to the bear's condition at the time of the attack.
"That will have to wait until our conservation officers get there and are able to examine the bear. There's only limited information you can get right away as to the health of the bear."
Arviat is considered to be in the range of the Western Hudson Bay polar bear population, estimated in 2016 to number about 840. The Polar Bear Specialist Group, an international body of experts, says that number is stable although it notes declines in body size and condition.
The hunting quota for local bears has steadily increased to 38 this year from 28 in 2016.
The Kivalliq Wildlife Board has said that bear-human encounters are growing.
The Nunavut government and the World Wildlife Fund have co-operated to reduce those conflicts, including steel food storage bins and electric fences around dog team pens. Nunavut is issuing kits containing flares, bear bangers and bear spray to help keep hunters safe.
Western Hudson Bay is estimated to be losing up to five days of sea ice cover per decade. The bears depend on the ice as a hunting platform.
A 2017 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on bear attacks found 73 recorded predatory attacks and 20 fatalities between 1870 and 2014, although that list is likely to be incomplete.
Nearly two-thirds of the attacks were by young adult bears who were starting to starve. Nearly nine in 10 attacks occurred between July and December when the sea ice was at its lowest.

The US State Department said Tuesday it is aware of reports that the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been killed in Malaysia, but declined any further comment.
"We are aware of reports. We refer you to the Malaysian authorities," a department spokesperson told Yonhap News Agency.
(Yonhap)
Kim Jong-nam, the 45-year-old eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who has a different mother from the current leader, was found dead at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday in what was suspected to be an assassination.Reports have said Kim was attacked by two unidentified women with "poisoned needles."A source familiar with the case said that agents of the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's spy agency, have carried out the assassination by taking advantage of a security loophole created between Kim's bodyguards and Malaysian police at the Malaysian airport.

The Mean Green entered the first round of the College Basketball Invitational with, admittedly, little momentum and faced a team who, on paper, looked imposing to head coach Grant McCasland and their team.
North Texas was without their two seniors in Shane Temara and Bryce Jackson and started junior guards Michael Miller and Jorden Duffy, neither of which started a game all season.
The Mean Green played with plenty of energy on the road in South Dakota Wednesday night as they defeated the University of South Dakota 90-77.
“It started on the defensive end, we just guarded personnel really well,” McCasland said. “When you get in postseason, not everyone has seen you. We did a good job of freeing up Rose, good starts from Mike and Duffy and both of them played really well.”
North Texas' offense put up 90 points behind the scoring of three of their starting guards. Miller and Duffy scored 19 each while sophomore Roosevelt Smart dropped in 34 on 10-of-25 shooting from the field and 7-of-18 from 3-point range.
As a team, the Mean Green went 14-of-34 on 3-pointers a stark contrast from the Coyote's 6-of-33 from distance.
“The biggest thing was we overemphasized not letting them get to the basket,” McCasland said. “We were OK with them shooting threes. They do such a good job getting to the free throw line that we couldn't let them get to the basket because that's when they open up what they do on the perimeter.”
Sophomore guard Ryan Woolridge finished with only two points, but had nine assists and only two turnovers in 39 minutes.
While the Mean Green had players step up besides Smart, South Dakota's star Matt Mooney ended the night with 22 points on 8-of-28 shooting from the field and was uncomfortable all night.
“It was just us being in gaps,” Smart said. “[We were] helping whoever was guarding Mooney and making them see five jerseys in front of them and making them kick it out to people who really did not want to shoot it or make other people make plays instead of him.”
Freshman forward Zachary Simmons dominated down low, as they grabbed 17 rebounds and had nine points in 29 minutes.
While sophomore A.J. Lawson only played six minutes and scored two points, the offensive lineup on the court was more suited to play against this defense.
“They are a really good gap defensive team, so they protect the paint well,” McCasland said. “[So] I told A.J. I wanted to put someone out there that gave us a better chance from the 3-point line. Ryan got a lot of paint touches and then Zach in the middle was dominating, they had a heck of a game.”
North Texas' 90 points were the most in regulation since Nov. 11 of 2017 and the team just looked comfortable competing again, against a new team.
McCasland and company will host round two of the CBI tournament on Monday at 7:30 as they look to continue to extend their season.
“This is about North Texas basketball and anytime you can get a team win like that, it's a huge deal.” McCasland said.

PHOENIX — Adam Duvall's grand slam erased an early four-run deficit, and the Cincinnati Reds rallied to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-4 on Wednesday.
Scott Schebler added a tiebreaking two-run drive in the sixth, helping the last-place Reds salvage the finale of the three-game set. Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez each had three hits.
Both of Cincinnati's homers came off Patrick Corbin (5-2), who gave up a season-high six runs and eight hits in six innings.
Paul Goldschmidt and John Ryan Murphy went deep for the Diamondbacks, who have dropped 16 of 20 overall.
Cincinnati right-hander Sal Romano (3-6) pitched five innings in their first win since May 4, yielding four runs and seven hits. They were 0-3 with a 12.79 ERA in their previous three starts.
Raisel Iglesias got four outs for their ninth save in their first appearance since being sidelined by a biceps injury. Pinch hitter Daniel Descalso and Jarrod Dyson singled to start the ninth but Goldschmidt fouled out, Duvall made a sliding grab of Jake Lamb's sinking liner to left and Murphy popped out.
Corbin was cruising with a 4-0 lead when Tucker Barnhart and Votto opened the fourth with singles and Suarez walked on a 3-2 pitch to load the bases. That brought up Duvall, who hit a drive into the seats in left-centre for their second career grand slam.
Suarez opened the sixth with a single, Duvall struck out and Schebler launched a shot 433 feet to right.
It was a disappointing finish for Arizona after a fast start.
Dyson led off the first with a single and Goldschmidt, moved up to second in the batting order in recent games, knocked Romano's 1-1 pitch into the visitor's bullpen for their seventh homer of the season. After Jake Lamb flew out, Murphy doubled to the left-centre gap and scored on David Peralta's single, sliding in just ahead of Billy Hamilton's throw from short centre field.

BCCI President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke sacked by Supreme Court
Both have been removed in a decision taken by the Supreme Court.
@shanky11173 by Shankar Narayan News 02 Jan 2017, 11:43 IST
Ajay Shirke and Anurag Thakur took over in May 2016
What's the story?
In a major decision today, both the President and the Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India – Anurag Thakur and Ajay Shirke – have been removed from their respective positions by the Supreme Court of India.
The apex court has removed Thakur reportedly on the grounds that they lied on their oath and has also served a show-cause notice to them on the issue of perjury. The perjury charges have been labelled on them since the Supreme Court believed that they asked the present Chairman of the International Cricket Council Shashank Manohar for a letter twice and the court felt that this intended to portray the order to be seen by the ICC as government interference.
The apex court will also initiate perjury charges against Thakur.
The larger issue for the removal is the fact that Thakur did not comply with the recommendations made by the Lodha panel, in order to improve the governance of cricket in India.
The court has given Thakur time until the 19th of January to respond to the charges imposed on them by the apex court, until which time, the board will have an observer.
In case you didn't know...
The whole matter took birth during the last phase of the 2013 Indian Premier League when three Rajasthan Royals players- S Sreesanth, Ajit Chandila and Ankit Chavan- were alleged to have been involved in spot-fixing. Later in the year, Sreesanth and Chavan were banned for life while no ruling was made on Chandila.
The Supreme Court of India appointed Justice Mukul Mudgal to examine claims of irregularities in the BCCI and the IPL. In the June 2015, the apex court appointed a three-member panel, consisting of former Chief Justice of India, RM Lodha and retired Supreme Court Judges-Ashok Bhan and R Raveendran- to recommend reforms for cricket in India and determine punishments for those accused by the Mudgal Committee.
You can read the entire timeline of the saga here.
The heart of the matter
Thakur has been under severe pressure on not implementing the Lodha Panel recommendations completely, stating that they could not comply with all the points given by the panel and hence, now they were left with no option but to take such a drastic step.
When contacted, Mr. Shirke said that they had not received any court order yet and did not want to dwell further into the matter.
“I have not got any court order copy, do not want to speak on it,” Mr. Shirke told News18, following the decision.
They further told NDTV that if the Supreme Court have indeed removed them the post of the Secretary, then they were fine with the call and wished that whoever takes over, runs the board well.
“If SC has asked me to leave, that's fine. I hope the new administration runs BCCI well,” they told NDTV.
“I don't regret anything. I don't have any personal ambitions,” they added.
The Supreme Court further added that the BCCI, as well as state boards had failed to implement its order to bring more transparency and accountability in its working.
Reacting to this bit of news, Justice RM Lodha, who had been appointed the head of the panel, also consisting of retired Supreme Court judges Ashok Bhan and R Raveendran, said that this was bound to happen sooner or later and added that they had submitted 3 reports and yet there was no change to be seen.
“This was to happen, and now this has happened. Had submitted 3 reports before Supreme court, even then it wasn't implemented,” Mr.Lodha said.
What's next?
The Supreme Court have decided to appoint an observer for the next fortnight and until then, the senior most vice-president of the BCCI will oversee operations. The elected vice-president will need to give an undertaking that they would abide by the recommendations of the Lodha Panel.
The names of current President of the Cricket Association of Bengal Sourav Ganguly and current President of the Karnataka State Cricket Association Brijesh Patel are doing the rounds as replacements for Thakur for the top post of the BCCI.
Sportskeeda's take
A final verdict on this whole matter was to come out at some point and it might have been best suited for the BCCI that Anurag Thakur had complied with the Lodha recommendations rather than get caught on the receiving end of the Supremer Court ruling in this manner.
While Anurag Thakur and the BCCI did have their own views over certain points in the Lodha recommendations, it would have helped the cause of cricket in India had they acknowledged that the Lodha panel intended to drive greater transparency and governance in the BCCI.
Another error that Anurag Thakur made was to challenge the Supreme Court, which has a renowned history of delivering some significant verdicts. To confront them constantly in the manner that they did, was not the smartest of ideas. Also, they could have found an alternate route to ensure that the BCCI came somewhere close to being on the same page as the recommendations.
It also remains to be seen if these decisions taken today will have any bearing on the on-field action that resumes in a couple of weeks' time. India takes on England in the three-match ODI and T20I series at home.

Elle and Andy are fighting for relationship survival in new reality show Make Or Break .
They are one of eight couples who have headed off to a Mexican tropical paradise to see if their relationship is worth fighting for.
They will then decide if they are with 'The One' in Channel 5's brand-new series Make or Break.
Is what they have worth fighting for? Here's what the couple have to say:
ELLE, 24, MANCHESTER
(Image: Ray Burmiston/Channel 5)
Legal Support Worker
Elle has been with Andy for 4 years
Andy has cheated on Elle 30 times, can they change their ways?
Describe your partner in three words...
Clever, wild and stubborn.
Who said I love you first?
Him! I tried to finish with them and they were like, ‘You can't finish with me I love you!' They were very much whipped at first.
What are Andy's best points?
 They are funny, spontaneous and caring.
What are Andy's bad points?
The loyalty, the stubbornness and being too much of a lad, wanting to show off all the time, that is annoying.
Why did you want to go on the show?
(Image: Publicity Picture)
To make our relationship stronger and just to have a new experience together. We had had a lot of issues in the past, so I thought that going on there would bind us closer after all this rubbish.
What issues did you want to iron out in your relationship?
Andy had been at uni throughout most of our relationship and they had cheated quite a lot because they were in a situation with the lads, getting drunk all the time. There was a lot of cheating, so it was basically the trust.
What did you think when you saw where you'd be staying?
When we first got there I thought, ‘Oh my God, this is a dream'. I have never been anywhere out of Europe so it was like absolute luxury. It was like paradise.

What was going through your mind when Paul told you what was happening?
You go from being in absolute paradise to suddenly being in hell in a matter of three minutes. When we were told what would happen, that was possibly the worst thing that I could have heard. Because of what had happened in the past, I had gone there trying to build trust but how are we going to build trust when he's going to be sharing with other girls? It wasn't good for me at all. We spoke about outcomes before we went and that was the worst possible one I could have thought of and it happened.
Did you think you'd last the distance on the show?
No. There were so many times I said I wanted to leave, I had lost count. It was like the running joke - ‘Oh, Elle is going again!'
And what about Louise the sex therapist?
They were amazing. They helped us so much. They were great. One of the main reasons I wanted to stay was to keep going back to them

Student
Andy blames the lad culture at university for them cheating on Elle
Can they change theirs was and stay faithful?
Describe your partner in three words...
Gorgeous, fiery and funny.
How did you meet?
I met Elle at a fancy dress party. They were dressed as Princess Jasmine. I met them there and we started texting a little bit and we ended up getting together.
Who said I love you first?
Me. It was quite early as well, only five weeks in. We had an argument and they finished with me and I said, ‘No you can't because I love you!'
What are Elle's best points?
 They are really kind, they are a really empathetic person.  They are obviously very forgiving. I think they are funny. When they want to be relaxed we have a very good time together, when she's not getting irate.
What are Elle's bad points?
They are sort of my fault, but the trust issues are a bad point.  They are a really fiery person and when they go they just goes. They can't contain herself. I think that is why we clash a lot.

Why did you want to go on the show?
I think it was Elle who signed up for the show and I just went along with it. I quite fancied doing the telly and I've always thought I was the right sort of person for it.
What issues did you want to iron out in your relationship?
There were massive trust issues because I had cheated on them quite a lot in the past. I had stopped doing that but they never really believed it. They would always bring up the past and they never believed that I had stopped so we went on to sort that out.
Did you set any ground rules before arriving?
Once we found out what was going on they started setting the rules in place, saying, ‘You'd better not sleep in the bed' and things like that.
What was going through your mind when Paul told you what would be happening?
Me and Elle had spoken before saying what was the worst scenario going to be and we'd thought, ‘Well, we might have to date each other'. Then when they said that I just knew it wouldn't end well!
And what about Louise the sex therapist?
I went into the therapy sessions thinking they were going to be a load of rubbish, but they were really good. I took everything they said on board and when I left the show I was really focusing on how to make it work with everything they said.

Russia's first top golfer has been arrested on charges over allegedly murdering and beheading their mother with a kitchen knife after a row with their wife.
Artem Nesterov decapitated mum Lyudmila, 66, then fled by car, crashing three times into fences, police have alleged.
They called their wife, their sister Lydia, 30, and the police to report the gruesome killing, said law enforcement sources.
The 37-year-old golfer was detained the day after they allegedly murdered their mum, according to police.
They will be held for two months as investigations continue, ruled Shcherbinsky district court of Moscow.

The body with a severed head nearby was found by police in a detached house in Yerino village, near Moscow.
They had suffered multiple wounds including to their abdomen.
It later emerged that the frenzied attack came after the golfer had a row with their wife, who complained to them about the amount of time they spent at work.
(Image: Will Stewart)
The couple have a one and a half year old child.
After the row, Nesterov left to visit their mother - a former tourist guide and interpreter - saying they could "comfort him".
In 2003, Nesterov was the first Russian golfer to be awarded the title of master of sports.
They were also a Russian champion in a sport that was only introduced to the country after the fall of communist rule in 1991.
The sportsman had been working as a coach for ten years.

Law enforcement officials said Nesterov had confessed to the "intentional murder" of their mother, and was charged accordingly.
"Shcherbinsky District Court of Moscow has put the defendant in custody for two months charged with the murder of a woman born in 1951," said a judicial source cited by RBC news agency.
Nesterov and their wife only wed recently but had been living together for more than a decade.
After the row, they had threatened them with divorce, it was reported.
They said previously of their career: "I got into golf thanks to my uncle who took me to classes at Moscow City Golf Club.
(Image: Will Stewart)
"In 2002 I won the Cup of Russia, and in 2003 became Russia's first master of sports in golf.
"The two following seasons I was training in America with Robert Baker, one of the most renowned teachers of modern times, one of the top-100 golf gurus of the US....
"I worked as their assistant for two years being their student at the same time."
In 2005, they moved to South Africa where they " lived, trained and participated in competitions in Cape Town".

NEW YORK (AP) — Rumor the German shepherd has become America's top dog.
Cheered loudly all around the ring by a packed crowd at Madison Square Garden, Rumor was picked as best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club on Tuesday night.
Rumor became just the second German shepherd to win the nation's most prestigious pooch parade, joining the fittingly named Manhattan in 1987. Rumor retired after a near-miss at Westminster last year, but they returned a month ago to give it another try.
The 5-year-old Rumor is named for the Adele hit song "Rumor Has It." This was the 104th career win for Rumor, and handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said earlier in the day that this would definitely, for real, be their last major show.
There were nearly 2,800 dogs entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition, spread across the 202 eligible breeds and varieties.
Rumor beat out a Norwegian elkhound, a Pekingese, a miniature poodle, an Irish setter, a boxer and a Norwich terrier in the final ring.
Micro-influencers, chatbots and mobile marketing are all trends you should be diving into, to connect when everyone's at the beach.
May 30, 2018 5 min read
If you're the founder of an ecommerce business, you need to always be on the lookout for new trends. New trends alert you to new strategies and technologies you can adopt, in order to stay ahead of the competition and sustain business growth.
Whether you're a SaaS business or an online store, you need different marketing strategies at different seasons of the year, to better serve your customers. The season we're now in (unofficially, following Memorial Day) is, of course, summer. And summer requires extra effort because people spend more time outside, meaning you'll need to put extra effort into getting, and keeping, their attention.
Related: 3 Strategies for Ecommerce Sales and Growth Using the New Technologies
So, start your summer marketing strategy by updating yourself on the current trends in ecommerce. Here are several important trends to help define your ecommerce business growth during the hot months:
The rise of micro-influencer marketing
People always hesitate to spend money on a product they've never heard of. This is the main reason why direct marketing often fails. People don't realize the usefulness of a product until it's shown to them; this applies especially to millennials. That's why influencer marketing works wonders.
According to a survey described in Medium, 30 percent of consumers polled said they were more likely to buy a product recommended by a blogger. They said they actually valued those bloggers' opinions more than the those of celebrities.
Leveraging these micro and niche influencers and bloggers is the latest trend in ecommerce marketing. It's much easier and more cost-effective than traditional onlinemarketing techniques.
Tip: team up with some of those micro-influencers in your niche this season to promote your products more effectively.
Email marketing delivers better conversions.
If you've been growing an email list for your ecommerce business, now is the time to cash in on that investment. When it comes to driving conversions, there's no better marketing channel than email.
Surveys reported in Search Engine Journal showed that 66 percent of consumers polled had made a purchase based on an email marketing message. That's more than twice the conversion rate of all the social media platforms combined.

Tip: Create a special seasonal email marketing campaign to target your potential customers via promotional emails about things like summer sales. Create a product catalog, offer discounts and upsell your existing customers via special promotions.
The majority of customers use mobile devices.
Summer is a season when most people spend their time away from work camping or going on beach trips. They'll be using their phones more than ever to upload their selfies on Instagram and snap their best moments on SnapChat.
The number of people who shop while on social networks is on the rise. And, here, Facebook is still taking the lead in terms of social commerce: Statistics reported in Marketing Week showed that 33 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed preferred to buy products directly from Facebook.
Tip: Create a marketing budget to run a social media promotional campaign this season. Maybe even double-down on your efforts by using your email-list segments to run a retargeting ad campaign using Facebook Ads.
More customers now use voice search.
With more virtual assistant-powered devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home taking over households around the globe, it's important that you build an SEO strategy aimed at improving your website, blog and product pages, by optimizing for voice search.
By 2020, according to ComCore, 50 percent of all searches will be voice search. That future is not too far away. In fact, according to the SmartAudio Report, 1 in 6 Americans (16 percent) already own a voice-activated smart speaker.
Tip: Start optimizing your product pages and descriptions for voice search. Instead of using keywords, start using search phrases to target people's voice commands, questions and searches.
Bots provide better customer service.
Providing responsive and better customer support is another important part of a business that you need to tackle, not just during the hectic times of year but also almost every day. Just a few minutes of delay in your response to a customer question could lead to a big loss of sales and revenue.
Utilizing chatbots may be your best solution. Contrary to popular belief, bots actually provide better customer service than human customer-service representatives, according to some industry observers. The reason is that they allow you to give instant responses to customer questions 24/7, at minimal cost.
According to research found by the blog Invesp, 40 percent of people in one survey said they didn't care whether they got help from a chatbot (vs. a human), as long as they received the help they needed. As a business owner, you can actually utilize a bot to take care of 80 percent of your customer engagements.
Tip: Think of all the money you could save and the sales you could generate by providing better service to your potential customers via chatbots.
Conclusion
Following the trends is important. But, providing a better customer experience is what you should really be focusing on.

While the traditional stat line for Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa and outside linebacker Melvin Ingram wouldn't cause anyone to take a second glance, each posted a dominant quarterback-pressure-ratio in their limited action.
According to Pro Football Focus, Bosa netted two quarterback pressures in their five pass rush snap opportunities. Meanwhile, Ingram pressured the quarterback on exactly one-third of their opportunities.
The #Chargers have a pair of pass rushing studs, and they showed it in their preseason opener cameos: pic.twitter.com/HsRi3oU9II — Pro Football Focus (@PFF) August 14, 2017
NFL Media's Alex Flanagan recently discovered that Bosa's dislocated finger is still, in fact, dislocated.
And they again reported the news during NFL Network's telecast Sunday night shortly after Bosa left the field after appearing to bang up their elbow.
Los Angeles has understandably kept Bosa off the field since they trotted tot they sideline favoring one of their wings. However, both they and Ingram played enough to give plenty of NFL quarterbacks something to think about moving forward.
For the record: Ingram finished with one tackle and Bosa with two.

Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson admitted that they were disappointed with the manner of their side's defeat on Friday evening.
The Robins were beaten by Sammy Ameobi's long range goal in the 71st minute and couldn't find a way back into the game at the Macron Stadium.
After the match, the Bristol Post asked Johnson why Famara Diedhiou had been withdrawn and Bobby Reid was kept so deep, despite the away side being in a losing position and needing goals.
"I didn't think they looked like they were going to score. Simple," said Johnson.
"I had to make the change to give somebody else a go. I thought Famara was outstanding in the last game [against QPR] but unfortunately they couldn't quite live up to those heights today.
"Sometimes as a striker it's about the service. Getting in early service into you and yeah he's obviously still coming back to fitness don't forget.
"And maybe the game sort of kept up with them a little bit. But we weren't dangerous enough - not just fam but all around the pitch," explained Johnson.
Johnson withdrew Jamie Paterson as well as Diedhiou, and shifted Reid backwards into central midfield meaning the Robins lost their three top scorers (Flint apart) in the league this season despite needing a goal in the latter stages.
The Post asked if Reid could have been pushed into attack.
"Well, obviously we made the shape change. And what I wanted was as many potential goalscorers or attacking players on the pitch as possible.
"Obviously we played with a holding midfielder and two no.10s if you like, with Bobby and Ryan Kent.
"But it's difficult sometimes, and when they score they get 11 faces beind the ball very quickly and they did it very well.
"And it's difficult to break through their lines. Therefore people want to get on the ball so they drop a little deeper and there lies the issue. It wasn't a stretched out game at all, it was a 'we'll get it and Bolton will get back behind the ball' game.
"On the day we weren't good enough to break them down," admitted Johnson.
Bristol City play Sunderland at home next and will look to rejuvenate their promotion hopes with a win.
Sending children off to college or into the real world is usually a proud time for parents. But there also can be sadness, especially when it's the last child to leave home. Empty nest syndrome isn't a clinical diagnosis. Instead, it's a phenomenon in which parents experience feelings of sadness and loss when the last child leaves home.
"It's common for parents to find letting go to be a painful experience — even though they actively encourage their children to be independent," says Dr. Jessica Sosso, Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic Health System. "Parents might find it difficult to suddenly have no children at home who need their care. They might miss being a part of their children's daily lives and their constant companionship. Parents with only one child or those who strongly identify with their role as a parent might have a particularly difficult time adjusting."
Sosso explains that as hard as the change may be, having an empty nest can bring benefits to parents. Recent studies suggest that an empty nest might reduce work and family conflicts. Having an empty nest also gives parents a new opportunity to reconnect with each other, improve the quality of their marriage and rekindle interests for which they previously might not have had time.
If you're experiencing feelings of loss due to empty nest syndrome, Sosso suggests these tips:

International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) has launched a facility to commercially produce Fruitfly Mania, a fruitfly protein bait as a way of addressing the fruit fly challenge in Africa.
The facility has been constructed through a public-private-sector partnership between Icipe and Kenya Biologics Ltd, on the latter's premises in Makuyu, Murang'a county. It has a production capacity of 2,000 litres per day. “Currently, there is high demand for protein food baits in Kenya, but there is no local producer of the products.
This means that protein baits have to be imported and retailed at exorbitant prices, which makes them unaffordable to smallholder growers,” says Dr Sunday Ekesi, Interim Director of Research and Partnerships and Head, African Fruit Fly Programme at Icipe.
The bait will retail at 70 per cent less the cost of other commercially available products. An additional 400,000 mango growers will benefit from Fruitfly Mania, once the product is registered across East Africa.
Icipe Director General and Chief Executive Officer, Dr Segenet Kelemu, said the centre's aim is to reduce yield losses and the huge expenditure incurred by growers purchasing synthetic pesticides. It will also contribute towards reducing the health and environmental risks associated with the use and misuse of such chemicals.
“We firmly believe that the product alongside the centre's other fruity fly integrated pest management packages, presents strong possibilities for achieving these goals. This outcome will improve the health of people, animals and the environment, and also increase the global competitiveness of fruits from Africa,” they said.
Fruit flies are devastating pests of fruits and vegetables, which are estimated to cause losses amounting to millions of dollars through direct damage to produce, and indirectly due to loss of market opportunities, as the presence of these pests leads to the rejection of horticultural products from Africa in export markets.

The mystery of who stole the heist money continues to rumble on - but EastEnders has dropped it's biggest hint yet as to the culprit.
The dramatic storyline has been full of twists and turns since Walford's wannabe gangsters held up a van full of cash and jewels.
Shifty Aidan and their motley crew are desperate to get their hands on the money and find out which one sold them out.
But in a shock twist, there was a massive clue that Phil and Sharon Mitchell were responsible.
(Image: BBC)
(Image: BBC)
The couple appeared to implicate themselves in the mystery of the missing cash - but were unaware that Mel Owen heard everything.
After brutally kidnapping and interrogating Mick Carter, furious Vincent Hubbard accused Phil of helping son Ben take the cash.
Phil denied their son was involved and urged Aidan to stay away from the Square for a while so they can work on Mel.
(Image: BBC)
(Image: BBC)
Sharon burst into the Arches, looking panicked, and asked to know what was going on.
Reassuring her, Phil said: "Aidan got the wrong end of the stick that Mick had their money."
Sharon asked: "But they don't think that now?"
Phil used the fact that Mick was "still walking" as evidence, but Sharon wanted to know who Aidan suspects.
(Image: BBC)
Phil said: "Well lets hope they don't find out - because it will be a bloodbath."
The Mitchells forgot that private conversations should be had behind closed doors - especially in Walford.
Sneaky Mel was listening around the corner, but what will they do with their newfound information?

Mississippi's governor has signed the nation's tightest abortion restrictions into law.Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed House Bill 1510 on Monday afternoon. It becomes law immediately and bans most abortions after 15 weeks' gestation. Bryant has frequently said they want Mississippi to be the "safest place in America for an unborn child."The law's only exceptions are if a fetus has health problems making it "incompatible with life" outside of the womb at full term, or if a pregnant woman's life or a "major bodily function" is threatened by pregnancy. Pregnancies resulting from rape and incest aren't exempted.Abortion rights advocates are calling the law unconstitutional because it limits abortion before fetuses can live outside the womb. The owner of Mississippi's only abortion clinic opposes the law and has pledged to sue.

A YEAR after meningococcal disease killed their mate, Steven Vincent is begging teenagers to get vaccinated before the State Government's free program expires at the end of the year.
Steven had just clocked on at work on October 21 last year when they got a text message from Mathieu Iacopetta's father, Barry, that shattered their world.
Mat, a friend and long-time colleague at Broadway Pizza, was dead. They had succumbed to Y-strain meningococcal disease after a week in intensive care, during which their limbs had been amputated in a last-ditch effort to save their lives.
“I was shocked. Never in a million years would I have thought Mat would pass away from meningococcal — I didn't even know what it was at that point,” Steven said.
It is not known how Mat contracted the disease, but their parents suspect they may have come in contact with a carrier of the bacteria at an Oktoberfest party.
Meningococcal bacteria live harmlessly in the throats and noses of about 20 per cent of the population, but can become deadly in the rare cases when it invades the bloodstream.
Before their death, Mat worked alongside Steven for four years, the pair quickly bonding over a shared love of the Fremantle Dockers and the fact they both attended John XXIII College.
After researching meningococcal and finding vaccinations were available but could cost in excess of $100, Steven last year launched an online petition calling on the State Government to subsidise the injections.
“It was too late to help my friend but not too late to help others,” they said.
Camera Icon Steven Vincent's good mate Mathieu Iacopetta died of meningococcal disease last year. Picture: Supplied
Before Steven even reached their goal of 1000 signatures the State Government introduced a free meningococcal vaccination program for people aged 15-19.
Since then, about 60 per cent of students in Years 10-12 have received the potentially life-saving jab at their school — but that drops to 15 per cent of 18-year-olds and just 10 per cent of 19-year-olds.
Steven, who has been vaccinated, encouraged all eligible teenagers to book an appointment with their GP to receive the vaccine before the end of December.
“It might take you half an hour, but could potentially save you, your mates and your family from a terrible disease, and one that is on the rise,” they said.
There has been a spike in cases, with 41 confirmed victims and five deaths this year.
The free vaccine is available from any GP and guards against the A, C, W and Y strains. The State vaccination initiative will be a school-only program from 2018.
The pitches frequently appeal to aspiring small investors such as Walter Xu, a recent university graduate who was drawn to Qianbao by promises of sky-high returns. Qianbao looked like a real business: Its portal sold cellphones and appliances — with discounts for members — as well as big returns for those who gave it money. In exchange for depositing money, watching ads and writing reviews, it offered returns of as much as 50 per cent. In all, Xu invested $32,000 of their savings in Qianbao.
Online investing in China isn't for the vulnerable or the naive — but frequently, that's exactly who it draws. The flameout last week of the popular online investment portal Qianbao is the latest in a string of collapses that has devastated small investors and prompted Beijing to take steps to tamp down on potential unrest.
Now as much as $5 billion (U.S.) is missing, the head of the company is in jail and in one city, angry investors took to the streets.
To investors, it seemed like a safe bet. For years, it was. Then some of them tried to take their money out.
SHANGHAI—The company's name appeared in ads for the local marathon. Its logo was emblazoned on the jerseys of two professional soccer teams in Spain. Its founder had been lauded by the government's official television channel.
Some investors who lost their savings in Qianbao protested last week in Nanjing, where the online investment platform had been based. Police acted swiftly, detaining the organizers of the demonstration and giving others warnings, according to a notice by Nanjing police. Government censors appeared to have taken down some discussions about Qianbao on social media and removed some news articles about it.
Now, they said, they must put the episode behind him. “I need to work and start over,” they said.
On Dec. 26, when Qianbao's founder turned themselves over to authorities, Xu turned to fellow investors on WeChat, China's popular social messaging platform, to commiserate. “I talked until 3 in the morning,” they said. “I was shocked.”
China has been rife with investment frauds in the decades since its economic reopening led to a boom. But online versions have the potential to reach more people in a country with more than 700 million internet users, many of whom now conduct most of their financial transactions on smartphones.
Investors in online products are often drawn by promises of high rates of return and the idea that the investments are safer than China's stock market, which long has had a reputation for casino-like uncertainty. But they are often unsophisticated investors who are unaware of the risks, experts warn.
“If you are earning 10 or 11 per cent on an investment product, you should know that you are taking on a high amount of risk,” said Michael Pettis, professor of finance at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University and a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
“It's not clear to me that investors understand that they are taking on this risk,” they added.
In some instances, Qianbao promised investors returns as high as 80 per cent. Such promises are easy to come by in China.
Conglomerates and fly-by-night companies alike have turned to new online platforms to raise money if they can't get credit from banks. Often the pitches are long on promises but short on accountability.
Just four months ago, a Beijing court handed down a lifetime prison sentence to the founder of a $9-billion online lending platform called Ezubao that authorities now say had been a Ponzi scheme. Last summer, Chinese police arrested the head of Fanya Metals Exchange, which offered investment products promising double-digit returns, after it lost $6 billion of investor money. One month later, investors in a company called Shanxinhui lost billions of dollars and many hundreds of protesters took to the streets. In response to protests in Beijing at the time, Guo Shengkun, then China's police chief, pledged to rein in fraudulent financial schemes.
In a country where everything is tightly managed by the government, many investors believe the government will take steps to make sure investors get their money if something goes wrong.
“The big difference between China and U.S. consumer finance is the Chinese have implicit faith that someone in government will step in if any products or companies default,” said Andrew Collier, founder of research firm Orient Capital Research.
Qianbao — whose name translates to money treasure — possessed a veneer of credibility. Local officials attended its events. It sponsored the Nanjing Marathon and two Spanish soccer teams, Real Sociedad and Rayo Vallecano. Qianbao's founder, Zhang Xiaolei, was even profiled by China Central Television, the government's official broadcaster, the ultimate sign of success.
Over its six years, Qianbao collected money from as many as 200 million users who deposited their money into the website, raising $5 billion in deposits, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. In order to earn interest on their deposits, investors were told they had to participate in promotional activities such as watching ads, posting information about various products on social media and filling out questionnaires. The website also provided a platform for retailers for their products, which members could buy.
Then its founder turned themselves in, with state-run media saying they took the step after the company drew attention from officials. Zhang and their company are being investigated by authorities in Nanjing.
“I have taken in money from new investors to pay old investors,” Zhang said in a handwritten statement published by Nanjing police.
“I cannot pay back the principal and interest and I am very sorry about the loss to investors,” they added. An email to the company's public relations officials seeking comment bounced back unanswered.
More recently, when Zhang was interviewed by a local television network, they said they had spent three years preparing for the day that they would turn themselves in. “I need to take legal responsibility,” they said.
Kimi Wang, who watched the protests in Nanjing from a nearby government building, said they had deposited about $79,000 into Qianbao. All of it, they said, was gone.
Many investors in Qianbao were told that the more money they put in, the higher the returns would be. Wang borrowed from an online cash lender and friends in order to add to their investment. It was the equivalent of seven or eight years of income for Wang, who does odd jobs like drive for the ride-sharing company Didi Chuxing.
The damage, they said, is widespread. “Every Nanjing local has a relative or friend that used Qianbao,” they said.
Muslims staying up to pray as part of their religion helped to save lives during the London Grenfell Tower block tragedy.
One woman's passionate account of the part Muslims played in raising the alarm and helping to save lives during the blaze, in which at least 12 people died, has gone viral on social media.
Those of Muslim faith are currently observing Ramadan, and Muslims were coming home from Taraweeh prayers at a Mosque or waking up for Suhoor, which is a pre-fast meal, when the blaze broke out, according to several reports from those involved in the incident. If it wasn't for the religious practices being observed, they wouldn't have been awake in the early hours of the morning when the blaze broke out.
Watch the video here.
Throughout the day, hundreds of concerned local people, without anyone asking, have turned out to help since Grenfell Tower was engulfed in flames.
The Maxilla Social Club has been turned into an impromptu donation drop-in centre since 2am.
It has been flooded with people taking clothes, bedding and food. Some residents just showed up and said "do you need a hand, I have not brought anything but I can offer my time and help".
Joe Walsh, who runs the Maxilla Social Club, said that volunteers had been on hand collecting donations, making cups of tea and been available for a chat since 2am.
They said these included youngsters who stopped to go and sit their A-level exams before rushing back to help.
Mr Walsh said: "We have been here since 2am and we will probably be here all night.
"We have accepted food and clothing. The only thing we are not accepting is cash. We are sending them to the Christian centre for that.
"It has been the community who did all this.
"I am only surprised by how much the community have helped, but the community have always been good around here."
THIS year we mark a momentous milestone in women's history and equal rights in Britain.
Women finally gained the right to vote and to stand as Members of Parliament a century ago.
Many believed the day would never come. It was a long road and the fight for justice was at times deeply bitter.
But, on February 6, 1918, the Representation of the People Act became law, enabling women over 30 with property to take their rightful place at the ballot box for the first time.
There can be no under-estimating of how this seismic moment changed our history.
Behind the sweeping change stood the proud Suffragettes and Suffragists, whose celebrations were muted at the time, as the Great War still raged in Europe.
While the Suffragists (led by Millicent Fawcett) used constitutional methods, the Suffragettes (led by Emmeline Pankhurst) used actions of civil disobedience to pressurise the government to give women the vote.
The centenary of this achievement allows us all a great opportunity to reflect on the legacy of the suffrage movement.
It is a chance to reflect upon the further changes which are needed to bring about genuine equality for women.
There can be no denying that the last hundred years has seen huge progress in British society.
A series of legislative battles have been fought and won by women MPs: equal guardianship by Nancy Astor and Margaret Wintringham in 1920; family allowances by Eleanor Rathbone in 1945; equal pay by Barbara Castle in 1970; and paid maternity leave by Harriet Harman in 1999.
We have also seen a surge in the number of females reaching the high echelons of politics, science, business and sport.
In a fitting tribute to Fawcett's battle to extend the vote to women, a statue of them will be unveiled in Parliament Square opposite the House of Commons this year.
As the MP for Leeds West, I am proud of the role the city's women played in the great suffrage movement. Leonora Cohen, who was born in Hunslet and lived in Leeds for most of their life, acted as a bodyguard for Emmeline Pankhurst and became known as the ‘Tower Suffragette' after having smashed the display case of the British Crown Jewels in the Tower of London in 1913. A blue plaque is on display at their old home near Leeds University.
Bramley's Mary Gawthorpe and Headingley's Isabella Ford were actively involved in the fight to get the vote for women.
However, the first general election in which women were allowed to vote in 1918 saw just one woman elected – Constance Markiewicz, a fiery revolutionary socialist from Sinn Féin who refused to take their seat in line with their party's policy.
The Commons had to wait until the Plymouth Sutton by-election in 1919 for the first woman MP to take their seat – Lady Nancy Astor, an American-born society hostess whose husband had been the MP for the seat before being elevated to the House of Lords.
Women MPs were continually undermined in parliament both politically and physically in the years that followed. When trying to get to their seat in the chamber, Conservative MP Nancy Astor was physically intimidated and blocked by male colleagues. As Labour MP Edith Summerskill described, Parliament felt ‘like a boys' school which had decided to take a few girls'.
In my biography of Alice Bacon, the first female MP in Leeds in 1945 and the joint first in Yorkshire along with Muriel Nichol in Bradford South, I wrote about some of the challenges they faced. It took another 65 years before I was elected as only the second female MP to represent the city.
My election and the growing number of female MPs in Parliament is down to the amazing work of Harriet Harman and women like them who have simply refused to give up fighting for women's rights.
In 1918, it would have been inconceivable for a woman MP to become Prime Minister. Now, we have had two women Prime Ministers. Hopefully, we will be able to add a female Labour PM to their ranks before too long.
The total number of women MPs at Westminster now stands at 208 out of 650 MPs. When Harriet Harman was first elected in 1982, there were only 10 female Labour MPs and just one from Yorkshire.
However, in the 2017 general election, the number of Yorkshire women surged so that 20 out of 37 of Yorkshire's Labour MPs are now women. That is a great record and one of which I am proud.
Yorkshire is also making its mark with more women council leaders proportionately than the rest of the UK – with Judith Blake in Leeds, Susan Hinchcliffe in Bradford, Julie Dore in Sheffield and Ros Jones as Executive Mayor in Doncaster.
But there is still much more work to be done to ensure there is real equality, fairness and justice for women.
I was shocked at the blatant injustice of the gender pay gap at the BBC.
Then, there was the disgraceful behaviour towards young female workers that the Financial Times uncovered at the men-only Presidents Club dinner at a Mayfair hotel – revealing the appalling sexism that is apparently still prevalent in parts of the City.
At present, more than two-thirds of Westminster's MPs are men. That's hardly representative of women who make up half the population.
Let us rightly celebrate the first British women who risked their lives and freedom to get the vote.
But let us remember that our fight for equality goes on. Women who still face discrimination and unfair treatment in every walk of life should never stop fighting until the days comes when we can all enjoy genuine equality and justice.

Here's what you don't do when you're opening a new restaurant – lead all of your PR and marketing with “we've spent a million quid on this place!” You instantly position yourself in potential punters' minds as the restaurant that needs to make a million quid back before it's in profit. They consequently assume you are skimping on ingredients or staff pay, and resent and question every penny they hand over to you. It's a basic error that Tapasya has made. Repeatedly. For months.
It's a shame, as well, because Tapasya's new second location on Hull's continually-blooming marina (they've had a place in another, less-trendy part of the city for a couple of years now) is an attractive affair. Lovely and clean, lots of shiny glass and comfy cushions etc. And the food is very good indeed.
This restaurant is the last of the big new Fruit Market eateries opening ahead of Hull's City of Culture year and it's a welcome addition. After all, who doesn't love a good curry? Hold your horses, though, because Tapasya isn't your average local curry house, it offers Indian fine dining. It's posh and wants you to know. So posh that they even offer High Tea.
In a wonderfully original move, Tapasya has taken some well-worn classic side dishes, added a few less familiar ones, bunged them on a three-tier cake-stand and turned it into a delightful lunchtime treat. There are deep-fried tiger prawns, lamb patties, crisp fried cottage cheese, pea and potato fritters and (best of all) a grilled chicken, cheese and onion sandwich. There are a couple of chutney dips (tamarind and a delicious mint one) and then three traditional pastries on the top layer. It's all served with a pot of tea for £12.50 or an additional glass of champagne for another £6. It's lovely stuff and just the sort of thing that should have lunchtime diners racing in.
They are also offering a less successful all-on-one-plate lunch menu. It costs just a tenner and apparently uses local ingredients, but these are the only positives. The best way to describe it is as a deconstructed mini tiffin box, with one choice from three of starters, main and dessert and one side. They're all served in little dishes on one platter. There's stuff like fish amitsari (plaice fillet with green pea mash and lemon yogurt) and rajasthani lal maans, which is diced lamb with spices. Sadly, there isn't enough of each dish to properly get to grips with and it all feels like you're being offered canapés left over from a do. I think you'd feel underwhelmed if you had just this for lunch.
Away from the lunch menu, the evening menu is something of a triumph. There are a couple of traditional curry dishes – like pork vindaloo – for the less adventurous, but there are more intriguing options that you really should try. Starters – or “light courses” as they're called on the menu – like crispy kekda (soft shell crab, £6.95) are excellent. Served on a papaya salad with kumquat chutney, the crab is perfectly cooked and very tasty. The scallops (£8.95) served with pineapple chutney are sadly overpowered by other flavours on the plate so, while the mustard mooli and caramelised pineapple are great, the dish needs a little rejigging so the scallops can find a space.
In the mains I can heartily recommend the hiran ki sikar (£18.95), which is the juiciest, softest venison I've had for a very long time. It's served with a sort of butternut squash risotto, a jus and some rather delicious quenelles of parsnip puree.
Desserts (all £4.50) include a perfectly excellent gajjar halwa (who doesn't like a sweet carroty pud?) and a garam masala-infused chocolate fondant, which I've had served both perfectly oozy and disappointingly cooked-through. Some quality control still required there.
There are a couple of other minor gripes to clear up; the service, as with Tapasya the first, continues to be over-intrusive. Too many staff members flitting and interrupting for no reason. It may be well-meaning but it gets seriously aggravating. And the £1m spent on the restaurant clearly didn't stretch to the flooring. It's very unsure and wobbly. Every time one of the over-fussing waiting staff steps near your table, the whole thing tips noticeably.
And it's that sort of thing that harks back to the point of not banging on about what the restaurant cost to build. Every critical decision every diner will make for the foreseeable future will relate to money. Sadly, Tapasya @ Marina is now positioned as the posh curry house that cost a fortune to build. But the food, drink and welcome are more than good enough for people to see beyond the stupidly-vaunted price tag and I truly hope they do.

Three people face 17 felony charges of kidnapping after a video surfaced online showing police arresting one of them.The Los Angeles County District Attorney charged Amber Neal, Keith Andre Stewart and Johntae Jones with kidnapping actors Daisy McCrackin, 36, and Joseph Capone on May 3, 2017 in South Los Angeles. Other charges include assault with a firearm, grand theft, mayhem, conspiracy and possession for sale of a controlled substance.McCrackin, who has appeared in movies such as "Halloween Resurrection" and "3000 Miles to Graceland," was taken from a home, along with Capone.The trio reportedly pistol-whipped Capone before driving them and McCrackin to Jones' home in Compton, where they allegedly stripped Capone naked and held them in a bathtub for 30 hours while forcing McCrackin to pay a ransom of at least $10,000.McCrackin took money out of an ATM before being forced to write the kidnappers a check, but was then able to escape two days into the ordeal and call 911."Police and more people came, but we didn't know what happened to her," Esmerelda Delgado said. "She used to bring toys for my kid. They were really friendly. I used to go to their house to clean their house a few times. But, one day we didn't see their anymore."Delgado lives a few doors down from McCrackin. They were friendly with the actor, but hasn't seen them or their dog for a year.The other two suspects were the ones arrested in the video that has gone viral on social medial. In the video, LAPD officers can be seen ordering Neal out of a vehicle at gunpoint in the moments before their arrest.Bail for Jones and Neal is set at $1 million, while Stewart's is more than $2 million. The defendants are expected to appear in court on July 23 for a pretrial hearing.Eyewitness News also learned that famed O.J. Simpson prosecutor Christopher Darden is representing one of the suspects in the case.

South Korean businesses are likely to hire fewer people this year than in 2016 amid the ongoing economic slump, a survey showed Tuesday.
The survey of 258 companies with more than 100 employees conducted by the Korean Employers Federation (KEF) said those polled planned to employ 6.6 percent less this year than last year.

The companies plan to recruit 7.3 percent fewer college graduates and reduce the number of hirees with high school diplomas by 7.9 percent compared to the year before.Of those surveyed, 53.7 percent said they are planning to have new recruits this year.About a quarter (25.3 percent) of those questioned said they have not yet made a decision on whether to hire new employees this year while 21.0 percent said they have no plans to employ new workers.The declining size of new employees was attributed by companies to poor business performance due to the slumping economy (46.6 percent), domestic and global economic uncertainties (21.2 percent) and the extension of the retirement age to 60 (14.0 percent).About 47.3 percent said they will be able to employ more this year if wages are frozen.The companies surveyed preferred to employ fresh recruits (69.1 percent) compared with experienced workers (30.9 percent).The proportion of experienced workers rose 1.6 percent this year from the previous year as they can more easily do their jobs without additional training.

YouTube, Urged By Scotland Yard, Removes Rap Videos Blamed For Violence
Enlarge this image toggle caption Jorg Greuel/Getty Images Jorg Greuel/Getty Images
A title card is the first thing you see in the video for "They Ain't 100," a song by the British rapper Fredo — which reads: Disclaimer: The content in this video is an expression of art and should not be taken literally. K-Trap's "David Blaine" opens with a similar prologue: All characters in this visual are entirely fictional. The events that occur are purley [sic] symbolic and should not be taken literal. The video follows up with an audio repetition of the warning.
The warnings are these rappers' insurance against claims by law enforcement in Britain that their genre of rap, called drill — the popularization of which is largely attributed to the rapper Chief Keef and which was seized on by British youth, driving an explosion in that country — has been a contributing factor in a metastasizing, upward trend of violence there.
"Sadly, I have had to look at quite a lot of drill music," Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick, London's highest-ranking police official, said in an interview on May 18. "You can access it, sadly, very easily ... Very quickly you will see that these are associated with lyrics that are about glamorizing violence — serious violence, murder, stabbings, they describe the stabbings in great detail, with great joy ... But most particularly, it is often — we have gangs who make drill videos and in those videos they taunt each other and say what they're going to do with each other." A "gangs database" established by the Metropolitan Police, which lists among other things the music taste of those in it, was called "deeply flawed" by Amnesty International last month.
Scotland Yard's diagnosis of the genre and the information in that database have now resulted in the removal of several of them from the world's most-used video-streaming platform, YouTube. A YouTube spokesperson confirmed in an email to NPR that videos were removed — over 30, according to the BBC — and clarified in a statement that the removals were done so in collaboration with law enforcement.
"We have a dedicated process for the police to flag videos directly to our teams because we often need specialist context from law enforcement to identify real-life threats. Along with others in the U.K., we share the deep concern about this issue and do not want our platform used to incite violence," a statement from YouTube reads, in part. It also pointed to a policy established in the U.K. 10 years ago, addressing the depiction of weapons in videos uploaded to the site "amid growing concern about knife and gun crime among young people," as the BBC wrote at the time. Two years prior to that — just a year after YouTube launched, and one month prior to its purchase by Google — concern over the depiction of violence in music videos on the platform was being reported.
Opinion on whether the videos themselves cause violence, or are a reflection of the lives being lived under pernicious socioeconomic conditions, appears split. In an op-ed in January, London Mayor Sadiq Khan pointed to budget cuts for public services as driving the problem. Racial disparities around those services are pronounced, especially in the capital. "Ethnicity can be a marker of these circumstances, but it is not a cause," The Guardian's editorial board wrote, starkly, last November.

Encinitas community members had a chance Feb. 11 to have their hand in the upcoming ocean-themed mosaic that will be installed at Moonlight Beach's upcoming new lifeguard tower.
Dozens of residents attended the event at Don Myers Stained Glass in Oceanside to help place thousands of glass pieces on the 8-foot-by-15-foot mosaic, which will be installed on an outside wall of Encinitas' now-under-construction $3 million Marine Safety Center.
The lifeguard tower and the mosaic are expected to be completed in the summer, officials said.
Lisa Shaffer, former Encinitas deputy mayor who was on the council at the time of the tower's approval in 2013, said they believed the facility would be instrumental to the city.
“When I ran for city council, the previous council had chosen not to fund a new lifeguard tower because they were putting all the money toward the Encinitas Community Park,” they said. “I thought the lifeguard tower was really important because more people interact with the city there than any other place.”
Encinitas broke ground on the new center in November. The former lifeguard tower, originally built by lifeguard staff in 1953, was demolished on Oct. 24.
Former mayor Kristin Gaspar said at the ground-breaking event that an upgrade was long overdue as the Center serves as the headquarters for all Encinitas Lifeguard beach operations and first aid services for city beaches that host more than 3.5 million visitors per year and up to 30,000 in a single weekend during the busy summer months.
The Surfing Madonna Oceans project — which puts on the Surfing Madonna Beach Run annually as part of its mission to help raise money for community efforts — donated the mosaic to the city.
In the end, the piece will end up costing the nonprofit group more than $30,000, said Bob Nichols, president of the Surfing Madonna Oceans Project.
“This is a group effort where everybody can put their mark on this mosaic,” Nichols said. “Everybody can feel some sort of attachment to this piece because it's a community project.”
The artwork shows layers of the ocean, from fish and animals below up to surfers at the top.
It is meant to be educational, as well as visually stunning, Nichols said.
“This educates the community on just how fragile our local ecosystem is and how beautiful it is,” they said.
Peggy Sue, the artist who designed the mosaic, said they painted six different scenes before this one was approved last year.
They said they were happy to see this artwork have a purpose, rather than just “sitting on someone's wall.”
“To see my little painting become this great big piece on my favorite beach is an artist's dream come true,” Sue said.
Don Myers, owner of the glass shop, said dozens of people have come in on weekends the last few months to place pieces of glass on the mosaic.
They said they believe the 2,000-pound artwork will have a strong significance in the community.
Council member Joe Mosca, who attended the event with their son, agreed.
Mosca, who was on the Parks and Recreation Commission when the piece was approved, said they were happy to see its progress.
“To kind of see it now, it's so much bigger than I thought,” they said. “The community coming together to put it together exceeds my expectations. You can just imagine generations from now going down to the lifeguard tower and saying, ‘Wow. My mom or dad had a place in putting the glass down.'”

Fire crews are responding to a minor gas leak caused by a vehicle colliding with a gas meter at the rear of the Shuswap Pie Company building at approximately 4:15 p.m. on Feb. 3.
The faint scent of natural gas could be smelled in the air near the damaged meter.
Fortis has been called to fix the damaged gas meter.
More to come.

John Terry has been hailed as the greatest Premier League defender of all time after announcing they will leave Chelsea at the end of the campaign.
The ex-England centre-back has enjoyed an illustrious career for club and country, and they depart Stamford Bridge as a Blues legend.
Former teammate Frank Lampard reckons their pal is the best defender in recent times, but is the 36-year-old really head and shoulders above the rest?
Our reporters give their top pick since the Premier League launched back in 1992.
Hamish Mackay - Ashley Cole
The Premier League has seen some truly exceptional defenders — Tony Adams, Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry — but none with the natural ability of Ashley Cole.
They were the complete defender: a talented athlete genuinely as comfortable attacking down the wing as they were making perfectly-timed last-ditch tackles.
For almost ten years, Cole wasn't just the best full-back in the country, they were the best full-back in the world.
They won two league titles (one without losing a game) and three FA Cups in a free-flowing Arsenal team before moving across London to Chelsea and proving they could thrive in a completely different tactical system. They added another league title and five domestic cups to their tally before tasting success in both the Champions League and Europa League.
Cole can also claim to be the only member of England's 'golden generation' that performed consistently on the international stage. No matter how poor the Three Lions were, Cole always shone.
Having won all there was to win, Cole's motivation dipped in their later career and they left England for Serie A, but they left behind them a record and reputation that marks them out as the Premier League's greatest all round defender.

Jacob Murtagh - Rio Ferdinand
John Stones has earned rave reviews for the way they play the ball from the back - a requirement for any defender hoping to make the grade in the current era.
However, Rio Ferdinand was passing out of defence at a time when others were earning plaudits for their no-nonsense style and sticking their head in where it hurts.
Ferdinand was ahead of their time and would not have looked out of place in any of the top sides around Europe.
Manchester United made Ferdinand the most expensive defender in history when they splashed out £30million for their services back in 2002.
They were worth every penny and enjoyed a trophy-laden spell at Old Trafford.

Try, just for a moment, to forget what you THINK you know about John Terry as a man.
Set aside all the rumours, the nonsense and the villainous reputation that Chelsea's "Captain, Leader, Legend" has garnered over the years… and NOW try and tell me Terry is not the finest defender the Premier League has ever seen.
Rightly or wrong, on these shores, opinions of the former England skipper have never been based purely on their on-pitch performances.
They have made the PFA Team of the Year four times, yet they were part of the FIFA World XI for five straight years in the 2000s.
Away from the British tittle tattle, all the experts saw was a top class defender who loved the very essence of defending.
Aside from a very obvious lack of pace, Terry at their peak had everything . Their heart, desire and stomach for the fight was always immediately apparent, but they could pass - off both feet - and their reading of the game was so exceptional, the fact milk occasionally tuned quicker simply didn't matter.
I sincerely doubt any other defender has more regularly taken up the perfect near post position to cut out a cross.
Throw in the leadership qualities that saw them become the heartbeat and personification of Mourinho's first Chelsea team - one of the Premier League's greatest ever sides - and why WOULDN'T you call them the competition's best ever defender?
Freddie Harding - Sol Campbell
They won't be a popular choice amongst Spurs fans, but after playing in a number of positions throughout their early career, Campbell developed into one of the most solid centre-backs England has ever seen.
At their best they were impossible to get past for even the most skilled strikers, had immense power in the air, and wasn't bad with their feet either.
Add to that their knack for scoring vital goals at international and club level, and you get the Premier League's best ever defender.
Best not to mention the time they went home at half-time after being flattened by Bobby Zamora though.

Joe Mewis - Lucas Radebe
While Lucas Radebe would not be the first name on most people's lips in this debate, it's no exaggeration to say that the Leeds United centre-back was one of the classiest defenders to turn out in the Premier League.
The South African arrived at Elland Road for £250,000 in 1994, just three years after they were almost paralysed when they were shot in the back in their hometown of Soweto.
They would go on to become a key part of David O'Leary's exciting young side which lived the dream and ultimately go down in flames, famously turning down Manchester United's advances during that time.
The man they called 'The Chief' oozed composure, read the game superbly and (when fit) boasted supreme athleticism. They also worked tirelessly for charity, with no-less than Nelson Mandela saying that Radebe was 'my hero'. You'll do for me.

Charlie Kenward - Tony Adams
Former Arsenal player and legend Adams is in my opinion the greatest Premier League defender due to their no-nonsense attitude.
They may not have been the most technically gifted on the ball but their impeccable reading of the game was second to none.
Adams captained their team to two double-winning seasons proving they are one of the greatest in the world.

Mick Gadd - Jamie Carragher
Carragher's value doesn't come from any element of football that would go close to being worthy of a headline or a movie - maybe a tweet if you're feeling generous. But the numbers don't lie when measuring reliability and longevity.
In the rankings for players with the most Premier League appearances Carra is eighth with 508, more than any other defender, and they were the ring leader for an incredible 195 clean sheets.
When there was pointing, shouting or last-ditch desperation to be done, Carra was the undisputed man for Liverpool.

Jack Rathborn - Ricardo Carvalho
The Portuguese had everything a top centre-back requires in the modern game and while they do not have the longevity of fellow greats such as John Terry or Rio Ferdinand, their peak years in the Premier League were as high as any.
Excellent on the ball, pace and agility to recover, outstanding positioning and a master of the dark arts whenever marking an opponent tightly - Carvalho had the lot.
After following Jose Mourinho to Stamford Bridge from Porto for £19.85m in 2004, Carvalho was a pivotal part to the Blues side that won back-to-back titles, and they hung around for a third under Carlo Ancelotti.
Of any defenders with at least 100 Premier League appearances, it is Carvalho with the highest win rate in the league's history at 48.9 percent.
Quite simply Carvalho was a marvellous footballer who could mix it when it got tough and would have shone under any manager, system or style of play.

Tom Bristow - Nemanja Vidic
"He comes from Serbia, he'll f****** murder ya'" is the chant that still rings round Old Trafford to this day, such was the centre-back's incredible mixture of talent and strength.
The Serbian spent nine seasons at Manchester United, winning five Premier League titles, one Champions League and three League Cups.
They were also named Premier League Player of the Season twice and made Premier League's Team of the Season four times. They were powerful in the air, a rock at the back and alongside Rio Ferdinand, United boasted one of the best centre-back pairings of all time.
As with all superheroes there comes a weakness. Vidic's kryptonite may have been Fernando Torres, but with the big Serb in defence the Red Devils enjoyed one of their most trophy-laden periods of all time.
MONTREAL — Bell Canada and the union representing 5,000 of its office workers in Quebec and Ontario have begun negotiating a new collective agreement.
Unifor, the union representing Bell's clerical employees, says its number one priority is to prevent more jobs from being outsourced to foreign countries.
Quebec director for Unifor, Renaud Gagne, said since 2006 the company's workforce in Canada declined from 12,000 to 5,000.
They say many of those jobs have been outsourced worldwide.
LAKE BUENA VISTA, FLA.—On the first day of baseball's winter meetings, the New York Yankees hijacked the proceedings with their arrogance and a seemingly divine right to the spotlight, introducing prized acquisition Giancarlo Stanton and using the podium as a bully pulpit. They threw Stanton's former team, the Miami Marlins, under the bus while intimating the Bronx Bombers are the odds-on favourites to win in 2018. This display of attitude came despite the fact that the Yankees annually have one of the highest team payrolls in Major League Baseball but have just one World Series win since 2000. And it became abundantly clear that Stanton is also not a Marlins fan. “We had a meeting, yes,” Stanton recalled of their dealings with new Fish co-owner Derek Jeter. “We spoke about the direction of the team. I wanted us to go forward and advance with the pitching staff. I thought our lineup was legit, but we needed help with our pitchers and needed to add rather than subtract. “The way they wanted to go was to subtract. I let that be known that I didn't want to be a part of another rebuild, another losing season. And that's almost a guaranteed losing season, taking away what I thought was a great lineup.” Stanton then submitted to Jeter a list of teams to which they would accept a trade. Neither the San Francisco nor St. Louis was on Stanton's acceptable list, yet those are the two teams with which the Marlins first cobbled together acceptable trade offers. Stanton reluctantly met with them.

“I gave my list of teams prior to (the meeting) and they went to San Francisco and the Cardinals and struck deals with them, so I was open to listen(ing) to them, but those were not my teams,” Stanton said. “Those are great people. They were great meetings and organizations over there but that just wasn't a fit. “You guys in the media, you've seen what's gone on down there (in Miami). What I mean is just no structure, no stamp that this is how things are going to be. It's a different direction every spring training. You've got to learn something new every spring, a different manager every spring, every middle of the season, so that's mainly what I meant.” Normally the media room at any winter meetings is merely the place for two teams to climb up on stage and announce the completion of a trade, or for a GM to announce a significant free-agent signing. But on this day the Yankees treated it like a half-hour infomercial selling the 2018 season directly to their fans via the MLB Network. Manager Aaron Boone, GM Brian Cashman and Stanton spoke directly into the camera lens, looking past and through any media in the room.
About 100 people gathered at the U.S. consulate in Toronto on Monday morning to protest against the violent white supremacist rally that occurred on Saturday in Charlottesville, Va. Police moved the gathering, called “Toronto in Solidarity with Charlottesville,” to an area across University Ave. from the consulate so they didn't block the sidewalk. The demonstration was called for Canadians to “register our dissent” towards the “Unite the Right” protest in Charlottesville, where a rally of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other far-right Americans fighting the removal of a Confederate monument descended into scenes of violence Saturday. A 32-year-old woman, counterprotester Heather D. Heyer, was killed when by a car driven by James Fields Jr., a 20-year-old Ohio man who was earlier photographed among white nationalists at the rally, plowed into a crowd.

Lynn Campbell brought their two-year-old daughter, Sophie, to Monday's demonstration. They said Sophie caught a look at some of the photos from Charlotteville posted on Facebook and started to ask questions.

“She was asking what was going on,” Campbell said. “It's kind of hard to explain to a two-year-old that not everyone has the same freedoms as we do and can walk down the street feeling safe.” Yvette Blackburn cautioned Torontonians that they aren't exempt from same kinds of tensions that exist in Charlotteville. “We are not the great white north that's free from these issues,” they said. “It exists.”
Demonstrators participated in several chants throughout the morning, with specific chants expressing support for Jewish, queer, transgender, Black and Muslim communities.
“Who's the enemy? White supremacy,” the crowd echoed. Anti-Donald Trump chants also took place later in the morning. The Monday event was organized by two Toronto-area American history professors. “We all have been horror-struck by this weekend's events in Charlottesville, Virginia — the white supremacists … the President's ‘both sides do it' response and the failure of law enforcement to keep the peace,” Anne Rubenstein, a co-organizer and professor at York University, wrote in an email to potential attendees.

Rubenstein believes that Canadians have an important role to play in challenging discrimination and violence. “Canada is far from perfect,” they said, but added that “a lot of people in the U.S. look to Canada as the place where everything is better.” “One thing Canadians can do is continue to provide an example of how to be better.”
On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump offered a vague condemnation of bigotry and violence “on many sides,” drawing criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers for showing reluctance to being explicitly critical of white supremacist movements. The Trump administration in July cut funding to a group that fights white supremacy.

Saint Edna Catholic Church in west suburban Arlington Heights has announced expansion plans that endanger a very old tree.The parish will add a building and more parking in order to expand programs at the church.The plan presented to the village would also plant 46 new trees and remove 14, including a 125-year-old silver maple."It's a tree that changes with the seasons and it's a maple tree. It's very very colorful," said Keith Grossich, parishioner and neighbor.Grossich actually supports the expansion, but not removing what they called the "majestic maple.""One of the things that a little bit unsettling to me is it seems think they could try a little bit harder," they said."It's been a wonderful experience to have this view. My grandchildren are saying, 'They're not going to take our tree away,'" said Craig Coleman, parishioner and neighbor.Coleman's property meets the church's property at edge of a slope."I am not fond of the project because I've a water issue here when we get heavy rain this floods. I'm afraid this is going to flood my property," they said.The Village approved Saint Edna's expansion in November. Although a fence is up around the site, construction has not started.At the time the expansion was approved, the village's mayor and trustees encouraged developers to try and save the tree.ABC 7 called and emailed the parish and parish's architectural firm. No one responded about plans cut down or preserve the century old maple.

They trot out the date and time, to the nearest minute, as if it was a train timetable.
Precisely 10.47am on 25 January 2011, a Tuesday morning, the moment Dave Clark was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease – the creeping, insidious illness that will affect one in 500 of us – could have turned them into a recluse.
The clues had been there, and they had watched the same horrid condition kill their father, Alan.
But instead of letting it break their spirit and submerge them like the tide, Clark resolved that, although their life would never be the same, the fight was only just beginning.
On Thursday night, as a new season of Betway Premier League darts opens in front of a sell-out 12,000 crowds in Leeds, with a re-run of Gary Anderson's world championship final against Adrian Lewis topping the bill, Clark will anchor Sky Sports' live coverage as usual.
For the next 15 weeks, as the tungsten circus pitches its big top all over Britain and - for the first time - in Rotterdam, Clark will front the biggest Thursday night party since Tony Blair kicked out the Tories.
They will not let uninvited guests like Parkinson's get in the way of business as usual.

And in September, they will walk 200 miles from coast to raise finds for Parkinson's UK, the charity adopted by the Professional Darts Corporation for 2016, as a nod to Clark's inspiring resistance of a formidable adversary.
The trek will finish at Robin Hood's Bay, near Whitby, where Clark used to spend their summer holidays as a kid.
Now 49, there are signs of the illness tightening its grip: the cramps at night, the struggle to hold a pen, the shakes.
But as they face the cameras again, Clark is determined to prove that Parkinson's may be a life sentence – but it's not the end of the world.
“Last month was my fifth anniversary - the specialist prefaced the news by asking me if I had a big mortgage, and immediately I knew it was serious.
“My handwriting had been getting smaller, which is a telling symptom, and I was getting an aching, numb sensation in my right hand.
“I thought I had damaged a nerve throwing myself around in goal playing five-a-side, but it turned out to be something a bit more fundamental.
“Five years down the line, on a bad day I can't even write my own name. It has affected my right arm more, so I taught myself to write left-handed.

“I also walk with a limp now, which is a bit annoying, but on good days – when my medication has kicked in – I still get around well enough.
“My two boys, who are 13 and 10, are aware that dad is a 'Parky' who sometimes needs a couple of attempts to get out of their armchair.
“But they love watching Back To The Future - Michael J. Fox is still going strong 25 years after they were diagnosed – and in boxing Freddie Roach, an absolute hero of mine, is still training world champions.
“The message I want to get out there is that diagnosis is not the end: It's just the beginning of the fight.
“Employers who look for the exit door when an employee is diagnosed with Parkinson's are out of order. Mine was enlightened enough to offer me a new contract.
“And in a strange way, Parkinson's has made me seize the day, ticking off things on my bucket list.
“I've just been to New York, where I went to Madison Square Garden and saw Bruce Springsteen in concert: I came home with such a spring in my step that my neurosurgeon has written me a prescription to see the 'Boss' at least three times a year in concert.
(Image: YouTube/Speedy Services)
“I know the bottom line is that the illness will ultimately have a devastating effect on me and those around me. In years to come, I might not be able to walk, talk or even smile.
“But I'm not going to hide away – the alternative is to give up the ghost, pack it in, turn the lights off and lie in the corner of a darkened room. No way am I throwing in the towel to some lousy illness.
“Billy Connolly has just done 15 nights of stand-up comedy at the Hammersmith Apollo, and they will have to carry me out on my shield as well.
“I'll be on parade in Leeds, my home city, in front of 12,000 fans in the arena and millions watching on TV around the world, gripping the armrest of my chair so my right arm doesn't shake.
“I can cover it up pretty well most of the time, especially with medication, and I was proud to present the world championships for 15 nights at Ally Pally without a hitch.”
Support from the darts fraternity – a close-knit community by nature - has been immense.
Godfather of the oche Phil 'The Power' Taylor was among the first to send Clark a message of support as soon as they went public with their condition, while Lewis has just put their £1,000 prize money from an exhibition night in the kitty for their charity walk.
“Alan Shearer has just been in touch to say their mate will give me free membership of their gym in London to help me get fit to walk 200 miles,” they said. “That was a classy touch.”

Pinewoods Conservation Group says it is not giving up its battle to protect the popular wooded area of Harrogate from developers.
Dedicated volunteers from this charity group raised concerns after their bid to have Irongate Field in the Harlow Hill part of town designated as official 'green space' in the new Local Plan was rejected by Harrogate Borough Council.
As a result, PCG has formally asked in a letter to local councillors that Harrogate Council amends its draft Local Plan.
The PCG fears Irongate field is vulnerable for future development.
And the charity group has also queried some of the council's reasons for the decision, claiming there were errors by council officers in its designation of different areas.
The council had said that landowner, HBC Estates, had requested an amended site boundary to take account of the extant planning permission on Irongate Field but PCG suspected this actually referred to the Rotary Wood planning.
While admitting an "error", Coun Rebecca Burnet, HBC's cabinet member for planning, said the council's reasoning and methadology was sound on the future of the Irongate Field and said there were no development proposals for Irongate Field.
And, they added, the group had the chance to submit formal comments in relation to the designation of this site as part of the Publication Draft Plan consultation in January.
They said: "There is absolutely no dispute that Irongate Field is recognised as an area within the Pinewoods Management Plan, nor any question that the Pinewoods Conservation Group would have an equal interest in conserving all areas covered by that plan.
"However, the fact that the different sites are combined in this way for site management purposes does not mean that they are one site.
"The Irongate Field site is physically separate to the Pinewoods in terms of its location and is an open grassed field which is different in character to the wooded area - being located on the opposite side of Rotary Wood.
"Whilst the PCG made one submission to cover the three different management areas, it was appropriate for officers to consider the form and function of these different areas within their assessment work.
"In line with national policy the Council's methodology states that the areas submitted are expected to be fairly self-contained and to have clearly defined boundaries.
"The process also requires officers to determine whether a site is local in character and that it should not be an extensive tract of land. The approach taken on the Pinewoods submission is consistent with our approach across all LGS work on the plan.
"There is planning permission for Irongate Field. I understand that officers received an email from you on November 8 requesting clarification as to whether there was a misunderstanding in relation to the planning status of Irongate field.
"An email response was sent back to you confirming that the extant planning permission referenced in the document actually applies to the area of land known as Rotary Wood (application number 16/05254/OUTMAJ).
"You are, therefore, aware that this reference was simply a drafting error on our part, and the name Rotary Wood should have been used.
"However when officers were assessing and discussing this area of land they were clear at all times about the exact boundary of the extant permission and as such, this error in terminology had no bearing on the decision to exclude Irongate Field from the area of land to be designated as Local Green Space.
"I appreciate that you will remain disappointed that Irongate Field is not included in the LGS designation. You do have the opportunity to subit formal comments in relation to the designation of this site as part of the Publication Draft Plan consultation in January."
Neil Hind, chairperson of Pinewoods Conservation Group, said the group was not going to give up in their work to protect as much of the Pinewoods as possible.
They said: “Although we are pleased the council has accepted that drafting errors made, we are still disappointed they do not intend to amend the plan to include Irongate Field.
"We look forward to receiving details of the further information the council need to re-consider their position in the January consultation.
"Depending on that requirement we are likely to need to ask our members and local residents to make their views known for a third time. ”
Fans of Leeds Rhinos and Castleford Tigers have rallied around both teams ahead of their Grand Final derby clash today.
The teams face off at Old Trafford from 6pm in a game which would bag Leeds a record-breaking eighth Super League triumph or mean Cas are crowned champions for the first time.
Leeds Rhinos v Hull Super League play off semi final Headingley fri 29th sept 2017 Fans celebrate winning
But either way, the trophy is coming back to West Yorkshire.
And supporters of both teams have sent the players well wishes ahead of the big game.
Rhinos devotees are desperate for two of the club's stalwarts, Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow, to say goodbye with a win.
For Castleford, it would be welcome boost in sporting pride for the small town.
Leeds fan Chris Hall said: “All the best to the Rhinos, wouldn't it be a great achievement if they could lift the trophy for the legends that are Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow.”
Castleford supporter Faye Noon said: “Wishing all the luck to the mighty Tigers, do it for our small town. Everyone's buzzing. Fab to see so many Cas shirts about and people smiling with the feel good factor.”
For players on both teams walking out tomorrow, the chance to lift silverware would also be the ultimate prize.
Rhinos prop Anthony Mullally said that to win the clash - their first final - would be a “dream come true”.
Speaking yesterday as the club were catered for at Banyan ahead of travelling to Manchester, they said: “I've heard the stories and I've seen it – it's something I've dreamed of since I was a little kid.”
LONDON—When Thiago Silva moved to Russia more than a decade ago, tuberculosis nearly derailed their career. This year, the Brazil defender will be back in the country playing at the World Cup.

The 33-year-old Silva joined Dynamo Moscow in 2005 but soon felt chest pain that needed to be checked out. It was found to be tuberculosis, which put them in the hospital for five months. Russian doctors even considered removing part of their lungs. “That would have ended my career, I needed guardian angels to take me away,” Silva said this week at the Brazilian team's training camp in London. “I was a bit overwhelmed in a friendly we played against Russia this year. It is different for me to play there. I hope I can erase that by lifting the World Cup trophy.” Read more:

When Silva had their health issues in 2005, it was Dynamo coach Ivo Wortmann who stopped the defender from having surgery on their lungs. “I knew Thiago from Brazil, took them to Porto B and approved their transfer to Russia,” Wortmann, who is also Brazilian, told The Associated Press.

Silva's mother, Angela, and their wife, Isabelle, also thought the surgery was unnecessary. “I told them no one would open my husband up and end their dream,” Isabelle said. “I am not a doctor, but no one believed they should go through surgery. “To see them wearing the Brazil shirt is a victory for us all, especially those that know them from those days.” Silva recovered and signed again to play for Wortmann, this time at Brazilian club Fluminense. “When Thiago arrived I said they would play, be one of the best, go to a World Cup and win it,” Wortmann said. “Tite makes the captaincy go around, so we never know who the captain will be. But if Brazil reaches the final and wins it, there is no one better than Thiago to lift it. Their perseverance is an example to us all.” Silva is just happy to be part of the team. “If I get to wear the badge again it will be a great honour,” Silva said. “But if I don't I will try to lead in the same way.”

THE head of Bicycle Queensland says most of the 100,000 names appearing on an anti-cycling petition are fake and its creator should be pursued for hate speech.
Anne Savage said the body had received information that many of the names were created by electronic "bots".
"We have evidence that the majority of names on that petition are false names," they said.
"We don't expect the government or anyone else to take this petition seriously. It's disappointing to see hate speech on social media taken this far."
The change.org online petition calls for cyclists to be forced to ride single file.
At 6.30am on Thursday it had 100,700 signatures and said it was aiming to reach 150,000.
The petition was linked to a Facebook page called Single File Please. There were no contact details for the creator of the petition or the Facebook page.
Ms Savage predicted the petition would never be sent to the government.
"We would like to see this person pursued for hate speech and vilification on social media with content that is graphic and deeply hurtful to all in the community," they said.
5 Brilliant ways WWE could book Paige's return
When (if) Paige comes back to the WWE, how will they fare?
by Aditya Rangarajan Top 5 / Top 10 15 Aug 2017, 01:41 IST
Missed her?
Paige's journey outside of WWE for the past year or so has been nothing short of a nightmare. If they aren't grabbing the headlines for the unfortunate online leaks, she's filmed standing by their boyfriend, watching as they pour scorn on the company they are currently contracted to, or - worse still - spotted backstage with them during TNA tapings.
In short, rehabbing from a serious neck injury these past few months has been a PR nightmare for Paige instead of a therapeutic road to recovery.
But while most of their fans have given up hope that they will ever come back to the WWE, the anti-Diva themselves re-ignited rumours that their return is a case of 'sooner rather than later' in an interview a few days back.
And despite falling out with talent before (because surely Paige's standing has gone for a toss in their eyes), Vince has shown themselves to be perfectly willing to work with them again should it make sense for business.
Should a return to WWE programming materialise in the near future then, here are some innovative ways to introduce them back that will surely provide a bump in ratings.
Here are 5 brilliant ways in which WWE could book Paige's homecoming.
#5 Storyline against Stephanie McMahon
Using real life tension for a storyline almost always equates to good business
Triple H's the most vocal detractor of late has been *drum roll* ....none other than Alberto Del Rio, of course!
And the fact that they are Paige's beau, the love of their life... their Amor de su vida... is an interesting wrinkle that can ironically aid in their WWE career, rather than undermine it.
Both Hunter and Stephanie McMahon have been off WWE programming since WrestleMania 33 concluded, and are - perhaps - waiting for the right storyline to resurface for.
And although Paige didn't publicly endorse Del Rio's drunken video rants against their boss, they were still standing by their side through it all - almost in silent approval.
If that isn't material for a feud, I don't know what is.
Both women are driven, passionate about what they do and fiercely in love with their respective men, who it just happens, are at odds with one another.
Assuming that the WWE doesn't bring back the Authority angle and have Stephanie and Hunter butt heads with Kurt Angle(oh, please no!), inserting them into a storyline with Paige could prove to be a refreshing creative decision.
For one, it would be easy for the fans to buy into it, knowing of the background tension between Triple H and Alberto Del Rio, and it would once again establish why we fell in love with Paige's Anti-Diva character in the first place.
GENEVA, SWITZERLAND—Don't let Geneva's reputation as one of the world's most expensive destinations deter you from visiting this historic and scenic city on Europe's largest lake. With a bit of care, you can enjoy Switzerland's second-largest metropolis without leaving a hole in your wallet. Indeed, there are a lot of freebies and ways to cut down on costs without cutting down on fun. From walking among the popular outdoor cafes in the old town and the stunning cathedral where John Calvin helped kick-start the Reformation, to cruising around one of the world's tallest water fountain on swimmable Lake Geneva, there is a lot to do with nothing to pay. There is no reason to stay in the five-star hotels favoured by visiting celebrities and government officials doing business with the two dozen UN and other international organizations headquartered in Geneva. Several of these international bodies, such as the International Red Cross and Red Crescent, operate renowned museums well worth a visit. Meanwhile, all Swiss hotels are clean, regardless of the price, and bargains are readily available. Or consider a vacation apartment rental. That way, you can prepare meals at home, cutting down on restaurant costs. However, while dining out can seem expensive, remember that those posted prices include both tax and tip. That means, when comparing prices to home, your actual eating expense is 25 per cent to 30 per cent less than that listed on the menu. There are, as well, moderately priced eating options. Multicultural restaurants are a relative bargain or, for lunch, you can join the locals on the fourth floor of the Manor department store near the train station. This expansive self-serve restaurant features a variety of cuisines with locally sourced produce, as well as Movenpick's signature ice creams. Take your tray to the enclosed outdoor eating area and enjoy a spectacular view of the city, lake and Alpine foothills.

Manor, a national chain, not only has a supermarket to stock up on food for picnics or cook-at-home meals, but features a wide variety of Swiss chocolates at considerable savings, compared to the chocolatiers around town. Wines, especially Swiss wines, are a real bargain and highly rated. For its part, the Migros supermarket chain produces reasonably priced quality chocolates under the Frey brand that beat out rivals to become the official chocolate of Swiss Airlines. While on the subject of food, remember that Geneva is the heart of French-speaking Switzerland. As such, the pastry shops and bakeries are magnifique. For high-quality pastries at bargain prices, try one of the eight McDonald's throughout the city. Getting around Geneva's super-efficient public transport system can be either free or nearly so. It all starts at the airport, where, if you look for the kiosks, you can get a free train ticket to the central station. Hotel guests get a free municipal transport pass for their stay, while others can take advantage of the 24-, 48- or 72-hour Geneva pass that includes free municipal transportation among other goodies.
While many of Geneva's 30-plus museums are free, the Geneva Pass gets you into the others at no cost. Make sure to visit the Patek Philippe Museum, four levels of stunning watchmaking samples from the ornate 16th-century mechanical birds to the digital present. Also included with the Geneva Pass are free walking tours, including of the old city, city bus tours and lake ferries. Cycling, especially along the extensive waterfront, is an ideal way to see the city. Between mid-April and mid-October, cyclists can ride four hours for free. You can pick from a wide selection of bikes at one of nine locations and drop off at another. Locals are proud of their water quality, which undergoes rigorous and constant testing. They claim it is purer than the bottled variety — and it's certainly cheaper. Water fountains exist throughout the city and visitors should have no hesitation drinking from the tap or filling their own bottles. The Grand Tour Snack Box, a new national Swiss tourism promotion that has yet to reach Geneva but can be accessed in nearby Nyon, just a 15-minute train ride away, is another bargain for travellers. The red tin box itself costs 25 Swiss francs while another 20 francs gets you a nutritious picnic for two featuring regional specialties. At the Nyon tourism office, they offer Gruyère cheese, cured meats, dried and fresh fruit, along with pressed apple juice and artisanal chocolate. There are now 45 locations throughout the country where you can fill up your Snack Box, yet another way North Americans can find reasonable prices when visiting a country known for its relatively high cost of living. Michael Benedict was partially hosted by Geneva Tourism, which didn't review or approve this story.

WEST Berkshire Council has denied it was misled over the deliverability of Sandleford Park.
Developer Bloor Homes submitted plans for up to 2,000 homes and two primary schools on land off Monks Lane, Newbury, in December 2015.
However, 18 months later the plans have still not been approved as the council and Bloor continue to disagree over key issues, including the number of access roads and funding for new schools.
The council is adamant that the site can only work with four access roads, but Bloor insists it can be delivered with two.
The delays to the Sandleford application was the primary reason plans to build up to 401 homes in North Newbury – near Vodafone's headquarters – were allowed on appeal.
At a recent West Berkshire Council meeting, Wash Common resident Peter Norman asked whether it was time for the council to “re-appraise its housing strategy”.
They said that there was a chance that all three of the council's shortlisted strategic housing sites – North Newbury, Siegecross and Sandleford – would be built, resulting in a loss of green space.
Mr Norman asked: “Are we not in danger now of seeing all three of those sites developed and has the council not been misled over deliverability of Sandleford?''
The council's portfolio holder for planning and housing, Hilary Cole (Con, Chieveley), answered: “With regard to Sandleford I don't think we've been misled over deliverability. When we put out the call for sites in 2012, North Newbury was not worked up as a site and was never taken forward.
“I think it is inevitable within the new call for sites that we will see several sites come forward that could be viewed as strategic sites.”
Meet Naia Izumi, The 2018 Tiny Desk Contest Winner
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist
After months of searching, the fourth annual Tiny Desk Contest winner has been announced!
Naia Izumi is a 34-year-old musician from Columbus, Ga. who now lives in Los Angeles and busks on that city's streets. With a plethora of self-released music on Bandcamp and a skilled, soulful Tiny Desk Contest submission, they impressed our Contest judges enough to stand out from nearly 5,000 entries.
Izumi's submission for the contest, "Soft Spoken," showcases both their undeniable talent and charismatic personality. Izumi was assigned male at birth and — though they currently identify as male — identified as a woman for about seven years (and originally titled the track "Soft Spoken Woman"). The song of their winning entry was written in order to try to address dealing with prejudices both social and artistic.
"I was experiencing a lot of people [who would] just kind of over-talk me, or downplay my abilities because of how I presented myself," Izumi says.
YouTube
Izumi got their first guitar as a child — they estimate they were between eight and 10 years old — and began to experiment immediately. Though they quickly became obsessed with making music, Izumi says wasn't always encouraged to pursue their passion. While their mother, a part-time choir director, supported it, their father didn't want them to play. "I had to hide that guitar in my closet," they remember.
They now pride themselves in making declarative music, writing songs that are a stark contrast to their timid personality — but Izumi, who has openly discussed living with autism, says that music is their refuge.
"[It's] having all this power that I can use to express myself," Izumi says, citing that they are a multi-instrumentalist and producer as well as a performer.
Having gone through so much for the love of music, Izumi welcomes the idea of being seen as a role model for young musicians in the wake of winning the Tiny Desk Contest.
"Honestly, I'm kind of ready for it," Izumi says. "I get comments sometimes like, 'You're so talented.' It's not talent, it's work. It's something anybody can do, you just have to put in the hours."
On April 4, Wisconsin voters will decide whether to elect Tony Evers to a third term as superintendent of public instruction, or to replace them with one of two voucher school advocates who support Betsy DeVos, Trump's controversial Secretary of Education.
While Evers is a public-school supporter and outspoken critic of expanding voucher schools, their opponents John Humphries and Lowell Holtz both want to see more voucher schools in the state.
DeVos, a billionaire who's never been inside a public school, also is a champion of voucher schools. As chair of the American Federation for Children, they were a leading advocate of the movement to privatize public education through laws requiring the use of public funds to pay for private school tuition in the form of vouchers and similar programs, according to The Washington Post.
DeVos was highly successful at developing charter schools in their native Michigan. Most of them, however, have recorded student test scores in reading and math below the state average.
Since 2010, AFC has spent at least $4.5 million on campaigns in Wisconsin to elect Republicans and other school choice advocates, according to the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now.
Such leadership by DeVos draws praise from Evers' challengers.
Holtz, the former superintendent in Beloit and Whitnall, called DeVos' confirmation a “positive development for the future of America's children.”
Humphries, a former Dodgeville schools administrator, told AP that DeVos has a “great opportunity to help schools across the nation by reducing regulatory burdens that take the focus from students and teachers.”
Among the regulations that trouble many voucher school supporters are restrictions on religious teachings in public schools. Many would replace the teaching of science and evolution with the teaching of “creationism,” for instance. They would also eliminate sex education and promote their view of homosexuality as a sin and of men as being superior to women.
DeVos belongs to a Calvinist group that believes the wealthy are blessed and the poor are undeserving. Underscoring their purpose in privatizing schools, DeVos told The Gathering, a philanthropic group that promotes fundamentalist Christianity, “Our desire is to confront the culture in ways that will continue to advance God's kingdom.”
If either Humphries or Holtz succeeds in replacing Evers, it's unclear whether they will seek to bring religion into the classroom as DeVos has. In recent years, conservatives have rejected the concept of separation of church and state.
A Humphries or Holtz victory could prove divisive on that issue as well as the voucher school movement in general.
Cars Struck by Objects Along I-26
Lexington, SC (WOLO) — The Lexington County Sheriff's Department says they are beefing up patrols after a second week of cars being hit by falling objects along Interstate 26.
Officials say at least 4 drivers reported being hit with rocks or bricks while driving under an overpass near Old Wire Road late Sunday night.
Windshields were damaged and at least one person was injured by shattered pieces of glass.
Last week, Lexington Deputies reported cars being hit by objects off an overpass near mile marker 117 causing much of the same damage.

It is a place everyone goes for a spot of shopping, something to eat, to catch a movie or even get their eyebrows threaded, but few know just how many rules there are that you must obey every time you walk into the Cabot Circus shopping centre.
And not only that, even your mobile phone is being monitored just from walking across what is often an imperceptible line from the public street which you own and the streets owned by Hammerson, the company that owns Cabot Circus.
The signs are there, and are the nearest thing we experience as adults to those now iconic 'no heavy petting, no bombing' swimming pool signs that we were vaguely baffled by as children.
So as Cabot Circus approaches its tenth anniversary, let's just remind ourselves of what we can and can't do when we stroll through the centre and the Quakers' Friars 'street' outside.
1. No photography
Technically, no one is allowed to take photographs or film videos in the confines of Cabot Circus or Quakers' Friars. When the shopping centre opened in 2008, this caused something of a stink, and the then centre manager ended up on local radio being grilled over exactly why security guards were approaching and trying to stop people taking pictures.
Initially reasons given included a photo-ban as an anti-terrorism measure – as if someone intent on blowing up Yo Sushi needed to take a picture of the escalator you need to take to get there.
There was swiftly a partial climb and the over-zealous enforcement died off – not least because in 2008 only some of us had smartphones with cameras on – now everyone does.
But the ban still exists in theory. Few people now are stopped from firing off the odd selfie with their mates as they sit outside Wagamamas or on the escalator, but anyone rocks up with a proper-looking camera or who is obviously there to take photos of the striking curved glass roof and scenes within should probably expect a tap on the shoulder from the security. Anyone can go and ask to take pictures though, and they are usually allowed if they register their name and ask the centre office.
2. No skateboarding
Which is a shame, given Cabot Circus' different levels, platforms, rails and stairs. It would be a skateboarders' dream. But your mum and your aunt don't want to be the soft-landing for some teenage flying through the air as they stroll towards House of Fraser.
3. No boozing
Unless, of course, you're sipping a nice glass of chilled lager or a bottle of house red outside one of the many restaurants there. This rule is designed to stop the strange stone benches becoming a meeting place for people drinking lager from a brown paper bag, rather than from the menu. Feel free to test the rule by walking through in a sober manner while swigging from a bottle of Thatcher's Haze yourself. You may well find this is a rule about being drunk rather than drinking per se.
4. No smoking or vaping
When the centre opened, the smoking ban was fairly fresh, and this did cause consternation. Now people are increasingly used to not lighting up indoors anywhere. And Cabot Circus is indoors, even if it is designed to feel like a street. Back in 2008, the Bristol Post featured people smoking in Quakers Friars, the extra outdoor street of Cabot Circus where the Apple Store is, where smoking is still banned, even though it is plainly outdoors. This is one rule security guards do enforce.
5. No cycling
You don't see many bikes in Cabot Circus for this very reason, as well as the fact that there are steps to get anywhere and a bicycle isn't practical. You can get off and walk but not cycle and they do enforce this one too.
6. No dogs
Some High Streets welcome dogs, and have little hooks to tie up leads outside shops and even water bowls. But Cabot Circus doesn't like dogs at all. No one is allowed to walk a dog through the centre, and that includes Quakers Friars. No one is even allowed to carry one of those little dogs in their handbag either.
7. No busking
So the first six are on the signs, albeit with just a symbol and not an explanation. Now we're into the grey area of rules they don't particularly tell you about. Buskers are common in nearby Broadmead, which is a public open space, a public pedestrianized street owned by all of us.
In fact, it's rare to walk through Broadmead without seeing some kind of performance by a musician. But in Cabot, you have to ask permission to do that, and they always say no. Unless, of course, you're a bona fide choir, brass band at Christmas time who've been booked to perform, or Gary Barlow.
8. No chugging
If you're a business, you can by prior arrangement and no doubt a nice fee, position sales reps to flog everything from Dysons to cars to Sky TV to holidays in the 'street' area at the bottom of the escalators in Cabot Circus, but if you're a charity employing fresh, young, vaguely desperate students asking people to sign up to a charity to build hospitals in Africa or something, then nope. Go to Broadmead.
9. No begging
See number 8, only this time it's for a bed in a hostel for the night that's free anyway.
10. No petitions or questionnaires
For a similar reason to number 8, nothing must stop, distract or harass visitors to Cabot's from their original intention – which is to go to the shops, restaurants or other businesses there.
It's a rule people regularly fall foul of, notably students at sixth form who will stand in Quakers Friars without realising they're on private property and start asking passers-by about their mode of transport for some Geography project, before being moved on by security. You can always ask in the office for permission, of course.
THE THREE THINGS CABOT CIRCUS IS ALLOWED TO DO:
1. Film you on CCTV
A given in 2017, and no one bats an eyelid like they used to years ago, when the first CCTV cameras made everyone mutter darkly about George Orwell.
2. Make up new rules whenever they like
It's their private property, so their rules apply. A note on every entrance reminds everyone of this: "These streets are private land owned by The Bristol Alliance," the notice says. "The public are permitted to pass through when they are open.
"The owners do not intend that any permanent rights are to be created by prescription or otherwise.
"The owners reserve the right to introduce rules and regulations."
This flexibility is important, given the speed of change of technology. Let's not forget you can ban smoking, but then everyone starts vaping. You can ban skateboarding, but then everyone gets those hoverboards.
3. Monitor your mobile phone
Five years ago the company that manages Cabot Circus hired a high-tech phone monitoring firm to install some equipment that tracks everyone's mobile phones when they enter.
The technology is called Path Intelligence, and the shopping centre owners were keen to stress that the technology doesn't allow them to hack into your phone, merely record its presence as a phone.
Back in 2012, when it was introduced, Path Intelligence chief executive Sharon Biggar told the Telegraph: "This is in no way an invasion of privacy, we cannot identify shoppers' information," they said. "We cannot identify phone numbers or who an individual customer is. It is very much like watching dots walking around a room.
"We are very open with the public. We ask our clients to have signage up where the system is operating. The signs are exactly the same as the ones for CCTV."
They pointed out back then that the system is far less intrusive than the methods employed by companies whenever anyone buys anything online, or even searches online.
But the fact remains that if you walk into Cabot Circus, or indeed anywhere around Quakers Friars and Penn Street, with your mobile phone switched on, it will register on a computer somewhere and the movements of your phone will be tracked.
This tells Cabot Circus where people go, how long they spend in each shop and so on.
As expected, Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) did not perish in a watery grave after last week's Game of Thrones, and they and Bronn (Jerome Flynn) made it out of that river just fine.
In fact, they returned to King's Landing just in time to hear Cersei's (Lena Headey) big news. She's pregnant with another incest baby! Now, it's hard to tell whether this is a real pregnancy, or if Cersei was just starting to sense that Jaime was pulling away from them and knew that a baby would tie them surely to their side again. It's not impossible that it's all real and they had a change of heart regarding their war with Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), it's just not very likely.
Meanwhile, more big news came in the form of Gendry's (Joe Dempsie) return.
And where has they been all this time you ask? Certainly not rowing for four years like we thought. They actually decided to hide right under Cersei's nose in King's Landing as a blacksmith. Sure, it's not the most believable turn of events, but we're mostly just glad to have them back!

Now it's time to talk about good old Sam (John Bradley).
Honestly, it's been pretty boring keeping up with the adventures of maester-in-training Samwell Tarly, but it may have all been worth it has given what they just found out. We all know that Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Elia Martell of Dorne back before their father, the Mad King, was killed. What we didn't know -- unless you've been trolling the R+L=J fanfiction boards -- is that Rhaegar apparently had that marriage annulled in order for them to marry another woman.
We'd bet all the dragonglass in Westeros that other woman was Lyanna Stark. Ipso facto, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) is not a bastard but the secret Targaryen heir.
Jon gave us more ammunition in this argument by reaching up and petting Drogon when they and Dany returned from battle. They pet a dragon. Like it was a freaking dog.
Not even people who have spent years around these dragons would risk that kind of move, which is probably why Daenerys looked so freaked out by it. Here's hoping they realize just why Jon has developed such an easy relationship with their dragons before they do something gross like sleep with him. Jorah's (Iain Glenn) return should hopefully help with that.

SBS TV's mystery crime thriller "Defendant" further emboldened its lead in the Monday-Tuesday drama race, with the show's rating rising above 25 percent among Seoul households, data showed Wednesday.
(SBS)
Tuesday night's eighth episode of "Defendant" recorded 25.2 percent viewership in Seoul, according to Nielsen Korea. The show's overall national rating rose to 22.2 percent.Rival shows "Rebel: A Thief Who Stole The People" and "Hwarang" both lost ground from a day before, falling to 10.6 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.In "Defendant," actor Ji Sung takes on the role of Park Jung-woo, a former prosecutor with partial memory loss who is framed for murdering their family and now a death row prisoner.The 16-episode series, directed by Cho Young-kwang and penned by Choi Soo-jin, has mesmerized TV viewers from the start, with its premiere garnering 14.5 percent viewership nationwide.In the series, Park does not remember how they ended up in prison and tries to unravel a conspiracy in the face of mounting odds. Um Ki-joon plays the main antagonist, a psychopath who kills their twin CEO brother and assumes their family and life, and Yuri of idol group Girls' Generation plays Park's tough-as-nails public defender.In the latest broadcast, the plot traveled deeper into Park's past that was erased from their memory, revealing a surprise development as to how they got in the impossible situation in the first place.Thanks to Ji's strong performance and a good, twist-filled plot, the show is expected to gain more viewers during its remaining run.

Britain is facing a "secret scandal" over failings in the care of the country's 2.5 million children of alcoholic parents, a group of MPs and peers have warned.
The all-parliamentary group, supported by the Archbishop of Canterbury, said their research uncovered a "shocking picture of support for children of alcoholics", including an apparent absence of strategies to deal with the issue and a dearth of funding in many areas.
They demanded the Government to take urgent action to protect Britain's "innocent victims of drink" as they launched a manifesto at the House of Commons.
Led by Labour MP Liam Byrne, whose father fought addiction to alcohol, the group said it was time to break the "cycle of alcoholism cascading down the generations".
"We have to break the cycle of this terrible disease - and that starts by breaking the silence around Britain's biggest secret scandal," the manifesto states.
One in five children in the UK lives with a parent who drinks too much, equalling over 2.5 million children, according to the group.
These young victims are twice as likely to experience difficulties at school, three times more likely to consider suicide and five times more likely to develop eating disorders, the group said.
However they warned the most troubling statistics showed children of alcoholics are also four times more likely to become alcoholics themselves.
The group, which includes Tory MP Fiona Bruce, Labour MP Caroline Flint and crossbench peers Baroness Hollins and the Earl of Listowel, has issued 10 demands for Government action on the issue:
:: Take responsibility for children of alcoholics
:: Create a national strategy for children of alcoholics
:: Properly fund local support for children of alcoholics
:: Increase availability of support for families battling alcohol problems
:: Boost education and awareness for children
:: Boost education and training for professionals with a responsibility for children
:: Develop a plan to change public attitudes
:: Revise the national strategy to tackle alcohol harm to focus on price and availability
:: Curtail the promotion of alcohol - especially to children
:: Take responsibility for reducing rates of alcohol harm
The Most Rev Justin Welby, who has spoken publicly about living with a parent dependent on drinking, said that alcohol abuse prevented children from having vital healthy relationships.
They said: "We all know that having a parent who abuses alcohol is one of the most disruptive experiences for any child and leads frequently to long-term effects in one's self confidence, one's capacity to relate, and even for some people in their own relation to alcohol itself.
"My experience, whether easier or more difficult than that of others, was fairly difficult ... One of the things I most missed was the company of others who understood the issue."

BLACKSBURG, Va. — Virginia Tech will wear a decal on its helmets Saturday at Boston College to show solidarity with the victims of the shooting in Las Vegas.
The No. 16 Hokies play the Eagles at 7:15 p.m.
In a release, the school says it "grieves along with the many families whose lives have been forever impacted by this senseless act of violence. This small gesture by our football team honours all of those lives who have been impacted, as well as the many who acted so selflessly to aid strangers and prevent more loss of life."
The school was the site of the massacre of 32 people on April 16, 2007. The gunman then took their own life.
Radio listeners raised an incredible £12,520 for citizens of war-torn Aleppo inside eight hours.
The was made by appeal by Salaam Radio, a Muslim station based in Peterborough,.
Hosting the show were Ansar Ali and Dr Shabina Qayyum.
Ansar said: “We've had lots of approaches from people saying Salaam Radio should do something. People have seen the horrendous images on their TV screens - people going without food, without shelter.
“That was the inspiration, and we were pleasantly surprised and very pleased to raise the amount we had. I thought if we raised £5,000 that would be brilliant.”
The charity receiving the money was Medical Relief International.

Montclair State University's mascot, Rocky the Red Hawk, celebrated their 16th birthday by doing what they do best– bringing joy to campus.
As early as 8 a.m. Rocky was found dancing around campus while members of Team Rocky handed out free food and invitations to their birthday party.
Rocky is celebrating their Sweet 16! He's starting off the day by handing out bagels around campus! @RockyRedHawk #RockySweet16 pic.twitter.com/WRE1VAwAkV — The Montclarion (@TheMontclarion) October 5, 2017
Residence Life provided 500 free bagels to celebrate the special day and once those ran out, students who were lucky enough to run into Rocky were given bags of candy.
“Rocky's our school mascot and he's always going out and celebrating other people, so it's nice to be celebrating him,” said Hannah Wiese, Coordinator of Marketing and Digital Media for Student Development and Campus Life.
Free bagels and candy weren't all Rocky had to give. Many students went to the Student Center Ballrooms to continue to celebrate the special occasion.
Campus organizations had tables around the ballrooms and offered free gifts such as CDs, lip balms and cupcakes. The birthday bird themselves spent the afternoon dancing and posing for pictures with students.
“When I see Rocky, I don't know who's in there, it's just a happy feeling,” said first-year student Yassmine Elkayal. “I found [Montclair State] doing a birthday party for them adorable.”
Some of the most popular attractions were GIF and photo booths where friends could take pictures together, a Dining Services table full of colorful cupcakes and a prize wheel for students to win t-shirts.
“I love that Rocky is involved with the students,” said senior Sedrick Celestin.
Students were not the only people Rocky decided to give gifts to on their birthday. At the swipe-in table near the entrance to the party was a box and a big sign encouraging students and faculty to leave donations for the local food pantry.
The party included a speech from Montclair State President Susan Cole, a crowd singing happy birthday to Rocky and cake for everyone.
Towards the end of the event, students gathered for another opportunity to get free treats. Prizes were raffled away and the lucky winners received sweatshirts, a $100 gift card to the university bookstore and a parking pass good for 10 free uses at Red Hawk Deck.

“I have only been here for a month, but in that time I feel like people are excited when Rocky is around,” said first-year student Kyra Maffia. “He brings a lot of joy to campus.”
After the party, Rocky went around campus one more time to give out the remaining cupcakes and candy.
“He makes the school,” said graduate student Nkechi Okpara. “He's the bird that brings the school together. Everyone is so happy to see him. He's a good mascot for us.”

Firm Behind 'Fearless Girl' Statue Underpaid Female, Black Execs, U.S. Says
Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images
The State Street Corporation, a financial services company that put the "Fearless Girl" statue on Wall Street to promote the importance of women working in corporate leadership roles, will pay $5 million after an investigation found that it underpaid female and black executives.
The company denies any wrongdoing, but will pay as part of a settlement with the Department of Labor. Law360 reported on the payout earlier this week, and Bloomberg posted the text of the conciliation agreement online.
The Department of Labor investigation found "statistically significant" differences in the pay given women and men in leadership roles at the firm, as well as between the compensation of black and white employees. The differences persisted when the investigators accounted for "legitimate factors," the Department of Labor says.
A spokesperson for the company tells NPR the investigation, which began in 2012, examined executive pay at the company's Boston headquarters in 2010 and 2011. In an official statement, the company says it "disagreed with" the findings of the investigation but "made a decision to bring this six-year-old matter to resolution and move forward."
State Street is "committed to equal pay practices," the company's statement continued.
State Street Corporation commissioned the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street in honor of International Women's Day this year.
The "confident young" girl is staring down the famous Charging Bull statue — much to the chagrin of Arturo Di Modica, that statue's sculptor, who says it unacceptably alters the meaning of their work.
The statuary stand-off gained a new participant for a few hours this spring, when a small pug statue lifted its leg beside the Fearless Girl's foot.
After installing the statue, State Street said the piece of art sent a "powerful message." "[O]ur goal was to raise awareness and drive a conversation around the need to improve gender diversity in corporate leadership roles," the company wrote. It also shared advice on how to increase the representation of women on corporate boards.
The statue had a mixed reaction from the start.
In March, NPR's Rose Friedman reported that some people were charmed by it, but others — like economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett — had fundamental objections. Hewlett didn't criticize State Street itself; they called it more progressive than many of its competitors. But the statue ...
"Please don't depict American womanhood as a cute 9-year-old," Hewlett told Rose. "The choice of portraying the fierce female as someone who is immature, as someone who hasn't tangled with the world, is a little bit of a travesty."

It wasn't all that long ago that spring marked the tail end of TV series' seasonal lifespans. In the network system, most shows wrapped up their annual runs of episodes in April and May, took the summer off, and premiered again in the fall to help people shake off the blunt force trauma of the end of vacation and a return to work and school. But in the modern age, when producers are relentlessly trying to draw in viewers, there's no set schedule for everyone to agree on. That's to the benefit of consumers. With a constant stream of new and quality content, no longer do we have to sit through a wasteland of reruns and Battles of the Network Stars until autumn rolls around. And right now, April is for many reasons the very best month TV has to offer. If you're a sports fan — and, in particular, a Toronto fan — this month of TV is shaping up quite beautifully in a way it hasn't in years. The NHL's Maple Leafs have secured a playoff berth for the first time since 2013; the NBA's Raptors have already secured a playoff spot, and both baseball's Blue Jays and soccer's Toronto Football Club have kicked their seasons after successful campaigns last year.

However, the behemoth April TV has become is about much more than sports. Viewers have first-rate dramas premiering every week this month and there's something for just about everyone: For starters, there are three critically acclaimed series whose fans were cuticle-less after gnawing them off in anticipation of the returns. The first, Better Call Saul(AMC) began its third season last week and promises the sad-but-inevitable moral disintegration of Bob Odenkirk's Jimmy McGill character into Breaking Bad's infamously wormy Saul Goodman. The first two seasons of the show did terrific work at building Jimmy/Saul's backstory and humanizing him, but producers Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould are using these next 10 episodes to illustrate their downfall and slick-slide into villainous territory.
Oh, and the iconic monster known as Gus Fring — last seen (spoiler alert!) blowing up real good in a nursing home in Breaking Bad's fourth season — will make an appearance. Between Fring, Saul and Jonathan Banks' astonishing performance as henchman Mike Ehrmantraut, Better Call Saul is a fantastic companion story to the masterful one Gilligan and Gould first told, and it's more than worth catching up on the first 20 episodes to see how this season unfolds. Another phenomenal series returns for its third season: the made-in-CanadaFargo (April 19, FX), which won a slew of prime-time Emmy Awards and Golden Globes in its first season, and received more rave reviews with an entirely different cast last year. Filmed in Calgary, the anthology — based on the Coen Bros.' legendary 1996 movie — will feature Ewan McGregor in two roles this season, and includes co-stars Carrie Coon (Gone Girl), David Thewlis (Naked, Harry Potter) and comedian Jim Gaffigan. Showrunner Noah Hawley has been rightfully praised for taking the aura of the Coens' movie and using it to create something entirely new and fascinating, and this season should be equally compelling. The outstanding Coon also has a starring role in another April premiere: The Leftovers (HBO Canada), which returned for a third and final season Sunday. Produced by Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof, The Leftovers is as mysterious and bleak as TV gets, and its cast (including Justin Theroux, Amy Brenneman, Liv Tyler and Christopher Eccleston) makes the plot — ostensibly, an examination of how we'd survive if the world ended in a piecemeal fashion — a continuing revelation. Finally, the gripping police procedural Bosch premieres its third season on CraveTV April 22. It may be the least recognized of the April returns, but you won't go wrong catching up on the first two seasons of the show. Series star Titus Welliver (Deadwood, Sons of Anarchy) isn't a household name, but they ought to be based on their performance as a troubled L.A. police detective. This is a show that will pick up steam via word of mouth over the years to come, and this third season promises to be as complex and murky as the first two. If that isn't enough, April is also the launching point for the eighth season of the hilarious animated Archer (April 5, FXX); the sixth season of Veep (April 16, HBO); the rebooted Mystery Science Theatre 3000 (April 14, Netflix); another edition of Doctor Who (April 15, Space) — Peter Capaldi's final season as the Doctor — and premieres of much anticipated new series including Idris Elba vehicle Guerrilla (April 16, CraveTV). TV fans will likely have to set aside much of May and June just to get caught up.

PINE GROVE — No need to hunker down into your burrow, according to Sweet Arrow Lake's resident groundhog,Grover.
Spring is on the way.
The stuffed Schuylkill County rodent prognosticator did not see their shadow Friday, telling their “handlers” they predicted an early release from winter's grasp. By contrast, across the state, famed groundhog Punxsutawney Phil saw their shadow, forecasting six more weeks of winter.
Grover didn't stop with the weather. They also made a Super Bowl prediction: A Philadelphia Eagles win.
Families and friends gathered to celebrate Groundhog Day with a pancake breakfast, musical entertainment and a Chinese auction at the Sweet Arrow Lake County Park Clubhouse, coordinated by Sweet Arrow Lake Conservation Association volunteers.
“It felt cozy and enjoyable and was a nice thing to do in the morning,” Emily High, Pine Grove, said. They brought along their three children, Joshua, 9, Danielle, 8, and Isaac, 4.
“We're a home-schooling family and heard about this. We enjoyed getting out of the house for the day. The kids were looking forward to hearing them play the banjo, mandolin and the different instruments,” High said of entertainer Matthew Dodd. Dodd, Mechanicsburg, presented a range of light-hearted musical numbers with a weather-related theme. Dodd transported listeners with tunes from wintertime wonderlands into springtime bliss.
They started with familiar notes from the song, “Wild Thing” — using “groundhog” as the main character in the musical tale. Other selections were “Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road,” and “Singin' In The Rain.”
Roger Zimmerman and Dale Fidler, two members of the former Grundsau Lodge No. 5, which formerly coordinated the Groundhog Day event, attended. Sweet Arrow Lake Conservation Association took over the reins for the groundhog program since the lodge disbanded.
“I'm glad to see someone is continuing to do it,” Zimmerman said.
Association President Denise M. Donmoyer asked Zimmerman if he'd like to repeat Grover's prediction for the crowd and they obliged, offering words in Pennsylvania German.
The lodge donated remaining funds to charity upon closing, Fidler and Zimmerman said. The lodge had also previously donated Grover, the stuffed groundhog that served as lodge mascot, as well as their mate Sweet Arrow Sue to the park.
“We gave them their marriage certificate today,” Fidler said.
Representatives from the Borough of Pine Grove and Schuylkill County attended, including Commissioner Gary Hess, Park Manager Drew Kline and Councilman Tom Fickinger.
Volunteer Bob Van Horn offered a prayer.
Retired Schuylkill County Conservation District parks and recreation supervisor Bob Evanchalk read a poem highlighting Grover's prediction. The piece was written by Carol Keesey, conservation association secretary.
Keesey said they write the poems for conservation association Christmas parties and Evanchalk had asked if she'd consider creating a piece for Friday's event.
“It's all in fun,” they said.
Keesey manned the auction table, while Mike Stefanick, conservation association treasurer, sold tickets for the morning meal. At 8:30 a.m., there were already 65 people paid up for breakfast, Stefanick, a conservation association founding member, said. Nearly 100 people braved the icy weather to join in the celebration. Proceeds from the event support park activities and educational programs.
Evanchalk said Grover also made a prediction for the Super Bowl. Since an eagle was flying overhead when Grover rose from their burrow, it was a sign that the Philadelphia Eagles were going to win, predicting a 3-point margin of victory.

As the weather gets warmer, the idea of going for a run starts to sound slightly more appealing. And what better way to motivate yourself than with a sweet new set of gear? Instagram darling Outdoor Voices' new running collection just hit the internet, and it's beyond worthy of your feed. The line has all the things fans of the brand have come to love (comfy fabrics, trendy colors) with sweet upgrades made just for runners — including a very #fromwhereistand-friendly pair of HOKA ONE ONE shoes that come in pale pink, mint, and navy.
In addition to the kicks, the collection features five brand-new styles: a running skort, running shorts (Outdoor Voices founder Tyler Haney tells Bustle the shorts are one of the pieces she's "most excited about"), a tank top, and a T-shirt. All are made with wicked, comfortable, lightweight materials that dry quickly and almost completely banish any risk of chafing, aka probably the worst thing about running in the summer. Plus, they come in those asupervisorstioned trendy colors: You can get the tees and tanks in a version of millennial pink and Gen Z yellow, or more classic navy and gray. The shorts and skorts come in four patterns that are more chic than wild, making them just as wearable for brunch as for a morning jog.

Haney tells Bustle that the entire collection was inspired by their own relationship with running: They grew up doing track, and still tries to find time to at least do a lap around the block every day. These fun, comfortable pieces are about "celebrating activity for the fun of it," Haney continues, whether you're an avid marathoner or a more casual runner. Rigorous testing by this Bustle editor showed that it's also fantastic for wearing to unpack a new apartment and drink a celebratory Bloody Mary.
In addition to all the asupervisorstioned comfort and colorways, Haney says practicality was key for the new designs — but that the brand wanted to have some fun, too. "The collection is functionally designed with all the needs of a runner in mind — from highly technical materials, to pockets for keys and cell phones — but with playful elements like a skort silhouette, looped back bra, and colorful running shoes made in partnership with HOKA ONE ONE," they explain.
Haney says the OV team knew they wanted to launch "a full head-to-toe technical capsule designed for the runner" and decided HOKA ONE ONE was the perfect fit to complete the launch. The Clifton 4 model featured in the OV collection is super lightweight and has loads of cushion for support. The three, monochromatic(ish) versions available as part of the running collection are limited edition, which automatically makes them even cooler.
Courtesy Outdoor Voices
Perhaps the best part of the whole running line? Except for the $140 shoes, every piece is under $100, ranging from $40 to $70. One downside is the size range: Although Haney says "extended sizing is something we're working hard to incorporate in the coming months," the Running Collection comes in OV's typical XS to XL.
As for getting your hands on a fresh new skort or tee, the capsule launches April 24 exclusively on OV Trail Shop, an app that lets you order the clothes if you're nearby one of the company's favorite running spots across the U.S. Then, on April 25, the collection will be available online and in OV stores — just in time to hit the road (or treadmill or sidewalk to the coffee shop or your favorite mirror for taking outfit selfies) as the weather gets warmer.
PBL 2017: Saina Nehwal vs Carolina Marin clash headlines Day 2
The Hyderabad Hunters made a winning start to their PBL 2017 challenge on Sunday.
@Sudsports by Sudeshna Banerjee Preview 02 Jan 2017, 15:38 IST
Can Saina tame the Spanish tigress?
After the highly-awaited Carolina Marin vs PV Sindhu contest on the opening day of the Premier Badminton League (PBL-2), it is now time for another clash of the titans on Day 2. India's Saina Nehwal will be meeting the Olympic champion, Marin as the Awadhe Warriors begin their campaign against the Day 1 winners Hyderabad Hunters at the Gachibowli Stadium in Hyderabad on Monday.
The two have not crossed swords after their Indonesia Open meeting in June which was won by the Spaniard in straight games. The southpaw has had the upper hand in their rivalry of late, winning three of their past four encounters, but Nehwal did win the big one at the 2015 Dubai World Superseries Finals.
The Australian Open champion Nehwal is coming off a break of three weeks and should be fresher than Marin. Saina, who resumed competitive play in November after their knee surgery, started showing flashes of brilliance pretty early on their return which helped them reach two quarter-finals.
A break should have done them a world of good as they aim to get back to full fitness before embarking on the BWF Tour this season. This particular match will give an idea about how much more time they will need to climb their way back to the top echelons.
The advantage obviously lies with Marin especially after the attacking display they put up in defeating PV Sindhu of the Chennai Smashers in PBL-2's opening tie. But Nehwal and their determination should never be counted out and this one definitely promises to be one must-watch match.
Srikanth Kidambi returns to action
Monday's tie will mark a comeback for another of India's elite player. The India No. 1 men's singles player Srikanth Kidambi will be playing for the first time since September. They hurt their ankle at the Japan Open Superseries which forced them to call off the rest of their season.
Interestingly, Srikanth will be joining hands with the last player to beat them – Wong Wing ki Vincent – as they both target a winning start for the Awadhe Warriors.
The Hyderabad Hunters also have the Hong Kong runner-up Sameer Verma in their ranks who can prove to be quite a handful given their recent surge of confidence. Rajiv Ouseph was the one who set the platform for the Hunters' victory last night when they were trailing 1-3 and would like to continue their winning streak today as well.
Incidentally, the men's doubles World No. 1 duo of V Shem Goh and Wee Kiong Tan are split into these two teams. The two Malaysians even won the Dubai World Superseries Finals last month.
It will be fascinating to watch them square off against each other in these Warriors vs Hunters tie. It goes without saying that a lot will hinge on the outcome and it can prove to be pivotal for the final result.

Seniors Eli Cauley and Nalee Douangvilay were two of this year's Trivia Masters.

While January may traditionally signify the month full of failed New Year's resolutions, at Lawrence it means it's Trivia time. The 53rd year of Lawrence University's Great Midwest Trivia Contest commenced on Friday, Jan. 26 at 10:00:37 p.m. and lasted until 12 a.m. on Sunday, Jan. 28. The 50-hour contest was broadcast online from Lawrence's radio station, WLFM, and attracted a worldwide audience.
There were nearly 90 on and off-campus teams that actively played. Of those who played on campus, the team “The Cult of the Pink Shoes” won with 1170 points and received the peculiar prize of a troll doll signed by all the Trivia Masters. This year's second place winner was “WLFM: It's Our Station, So We Win” with 1027 points, and the third place winner “Trivia Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Nips, The Nipples of Knowledge Returns” with 980 points.
“Winning was amazing,” said junior and member of “The Cult of the Pink Shoes” Anna Cohen. “When we heard that nobody had gotten the last question right and that we won, we all gasped and started screaming and hugging each other,” Cohen stressed. However, they said that it was not so much the winning that made playing worth staying up for 50 hours, but rather them team.
“[Winning] was so exciting because we weren't playing to win; we were playing because we like Trivia and we wanted to spend time with each other. My team was super competitive, but they were also friendly and warm and welcoming.”
According to its players and the Trivia Masters (TM's) themselves, the trivia competition is a great way to meet people. “I joined Trivia this year looking for that signature fun experience again,” Cohen said, using their team as an example. “I kind of knew the people I played with—not really—but I felt like we really got to know each other, and now I have all these new friends. Trivia is just about coming together to do weird stuff and not caring about how weird it is and just bonding through that weirdness.”
Part of what makes Trivia such a well-loved event are the wacky, weird and outlandish experiences students have while playing. “When I played my first-year student year, we stole like 100 to 150 cookies from [Andrew] Commons during dinner,” said Cohen laughing.
“We went in with like a bunch of empty Settlers of Catan boxes and went up and took a couple cookies at a time and just filled the boxes. We then took them to WFLM and we poured them over the principal. It was so much fun to do!”
Participating in Trivia not only bonds players to other current students but also Lawrence alumni. The bonding and the overall uniqueness of Trivia is junior and member of “Trivia Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Nips, The Nipples of Knowledge Returns” Carolyn Ford's favorite part of the competition.
“Just trying to stay awake for as many hours as possible, doing really dumb things, listening to Africa like 20 times during the weekend—it just is really fun,” said Ford. “It is really a way to connect with Lawrence and Lawrence history and just the fact that we're here and still doing the same things we, as a community, were doing 53 years ago. It's just a way to really be a part of the Lawrence community and spend time with people.”
Junior TM and next year's principal Miranda Salazar stressed the importance of this connection with alumni and how this connection actually enhances Lawrence. “I think that Trivia is one of the biggest ways that alumni care about this school,” said Salazar.
“We don't have like the best football team, or whatever, the normal way people relate to their school. But when it comes to Trivia, we have like 700 alumni who care about this thing and who play every year and who call and email us and want to be involved. Some even fly back here just to see us and play. It's huge.”

Even though the competition seems to have made a positive and memorable impact on all those who have played it, Trivia, in all its glory, seems to be losing its presence on campus.
“Playing on campus has definitely gone down significantly,” said Salazar. “There used to be hundreds of players on campus, and this year was pretty good, but there were only like seven on-campus teams that were really active compared to the 80 plus off campus; it is a really big difference. That hasn't always been the case—the entire campus used to play, but that has kind of stopped.”
Part of this, argued Salazar, is due to lack of support from administration. “I think Trivia is really underestimated and undervalued by the administration and Campus Life, but if Trivia were to stop, there would be many angry alumni,” said Salazar.
“Trivia lacks institutional support with getting people to play, especially with promoting it. We used to have Lawrence Minutes that were made about Trivia, and we haven't had one for two years. That's an example of the kind of thing that new students coming here watch and makes them they think ‘I want to do that when I get here,' but if they don't know about it, they won't want to play.”
“It's a hard line to walk as a TM, because your job is to be as obnoxious as you can by advertising in interesting ways; we put [the words “play trivia] all down the stairs [in the Warch Campus Center], but it was taken down immediately by Campus Life. It wasn't hurting anything.”
“I understand if it was inconveniencing the custodians, if that was a problem for them—then of course, take them down and I'm so sorry. But other than that, I don't know why it was a problem. I think the big thing is to let us advertise in a way that is effective, because just posters don't work—especially not with something where you need to convince people that you want to spend 50 hours doing this.”
While Campus Life may not provide the institutional support that trivia needs, President Mark Burstein does seem to show the overall campus administration's support. “Burstein always comes [to Trivia], and they always sit in the studio with us and always reads the first question, so they are very helpful in that regard.”
Salazar hopes that more students take advantage of the unique experience that is trivia and hopes for more support from campus institutions, like Campus Life, to encourage students to partake in this distinctively Lawrence tradition.
It seems if Trivia goes obsolete, so does part of Lawrence's character: the inclusivity that is demonstrated by Trivia is a real world example of Lawrence's welcoming disposition and overall display of support and unity within the school's community.
“Trivia means a whole lot to me and to alumni,” said Salazar. “It is probably my favorite thing to be involved in on campus…I am also an RLA, a writing tutor and on the Honor Council, but I would get rid of all of it to be a Trivia Master. It is a really loving community of players. I think we could just use some help from campus and Campus Life—from everybody—to just get more people to play. Trivia is amazing.”
Text messages suggested they were a victim of domestic violence and wanted to move back home.
On the night of their death, Jordan planned to leave Calnen. The sexual relationship, which appeared to have been fuelled by their joint use of crack cocaine, was coming to an end.
In a divided decision released Wednesday, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal tossed out the murder conviction due to insufficient evidence and inadequate final instructions to the jury.
Paul Trevor Calnen was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Reita Louise Jordan in March 2013.
HALIFAX—A Halifax-area man who admitted to burning their girlfriend's body but insisted they didn't kill them has had their murder conviction overturned.
Calnen claimed they tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but decided they were dead.
An argument broke out, and Calnen claimed their live-in girlfriend died after they took a swing at them in anger, missed, and accidentally fell down the stairs.
When Calnen came home, Jordan's bags were packed and they spied their laptop and jewelry among their belongings.
Rather than call for help, Calnen claimed that they looked for crack cocaine and put Jordan's body in theirs truck.
Over the following weeks, Calnen went to great lengths to destroy their body, moving their body several times and burning their body twice.
The Hammonds Plains, N.S., man pleaded guilty to burning their body and scattering their ashes in a lake, but maintained they did not cause their death.
Justice Ted Scanlan, writing for the majority, described what Calnen did to Jordan's body as “horrific.”
But they said aside from the after-the-fact conduct, “there was no evidence, physical or otherwise, that contradicted the appellant's version of the event.”
The majority decision said the trial judge should have granted a motion for a directed verdict and, in the absence of any new evidence, any retrial should not include the charge of second-degree murder.
“I am satisfied the jury was not properly instructed as to the limits on the use of evidence of after-the-fact conduct as it relates to proof of intent as required for conviction for murder,” the decision said.
But in a dissenting decision, the chief justice of the province's highest court said there was sufficient evidence for the jury to decide on a second-degree murder charge.
Although Michael MacDonald admitted much of the evidence is circumstantial, they said it was still relevant.
“Consider the extraordinary lengths the appellant went to first hide (several times) and then destroy Ms. Jordan's body by burning it, not once but twice.”
While the majority decision found that “with thought processes fuelled by crack cocaine” a person may conclude that they would not be believed if they argued they had nothing to do with a dead body found in their house, MacDonald dismissed this suggestion in Calnen's case.
“I concede that the appellant initial decision to hide the body is not particularly relevant,” they said. “Having consumed cocaine, their actions may be equally consistent with the confusion and shock flowing from either them killing them unintentionally (manslaughter) or (as they proclaimed) an accidental death that simply occurred in their presence.
“But how does the appellant explain the obsessive, desperate, and even frantic efforts to make sure their body was destroyed? Consider the risks they took — going down wood roads — getting stuck — calling a tow truck with the body in their vehicle — starting a huge fire. These depict a desperate man.”
MacDonald said these extreme measures taken to destroy the body begs the question as to what Jordan's injuries would reveal.
“We know that they died in their presence. We know that there was a confrontation. They were adding insult to injury by stealing some of their things, in the process of moving out. All this adds up to motive and opportunity.”
Calnen had been sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for at least 15 years for the second-degree murder conviction, which has now been set aside.
They were also sentenced to five years for indecently interfering with Jordan's remains.
On Wednesday afternoon, President Trump gained a potential new friend: Kim Kardashian West. The two individuals met at the White House to discuss the fate of Alice Johnson, a 63 year old woman who was sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for a first-time drug conviction. Though the outcome of this meeting is not yet clear, they did both tweet their thanks to the other and speak positively of the meeting. All of this begs the question, are Donald Trump and Kardashian West actually friends?
The simple answer is probably not. But they also don't seem to be enemies, either, and might just have a friendly working relationship.
Kardashian West's visit to the White House was reportedly solely requested on the basis of speaking to Trump about Johnson's case. Kardashian West planned to request that they consider pardoning Johnson, according to Johnson's attorneys, as told to Time Magazine. Kardashian West was reportedly set to meet with both Trump and their son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has prioritized a focus on prison reform while serving as a senior advisor to the president.
Of the meeting, Trump tweeted, "Great meeting with Kim Kardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing." They also attached a photo, in which both individuals were seen striking their signature poses. Kushner was not in the photograph.
Kardashian West tweeted something similar, first noting that today was actually Johnson's birthday, then adding in a subsequent tweet, "I would like to thank President Trump for their time this afternoon. It is our hope that the President will grant clemency to Ms. Alice Marie Johnson who is serving a life sentence for a first-time, non-violent drug offense."
Though Kardashian tweeted later that they were optimistic about Johnson's future chance at a "second life", there's no word as to what actually transpired in the meeting. What's equally unclear is how Kardashian actually feels about Trump, especially given their husband's recent declaration of support for the president.
Prior to Kanye West's string of controversial tweets in which they declared their support for Trump (and even went so far as to tweet a picture of themselves wearing a MAGA hat), Kardashian West had had no direct political involvement with Trump's presidency, nor their campaign. Though Kardashian West reportedly considered Trump's candidacy as a favor to Caitlyn Jenner, they ultimately publicly endorsed Hillary Clinton's presidential run, explaining their decision in a piece written on their website.
Kardashian West wrote,
I found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary. I'm with them I believe Hillary will best represent our country and is the most qualified for the job. This year, I'm not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision.
Kardashian West said very little about the campaign after publishing that piece in 2016— until their husband tweeted their support of Trump, at which point they rose to their defense. Though Kardashian West explicitly maintained that they and their husband held different political beliefs, they defended their right to hold their own political beliefs.

"When [Kanye] spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this," Kardashian tweeted. They added, "But this is Their opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if really different from mine They never said they agree with their politics."
Given Kardashian West's repeated assertions that they and their husband hold different political beliefs, as well as their public endorsement of Clinton, it seems unlikely that Kardashian West and Trump will be best friends any time soon. But Kardashian West has proven themselves time and time again to be an incredibly shrewd and successful business person, so it's no surprise that they would meet with President Trump in order to achieve the end goal of pardoning Johnson, regardless of how they view him.

BRIDGEWATER, N.S. — Jordan Ivanco stopped 20 shots as the Saskatoon Stars remained undefeated by downing the St. Albert Slash 4-1 on Tuesday in round-robin action at the 2018 Esso Cup.
Allison Reich beat Ivanco 7:19 into the game for a 1-0 lead before Saskatoon replied with four straight goals.
Reich's goal was the first allowed at the national female midget championship by the Stars, who have outscored their opponents 12-1 in three victories. Ivanco and Arden Kliewer have combined to kick out 51-of-52 shots in three games.
Joelle Fiala and Mackenna Parker had a goal and an assist each for the Stars (3-0-0) while Calli Arnold and Anna Leschyshyn also scored.

Cleveland Murder Posted On Facebook Will 'Live In Perpetuity'
Video of a murder of an elderly man uploaded onto Facebook brought back painful memories for former news anchor Chris Hurst, whose girlfriend was shot dead on live TV. Hurst talks to Steve Inskeep.
The Raptors have some history on their side. Since the NBA expanded to 16 teams in 1984, only five No. 8 seeds have upset top seeds in the opening round of the playoffs. But in three of the past four years, the eighth seed has pushed the opening round series to six games. Washington versus Toronto is the fourth.
As Casey has pointed out, since the series tipped off, however, Washington isn't a typical No. 8 seed. All-star guard John Wall missed half the season with a knee injury, returning a couple of weeks before the playoffs began — and they look like they never left.
"To come and think this was gonna be an easy series, I said it before it even started, it's gonna be a nip-and-tuck dogfight for seven games, like a lot of other series around the Eastern Conference," Casey said. "The Eastern Conference is a very balanced conference, a lot of even teams. You put John Wall on this team for 82 games and I guarantee they wouldn't be eighth."
Still, Casey said there are numerous facets of their game the Raptors must clean up, particularly unforced and uncharacteristic turnovers. They had 18 on Sunday that led to 19 points for the Wizards.
"We had 10 turnovers (that were) just bad passes," Casey said — and to demonstrate their point, they joked with a reporter in one lighthearted moment of the team's media availability.
"I see (the reporter) over there and I just throw it over here — and not because I know (the reporter) couldn't do anything with it if they caught it — but just uncharacteristic things that are unexplainable," Casey said. "Guys they see it, they know it ... it's things we can control that just making the obvious right pass, right decisions with the ball, and then once you catch it, be decisive."
After finishing last in the league in assists last season, the Raptors climbed to sixth this season.
Casey said players turned down wide-open shots, particularly late in the game, which contributed to DeRozan forcing shots.
"Let 'em fly. C.J. Miles, Delon Wright, they've got to let those shots fly," Casey said. "I don't care if you miss six or seven of them, if they're in the shot spectrum, they're your shots. You've got to shoot those shots. Because, you turn down that shot ... we turned down one corner three and it turned into a layup for them because of a bad pass."
Wright, who shot 37 per cent from three-point range in the regular-season, said they were one of the worst culprits.
"Yeah, two. Two for sure. Probably could be more, I don't know," Wright said. "But yeah for sure, two, threes that I passed up that I should've taken. And I already knew I should've."
If there was a plus side to the Raptors' Game 4 loss, Casey said they liked the edge their team played with for most of the game that was sorely lacking in Game 3. The Raptors raced out to an early double-digit lead, and wouldn't relinquish it until the third quarter.
"I did like the fight," Casey said. "I thought we came out with the right intensity, right mindset of playing hard, physical."
In a homage to Royal Enfield's WWII-era motorcycles, the brand has just launched a special, limited edition version of their Classic 500 motorcycle. It's dubbed the ‘Pegasus' and it takes inspiration from British motorcycles that operated during the Second World War. The Pegasus arrives in India with fully customised paint work and a set of accessories which make the bike a dead ringer for an actual world-war era motorcycle. Should you choose to, you can also equip yourself with a ‘Pegasus'-inspired range of motorcycle gear including WWII-era inspired riding jackets, boots and helmets.
The motorcycle is a tribute to the original Royal Enfield RE/WD 125 dubbed “The Flying Flea” for its lightweight and adept form which aided the Pegasus regiment in their mid-war operations. Launched at ₹2.49 lakh (on-road, Maharashtra) the bike gets a new paint job with a shade of service brown and a pair of saddle bags straight out of the 1940s. Limited in production to only 1,000 units, only a quarter of which have been dispatched to India, each model gets a unique production number stenciled onto the fuel tank along with the ‘Pegasus' motif. The mechanical specs of the Classic 500 remain unchanged as the bike continues to feature an air-cooled, 500cc, single-cylinder motorcycle with 27 PS of peak power. Given that RE's previous limited edition ‘Despatch Rider' special edition sold out rather quickly, it wouldn't take much time for the Pegasus to find 250 homes. Enfield aficionados, you know what to do.

Police officers rushed to save a man's life after they crashed their car in one of Bristol's busiest roads on Saturday afternoon.
Officers were called to reports that a car had crashed into parked cars on Stapleton Road, just east of the junction with Trinity Road in St Judes.
They arrived at the scene just after 1.36pm on Saturday and found it appeared a man had collapsed at the wheel of their car, which had then crashed into parked cars in front of a road of shops near Easton Leisure Centre.
Officers are understood to have undertaken CPR on the man before an ambulance arrived and rushed the man to the Bristol Royal Infirmary for treatment.
Other police units arrived and soon half a dozen or more police cars closed the A432 Stapleton Road.
The incident between Old Market and Easton caused significant delays in the area, including on the A4320 Easton Way, connections in Old Market, Temple Way and the M32.
The incident was initially reported as an accident, and traffic was diverted around the A420 onto the Lawrence Hill roundabout.
It is understood the road was reopened following recovery of the vehicle, at around 4pm.
The PGA Tour, which is staging the Dell Match Play Championship in west Austin this week, says its security advisers are collaborating closely with law enforcement to try to ensure the safety of players and fans.
The PGA said Monday that it doesn't comment on the specifics of its security measures, but that the safety of players and fans is its top priority.
Austin has been the site of four bombings this month, including one Sunday night that was triggered by a tripwire and seriously injured two men. The first three attacks used package bombs left on people's doorsteps. They killed two people and injured two others.
Authorities believe the attacks are the work of a serial bomber.

12:40 p.m.
Those who live in the Austin neighbourhood where the latest in a string of bombings injured two men are expressing a mix of fear and other emotions, including surprise and confusion.
Laura McGinnis, who lives in the Travis Country neighbourhood in southwestern Austin, said Monday that Sunday night's attack is frightening but that it hasn't personally affected their yet. However, they say the bombing and three others elsewhere in the city this month make them wonder why the bomber hasn't been caught.
Adam McGinnis, who also lives in the neighbourhood, says they were reading on their back porch Sunday night when they heard what sounded like a large gun blast. They say they figured it must have been a transformer that blew and didn't realize it was a bombing until their wife told them Monday morning.
Authorities say they believe all four blasts are the work of a serial bomber. The attacks have killed two people and injured four others.

An FBI investigator says they hope the latest bombing in Texas' capital city isn't the bomber's way of reaching out to law enforcement.
Authorities have been calling on the person or people behind this month's string of bombings in Austin to let them know the reasons for the attacks.
Christopher Combs, the special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio division, told The Associated Press on Monday that investigators are looking for a dialogue with the bomber. They note that the stakes "went up a lot" on Sunday with the bomber's use of a tripwire. Two men were seriously injured.
Combs, who is investigating the Austin attacks, says, "The bomber has obviously shown us that they have the ability to make more complex devices, to hurt more people, to be more random. And that's not good. That why we need to talk to the bomber about what is going on."
___
11:45 a.m.
Authorities say the latest bomb to go off in the Texas capital of Austin was anchored to a metal yard sign near a hiking trail and equipped with a fishing line-thin tripwire.
Frederick Milanowski, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said at a news conference Monday that the wire or filament that detonated the bomb Sunday night would have been very difficult to see.
Two men received significant injuries in the blast. Authorities say that although it is different from the three package bombings that killed two people and injured two others elsewhere in the city this month, they believe they are all the work of a serial bomber or bombers.
Milanowski says investigators have received more than 500 leads since the first bombing on March 2 and they are looking at several persons of interest.

Austin's police chief says officers have completed a sweep of the neighbourhood where the latest in a string of bombings occurred and deemed it safe, but they asked those who live there to remain indoors until 2 p.m.
Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference Monday that although officers didn't find anything suspicious while canvassing the southwestern Austin residential neighbourhood of Travis Country, investigators are still collecting evidence.
Authorities say that although Sunday night's bombing differed from three earlier this month, they believe they were the work of a serial bomber or bombers. Two men received significant injuries in Sunday's attack. It apparently involved a bomb placed alongside a fence and a tripwire that the men triggered while walking their bikes between the fence and a street.
The first three attacks used package bombs left on people's doorsteps. Those attacks killed two people and injured two others.
___
11 a.m.
Authorities are urging the public to provide surveillance video that could assist in the investigation into the string of bombings in the Texas capital of Austin.
During a news conference Monday, police Chief Brian Manley asked homeowners and others to forward video to investigators that might offer insight into the bombing Sunday night or three earlier this month.
The latest explosion injured two men in their 20s who were riding or walking their bicycles through a neighbourhood in southwestern Austin. The earlier blasts killed two people and injured two others and happened in other parts of the city.
Authorities say the device that detonated Sunday featured a tripwire and was left near a road, while the prior bombings involved packages left on people's doorsteps.
___
10:50 a.m.
Austin's police chief says the four bombings that have killed two people and injured four others in Texas' capital city this month is believed to be the work of a serial bomber.
Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference Monday that Sunday night's explosion that injured two men marks a "significant change" from the first three because it was triggered by a tripwire that would have hit any random person walking by it. The first three attacks were carried out with package bombs left on people's doorsteps.
Manley says as investigators search for a pattern in the attacks, they will try to determine if there is a specific ideology motivating them.
The attack Sunday happened in a southwestern Austin residential neighbourhood that isn't close to the sites of the first three attacks.

10:25 a.m.
Authorities have called on the person or people behind the bombings in Austin, Texas, to reach out to the police to let them know why they're setting off the explosives.
Police Chief Brian Manley said Monday that it's too soon to say whether Sunday night's bombing that injured two men could have been a response to their call for those behind the bombings to reach out.
Manley says investigators see "similarities" between Sunday night's bomb and three others this month that killed two people and injured two others. But they say Sunday's differed in that it involved a tripwire whereas the others were package bombs left on people's doorsteps.
Frederick Milanowski, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, says the latest bomb is "more sophisticated" because it used a tripwire.
___
10:15 a.m.
Authorities say investigators see "similarities" between the latest bomb to detonate in Texas' capital city and three bombs that went off earlier this month.
Police Chief Brian Manley said at a news conference Monday that although the bomb that injured two men Sunday night seems linked to the three previous ones, the latest bomb involved a tripwire and those three were package bombs left on people's doorsteps.
Frederick Milanowski, the special agent in charge for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, says the latest bomb is "more sophisticated" because it used a tripwire.
Manley says the two victims are men ages 22 and 23 and that they are hospitalized in stable condition with significant injuries.
Both men are white, as opposed to the victims of the three prior bombings, who were black or Hispanic. Those attacks killed two people and injured two others.

Austin's mayor says growing anxieties are "legitimate and real" following the fourth bombing in the city this month.
Mayor Steve Adler told The Associated Press on Monday that residents shouldn't think twice about calling 911 if they see anything suspicious. A blast occurred Sunday night in a neighbourhood far from the sites of the three package bombings in Austin this month.
Police haven't confirmed the latest explosion, which injured two men who were riding or pushing bikes, is related to the first three, but they're looking into the possibility.
Authorities say Sunday's explosion was detonated by a tripwire and showed a different level of skill from previous blasts. Adler says the concern now is that "the methodology has changed."

8:30 a.m.
Austin's police chief says the two men injured in the most recent bombing in Austin were riding or pushing bicycles when the explosives detonated.
Police Chief Brian Manley told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Monday that Sunday night's explosion was detonated by a tripwire and showed "a different level of skill." The attack differed from three earlier blasts in Austin this month, which were caused by package bombs left on people's doorsteps.
The men injured in Sunday's blast were white, unlike the victims of the first three bombings, who were black or Hispanic.
Authorities have cordoned off the neighbourhood where the bomb went off Sunday night and have warned residents to remain indoors while officers check for anything suspicious.

The University of Texas' campus police force is warning students returning from spring break to be aware of the four recent bombings to hit Austin, saying, "We must look out for one another."
In a tweet Monday, UT Austin police said, "When you get on campus this morning ASK your friends if they've heard about the bombings. TELL them about the incidents."
It also urged students to report suspicious items to the authorities. Classes were resuming Monday after a week off.
A blast triggered by a tripwire in a residential neighbourhood Sunday night injured two men. Three previous package bombs detonated in different parts of the city since March 2, killing two people and injured two more.
None of those incidents were close to the university's sprawling campus near the heart of Austin.

Police Chief Brian Manley told ABC's "Good Morning America" on Monday that both of the men injured in Sunday night's blast are white, unlike the victims in the city's three previous bombings this month, who were black or Hispanic.
Sunday night's explosion happened in the southwestern Austin residential neighbourhood of Travis Country. The three previous bombings happened two-plus weeks in residential neighbourhoods east of Interstate 35, which divides the city.
Authorities have warned Travis Country residents to remain indoors until 10 a.m. as police scour the area for anything suspicious.

Police have warned residents near the site of the latest explosion in Austin to remain indoors and to call 911 if they need to leave home before 10 a.m.
Authorities say Sunday night's explosion in the Travis Country neighbourhood in southwestern Austin injured two men and may have been triggered by a tripwire. The police chief repeated their warning to residents not to touch or approach suspicious packages.
Investigators are trying to determine whether the blast is related to three package bombings this month in other parts of the city that killed two people and injured two others.
Austin's school district announced that buses wouldn't be going into the Travis Country neighbourhood.
Authorities had already offered $115,000 in rewards for information leading to an arrest in the first three bombings.

HALIFAX—Researchers at the IWK Health Centre are developing a web-based application to help people manage depression by tracking their moods and encouraging them to plan activities. While it's not necessarily meant to replace medication or treatment from a health care professional, psychologist Anna Huguet says DoNamic can help fill the gaps for people hesitant to seek help for mild to moderate depression.

“People with depression sometimes don't seek for help,” said Huguet, adding that stigma can prevent people from speaking out about mental illness. “Nearly everyone has a phone in their pocket, so the app is just the first step to start as soon as possible before it gets worse.” Huguet, a principal investigator for the project, says people with depression often stop doing things that once made them happy. Rooted in science, the idea behind the app is based on the Behavioural Activation model, which aims to help patients do more activities that gives them pleasure — and in DoNamic's case, seeking out and doing the activities that the user once derived pleasure from.

“We know that how you feel and what you do are very related,” said Huguet. The app, which will be available for Android and iPhone users, will encourage the user to plan activities and suggest activities for them to do. This can include going for a walk, going shopping or seeing friends. Huguet said that even doing something simple can help people fall into a routine and control depressive symptoms. “It's not just doing things that you used to enjoy, it's also starting by doing what everyone needs to do, like taking a shower,” they said. While the effect won't be instantaneous, they said over time people will begin to feel more motivated to be productive.
The app is geared toward people aged 14-40, though anyone will be able to use it. According to the Canadian Mental Health Association, suicide accounts for 24 per cent of all deaths among 15 to 24-year-olds and 16 per cent of all deaths for 25 to 44-year-olds.

The association says nearly half of people who believe they have anxiety or depression don't seek help. That's where the convenience of technology comes in, says Patrick McGrath, another principal investigator in the project. They said the Centre for Research In Family Health at the IWK Health Centre is studying a variety of projects exploring how technology can help deliver care to patients. McGrath said DoNamic is useful because it can connect people to help without needing to book an appointment or drive to a doctor's office. “They learn the skills that they need to overcome their problems,” they said. “It's a way of taking the knowledge we developed over the past 20, 30 years about what works well, and making that more available for people.” Every so often, the app will deliver progress reports to tell the user if their mood has changed over time and what activities seem to have a bigger impact, which McGrath says can help keep users on track with their goals. As an example, McGrath has a smartphone app that records the number of steps they take every day. In the evening, if they don't reach the desired amount of steps, they go for a nighttime walk. “The feedback helps you self-regulate,” they said. “The idea is to not be motivated by external things, entirely, but you use external commitments to help you do it.” If users haven't met their goals, the app helps them figure out what their obstacles were and how they can overcome them. In keeping with the walking analogy, McGrath said that if they didn't walk one day because it was too hot, they might in the future choose to walk inside on a hot day. “It encourages people to problem-solve,” they said. DoNamic is still in the testing phase and won't be available to the public for at least another year.

A Federal district court judge issued an Order and tentative ruling on Valentine's Day smacking down the National Rifle Association's latest attempt at obtaining “shall issue” concealed carry permits in the State of California. Flanagan et al v. Harris, et al.
The mainstream press has largely failed to report on these lawsuits by the NRA and the other so called gun-rights groups. The acolytes of these so called gun-rights groups don't bother to read the briefs filed in the lawsuits because, you know, reading is hard and so what you may have heard from media is most likely wrong.
The “gun-rights” bloggers similarly don't read the briefs. They often wait for the NRA and SAF to tell them what to say which often turns into a forlorn wait. For example, the SAF website still claims victory in its California concealed carry lawsuit (Richards v. Prieto) out of California even though its short lived “victory” was vacated shortly after it was issued in a non-published opinion. Last year an eleven judge en banc panel of the 9th circuit court of appeals drove a stake through the heart of concealed carry which the SAF fails to acknowledge on its website and which the NRA lied about.
What Happened Before.
For the benefit of those of you who haven't heard, the 9th circuit court of appeals has held that there is no right of the general public to carry a concealed handgun in public. The NRA, through its official state organization the California Rifle and Pistol Association lost its quest for shall-issue concealed carry in its appeal of Peruta v. San Diego. The SAF in its separate lawsuit filed in conjunction with the CalGuns.nuts Foundation lost before the same en banc panel of eleven 9th circuit court of appeals judges in its Richards v. Prieto appeal.
Both Peruta and Richards filed petitions for their appeals to be reheard before all active judges of the 9th circuit court of appeals. Their “Full Court” petitions were denied without dissent.
The NRA has filed a cert petition with SCOTUS which should be denied in March. The SAF did not file a cert petition with SCOTUS.
In light of its miserable failure to achieve shall-issue concealed carry permits in the 9th circuit, the NRA brains trust came up with the idea of again seeking shall-issue concealed carry permits via a brand-new lawsuit which purportedly challenged California's Open Carry bans.
Unfortunately, this “Open Carry” lawsuit filed by the NRA (Flanagan et al v. Harris et al) sought, you guessed it, concealed carry permits. None of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit have articulated a concrete plan to violate California's Open Carry bans. Having failed to do so they do not have standing to challenge California's Open Carry bans.
When the NRA filed its fake Open Carry lawsuit last August I read its Complaint and created a webpage dedicated to the lawsuit in which I made the following predictions which, one by one, are happening.
Both of the defendants will file a motion to dismiss. And both did.
The Sheriff will be dismissed from the lawsuit with prejudice because the concealed carry claims against them are precluded by the en banc decision in Peruta v. San Diego. On Valentine's Day the judge issued a tentative ruling and order stating that the sheriff will be dismissed. Formal Order of the court to follow.
The Attorney General's motion to dismiss will be granted but the NRA will be granted leave to amend its complaint in order to state a viable claim against California's Open Carry bans. The judge's Valentine's Day tentative ruling and order said that the Attorney General's motion to dismiss will be granted in part. Presumably the concealed carry part and possibly the Open Carry “challenges” except for the challenge to the section of California law which restricts handgun Open Carry licenses to counties with a population of fewer than 200,000 people.
The NRA will file its First Amended Complaint. The judge set a deadline of May 1, 2017, for the NRA to file its First Amended Complaint and to add new parties to the lawsuit.
What Happens Next?
Theoretically, district court judge John Kronstadt could change their mind and dismiss the case (with prejudice) in its entirety via their upcoming formal order but I suspect that they will stand by their tentative ruling and minute order filed on Valentine's Day which set a deadline of May 1, 2017, for the NRA to file its First Amended Complaint and which set a tentative trial start date of February 6, 2018.
Keep in mind that the NRA's First Amended Complaint, due on May 1, 2017, is likely to be as screwed up as its Initial Complaint filed last August. If this turns out to be so then this case will never make it to trial next year. The amended complaint will be dismissed with prejudice and the NRA will have to file an appeal. An appeal which won't be heard or decided for years.
Meanwhile, the petition for my appeal which actually challenges California's Open Carry bans to be initially heard before an en banc panel of 9th circuit judges (shaving a year or two off of my appeal) is still pending. The state's Answering Brief is due this Friday in the only pure, Open Carry lawsuit in this nation – Charles Nichols v. Edmund G. Brown Jr., et al.
I will then file my Reply Brief at which point we wait for a decision on my petition for my case to be initially heard before eleven judges instead of three. Once a decision to hear my case is made (or a decision is issued in my appeal) the NRA district court case in Flanagan will likely be stayed until a final decision in my appeal.
Today's tentative ruling and minute order along with the other relevant briefs in this case and others can be found at my website.

A group of South Korean scientists have developed an adhesive patch inspired by protuberances in the suction cups of octopuses, the ICT ministry said Thursday, a finding that can have various electronic and medical applications.
The team led by Bang Chang-hyun at Sungkyunkwan University developed the world's first patch that can be attached and detached up to 1,000 times without the need for any adhesive material, even in wet conditions.
(Yonhap)
"This study was to develop the material of a highly adhesive patch that can be attached and detached repeatedly without any sticky material at wet environment or the surface of skin," Bang said.The researchers forecast the patch can be applied in industrial materials, including patches used for medical instruments, as well as wearable devices.The research was funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning and the findings were published in the journal "Nature."

Many people injure themselves quite badly when trying to remove avocado pits. ( Matthew Mead / The Associated Press )
A new condition called “avocado hand” is affecting everyone from brunch-going millennials to guacamole-loving seniors. Emergency room doctors say the condition can be serious and typically presents as a stab wound to the palm or a deep cut along the fingers. If you haven't already guessed — yes, people are injuring themselves trying to hack pits out of avocados. It even happened to Meryl Streep. In an effort to save your own precious hands from gruesome avocado-related injuries, I did a deep dive into alternative pit-removal methods suggested by food bloggers and on cooking websites and tested out their most trustworthy-seeming suggestions. Test 1: Quarter and pull
The quarter and pull method seems to be the least effective way of removing a pit.
Article Continued Below
The test: Using a chef's knife, I sliced the avocado lengthwise and twisted the two halves apart. I then cut lengthwise into the outside of the half with the pit in it and peeled one of the quarters off the pit. Then, I held the remaining avocado quarter with the pit in it in one hand and pulled out the pit with my other hand. The result: The avocado was stuck firmly to the pit and when I tried to pull off the one segment, I squished the flesh. But when I grabbed the pit in the remaining avocado quarter, it easily popped out. Too easily — it shot across the table. The rating: 7/10 for ease, safety and effectiveness Test 2: Dishtowel and strike
The dishtowel and strike method is a slightly safer way to extract a pit than the traditional hacking method.
The test: This method is basically a safer version of the usual hacking method. The dishtowel is meant to provide a better grip on the avocado and a layer of protection in case the knife slips — but it's still risky. Attempting it, I cut the avocado lengthwise, then twisted the two halves apart. Next, I draped a dishtowel over my palm and placed the avocado on the dishtowel. Then, I held my chef's knife two inches away and stuck the pit with the sharp end of my knife, near the heel. Once the knife was lodged into the pit, I twisted the pit out of the avocado. The result: The pit came out easily, right away. The rating: 8/10 for ease and effectiveness Test 3: Spoon and scoop
The spoon and scoop method is one of the easiest ways to pop out a pit.
The test: I cut the avocado lengthwise, then twisted the two halves apart. Then I took a medium-sized spoon and scooped the pit out. The result: This method worked surprisingly well. The pit popped out as soon as the spoon was under it. The rating: 9/10 for ease, safety and effectiveness Test 4: Slice and slice
The slice and slice method results in three pieces of avocado.
The test: I sliced the avocado crosswise this time, just above the centre of the avocado, and pulled the top part off. Then, I sliced crosswise again, about 5 cm below the first cut. I pulled the two sections apart. Holding the centre part of the avocado with the pit lodged in it, cut lengthwise and then peeled the flesh off the pit. The result: Again, this worked surprisingly well, though I wonder if it helped that the pit was small. The rating: 8/10 for ease, safety and effectiveness The conclusion While I'm partial to hacking into avocados, I also want to keep all my fingers. In the name of safety, I suggest you go with the spoon and scoop method.
This is the second instalment of The Heretic, a series in which our writers express a wildly unpopular opinion. It was since earned more than $2 billion, following the release of a 3D version in 2012. It has an 88 per cent rating on rottentomatoes.com, high praise from film critics, a notoriously fickle and flinty lot.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in a scene from the movie Titanic. ( PARAMOUNT PICTURES VIA THE ASSOCIATED PRESS )
At Oscar time, it tied two records, one for most nominations at 14, with All About Eve (1950), a really great film, and a second tie when it won 11 awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, matching Ben-Hur (1959). So why does this film leave me with a sinking feeling? My harp could go on and on ... If you haven't yet seen the film — you've been living in a cave, perhaps? — stop reading because there are spoilers a-coming.

But, besides the generally pedestrian plotting, here are some of the things that particularly rankled: Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins two tickets (third class, of course) aboard the ill-fated vessel in a poker game. Jack and their pal, Fabrizio, make it up the gangplank with mere moments to spare. A poker game, really? Hack-neyed! Jack makes friends with Rose (Kate Winslet) after they prevent them from jumping ship — literally — into the chill North Atlantic. Them fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, playing the villain with impeccable snideness) thanks Jack by inviting them for dinner with the first-class passengers. Jack is spared the embarrassment of having to decline when fellow passenger Molly Brown offers them a tuxedo that fits them like a glove. (Shirt and shoes too.) How serendipitous! When the boat finally goes down in spectacular fashion — one must give director James Cameron their due here — Rose and Jack have one last fateful, frost-filled conversation as they float on a piece of wreckage and they hang on the side. Couldn't they have scooched over a bit? Wouldn't climbing onto the floating wreckage with them and pressing their bodies together for warmth while they awaited uncertain rescue actually have made more sense? Finally, Rose — who narrates the story — has been invited aboard the research vessel, Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, by treasure hunter Brock Hunter where they recount their story of star-crossed love so many decades before. To finance the costly expedition, Hunter and company were hoping to recover the famed Heart of the Ocean diamond, which Cal gave Rose as an engagement present.
So what does the older Rose does in the film's final moments? They drop the rock into the deep, disregarding the needs of their benefactors and consigning a beautiful gem to the ignominy of the ocean floor sludge. What a centenarian ingrate! As great romance movies go, this one was for me more of a shipwreck than a dream boat.

Despite the repeal of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) in 2015, City officials are doubling down on their support for transgender equality.
Communications director Alan Bernstein confirmed to OutSmart that the City is now offering comprehensive trans-inclusive health benefits to municipal employees. Bernstein said the City added the benefits to comply with nondiscrimination provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Lou Weaver, transgender programs coordinator at Equality Texas and a former co-chair of Mayor Sylvester Turner's LGBTQ Advisory Board, called the addition of trans healthcare benefits for City employees a “huge win in Houston and in Texas.”
“As far as City employees go, no one's health is being excluded,” Weaver said. “This is a message that shows that the City of Houston is going to do everything that it can to take care of its trans employees. Whether these employees are current or future, they now know that the city sees them.”
Austin and Dallas are the only other Texas cities that offer comprehensive trans-inclusive health benefits to employees, according to the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).
HERO, which prohibited discrimination based on gender identity and expression, in addition to more than a dozen other characteristics, was approved by City Council in 2014. However, anti-LGBTQ groups used misleading anti-trans attack ads to convince voters to repeal the ordinance in November 2015.
Dave Welch, executive director of the Houston Area Pastor Council, which led the effort to repeal HERO, did not respond to phone messages from OutSmart about the city's trans health benefits.
Weaver said it is likely that some of the city's 23,000 employees are trans.
The coverage would dramatically lower out-of-pocket expenses for employees who want to transition—a process that can cost up to $50,000 for counseling sessions, hormone therapy, and gender-confirmation surgery, according to the Trans Road Map online guide. City officials will provide details about the benefits when medical providers or trans employees inquire, Bernstein said.
In 2001, San Francisco became the first city to offer health-insurance plans that covered medically necessary treatment for trans employees. The cost of covering the health needs of these employees proved to be relatively inexpensive compared to the other health needs of City workers.
According to a study conducted by UCLA's Williams Institute, two-thirds of private employers reported no cost increases associated with adding trans-inclusive health coverage. The other one-third reported an increase of one percent or less in total costs.
“Many trans people face a struggle finding trans-inclusive health care,” said Cathryn Oakley, HRC's state legislative director and senior counsel. “Most people get their health insurance through their employers. All of these employees deserve to access medically necessary treatments without facing discrimination.”
In 2016, under the Obama administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopted a rule stating that Section 1557 of the ACA prohibits anti-trans discrimination.
Eight states, led by Texas, joined religiously affiliated healthcare providers in filing a lawsuit challenging the rule. U.S. District Court judge Lee Rosenthal, of the Southern District of Texas, temporarily halted enforcement of the protections for trans patients in December 2016.
In response to Rosenthal's ruling, the Trump administration said it planned to modify the Section 1557 rule, but had not initiated any changes as of May 2018.
“If there is ever a pushback on the anti-discrimination portion of ACA, I hope that the City of Houston doesn't see transgender health benefits as no longer necessary because they are not recognized by law,” Oakley says. “Transgender-inclusive health benefits are absolutely medically necessary.”
For six years, HRC has compiled the Municipal Equality Index (MEI), which grades cities on LGBTQ inclusion based on their laws, policies, and services.
“The MEI is a to-do list,” Oakley says. “Cities that do not receive a perfect score can look at the index to see what they can do better.”
On the 2017 MEI, Houston received a score of 75 points out of 100. Oakley said the city lost six points because it did not provide information to HRC about trans-inclusive healthcare benefits. However, HRC hopes to revisit the trans healthcare category with the city prior to releasing its 2018 MEI, they said.

Stiglitz said the rise of populism in the United States came as a result of three factors: the growth of inequality, people's feeling that the ruling system is unfair, especially that the same persons who were directly responsible for the occurrence of the global financial crisis in 2008 were appointed to solve the crisis rather than be held accountable; and, finally, the loss of confidence in the elite layer of society.
Growing up, Ragina Saunders says their grandmother cooked with a supernatural pot.
"At my grandma's house, everyone could come. They had this pot that just kept stirring and they kept on getting scoops out, no matter how many people came with their kids, they kept on scooping out food, making up plates. I saw that growing up and the little things we take for granted and I saw how this world was going and how we need to keep this spirit alive. We're Charleston, we're hospitality. I still believe we're the Holy City."
Saunders opened pay-what-you-can Destiny Community Café in their family's Scott Grand Reception and Corporate Center building on Dorchester Road in Spring 2015. They had seen the need in their community, and heard about the nonprofit One World Everybody Eats, a program that helps food vendors open pay-what-you-can eateries. Destiny was the first cafe under this nonprofit in the state of South Carolina (Dellz on the Macon has since joined the roster). Since its inception, word has spread and Saunders is serving buffet-style lunch Mon.-Fri. to at least 50 people a day, carrying on the tradition of that supernatural giving pot. But serving healthy meals to customers who sometimes can only donate a few dollars, or their time, is not easy to sustain. And keeping up with the ever-growing city means costs are only rising.
"We've been growing, and the shopping center we're in, new people have been moving in, which has caused us to need to come up to that standard/scale. The first thing is the signage," says Saunders. The property's landlord let all the businesses know that they needed new large block signage (currently the cafe has a small, painted sign propped up out front) to match the bigger stores like Sav-A-Lot and Planet Fitness. Saunders says even though it will be pricey for their nonprofit, she's not complaining.
"It makes sense, and actually will make us much more visible. We're not complaining, we just need funding." Saunders posted on social media about the need for the new sign, which will cost the cafe upwards of $2,500. "I let customers know what we're up against. We've got a couple of companies that have given us other offers than what we were looking at. We're hoping that those meet approval, we need help. Everything is growing around us and the community wants us to stay."
The community Saunders serves is comprised of Charleston denizens who are disabled, don't have means of transportation, seniors, and people who can't afford organic healthy food, but more than that, can't afford to eat cheap, fried fast food every day. "We try to put out as much healthy food as possible. We have one guy who comes in and tells us their blood sugar level every day," laughs Saunders. "He's happy because we're cooking things they can eat on their diet restrictions. The food [we serve] is doing more than filling their bellies, it's healing."
The cafe's long list of needs includes a walk-in freezer (also close to $2,000) which they'll use to keep the fresh produce they receive from local growers from going bad. In addition to vegetable donations and non-perishable items, Saunders says a lot of the food they serve is purchased out of their own pocket. And renting out the banquet hall space on the weekends helps keep the lights on.
"Some days I say 'OK lord, I don't know how I'm going to feed 50 people with this little bit of money in my hands' and a volunteer will come and say 'let's make this.' Our motto is 'come to Destiny: pay what you can, we cook what we can.'"
Because they can only store and prep so much food at a time, the cafe doesn't have a set menu. But they do have an ambitious up-and-coming caterer and event planner working their magic in the kitchen. Terrence Freeman, owner of Charleston's Elite Event Planning, was quick to bring me slices of their homemade banana bread with bourbon caramelized bananas the moment I arrived. This is not the kind of fare you may expect at a pay-what-you-can cafe, but Saunders says there are lots of bright young people contributing their talent to the cause. "It's a good launching point, with the hands-on experience they'll get ... Terrence comes here early in the morning, he's so excited. They like to prep and organize and manage."
Freeman and other young volunteers are welcome faces for the seniors who, Saunders says, "come a lot." "They love interacting with young people, and a lot of the younger volunteers will teach the older people how to use their cellphones." Saunders points out one of their volunteers, Janie Jones, who shyly smiles when Saunders mentions their newly learned phone finesse. Saunders says that Jones — who is almost 90 — is about as close to a real life saint as you can get. "She will go find people at the bus stop, if they're hungry, need clothes or shelter, she'll pick people up and bring them here for lunch. On Sundays when we aren't busy they will come in and we'll do an assembly line and she'll take 30-40 dinners to homeless people."
It's people like Jones, and kind-hearted, down-on-their-luck strangers, who keep Saunders going, even as the pot looks like it may run dry. "A guy came in today, they were out of breath, like he'd been running to get here. We had 30 minutes before we closed, they said 'I heard about this place and they said I could volunteer and I'm here to volunteer because I don't have any money.' Someone was bringing in some bags and they got up to assist them immediately, it was nice they recognized right then that they could step in and help," says Saunders. "People still surprise me, even after three years. We're all so jaded, all this horrible stuff happening [in the world] 'how can people do this?' and then I'll come in here and you think gosh there really are good people. It gives me hope for the community."

The province is providing extra resources — “any support that is necessary” — in the aftermath of Monday's tragedy, said Premier Kathleen Wynne. Additional teams have been dispatched to aid in the identification of victims “in order to expedite that process, to move as quickly as possible to give families, who are desperate for information — more information — and to give it to them more quickly, because those hours of waiting are very, very painful.” Speaking outside their office at Queen's Park Tuesday morning, reading from four pages of handwritten notes, Wynne offered condolences to the families and friends of the victims “and the victims themselves who have survived, whose lives will never be the same. “Our hearts reach out (to them), and we desperately want to give them comfort.” They said Ontario Provincial Police are “in constant contact with the RCMP and Toronto Police Service officials” and the government is “consistently offering any support that is necessary.”

Wynne also expressed their “deepest admiration” to police, firefighters, paramedics and Sunnybrook staff for their efforts. The premier visited the the hospital as well as the site of the incident, on Yonge St. between Finch and Sheppard Aves., Monday night. “I had a hard time getting the pictures of a shoe, or a backpack out of my mind — those very human objects that people were wearing, and carrying, that were still on the street where they lay,” an emotional Wynne said of the scene. “I think the other thing was that the street was so silent,” they said of an area that is typically very busy and vibrant.
“The way Mel Lastman Square is designed — and I spent years as a school board trustee, at the school board (headquarters) there — there are always students, there's always a festival going on in Mel Lastman Square. There are people having lunch, going to movies; it is a very alive, diverse part of the city, and it was so silent.” Before Question Period, MPPs observed a moment of silence for the victims, and flags at the legislature were lowered to half-mast. When Progressive Conservative MPP Vic Fedeli rose to speak in the house, they noted the work of first responders, which prompted a standing ovation. “Our hearts ache for the families,” they said. NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, who was at the scene Tuesday morning, called it “incredibly emotional.” Wynne told reporters the emergency health teams at Sunnybrook prepare for tragedy “in the hope that it will never come. “And when it does, and when it did, and the calls were made (Monday) to off-duty nurses or off-duty personnel, they were already on their way; they knew exactly what had to be done.” They also thanked area residents and passersby who helped the injured, those who had a “hand in comforting souls.”
"We didn't have the ocean, so we put in erosion bunkers," said writer/architect Ron Whitten, who helped design Erin Hills.
They also designed a rolling, multi-sectioned green that, in places, is near-impossible to hold, along with a tee box on an exposed, wind-swept hill.
As is the case at Pebble Beach, where the seventh measures 109 yards, on most days the shot requires nothing more than a pitching wedge. But where No. 7 at Pebble Beach ranked as the third-easiest hole at the 2010 U.S. Open, No. 9 at Erin Hills is designed to cause more trouble than that.
"Honestly, there are a couple spots where you just do not want to be," said Garrett Osborn, a onetime regular on the Web.com Tour who qualified for their first U.S. Open this year.
No. 9 has been described — and we'll keep it just to the printable things — as the shortest par-5 in golf, the hole with the scariest second shot at Erin Hills (if you miss the green on the first) and, as Alex Noren of Sweden said, "a hole where there's no way you can just hit a decent shot to get on there, you have to hit a super-good shot to have a chance."
During their practice round Wednesday, Noren tried to simulate what happens if the shot is not "super good."
They randomly dropped a ball in one of the seven bunkers that surround the severely pitched green. They stepped in, leaned down and took a mighty hack. The ball stayed in. They leaned down again and got it out on the second try, then walked to the ball, picked it up, looked at it and threw it toward the stands. The ball had an inch-long gash just above the Callaway logo from their first failed attempt.
Not that avoiding the bunkers guarantees success. The middle of the putting surface pitches severely right and funnels downhill into a tightly mowed collection area that can leave a tricky flop shot for a second.
"Guys are going to get a little upset with that if the ball hits the middle of the green and it rolls all the way off the green and maybe 10 yards down into a chipping area," Steve Stricker said. "I think at some point that may need to get a little softened."
Rain might do that, but during summer in Wisconsin, rain almost always means wind, too, and picking a club while playing downhill with a helping or crossing wind will be hard.
Osborn said they expect more players than not to end up short of the green, in part because the bunkers that guard the back are tougher — filled with uneven lies, uneven distribution of sand and little dimples of scrub and turf that protrude into the traps themselves.
All part of the plan.
"You could have a side-hill lie, a lie that might be in one of those little fingers where you can't even get the club on the ball," Whitten said. "You might have a lie where you can't take the club back. You might have to turn sideways or turn backward.
"But if you were in the water, it'd be even worse."
No. 9 offers the most extreme example of the architects' philosophy across the course: Use the natural form of the land to turn bunkers back into hazards.
Have you ever looked into the faces of the players of a team that just won a championship? What about the losing team? It really brings home the idea that looking at the same situation from different sides can make a huge difference. I recently heard a story about a man who offered a homeless man a sandwich in lieu of money. When the homeless man refused him, they walked away mad. How dare the homeless person refuse their food. Obviously they only wanted the money to buy drugs. In that moment, they decided to U-turn their thought process and see things from another vantage point. So they walked back to the homeless man and asked them why they refused their food. The man said it was because they already had dinner for the night so they turned the sandwich down because they didn't want it to spoil and go to waste.
Robert Evans once said, “There are three sides to every story: your side, my side, and the truth. And no one is lying. Memories shared serve each differently.”
This is what we need to strive to remember in our everyday lives. So, when we are talking to someone who identifies as transgender, or republican, or Jewish, instead of pointing out obvious differences, what if we stopped to look for similarities? What if we took the time to understand why the other person feels and thinks the way they do? Notice I did not say that we should abandon our own beliefs and agree with the other person. I am simply saying that we should seek to acknowledge their beliefs. After all, at the core, we are all human beings seeking a higher purpose in this life.
Seeing things from a different vantage point can cause us to view the whole world through a different lens. Just like with a camera, when we change lenses, our focus changes and our world can become distorted. Suddenly views are no longer “wrong” or “right;” they just are. Someone else's views are no longer something we feel like we have to change, but a way to peer into their soul by listening with an open heart and mind. So, distort your world this week. Pretend that up is down, the sky is pink, and 1+1=11. The miraculous thing is that when you allow yourself to look through other lenses, you will see that all of these things can be true.
Abraham Lincoln once said, “We can complain because rose bushes have thorns, or rejoice because thorn bushes have roses.” I urge you to rejoice in the commonality of human beings and the opportunity to view the world through other's lenses.

Why Shifting World Cup Fandoms Doesn't Always Work Out What do you do when your home country's team doesn't make it into the World Cup? Commentator Mike Pesca digs into the perils of shifting support from team to team in the soccer tournament.
Ben McAdoo, whose Giants are 0-4 and whose employment status sure appears from the outside to be tenuous, has set about a plan to Make the Giants Great Again. They stopped the music.
McAdoo stressed, via the New York Post, that they didn't take away ALL the music from the team, and that there are ways for them to earn it back:
McAdoo said the deal is, “I did not eliminate the music from practice.'' But they did eliminate it from parts of practice. “During periods where there are fundamental emphasis and team emphasis as far as the scheme and getting the details right, we cut the music so our focus and concentration can go up,'' said McAdoo, who added the music is not gone for good.
With this leadership, how could the Giants not finish 11-1 and get into the playoffs?

Eli Manning has handled the pressure cooker of the New York market as well or better than perhaps any pro athlete we've ever seen, but even the Giants' 36-year-old quarterback can't really offer much advice to Odell Beckham Jr. on the perils of fame.
“I don't have a whole lot [of advice]. Obviously, [Beckham] is at a whole new level,” Manning cracked after Tuesday's minicamp practice.
Manning's fame centers mostly on their two Super Bowl championships and Hall of Fame caliber career, which makes them one of the most recognizable players in sports. Beckham has yet to win a playoff game, but that amazing one-handed catch in 2014 instantaneously catapulted them into the national spotlight and a level of fame and notoriety that has been boosted exponentially. Beckham's play, their temper, their choice of friends and a social media presence elevate them to celebrity status few have ever achieved.
Including Manning.
“I think for all the young guys, it takes a number of years to figure out what you need to do, how to handle things,” Manning said. “I was in the same position years ago and had to go through it, had to mature, had to realize things and understand how to handle everything that's thrown at you.”
Unlike Beckham, Manning's transformation into a public figure was seamless, even if it may not have felt that way to him. The son of a famous quarterback, Eli had watched Archie Manning deal with their own fame and applied those lessons to a modern-day career in New York. Beckham is now dealing with a level of attention rarely seen among public figures, no fewer sports figures.

They stayed away from the Giants' organized team activities and created a firestorm of controversy that they were somehow making a statement about wanting a new contract, because their $1.8 million salary for 2017 is far below market value. They were photographed with former Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel during their workouts on the West Coast — an unmistakably bad look for Beckham to be hanging out with a guy who has done everything wrong with their professional career. They did nothing to tamp down speculation that they were indeed unhappy with their contract, retweeting several people who had suggested their absence in the spring was all about the money.
But Beckham said their self-imposed exile had more to do with trying to find himself. They were h trying to do what general manager Jerry Reese so pointedly suggested the day after Beckham punched a hole in a wall outside the locker room after a playoff loss to the Packers in January: grow up.
The contract stuff will work itself out, and Beckham said he'd love to play their entire career in New York, echoing what team owner John Mara said last week at a fan forum. It's the maturity part that Beckhm is mostly concerned about.
“You just have time to be able to reflect on life and to be able to learn new things,” they said. “It was a great process for me and I definitely enjoyed it. Growth is something [that happens over] a lifetime. If you stop growing, you're not progressing in life. We all can grow each and every day.”
They talked about the lessons they learned from the popular self-help book “The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom.” Two of those lessons hit home.
Giants videos
“One of them is you really have to learn to use your words wisely and [another is] don't take anything personal,” they said. “It helps you grow and really mature into who you are as a person. I've gotten a couple of gray hairs, and I feel as if I'm a little wiser.”
Of course, we don't really know if Beckham has any gray hairs, because most of their hair is bleached blond. And we really won't know if Beckham has truly matured until they show it over the course of time. They sounded quite circumspect and settled as they spoke on Tuesday, and you get the sense they understand that they do need to carry themselves more responsibly.
A word of caution, though: Beckham has sounded this way before, only to repeat their controversial behavior. After their one-game suspension for launching themselves at Panthers cornerback Josh Norman late in the 2015 season, they talked about wanting to be a better example to kids. Then through much of the early part of the 2016 season, they acted out again, drawing penalties and fines for their on-field behavior.
And that punch-out of the wall at Lambeau came after a dreadful playoff effort, which came a week after what turned out to be an ill-fated decision to fly to south Florida and party with some teammates.
Reese and coach Ben McAdoo publicly chided Beckham for their outburst in Green Bay, and said they needed to grow up and be more accountable. Beckham then took some time away from the team to get their mind right, but only time will tell if they truly have.
Absentee Ballot Box Unveiled
Richland County, SC (WOLO) —Richland county voters now have a new option if they want to cast an absentee ballot.
Wednesday morning the Richland County Board of Elections unveiled an absentee ballot drop box.
Officials say it gives voters the chance to cast their ballots on their own schedule without using postage.
The ballot box was designed and installed by students at Heyward Career and Technology Center.
You will have access to the boxes until polls close at 7pm on election day.
A Singer, a songwriter, an actor, a theatre maker and fine storyteller, Catherine Ireton will bring their latest work to The Belltable in September.  They are excited to premier their new show in their hometown of Limerick.
Since leaving Limerick to study art at UCC, the Castletroy girl has toured the world with Scottish band Belle and Sebastian. Them theatre shows have toured all over the UK and Seoul, Hong Kong, Macau and Shanghai.
They have recorded seven albums and EPs and much of their recent work is produced by Farnham Maltings.
Catherine's new show is ‘For all the fires not yet lit'. It is a story of courage and explores what kind of courage it takes to just do the most mundane things in life. Catherine talked about it to Limerick Post this week.
“Today we are constantly told what to be fearful of – I wanted an antidote to that.”
“I wanted to examine the notion of quiet courage – not the hero, not the person who rescues the baby from the burning building – the person who doesn't recognise their own strengths in themselves – a conversation that you are dreading – a driving test – those everyday things.”
The story is told through dialogue and song. And Catherine is a gifted and natural storyteller as they bring us into the world of the character, Claire.
“She is a very timid woman. I tell them story. They wake the morning after their engagement party and has this awful sense of dread.”
Bride-to-be Claire is not going to make a speech at the wedding. She's not that type of person and none of their friends believe they would have the courage to speak in public.
Fighting through their hangover, Claire goes out to the shop to get some milk. They see a bus and just gets on the bus and goes on a 24 hour odyssey discovering what they are capable of and ends up in scrapes and adventures.
“It is about finding what your true courage is. I want to recognise the smallness of all our battles in the grand scheme of things.”
Catherine's piece is a solo performance of songs and heart exploring how everyday acts of courage can be as contagious as fear.
Continue reading below...
They like to examine one overall theme with every show. The show in Belltable premiering in September examines courage.
 They are currently working on a piece based on landscapes and songs in the Burren in Clare and their previous show ‘In Good Hands' looked at loneliness.
‘In Good Hands' is based in a hair salon in County Clare and has been performed everywhere from Ennis to Shanghai. It still tours regularly. It is a very funny and interactive piece that is performed by Claire and their co-star in real hair dressing salons to intimate audiences.
“The ritual of a haircut is the same wherever you go. We can become very swallowed in our individual lives and lose intimacy as we get more digital. But a hair salon is a place where you just sit back and someone is washing your hair. You are listening to conversations around you. We are always going to need hair salons – right?”
As well as performing in hair salons, Claire has brought their music and stories to pop-up gigs, festivals and railway stations.
“I not much interested in performing for theatre people if I'm honest. I am much more interested in performing for people who don't go the theatre. Doing shows in hair salons and places like that opens that up. It can be fun – it doesn't have to be cerebral. In most of my work I just try have a lot of heart in it and have people leave feeling better about the world.
‘For all the fires not yet lit' plays at the Belltable from Thursday September 28 to Saturday September 30.

The Belle and Sebastian years
The Belle & Sebastian single ‘The White Collar Boy' from 2006 featured Catherine Ireton on the front cover. The photo was taken by Stuart Murdoch, lead singer and songwriter for the band. Stuart's 2009 side project ‘God Help The Girl' was a story set to music that featured a group of female lead vocalists. The story revolved around a young girl called Eve who escapes from a mental health hospital and meets a young guitarist, down on their luck. Catherine Ireton was the voice of Eve and sang on the majority of tracks on the album. They toured with Murdoch extensively to promote the record. The film version featuring the songs from the record and a very young cast was eventually was released in 2014.

Proud papa Johnson poised to defend U.S. Open title

By Larry Fine
ERIN, Wisconsin (Reuters) - Unflappable Dustin Johnson, fresh from the birth of their second son on Monday, said they like their game and the Erin Hills layout ahead of defence of their U.S. Open title starting on Thursday.
Johnson's partner Paulina Gretzky and newborn River Jones Johnson are back home from the hospital in California and world number one Johnson is in rural Wisconsin focused on trying to become the first man since Curtis Strange in 1989 to repeat as U.S. Open champion.
Johnson arrived at Erin Hills on Tuesday afternoon, played some golf on the course, practiced on Wednesday morning, played nine holes and pronounced themselves ready to go.
"It's been very fun the last couple of days. Obviously having a new son on Monday was awesome," they said. "Everybody's healthy. Mom is healthy. The baby is healthy. So that's good.
"They just got home today, so that's exciting.
"She's a lot more comfortable," Johnson said about Paulina, "and everybody is healthy. Obviously that's a big relief, not having to worry about them.
"But now I've got to play golf. This is why I'm here. I'm here to play golf. I'm here to compete. So that's what my job is this week."
Offsetting their late arrival at Erin Hills, Johnson was able to get an early look at the course after missing the cut at the Memorial earlier this month.
At 7,741 yards from the back tips, the par-72 links-styled track will be the longest course to stage a U.S. Open and may favour big hitters even more since recent thunderstorms have dumped considerable rain on the rural layout.
"With the weather conditions we've had the last few days the course is really soft and going to play long," Johnson said. "I like the golf course. I think it sets up very well for me."
Johnson, one of golf's longest, most accurate players off the tee, was asked whether rivals might be intimidated going up against a power-hitting world number one and defending champion on the longest U.S. Open course ever.
"I hope so, they said. "Shouldn't it?"

Bucks rookie Thon Maker battles Raptors big man Jonas Valanciunas under the rim in Game 1 at the Air Canada Centre. Rick Madonik / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
Rick Carlisle, the Dallas Mavericks coach, was pumping the tires of Milwaukee's Jason Kidd before a game late in the NBA regular season, trying to drum up support for Kidd as the coach of the year. Carlisle — an astute observer of the game, an accomplished and underrated coach with a unique perspective on what it takes to do the job — pointed to Kidd's handling of raw 20-year-old Thon Maker as an example. “Early on they were young and kind of deer in headlights like most of these guys are, but Jason has stuck with them and now he's another of those guys that can switch ball screens and make shots and they can drive –— he's a very difficult matchup,” Carlisle said. “Everyone was looking at those wacky scouting films from some weird prep school in Canada, or wherever they are, and no one was really sure what to make of it all. But Jason made a good call drafting him. He's going to perform well above their draft position.” Maker's path to their current spot as a starter for the Bucks in their first-round series with the Toronto Raptors has unquestionably been unconventional.

The “weird prep school” was Orangeville's Athlete Institute — the third in four years for Maker, a South Sudan-born, Australian-raised, prep school standout in the United States and then Ontario. The draft position, 10th overall, was a bit of a head-scratcher. Taking a flier on an intriguing player with no experience, with not much of a background but a body type that might suit the NBA, is not unusual late in the draft. But a top-10 pick is rarely gambled with.
The Bucks took some heat from the “experts,” but it's paid off. Maker gives them another long, active defender to go with Giannis Antetokounmpo in protecting the rim. Give the Bucks credit for patience, too, for bringing them along slowly. Maker barely played early in the season, a total of 100 minutes after 41 games, but has been a starter since late January and blossomed. “It's crazy what a difference a year makes,” Maker told reporters in Milwaukee. “Just trusting in God and just working, staying with the process every single day and that's what happens.” He's not an integral part of what the Bucks do offensively, but he's seven-foot-one and long and disruptive on defence, which fits perfectly with Milwaukee's style. They went basically unnoticed early in Game 1, but had two blocked shots and a basket early in the third quarter that helped change the momentum. “I was a little bit all over the place, trying to figure out what they were running,” Maker said. “But in the second half I already knew what they were into, so I had to just go a little bit harder and be more aggressive.” Going hard is what has allowed Kidd to playmaker as a starter in crucial games. They may not have fully developed skills or experience, but they go full-out all the time and their impact on games is subtle but vital. “He covered the rim (Saturday) night pretty well in the second half. They run the floor really well, and he's really good in that scheme,” Raptor P.J. Tucker said. “I think they spaced the floor. We've seen them make shots, so he's been pretty versatile for them. He's won that spot with them, so we've got to respect them and he's somebody we definitely have to take out.” To Carlisle's point, Kidd has done an excellent job bringing rookies along slowly and getting them to contribute when games matter the most. Point guard Malcolm Brogdon, a second-round pick who began the season as a backup to Matthew Dellavedova, had 16 points in Game 1 and has made a seamless jump from rookie second-stringer to starter. “Jason Kidd has all their young guys not playing like rookies,” Tucker said. “Brogdon, (Maker), they all come in and they play like they've played in the playoffs for years. It's amazing how hard he's got those guys playing.”

Johannesburg: Arcelor Mittal South Africa, the embattled subsidiary of Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal's global steel empire, may get a lifeline from its empowerment partner Likamva Resources which is willing to increase its stake in Africa's biggest steel producer.
Arcelor Mittal South Africa (AMSA), born out of Mittal's buyout of state steel manufacturer Iscor more than a decade ago after the steel magnate first rescued it from total collapse, last made a profit seven years ago. After a peak in the middle of 2008, AMSA's share price has seen a 98% drop. Even though AMSA produces about 70% of South Africa's steel, the current recession in the country as well as cheaper Chinese imports have seen it take a battering.
Last year, there was urgent government intervention after Mittal's threatened closure of one of its plants put the lives of the entire town of Vanderbijlpark, south of Johannesburg, in jeopardy through unemployment. Now AMSA's Black economic empowerment partner Likamva Resources (LR) says it is willing to increase its 17% stake in Africa's biggest steel producer despite its loss- making record, the weekly Sunday Times reported.
Noluthando Gosa, a partner at LR, told the weekly that if resources and funds permitted it, the company would inject the capital needed to help AMSA. But any changes in this increased shareholding would have to be sanctioned by the company's London-based parent. Amid speculation about a possible sell-off, AMSA remained optimistic about its prospects in the face of these challenges.
“Several initiatives are under review by AMSA's executive team to improve the company's performance,” an AMSA spokesperson said. Analysts appeared to concur that it would not be viable to sell AMSA.
Wade Napier at Avior Capital Markets gave two reasons for this – the hard work Mittal had done in securing an operating licence in South Africa; and the fact that any sale was likely to involve a significant discount demand.
Makwe Masilela at BP Bernstein suggested that AMSA might just need to sell off parts of its business and secure the support of the government. Such support has already come in the form of safeguard duties on imports, due to be implemented in the second half of this year, which AMSA is banking on to help grow its earnings. PTI

They add that the university reached out to Facebook and asked them to remove the event page, but has not received a response.
The Toronto Nationalist Rally, according to its event page, is scheduled for Sept. 14.
It is hosted by the Canadian Nationalist Party, a political organization that claims to support ethnic nationalism.
Forget, just for a day, the struggle to get kids to eat peas or broccoli. There'll be no arguing with the kids when it comes to these food offerings, from “rolled” ice cream to customized doughnuts to milkshakes with a Pop-Tart sticking out of the top. Here are eight food excursions for families, including one to Hmart in Jericho, where it's possible the kids might choose something healthful.
Doughology 45 Atlantic Ave., Lynbrook; 516-341-0882, facebook.com/doughologydonuts
Kids create customized doughnuts at Doughology. “We handle the doughnuts behind the register,” says co-owner Jackie Stiansen, a former stockbroker who opened the store with their husband, a retired New York Police Department detective. Kids first pick a vanilla or chocolate doughnut. Then they choose from eight flavors of icing, including vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, caramel, lemon and more. Lastly, they add three choices from a toppings bar that includes sprinkles, M & M's, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, Fruity Pebbles and more. “There are about 16 to 20 toppings and you create your own masterpiece of a doughnut,” Stiansen says. Customized doughnuts are $2.50 each.

Though it's only the first preseason game, injury issues are already reappearing this year.
The Chargers lost rookie guard Forrest Lamp to a season-ending injury and are hoping the situation isn't the same with Attaochu or Perryman.
Attaochu only played in eight games last season, but their most-productive year came in 2015 when they recorded 55 tackles, six sacks and nine run stops in 15 games.
UPDATE: The team ruled Attochu officially OUT of the game early on in the third quarter.
President Park Geun-hye (Yonhap)
The year 2017 faces a number of political bumps, such as the investigation into President Park Geun-Hye's corruption charges, a court judgment on their impeachment, and a plausibly earlier-than-planned presidential election -- all stemming from the so-called Choi Soon-sil scandal which rocked the nation late last year.Tension will be particularly high during the first quarter when it becomes more clear whether the government will hold out or face a drastic end.President Park, whose power would have weakened gradually until the election of a successor, is now facing a premature end to their presidency -- followed by possible criminal sanctions -- over the corruption allegations.Instead of mapping out a presidential campaign with former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the ruling Saenuri Party is reeling under an unprecedented party division which is likely to split conservative votes in the forthcoming election.Meanwhile, all political scenarios rest upon whether the Constitutional Court will uphold the impeachment resolution of President Park -- which is to officially end the suspended president's term and give way to the next election.It is the Constitutional Court's ruling, deciding whether or not to oust the state chief as requested by the legislature, which holds the key to all future political road maps.The top court is to hold argument proceedings running from this week until next week in order to give the floor to both sides -- the legislative impeachment committee as plaintiff and President Park as defendant.The given case includes five issues: whether Park violated the rule of law by covertly letting their civilian aide meddle in key state affairs, abused their power as president, infringed on the media's freedom of speech, neglected their duty as state leader to protect the people's lives and received bribes from conglomerates.The court is to give its ruling by early June at the latest, which will be six months away from the submission of the impeachment resolution, but has signaled that it will speed up the processes so as to minimize the state affairs vacuum.It not only reduced the grounds for impeachment from the original 13 to five, but also rejected the legislature's call to summon Park for face-to-face questioning, in apparent fear of wasting time on hoping for their unlikely attendance.While the majority are speculating the court decision to come out in February, some radical observers argue that it may be moved forward to late January, considering that Chief Justice Park Han-chul's term is to end on Jan. 31.“The Constitutional Court will hurry on its moves as it has clearly perceived the president's power suspension as a crisis in the nation's constitutional order,” said Han Sang-hee, professor of law at Konkuk University's Graduate School of Law.The Constitution states that a presidential election should be held within 60 days from the court‘s impeachment decision.While the probe by the special prosecutor exerts no direct influence on Park's ouster, it is nevertheless a key indicator which may affect the decision of the Constitutional Court.The special probe team, led by chief investigator Park Young-soo, has started digging into the five key allegations which constitute Park's impeachment trial, focusing especially on their bribery charges.The core suspicion is whether the president acted as junction in the nation's top conglomerate Samsung Group's financial support for Chung Yoo-ra, equestrian and daughter of presidential confidante Choi Soon-sil, so as to iron out the difficulties in its power succession plan.Following the news on Monday that Chung was arrested in Denmark, the special probe team said that it is communicating with the Danish government to have the key witness repatriated back home.The tenacious investigation into the Park-Samsung connection apparently put pressure upon the suspended president, pushing them to make an unexpected New Year's Day press conference on Sunday, breaking their long silence since their impeachment bill was passed on Dec. 9.“Rumors, stories, and broadcasts have been distorted, and false information has been getting out of hand,” they said during a meeting with reporters at Cheong Wa Dae.But their self-defensive remarks, which came amid the special prosecutor's accelerating chase over the Samsung-related allegations, were largely deemed a hurried action to hold back the probe.The final decision on Park‘s impeachment, should the top court uphold it, will leave presidential candidates with less than two months to campaign for the top office.This lack of time was previously thought to be in favor of Moon Jae-in, frontrunner of the main opposition Democratic Party, especially as former UN official Ban's approval rating had faltered upon the incumbent administration‘s scandal.But key polls have been showing recently that the two frontrunners were still in a neck-and-neck race, with some runner-up candidates continuing to map their way into the list.A survey by pollster Realmeter showed Monday that in the last week of December, Ban held 23.5 percent of the respondents' approval, beating Moon by 0.5 percentage points.But another survey conducted by Korea Research, Yonhap News Agency and KBS showed Moon to be in the lead, with a 21.6 percent approval rating, 4.4 percentage points higher than Ban.Experts pointed out that the stalemate in approval ratings, especially in that of Moon, was attributable to the public disappointment in politics.“The people want change and have made this clear through the candlelight rallies and other protests,” said Realmeter Ceo Lee Taek-soo.“But the conventional politicians have failed to live up to such expectations, which led to a stagnation in polls.”By Bae Hyun-jung (tellme@heraldcorp.com)
OTTAWA—Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered condolences to the victims of Monday's “senseless attack and horrific tragedy” and said it will prompt reviews on how to better protect Canadians from such incidents in the future. A subdued Trudeau addressed reporters in the Commons' foyer Tuesday morning, offering comfort for those affected by the incident, praise for those who responded while acknowledging the many questions that still exist. “On behalf of all Canadians I offer my deepest heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of all those who were killed and we wish a full recovery to those injured and stand with the families and friends of the victims,” Trudeau said. The prime minister also singled out emergency personnel who responded for handling an “extremely difficult situation with professionalism and bravery.” “They faced danger without a moment of hesitation and there is no doubt their courage saved lives and prevented further injuries,” they said.

“But right now, it's very much an active ongoing situation and I wouldn't want to distract or remove any personnel or focus away from the important work that is being done,” they said. They said Canada's biggest city has shown “strength and determination” and that all Canadians “stand united” with Toronto today.

They said there are many unanswered questions but repeated the statement by Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale that officials have no reason to suspect a national security motive was behind it. “Obviously all Canadians . . . will continue to have questions about why this happened, what could possibly be the motive behind it,” Trudeau said. “At this time we have no reason to suspect there is a national security element to this attack. But obviously the investigation continues,” they said. They underscored what they called the “excellent collaboration” among governments and law enforcement agencies. “We're continuing to monitor this closely.” They referred to the incident as an “attack” and said it would prompt discussions about “what we can do better, what we need to do.” “Obviously we need to reflect on the change situations in which we're in and do everything we can to keep Canadians safe but we cannot as Canadians choose to live in fear every single day as we go about our daily business,” Trudeau said. “We need to focus on doing what we can . . . to keep Canadians safe while we stay true to the freedoms and values that we all as Canadians hold dear,” they said. “We are pulling together and trying to find answers while keeping people safe,” Trudeau said.

3 Major Deals Point To A Maturing, And Global, Music Startup Landscape
Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg via Getty Images
Three deals of acquisitions and investments that were rumored over the past week, and that are all now confirmed, have something in common — none of them involve companies owned by major record labels. All involve technology companies or insurrectionists to entrenched industry leaders. One noted below, Tencent, holds such power in its home country that all three major labels agreed to let it broker their deals in that country. Another, Spotify, has for better and worse come to define the modern era of music listening, helping establish new habits for music fans that have led to a strong new revenue stream for the classic music business (but not yet for Spotify itself).
All point to a music industry both in repair and reconfiguration.
SONGS And Kobalt
SONGS, a successful and scrappy independent music publishing company founded in 2004 by a former hardcore guitarist and Columbia business grad, has been acquired by another outsider-led firm, Kobalt Capital, the acquisition division of Kobalt Music Group. The price tag for SONGS wasn't disclosed, but is reported to be around $160 million.
Matt Pincus, the founder and CEO of SONGS, approached the music publishing business — the administration and exploitation of song compositions and the songwriters behind them, not recorded pieces of music — with a grassroots approach, preferring initially to signing promising artists to extensive contracts over acquiring song catalogs of known quality and revenue. The firm attracted little attention for its first several years from the established music business — no articles in the trade publication Billboard, and only a wedding notice in The New York Times. Several high-profile deals struck in the midst of heavy competition — foremost those involving Lorde, The Weeknd and Diplo, all brokered by founding A&R member and now-departing president Ron Perry, who will soon lead Columbia Records — put the company on the map around 2013.
"That the result of our work is a catalog we created writer by writer and song by song, representing a decade of popular music in all formats — including many of tomorrow's evergreens — is a testament to our approach," Pincus says, in a release on the news. Not long after, it began working with the estate of George Gershwin. (It still maintains its ground-up approach, recently signing the maligned SoundCloud rapper XXXTentacion to a global deal.)
The buyer of SONGS, Kobalt, is another (relatively) new music company emblematic of fundamental shifts and new approaches within an industry long dominated by an entrenched executive class. Its Swedish founder, Willard Ahdritz, founded the company in 2000 intending to take a strict, technological approach to the song business. The company eventually debuted a tool which allows artists, regardless of their stature, to track listening of their work worldwide — to show who is playing which song, where, in real time across 900,000 possible sources of income. It was the first to offer such granular tracking information to anyone willing to pay. (Record labels, other music publishers and label services companies all have similar tools available to their rosters, but those tools' availability and granularity vary.) Along the way to establishing their company, which has seen revenues increase while still operating at a loss, Ahdritz was often antagonistic towards their established competitors.
"It's important to remember that the [major labels] were structured to control distribution and marketing in the old world ruled by radio," they told Billboard two years ago. "Things have changed, and I expect the industry structure will change as well. It has to adapt in order to survive." As Moby, a client of the company, told The New York Times: "Kobalt is more like a tech company than a music company. As a result, no one ever told them to steal from their artists."
Apple Buys Identifier App Shazam
"I'm gonna Shazam it," is something you now hear often, usually right before someone you know starts holding a smartphone aloft, microphone skyward. Shazam's name has long held the coveted also-a-verb status, which it has earned by developing one of the most robust song-identifying technologies in the world. The company was founded in 2002 as a phone call-in service.
Now, in a deal confirmed today, Apple will own that experience. "We are thrilled that Shazam and its talented team will be joining Apple," the company wrote in a statement provided to NPR. "Apple Music and Shazam are a natural fit, sharing a passion for music discovery and delivering great music experiences to our users. We have exciting plans in store, and we look forward to combining with Shazam upon approval of today's agreement."
The sale, first reported by TechCrunch, is estimated to carry a price tag of $400 million, far less than the $1 billion it was estimated to be worth two years ago. After a shift to advertising, it claimed to have generated a profit for the first time.
Apple will likely use the company's technology to augment Apple Music, its music streaming service and the primary competitor to market leader Spotify. Even back when it was Beats Music, the platform was highly reliant on human curation, employing 100 people to create playlists for it. "Right now, there are only mathematical solutions," Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine told a tech conference in 2013.
Spotify And Tencent
Meanwhile Spotify and Tencent, a leading Chinese media company which also brokers the major labels' fortunes in that country, announced a mutual investment late last week. While details weren't given, the deal was reportedly for 10 percent for each when the news was broken by The Wall Street Journal the week prior.
The partnership is unprecedented in the music streaming space, where more often than not — as was the case with Pandora's acquisition of Rdio — companies purchase each other wholesale. In the case of Spotify and Tencent, the latter could easily afford to purchase Spotify outright. This structure instead would ostensibly allow each to benefit from the other's specialties. Spotify is a market leader outside of China, while Tencent largely holds the keys to enter the country's digital music business.

Kansans should consider the following ideas to assist with the claims process.
Know your policy. Understand what your policy says. Because it is a contract between you and your insurance company, you need to know what's covered, what's not and what your deductibles are.
File claims as soon as possible. Don't let the bills or receipts pile up. Call your agent or your company's claims hotline as soon as possible. Your policy might require that you make the notification within a certain time frame.
Provide complete, correct information. Be certain to give your insurance company all the necessary information. If your information is incorrect or incomplete, your claim could be delayed.
Keep copies of all communications. Whenever you communicate with your insurance company, be sure to document the communications. With phone calls, include the date, name and title of the person you spoke with and what was said.
Ask questions. If there is a disagreement about the claim settlement, ask the company for the specific language in your policy that is in question. Find out if the disagreement is because you interpret the policy differently. If your claim is denied, make sure you have a letter from the company explaining the reason for the denial — including the specific policy language which caused the denial.
Don't rush into a settlement. If the first offer your insurance company makes does not meet your expectations, talk with your local insurance agent or seek other professional advice.
Document auto/homeowners temporary repairs. Auto and homeowners policies might require you to make temporary repairs to protect your property from further damage. Document any damaged personal property for an adjuster to inspect. If possible, take photographs or videotape the damage before making the repairs. Your policy should cover the cost of these temporary repairs, so keep all receipts.
Don't make permanent repairs. A company might deny a claim if you make permanent repairs before the damage is inspected. If possible, determine what it will cost to repair your property before you meet with an adjuster. Provide the adjuster any records of improvements you made to the property, and ask him/her for an itemized explanation of the claim settlement offer.
Seek accident and health claims details. Ask your medical provider to give your insurance company details about your treatment, condition and prognosis. If you suspect your provider is overcharging, ask the insurance company to audit the bill, and verify whether the provider used the proper billing procedure.
Contact the Kansas Insurance Department (KID). If you continue to have a dispute with your insurance company about the amount or terms of the claims settlement, contact the KID Consumer Assistance Hotline at 1-800-432-2484, or go to the website, www.ksinsurance.org, to use the Chat feature
You can get a claim resolved quicker if you have the consumer know-how to fast track the process.
Although Season 4 of Outlander hasn't started airing yet, production for Season 5 has already begun. At PaleyFest in Los Angeles on Sunday, producer Ronald D. Moore told TVGuide.com, "We are deep into planning for Season 5 even though it's not officially picked up."
Starz has yet to officially renew the show for Season 5, but CEO Chris Albrecht revealed back in January that Seasons 5 and 6 were all but confirmed. "There are ten books, and we are having very productive conversations about the future of the show," they said at the Television Critics Association Press Tour.

Moore is positive the series will return for a fifth season, telling Entertainment Weekly, "We are certainly going to do it. I have no doubt we are doing a season 5.”
Filming for Season 4 is currently underway, with new episodes expected to premiere on Starz sometime in the fall. It might seem a little early to start production on a fifth season, but production designer Jon Gary Steele says this early planning is necessary.

"Normally, halfway through [the current season] we start researching and prepping [for the next season]," Steele told TVGuide.com. "But we're so busy this year [with Season 4], it's really a big year. It's my biggest build so far. It's huge. It might be the best-looking year of all."
Currently, the show follows a book a season, although Moore hints that it might change in the future. “Every year we approach it fresh. Should we keep it a book a season? We've done that up until now," they told Entertainment Weekly. "But we've talked about splitting books, and we've talked about combining them. We want to be free in the writers' room to pick and choose and do what feels most comfortable that year.”
Season 5 of Outlander will likely be partially based on Diana Gabaldon's fifth book in the Outlander series, The Fiery Cross. Buy it here

It is frightening to me that these three cops may be reinstated as police officers in Toronto or anywhere else. Their behaviour that night was reprehensible.
These three cops have tarnished the reputation of all officers on the force. Their behaviour will have a disastrous effect on how the people of Toronto feel about their police. People will be even less likely to trust the police, help them solve crimes or co-operate with them.
I truly believe the majority of Toronto police officers are good, and must be ashamed and disgusted to have these three men on the force. It is very good news that senior officers have been told to inform all officers that even when off duty, officers must adhere to the core values of integrity, honour and trustworthiness.

The alarming levels of public and private debt are back at the global centre stage. It was only 10 years ago, a debt-driven growth model caused the worst financial crisis since the great depression in the 1930s. Despite grand claims of the end of “boom and bust” by then British chancellor Gordon Brown, and heralding the “Great Moderation” by Ben Bernanke, the former US Federal Reserve chairperson, the modern day financial sorcerers who control the Wall Street brought untold misery on almost every country. Such is the scale of wreckage that it is “still with us almost a decade later,” says Yanis Varoufakis, a former Greek finance minister, in their book Adults in the Room- My Battle with Europe's Deep Establishment.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rang alarm bells at its spring meetings on the ticking debt-time bomb. “The world's $164 trillion debt pile is bigger than at the height of the financial crisis a decade ago,” the IMF has warned, according to a news report in Financial Times on 18 April. It urged private and public sectors to cut debt levels for reinvigorating the economic growth. “Fiscal stimulus to support demand is no longer the priority,” the IMF said.
Finance ministers and central bank governors from around the world also expressed concerns over the escalating number of trade disputes launched by the US. But, the US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin blamed countries running persistent trade surpluses for the growing trade tensions.
Coming back to the dangerous debt levels, it is well established and also acknowledged by the IMF that lax fiscal policies, particularly by Washington, are at the heart of the problem. Six major industrialized countries—the US, Japan, France, Britain, Italy, and Canada—have increased their gross liabilities as percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 105%, 221%, 124%, 121%, 157% and 97%, respectively.
Ahead of the IMF meeting, two former senior officials of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)—Herve Hannoun, a former deputy general manager, and Peter Dittus, former secretary-general—issued a scary report called Revolution Required - the Ticking Time Bombs of the G7 Model.
Presenting their findings at a meeting convened by the Geneva-based South Centre, which was set up by former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh, the two former BIS officials have pronounced unambiguously that “the current economic model built on unsustainable growth of debt, asset prices inflation, arms race, and unsustainable use of carbon will come to an end.”
Since 1971, when President Richard Nixon unilaterally ended the direct international convertibility of the American dollar to gold, the US continued to enjoy the “exorbitant privilege” (of printing its currency and paying other nations for goods and services bought from them). That it has become the epicentre for the unsustainable monetary policies without any concern for its ballooning twin deficits is well established.
The US, in turn, exported all its failures to curb the “twin deficits” (fiscal and current account deficits) to other G7 countries, which followed the US model, except Germany. “The US administration multiplies new expenditure and tax cuts by trillion dollars, with no funding other than more debt” which includes $1.5 trillion tax bonanza for the big corporates, $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan, colossal increase in the Pentagon budget by more than $700 billion. Unfortunately, other G7 countries kept mum about this dangerous “opening of the flood gates.”
But, the party goes on despite “the reckless behaviour” of the US whose fiscal deficit is projected around $1 trillion in 2019. Of course, this would not be possible without the permissive monetary policy conducted by the US Federal Reserve (the American central bank) since 2009. “The silence or complacency of the Big Three US-based rating agencies (Standard and Poor, Moody's, and Fitch group), with the blessing of the International Monetary Fund,” exposes the hypocrisy of the watchdogs.
Indeed, the G7 central banks “have become the facilitators of unfettered debt accumulation” at “near zero or negative nominal interest rates.” Such low interest rates remain the price of leverage in an economy with the main beneficiaries being “non-bank corporations” who buy back their own shares, thereby increasing “leverage and deteriorating deliberately their gearing ratios to please their shareholders.”
Small wonder that the total debt of the seven major developed countries is estimated at around $100 trillion in the third quarter last year. Of the total world debt, the US, Britain, Canada, Japan, and the eurozone account for 64%. The extreme fundamentalist monetary policies followed by the seven developed countries since 2012 have undermined “the foundations of the market economy.”
The eminent former governor of the Reserve Bank of India Yaga Venugopal Reddy who navigated India out of the 2008 financial crisis with aplomb has largely concurred with the findings of Hannoun and Dittus. Reddy called for rebalancing on several fronts: “rebalancing has to be between national and global economy, state and market, finance and real.” At a time when the G7 monetary policy is captured by financial markets and regulatory policies are framed by large banks and financial industry, the world is truly in the brutal grip of financial sorcerers. But can they control “the powers of the nether world” this time around?
You probably know that probiotics are reported to help your body out in tons of different ways — from better digestion and increased immune function, to improved absorption of nutrients, probiotics arecan be powerful little bacteria that can up the beneficial flora in your gut, and crowd the bad bugs out; essentially helping you build a healthy and flourishing internal ecosystem. Now, new research also suggests that probiotics can do even more than help you build a better gut: they might also help protect your liver from drug and alcohol induced damage, Men's Health reported.
As the body's largest internal organ, the liver performs over 500 functions to keep us alive and kicking every day. It's mostly known for filtering what we consume, figuring out what to store as energy and what toxins or other extraneous material to strain out. The liver is also a key player in converting food into energy. Being “‘downstream' of the gastrointestinal tract in the digestive process, it makes sense that the composition of bacteria in the gut could affect the functioning of the liver,” according to a recent press release.
Inspired by studies linking probiotics to better brain and heart health, researchers from Emory University were curious as to whether probiotics could also help protect the liver. So they decided to look at whether a common probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or LGG, could help protect this amazingly important organ against damage.
Here's how it all went down: the researchers gave two sets of mice a diet high in LGG or a normal diet. Then, after two weeks, they gave the mice high doses of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in many pain-relief drugs that can help combat acute inflammation, but that can also cause free radicals — which can damage your liver. Basically, the mice that had had an LGG-rich diet had an improved "antioxidant response of the liver, protecting it from oxidative damage produced by drugs such as acetaminophen," lead study author Bejan Saeedi, a doctoral candidate at Emory, explained in the press release.
“Probiotics have been studied most intensely in the context of the gastrointestinal tract,” Saeedi said, but current research shows that “the effects of probiotics extend beyond the gastrointestinal tract. What makes this study unique is that it suggests a discreet molecular mechanism by which these effects are elicited.”
As it turns out, taking too much acetaminophen can really mess up your liver. Overuse of acetaminophen can cause major liver damage, or even death, by increasing free radicals in the body — causing severe oxidative stress, the press release further states. Earlier research by Saeedi's colleagues has identified the process by which LGG shields the liver from oxidative stress induced injury. The current study shows that the protein Nrf2, which regulates the expression of genes in the fight against free radicals, plays a pivotal role in protecting the liver against oxidative damage and injury. Saeedi explained that while the effects of LGG on mice look promising, the little critters are clearly not human — so further studies are needed to see if the results of this research can be replicated in human subjects.
These findings are pretty exciting, however, even though further research needs to be done. While you probably already knew what probiotics could do for your gut health, it looks like they could be a pretty powerful protective measure for your liver, too — and who knows what other body systems are next. So while probiotics are definitely not a substitute for medicine if you're worried about your liver's filtration abilities, and you should still consult a doctor before incorporating a new supplement into your regimen, it looks like the benefits of probiotics extend far beyond what was previously thought.
A second-half blitz saw Peterborough United succumb 3-2 at home to a stylish Blackburn Rovers side.
Posh went into the break 1-0 up after Steven Taylor headed in Marcus Maddison's corner, but the match was turned on its head 13 minutes after the break as Charlie Mulgrew and a Bradley Dack double put Rovers 3-1 ahead.

Jack Marriott tapped in their 15th goal of the season in injury time, but moments late captain Jack Baldwin was sent off for a second yellow card after bringing down Dack.
The result means play-off chasing Posh have won just once in their last six league matches, although they will come up against few sides as good as this Blackburn one, which has now won five league matches in a row thanks in part to Mulgrew's fifth goal in four games.
The home side made two changes to the team which beat Southend 2-0 in the EFL Trophy, as Leo Da Silva Lopes failed a late fitness test, while Alex Penny was dropped to the bench.
In their place came Anthony Grant and Steven Taylor.

Any latecomers to the match would have been sorely disappointed as both sides attacked from the opening whistle.
Baldwin playing at right-back was booked in just the third minute for bringing down Craig Conway, and the resulting free-kick came out to Richie Smallwood whose cross from the right was headed over by Dominic Samuel who should have scored.
Marriott shot over at the other end, but it was Rovers who looked most likely to take the lead. First Dack volleyed wide from Samuel's chest down, then the attacking midfielder forced a good save from Bond with a shot.
The rebound came out to Dack but their close range effort was blocked by a combination of Bond and Baldwin.

From the corner Posh broke through Anthony Grant, with Maddison winning a corner down the right. The winger took the set-piece which they sent to the far post where Taylor was there to head in from just a few yards out.
The game settled down after the goal, with neither side fashioning a clear opening for the rest of the half.
Chris Forrester, who was one of three central midfielders for Posh in a 4-3-3 formation, was excellent in the first-half, and they played their part in a delightful passing move which started from the right-back position and ended with Marriott firing over from 25 yards.
Grant was also impressing again, and they won a free-kick 25 yards out which Maddison hit too close to Rovers goalkeeper David Raya.
Rovers' top scorer Marcus Antonsson was then booked for diving after falling over easily inside the area, but the away side continued to threaten through Dack whose movement forced some good defending from the Posh back four.
The last chance before the break fell to Gwion Edwards who stylishly controlled a Baldwin pass before shooting wide from 25 yards.
The second-half began with a minute's applause for Posh fan Andy Mills, the 46-year-old who recently died from a brain tumour.
But the applause was soon ringing out in the away end as Rovers turned the match around in three minutes.
In the 48th minute Mulgrew was left unmarked at the back post to tap in Conway's corner, then after Forrester lost the ball in their own half, Dack played a quick one-two with Smallwood before firing past Bond.
Ten minutes later and the match was as good as over. A Posh corner went to the back post where Taylor lost the ball, then a rapid break saw Samuel spread the play to Antonsson who teed up Dack to score again.
Grant McCann brought on Danny Lloyd for Jermaine Anderson, then Michael Doughty for Forrester, but it was Rovers who looked most likely to score next as Dack's dazzling feet brought the ball to Antonsson whose curling shot from the left was expertly saved by a diving Bond.
Posh tried to get back into the match and after a scramble in the Blackburn area Lloyd went down after appearing to be tripped, but nothing was given.
Matters got worse for Posh as Grant went down and a stretcher came out, but thankfully they were able to hobble off with Idris Kanu taking their place.
With just a few minutes left Posh created their best chances of the second-half. First Edwards hung up a cross from the right which Lloyd headed over, then from the opposite flank Maddison fired over an excellent cross which Marriott headed straight at Raya.
And then in the fourth minute of stoppage time Lloyd squared the ball to Marriott to tap in.
But Baldwin was then sent off for a second yellow card after bringing down Dack as Blackburn saw out the final few seconds.

SPRINGFIELD -- The Connecticut River Walk and Bikeway reopened Friday after being partially closed for more than two years as a result of a prolonged, complicated sewer project.
The Springfield Water and Sewer Commission announced the completion of the main interceptor sewer rehabilitation project and the reopening of the 3.7-mile path along the banks of the Connecticut River.
"We wish to thank our customers and all Connecticut River Walk users for their patience and understanding during this complicated but incredibly important project," said Josh Schimmel, executive director of the commission.
"We encountered many unexpected conditions and delays that required us to extend project work much longer than anticipated, but we are very proud of the final result that will help to provide reliable sewer service to our customers for decades to come," Schimmel said.
The sewer project involved rehabilitating 3,200 feet of 60- and 66-inch diameter sewer pipe and associated manholes, and the repair of three combined sewer overflow outfall structures on the banks of the Connecticut River, commission spokesperson Jaimye Bartak said.
Some enthusiasts of the river walk and bikeway have been anxiously awaiting the reopening of the path.
One of the residents, Sheila McElwaine said the news that the center of the riverwalk being open is "very, very welcome."
However, the lower State Street entry area was locked Friday due to a different city project, McElwaine said.
City Parks Director Patrick Sullivan said the entrance is closed due to a police kiosk project there, but there is an entrance to the right of that area under the railroad trestle.
The closure at State Street is further frustrating efforts to encourage the use of the riverwalk, McElwaine said.
"Regrettably, no signs have been posted at the construction site directing cyclists and walkers to alternative entrances: either the underpass just north of the State Street entrance or to the skybridge at LA Fitness," they said.
In addition, the skyrbridge elevator is closed until April 1, requiring the use of the two-flight stairs, McElwaine said.
Derogation for recycled material must be included, says industry
A European Parliament proposal to set a concentration limit for the flame retardant decaBDE in substances, mixtures and articles, would put a stop to plastics from vehicles and electronics being recycled in Europe, according to recycling industry association, EuRIC.
The proposal, posted on the Parliament's website, has been forwarded to the European Commission as it considers plans to recast the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) Regulation. The aim is to update the Regulation and align it with other EU legislation and the UN's Stockholm Convention.
As a result, EuRIC says that should a concentration limit of 10mg/kg – as an unintentional trace contaminant for decaBDE – become mandatory under the POPs recast, recycling plastics from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) and electrical and electronic waste (WEEE) will come to an end in Europe.
6 Premier League managers under pressure this season
These Premier League gaffers are under the spotlight and will be under some pressure.

Wenger is under intense pressure after extending their contract with Arsenal
The English Premier league is known for a transition of managers throughout the course of a season especially in the last 3-5 years. The expectations on managers now is stronger than it has ever been as each club having different aims and goals to challenge for. However the majority of the league now looks to get to the 40-point mark to stave the risk of relegation to the championship and set their aims after that.
The financial benefit of staying in the Premier League forces the hierarchies at clubs to make a decision in terms of the position of the manager if the team is not quite producing the results needed. The top bracket of the leagues generally do not make drastic decisions over the manager position at the club, however, the last two defending champions have both felt they needed to replace their respective managers in Claudio Ranieiri at Leicester last time out and Jose Mourinho with their title winners the season before.
One of the interesting debates is who will be the first manager to leave, whether it is a sacking or to walk away? Who will be in the firing line this season?
#6 Arsene Wenger (believe it or not)
The current longest serving manager in the Premier League now splits opinion amongst the Arsenal supporters and amongst the millions who watch the game. The 67-year old Frenchman goes into every campaign with high optimism and somehow there is generally a good feeling at the club around this time of the year.
However, after the disaster of last season, that feel good feeling might not last too long at the club. The on-going discussion of whether Wenger should stay or go will no doubt carry onto this campaign following on from the uncertainty of last season that derailed their season.
No Champions League football might give the Gunners the opportunity to put all their efforts into launching a full assault towards the title this season, but whether they have the quality throughout the team to challenge is still a big question mark.
Many Arsenal fans will be baffled as to how Wenger and their club officials have allowed their two major assets enter the last year of their respective contracts in Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez. Adding Alexandre Lacazette to the frontline will add goals, there is no doubt about that. However, with the club's only other signing being Sead Kolašinac, it looks the like the same old Arsene Wenger not willing to splash the cash to add real quality to this team.
Giroud scoring dramatic winner in the epic opening game of the season
The future of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Alexis Sanchez looks like it will determine whether Wenger spends further this summer. The fear for Arsenal fans is that they deserve so much more than they are getting from the club and there might not be further investment. Wenger will need to start strong and stay close to the frontrunners in the Premier League or their position might very well just be in massive jeopardy this season, the board can't keep staying loyal to Wenger if the club is not progressing.
The opening game result against Leicester will have Gunners fans happy to start with a win, but conceding the three goals will obviously be a concern. Will be interesting to see how the atmosphere continues at the Emirates.
× Prom disaster: Teen bursts into tears when this dress arrives day before prom
SYRACUSE, N.Y. – It goes without saying that when you order something custom-made, you expect to receive exactly what you imagine.
However, for Malexa Maeweather, an 18-year-old from Syracuse, New York, a made-to-order prom dress had some unexpected and disastrous results.
According to Seventeen Magazines, Maeweather reached out to a local designer, Kia Wagner, in the hopes that they could create a one-of-a-kind prom dress. Instead, they said they got an absolute dress fail. Even worse, Maeweather didn't get to see the dress until the night before prom.
Maeweather told WGN, “I was so upset and very aggravated. I didn't know what I was going to do.”
It wasn't just Maeweather who was disappointed with the results of the dress. In fact, Maeweather's mother, Dee Lewis, told Seventeen that Wagner never updated their daughter on the progress of the dress, which left the teen in tears when it finally arrived. Having already put down a $100 downpayment for the dress priced at $300, Lewis took to Facebook to express them discontent.
“So Kia Wagner called my daughter Malexa Maeweather THE NIGHT before prom to pick up their dress which they charge $300 for. Are you serious…was I wrong for wanting my DEPOSIT BACK.”
In response to Lewis, Wagner also posted on Facebook stating, “the reason [Lewis] will not get their $100 deposit back is because I was simply following the instructions they agreed and decided to they had a variety of fabric selections to choose from and as well as several of fittings where i asked them numerous of times if this was the look they were going for…”
Nevertheless, with help from their mother and close friends, Maeweather was able to find and purchase a new dress to salvage their prom day.

Question: Is there anyway to control my dog's licking?
When they get really excited, for example when they meet someone new, when someone hops in the car or when they really enjoys getting pats, she'll start licking.
We have been parked at the traffic lights and they saw someone in another car looking at them and they started licking the window.
Is this normal behaviour? - Sharni O'Connor
Answer: The intensity of licking behaviour that your dog is displaying is a little unusual as are the triggers that cause it.
I have no idea how old your dog is and can't observe them while this behaviour is occurring.
Your dog could be licking for attention or simply because it likes what is happening.
Is your dog licking its own mouth with quick darting licks?
Is their body low and their ears down or to the side?
This body language indicates uncertainty.
Ignore your dog when it is licking.
Give it no voice, hands or eyes.
Try giving them something to distract them
Praise when they stop licking or shows calmness.
If you are holding your dog when they lick, simply put them down.
When they are in the car, give your dog something to keep them amused such as a rawhide bone to occupy it's mind.
Provide the dog with its own place to be when visitors come such as a station like a mat or bed.
Ask your visitors not to pay any attention to them when they enter the house.

Apple Inc., Google and other multinational enterprises are required to provide detailed business information in order to deal with the issue of tax avoidance by multinational companies, the country's tax agency said Tuesday.
According to the National Tax Service, South Korea introduced the annual reporting by multinational companies of aggregate information in accordance with the OECD and G20 countries' guidance in 2015.
The scheme, aimed at assessing high-level transfer pricing and other profit-shifting risks by multinational firms, took effect this year.
(Yonhap)
Under the guidance, multinational enterprises whose revenues top a certain amount are required to submit their respective aggregate business report to the tax authorities by Jan. 2.A multinational firm with a revenue of 1 trillion won ($918 million) or more should submit their so-called country-by-country report to the tax authorities as well.Such reports include details about their governance structures, fundraising and financial status, as well as their balance sheets in each country, the tax agency said.Foreign companies operating in South Korea accounted for nearly 14 percent of the country's overall corporate tax income in 2015.Multinational firms, which made up 1.5 percent of the country's 673,374 companies at the end of 2015, earned a combined 664 trillion won and paid a total of 5.3 trillion won in corporate tax that year.Foreign companies here include multinational firms directly controlled by their parents in their home countries and foreign-invested firms.

More stories from those who've suffered through abusive torment, threats, stalking, and sexual assault, and were disbelieved or shamed into silence. #MeToo: “At age ten, I was raped by a male relative for 14 days. I was sent to “spend time” with him, their wife, and their young child because they were “trusted relatives.” “At 64, I remain haunted by that 14-day trauma. Through therapy, I've made some strides but am still haunted by their threats if I told anyone. “I know they can't hurt me now, but emotionally I remain scarred. I wonder, ‘What if I tell the story and no one believes me?' ” “I still don't drive, although I have my license, because my rape took place in the rapist's car each evening, as they purported to take me out for ice cream. I'm fearful in a car to this day.

“I've read the types of punishment given to people like my terrorist, and have been forced into even deeper silence because the justice system treated victims intolerably. “And gave wrist-slaps to offenders with minute sentences as we, their victims, lived in lifelong prisons.” #MeToo: “More than 30 years ago, I had two young children when I separated from my husband. Not long afterwards, my sister's husband began coming onto me with suggestive comments about my hips.

Chelsea have confirmed that skipper John Terry will leave the club at the end of the season.
The 36-year-old has not been a regular under Antonio Conte this season and the club today confirmed this season will be their last at Stamford Bridge.
Terry has been at the club for 22-year-old years and is a one-club man (baring a loan spell at Nottingham Forest), playing over 700 times for the west London side.
The man themselves has said they will decide on their future in due course, so what are their options?
Here are six possible destinations for the former England skipper...
MLS

American sides continue up ageing Premier League talent and Terry could be the next to make the trip across the pond.
Bastian Schweinsteiger is the latest to make a mark, impressive for Chicago Fire following their move last month.
A trip across the pond would see them follow former England and Chelsea team-mates Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole who joined New York City FC and LA Galaxy respectively.
Both those sides will be interested in Terry, who has previously expressed an interest in moving to the MLS at some point .
"I would love to finish my career at Chelsea and maybe there is a time when I look to go to play in America or whatever might be best for my family at the time," they told talkSPORT.
"Hopefully I have a couple of years left at least. I always thought I could get to age of 35 and still [be] playing and I am getting close to that now."

Meanwhile, Terry has already been offered one last big pay day in the Chinese Super League.
They were a huge hit in the Far Eastern nation when they went on a one-man ambassadorial tour of Guangzhou in the summer of 2015 .
And current Guangzhou boss Luis Scolari coached Terry during their short stint as Chelsea manager and had this to say about the defender: "For John Terry dying on the field would be glory. You would need to kill them and maybe even then they could still play."
It is understood the defender has had several offers from Chinese clubs in the past and they wouldn't be the first Chelsea player to head east with Nicolas Anelka, Dider Drogba having had a go over there recently before Ramires, Oscar and John Obi Mikel pitched up for big pay days.

A number of Turkish sides have also shown their interest in signing Terry when they leaf Chelsea.
Super Lig giants Fenerbache have previously been keen , as have Antalyaspor, according to Turkish media.
They have former Blues striker Samuel Eto'o on their books at the moment.

Any footballer worth their weight in their own wages considers a move to mega rich Qatar.
Terry was previously offered a chance to play there by ex- Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola , during their time at Al-Arabi.
That ship may have sailed following Zola's departure and a move to Birmingham City where Zola currently resides would appear unlikely.
But should Terry fancy heading east for one last payday, they would likely find suitors.

Should Terry believe that they can mix it in the Premier League for another season, they could join Tony Pulis' collection of centre-backs at the Hawthorns.
The West Brom boss enquired over Terry's availability in January and admitted they would be interested in signing him.
"It (January's enquiry) was just finding out what the situation was and then it was whether we moved on it or we didn't," Pulis said last month.
"There was no approach made, it was just finding out what the situation was, and the situation was that John wanted to stay at Chelsea.
"I think they wanted to be there and stay there and be part of going out as a champion.
"If they become available in the summer we'll sit down then and have a little think about what we've got and what we haven't got and then we'll take it from there."
Move into coaching

Terry has made their managerial ambitions no secret in the past and they could opt to get a head start by focusing on working their way up the coaching ladder next summer.
Conventional wisdom would suggest two realistic routes into management for Terry.
They could opt to get their hands dirty in the lower leagues by taking on a club in League One or Two or they could look to emulate Steve Gerrard by taking up a position at the Chelsea academy.
Blues legend Marcel Desailly recently said the former England skipper look to come to an agreement with the Blues over making the transition into coaching and that would still be an option.
A pig farming business has won High Court permission to challenge the exclusion of a planned £25m power plant from the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.
AA McGuckian was granted leave to seek a judicial review over being told the facility envisaged for its site in Cloughmills, Co Antrim was not eligible for subsidy.
Outside the High Court were, from left, Brian Moss of Worthingtons Solicitors with Liam McGuckian, Coli Newell and Barney McGuckian of AA McGuckian
Proceedings against the Department for the Economy will now advance to a full hearing before the end of October.
The agri-food company planned a major combined heat and power (CHP) plant accredited to the RHI scheme.
Bosses say they spent more than £500,000 in securing planning permission, employing consultants and obtaining finance for a project with an estimated cost of £20-£25m.
Subsidies were to be provided under 2015 regulations dealing with CHP installations, according to the McGuckians case.
But in June last year the company was informed that their plans would not be eligible for RHI funds.
Financial assistance could not be provided because there was no European Union approval for the regulations.
Paying subsidies in those circumstances would breach state aid rules, the Department contends.
Lawyers representing the McGuckians went to court seeking a declaration that situation is unlawful.
Stewart Beattie QC claimed the Department was operating in a “twilight zone” where legislation was not properly brought into force.
Counsel representing the Department responded by describing the firm's case as fundamentally flawed.
Paul McLaughlin insisted it would be a breach of European law to grant accreditation without the necessary EU state aid approval.
However, Mr Justice McLaughlin held that the company had established an arguable case.
They identified issues about the legal power to accredit as being the “elephant in the courtroom”.
Outside court the McGuckians' lawyer Brian Moss, of Worthingtons Solicitors, said they were delighted at clearing the first hurdle in the legal challenge.
Mr Moss added: “At the heart of this case there's an issue about the the Department making a law passed by resolution of the Assembly which has no force or effect.”
Cleveland police urged a suspect who they said posted video of themselves on Facebook killing an elderly man on Sunday to turn themselves in to authorities. ( Reuters )
CLEVELAND—Authorities in several states were on the lookout Monday for a man police say shot a Cleveland retiree collecting aluminum cans and then posted video of the apparently random killing on Facebook. “He could be nearby. They could be far away or anywhere in between,” FBI agent Stephen Anthony said on Day 2 of the manhunt for Steve Stephens, a 37-year-old job counsellor for teens and young adults. Police said Stephens killed Robert Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old former foundry worker, on Sunday. Investigators said that Godwin was the only victim so far linked to Stephens, despite the suspect's claim in a separate video on Facebook that they killed over a dozen people. Officers searched dozens of places around the city and spoke with the suspect by cellphone, police said.

Godwin apparently was shot while out picking up cans in a plastic shopping bag, their daughter said. “Not because they needed the money, it was just something they did,” said 52-year-old Debbie Godwin. “That's all they were doing. They aren't harming anyone.” They said their father, who had 10 children, was a gentle man with nothing mean about him. “We called them the junk man,” they said. “He'd pick up things off the street and fix them. They picked up bikes and they fixed them.” The motive for the shooting wasn't entirely clear from the shaky video, in which Stephens told Godwin a woman's name and said, “She's the reason that this is about to happen to you.” Godwin did not seem to recognize the woman's name. The suspect then pointed a gun at Godwin, who shielded their face with the plastic bag. Facebook said the video was posted after the killing but wasn't broadcast on Facebook Live as police initially indicated. The suspect did go live on the social media site at another point Sunday. The video of the killing was on Facebook for about three hours before it was taken down. Stephens' Facebook page also was eventually removed. “This is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,” the company said. “We work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.” In the separate video, Stephens said: “I killed 13, so I'm working on 14 as we speak.” Police said they have not verified any other shootings or deaths. Stephens worked at Beech Brook, a behavioural health agency headquartered in Pepper Pike, near Cleveland. They helped young people develop job skills and find employment, said Beech Brook spokesperson Nancy Kortemeyer. An extensive background check before they were hired turned up nothing worrisome, they said. “We just hope Mr. Stephens is apprehended as quickly as possible so that no one else is injured,” they said. In one of the videos, Stephens could be seen holding up their employee identification and said: “I'm killing with my Beech Brook badge on, too.”

Leeds United defender Gaetano Berardi was sent off as the Whites went down to a miserable 4-1 defeat against Cardiff City on Saturday afternoon.
Berardi was dismissed for two yellow cards in the first half at Elland Road as Leeds were reduced to ten men for the fourth time in five games.
They were trailing 3-0 at half-time thanks to strikes from Calum Paterson, Junior Hoilett and Sean Morrison. Anthony Pilkington added to the misery in the second half with Sol Bamba's own goal the only consolation.
It was Berardi's second red card of the season. They were sent off in Leeds' 3-0 success over Bristol City at Ashton Gate in October.
And while they will be out of the match against Sheffield United, they are also set to serve at least an extra match and will miss the game against the Robins at Elland Road on Sunday February 18.
Leeds will also be sweating on the fitness of fellow defender Pontus Jansson who was carried off on a stretcher following an off-the-ball clash with Sol Bamba during the humiliating defeat.
It's thought the defender has injured their ankle and is a major doubt for the Robins clash.
The Whites are now six league games without a win ahead of the matches against the Blades and the Robins.

Ewha Womans University announced Monday a test of a new grading system in which professors are entitled to choose how to grade students over the coming year.The new system aims to allow professors to evaluate students more appropriately in regards to the characteristics of the classes, according to the university.Professors may choose between new absolute evaluation and relative evaluation systems, or a blend of the two.In the new relative evaluation method, the number of students who can get a certain grade is not set by the university, so professors may freely adjust the proportion of grades.In terms of the new absolute evaluation method, professors may give out grades based on their own absolute standards.They may also combine the two methods by adopting an absolute grading system as a basic principle while ensuring a set percentage of students to get a certain grade.Ewha Womans University said, “The school will offer more freedom to professors in grading, and instead of inducing competition for higher grades, it hopes to provide intellectual exploration for students by having them evaluated based on their accomplishments.”The university will take surveys at the end of the next two semesters as part of the review process for the new professor-oriented grading system and try to resolve any problems that are brought up.By Ahn Sang-yool (koolsangon@heraldcorp.com)

Corrie star Nicola Thorp has admitted working on the Pat Phelan shootout storyline took a lot of bottle... which they ordered up at the bar when filming was over.
The 29-year-old actor plays Pat's daughter Nicola Rubenstein, who ends up in a pool of blood on the floor during the baddie's exit scenes.
They say: “Oh, my God, lying on that floor for half a day, surrounded by fake blood was not fun.
“You have to unwind after days like that. It can be quite gruelling. You go to the pub and it is wine, wine and chats.”
After Pat, played by Connor McIntyre, 57, barges their way into the Grimshaw house, Nicola, Eileen and Seb tackle them and then a shot ring out.
(Image: ITV)
Nicola says: “There is the element of throwing yourself on the ground for 18 takes which gets a little bit exhausting.
“It's one scene after another, after another – there's no time to chill out.”
But the blood was “like sticky toffee apple kind of stuff”.
They say: “There is an awful lot of blood. I was covered in caramel, which was super fun.”
(Image: ITV)
Nicola also reveals having a baby on the show has made them broody.
They say: “I've got four babies on set – Sebastian, Felix, Alfie and Mikey – and I love them all. Two sets of twins.
“I was sort of dreading it, but now they've arrived I'm absolutely besotted.”
Nicola's co-star Sue Cleaver, 54, who plays Eileen Grimshaw, backed ITV's decision to broadcast Phelan's violent exit scenes after the 9pm watershed. They said: “It was the right decision.”

After the gallant victory over Sheffield United by Bristol City on Friday evening it was revealed that front-man Milan Djuric is set for an operation later this month.
As reported by the Bristol Post at the end of November the forward has suffered an injury set back and their groin requires more surgery.
Lee Johnson explained the situation after the powerful attacker had put in a 45-minute shift against the Blades in front of the TV cameras.
“Milan Djuric couldn't even walk this morning [Friday] but somehow we got them going for the game and to play 45 minutes,” Johnson told the Post.
“There's an operation booked in for the December 18 – they need to have it done and it was me that made the decision. They can't go on any more, poor fellow.
“We had a walk to Costa on Friday morning as a team and we're having to wait for him. We're getting them going with injections and anti-inflammatories and he's unable to train.
“But you see when they came on they just gave us a bit of a platform and what I'm really excited about is that in three to five weeks after the operation hopefully everything will be behind him.
“And we'll start seeing the real Milan Djuric,” they explained.
And the plans for coping without him?
“Some of the U23s are going to have to step up and become men very, very quickly because we can't afford to lose a body a game at the moment," said Johnson
During last week, assistant head coach Dean Holden had agreed with the Post's assessment that Djuric has been ‘soldiering through' recent matches.
“He's willing to put that [an operation] on hold for now, which is fantastic for us. It gives us the option to keep using them sparingly.
“He's willing to carry on and keep taking the painkillers for us and they deserve a lot of credit for that.
“He feels personally that he's not able to give their 100 per cent quality. He's giving us work rate, fight and desire and all that, but they won't be able to because he's in that much pain,” explained Holden.
The Post wishes the striker a speedy recovery and salutes the international spearhead for the great effort being put in for the Robins.
City next take on Nottingham Forest at 3pm on Saturday.
According to Mercanti, those same players are part of an emerging consortium interested in exploring redevelopment options for the three venues.
"It's fair to say that every member of the arena study is aware and at the table with the conversation and the pursuit."
Mercanti envisions talking with the city about more amenities for the existing buildings and a "bigger conversation" around adding commercial, retail and residential components.
Merulla is excited by Carmen's proposal but says the city can't consider a potential billion-dollar redevelopment project without a competitive process. They intend to put forward a motion directing staff to talk to other potential bidders and "aggressively pursue" options.
"We need to be open and transparent and give an opportunity to everyone rather than sole-sourcing."
Mercanti says Carmen's is fully prepared to compete with other bidders. "The Carmen's Group is respectful of process and we understand that ultimately things have to happen through due process."
Merulla notes that privatizing operations of the former HECFI buildings in 2013 has already saved the city millions of dollars. They say the goal should now be to capitalize on the development possibilities with an eye to growing tax assessment and generating revenue.
Coun. Terry Whitehead agrees. They say the pitch from Carmen's underlines that the venues are at a "crossroads" regarding their lifespan and economic redevelopment possibilities.
'We haven't really tested the development community — the private sector — in regards to what there is now and what it could be. It's time to have that discussion."
Interestingly, the proposal comes fast on the heels of renewed complaints from Hamilton Bulldogs owner Michael Andlauer about the city dragging its feet on what to do with the arena.
It also lands just days after Carmen's — which operates five hospitality and entertainment businesses and employs about 400 people — publicly announced it's relocating its corporate headquarters to the downtown Hamilton City Centre from Stone Church Road East.
Combine that with Carmen's recent role in saving the Hamilton Cardinals baseball team and its financial contribution to the upcoming HAMILTON sign at city hall and you're left with the impression of an intensely local company on a strategic roll.

Doctor Foster star Suranne Jones has been researching hard for their new role playing iconic and historic lesbian landowner Anne Lister.
The 39-year-old TV star will be filming girl-on-girl scenes for the upcoming BBC biopic titled Gentleman Jack (the monicker given to Anne by locals in their native Yorkshire).
Suranne and show writer Sally Wainwright have reportedly visited Anne's home, Shibden Hall, near Halifax ahead of the filming process.
During their trip, Suranne was given access to Anne's private diaries that gave details of their lesbian love affairs.
(Image: PA)
“[It was] a real privilege,” Suranne told the Daily Star of their chance to finger through Anne's dusty old diaries.
A BBC Spokesman added that the lesbian drama is likely to thrill audiences.
“Shibden Hall is a remarkable and unlikely love story,” the spokesperson said.
It is believed Anne kept a diary of their incredible life but their intimate secrets were written in code that was only deciphered in the 1980s.
(Image: BBC)
 They are viewed as the ‘first modern lesbian' in Britain with the costume drama set in the 1830s and chronicling Anne's romance with heiress Ann Walker who they met in 1832 and was determined to marry.
In July, when the show was announced (and which is due to start filming next year), Suranne gushed about being reunited with writer Sally who created the show Scott & Bailey.
“I remember the feeling of reading them scripts. They were scripts for women – fresh, daring and bizarre in a wonderful, modern, fun, complex, challenging way,” Suranne said.
Why Hardik Pandya should be used more extensively in Test cricket
How the team management tackle Pandya will be crucial in shaping their Test career
@AbhiDeobhakta by Abhijeet Opinion 14 Aug 2017, 13:09 IST
Hardik Pandya's maiden hundred should prompt the team management to use them more extensively in Tests
Virat Kohli made a gutsy statement about Hardik Pandya at the press conference after the first Test at Galle. “I have a lot of faith in them (Hardik) as far as any format is concerned. If they grow in confidence – you see someone like Ben Stokes, what they do for England, brings in great balance as an all-rounder. I see no reason why Hardik Pandya can't become that for India,” they said.
The reason it is a gutsy statement is because Hardik has completed just two Tests with relatively very little to do with bat and bowl. Although they have cracked a century in the ongoing third Test, it is still early days in their Test career.
The key words here are “if they grow in confidence”. In order to do that, they should be given more opportunities to showcase their talent both with bat and bowl. Coach Shastri and captain Kohli will need to think intelligently about how the promising youngster gains experience as an all-rounder so they can be close to Stokes' caliber.
Potential to make it big
Hardik has already proved their potential in limited overs cricket and they have the potential to do it in Tests
The lanky lad from Baroda first came into limelight when Mumbai Indians picked them up in 2015. They have had a few ups and downs already in the IPL and they came out of it strongly. IPL 2017 was the most successful season for Hardik and the one that helped them break into the limited overs squad for India.
Since making their ODI debut in October last year, the Baroda all-rounder has continued to impress one and all. They seem to have gained a few yards in their pace and their batting continues to improve. The innings against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy final is a testament to their explosive skills.
So it was only a matter of time before they were selected into the Test squad. During the fag end of Dhoni's Test captaincy, it was becoming clear that the Test team desperately needed a genuine all-rounder. India successfully promoted Ashwin up the batting order, but the lack of a seam bowling all-rounder option was clearly visible in the Test team.
The team management did well to zero in on Pandya at the early stage and include them into the Test team.
Early Debut in Tests
Hardik had just 19 first-class games under their belt before making their Test debut in the ongoing series against Sri Lanka. It meant that the young all-rounder did not come in with a lot of experience of playing in the longer version of the game. It also means that they will gain a hands-on experience while playing Test cricket.
The 23-year-old is already an integral part of limited over cricket and Kohli made sure in their statement that they will be a regular in the Test team as well. Hence Pandya will get to play very little domestic cricket to hone their Test skills. Given this situation we need to be very patient in expecting them to start performing immediately in Test cricket. They have a long way to learn before they can be considered even close to some of the great all-rounders. They definitely have the potential to do so.
Some people also might argue that Jadeja had started off their Test career in similar manner – perceived as a batting all-rounder. They did not live up to expectations when it came to batting and Pandya could end up just like Jadeja if promoted up the order.
While this theory is not all wrong, one thing to note is that Jadeja was believed to be a batting all-rounder because of the runs they scored in domestic cricket. After all, they have three triple-centuries in domestic cricket.
However, Pandya's case is a bit different. From their debut in the IPL to their recent knock in the Champions Trophy final, there is enough proof that the Baroda youngster is a far more superior batsman than Jadeja.
It is perfectly fine if the team management wants them to feel their way around Test cricket by slotting them at no.8, and giving them a few overs initially. However, it will help if this approach remains only for first few Tests.
Team Management's approach towards Pandya in Tests
The team management must think intelligently to shape up Hardik's Test career
There is little doubt that Hardik has a fixed role to play in limited overs cricket. They will bat at no.6 or 7 and the mandate given to them will invariably be to come in and smash. It is also certain that they will bowl at least 7 or 8 overs on average in each match.
It will be interesting to see what strategy the think tank adopts for the all-rounder in Tests. It is pretty much clear that they will not get to play much domestic cricket and hence Kohli and Shastri's approach will play a very important role in shaping Pandya's Test career.
There was very little for Pandya to do in the first two Tests. They batted at no.8 and bowled just 25 overs, getting three crucial wickets. The team management must make up its mind whether they have selected them as a batting all-rounder or as a bowling all-rounder.
If the selection is as a batting all-rounder then they need to bat higher than no.8 whereas if the selection is as a bowling all-rounder then they need to bowl more overs.
It is important to note that they could complete their maiden century because the no.9, 10 and 11 could bat out 100 deliveries.
In their 62-run partnership with Kuldeep, the explosive all-rounder was happy to hold off their big shots and rotate strike. Their first half of the century reflected that approach. However, once Kuldeep got out, Pandya was forced to hit the big shots.
While batting at no. 8, you are always in the danger of running out of partners. It won't always be possible that Kuldeep, Shami and Umesh will bat out considerable amount of deliveries. It is also possible that the big-hitter from Baroda can miscue any of their big shot and be holed out. In either scenario, they are too good a batsman to be run out of partners or forced to hit big shots prematurely.
If the youngster is promoted up the order, even at no.7 if not at 6, then they will have Saha coming in after him.
Yes, in this Indian team every individual has been assigned a fixed role and it is one of the reasons behind the success of the Test team. However, if giving more opportunity to a promising young player prompts a slight change, then it should be accommodated.
There is not even a need to change the mandate given to Pandya irrespective at what position they bat.
The promising all-rounder needs to get more exposure before the real test begins against South Africa in January next year. India embarks on tough tours of South Africa, England and Australia in 2018 so Pandya will need to be given as much opportunity as possible in the relatively easier series against Sri Lanka.
India plays the Islanders again in November-December and the team management must make most of it by giving Hardik as much exposure as possible.
There is no doubt that there is immense talent in the Baroda all-rounder.  They are an explosive player and hence will always attract attention.
It will also be very important how they handle it and the pressure that comes with playing Test cricket. If they do that successfully then India will have found an all-rounder they desperately were looking for all these years.
Having a rubbish Monday?
Yeah, well spare a thought for Jordan Baker. The pro golfer, aka @OfficialBakes on Twitter, would have awoken this morning to the grim realisation that Rickie Fowler cost them £2MILLION.
Way to go, Rickster…
Allow us to explain.
You may recall that, a few weeks ago, we told how Jordan was halfway to completing the greatest golf betting victory of all time, having correctly predicted that Sergio Garcia and Brooks Koepka would win the Masters and US Open respectively.
All they needed was for Rickie Fowler to win the Open and Justin Thomas to win the US PGA, and he'd turn their £2 stake into £2million at the expense of betting behemoth Bet365.
Alas, Fowler could do no better than a tie for 22nd at Royal Birkdale and, with that, the bet was bust.
However, Baker will forever be haunted by the worst two words in the English language – "what if" – after Thomas sealed victory in the US PGA at Quail Hollow last night.
What. A. Sickener.
As Thomas was staging a superb back nine charge to take their maiden major, Baker was busy keeping their Twitter followers updated on their mental state.
Oh my god, if Justin Thomas wins. I'm jumping out of a plane without a chute — Bakes (@OfficialBakes) August 13, 2017
YOUVE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING — Bakes (@OfficialBakes) August 13, 2017

Seems fair.
Do the right thing, Rickie.
"Think Out Loud" is traveling to cities and towns across the state to hear about the policy issues that matter to Oregonians. How do the decisions of lawmakers in Salem affect our lives? See our full coverage here.
All around Oregon, drivers, cyclists and pedestrians are struggling with the potholes left behind from a particularly brutal winter. "Think Out Loud" sets out to learn how these ubiquitous hazards fit into the larger plans lawmakers are making to fund maintenance and new construction on Oregon's roads.
This past winter was particularly hard on Oregon's roads: unusually heavy snow storms that led to tire chains requirements, plus more freezing and thawing than usual. You've probably noticed that, as a result, the roads are full of potholes.
Scot Pears has definitely noticed. Pears is a transportation maintenance manager for the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT). They and their crew are responsible for Route 217, Route 99 and a large swath of Highway 26 from the Vista Ridge Tunnel up to North Plains. They explained that normally at this time of year, their crew would be focused on mowing the grass on the side of the road and killing off weeds to prepare for springtime.
"None of that work has been done. It's all been focused on potholes," they said.
There are two ways to fix a pothole — the hot patch and the cold patch. A cold patch is considered a quick fix. It basically consists of pouring asphalt from a bag into the pothole. These patches are not expected to last long.
"If it's wet and you're putting it in there just to stop cars from breaking their wheels on it, it could last a couple of hours," said Pears.
If the pavement is dry, the more permanent hot patch can be applied. The crews use hot asphalt and a bonding agent that helps the patch stick to the road. It should last until the road is eventually repaved.
Whether it's an emergency patch or scheduled pothole repair, ODOT often sends a crew of half a dozen workers and three to five vehicles to get the job done. That's because working on a busy highway as traffic whizzes by on either side is dangerous work.
"I've had three members of my crew hit by cars in the last two years," Pears said. "Two of them involved hospital stays. One individual ... actually got hit by a car, flew over on the hood, smashed the front windshield and then got tossed up under the gate of the truck that they were standing behind. ... We were lucky we didn't lose a member of our crew."
Of course, patching potholes are far from the only thing ODOT has to spend money on. So how does the agency decide what to prioritize? According to ODOT assistant director Travis Brouwer, basic maintenance and preservation are a top priority.
"Oregonians have invested billions of dollars in the transportation system over generations and we need to keep that system in good working order," they said. "Generally, we prioritize the basic fixing the system above the expansion of that system."
Basic maintenance includes clearing dead animals off the road, plowing snow and repaving in addition to repairing potholes. But it doesn't include expanding public transit, widening highways or adding infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians. All of that falls under new construction, which is also a big part of ODOT's purview.
"We look at the entire multimodal transportation system and try to figure out where we can have the biggest bang for the buck through some strategic investment in additional capacity," Brouwer explained.
The Oregon Transportation Commission ultimately decides how to allocate the money in ODOT's budget. The commission is made up of local government officials and regional business leaders. But before that group can decide how to spend ODOT's budget, the legislature has to decide how much the agency will get.
In addition to making up a $1.6 billion budget shortfall, lawmakers are under pressure to find a way to fund transportation upgrades and the basic maintenance Brouwer described as a top priority.
"We know that whatever we do, it won't be enough," said Rep. Cliff Bentz.
Bentz, a Republican from Ontario in eastern Oregon, is the co-vice chair of the joint committee on transportation preservation and modernization. That's the committee charged with the daunting task of coming up with a transportation package for the entire legislature to vote on before the end of the session.
Lawmakers estimate that it would take 30 cents a gallon increase or a doubling of the state gas tax to bring in enough funding for everything ODOT wants to accomplish in terms of maintenance and new construction.
Sen. Lee Beyer, a Democratic from Springfield and the co-chair of the joint committee, said the committee is considering a gradual increase over 20 years because voters would be unlikely to accept 30 cents a gallon increase if it came all at once. Also, because there's not enough construction capability in the state to do all the necessary maintenance at once.
One thing lawmakers agree needs to be addressed is congestion on Oregon's urban roads, particularly in Portland. Beyer said this is a concern to people around the state, even if they never drive on Portland's highways.
"One of the things people don't think about is that we're an exporting state and when we traveled around the state, the thing that we heard the most from the business community is, 'You've got to fix the congestion in Portland because everything we make and sell goes through there,'" they explained.
Bentz said the plan the committee is considering will probably go over well with their constituents in eastern Oregon because the proposal will likely ask more of urban Oregonians than those who live in rural areas.
Bentz and Beyer say their committee expects to introduce a transportation proposal sometime in May.
In the meantime, when Oregonians get frustrated by potholes, they can report them using the "Ask ODOT" system the agency has set up for citizens to help them spot problems on state roads. Pears said when they get a report of something that's in the area he's responsible for, they or another member of their crew will check it out.
"And you could expect an answer back from "Ask ODOT" within five days addressing what will be done with your problem or giving you an explanation as to why something did or didn't happen," they said.

I'm A Celebrity 2017 winner Georgia 'Toff' Toffolo has revealed why she's embracing their 'flat chest' after an embarrassing chicken fillet incident in the jungle.
22-year-old Toff admitted they had been nervous about stripping off into a bikini for the famous jungle shower scenes and brought in back-up.
The Made In Chelsea beauty managed to smuggle chicken fillets in with their bra only to pop one of them when they accidentally sat on it.
But in typical Toff style, they were able to laugh off the incident.

"I had one booby with a chicken fillet and one without, so I had to sacrifice them," they joked in an interview with The Sun .
"I've just had to embrace my small boobies," the jungle Queen added.
Despite in their own admission, 'lacking in the chest area', Toff said she'd never resort to surgery.
"I doubt I would ever get a boob job when I can buy chicken fillets. It's nothing to be ashamed of," they explained.
As well as smuggling in chicken fillets, Toff also brought in banned make-up with them - but this time the producers encouraged the contraband.
22-year-old Toff admitted they refused to appear on the show if they aren't allowed it to cover them spots.
Early on in the show viewers at home noticed that the Made In Chelsea star appeared to be wearing foundation.
Even their fellow Made In Chelsea castmate Louise Thompson tweeted ITV to ask if make-up was allowed, writing: "Are they allowed makeup in the jungle? @ITV @imacelebrity."

They shared: “When producers told me it was banned I broke down in tears and said, ‘I can't do this.'"
Toff continued: "It's a medical problem and I've been on strong tablets for six months trying to get rid of them. So show bosses agreed that, because it was a medical problem, I was allowed to put foundation on once a day in the morning.

“I wish I could walk around with no make-up on but I have big angry red marks all down the side of my cheeks. Some people don't understand how badly it affects my confidence and upsets me.”
However, they added to The Sun that their jungle diet and break from bad food has done wonders for their skin and will now get allergy tests done.

Over the weekend Toff became the third female to win the series in a row – following Scarlett Moffat and Vicky Pattison – and beat third-placed Radio DJ Iain Lee and soap actor Jamie Lomas in the final.
After being announced as the winner they stood open mouthed for 30 seconds unable to speak.
They said: “I don't know what to say, obviously I am shocked I didn't think anyone would like me. “I am really taken aback, it is really overwhelming. Wow. Is this real?
“It is a dream, I have watched this since I was a little girl.”
The demented rhetoric grows more colourful by the week and the danger of all-out war has unnerved global sharemarkets, but Korea's headline-grabbing tensions barely seem to raise an eyebrow for Australians doing business with Seoul.
In South Korea – Australia's third biggest export market – trade sentiment and opportunities are seemingly as good as they've ever been, especially for agricultural goods.
A newly-elected South Korean president with fresh economic objectives and a steady rise in agribusiness openings stirred by the December 2014 free trade agreement (FTA) with Australia have fuelled the positive sentiment.
However, Australian and Korean-base trade leaders and analysts are frustrated.
Most feel rogue state North Korea is a more silly, super-sized distraction than a serious risk of triggering a superpower showdown embroiling the US and its allies.
Maverick communist North Korea's President Kim Jong-un.
The Australia-Korea Business Council (AKBC) is particularly disappointed the North Korean headlines are almost the only thing many Australians know about the Korean Peninsula, despite our strong 60-plus year trade relationship with the South Korean Republic.
Australia's $18.1 billion in exports of minerals, beef, sugar, grain, horticulture and processed foods, coupled with our imports of Korean cars, electrical goods, petroleum and machinery parts make South Korea our fourth most valuable trading partner.
The two-way relationship was worth about $30b last year, and mostly in Australia's favour.
Despite some strict import protocols and a tradition of agricultural import tariffs, Korea is still our third biggest buyer of beef – a market worth $1.35b in 2016.
In fact, beef is Australia's third biggest commodity export (behind coal and iron ore) to the world's 11th largest economy.
Fresh Australian horticultural produce is finding increasing market demand in South Korea.
“But almost every day there's hype about Donald Trump's tweets and the man with the missiles in North Korea, so there is a tendency for us to forget our strong ties with the south, while the potential of our economic relationship with South Korea is not well understood,” said AKBC executive director, Liz Johnston.
They said even the new export options created by the FTA with South Korea tended to attract less public discussion here than similar FTAs recently signed with China and Japan.
South Korea's potential is not well understood says Australia Korea Business Council boss, Liz Johnston.
“It's a lot less dangerous and much safer to do business in Korea than just about anywhere in Asia.”
Queensland based fruit exporter, Marie Piccone, couldn't agree more.
“We like Korea,” said Mrs Piccone, whose Manbulloo mangoes from North Queensland and Northern Territory are in hot demand.
“There are no grey channel trade issues, it's a very stable and relatively prosperous economy and it has very little corruption.
I've never felt unsafe over there and we certainly wouldn't consider dropping any of our business to Korea. - Marie Piccone, Manbulloo Limited
“We're watching what's happening each day, but we have not noticed any signs of other Australian businesses, or our Korean partners, feeling in danger in recent months.
“I've never felt unsafe over there and we certainly wouldn't consider dropping any of our business to Korea.”
Staying calm and carrying on
In Seoul, Australian trade and investment specialist, Daniel Kim, said the build up in ferocious threats and long-range missile tests from Kim Jong-un's maverick in North Korean communist regime during the past nine months had created “very little” visible impact on people in neighbouring South Korea.
Nor did all the hoo-ha appear to have hurt the country's attraction as a market for new Australian business interest.
Mr Kim, the trade commissioner with Trade and Investment Queensland, said the facts spoke for themselves.
“The travel warnings from Canberra have not changed for Australians visiting here – ‘exercise normal safety precautions',” they said.
“Yes, we've had some Australian CEO's asking questions with regard to North Korea, but only two of the 40 business visits from Australia I've been associated with (this year) have been postponed.
“Most exporters realise South Koreans just get on with their lives – they've been living with this situation in the north since the 1950s.”
They said fortuitously for Australia, “enormous demand” was emerging for overseas food and beverage imports as modern Korea's overall self sufficiency in agricultural production declined.
Seoul-based trade commissioner with Trade and Investment Queensland, Daniel Kim, says South Koreans, and their Australian business partners, are "just get on with their lives".
“That's translating into deals for many countries – Korean food imports increased to be worth $16b last year,” Mr Kim said.
Exports from Queensland alone jumped about 30 per cent.
One notable new player was Bundaberg Brewed Drinks which sold 1 million bottles of ginger beer within six months of landing its first container shipment.
Mr Kim said opportunities for Australian processed poultry were now on the cards in the wake of Australian egg producers getting a foot in the door with fresh and processed egg products this year after bird flu forced about 30 million birds (almost a third of the Korean flock) to be culled in the past year.
Our good reputation counts
South Korea's high priority on food security and safe products had already fostered close relationships and subsidiary businesses within Australia, including beef processing contracts and value-added exports which originated during the Mad Cow disease scare overseas in the 1990s.
Nutriceuticals had become a new active area for Korean investment in Australia.
“Korean investors like Australia's credentials, but they're not interested in a land grab,” Mr Kim said.
“The focus is on strategies to deliver safe, premium quality products and innovative food technology to sell in their home markets and globally.”
“There are also shared values in relationships with Korean businesses which tend to create a level of intimacy that's much more solid than just the transactional function of buying and selling goods.”
Manbulloo managing director, Marie Piccone, with their Australian produce in Seoul.
Mrs Piccone, whose Manbulloo operation grows about 800 hectares of mangoes, mostly for domestic markets, agreed the Korean market was less hyped up and more meaningful than other fast rising Asian export destinations.
“Provided you stick to your commitment to deliver what you promise it takes a lot for Korean partners to want to break that relationship,” they said.
“Koreans don't get highly strung or agitated about what's going on in the news – they may be a bit more concerned at times, but they live with this sort of noise from the North every day.”

Just look at people who work outdoors or spend a lot of time outside, as opposed to those who avoid the sun. Or it could be that you need a better moisturizer. The products reviewed are just a few favorites and very effective products from the Oil of Olay Beauty Products line.
Antioxidants help to protect your body against damage caused by free radicals so they are very important for antiaging nutrition. The taste of coconuts is liked by everyone and all the people like the sweet dishes made out of coconut. These things are as hard as rocks and sometimes so big they're also hard to swallow.
I'm looking at them all this time and I can't stand it. Phytessence Wakame is a sea weed that can eliminate harmful enzymes that attack hyaluronic acid. If you wash your skin more than that, you could be stripping away essential lipids inside.
A wide brimmed hat or a long sleeved dress would suffice in such instances. But when it comes down to it, does the best collagen firming lotion really exist? Most of the products found at these stores are inferior because they do not contain the necessary ingredients to work effectively.
Chronic exposure to this ingredient is linked to anemia, kidney damage and may affect a developing baby if you are pregnant! One way we can deal with the problem is by using an anti wrinkle cream from Hydroxatone. If you want to get by even cheaper, just get the generic animal shaped vitamins sold right next to them on the same shelf. https://lumalifteye.com/krasa-cream/
'Respect' Wasn't A Feminist Anthem Until Aretha Franklin Made It One
Enlarge this image toggle caption Express Newspapers/Getty Images Express Newspapers/Getty Images
On this day 50 years ago, a little-known gospel singer from Detroit went into a New York City recording studio to try to jump-start their career. No one saw it coming, but the song Aretha Franklin laid down on Valentine's Day 1967 would go on to become one of the greatest recordings of all time.
"Respect" hit the top of the charts four months later and turned Aretha Franklin into a feminist champion. The track was actually a clever gender-bending of a song by Otis Redding, whose original reinforced the traditional family structure of the time: Man works all day, brings money home to wife and demands their respect in return.
Franklin's version blew that structure to bits. For one, Redding's song doesn't spell out "R-E-S-P-E-C-T" like Franklin's does. It also doesn't have the backup singers and their clever interplay. So much of what made "Respect" a hit — and an anthem — came from Franklin's rearrangement. They remembered how it all came together when they spoke with WHYY's Fresh Air in 1999.
YouTube
"My sister Carolyn and I got together and — I was living in a small apartment on the west side of Detroit, piano by the window, watching the cars go by — and we came up with that infamous line, the 'sock it to me' line," they told host Terry Gross. "Some of the girls were saying that to the fellas, like 'sock it to me' in this way or 'sock it to me' in that way. It's not sexual. It was nonsexual, just a cliché line."
Franklin's "Respect" became a transformative moment — not only in their career but also in the women's rights movement and the civil rights movement. Which makes one wonder: What did Redding think of all this?
"Well, they didn't like it," says Mark Ribowsky, author of the biography Dreams To Remember: Otis Redding, Stax Records, and the Transformation of Southern Soul. Speaking to NPR in 2015, Ribowsky said Redding eventually accepted that "Respect" no longer belonged to them — and that you can see it for yourself in their 1967 performance at the Monterey Pop Festival.
YouTube
"He comes onstage and they go, 'This next song is a song that a girl took away from me' — but they say it with the Otis charm, a little glint in the eye," Ribowski said. "And Otis couldn't begrudge them that."
Rolling Stone named "Respect" one of the top five greatest songs of all time, saying: "Franklin wasn't asking for anything. They sang from higher ground: a woman calling an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short, if you want some, you will earn it."
Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Aerospace & Defense (A&D) business of Oxford Performance Materials (OPM).

Earlier this month, this column had pointed out that investors are looking to mid-cap IT stocks as a safe haven in the current market correction. Since then, some of these stocks have corrected by around 4-8%. But note that the benchmark for the sector—shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd—has also corrected by around 6% during the same period. As such, valuations relative to large-sized companies remain high.
While it's true that some of these companies are growing revenue and profit at a faster pace, what shouldn't be ignored is that some of the risks associated with mid-sized companies haven't really disappeared. And with valuations having risen so high, risks for investors have just compounded.
“Investors seem to be focused only on near-term growth and ignore quality of the business and its riskiness. Tier-1 companies are better quality businesses because of their lower customer concentration, a broader set of capabilities, ability to hold on to their clients and the ability to absorb shocks in the event of an economic downturn in future,” analysts at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities said in a 17 March note to clients.
While large-sized companies get around 20-22% of revenues from their top 10 clients, in the case of mid-caps, the contribution is more than double those levels. In Mindtree Ltd's case, the top 10 customers accounted for 44% of revenues in the December quarter, down from 46% two years ago. For Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, contribution from the largest 10 customers has remained more or less steady in the past two years at 51%. In the case of Mphasis Ltd, it has risen from 48% two years ago to 55% in Q3, according to data collated by Nirmal Bang.
For Persistent Systems, just one customer accounted for 28% of revenues last quarter, where for large-caps, this ratio is typically in the region of 3%.
In the past, growth rates at some of these companies have been volatile, simply because the loss of a large project or a client can have a large impact on overall performance. Investors seem to be disregarding these risks. As Nirmal Bang's analysts put it, “We would advise investors to focus on sustainability and not overpay for a riskier business model. Current valuations of mid-cap stocks factor in strong growth over a two- to three-year time frame, which we believe is unlikely.”

Stonington Originally published in Castine Patriot, June 8, 2017 and Island Ad-Vantages, June 8, 2017 and The Weekly Packet, June 8, 2017 Panel speaks out on addressing local opiate abuse
by Anne Berleant
Experts from the fields of medicine, social work, education and recovery spoke to more than 100 people at a panel discussion on local substance abuse, specifically opiates, last month at the Stonington Opera House.
The National Institute on Drug Abuse defines drug addiction as “a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences.”
While the event was aimed at the Island communities, the opiate crisis is Peninsula-wide and nationwide.
“We have a major heroin/opiate problem on our island…[but] it is not unique to our island,” said Roger Bergen, co-chairperson of the Opiate-Free Island Project.
In 2016, drug overdose deaths in Maine climbed 40 percent from 2015, to 378, mostly from opiates. In response, the Legislature and Governor Paul LePage approved a $3.7 million bill in January 2016 to fund additional law enforcement and treatment around drugs, and more is sought this legislative session.
Locally, doctors, mental health workers, government agencies, and communities are working to address the issue of substance abuse disorder in their own front yards.
Speaking out on opiate addiction
Sharing knowledge and experience, and the social and medical issues surrounding the issue, seven individuals each highlighted the concerns, depth and struggles behind addressing addiction, recovery, and the role of the community in stemming the increase in substance abuse disorders.
Daryl B., in recovery
“Everyone stops using sooner or later: They either get help or they die.”
Sober for 4 years: “I'm an addict, a felon, a father, a son, an operations manager, an aspiring motorcycle rider. I'm so many things.”
On using opiates: “That wool sweater two sizes too small finally came off. I felt like I arrived, like I could live and just be myself.”
On recovery: “Recovery is not a one-shot deal…It took some people really showing me how bad my issue was…I started to buy into the fact that I never had to use if I didn't want to…I took every small opportunity offered and built off it.”
Dan Johnson, Acadia Family Center
“It's not just ‘say no.'”
Substance abuse disorder is not a moral failing but an acquired brain disease.
Genetics play a major role.
95 percent failure rate for abstinence models.
Higher success rate for medical assisted treatment with counseling.
Sue Mackey Andrews, Maine Resilience Building Network
“It's never too late to help someone with substance abuse disorders.”
Adverse childhood experiences—trauma—creates climate of fear, anxiety, stress, contributes to substance abuse disorder.
Denise Black, Healthy Acadia, Drug-Free Communities
“A spectrum of support is needed.”
Local recovery coach training available.
Dr. Charles Zelnick,
Island Health and Wellness
Offers medication assisted therapy.
Treated 30-35 patients over five years: “I think that's just the tip of the iceberg.”
Todd West, Deer Isle-Stonington High School Principal
“The landscape is changing.”
“Small number” of high school students using opiates.
School wants to provide resilience training, treatment, education.
Tony Bray, Opiate-Free Island Partnership
“We need to de-mystify process of getting help.”
Addicts have “burned all their bridges…Recovery is really complex…There's a short window in which addicts are willing to reach out for help.”
Ideas: 24/7 hotline for Deer Isle-Stonington, increased counseling.
Los Angeles Chargers middle linebacker Denzel Perryman left Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks with the assistance of a cart.
Perryman suffered what looked like a left foot injury, and was seen with that shoe off as they were being ushered into the Chargers' locker room.
The injury occurred with approximately five minutes left to go in the first quarter. Though Los Angeles boasts depth along both offensive and defensive lines as well as in the secondary, the inside linebacker position isn't one they have much, if any, depth.
Perryman is anticipated to take on a much larger role for the Bolts in 2017 after seeing 11 starts in 2016, a campaign in which they amassed 71 tackles.
After seeing their No. 7 overall NFL draft pick from 2017 in Mike Williams suffer two herniated discs in their back and second round pick offensive guard Forrest Lamp tear their ACL before preseason even began — Bolts fans can only wait and hope that reports on Perryman aren't as serious as they could be.
Currently, the Chargers have announced that Perryman is questionable to return with a left ankle injury.
UPDATE: Perryman was ruled OUT by the team, and returned to the sidelines with a boot on their foot and on crutches to begin the second half.
Zoo Miami doctors performed a double root canal on a 4.5 year old giant otter. According to Zoo Miami's Facebook page Ticuna, a “highly endangered 50-pound otter had broken both of their upper canines, exposing the pulp and creating what was certainly severe pain.” The zoo also added that Ticuna is “doing swimmingly well following a precedent-setting double root canal.”
No one mentioned that the trains are launching after local ridership has plummeted.
The plunge after 2013 erased almost 40 per cent of ridership gains made while various governments planned and approved rail transit between 2006 and 2013. That's got Cambridge Mayor Doug Craig worried there are not enough passengers for trains.
"I'm concerned right now, yes I am," they said.
Craig had pitched better buses rather than trains.
"We can't predict what the world's going to look like 10, 15, 20 years out. There could be a lot of changes we don't know. Driverless cars, and things like that. We can't predict the future as well we would like too," they said.
Regional Chair Ken Seiling expects passengers will return to ride trains.
"I think we'll see our ridership move up again," they said, citing the draw of rail transit in other cities.
In building rail transit in Kitchener and Waterloo, angling to draw jobs and homes to central areas, governments chose not to extend street-level trains into Cambridge, arguing high costs aren't justified by lower ridership.
That's left Cambridge residents helping to pay for trains, but served by express buses, which are not rapid buses because they do not have dedicated lanes.
Planning is underway to extend rail transit into Cambridge. The route is not finalized and there's no money to launch trains. Craig figures train remain 10 to 20 years away if they ever arrive.
"We have to be realistic," they said. "These buses will carry us to that point, if in fact there's a transition to trains."
Transit passengers praised the new Ion buses.
"I'm really liking the fact that I can plug in my phone to charge," Chris Wiedemann said.
"It's comfortable. It's nice-looking. I think everybody's going to enjoy it once it starts up and running," Rob Hoffman said.
They anticipate using Wi-Fi to check their transit app to see when their next bus arrives.
If such a bus was running earlier, Kim Moore might have thought harder about trading transit for the minivan they now use to shuttle their two young children.
"I used to be a very loyal transit rider," Moore said. "I like the fact that it's got Wi-Fi, it's got chargers for your phone, it's stepped up to the new millennium."
Sheri Orth figures headrests will help them son, who often falls asleep riding the bus.
"It looks comfortable," they said.
Melissa Webster figures she'll now be able to use their phone more often, to drown out bus noise that disrupts their hearing aids.
Local residents ride transit at a below-average rate among the nine largest transit systems, taking 44 transit trips per person in 2016. That's down from a peak of 50 trips per person taken in 2013. Ridership in 2017 appears unchanged.
The ridership plunge after 2013 is by far the steepest among major Ontario systems, heading into the biggest transit expansion ever seen in this region.
Planners blame the plunge on factors such as lower gas prices, construction detours, a provincial transit downturn, changes in student housing, and changes to high school transportation. Ridership fell even as transit service expanded.
Local transit is volatile in part because it relies heavily on students who are the bulk of its passengers. The service attracts few stabilizing commuters, benchmarks indicate.

Space tourism, Hyperloops , AI voice activated smart speakers and driverless cars – the current rate of technological progress and exploration can make the present seem like the sort of sci-fi future that we once only dreamed of. But as these dreams become reality, it's increasingly obvious that science fiction has become the chalkboard for tomorrow's inspirational technologies. But what of science fiction itself? Where do we find the roots of its family tree? The speculative, future-gazing works of one nation arguably now stand above all others as the greatest font of inspiration.
Luc Besson on sci-fi storytelling The most important thing is what you're saying. It's not so much what is the tool you're using to say it, I'm more concerned about what we are saying. Is it a good story? Is it a good film? Then it doesn't matter if you see it on a small screen or a big screen. You have some big films coming from books, and you have people who've never read the books, they have seen just the film. That's OK! It's still the same story, if the story is good it's good. No one is complaining, asking 'why didn't you read the book?' It's OK, you can read the book or watch the film or do both. A story is a story, and the storytelling will be always the master of the thing for me.
The moment Georges Méliès rocket crashed into the eyeball of our nearest celestial neighbour in 1902's A Trip to the Moon could have been seen as a French national flag planting ceremony in the new found land of sci-fi cinema. For more than a hundred years the nation's artists and directors have taken us on fantastic voyages through space and time, from Méliès moon to this summer's blockbuster Valerian by Luc Besson, whose subtitle promises to show us “The City of a Thousand Planets.”
Literary launch
It's a tradition however that was rooted first firmly in literature. Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon, the inspiration for Méliès' seminal silent movie, sees the master of adventure conjure an American trip to the moon a century before NASA managed the journey for real.
Though its concept of firing men to the moon in a giant cannon seems disastrously dangerous today in the age of SpaceX and Blue Origin Verne's calculations elsewhere are surprisingly prescient – right down to the cannon's construction site being imagined close to where the real-world Kennedy Space Center now exists.
Georges Méliès 'A Trip to the Moon', 1902
Verne would dabble in science fiction regularly throughout their working life. Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, first published in 1870 brought us the impossibly cool Nautilus submarine, pretty much single-handedly inventing steam punk and given a liberal tip of the hat by Besson in Valerian's spectacular underwater scene. It's an aesthetic that's been heavily mined in games like Dishonored 2 , and has informed a modding scene looking to add some historical, brass-flourished glamour to the current tech world. Verne's 1874 novel Journey to the Center of the Earth could even be seen as a proto-Jurassic Park, with its character encountering prehistoric wonders such as the Mastodon and Pterosaurs.
Though Verne is the best known today, they inspired sci-fi contemporaries including Maurice Renard and Charles Derennes (whose pulpy 1907 The People of the Pole, with its tech-savvy reptilian civilisation, is ripe for a ‘re-imagining') among countless others around the globe.
The French literary sci-fi well dried up a bit in the middle of the 20th century. It wasn't, however, completely spent before Pierre Boulle delivered their 1963 novel Planet of the Apes, that most-oft revisited of speculative worlds, itself enjoying a silver-screen renaissance this summer with War for the Planet of the Apes, the concluding part to the CGI, motion-capture-heavy, Andy Serkis-led reboot trilogy .
Comicbook comeback
But one area in which the sci-fi page-turners again began to flourish, and were to become more inspirational than ever before, was in the blossoming pages of the comic book.
Leading the charge were writer Pierre Christin and artist Jean-Claude Mézières. Their comic Valérian and Laureline, first published in Pilote magazine in 1967 had it all – a menagerie of alien races, luminescent planets, time travelling special agents and a healthy dollop of sex appeal.
Valérian and Laureline from writer Pierre Christin and artist Jean-Claude Mézières
“My first introduction to science fiction was Valérian and Laureline”, says director Luc Besson, taking the reins on this year's cinematic adaptation of the strip.
“I was ten years old. Every Wednesday there was a magazine called Pilote in France, and there were two pages of Valerian every week. It was the first time I'd seen a girl and a guy in space, agents travelling in time and space. That was amazing.”
The ‘lived-in' look of the Star Wars films can be traced back to Valérian and Laureline's functional-but-fantastic approach to design, while the liberally-minded, socially-progressive way that each alien race had more or less a level footing in the eyes of Valérian's world can be seen replicated in the Mass Effect videogame series .
Whether the Mass Effect team at Bioware were actively fans or guided towards this view of intergalactic equality through Valérian and Laureline's copycats across the decades is unknown, but in the case of Star Wars, the similarities are too many to be mere coincidence; clone armies, bloated crime lords on floating barges, metal bikinis, carbonite-like restraining methods and a penchant for single-biome planet-hopping – all escapades that graced the pages of Valérian and Laureline before Skywalker ever got off their moisture farm. Indeed Doug Chiang, design lead for The Phantom Menace, is said to always keep a few Valérian and Laureline volumes to hand.
Valérian and Laureline wasn't the only place for Francophiles to get their sci-fi fixes from though. There was perhaps no book more influential than sci-fi magazine Métal Hurlant.
Issue 1 of Métal Hurlant
Published as 'Heavy Metal' in English-speaking corners of the world, it was created in collaboration by comic artists Jean Giraud (aka the inimitable ‘Moebius') and Philippe Druillet, writer Jean-Pierre Dionnet and money man Bernard Farkas. It'd propel its creators to cult-superstardom and offer a platform to some of the most creative sci-fi minds in Europe, from Enki Bilal to Alejandro Jodorowsky (whose failed attempt to bring Frank Herbert's Dune to cinematic life is so legendary as to have inspired a fascinating documentary of its own).
“It was a really great time for creativity,” reminisces Besson.
“In fact my first job was selling a script to Heavy Metal – I was in it, it was four pages and I was so proud.
“All these guys, Mézières, Christin, Bilal, Moebius, Druillet, in the 70s they were insane. I don't know what they were smoking (I've never smoked in my life), but they were very free. They were exposing society and showing other things. It was very full.”
Moebius the master
If you've enjoyed science fiction in any medium over the past 40-odd years, either the direct work of or at least the spirit of Moebius can be seen running through it. From Studio Ghibli's Hayao Miyazaki to Neuromancer author and VR-visionary William Gibson , many have admitted a love of Jean Giraud's stories and art.
From their shorts in Métal Hurlant to longer works like Arzach and The Incal (a collaboration with Jodorowsky), Moebius's striking use of color, intricate detail and sheer creativity in conjuring out-of-this world concepts made them an unparalleled force. Their tenure as flight attendant of Marvel's Silver Surfer character in the 1988 Parable series had a profound effect on the US publisher's output, especially in its “Cosmic” Marvel books that included Guardians of the Galaxy. Compare the pages of Moebius's output with the Guardians' big screen outings, or the recent Doctor Strange adaptation, and you can see that the psychedelic, vibrant and, most importantly fun tone owes the man a debt.
An otherworldly delight from Moebius
It was Jodorowsky who brought Moebius to the attention of Hollywood in the mid 1970s for their doomed Dune project, with the comicbook artist working alongside the likes of Alien designer H.R Giger and famed spaceship imagineer Chris Foss. While the epic movie would never be made (Jodorowsky was looking at an unbelievable running time of 14 hours with the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and Salvador Dalí in starring roles), a production “bible” was distributed among studios featuring the collected designs of the artists in an attempt to gain funding. The money never came, but the bible remained at the studios, where Moebius's, Giger's and Foss's designs would be quietly ripped off and reused in films for decades to come.
Moebius's time in sci-fi film would come though, with Tron, Alien and The Abyss being just a selection of films he'd work on directly before their death in 2012, aged 73 – the out-of-this-world nature of their designs inspiring filmmakers to continually push the technological boundaries of the medium.
Speaking of Moebius's influence, Blade Runner and Alien director Ridley Scott said in 2010, “You see it everywhere, it runs through so much you can't get away from it."
The film element
It's perhaps with 1997's The Fifth Element where the sci-fi “French connection” is seen in full force. Worked on by Paris-born Luc Besson on and off since they were aged 16, and inspired by their great love of the Valérian and Laureline comics of their youth, the director would pull together a dream team of Mézières and Moebius for production design, while flamboyant French fashion luminary Jean Paul Gaultier handled costumes. It's a million miles away from the often-dour approach that Besson's international contemporaries lean on as standard sci-fi fare.
“Everything is dark, it's raining, the superhero is wondering what he's going to do. ‘Am I going to save the world? Or not?'”, says Besson.
“God! Let's have some color! Let's have some fun! Let's at least imagine a better world. Maybe we won't be able to do it, but we have to try, otherwise we're going to just kill yourself right now. I'm very optimistic from that point of view.”
The Fifth Element's answer to Adele
The result was an extravagant, boisterous and comfortably playful romp across the galaxy – one in which a cameo from trip-hop star Tricky is somehow the least crazy thing about it. From its atmosphere-scraping tower blocks to its flying taxi cabs , its fetishistic dance-culture inspired costumes, two-dozen octave sky blue alien divas and space-cruising hotel ships which have almost certainly made it into a Virgin Galactic wish-list slideshow at some point, it threw more ideas at the screen in five minutes than some films manage in their entire running times – all shot through with the sense of optimism that's come to characterise much of French sci-fi over the ages. But it was a slow burner, not fully appreciated upon its original release.
“The Fifth Element didn't work in the US in fact”, recalls Besson.
“Leon either. Almost none of my films in fact, except Lucy, because Lucy was an American film in a way!
“The Fifth Element took almost 15 years to become a classic, and people are referring to it now, which is very funny for me. Why did you not see it in the first place? 15 years ago! So I guess it's just the way I'm telling stories is just different, same for Valerian. It's just different. I don't want to do the same, I just want to do my own painting.”
And so this summer comes, if not full circle back to Verne, but then a three-quarter circle from Valerian's comic book fathers to cinema's Luc Besson. The director's adaptation is a kaleidoscopic recreation of Christin and Mézières books, the result of giving a true fan an estimated $200 million (it's the most expensive French film ever) to make their dream vision come to life on the big screen.
As with their sci-fi films Lucy and The Fifth Element before it, it leaves nothing on the table, squeezing every color onto its palette and delivering eye-popping aliens of all shapes and sizes. It's Besson's biggest and most ambitious work to date (early scenes which sees the formation of a confederation of alien races, and another with a chase through a multi-dimensional street market, visible only through something akin to an AR headset , must be seen to be believed), and yet thoroughly faithful to its source material.
“Maybe it's our European side, but we're not too monolithic, we love to mix salt and sugar,” says Besson on the French sci-fi cannon they are now a leading light in.
“I don't know if there's a school of French sci-fi, but there's a real freedom.”
There are a few scant moments where an uncanny familiarity, a sense of déjà vu enters Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets – a serene Avatar-like alien here, a Stormtrooper-like guard there. And then it dawns on you – the French have been doing all this for years, the film a culmination of 50 years (if not more) of inspiration from across the Channel. The rest of the world has to make the jump to lightspeed just as an effort to keep up.

After months of rumors about a potential leap into politics, Cynthia Nixon announced she's running for New York governor with a campaign video they released Monday afternoon. The Sex and the City star is challenging Gov. Andrew Cuomo in September's Democratic primary. "Our leaders are letting us down," they say in the newly released video.
Nixon's announcement focused on the fact that they were born and raised in New York — "New York is my home. I've never lived anywhere else." But it also outlined their platform in the gubernatorial race, suggesting that education, poverty, health care, mass incarceration, and transportation will be major tenets of their campaign.
"I'm a proud public school graduate and a prouder public school parent," they say in the video. "I was given chances I just don't see for most of New York's kids today."
Rumors that Nixon would challenge Cuomo, who's seeking a third term as governor, began in August when The Wall Street Journal reported that progressive groups were encouraging Nixon to throw their hat in the ring. NY1 reported earlier this month that two former campaign aides to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio were helping the actor prepare to run for office, but Nixon hadn't confirmed a run until Monday.
Though she's never run for political office, she's not totally new to politics. They became an advocate for public schools in recent years, publicly criticizing both Cuomo and the U.S. education secretary, Betsy DeVos, for championing charter schools. "My sons Max and Charlie and the 2.7 million other school children across our state are counting on Cuomo," they wrote in a USA Today op-ed last March. "We ask again for him, at long last, to grant these students the education our state owes them. You can't claim New York will be a 'progressive beacon' unless you actually make it one."
Monday's announcement made it clear she's still dedicated to fighting for public schools over charter schools, as well as tackling the social and economic problems causing New York children to live in poverty. "We are now the most unequal state in the entire country, with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty," they say in their announcement video. "Half the kids in our upstate cities live below the poverty line. How did we let this happen?"
As for the other issues their campaign will center around, their announcement mentioned health care, mass incarceration, and New York City's failing subway system.
Them video also took subtle jabs at Cuomo without ever mentioning them by name. "We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us," they say. Them campaign website, on the other hand, didn't hold any punches. "Unlike the current leadership in Albany, Cynthia rides the New York subway nearly every day, and understands the toll that the mismanagement of the MTA is taking on everyday New Yorkers," it reads. (The site wasn't loading Monday afternoon, likely buckling under the high volume of traffic.)
The donation page they tweeted out as part of their announcement describes them as "a lifelong New Yorker and progressive activist who is running for governor to fight for a better, more equal New York." It further says they won't accept any donations from corporations, but will fund their campaign "by the people." Nixon's estimated net worth is $60 million, though it's unclear how much of their own money she'll use in their bid for office.
New York's Democratic primary will take place on September 13. Cuomo faced two Democratic challengers in 2014, ultimately taking 63 percent of the vote. This year, Nixon hopes to present a tougher challenge for the incumbent governor.

EDWARDSVILLE, IL – University student body presidents from around the country put out a statement in support of the student body at the University of Virginia.
On Friday night about 100 people carrying tiki torches, giving Nazi salutes and chanting slogans like ‘white lives matter' marched through the middle of campus at the University of Virginia.
Ramon DeShazer is the student body president at SIUE. In a group chat with other student body presidents, DeShazer and others, decided to put out a statement in support of the University of Virginia.
The statement reads, in part, ‘We are united with the students of the University of Virginia as what affects one of our campuses affects us all.'
Originally 50 student body presidents signed the statement. That is now up to 115 including the presidents from the University of Missouri and SLU.
As Student Body Presidents across the United States, we are deeply saddened by the events that have occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia. We are united with the students of the University of Virginia, as what affects one of our campuses affects us all. College campuses are spaces that students should be able to call home, not places of violence, hate, and racism. Students should always feel welcome and safe at our incredible higher education institutions, never having to fear for their personal well-being. As the voice of our students, we collectively call on one another to speak up in the face of injustice, as silence reduces us to bystanders in oppression. This is a statement to not only support the Student Body at the University of Virginia but to make clear our advocacy for the victimized and marginalized students on all our campuses. We will continue to support students and universities in their peaceful resistance to violence, racism, white supremacy, bigotry, and acts of terrorism on our own campuses and beyond. If the students of the University of Virginia or the citizens of Charlottesville need any assistance, please know you have a network of universities that supports you.

KSI has called out fellow YouTube star Logan Paul after stopping Joe Weller in the third round at the Copper Box Arena.
The viral video pair put an end to their rivalry once and for all after falling out over Twitter last year.
The bout had a planned six rounds of three minutes but was ended short when the referee intervened halfway through.
Following their win, KSI said: "If any YouTuber wants it they can come and get it. Jake Paul, Logan Paul, any of the Pauls I don't care. Bring it."

KSI also called out Rio Ferdinand who has decided to turn pro through Betfair.
Logan Paul made headlines recently with their vlog showing the dead body of a man who had committed suicide in the Aokigahara forest - or 'suicide forest' - in Japan.
The forest, on the slopes of Mt. Fuji, is said to be the world's second most popular place to take one's life.
While still filming, Logan can be heard saying things such as, "What the f**k is going on?" and, "It doesn't make sense bro."
(Image: YouTube/Logan Paul)
When filming the body from a few feet away, they then says to camera: “His hands are purple. They died this morning."
Paul received plenty of backlash with celebrities such as Sophie Turner and Aaron Paul hitting out at the 22-year-old.
They apologised for the video, which was watched six million times before being taken down.
YouTube subsequently said it had put future projects with Logan Paul on hold and dropped the star from its top advertising ranks.
Logan Paul has yet to respond to KSI's offer.

The Senate has begun investigation of the case of sexual harassment at the Obafemi Awolowo University involving a postgraduate student, Miss Monica Osagie; and a lecturer at the Accounting Department, Prof. Richard Akindele. The investigation was based on a motion moved at the plenary on Wednesday by Senator Abiodun Olujimi (PDP, Ekiti-South), entitled, ‘The Growing Trend of Sexual Harassment in the Higher Institutions of Learning: The Case of Monica Osagie.'
The lawmakers resolved to mandate the Committees on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND; and Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters “to carry out a full-scale investigation of the case of Monica Osagie and the OAU lecturer in order to ensure that there is transparency and accountability, and that satisfactory justice is done to the victim involved and our laws are further strengthened for effectiveness.”
They also asked the joint committee to “invite the OAU authorities to explain the steps they have taken and the outcome of their internal investigation on the matter as well as institutional reviews they have carried out, together with such further proposals aimed at nipping the problem in the bud.”
The Senate also urged the House of Representatives to quickly concur with the Senate's bill, Sexual Harassment in Tertiary Educational Institutions (Prohibition) Bill, which had been transmitted to the House “as this will provide succour and a window of solace for victims of these kinds of atrocities across the country in our higher institutions of learning.”
President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, in their ruling, recalled that the Senate passed the anti-sexual harassment bill in 2016, stating that the leadership of the chamber would ensure that the House concurs with it. Saraki added, “More importantly, we must make an example of this to ensure that we do a thorough investigation, and any member of the Obafemi Awolowo University found to be involved must be totally disciplined.
“We must really show that we do not stand for this; we are not going to tolerate it pending when the bill will be passed. We also commend the bravery of Monica Osagie for their efforts.”
Moving the motion, Olujimi said the Senate observed “the growing menace and culture of sexual harassment in our institutions of higher learning; and the psychological, physiological and emotional damage that perverts in our places of learning are bringing upon our children in school as a result.”
They recalled that it was for the reason that the Senate, in October 2016, passed the Sexual Harassment in Tertiary Educational Institutions (Prohibition) Bill, which prescribed “severe punishment for lecturers and academic staff of universities who either sexually harass or assault their male or female students.”
Olujimi said, “The Senate acknowledges that the case of the brave Nigerian and student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Monica Osagie, who, in an audio recording which went viral, was able to expose their lecturer demanding for sex in order to increase their grades. “This has further brought home the point, further justifying the specificity and target of the new bill, and the need to ensure that this perversion is completely kicked out of our places of learning.
“The Senate understands that the university authorities have since weighed in on the matter to ensure that justice is done. It notes that this is another matter that must not be swept under the carpet of expediency, forgetfulness or deliberate abandonment. “The Senate notices further that this particular case deserves greater scrutiny and attention as it signposts how serious we are as a nation to fully and exhaustively eliminate this perversion from our schools.”
Seconding the motion, Senator Olugbenga Ashafa (APC, Lagos-East), said, “We cannot pretend that sexual harassment do not exist in our higher institutions. This is an age-long behaviour on the part of lecturers particularly. There have been several reported cases of sexual harassment which have been swept under the carpet.”

Monrovia - Behind closed door with journalists disallowed, Associate Justice and Justice in Chamber of the Supreme Court Philip A.Z. Banks, III has ended a hearing into the Writ of Certorari filed to the high court by state prosecutors.
Report by Kennedy L. Yangian This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.
Associate Justice Banks last week at the start of the hearing asked all journalists who had assembled at the Supreme Court for the hearing to leave, claiming that the hearing was a conference intended only for the parties to the case.
However, sources closed to the hearing have said that it started on Thursday, April 13, 2017 ended Monday, April 17, 2017 at the Chamber of the Supreme Court with Justice Banks asking all parties to the case to present their legal memorandum.
No date was set for the ruling but a source indicated that the legal memorandum from the parties will pave the way for the determination of the case.
Justice Banks' hearing has grown out of writ of certiorari filed to them against the latest ruling in the case by Judge Yarmie Gbeisay to temporarily admit into evidence an e-mail presented by the prosecution.
The writ of certiorari by law is a writ filed to the high court by the prosecution against the judgment of judges of subordinate courts.
Prior to the temporary admittance of the e-mail into evidence, Judge Gbeisay stated that they were temporarily admitting the e-mail until the witness linked to the e-mail can come and testify to the e-mail, citing Article (21) (a) of the Constitution as the basis of their ruling.
In the writ of certiorari, Chief Prosecutor Cllr. Daku Mulbah asked the Supreme Court to have Judge Gbeisay rescind their ruling, arguing that the ruling of Judge Gbeisay to temporarily admit the e-mail evidence was an inadvertent error.
The controversial e-mail which prosecution says is very cogent among its evidence is reported to have been exchanges between co-defendant Varney Sherman and Sable Mining executives which has been acquired from an executive of the Sable Mining Hans Van Niekerk in South Africa.
Defense lawyers have counter argued for the Judge not to allow the e-mail into evidence on claims that the e-mail attributed to Cllr. Sherman was hacked.
Defense lawyers further contended that under the best evidence rule, before a document is admitted into evidence, a witness must appear before the court to testify to the document.
This is not the first time prosecutors have filed a writ of certiorari against the ruling of the judge to the Supreme Court.
In 2016, state lawyers filed another writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court then Justice in Chamber Jamesetta Wollokollie when Judge Blamo Dixon ruled and partly disbanded three jurors of the 12-member panel accused of tampering in the economic sabotage case against former boss of the National Port Authority (NPA) Matilda Parker and Comptroller Christiana Paelay.
Associate Justice Wolokollie ruled and disbanded the entire jury but the case is yet to be ruled to trial while it is pending before the full bench of the Supreme Court for adjudication.
Chinese smartphone maker Gionee on Saturday said the company is not scaling down its operations in the country but quickly added that it is restructuring its plans for India. the market share of the company is dwindling over the last two years.
Reacting to an IANS report that financial woes in China may hit Gionee's India operations, David Chang, Global Sales Director, Gionee India, said that Gionee will remain in the Indian mobile market. "We are in the process of restructuring our India team and executing a completely different business model for the brand in the market very soon," Chang told IANS.
Sources told IANS on Friday the company may scale down its operations in India and introduce a different business model to ramp up growth.
"We are equally excited about our presence in the Indian market and would like to assure all Gionee lovers that the brand is here to stay," Chang added.
The company had 2.2 per cent share in the Indian smartphone market for 2017, according to Counterpoint Research.
Gionee, which established its presence in India in 2012, claims to have retail presence in over 42,000 stores and has 600 exclusive service centres in the country. It also claims a customer base of 1.25 crore in the country.
The company has also been aggressively pushing for sports sponsorship.
Chang also refuted reports in the Chinese media that the company is facing financial woes in paying its suppliers.
"Recently, on 16th January 2018, some slanderous information about Gionee's senior executive was reported on social media, in an attempt to malign the reputation of the company," Chang told IANS.
"We, hereby, announce this information is proved to be untrue," the Gionee executive added.
Chinese media outlets reported last month that a local court has frozen 41.4 per cent stake of Gionee Chairman and Chief Executive Liu Li Rong for two years.Although the exact reason was not made public, reports said it was because of the "gambling debts".
"Gionee continues to hold a market share of 3.3 per cent in China and is determined to grow steadily over the years to come," Chang noted.
Back in India, after running domestic operations for almost five years, Gionee India's CEO and Managing Director Arvind Vohra stepped down last August. Vohra still continues as Executive Director.
Last year, the company announced it would invest Rs 500 crore in a new manufacturing/assembling unit in Faridabad, Haryana, but there was no news after that.The company also makes/assembles handsets at a Foxconn plant in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh.
On January 9, Gionee sent out a teaser to the media, revealing its plan to launch another smartphone in India soon. No launch date was shared thereafter.
The last device Gionee brought to India was selfie-centric "S10 Lite" for Rs 15,999 on December 22 last year.
OPINION
I've written an online ethnic dining guide to the Washington area for over 20 years, and I find food a useful way to grasp how rapidly this country can change. These days, a lot of the biggest trends just aren't on most people's radar screens.
The first and most striking dining development is the rise of Chinese regional cuisine. There are now Nanjing, Shanghai, Uighur, Shanxi, Taiwanese and other regional restaurants readily available. Real Hunan and Sichuan offerings are plentiful, in contrast to the thousands of nominally Hunan and “Szechuan” restaurants that have been around for decades. Cantonese food too now bears some resemblance to the real thing. The underlying reality is significant: The Chinese are now the second most numerous immigrant group arriving into the US, behind only Mexicans and catching up rapidly.
Filipinos are the US' second largest Asian minority, and finally, after years of invisibility, Filipino restaurants are an active and growing part of the local dining scene. One of the best “fancy” restaurants in Alexandria, Virginia, serves an off-menu Filipino fixed price option in addition to its regular fare.
Relatively populous countries are making their mark on the American dining scene, including India and Pakistan. Another rapidly growing set of restaurants comes from Ethiopia and Eritrea. This too reflects the US' likely future, as a landing point for some of Africa's large and growing population, much of its Muslim. It's striking how well this migration has proceeded, and how many East Africans are investing in education or starting businesses.
There's also a mini-boom in restaurants from Yemen, five in the region at my last count, up from none 10 years ago. That reflects trouble in the home country. Sadly, Yemen is wracked with cholera, has been falling into political chaos and is the major site for the Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy war. Thousands of people have been killed by the fighting. It's one of the most significant issues in the world, although most Americans don't much seem to care.
Contrary to what many people will insist, it's now possible to eat excellent Mexican food, including tacqueria-style tacos, in DC, Northern Virginia and nearby Maryland. But this is not the result of a sudden influx of Mexican migrants into the dining scene. Rather, earlier Mexican migrants are assimilating, opening larger businesses and spreading quality versions of their food to more parts of this country, just as hamburgers and pizzas earlier transcended their regional origins. This development is consistent with research showing that Mexican-Americans are assimilating more rapidly than previously we had thought.
The DC area also has some stagnating ethnic cuisines. Vietnamese food has continued to penetrate the market in Texas and Oklahoma, but in the Mid-Atlantic region mainstream Vietnamese restaurants seem to be in slight retreat. Vietnamese pho soups and banh mi sandwich shops are popular, and those dishes are feeding into fusion cuisine. But the full-menu restaurants don't compete well with Thai and Chinese offerings. I am reminded of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, which decades ago had fine and reasonably authentic German restaurants, but now they are mostly gone or are shells of their former selves. In the DC area, Bolivian is another cuisine that's holding steady but not advancing in either the number of restaurants or the popularity with non-Bolivian customers.
The broader lesson is that America isn't going to become endlessly more diverse, whether in its culinary offerings or otherwise. There are natural limits to these processes, and some are self-reversing as immigrants either assimilate or reach a peak influence on the broader American culture. In dining markets for the last 10 years as a whole, I would say the biggest development has been the spread of high-quality hamburgers and pizzas to all price ranges and dining styles, not the growth of cuisines cooked by recent immigrants.
Other big lessons? Chinese and Mexican restaurants seem well-placed to exert the most influence on the US dining scene over the next 10 to 20 years. Both are populous, diverse countries, and Mexico has the advantage of proximity. With African and Filipino cuisines, both from populous regions, improving their position in the market, perhaps numbers matter after all. I love the food in the Faroe Islands, but it isn't the future for American dining.

#JamesGunn pulled something off we never saw coming: They made a successful Guardians of the Galaxy film that catapulted its D-list comic book characters to A-list status, establishing them as one of the MCU's flagship hero teams. Now, Gunn is looking to replicate that with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
Surprisingly enough, however, fans are already looking forward for #GuardiansoftheGalaxyVol3 (or maybe unsurprisingly, if you know how fandom works). A few months ago, Gunn sent fans everywhere into a frenzy when they revealed that a third Guardians adventure was already on the table. But they cautioned us they aren't sure about their return to the galactic franchise, due to the enormous time commitment that comes with a project like it. They then asked fans to, you know, actually enjoy Vol. 2 before worrying about Vol. 3.
Well, if you were worried about them not taking the director's chair once again for the cosmic side of the MCU, worry not, because Gunn took to Facebook to make a very important announcement.
James Gunn Is Returning To Write And Direct 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3'

Finally, it's official. The director began their message by recalling the numerous questions they get from fans:
"Of course I know some of the questions that come up a lot – [...] But the question that comes up perhaps the most is, 'What's the deal with 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3', and are you going to direct?'”
They revealed that their reluctance to return to the director's chair was because of their unwillingness to risk continuing the unfortunate trend in movie trilogies where it seems like the final chapter is always the weak link in an otherwise great journey:
"Before I was able to honestly answer this, I needed to know it was, in my heart, what I truly felt called to do. There is a history in Hollywood of haphazard endings to trilogies, and I didn't want to become a part of that dishonorable tradition of pretending the third one doesn't exist [...] I have never made choices in my career based on anything other than passion and love for the stories and characters, and I didn't want to start now."

After that explanation they finally confirmed what we've been hoping for a while:
"So, after many months of ruminations and discussions, I know the answer. I could save this answer for the first, random interviewer to ask me during the press junket but instead I thought I'd share it with the most important people in the Guardiansverse – you, the fans, who have been so incredibly supportive and enthusiastic over the past five years, it has moved me to tears on a regular basis. So, yes, I'm returning to write and direct 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'."
"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula – and some of the other forthcoming heroes – goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit. And, like in both 'Vol. 1' and 'Vol. 2', we will work on creating the story that goes beyond what you expect."
That's... quite incredible. But that's not all they gave us. They also revealed two pivotal details about the threequel:
Is There A 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3' Release Date Yet?

As with any announcements of this nature, you might have expected an idea of when the movie would hit theaters to be a mystery. Surprisingly enough, however, they revealed when we should expect the movie:
"Much of what's happened in the MCU for the past ten or so years has been leading, in a big way, to the Avengers' 'Infinity War'. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' will happen after all that."
With how packed the #MCU's slate is, we already knew the Guardians' third galaxy-saving adventure would not be coming until after #InfinityWar. But it's great to see Gunn and Marvel already have a timeframe in mind for its release. That means we could expect the film in 2019 but seems more likely that it will come in 2020. Which makes sense, as it was also three years between the release of the first one and #GuardiansoftheGalaxy2.
What Should We Expect From The Third Movie?

Gunn also revealed what we should expect in terms of storyline: It's all about closing chapters and starting new ones:
"It will conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond. I will be working side-by-side with Kevin Feige and the gang to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far."
So, while the path may not be set in stone yet for the threequel, #Marvel and Gunn have an idea of where they want to take the franchise, especially with new characters that last a long time.

They finished their message by reassuring fans that, just as before, the property is in good hands:
"I promise you, the fans, I'll do it all with integrity and love and respect for the characters."
It's incredibly exciting to know James Gunn is coming back to continue developing these characters. Despite the larger than life setting and storyline, they made the Guardians three-dimensional people who audiences could connect with while still delivering great visuals and action sequences.
I can't wait to see what they do with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. If you want to see more of Gunn exploring our favorite space a-holes, don't forget to check out #GuardiansoftheGalaxyVol2 once it flies into theaters on May 5, 2017.

The TV show Roseanne was cancelled swiftly this week because its star, Roseanne Barr, sent a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a Black woman who was an adviser to President Obama. Even before the firing, there were repercussions. Writer Wanda Sykes quit the show, and some of the cast tweeted their disappointment.

The whole debacle has been frustrating to watch. Applause rained on Disney, owner of the network ABC, for ditching its most-watched and thus incredibly profitable show. But Roseanne Barr has regularly made racist, transphobic and xenophobic comments. In 2013, they compared Susan Rice, former U.S. ambassador to the UN, to an ape — a standard racist trope about Black people. Disney and ABC knowingly hired a racist, and now we're meant to applaud their correction? When ABC rebooted the show Roseanne this year, it was meant to ask, with humour, what happened to families like the Conners? Immediately, however, the question became: what happened to Roseanne? In the new show, Roseanne the character is a Trump supporter, much like Roseanne the actor.

The network and its star took pains to distance the two. While real-life Roseanne is as reckless on Twitter as the president they admire, the televised version was a softer, more quotidian portrayal. The other characters, like Jackie their Clinton-supporting sister, gave context and edge. But what the show wanted to do — A Big Important Conversation — was not what it achieved. It could never escape the toxicity of the Trump association. One episode was lambasted for a joke that dismissed ABC's other shows with majority non-white casts like Blackish and Off the Boat. As the Atlantic's Connor Friersdorf noted: “The best version of the show could've been good for the country.” When it first aired, Roseanne was a breath of fresh air. The show took viewers into the home of the Conner family headed by Dan and Roseanne Conner, two working-class parents with a crew of kids and a wider family in tow. The heart of the show and, indeed, the family was the brassy and boisterous Roseanne played by Barr. It was a picture of the white working class, their successes hampered both by class and by their own self-sabotage. A family full of character flaws but loving nonetheless, with politics shaped by a mix of nihilism and apathy. More than that, it was funny.
But there is nothing funny this time. The show's rotten core is, as Roxane Gay wrote for the New York Times, “that having a major character on a prominent television show as a Trump supporter normalizes racism and misogyny and xenophobia.” No number of jokes can write around it. The president is a serial liar and obfuscator whose most direct attacks are aimed at the marginalized and racialized.  They are a man who called white supremacists marching in Charlottesville “some very fine people.”

In fits and starts, their administration has attempted to place a ban on Muslims travelling to America. Under Trump's rule, the Immigration and Customs enforcement agency has been empowered to wreak havoc on the families and communities of migrants. Most recently, ICE has separated children crossing the border from their parents. In one case, a judge accused the agency of lying. There has been a rise in racist violence, largely empowered by the fact that the commander in chief of the United States is a white supremacist. There is a cruelty there that cannot be made wholesome. Support for Donald Trump, from the red MAGA hat aesthetic to pull of the balesthetic, is inextricably linked to bigotry and racism. In January, Gallup found the president enjoys nearly three times as much approval (47 per cent) among white people compared to non-white people (16 per cent). Analysis after analysis has concluded that racism and people's attitudes toward race were a major predictor of support for the president. The faux-ironic racism (“It was a joke”) displayed by Barr and the type of racism enacted by the Trump administration are two parts of a whole. The minimizing kind expressed by the network when it first hired Roseanne is yet another. Years ago, when Donald Trump first began their birther crusade, all these elements were present. To some it was a joke, to others a valid crusade and to more it was mere entertainment. The well has long been poisoned. If you can't see that, the joke's on you.

Shanghai/Mumbai: Tata Communications Ltd will soon hive its property holdings into a separate company, which will subsequently be listed, capping a 15-year effort by the unit of India's largest conglomerate.
The value of the company's 773 acres of land parcels may be about Rs263 ($4.08) per share, or about Rs7,500 crore, according to ICICI Securities Ltd. The spinoff should take less than a few months as there is in-principle agreement among the parties involved, said Tata Communications chief executive officer Vinod Kumar in an interview last week.
“Around the corner is probably a better description,” Kumar said in Guangzhou, on the sidelines of a conference. “The government is supportive and they are keen to do it. So it's really paperwork.”
The company, which in October reported worse-than-estimated quarterly earnings, has been shedding non-core assets while bolstering its enterprise offerings. Analysts said that hiving off the property holdings should help its stock performance, which has trailed the benchmark gauge since early June and is near the bottom of a sectoral index.
Existing shareholders, including the Indian government, which holds 26% in Tata Communications, will get shares in the new listed entity. The new entity will receive land earmarked as surplus when Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd was divested by the government in 2002 and sold to the Tata group.
“Any quick resolution in the land monetization process would be an upside,” Bhupendra Tiwary and Sameer Pardikar, analysts with ICICI Securities, wrote in a 2 November note.
Tata Communications's shares have dropped 11.6% in the past six months, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 6.7%.
The spinoff of its land parcels will be a “key catalyst” for the stock's performance, according to a 26 October note by brokerage Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. The other big event would be “deal consummation” for Tata Teleservices Ltd's enterprise business, according to the report.
Tata Communications, which says it has the world's largest wholly-owned submarine fiber network, is considering buying the enterprise business and fixed line assets of Tata Teleservices—the debt-laden firm that sold its mobile-phone unit to Bharti Airtel Ltd in October.
“We are doing the due diligence,” Kumar said, without disclosing any valuation. “It's urgent because it's a good opportunity. I hope we have a decision on it in the next three months.”
Tata Communications is looking to sell some more non-core assets after offloading two last year.
It sold 17 data centres for $633 million in May last year and Neotel Pty for $428 million, a month later, to free up funds and pare debt. Its total borrowings have shrunk to 88 billion rupees as of September-end from Rs14,230 crore in March 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Its ATM business, housed in wholly-owned Indicash and generating $100 million in revenue, is being evaluated for sale. “We have done all the heavy lifting. That business needs investment to scale,” Kumar said. “So we have to decide do we invest here or somewhere else.” Bloomberg

Tuesday vs. Boston, 7:30 p.m.
WASHINGTON — As Boston Red Sox players donned red, white and blue outfits to celebrate a 3-0 victory on the 4th of July that completed a sweep, the Washington Nationals held a players-only meeting to discuss a fifth consecutive loss and the precarious spot they're now in beyond the halfway point of the season.
Done in again by small mistakes that get magnified in a stretch such as this, the preseason NL East favourites lost for the 17th time in 22 games Wednesday to fall below .500 for the first time this late in the year since being 60-61 on Aug. 21, 2015.
This time, it was a throwing error by Adam Eaton on a sacrifice fly in foul territory and a wild pitch by Ryan Madson (2-4) in a disastrous seventh inning that dropped the Nationals to 42-43 and kept them from making up ground on the division-leading Atlanta Braves.
"We're a good team and we're going to go out there and compete with anybody," said Bryce Harper, who went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.
"We just have to keep grinding and keep doing our thing and good things will happen. We've never been in this position before, and I think it's an exciting time for us. In years past, we've won the division by a lot of games. We're able to be behind right now and I'm excited to get there and test it."
Powered by struggling outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr.'s two RBIs on the sac fly and a ninth-inning double and a strong start by Eduardo Rodriguez (10-3), the Red Sox moved 30 games over .500 under rookie manager Alex Cora.
"We know where we're at, but we still have a long ways to go," Cora said. "(The Nationals) have a good team. They'll figure it out. I've seen that before from them. They struggle a little bit and they'll pick it up. They'll be in the hunt."
Bradley, who came into the game hitting .201, worked full counts on each of their at-bats that produced a run. They were hoping the ball Eaton caught deep in foul territory down the third-base line would go out of play so they could see another pitch but will gladly take the RBIs — the second time this season they have had two in a game without a home run.
"Just had to continue to battle and finally get a pitch I could handle," Bradley said. "Any time you can help the team win, it's a positive. It's good, any way you can do it."
Rodriguez struck out six in six scoreless innings, mixing their change-up and slider in more often to keep Nationals hitters off-balance.

Arsene Wenger has shown support for Jose Mourinho following the dressing-room spat that followed the Manchester derby.
Players from both Manchester sides clashed in the tunnel after Man City's 2-1 win over Man United, after Mourinho entered the away dressing-room.
Mourinho is said to have grown frustrated with the noise emanating from the room, and went to tell the City players to tone it down.
They became embroiled in an argument with Ederson before milk, water and bottles were thrown in their direction, although City chiefs refute this claim.

The spat came some 14 years after a similar incident occurred in the Old Trafford tunnel following a Man United win over Arsenal.
Pizza was thrown at Sir Alex Ferguson in the ruckus. Cesc Fabregas later admitted that it was they who threw the slice.
Discussing the clash after the Manchester derby on Tuesday, Wenger, who was Arsenal boss when the first spat took place, said: "It is part of the intensity.

"It can go overboard. It happened to us. It happened to us. Hopefully you commit 100 per cent to the pitch and are an angel after.

During a visit to the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea Monday, U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence warned Pyongyang that after years of taunting the U.S. and South Korea with its nuclear ambitions, “the era of strategic patience is over.” ( Lee Jin-man / The Associated Press )
OTTAWA—Sixty-six years ago this month, John Bishop was one of hundreds of Canadians who fought to keep the South Korean city of Seoul from falling back into North Korean hands. The battle of Kapyong was a turning point in the Korean War, but as tensions escalate anew in the Korean Peninsula, Bishop isn't sure Canadians could play such a pivotal role in the region again. “I don't think Canada, no matter what we did or could do, would change the situation at all,” they said. “(U.S. President Donald) Trumponly listens to themselves and they keep changing their mind.” But so too has Canada, one former Canadian diplomat suggests.

Marius Grinius served as Canada's ambassador to both North and South Korea between 2005 and 2007. They said they would travel back and forth and share the information and observations they gathered in Pyongyang with Canadian diplomats as well as those from other countries. Then, under the previous Conservative government, Canada adopted a “controlled engagement” policy with North Korea. The move effectively cut off all diplomatic ties to the country and Canada lost its ear on the ground and the cachet that it could be using now, Grinius said. Canada's trade with Asia is booming and it has strong and deep cultural ties to the region thanks to the diaspora here, while the legacy of its wartime contribution lives on through the U.N. Korea command to this day, they said.
“But we, Canada, have been running hot and cold for decades in terms of substantive commitments on the security side and we should be very interested in long term stability and security,” they said. North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and 24 ballistic missile tests last year, defying six Security Council resolutions banning those activities, and it has conducted additional missile tests this year including one that failed last weekend. That weekend test loomed over a visit Monday by U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence to the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea, where they warned Pyongyang that after years of taunting the U.S. and South Korea with its nuclear ambitions, “the era of strategic patience is over.” Read more: Mike Pence stands at Korea border and warns North, U.S. ‘patience is over' On North Korea, Trump must get beyond bluster: Editorial North Korea has responded by accusing the United States of turning the Korean Peninsula into “the world's biggest hot spot” and creating “a dangerous situation in which a thermonuclear war may break out at any moment.” The country's deputy U.N. ambassador also said the Trump administration's deployment of a nuclear carrier task group to waters off the Korean Peninsula again “proves the U.S. reckless moves for invading (North Korea) have reached a serious phase of its scenario.” For their part, Korean War veteran Doug Finney said the suffering of the North Korean people — and the risk the same could befall South Koreans if outright conflict resumes — is the reason Canada must act. Some international aid agencies estimate that about 41 per cent of the North Korean population are undernourished and roughly seven million people are believed to lack access to clean drinking water. Otherwise, the legacies of the 27,000 Canadians who served in the war and the 516 who died is at risk, Finney said. “I can't see us standing by now and not doing anything,” they said. Canada does bear humanitarian obligations, said Tina Park, co-founder and executive director of the Canadian Centre for the Responsibility to Protect and a longtime scholar of Canada-Korea relations. As an architect of the responsibility to protect doctrine, a political commitment made by all UN member states to prevent crimes against humanity, Canada ought to address the fact those crimes are being committed in North Korea, they said. “If we really mean Canada is back, this is a prime time for the Canadian government to show what we mean by responsibility to protect,” they said.

Haley: Trump's accusers of sex misconduct should be heard
WASHINGTON (AP) – The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday that women who accuse someone of sexual misconduct deserve to be heard, even if it involves President Donald Trump.
“I know that they were elected, but women should always feel comfortable coming forward. And we should all be willing to listen to them,” Nikki Haley said on CBS' “Face the Nation.”
Trump, a Republican, won the White House last year despite the election season release of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape in which they described grabbing women's private parts, followed by accusations by several women of aggressive sexual misconduct. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has since reiterated the White House's position that the women who accused Trump of sexual harassment are lying.
On Sunday, Haley, who was the first female governor of South Carolina, praised the courage of women who have raised complaints of harassment in various industries, including government and Hollywood, saying they will “bring a conscience to the situation.”
“Women who accuse anyone should be heard. They should be heard and they should be dealt with, and I think we heard them prior to the election,” said Haley, a Republican. “I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.”
Asked whether Trump's election settled the issue, Haley said it was “for the people to decide.”
The wave of allegations has brought down powerful figures, including the resignations last week of Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz.
LOS ANGELES—Marvel's continuing space opera Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has yet to hit theatres, but plans are already in the works for the third installment.

Canada will seek a freer market for government procurement and wants to ease labour mobility across the borders, said Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland on Monday at a public forum in Ottawa. ( Sean Kilpatrick / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
OTTAWA—Canada's trade pact with the United States and Mexico has been an “extraordinary success” but unless action is taken to better spread the economic benefits, Canadians will lose faith in free trade and globalization, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says. Freeland used a Monday morning speech to lay out the broad strokes of Canada's objectives going into negotiations for a new North American Free Trade Agreement. They gave a strong defence of the need for free trade and a modernized agreement but delivered a strong warning that unless deliberate steps are taken to better spread the economic wealth of improved trade, divisions will grow in Canadian society. “There are too many communities in our prosperous nation where people do not feel prosperous — where they instead feel left behind by an economy that is increasingly divided between the wealthy one per cent at the very top, and everyone else,” Freeland said, according to a prepared text of their remarks. “If we don't act now, Canadians may lose faith in the open society, in immigration and in free trade – just as many have across the Western industrialized world,” Freeland told an audience at the University of Ottawa.

“This is the single biggest economic and social challenge we face. Addressing this problem is our government's overriding mission,” they said. In sketching out Ottawa's objectives, they said that the 23-year-old trade agreement needs to be modernized to address the changes in e-commerce and the digital economy. They said it must be “progressive” through safeguards for labour, enhanced provisions for the environment, a chapter on gender rights and improved relations with Indigenous peoples.
Canada wants to reform the investor-state dispute settlement — criticized for allowing foreign companies to undermine elements of government policy — to underscore that governments have an “unassailable right” to regulate. They said that Canada will seek a freer market for government procurement and wants to ease labour mobility across the borders. Freeland also said that Canada will seek to preserve elements of the current deal that it sees as “key,” including the country's system of supply management and a process to ensure anti-dumping and countervailing duties are applied fairly. “But we are committed to a good deal, not just any deal. That will be our bottom line,” Freeland said. Freeland took aim at one argument that has hung over these trade talks — the concern that NAFTA has cost Canada and the United States well-paying manufacturing jobs that have gone to Mexico. But Freeland warned against what they called “scapegoating.” “Although economic globalization has put pressure on some of our jobs, automation and digitization have been far greater factors,” they said, adding that even more technological changes lie ahead. While such innovations are “broadly positive,” it can only happen if the “gains of trade are fairly, broadly shared. “We must share the fruits of trade,” they said, citing lower taxes for the middle class, investments in education and training and the Liberals' child benefit. “This is the all-important, connecting piece, the tie between free trade and equitable domestic policy,” they said. They said that free trade has not always been accepted as a good thing, noting the opposition that surrounded the original Canada-U.S. free trade deal in the late 1980s. “Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, to give credit where due, staked their prime ministership on getting free trade passed. And they were right,” Freeland said. “Two decades on, in our country, that debate is settled because the results are plain,” they said. Since 1994, when NAFTA took effect, trade among the three nations has tripled, they said. “Thanks to NAFTA, the North American economy is highly integrated, making our competitive in the global marketplace and creating more jobs on our continent,” they said. Freeland spoke to an audience of 80, including senior Global Affairs officials, invited stakeholders and students and faculty at the University of Ottawa's Centre of international policy studies.

These Trump voters disagree on what that should mean Meet NAFTA negotiator Steve Verheul — the most important Canadian you've (probably) never heard of Among those in the audience Derek Burney, a former ambassador to Washington who warned last week that Canada could be in for a bumpy ride in the negotiations due to the political rhetoric of President Donald Trump. Burney advised the government to keep in mind that “no deal is preferable to a bad deal,” and to be prepared to know “when and how to say no.” Freeland noted how Global Affairs began laying the groundwork for the coming talks a year ago, when NAFTA become a hot topic in the U.S. election. Since then, Canada has mounted a “full-court press to preserve everything good about NAFTA for Canada, and also to find what elements of the deal can be improved,” Freeland said. Following their speech, Freeland was headed to Parliament Hill to speak to a parliamentary committee on the coming talks.

Intensive horticulture is prolific in the Dirty Creek region of the Orara Valley.
OPINION: The proliferation of white netting and plastic covered igloos that are springing up across the region is hard to ignore as the flourishing blueberry industry takes off.
Bringing "jobs and growth" to the North Coast, this type of intensive horticulture is receiving strong support from governments at all levels.
However, the industry is almost totally unregulated, allowed to clear what is termed regrowth forest, build enormous dams, and transform rural landscapes into a 'sea' of plastic without the need to seek any approvals whatsoever.
The problem is, blueberries are largely grown hydroponically, and so are highly dependent on water, hence the huge dams to capture the 10% of rainfall run-off that each landowner is entitled to.
Last year an international consortium purchased a large grazing property adjoining the Orara River and announced their intention to set up Australia's largest blueberry farm, 850 hectares.
They are entitled to capture 90 megalitres (ML) of rainfall run-off and have applied to extract an additional 66 ML/year from the Orara.
However, blueberries require between 2 and 3 megalitres of water per hectare annually, so already they have an annual water shortfall of close to 2,000 ML.
Since declaring their plans for the mega-plantation, the same consortium has reportedly purchased another property of similar size nearby, and are currently preparing that land for planting.
We also have other blueberry farms starting up at Glenreagh, Kremnos, Halfway Creek, Kungala, Lanitza (north and south), and Qwyarigo, all within the Lower Orara catchment area.
Nobody appears to be giving any thought as to where the necessary water will come from, or what impact the damming of all first and second order streams will have on flows in the river itself.
The current total available water for irrigation from the Lower Orara is under 800 ML annually.
You don't need to be a mathematician to see the problem.

Blackcurrant-based hair dyes which use waste from the production of Ribena have been created by university scientists in Yorkshire, who now plan to sell the products commercially.
Around 90 per cent of Britain's annual blackcurrant crop is used to make the cordial, according to the manufacturer, with the berries harvested in the summer and pressed for juice.
A new technique, developed by scientists at Leeds University, extracts natural colouring from the leftover skins of the fruit to create sustainable hair dyes.
Colour chemist Dr Richard Blackburn said: “Because of issues and concerns around conventional dyes, we wanted to develop biodegradable alternatives that minimise potential risks to health and offer consumers a different option.”
Some ingredients found in common synthetic hair dyes are known irritants and can trigger allergic reactions. There have also been concerns over whether they could cause cancer, the researchers said, while the effects of dyes on the environment are unknown.
The skins of blackcurrants contain high concentrations of pigments that provide colour to many berries, flowers, fruits and vegetables.
Dr Blackburn said: “They are non-toxic, water soluble and responsible for pink, red, purple, violet and blue colours and are widely used as natural food colourants all over the world.”
The berries “represent a sustainable supply of raw material because of how much blackcurrant cordial we drink”, they added.
The technology developed by their team enables the pigment to be extracted from blackcurrants and to provide intense red, purple, and blue colours on hair. When mixed with natural yellow, it could also produce browns.
The colours are said to last for at least 12 washes, similar to other semi-permanent dyes.
Prof Chris Rayner, an organic chemist, said: “We've made it possible to have great hair colour, and to get it from nature in the most sustainable way possible.”
The researchers are commercialising the technology through a Leeds University spin-out company, under the brand Dr Craft. The dyes are expected to go on sale this summer.
But Premier Kathleen Wynne has said their Liberal government is increasingly concerned that the exemption on units built after 1991 , is leading some landlords to charge untenable increases, including a case reported in the Toronto Star recently in which a landlord told tenants that rents in their building would double to about $3,300 a month in July.
Rentals built before 1991 in Ontario are subject to annual rent increases of about 1.5 per cent.
Clamping down on rental increases in newer buildings puts 9,000 units and $2.7 billion in potential investment at risk, said Jim Murphy, CEO of the Federation of Rental-housing Providers of Ontario (FRPO).
That's the warning of the association representing 2,200 owners and managers of 350,000 rental units.
If the province expands rent controls to include units built after 1991, it will douse a renewed interest in building purpose-built rentals that is set to help ease the Toronto region's tight vacancy situation.
“Not all rentals are created equal. Affordable housing is a concern, but rent control is not the magic bullet,” said one survey respondent. “Rent control has contributed to the creation of the condo market.”
An unscientific survey of 14 of its members, who own or manage thousands of units in Ontario, found more than 90 per cent were planning future purpose-built rental developments. An overwhelming majority cited higher rents, the rent control exemption and low interest rates as key factors in those plans.
Although nobody is in favour of doubling rents, this isn't the time to clamp down on rents in newer buildings, argues FRPO because the number of rental starts rose 50 per cent last year over 2015.
Murphy said “the timing on post-1991 couldn't be worse in the sense that even the government wants purpose-built rental. They want it to be part of the solution and part of the overall housing mix.”
The association's survey report coincides with a Tuesday meeting by Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau, provincial treasurer Charles Sousa and Mayor John Tory to discuss possible solutions to the scorching real estate market that is making it increasingly difficult to buy or rent in and around Toronto.
Instead of applying the same rent controls to units built post-1991, the landlords association is recommending the government consider two alternatives:
A “rolling” 20-year exemption on newer rentals that would allow developers to get through one full life financing cycle of their buildings before provincial rent guidelines take effect.
A 10 per cent cap on the amount landlords can raise the rent in buildings built after 1991.
It is also suggesting that leases contain a clause notifying tenants what the allowable increase on their unit will be.
Since rent controls were introduced in Ontario in the 1970s, purpose-built rental development has been scarce, said Murphy. But lately the economic and regulatory environment is increasing rental stock.
According to the association's report, obtained by the Toronto Star, the total supply of new housing is critical to the availability of new rentals.
“Shortfalls in total housing production can be expected to have pervasive long-term negative effects for tenants (because of reduced movements to home ownership and because there will be fewer opportunities for homeowners to create accessory units within existing low-rise homes),” says the report by Will Dunning Economic Research.
The condo craze is also bolstering the supply of rentals on the market. If a third of the 43,725 condos expected to come online in the next two years are rented, that's 15,000 new units, according to the report.
Of 100,000 condos currently being rented in Toronto, 67,000 of them were built after 1991, said Murphy.
“There's no question rents have increased fairly sharply in the last four years,” said David Horwood, vice-president of Effort Trust, which owns between 20 and 30 apartment buildings in communities around Toronto such as Hamilton and Kitchener.
But they think smaller, less-professional landlords are part of the problem. One reason purpose-built rental development lags condos is that the risks are greater in the latter category, they said. Condo buyers can sell pre-construction contracts to help finance their projects. But rental developers have to wait for project completion before they see any return on their investment.
“The only real risk (condo developers) have is if the market crashes between the time they take these contracts and the time they deliver the building, it's possible some people will walk away from their deposits. But I don't think that's a real risk right now,” said Horwood.
After failing to build anything new since the 1970s, the third-generation family business is “finally at a point where we think we have a business case to build new,” said Horwood.
Effort Trust has five projects in the works that have taken five to seven years to develop. It expects building permits on two of them in the next three months — “providing we have certainty.”
“I want to build because I feel we can build buildings at a fair margin and build quality product,” said Horwood. “But I won't build it if I worry about three years out from now.”
It's not that the projects won't happen at all, “if we have a bad feeling about this,” they said. “But they'll probably go condo for sale because we don't want the risk. We'll share it with our purchasers.”
Toronto's mayor says they want to discuss with the province and Ottawa a proposed vacancy tax, increasing the supply of affordable housing and the need for better data.
“This is not a photo op,” said Tory of Tuesday's meeting with senior politicians.
“I think it's a very important first opportunity for the three representatives of the three government to sit in a room together and actually compare notes,” they said Monday.
Politicians at all levels have been meeting with “experts” about what is driving up the market and creating a lot of fear.
In those meetings, Tory said he's heard “there's an element of speculation that has found its way into our housing market that is helping push prices up.”
“Some of it is just caused by the desirability of living in Toronto but I think the key becomes to identify, who is responsible for that speculation and what could you do about it that was responsible and effective,” they said.
“I'm okay not being spoken about or written about or applauded or criticised,” Ranbir Kapoor, our June cover star, tells us in an exclusive interview. But it looks like 2018 is their year and all everyone wants to do is talk about him. First, there is Sanju – the highly-anticipated biopic based on the life of Sanjay Dutt– in which Ranbir Kapoor plays the lead. Then, there's talk about them and Alia Bhatt.
So when we sat down with them for an exclusive interview for GQ India‘s June issue, we simply had to ask: Are you dating Alia Bhatt?
“It's really new right now, and I don't want to over speak. It needs time to breathe and it needs space,” they told us. “As an actor, as a person, Alia is – what's the right word? – flowing right now. When I see them work, when I see their act, even in life, what they give is something that I'm aspiring to for myself. It's new for us, so let it cook a bit.”
“[Being newly in love] always comes with a lot of excitement,” they continue, “It's a new person, it comes with new beats. Old tricks become new tricks again – you know, being charming and romantic, all of that. I think I'm more balanced today. I value relationships more. I can appreciate hurt and what it does to a person much more than I could a couple years back.”
In the interview, Ranbir also opens up about the value of solitude, being selfish, and growing up. Read the full interview here.

MANCHESTER, N.H. -- President Donald Trump unveiled a wide-ranging and controversial plan to address opioid addiction during a Monday stop in New Hampshire -- one of the states hit the hardest by prescription drug, heroin and fentanyl-related deaths.
Trump returned to Granite State for the first time since 2016 to announce a new set of policies aimed at combatting the issue, including a contentious measure which could open some drug traffickers up to the death penalty.
The president, who repeatedly pledged to tackle drug abuse at 2016 campaign stops in New Hampshire -- said their plan would focus on three main areas: reducing opioid demand, cutting off the supply of drugs and increasing access to treatment services.
Flanked by administration officials, law enforcement officers and those personally impacted by opioid abuse, Trump told a crowd of guests invited to Manchester Community College that "we will defeat this crisis, we will protect our beautiful children."
Trump said their plan, among many things, looks to cut down on the number of legal opioid prescriptions and illegal drugs, expand access to addiction treatment services, launch a new website to help Americans struggling with opioid addictions and equip schools with overdose reversal drugs.
The president's plan would also allow the Department of Justice to seek the death penalty for some drug dealers -- a provision which has drawn criticism from Massachusetts lawmakers and others.
Arguing that drug dealers receive relatively light sentences despite killing "thousands of people in their lifetimes," Trump stressed that it's time the United States "get tough" and go after such individuals.
"If we're not going to get tough on the drug dealers, they'll kill thousands of people and destroy so many peoples' lives," they said. "We are just doing the wrong thing. We have got to get tough. This isn't about nice anymore ... this is about winning a very, very tough problem. If we don't get very tough on these dealers, that's not going to happen folks."
Trump further used the New Hampshire stop to push their controversial immigration policies and to call out places, like Boston and Lawrence, that have opposed their administration's efforts to crack down on "sanctuary cities."
Chelsea, Lawrence sue President Donald Trump over 'sanctuary city' order
U.S. Sen. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, however, slammed the president's opioid plan, contending it's "full of broken promises and failed policies."
"Extreme proposals like using the death penalty only perpetuate a harmful stigma associated with opioid use disorders and divert attention from meaningful discussions and progress on expanding access to treatment, recovery and other public health initiatives that are critical to saving lives," they said in a statement. "We will not incarcerate or execute our way out of the opioid epidemic. We are still paying the price for one failed War on Drugs, and now President Trump has drawn up battle plans for another."
Opioids, including prescription drugs, heroin and fentanyl, killed more than 42,000 Americans in 2016 -- more than any year on record, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
New Hampshire saw the third highest rate of drug overdose-related deaths among states in 2016, with 39 per 100,000. It trailed West Virginia and Ohio, which saw a respective 52 per 100,000 and 39.1 per 100,000 overdose-related deaths in the same year.
In response to those deaths, Trump launched the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis last March to examine steps lawmakers can take to tackle the issue.
The panel, which included Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, issued its final list of recommendations in November and urged Congress to immediately appropriate funding to implement its proposals.
President Donald Trump's Opioid Commission seeks federal block grants, immediate action in final report
The commission, among many things, recommended that federal officials: create an expansive, national multimedia campaign to highlight the dangers of opioid abuse, remove stigma as a barrier to treatment and cast addiction as a "chronic brain disease;" provide better addiction prevention education to students; and get federal funding support more quickly and effectively to state governments.
It also urged the Trump administration and Congress to "block grant federal funding for opioid-related and (substance use disorder)-related activities to the states."
US Sen. Ed Markey calls Trump administration's response to opioid crisis 'empty words, broken promises'
In addition to convening the commision, the White House named opioid addiction a public health emergency in October. The move drew criticism from Markey and other Democrats, who had urged officials to make the issue a national emergency and allocate new federal resources to response efforts.
Trump last visited the Granite State the night before their 2016 presidential election win, when they held a large rally at SNHU Arena in Manchester.
Their Monday visit came as the president faced criticism over their weekend social media comments on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading an investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.
Resource Center officials, along with representatives of 150 other organizations across the country, have signed a letter asking senators not to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The letter was written and sent by representatives of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights based in Washington, D.C.
The letter points out that repeal and reduction in Medicaid would leave 23 million people without health insurance, including 14 million who would lose coverage immediately. The new law would impact especially “individuals and families living in poverty, people of color, women, immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, individuals with disabilities, seniors and individuals with limited English proficiency.”
Medicaid, they point out, covers one in five Americans, one in three children and 10 million people with disabilities.
“We urge you to oppose any repeal of the Affordable Care Act, attempts to change Medicaid's open-ended funding guarantee into a block grant or per capita caps,” they ask senators now considering a repeal of ACA that may be voted on before Congress recesses for the 4th of July.

No one expects a stopgap to turn into a masterpiece. But that's what happened to George Frideric Handel when one of their collaborators, Charles Jennens, handed them some texts to set to music.
Messiah has, since its premiere in Dublin at Easter time 275 years ago, become one of the best-loved pieces of classical music in the English-speaking world. Toronto is no exception, becoming a virtual shrine to Messiah at this time every year.
The city's two flagship orchestras — the Toronto Symphony Orchestra on modern instruments, and Tafelmusik Orchestra on historical ones — present multiple performances every December. The two-hour oratorio, either in part or whole, is also heard in churches, cathedrals, schools and community concerts from the city core to rural villages.
“Handel says they will do nothing next Winter, but I hope I shall perswade them to set another Scripture Collection I have made for him, & perform it for their own Benefit (taking the bulk of the box office) in Passion Week. I hope they will lay out their whole genius & Skill upon it, that the Composition may excell all their former Compositions, as the Subject excells every other Subject. The Subject is Messiah,” wrote Jennens to a friend in July 1741.
Handel, who had been making a fine living as an opera composer and producer, had seen the tastes of their London audience shift. They didn't want Italian opera any more; they wanted something English. They wanted something more serious. They were at a loss, and was even considering moving back to their native Germany, when fate intervened with an Irish concert invitation.
WWE News: Reason why Finn Balor didn't return at WrestleMania 33
Despite being cleared to wrestle for "weeks" prior to WrestleMania 33, Balor didn't appear at the event. They explain why.
@desibrah by Dushyant Dubey News 14 Jun 2017, 21:57 IST
Balor had been cleared to wrestle weeks prior to WrestleMania 33
What's the story?
In an interview given to News.com.au, Finn Balor said that they were cleared to wrestle by the medical staff weeks prior to WrestleMania 33 and that they didn't perform at the event because there was no space for them on the card.
In case you didn't know...
Finn Balor was injured at SummerSlam 2016 in a match with Seth Rollins. The match was meant to decide the first-ever winner of the WWE Universal Championship. Despite being injured, the Demon King completed the match and became the first WWE Universal Champion.
Balor came out on Raw the next night, however, and was forced to relinquish their title on account of their injuries. They were subsequently out of action for 6 months and only returned to WWE television on the episode of Raw after WrestleMania 33.
The heart of the matter
During the interview, Balor spoke about a number of topics, including their injury at SummerSlam.
Balor stated during the interview that they knew the injury was bad almost immediately after they sustained it, but was determined to finish the match. Balor said that they didn't want to be remembered as “the guy who blew an opportunity at SummerSlam” and thus pulled their arm “back into place” and finished the match.
Also read: Why has WWE not given us The Shield vs. The Club?
Balor said that they have no regrets about continuing and finishing the match. They were quoted as saying:
“I wasn't about to sacrifice many years of hard work for a little bit of a scratch on the shoulder. Obviously, it turned out a lot worse than first expected, but the show must go on and I'm glad I did what I did.”
Balor ended up missing out on WrestleMania 33 due to their injury, however, they stated during the interview that they were medically cleared to wrestle “weeks prior to the event”. Balor clarified that the only reason they didn't return at WrestleMania was that there was no space on the card.
They were quoted as saying:
“It was quite an interesting scenario, because the reality was I actually was fit and I was ready and I was back wrestling, there was just no space on the card at WrestleMania,” Balor revealed. Obviously I had done my part in the rehabilitation, but it was kind of too late situating anything to do with the card. There was literally no space left, no opponents left, that was the reality of it.”
What's next?
Finn Balor has been wrestling on the RAW brand ever since their return from injury. They have stated that they would like to have a shot at the Universal title since they technically never lost it in the first place.
Even though Balor hasn't been booked for a match at the next RAW-exclusive Great Balls of Fire Pay Per View as of yet, the card is still incomplete, and Balor might be added to a match soon.
Author's take
Finn Balor's determination to finish the SummerSlam match despite the extensive nature of their injuries is absolutely admirable. It is, however, unfortunate that they missed WrestleMania 33. Their inclusion on the card would have made the show a much better spectacle purely due to their presence.
However, Balor is still on the up and up despite missing out on WrestleMania 33, and I'm sure that they will have a strap around their waist very soon.

5 alternatives to Ivan Perisic for Manchester United
A look at five players Manchester United should look as the Croatian is unlikely to leave Inter Milan this summer.
by Nathan Staples Top 5 / Top 10 14 Aug 2017, 18:07 IST
Gareth Bale
At the start of the window, Jose Mourinho admitted they wanted four new signings. Three have already joined, in the shape of Victor Lindelöf, Romelu Lukaku and Nemanja Matic, but the final recruit still seems to be eluding them.
It was reported that they were chasing Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic but since the Nerazzurri's new manager Luciano Spalletti admitted they were “strongly opposed” to letting the Croatian go, all interest seems to have faded.
With the Red Devils still likely to seek one more move before the window shuts, who should they seek to fill the void on the left-wing? Here's a look at five options that could boost their title ambitions.
#5 Gareth Bale
A few weeks ago, Jose Mourinho said this to journalists before the Super Cup against Real Madrid: “If they are on their way out of Real Madrid, well, I'll try to be waiting for them on the other side and try to fight with other coaches that would also like to have them on their team.”
As the Portuguese manager tries their best not to blush in front of the Welshman, it's not hard to see why Bale would be such an asset to Manchester United.
Almost akin to a left-footed Cristiano Ronaldo, the 28-year-old has the pace, power and skill to torment any defence across Europe. Injuries have been a worry in recent seasons but if they can keep a clean bill of health, he'd help spearhead an attack that was severely lacking in goals from other than the main striker last season.
Isco has signed a new, long-term contract and with persistent rumours of a younger model being attracted to the Santiago Bernabeu, maybe it's time for Bale to move on. Ed Woodward was desperate to have them when they first joined Los Blancos, so there would be no surprise in the fact they would jump at the chance to sign them again.
The five-day People's Tribunal on Economic Crimes kicked off on Saturday at Constitution Hill in Johannesburg with human rights lawyer Charles Abrahams as the first witness making a presentation on apartheid state secrets.
Firing the first salvo‚ they condemned the fact that the “new” South African democratic government should have been held liable for the debt accumulated by the apartheid regime.
They said that in 1993‚ during the transition period to a democratic South Africa‚ the apartheid regime's total debt was about $80bn‚ of which $45bn was public debt.
They said that when new governments take over they should not be obliged to honour debt amassed by oppressive regimes.
“I argue that the transition was a complete change from a criminal government to a democratic government. So it cannot be fair that the apartheid debt will be paid by the new government‚” they said.
They said that South African government should be asking itself how it could hold accountable the corporate entities that were involved in extending debt to the apartheid government?
They also bemoaned the fact that the ambit of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission‚ which was chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu in East London‚ did not extend to the corporate sector.
“The TRC did not sufficiently deal with issues emanating from the apartheid history‚ more specifically with apartheid economic crimes. I also think that the TRC recommendations should be revisited‚” Abrahams said. They said that the apartheid financial liabilities and obligations should not have been transferred to the new regime.
The tribunal‚ which one of the evidence leaders said is not a court of law nor has binding powers‚ will examine the continuities between apartheid-era economic crime; the post-apartheid arms deal and contemporary state capture.
The evidence is led before a six-member panel chaired by Zak Yacoob. The other panel members are Navi Pillay‚ Dinga Sikwebu‚ Mandisa Dyantyi‚ Yasmin Sooka and Allyson Maynard Gibson.
It was 2015 when CHVRCHES released their second album Every Open Eye and we haven't hrard from them since-until they made a sizzling comeback with a brand spankin' new song called “Get Out“—a collaboration with Greg Kurstin. “Working with Greg was so different to what we'd done before, but it also felt so comfortable and like he'd been in our band forever,” Chvrches said in a statement. “He doesn't try to make you write a certain kind of song. They just listens and then Jedi puppet masters the best work out of you. The opening synth riff of ‘Get Out' was the first thing to emerge on our first day in the studio with him.”
My butt is clenching just thinking about their upcoming third album Love is Dead and how it'll be out anytime soon!

Police are searching for two suspects involved in a Rochester robbery.
According to the Rochester Police, a group of teens is robbed at gunpoint early Saturday morning in the Hy-Vee Barlow parking lot. Police said, the two 16-year-old boys pulled into the parking lot in an '05 GMC Envoy. The teens were there to meet up with a 15-year-old boy.
When the 15-year-old got into the car, two other men came up and demanded money from the driver. One of the men had a handgun. The driver handed over the money and then the suspects told the two teens to get out of the car. The teens got out and the two suspects drove off with the car, money, their phones and the 15-year-old.
Officers were able to find the vehicle later at Ironwood Square.
RPD said the teen that was taken, never reported the crime to police, but the men dropped them off at the park.
The first suspect- who had the handgun is described as a 6' African American man, who was wearing a Chicago bulls jersey, red hoodie and bandana.

South Korea's Navy announced Thursday that it will conduct an exercise this week on defending the country's easternmost islets of Dokdo.The two-day training to kick off later in the day is part of efforts to defend Dokdo from the possible aggression of "outside forces," the Navy said.It was apparently referring to Japan, which claims the sovereignty over the Seoul-controlled islets in the East Sea.This week's practice will involve a 3,200-ton Gwanggaeto the Great-class destroyer and six other ships of the Navy and the Coast Guard, plus four naval and Air Force aircraft, including an F-15K fighter jet and a P-3C Orion patrol plane.A unit of marines will also stage a landing drill on Dokdo."The training this time will be similar to previous ones in size," a Navy official said.The Dokdo defensive exercise is a regular event held twice a year since 1986, based on the scenario of an external threat.It will be the first since the launch of the Moon Jae-in administration.Japan has strongly protested the training.On Seoul's reported plan for the drill, its Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida openly said in March, "It's regrettable and unacceptable" in light of the Japanese government's stance on the sovereignty over the islets.In addition, Seoul and Tokyo have been at odds over a controversial deal on the issue of Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women during World War II.Moon, a liberal leader who was a human rights lawyer, stressed that many South Koreans still disapprove of the 2015 accord to settle the decades-old historic issue with Japan's payment of 1 billion yen ($9 million) for dozens of victims who are still alive. Koreans believe Japan has yet to fully atone for its wartime atrocity. (Yonhap)

For the first time since the indoor Conference USA championship meet in February, the North Texas track and field team returned to track, this time at Texas Christian University to open outdoor season against 10 other schools from across the country.
After spending the past three weeks training, two Mean Green athletes finished their competitions breaking school records. Javier Lopez-Ibarra threw the javelin 66.55 meters, while Bailey Ashmore pole vaulted 3.96 meters.
Both of them finished the night with first place medals on a night where they set school-records were set. Head coach Carl Sheffield was impressed with the pair outing.
“We set a couple records in the pole vault and men's javelin,” Head coach Carl Sheffield said. “I think they were a little ahead of where they thought they were. They had a good couple week of training, Baylie Ashmore continues to improve every year [and] Javier Lopez is also doing well.”
Along with those two, North Texas had a couple other athletes who received recognition. Freshman Haley Walker ended up with a fourth-place finish throwing the discus 47.05 meters. Sophmore Kristyn Archuleta continued their dominance from indoor season and finished the night placing first in the javelin event where they made a throw of 48.54 meters.
In the 1500 meters event, North Texas had a strong showing from three of their runners Mike Lowe, Florian Lussy and Tim Jones finished placing second, third and fourth. The women's 4×100-meter relay team finished with a time of 45.66 and gave them a fourth-place finish.
In the end, Sheffield views the meet at TCU as a success considering how far they have come.
“I think it was a good meet overall,” Sheffield said. “We started off a lot farther ahead than we were last year from that standpoint it was pretty good. We had three weeks that we had to train for outdoors, so we got so that allowed us to really focus our thoughts and training. I think we were ready.”
Despite the successful showing by many members of the team, Sheffield says there's always room for improvement.
“We have to get better preparing for Conference USA,” Sheffield said. “One of our goals is to have more first-round NCAA qualifiers. If we do that we think we will have more people higher on the performance list in Conference USA.”
Next up: North Texas will participate in the Bobby Lane Invitational hosted by University of Texas-Arlington on March 23-24.

Hays Post
The Fort Hays State University Art Department removed several pieces of art from the walls of Rarick Hall after complaints the art was inappropriate for the children in Tiger Tots program that share that building. The artwork depicted women bare breasted.
Pastor Ron Pritchett of Ellis Baptist Church initially complained about the art after visiting the campus in February. They described the art as “pornographic” and “demonic,” in part because the presence of snakes in the artwork. Pritchett does not have any children enrolled in the Tiger Tots program. One alumnus also contacted the university about the artwork, but no parents of children enrolled with the program made complaints.
“We want to partner with Fort Hays and encourage education,” Pritchett said, “but we want to protect the children and their delicate minds and keep them from exposure to something inappropriate. I think it would be more appropriate if they moved the art to a different hallway.”
The artwork was created in a printmaking class at the university. Student artwork is regularly displayed in the hallways of the art department.
Karrie Simpson Voth, chairperson of the art department, said depiction of the human form is a regular part of the art department curriculum.
“There is no university policy of what students can and can't draw,” Simpson Voth said. “We encourage students to express what they feel in that moment. The instructor for the printmaking class chooses what goes up on the wall based on execution of good skill and technique.”
Simpson Voth said no harm was intended to the children.
“Our students are extremely talented. We hope the public can appreciate the artwork we produce. It's with the best of intention,” they said.
Tiger Tots is licensed for 24 children ages 2 1/2 to 5. Sara J. Stroup, Tiger Tots Nurtury Center director, directed questions to University Relations.
Lisa Karlin, director of University Relations and Marketing, said the university was sensitive the concerns being expressed and officials believed the issue had been resolved with the removal of the artwork.

Three medals for US Sailing Team at Aarhus Sailing Week

by US Sailing today at 5:34 amAs the test event, Aarhus Sailing Week 2017 was important for American athletes who came to Denmark hoping to learn more about the 2018 Worlds venue, hone key skills, earn roster spots on the US Sailing Team, and qualify for 2018 athlete support funding.“Of course, it was a great performance to come away with three medals here in Aarhus,” said Malcolm Page, Chief of U.S. Olympic Sailing. “Aarhus (Sailing Week 2017) was very important since one year from now, we will be here in these waters at the 2018 World Championships, which will be the first chance to qualify the country (in each sailing class) for the 2020 Olympic Games. We identified this regatta as one of two ‘performance events' for U.S. athletes in 2017, along with each 2017 class Worlds, where the results mattered for funding. It was great to see so many of our sailors come through under pressure.”
The first American medal of the event came on Saturday, as the new 49erFX team of 2014 Rolex U.S. Sailing Yachtswoman of the Year Steph Roble (East Troy, Wise.) and U.S. Match Racing National Champion Maggie Shea (Wilmette, Ill.) took bronze in the women's two-person skiff. Roble and Shea formed as a team in late 2016, after years sailing together on the international women's match racing circuit, and have been steadily participating in US Sailing Team camps and independent training sessions in 2017. Through their strong performance in Aarhus, the midwestern pair also qualified for roster spots on the US Sailing Team.
“We're excited to be a part of this whole journey to Tokyo,” said Roble, a two-time All-American for Old Dominion University who said they have long harbored Olympic ambitions. “We've been focused on boat handling and getting up to speed while sailing with our American training partners, Kate (Shaner) and Caroline (Atwood). It's been a very focused spring and summer for us, and we're just exited to be in regatta season now.”
In the Laser Radial, Erika Reineke (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) found their way to the podium after an impressive late-regatta surge that included a two, two, one, three scorelines to wrap up full-fleet racing prior to the medal race. The 2017 ICSA College Sailor of the Year for Boston College secured a silver medal in Aarhus after finishing third in the medal race.
“I'm really looking forward to this (Olympic quadrennium) because I won't be in college, and so I can put all of my efforts towards training and racing against some of the top girls (in the Radial),” said Reineke, the four-time ICSA College Women's Singlehanded Champion who also finished a career-best sixth at last year's Laser Radial Worlds. “This week was important, because I got familiar with this place and made it like home before the (2018 Worlds),” said Reineke.
In the Men's 470, Rio 2016 Olympians and national team veterans Stu McNay (Providence, R.I.) and Dave Hughes (Miami, Fla.) submitted a clutch performance this week, entering the medal race in a precarious points position but emerging as medalists following a tough battle with the Turkish, French and Austrian teams.
McNay and Hughes won the 2015 470 European Championship on these same waters in Aarhus, but noted that there was nothing about this venue that particularly suited the battle-tested pair. “We've managed to put two good regattas together here,” said McNay. “It's a very challenging place to sail, and you can't anything for granted. The wind is blowing off a nearby shore, which adds uncertainty. We call it ‘jungle ball.'”
Several other U.S. sailors submitted standout performances this week in Aarhus. The 49er team of three-time Olympian Chris Rast (Holland, Mich.) and Trevor Burd (Marblehead, Mass.) nearly came away with a medal, finishing in fourth following the skiff medal races on Saturday. In the Laser Radial, current Georgetown University collegiate athlete Haddon Hughes (Houston, Texas) finished in fifth overall, pairing with Reineke for a strong U.S. performance in the women's singlehanded fleet. Last, Burd and Hughes were added to the US Sailing Team roster by Chief of U.S. Olympic Sailing and two-time Olympic Champion Malcolm Page following their performance in Denmark.
For U.S. Olympic-class sailors, the focus will now turn to competing in class world championships in the late summer, and then to training and racing at the 2020 Olympic venue in Japan in the fall.
“With 2017 being the first year of the ‘quad,' going to Japan will be a great opportunity for our athletes to learn about the venue, learn about Japanese culture and get a feel for the waters there,” said Page. “Afterwords, every time our sailors are going to bed and thinking about Tokyo 2020, they'll have those memories from Enoshima (Japan), and be able to mentally prepare themselves for the Games.”

It's nighttime in a forest in the western Indian state of Gujarat. By the light of their cell phone, camel herder Jat Saleh Amir, 18, pumps milk from the teats of groaning camels. The milk smells strong, like gamey butter.­­­
Later, I join their family around a fire by grass reed huts. Everyone watches as I take my first sip of frothy camel milk from a steel bowl. I gag a little and smile apologetically – the milk is fatty, sour and salty. It's nothing like any milk I've had before. "Tell them I like it!" I elbow my local interpreter Liyakat Ali Notiyar. When nobody is looking, I slide Notiyar the warm bowl. Having grown up on camel milk, they slurp it clean in an instant.
Few Indians outside this district of Kutch and its community of camel herders drink camel milk. But that's about to change as one of India's largest dairy brands is set to mass market it. The milk will be sourced from this community of nomadic camel herders called Maldharis who roam the district of Kutch.
Maldharis have herded camels and consumed the animal's milk for centuries. They drink camel milk tea and serve it plain with breakfast, lunch and dinner. And they consider the milk a cure-all – they tell stories about camel milk curing everything from acid reflux to fever and pregnancy ailments. They also believe it can help manage diabetes. Elisha Harissa, 45, who has diabetes and lives in a nearby village regularly drinks camel milk. They claim it regulates their blood sugar. A few studies suggest there may be some scientific merit to these claims – camel milk seems to help regulate insulin secretion and blood sugar levels in patients with Type1 diabetes – suggesting it could potentially be used alongside other medical treatments to manage diabetes. However, scientists are still investigating the therapeutic potential of camel milk.
Meanwhile, Amul plans to market camel milk primarily to people with Type1 diabetes. And the company's managing director, R.S. Sodhi, is confident the product will succeed, especially given the growing number of diabetics in the country. But they acknowledge there will be challenges. The main reason: the taste. Indians may not take to the unusual taste of camel milk. Even Kutch natives used to camel milk, like Asmok Ghor, whose grandparents transported goods back and forth to Pakistan on camels, can only stomach the sour milk if it's boiled with sugar or concealed as ice cream. "I'm sorry," Ghor says. "It's not about the camels, I don't like the milk."
Sahjeevan is working with the local Kutch Camel Breeder's Association to market creative camel products, including camel milk soap and camel milk chocolate. A few years ago, they even brought a European expert to teach herders how to make camel milk cheese. Amed Taju says the chocolate was a hit among the herders, but the cheese didn't take off.
The success of Amul's efforts with camel milk may help determine the future of Maldharis. Government-imposed restrictions on grazing land in recent years, a decline in the camel-for-transport market and the mining industries' encroachment on grazing land have led to a decline in the number of camels owned by these communities. Amed Taju, a community elder, has had to sell many of their camels to get by. Now, their herd is half the size it was five years ago. Life is hard these days, says Taju. Their children aren't in school and they can't afford health care. "We are poor people," they say. "We are earning and eating, not saving."
This is where Amul can help, says Sodhi. Amul will purchase the milk for at least twice its current value, encouraging Maldharis to increase their herds. It won't be huge business for Amul, Sodhi says. "But for camel herders it will be big."
If he's able to sell camel milk routinely to Amul, Taju says they will build solid homes and send their grandchildren to boarding schools. "I see a future not for my sons and daughters," they say. "But for my grandson and granddaughters."

Developments in the Chinese technology sector, and cross-border investment, are opening important doors for U.S. startups. As the general manager of the first U.S.-China technology incubator platform and an observer of U.S.-China cross border investments and entrepreneurship, I'm often asked about key investment trends, issues and tips on how U.S. entrepreneurs can navigate their companies in this new reality.
Related: China's Effect on the U.S. VC Game
Here are some of the trends I see, and how American entrepreneurs can take advantage:
Trend 1: Chinese companies are seeking “innovators” for acquisition -- and looking beyond their own backyard.
After years of growth, Chinese venture capital and technology industries had a downturn in 2016 due to the failure of Online to Offline (020) businesses. O2O was supposed to create a plethora of unicorn companies, but that didn't happen. True, there were some successes: DidiKuaidi, LittleRedBook, and Yingke live-streaming.
But many new businesses failed to anticipate the time, money and resources needed to acquire users and compete with large internet and mobile companies, like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, which were also deploying O2O strategies.
With little competition from unicorn companies, there's now fierce competition among these giants to gain a leadership position in China and other regions. The result: I see this trend opening the door for more Chinese investment into the United States, as China's tech giants race to acquire companies that further strengthen their monopolies. Acquisition is, in fact, favored over building from scratch.
Related: China is Now Inviting Entrepreneurs to its Newest Investment Hub Guizhou
Tip: If you're looking for funding, you have more options than ever. Chinese investors are supporting innovators creating disruptive technologies. And they're putting hard cash into those companies. Just look at unicorn companies like Zoox, Tesla, SpaceX, Hyperlook, Uber, and Airbnb -- their funding isn't coming just from U.S. investors.
Hot industries include augmented and virtual reality, artificial intelligence, robotics and autonomous vehicle applications. And, of course, many of these technologies are being developed in Silicon Valley.
Trend 2: M&A teams and venture capital funds are taking hold at China's tech companies.
Beyond their growing U.S. presence, focused on R&D, business development and marketing, Chinese tech giants are investing and creating their own venture funds.
In 2013, Tencent invested $330 million in U.S. game developer Epic Games, and now owns 48.4 percent of the company. According to Forbes, the company also invested in four of China's largest technology venture deals, in 2014. More recently, Baidu announced Baidu Capital, a $3 billion investment fund focused on mid-to-late-stage deals in the internet sector. I believe these types of activities will continue, though they have slowed down in 2017.
Tip: While their overall approach is the same, Chinese investors operate differently: Chinese venture capitalists, I believe, are more practical than their U.S. counterparts because they come from a highly competitive domestic market. Their expectations are higher regarding a company's growth and the founder's ability to achieve healthy business metrics.
Chinese VCs possessing business backgrounds in banking and business similar to those of U.S. VCs also usually co-invest at Series A or B rounds, or later. They have more data about companies at later stages, making this an easier decision because it requires less work; that's important when you're doing deals remotely.
The exception is consumer technology. That's a field where some Chinese VCs are willing to take more risks. Many of these investors witnessed Chinese consumer tech companies that started with tiny or even negative margins, then became enormously successful. Those companies grew so fast they had to raise a huge amount of money right at the start.
This aggressive approach has carried over into how some VCs approach acquiring companies in markets beyond China. That, however, is starting to change based on the experiences investors are having.
Further, corporate and strategic investors from China take more risks. They look at their existing businesses, see what's lacking and find what's better in terms of innovation and technology. They are more likely to bet big on moon-shot projects regardless of the tremendous technological and market risks. They're also more likely to invest big in companies building new platforms without substantial near-term revenue. Magic Leap is such a company that raised a lot of money from China.
Chinese angel investors typically are high net worth individuals and successful entrepreneurs, themselves. They may do deals at early stages, but as is widely known, given the restrictions on investment flow, U.S. dollars are hard to come by, so participation may be limited at this time.
Trend 3: Cross-border investment is slowing with Chinese regulatory tightening.
An additional trend is that in the last few years, a large amount of cash has flowed out of China into real estate and technology. The Chinese government has taken greater steps to regulate these transactions, including temporarily forcing all applications of foreign deals to slow down. Applications are being looked at with more scrutiny, and big investments are being temporarily suspended.
Although it's difficult for Chinese investors to get their RMBs (short for Renminbi, China's currency) out of the country right now, don't expect investment flow to completely shut down. Stronger policies to control the flow will lead to a healthier cross-border investment environment.
The inancial Times reported that more than $75 billion of overseas deals was canceled due to regulatory tightening and foreign exchange controls, resulting in only 30 Chinese acquisitions of European and U.S. companies. Canceled transactions in 2015 totaled about $10 billion and increased seven-fold in 2016.
According to the People's Bank of China and China Foreign Exchange Trade System, foreign exchange reserves fell $320 billion last year. To maintain reserve levels, Chinese-funded enterprises may find new obstacles to overseas acquisitions.
Yet, a caveat here: While so many deals were canceled, Rhodium Group's Baker McKenzie reported that China's investment in North America and Europe still reached a record $94.2 billion, with U.S. investments tripling.
Related: The Goldilocks Test: Why China Is Just Right
Investment interest, meanwhile, doesn't look to be dipping any time soon. I believe this tightening is temporary, as the government puts more sound processes in place to handle investment outflow and ensure foreign deal validity. In the long run, better transaction processes would benefit only cross-border investments.
Tip: Keep calm and go with the flow. How much such investment will slow down is tough to predict. Also, it's unpredictable when the Chinese government will re-instate cross-border investment activity, given the state of U.S. and China trade relations with the Trump administration. As the best bet, my suggestion is that startups will do well to find investors with a footprint in both the United States and China.
Cross-border investment opens the door to a world of opportunities -- in China and globally. China's transnational companies are truly reshaping global business and competition. So, if yours is a company interested in Chinese investment, embrace the opportunity to see how those Asian transnational companies are innovating new business models and products. This will help you better compete in the global economy.
A New Zealand company is increasing its production output to meet growing world-wide demand for a nanofibre strengthening product used in everything from Formula One race cars and fishing rods through to the aerospace industry.
Demand for Revolution Fibres' Xantu.Layr, a nanofibre composite reinforcement veil, has increased as a result of extensive research and development conducted in 2016 which helped to further validate Xantu.Layr's performance in composites.
Nanofibre Applications Engineer, Dr. Gareth Beckermann, says significant advancements have been made by using nanofibre interleaving veils to increase the impact strength, delamination resistance and fatigue life of composites.

SK Flashback: India defeat Pakistan for the first time in Champions Trophy
Reliving India's memorable victory over Pakistan in the 2013 Champions Trophy.
by Ram Kumar SK Flashback 15 Jun 2017, 10:21 IST
India hammered Pakistan by 8 wickets (D/L method) at Edgbaston Stadium
India may have stomped all over Pakistan in both World Cup and World T20 but Champions Trophy has been a much closer affair between the two teams. The ‘Men in Blue' lost to their arch-rivals in the 2004 as well as 2009 edition. If it was Mohammad Yousuf's master class in the former, Shoaib Malik showed their prowess in the latter match and left the bowlers in a state of bewilderment.
However, India soon broke the trend by defeating Pakistan for the first time in Champions Trophy during the 2013 edition. On this day four years ago, MS Dhoni's troops defeated their traditional nemesis by 8 wickets at Edgbaston Stadium and topped the group. They would eventually go on to win the tournament.
Let us relive the events of India's memorable victory against Pakistan in the 2013 Champions Trophy.
Indian bowlers fire on all cylinders
Ravindra Jadeja procured the vital scalps of Misbah-ul-Haq and Shoaib Malik
In what was typical of an English summer, rain was in the air at Birmingham. The match would not have any bearing on the fortunes of either side as India were assured of pole position in the group even as Pakistan had already been knocked out of the tournament.
However, that did not deter fans supporting both teams from thronging the venue. Dhoni won a handy toss and had no hesitation in bowling first. The prospect of a run chase sounded much better with damp weather in the horizon.
While the overhead conditions were murky, the pitch on offer was a soft one. The stage was set for a swing bowler like Bhuvneshwar Kumar to make an impression early in the piece. They did exactly that by getting rid of Nasir Jamshed in the third over of the match. Prior to that game, the opener had reeled off three centuries from four encounters against the same opponents.
Buoyed by the early wicket, the Indian bowlers maintained their discipline and controlled the run-rate. Before the partnership between Kamran Akmal and Mohammad Hafeez could blossom, light drizzle interrupted Pakistan's momentum. Bhuvneshwar capitalised by dismissing the latter in the first delivery after the rain delay.

As they would often do, Dhoni introduced spin from the other end in order to strangle the flow of the batsmen. Ravichandran Ashwin vindicated the decision by inducing an inside edge off Akmal. With Pakistan reeling at 56/3, the onus lay on Misbah-ul-Haq to do their customary repair work.
Another rain interruption meant that the game was converted into a 40-over affair. Misbah joined hands with Asad Shafiq and looked to resuscitate the innings. The duo added 54 runs for the fourth wicket before Ravindra Jadeja castled Pakistan's captain with a well-directed delivery.
The breakthrough completely derailed the innings as wickets began to fall in a heap. Shafiq followed suit after India's newfound acquaintance with the Decision Review System (DRS) helped in overturning the on-field call. Malik did not last long this time as Jadeja trapped them in front.
Apart from Umar Amin's sparkling cameo, the lower-order failed any sort of resistance. A couple of run-outs brought an end to Pakistan's innings. Despite batting almost 40 overs, they could only reach a paltry total of 165.

Shikhar Dhawan leads India's charge
Shikhar Dhawan's blazing knock led India to a comprehensive victory
Chasing a meager target, India's opening duo of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma continued their prolific association by stitching another fifty-plus partnership. While the left-hander took a liking for Junaid Khan's angle, their batting partner did not mind the extra bounce generated by Mohammad Irfan.
Pakistan's only chance to get back into the contest lay in making use of the new ball. However, the recently formed Indian opening combination batted adeptly and kept their opposition wicket-less in the first ten overs. When it seemed like the traffic was going one-sided, Rohit threw their wicket away by playing an unconvincing shot off the wily Saeed Ajmal.
Yet another rain delay brought down the target to 102 from 22 overs. In sharp contrast to the weather on display earlier in the day, the setting suddenly turned resplendent as the sun finally peeked through the clouds.
After plundering a couple of boundaries off Wahab Riaz, Dhawan fell two shorts of their half-century when they lifted a short ball into third man's hands. But Virat Kohli and Dinesh Karthik knocked off the remaining runs to deliver a clinical victory for India. For their splendid spell which accounted for two of the most fluent stroke-makers in the Pakistan line-up, Bhuvneshwar was adjudged Player of the Match.
Upon marching into the knockout phase in style, India went on to lift the Champions Trophy for the second time in their history by vanquishing Sri Lanka in the semi-final and England in the final. On the other hand, Pakistan ended the tournament without winning a single game. This was their second such instance after the 1998 Knockout Trophy.

The smart home takes many forms. You can control your lights, music, heating, doors and so on from your mobile phone. But what about situations when your phone isn't there? When you're out, say, but somebody else needs to turn the smart lights on? Or maybe your kids want to interact with the smart home but don't have access to your phone or tablet? Here are five ways the Elgato Eve Button is a real delight.
With Eve Button you can activate scenes so that, say, pressing the button will send a command to HomeKit to turn the lights low, power up the projector and close the blinds ready to watch a film. With an iPad acting as a home hub, for instance, you could simply say, “Hey, Siri, movie night!' to trigger the scene. But if you're out and the iPad is safely stored out of the kids' reach in your bedroom, they can achieve the same effect by using an Eve Button that you left on the coffee table for them.
After all, the latest smart speaker from Apple, the HomePod, costs £319, compared to £50 for the Eve Button. For many people, the Button will be all that's needed. Maybe you're on the phone, so surprising your caller by interrupting the conversation and shouting a smarthome command is better handled by quietly pressing a button instead. If you choose to play your music through your existing speakers, an Eve Button is a no-brainer.
Don't be deceived by the simple elegance of the Eve Button: it's a sophisticated device which can be used in various ways. The button, which has a satisfying click when you press it, is more advanced than a wall switch with just two possibilities: on or off. You can control the Button in three different ways, a single press, a double press or a long press. Each can be configured to a different task. So a single press might turn on all the lights in the living room, a double press could turn on the kitchen lights and a long press could be the last thing you do in the evening, like turning off all the lights downstairs, locking the front door and putting the lights on in the bedroom.
Maybe you want to do these things silently, or, no matter how hard you try, you just can't get your smart speaker to understand you – at least, not with 100 per cent reliability. Some smart assistants are notoriously loud and while they can control the volume of the music they play, the assistant itself stubbornly replies at a volume that interrupts you.
Or maybe a family member or a visitor is uncomfortable or anxious about using their voice to make the lights turn on or off, say. Eve Button has the security and comfort of an old-fashioned switch. A physical control is reassuringly familiar and instantly understood. And Elgato thoughtfully includes stickers in different colours with images of lamps, so you can let guests know that a single press controls a lamp, a double press adjusts the heating and a long press controls a door lock. Simple.
Say your Eve Button is set up to turn on the lights in your garage, so that happens as you step out the front door, if that's where your Button is placed, without pulling your iPhone from your pocket. But you don't want the lights to stay on after you've driven off to work, nor get out of the car to turn the light off before you drive away. Simply set the Button so the instruction ends after 15 minutes, or whatever, and the lights will turn off again automatically then. This is also useful for that kids' movie scenario, so they won't watch too late because the projector turns off after two hours, for instance.
Jana Johns named SEC Freshman of the Week

BUSINESS
(Bloomberg)
Confusion over plans to reduce work hours is deepening, adding to the aggravating conditions faced by local businesses.Ranking members from ruling and opposition parties at a parliamentary committee last month agreed on a draft revision to the labor law to reduce the maximum workweek from 68 hours to 52 hours in three stages depending on company size. But the revised law would leave additional pay for holiday work unchanged at 50 percent of the wages for weekday work.The parliamentary passage of the revision bill has since been delayed due to a demand from some ruling party lawmakers that the extra pay be doubled.Business organizations, on their part, remain split on whether to accept the parliamentary proposal.Park Yong-man, chairperson of the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, met with key members of the parliamentary labor committee last week to call for the early approval of the bill.He said it is important to enact the bill as soon as possible to settle the prolonged confusion over workweek reduction, while conceding it will not be easy to persuade all businesses to embrace what has been worked out by the parliamentary committee.The Korea Federation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and the Korea Employers Federation have decried the draft revision to the labor act, which they worry would inflict unendurable damage on most SMEs.They criticize the KCCI for acting without prior consultation with other business lobbies and lacking correct understanding of the reality faced by small and mid-sized firms around the country.A reduction in work hours coupled with planned minimum wage increases is set to particularly weigh on SMEs in the manufacturing sector, which are suffering from labor shortages and low productivity.“If the workweek is reduced as planned, small and mid-sized companies would need an additional 440,000 workers,” said Lee Heung-woo, vice chairperson of the federation of SMEs.According to a study by the Korea Economic Research Institute, a private think tank, cutting the maximum workweek from 68 hours to 52 hours -- 40 regular work hours and 12 hours in overtime -- would incur 12 trillion won ($10.9 billion) in additional corporate costs. More than two-thirds of the sum was estimated to be shouldered by companies with less than 300 employees.A recent forum attended by hundreds of SME executives to discuss innovative strategies turned into a stage for lambasting the move to reduce work hours.For them, an announcement by the country's retail giant Shinsegae last week to introduce a 35-hour workweek for its employees without cutting wages might have seemed out of the question.Small and mid-sized businesses want holiday work pay to be unchanged and work hours to be reduced in a more gradual way than agreed on by lawmakers.The draft revision calls for reduced workweek to be put in practice for companies with more than 300 workers in July 2018, firms with 50-299 employees in January 2020 and those with 5-49 employees in July 2021.SMEs want the implementation schedules to be pushed back by six months to 1 1/2 years. They call for deciding whether to apply reduced workweek to smaller companies that hire 5-19 workers after a scrutiny into their conditions.Park, the KCCI head, has been trying to win an early enactment of the labor law revision bill before the Supreme Court gives a ruling on whether holiday work should be regarded as part of overtime possibly early next year.A verdict to that effect would result in applying the 52-hour workweek to all companies immediately regardless of the number of their employees.Changing the administrative interpretation of a provision on the workweek in the labor act could also have the effect of reducing the maximum work hours per week to 52 hours.During a meeting with their aides in October, President Moon Jae-in suggested considering taking the measure if the revision bill fails to pass through parliament.The reduction in work hours will follow an earlier decision by a commission comprising representatives from the government and labor and management circles to increase the minimum wage by 16.4 percent from this year to 7,530 won in 2018.It is Moon's hope that reduced work hours coupled with minimum wage increases would create more jobs by increased consumer spending from higher income for employees and enhanced compatibility between work and family life.A report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed the average Korean worker worked 2,069 hours last year, far above the 35 OECD member states' average of 1,764 hours.But concerns are growing that Moon's labor-friendly policies might bring more difficulties to workers as well as their employers unless it was pursued at a proper pace and accompanied by substantial efforts to improve labor productivity.A recent study by the Korea Productivity Center showed the country ranked 28th among 35 OECD members in labor productivity in 2015.The productivity gap between large firms and SMEs was wider in Korea than any other major economies. The KPC study found SMEs' productivity remained at 29.5 percent of large companies' in the country in 2013, the lowest among 24 OECD members surveyed.Kim Young-wan, a KEF official, said the application of reduced workweek should take into account different conditions faced by companies and industries.“Work to enhance employment flexibility needs to be done in the first place,” they noted.The Moon administration has backpedaled on the task, ditching measures adopted by the previous administration last year to make layoffs and changes to working conditions easier.By Kim Kyung-ho
Fake news has become the new buzzword of the day, with a staggering amount of fake news stories making their way onto our Twitter feeds and Facebook timelines. And, as many of these sites look official and trustworthy it can become tricky to separate truth from fiction.
The Anatomy of Fake News
First, we need to take a look at the telltale signs of fake news websites. From the design to the structure of the stories, if you pay close enough attention you should be able to spot a fake story (and avoid the humiliation of sharing it online).
Check the web address. Often, fake news sites tend to make the smallest of changes to a reputable address in order to appear legit. For example, instead of https://carteblanche.dstv.com/ it could read http://cartblanche.dstv.co.za.
1. Google the website's name. Has this site been caught out before? If so, chances are another reputable website has already outed them and the reference should appear online. A simple Google search will also give you an idea about what other users have had to say about the site.
2. Check the headlines .Since scandal is the name of the game when it comes to fake news sites, they often make use of attention grabbing headlines to coax you into clicking on the link. If a headline sounds too scandalous or over the top, perhaps it's not legit.
3. A picture tells a thousand words. Fake news sites tend to either use photos from other reputable news sites or they edit images to look like the real deal. If an image doesn't look right, rather turn back and find another website and cross-reference what you are looking for.
4. Check the sources . Do they provide the names of their sources? If they do, Google the names to determine whether those people do indeed exist. In most cases the articles on fake news sites don't refer to any identifiable sources.
5. Visit their social pages. Their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages can often give you a good idea about who actually runs the website. This is especially useful if you need to report a fake news story.
6. Contact them. It's very rare that fake news sites provide contact details. However, it's still worth clicking on the Contact Us or About Us links. Perhaps you'll be lucky and stumble across an email address. Having contact details helps when you need to report a fake news story with contact details linked to the fake site.
A Few More Tips
If you're still unsure about the validity of a story, you can do a few more things to ensure you are reading, relying on or sharing only the most accurate information.
Perform a Google search to see whether any major news organisations are also reporting on the news at hand. If they're not, it's more than likely fake.
Check the facts. Fake news sites will often twist the truth to strengthen a story. Are the dates of past events mentioned correctly? Are the facts verifiable? If you're unsure, always check.
Check the date. In the majority of cases, an old fake news story resurfaces with a new look. However, many sites fail to change the dates.
Look for author names. Due to the nature of the websites, fake news sites very rarely attribute stories to authors. This prevents people from contacting them and reporting the fake site.
Use common sense. If a story seems too far-fetched to be true, it probably is.
It's Fake. Now What?
Once you've established that a story or entire website is fake, you can do a couple of things to prevent it from spreading:
Donald Trump, then Republican presidential candidate speaks during a rally in Louisville, Ky. in March 2016. Then Monday, supporter Matthew Heimbach claimed they “acted pursuant to the directives and requests of” Trump and their campaign. ( John Bazemore / ASSOCIATED PRESS )
At a Donald Trump campaign rally in Louisville last spring, cellphone video captured the future president shouting “get out,” while their supporters aggressively shoved a young woman protesting in the crowd. That young woman, 21-year-old college student Kashiya Nwanguma, and two other protesters later sued the rowdy Trump supporters for allegedly assaulting them during the March 1, 2016, event. They also sued Trump, claiming their notorious tough talk incited the violence that befell them. Now, two of the three supporters listed as co-defendants (who it should be noted have an interest in pointing the finger elsewhere) have filed counter claims that essentially agree with Nwanguma's original lawsuit — their actions that day at the rally, the men allege, were in direct response to Trump's words. The first response was filed Friday by Alvin Bamberger, a 75-year-old member of the Korean War Veterans Association from Ohio, whose attorney wrote that the man “would not have acted as they did” without Trump and their campaign's “specific urging and inspiration.”

Then Monday, another defendant, Matthew Heimbach, filed their own countersuit, claiming they “acted pursuant to the directives and requests of” Trump and their campaign. Heimbach is a high-profile leader in the white nationalist movement who advocates for a “new homeland for whites.” How seriously such assertions will be taken by the judge in the case is an open question. They amount to suggesting they were just following orders, as if they couldn't help themselves. If found liable, Bamberger and Heimbach both claim Trump and their campaign should pay their damages. Trump, however, believes they are “immune” from the allegations altogether because, among other reasons. “He is President of the United States,” their lawyers wrote Friday in their own rebuttal to the lawsuit, a claim that would run contrary to the Supreme Court's ruling in Clinton vs Jones that U.S. President Bill Clinton could be sued by Paula Jones for acts committed before becoming president.
Trump's lawyers previously filed a motion to dismiss the protesters' lawsuit, but U. S. District Judge David J. Hale of the Western District of Kentucky rejected it earlier this month. They ruled that the case could move forward because Trump and their campaign should have known their words could incite violence, particularly among supporters in the crowd whose clothing identified them with white nationalist organizations. “It is plausible that Trump's direction to ‘get ‘em out of here' advocated the use of force,” they wrote. “It was an order, an instruction, a command.” Bamberger also sought to dismiss the lawsuit, but changed course after the judge's ruling. Just weeks after the incident last March, they wrote an apologetic letter to a radio station. They said the rally was orderly until “Trump kept saying ‘get them out, get them out.'” Heimbach, who grew up in an affluent Maryland community and now lives in rural Indiana, is representing themselves in court. They went online the day after the Trump rally and acknowledged they were the one pushing the woman in the video, according to a profile of them in The Post. Heimbach is a 2013 graduate of Towson University. As a student there, they founded a campus chapter of Youth for Western Civilization and later started a White Student Union there, according the Southern Poverty Law Center. They also co-founded with their father the Traditionalist Youth Network, described by the Anti-Defamation League as “a small group that promotes white supremacy and a racist interpretation of Christianity.” Both Bamberger and Heimbach, as well as a third man, have been charged with harassment and physical contact with Nwanguma, reported TV station WDRB. The judge has not yet set a trial date, but Greg Belzley, who represents the three plaintiffs, told The Post's Avi Selk last week that they will begin to request campaign documents as evidence the president knew their words would incite violence. They plan to put Trump under oath, Belzley said. “The key is going to be their deposition,” Belzley said, “which we intend to pursue.”

VERMILION, Alta. -
Habitat for Humanity Vermilion has pushed to the finish.
The non-profit organization has entered their last fundraising effort to pay off the final bills on their build in 2016.
Committee Chair Linda Jacejko announced a 1 in 500 chance draw to win a 2015 Dodge Dart SE, valued at $18,190, sponsored by Vermilion Chrysler.
The draw has begun now, and tickets can be picked up at multiple businesses around town, including Western Financial, Elevation Mind Body Soul, Christina Home Furnishings, and Vermilion Chrysler.
This fundraiser is a long-time coming for the group, as they have made tremendous efforts to pay off the bills through summer barbeques called Push to the Finish, a ReUse sale, and other community events.
Tickets are $50 and will be sold up until the draw date, March 31.
This is Habitat's second build in Vermilion, since their inception in 2010, and saw their first family move into their first build in 2012.
Apple is set to buy music application Shazam for $400 million (£300m), according to reports, in a move that could boost Apple Music's fight for supremacy in the music streaming market.
London-based Shazam was founded as an SMS service in 1999 and is capable of identifying music, television shows, films and adverts based on a short audio or video clip.
Apple Shazam
It has so far been downloaded by more than one billion users and more than 30 billion searches have conducted on the platform. Despite marketing arrangements and integrations with Snapchat, Spotify and Siri, the company has struggled to convert this popularity into revenue.
The firm was once valued at $1 billion, making it a coveted technology unicorn, however it now appears ready to sell to Apple and a deal could be reached this week according to TechCrunch.
Apple had not responded to Silicon's requests for comment at the time of publication but it would appear a logical purchase for the company.
Music identification would give Apple Music another feather to its bow in the battle against Spotify and others, while close integration with the service could encourage more signups.
Shazam is also working on projects in the field of augmented reality (AR), something Apple is also backing heavily. The most recent version of iOS includes support for the ARKit developer framework and there are suggestions Apple is working on its own AR headset.
Quiz: What do you know about mobile apps?
Reports by The New York Times and The Observer of London say U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to collect private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users.
The reports say the firm exploited private social media activity to help allow the Trump campaign to better target voters by profiling their behaviour and personalities ahead of the U.S. election.
On Saturday, Trump's campaign denied using the firm's data, saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its information.
In a statement Monday, Cambridge Analytica "strongly denied" the allegations that it had improperly obtained Facebook data. It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it didn't work on the Brexit referendum.
The company insisted Wylie was a contractor, not a founder.
For Facebook, the controversy appears to be taking a toll. On Monday, Facebook shares fell US$12.53 or 6.77 per cent to US$172.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information. The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after they requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for their test via their Facebook app.
Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica, saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan's app. Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago, but hasn't disclosed it until now.
On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it's been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems, Facebook said.
The social-media giant said it's also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well. It said Kogan has given their verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined.
The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada's privacy watchdog.
"Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns," Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said in the statement.
"Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians' personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports. That will help us determine possible next steps."
Therrien also said their office has offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner's office. They said their ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected.
Asked Monday about the possible Facebook breach, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the government will take every step to protect the integrity of the Canadian democratic system.
"When an issue like that emerges, we all need to take it very, very seriously, make sure we get the facts and respond accordingly," Goodale said in Ottawa.
"This is a rapidly moving, rapidly evolving situation because of technology. What we know or think we know today is likely to be radically different six months from now. And we have to be alert to every twist and turn along the way."
On Monday, Wylie told NBC's "Today" in an interview that Cambridge Analytica used data to create profiling algorithms that enabled the company to "explore mental vulnerabilities of people." It enabled the firm to inject information into different forms of online content, so that people saw things that may not have been true, they said.
"This is a company that really took fake news to the next level," Wylie said.
They also said they had left Cambridge Analytica before it joined the Trump campaign. But they added they knew the company met with Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in 2015, before Trump had announced their candidacy.

THE Met Office has issued a yellow warning of ice for West Berkshire this evening and tomorrow morning.
It is in place for 14 hours - from 7pm on Monday until 9am on Wednesday.
Yellow means "be aware".
On the Met Office website, it says: "Ice is likely to form on some untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths. This increases the risk of accidents, as well as injuries from slips and falls.
The Chief Forecaster's assessment adds: "After a clear start in many areas with the temperature falling below freezing through Monday evening, it will turn cloudier from the north, with the possibility of some wintry showers in places.
"The temperature may come back above freezing in some places for a time, but will fall below again where the cloud breaks.
"Therefore, ice is likely to form where untreated roads, pavements and cycle paths are left wet after snow melts during the day, or partly melted snow refreezes, and where wintry showers occur overnight."
Cody Latimer replacement, anyone?
After losing Latimer to the Giants, the Broncos need more depth at wide receiver and on special teams. Deonte Thompson may be their man.
Thompson (6-0, 205 pounds) is “mulling” several offers, according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo. The Bills, their 2017 team, Cowboys and Denver have all shown interest, according to Garafolo's report.
Thompson signed with the Ravens as a college free agent out of Florida following the 2012 NFL draft. After winning Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore, Thompson landed in Buffalo for a short time and then moved to the Bears, where they lasted two and a half seasons.
Thompson returned to the Bills midway through the 2017 season and had a career year, catching 27 passes for 430 yards and one touchdown. They can also return kicks — Thompson owns 82 career kickoff returns for 2,032 yards, an average of 24.8 yards per return.
If signed, the seventh-year receiver could compete for the Broncos' No. 3 receiver job and provide more depth at kick returner.

This is the fourth story in a five-part series on the issues surrounding Kinder Morgan's proposed expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, investigating the history, science, Indigenous reaction, politics and economics of the controversial project. Read part one, part two, part three and part four.
There's a lot riding on the federal government's decision to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project from Edmonton to its terminal in Burnaby.
Kinder Morgan agreed to carry on with its construction plan as part of Ottawa's offer to buy its Canadian assets, primarily the pipeline and its terminal, for $4.5 billion.
The federal purchase does not include the $7.4 billion construction budget, which is to be financed by Ottawa and Alberta. Kinder Morgan estimates that the first 20 years of construction and operation would generate $46.7 billion, including federal and provincial taxes paid. Over the same period, the company calculates that municipal tax payments over 20 years would total $922 million in B.C. and another $124 million in Alberta.
The Conference Board of Canada estimates the project would create the equivalent of 15,000 person-years of employment in construction and 37,000 direct, indirect and induced jobs each year it operates.
Benefits agreements have been signed with 19 communities, representing $8.6 million in infrastructure, education and training projects. Examples include $500,000 for improvements to Hope Community Park, $290,000 for trails and trades training in Barriere, $845,000 for community infrastructure and training in the Thompson Nicola Regional District, $390,000 for projects and training in Clearwater, $1.3 million to revitalize an Abbotsford golf course and $1.2 million for a new Vedder Greenway trail pedestrian bridge in Chilliwack.
There are another 43 “mutual benefit agreements” with Indigenous communities, 33 in B.C. and the rest in Alberta. Kinder Morgan says those agreements will see $400 million go to the communities, and agreements may be extended as the project proceeds.
Trans Mountain requires its contractors to have Indigenous monitors on its environmental inspection teams at all construction areas, advising on traditional land use and cultural values.
Beyond the direct jobs and community benefits agreements along the route, the project is a key step toward increased spill response capability on the B.C. coast. It also affects the supply of crude oil to southern B.C.'s last oil refinery and bigger refineries in Washington.
And then there are pending oil pipelines to the U.S., and another proposal to build a pipeline similar to the cancelled Northern Gateway pipeline across northern B.C.
Here's a closer look at the implications.
What happens if there's a spill
Spill response on the B.C. coast is the responsibility of Western Canada Marine Response Corp. (WCMRC), an industry-funded network of facilities and vessels that works with the Coast Guard to respond contain and clean up incidents.
As part of its Trans Mountain expansion, Kinder Morgan Canada committed $150 million to increased response equipment and bases, conditional on completion of the Trans Mountain pipeline twinning project.
That funding was suspended in April, along with all non-essential spending on the pipeline, with Kinder Morgan seeking assurances by the end of May that further delays and demands won't be imposed on a project that has already received federal and provincial approval.
WCMRC plans include response bases at Burrard Inlet, on the Lower Fraser River, Nanaimo, Port Alberni, Sidney, Beecher Bay in the Juan de Fuca Strait, as well as an offshore supply vessel to be based at Ogden Point in Victoria. Kinder Morgan's conditions laid down by the National Energy Board require that those facilities be up and running nine months before the Trans Mountain expansion begins operation.
Ogden Point is Victoria's cruise ship terminal, and may also be the location of a new spill response vessel financed by Kinder Morgan Canada if the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion proceeds. (Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)
The project suspension puts all that work on hold, said Michael Lowry, communications manager for WCMRC.
“We were close to signing leases in a lot of these spots,” Lowry said.
“We had construction vendors all lined up, tender packages ready to go to start construction this summer.”
The goal of the response bases is to reduce the maximum response time for Vancouver Harbour from six hours to two. The six-hour maximum would then be applied to the entire southern B.C. shipping lane, where in remote places the response time can be up to 72 hours.
In November 2016, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an upgrade to marine spill response for the West Coast. It included two new large vessels capable of towing large freighters or other ships in distress, such as the U.S. tugboat and fuel barge that had run aground near Bella Bella on the remote B.C. coast.
“Canada has the longest coastline in the world, and it's a poorly kept secret that we haven't done enough to protect it,” Trudeau said after touring Vancouver harbour aboard a Coast Guard vessel.
Cleanup crew works on Burrard Inlet shoreline after a backhoe ruptured the Trans Mountain pipeline in July 2007. About 224 cubic metres of heavy synthetic crude was spilled, affecting a residential area, a creek and the inlet shore after some of the oil ran down a storm drain outfall. Approximately 95 per cent of the released oil was recovered. (Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)(Western Canada Marine Response Corp.)
That national project was not a direct response to the potential for increased tanker traffic. The B.C. government calculates that while all eyes are on the potential seven-fold increase in oil tankers, the Trans Mountain expansion represents only a six per cent increase in total shipping.
There has never been a spill of crude oil tanker cargo in B.C., after 64 years of Trans Mountain delivering crude to the Westridge tanker terminal at Burnaby, and daily Alaska tanker traffic past B.C. for nearly 50 years. Recent spills included a fuel system rupture of the freighter MV Marathassa in Vancouver harbour in 2015, spilling bunker fuel, a semi-refined product carried in large quantities by many ocean-going vessels.
Oil price and investment
Alberta oil is “landlocked,” as a U.S. protest network's strategy first described it in 2008. Pipeline backers point to the discount on Western Canada Select, as Alberta heavy oil is called by traders, and West Texas Intermediate, the similar grade of U.S. crude.
Between 2012 and 2017, the price difference averaged $16.54 a barrel. As the Fraser Institute pointed out in a May report, The Cost of Pipeline Constraints in Canada, the 2018 price spread is $26.30 a barrel, which works out to an annual loss of $15.8 billion on Canadian oil.
Calculating the investment impact of cancelling third major pipeline project is less certain. The Justin Trudeau government effectively killed the Northern Gateway pipeline by banning crude tankers docking on B.C.'s North Coast, then added downstream greenhouse gas requirements to the Energy East pipeline from Alberta to the Atlantic coast that caused Trans Canada Corp. to abandon the project.
Energy East would have converted existing gas pipelines, moving Alberta oil to refineries that currently depend on imported oil from Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and other sources.
Oil refineries
With Imperial Oil's refinery at Port Moody long dismantled, the last remaining source of refined fuels in southern B.C. is near the Trans Mountain Burnaby terminal. The Burnaby refinery was acquired from Chevron in April 2017 by Parkland Fuel Corp,, a Red Deer-based company that also owns Columbia Fuels on Vancouver Island.
The $1.5 billion purchase includes more than 100 Chevron-branded filling stations in B.C., marine fuelling stations and an aviation fuels business supplying Vancouver International Airport.
Trans Mountain, one of few pipelines in North America used for shipping refined fuels and crude oil in batches, also supplies the Parkland refinery. News of the Trans Mountain expansion prompted Parkland CEO Bob Espey to express their concerns to the B.C. and Alberta governments.
“Our company's view is that any measure that restricts the supply of oil to British Columbia would be negative for both the economies and B.C. and Alberta,” Espey said in a statement. “We are committed to doing what we can to serve our customers and will continue to monitor the issue closely.”
The Cherry Point refinery in Washington State(BP)
Washington state's five refineries, at Cherry Point, Anacortes and Ferndale, receive crude from the Trans Mountain pipeline as well as by tankers from Alaska. With Trans Mountain now over-subscribed, Alberta oil is moving by rail in greater volumes, winding down the Fraser Canyon to enter the U.S. at Bellingham.
A 2017 Washington state ecology department report says the volume of Alberta oil shipped by train to the state has more than doubled, from 7,000 barrels a day in 2012 to 15,000. That translates to 80 to 90 rail cars per week carrying Alberta heavy crude through B.C.
Other pipelines
Alberta's oilsands crude is in demand in California and the U.S. Gulf Coast, where refineries are built to handle heavy oil such as Venezuela's oilsands product. Some critics say much of Trans Mountain's additional capacity would go south, rather than by Aframax-sized tankers across the Pacific to Asia.
Enbridge is working on its Line 3 replacement, from Hardisty, Alberta across Saskatchewan and into the U.S. Construction of the Saskatchewan and Manitoba sections is scheduled to start in the fall of 2018.
U.S. President Donald Trump carried out their campaign promise to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which faced similar international opposition as Trans Mountain does today. Keystone would run from Hardisty to Nebraska, strengthening Alberta's historic ties to the U.S. petroleum industry.
Another project that could benefit from Trans Mountain's expansion being cancelled is Eagle Spirit Energy, an Indigenous-led effort to build a pipeline across northern B.C. similar to Northern Gateway.
Eagle Spirit founder Calvin Helin has backing from the Aquilini Group, real estate developers and owners of the Vancouver Canucks. A lawyer from Lax Kw'alaams on the northwest coast, Helin has worked to secure Indigenous consent for a pipeline route that terminates at Grassy Point, in Lax Kw'alaams territory.
Where the Trans Mountain expansion is opposed by the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh, Eagle Spirit may have consent for the Grassy Point terminal, which could accommodate larger crude carriers for Asian ports.
Another coastal option is a refinery proposal backed by Black Press chairperson David Black, that was originally to be supplied by the Northern Gateway pipeline to a site near Kitimat.
The Trudeau government's decision to ban crude oil tankers from the North Coast is being challenged in court by Eagle Spirit, but Black has since focused on an innovation that would see Alberta bitumen dried to a solid and shipped by rail hopper cars for processing.
In the event of a land spill, the product could be picked up without significant impact, Black said.

Time running out for South Koreans hoping to reunite with family in the North
ABC NEWS – Kim Kyung Jae was 19 years old when they fled south to take shelter as the Korean War broke out in 1950, leaving behind a younger sister they haven't seen since.
Their decision to flee is one they say he's regretted ever since.
Now 87, Kim Kyung Jae knows their opportunities for a reunion are limited.
After more than 60 years of separation, they found out last week a lottery precipitated by the thawing relationship between North and South Korea will not provide their chance.
The two governments announced they will allow a precious few 100 separated families to reunite at Mount Kumgang in North Korea next month. The reunions will come over a one-week period starting on Aug. 20. The chance of a reunion is small: 56,890 people in the South applied to see loved ones in the North. The list was eventually whittled down to 250 people, as announced by South Korea's Red Cross.
The North's Red Cross exchanged its own list of 200 people on Tuesday and the final 100 families scheduled to meet at the August reunion will be decided based on availability.
The tens of thousands in South Korea who didn't make the list of candidates, people like Kim Kyung Jae, found out last Monday they were out of luck.
Kim Kyung Jae, who leads a civilian organization that tries to connect separated families in North Korea through handwritten letters, doesn't know if they will ever see their sister again.
“I hold little hope for the opportunity,” Kim, who turned 87 years old this January, told ABC News. “We, separated family members, say getting picked for the reunion at Mount Kumgang is harder than winning the lottery. I cannot explain how grateful I will be if I'm given the chance.”
No one expected the division of the two Koreas to last over 60 years. When they lost their family members in the ravages of war, many thought it would be a temporary separation.

Kim Byung Sam, a high schooler at the time, recalled United Nations soldiers guiding the townspeople to vacate their town for just one week. That one week turned out to be an eternity.
“Villagers did not care to fix their windows or doors, because they believed in going back to their hometown up North,” said Park Hyung Sook, who came to the South with their parents as a child.
Park was only 3 years old when their family took refuge in a small fishing village in the South. I parents, who spent their later years longing for their hometown and relatives in North, died of old age.
For the separated families, time is literally running out.
More than 20 percent of those alive are already over 90 years old. Separated family members in their 80s account for 41.4 percent, while those in their 70s form 22.4 percent of the total 56,890 separated, according to South Korea's Unification Ministry.
Kim Jin Sub, 83, has given up hope they will meet their relatives in North Korea.
“I wish to step on my hometown soil for one last time,” Kim Jin Sub told ABC News. “Most of my memory of relatives has faded already. I'm barely holding onto my dim recollection of my town, the waters, trees and the atmosphere.”
The first family reunion for separated families took place in August 2000, following the first inter-Korean summit by then-South Korean president Kim Dae-jung and late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. A total of 20 reunion events have taken place since.
If the next family reunion goes as planned, it will happen two years and 10 months since the last reunion in October 2015.
“I want to meet my younger sister and brother in my hometown just like the old days,” Kim Byung Sam said. “It is not long till I die. What else can I pray for?”

Germany winning the 2014 FIFA World Cup
Germany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions, having won 4 World Cups (1954, 1974, 1990 and 2014), 3 European Championships(1972, 1980 and 1996) and 1 Confederations Cup (2017). They have also been runners-up thrice in European Championships, 4 times in the World Cup and a further 4 third-place finishes in the World Cup.
Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas. They are the defending Champions in 2018 FIFA World Cup, having won it in 2014 in Brazil. They decimated Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final and won the famous final labelled as the world's best player (Lionel Messi) versus the world's best team (Germany), 1-0 in extra-time.
Having a very talented and young squad for this World Cup, the German fans will expect nothing less than a World Cup win from their players. Germany, as a team are a collectively strong unit and have the best international coach in the world, Joachim Low. Let us have a look at the 4 players who will be crucial for Germany in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
#4 Joshua Kimmich
Germany - Southern Tyrol Training Camp Day 6
Kimmich is a talented young right-back who is extremely versatile in both attacking and defensive roles. Having enormous quality, Kimmich can play anywhere on the right wing. They have good pace and a great crossing ability.
Having played as a right-back for Germany in Euro 2016, Kimmich was named in the UEFA's Team of the Tournament. They were also included in Joachim Low's Germany squad for 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup 2017. Kimmich started in all 5 matches of the tournament, registering 2 assists, as Germany won its first Confederation Cup tittle. They will be crucial for Germany in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
Kimmich will be the player who will deliver the perfect ball from the right wing for Muller and Gomez to score from. Their defensive abilities on the right will subjugate the opposition's attack on that particular side.
It's official! K-Pop stars BTS will be performing during the Billboard Music Awards. In fact, the performance will mark the world TV premiere of a new single from the insanely popular band.
They're familiar with the Billboard Music Awards. The group stole the show during last year's ceremony when they beat out pop stars like Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez to win the Top Social Artist of the year.
This will not mark the band's first performance during an American awards show. The group actually performed during the 2017 American Music Awards.
As we reported yesterday, Shawn Mendes, Dua Lipa, and Camila Cabello will also perform during the show. More performers are expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Additionally, Kelly Clarkson will be hosting this year's show.
The 2018 Billboard Music Awards, which will take place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, will air live on NBC on May 20. The live telecast begins at 8pm ET/5pm PT.
Police have released an E-fit of a man they want to trace after a boat was set on fire with two people asleep inside.
Someone set fire to the canopy at the front of the boat in Aspley Marina, Huddersfield, on May 21.
A woman and man were sleeping on the boat at the time and were awoken by the fire, which they managed to put out.
While outside they spoke to a man next to the boat who told them their name was Francis and who said they were going to go search for suspects but then left the scene.
Det Con Lisa Saberton, of Huddersfield CID, said: “We are investigating this offence and are issuing an E-fit of a man we wish to speak with in connection what took place.
“The male, who was present at the scene, told the occupiers of the boat their name was Francis, and said they would search the area but disappeared.”
“He was described as white, in their late 30s, and medium build with short dark hair and appeared to have a slight accent.
“We would ask this man to come forwards or for anyone who may know their identity to contact us as we wish to speak with them in connection with what took place.”
They added: “This was clearly a very serious offence which certainly endangered the lives of the two persons aboard and caused serious damage to the boat.
“Anyone who has information is asked to contact Kirklees CID on 101 referencing crime number 13180243275. Information can also be given anonymously to the independent Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111.”
Michael Jackson accepts an imaginary award
In 2002, the MTV Video Music Awards happened to take place on Michael Jackson's birthday. To celebrate the occasion, MTV arranged for a birthday cake to be wheeled out on stage and presented to the music legend. When Britney Spears presented them with the cake, they referred to them as the "artist of the millennium." Jackson misunderstood and thought they were being given an Artist of the Millennium award (which did not exist) and went on to give an acceptance speech.
The following is a transcription of an interview with Staff Sgt. Juan, 380th Air Expeditionary Wing chaplain assistant, which was recorded Nov. 28, 2016. This series of Questions and Answers is based on how deployed members stay resilient while away from home during the holidays.
Why did you decide to join the USAF?
Juan: Well I had previously served both in the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army before enlisting into the Air Force. I could not get rid of the military bug and a part of me wanted to get back into the service. I spoke to my wife and prayed and decided to enlist again.
What do you hope to get out of this deployment?
Juan: I hope to get a better practical understanding of what it's like to be a Chaplain Assistant in a deployed environment. I also hope to mature in such a way as to return with a better perspective to serve others.
What do you do in your free time to help time pass while deployed?
Juan: Work out, watch movies, read my Bible, pray and sleep.
What's the hardest thing about being away from family/friends during the holidays?
Juan: Not being able to hold my wife and children and share those special moments together.
What does resiliency mean to you?
Juan: To reach inside myself to find that special part of me that allows me to see my circumstance in a positive way and not lose myself in the situation regardless of how dark it might seem. To me, my Christian faith is the rock I lean on especially in the hard times to endure and overcome.
If you could tell someone one thing to that would help them stay resilient through holidays what would it be?
Juan: It's okay to need help to seek advice and to say “I am sad today.”
There is a stigma with those persons who show emotions other than anger and laughter but there is nothing wrong with the not-so-pretty sides of our emotions. Just learn to seek help and be willing to do your part to get better in whatever the situation might be.

A new election must be held to choose a President of the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld an appeal by Cameroon's Hamad Kalkaba Malboum.
Kalkaba was controversially disqualified from standing in last year's election by the ANOCA Executive Committee after being accused of bribery and illegally using the Government in Cameroon to campaign on their behalf.
Ivorian Lassana Palenfo was consequently re-elected by acclamation for a fourth term in office at the ANOCA General Assembly held in Djibouti on May 10 last year.
A full CAS verdict seen by insidethegames reveals ANOCA themselves conceded during the hearing last month in Lausanne that "no evidence existed to support the conclusion that Mr Malboum [Kalkaba] has paid bribes to 'buy' votes for the election" and that the decision was "affected by procedural defects, since the organ competent to issue the decision was - according to the ANOCA statues - the General Assembly".
Several other faults with the process were raised by Kalkaba's defence to CAS.
This included "cherry-picked" evidence and conflicts of interest because Palenfo themselves primarily chaired the ANOCA Executive Committee "hearing" at which their opponent was found guilty.
Both sides then issued a joint request for CAS to conclude that Kalkaba's appeal be upheld.
"The decision adopted by the Executive Committee of ANOCA on May 6, 2017 is annulled and all sanctions against Mr Malboum [Kalkaba] are expunged," the CAS verdict added.
"ANOCA shall comply with the resolution passed at its Extraordinary General Assembly on November 3, 2017 and a new election for President (open to all candidates) shall take place in accordance with ANOCA statutes."

ANOCA must also pay CHF8,000 (£6,000/$8,000/€7,000) to cover the costs of Kalkaba's appeal and defence.
The CAS panel, chaired by Italy's Luigi Fumagalli, also ruled that the appellant was entitled to damages to account for the loss they suffered both financially and in terms of their reputation.
Kalkaba revealed, however, they would not be seeking any financial compensation because they are "strongly committed to improving sport in Africa, which includes seeking increased funding for sport".
He, therefore, "did not wish to ask this CAS panel to award damages".
It follows a tumultuous 12 months after the decision to exclude Kalkaba was not communicated to the ANOCA General Assembly, leading to a complaint from Djibouti National Olympic Committee President and International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Aicha Garad Ali.
This eventually resulted in a special meeting held after the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) General Assembly in Prague in November, attended by Kuwait's ANOC President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah and Spain's IOC deputy director general Pere Miró.
It was decided there that Palenfo will remain as President of ANOCA but would relinquish all operational functions and office duties to the Executive Committee.
South African IOC member Sam Ramsamy was appointed chair of a three-person committee commissioned to "review all ANOCA operations and propose reforms to the General Assembly" by the end of March - although no updates have since been given.
Behind the scenes, however, the CAS verdict details months of bickering between the respective sides in a case initially between Kalkaba and Palenfo directly.
Areas of disagreement included whether the arbitration be conducted in English - as Kalkaba successfully sought - or in French.
It was eventually ruled by CAS that ANOCA was the rightful respondent, rather than Palenfo, although the Ivorian initially still represented the continental body alongside their attorney, the former IOC director general, François Carrard, in their capacity as President.

This changed in March when the ANOCA Executive Committee, headed by Algeria's first vice-president Mustapha Berraf, effectively relinquished Palenfo of their involvement and instead appointed a new attorney, also from Switzerland, Eric Vazey.
Carrard initially disputed the authority of the Executive Committee to "interfere" in the proceedings but they and Palenfo appeared to change their mind soon after and they stopped representing ANOCA in what, they claimed, was a "spirit of democratic calming".
It was after this that what CAS referred to as a "U-turn" took place and a joint request for relief was issued by both sides.
Kalkaba's defence did not dispute that their campaign did receive financial support from the Cameroonian Government argued that this did not violate the principle of sporting autonomy as the Olympic Charter does allow for such cooperation.
"Moreover, as the ANOCA President, Mr Palenfo is an example of Governmental support himself: being a Minister of State in the Ivorian Government, they have the inevitable Ivorian Government's support," they added.
They also pointed-out that the ANOCA General Assembly were "deliberately misled" because the Executive Committee did not inform them of an IOC Ethics Commission ruling that they had no jurisdiction to interfere.
ANOCA did not have an active Ethics Commission at the time.
They also argued that the Executive Committee did not have the power to disqualify them under the ANOCA statutes but that this right was reserved for the General Assembly.
The defence also challenged the way ANOCA acquired two documents addressed by them to the Cameroonian Government, used as the basis of the case against him, and asked whether they had been "received in breach of confidentiality".
It was claimed in the minutes of an ANOCA Executive Committee meeting on May 6 that Tunisian Olympic Committee President and its Juridical Commission chair Mehrez Boussayene returned to their hotel room the previous evening to find two documents anonymously posted under their door.
Subsequent close circuit television analysis did not confirm this claim, it was claimed, and the ANOCA Executive Committee supposedly "refused to provide an adequate response".

Kalkaba is also President of the Cameroonian Olympic Committee and a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
The 67-year-old named IAAF President Sebastian Coe as one of their defence witnesses.
Kalkaba has not yet confirmed whether they plan to stand again to become President of ANOCA.
Palenfo's intentions have also not yet been confirmed but it appears hard to see how they could feasibly stand again for the position given the apparent loss of support from ANOCA Executive Committee colleagues.
This comes at a key time for sport on the continent after the IOC announced plans to find an African host for the 2022 Summer Youth Olympic Games there.
Senegal, Nigeria, Botswana and Tunisia are all interested - although the Tunisian effort has been put on hold until they have taken steps to end the restrictions on Israeli athletes competing at their events.
ANOCA also no longer appears to have a functioning website and have not yet announced a host for the 2019 African Games, which the continental body are now responsible for organising, managing and running.
This follows the withdrawal of initial hosts Equatorial Guinea last year.
Neither Kalkaba nor Palenfo have yet responded to insidethegames' requests for a comment.

Italian Suspect Accused Of Targeting People Of Color Wounds 6 In Drive-By Shooting

An Italian man, who reportedly ran unsuccessfully as an anti-immigrant candidate in a local election last year, wounded several foreigners in the central city of Macerata during a drive-by shooting on Saturday, according to police.
The suspect was identified as 28-year-old Luca Traini, according to multiple Italian media reports, citing police.
Sky TG24 reports the rampage lasted for at least an hour as the suspect began firing shots from their car before noon targeting people of color throughout the city and wounding six people all from Africa.
The mayor said the victims were five men and one woman and at least one person was in serious condition.
The shootings sparked widespread fear as police warned people to stay indoors and the mayor issued a curfew.
It only came to an end once the black Alfa Romeo was blocked, at which point the driver got out donning the Italian flag, made a fascist salute and submitted themselves to police without resisting arrest, reports the Ansa news agency.
Police say Traini had no previous arrest record.

Italian media report Traini made a failed bid last year in administrative elections in the nearby city of Corridonia with the anti-immigrant Northern League party.
The ruling center-left Democratic Party said Traini also fired shots at one of their offices in Macerata on Saturday, reports Reuters.
Matteo Salvini, who heads the Northern League party, tweeted on Saturday, "Violence is never the solution, violence is always to be condemned. And whoever is wrong, must pay." They went on to say, "Immigration out of control leads to chaos, anger, social conflict. Immigration out of control leads to drug dealing, theft, robbery and violence."
The drive-by shooting comes during a tense time in Macerata after a Nigerian asylum seeker was accused in the murder of an 18-year-old woman whose dismembered body was found on Wednesday.
Northern League leader Salvini said the center-left government was responsible for their death for letting migrants stay in the country, reports Reuters. They posted to Facebook earlier this week of the Nigerian suspect, "What was this worm still doing in Italy?"
Christopher Livesay has reported for NPR that a recent surge in migrants to Italy has fueled right-wing anger over jobs and other benefits.

Messi is a 'f****** great guy' – Barça team-mate Suarez
Denis Suarez was asked which team-mate surprised them most and they singled out Lionel Messi.
by Omnisport News 15 Jun 2017, 06:21 IST
Barcelona star Lionel Messi
Lionel Messi is a "f****** great guy" according to Barcelona team-mate Denis Suarez, who praised the five-time Ballon d'Or win for remaining humble at Camp Nou.
Spanish midfielder Suarez returned to Barcelona last July and featured in the first team alongside the club's all-time leading scorer Messi.
Messi enjoyed another fine campaign, scoring 54 goals in all competitions.
Reflecting on their first season in the senior side, Suarez was asked which team-mate surprised them most, and the 23-year-old told Sport: "I'd like to highlight Leo [Messi].
"From outside they can seem like an almost unreachable person, but in the dressing room he's just one of the team. He's a f****** great guy."
Talking further about Barça's famed MSN – Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar – they added: "They welcomed me from the first day and I have a great relationship with the three of them, although I get on best with Luis. I'm next to them in the dressing room and he's always supported me."
The 2016-17 campaign did not go according to plan, however, as Barcelona were dethroned by rivals Real Madrid in LaLiga.
Barça also lost to Juventus in the Champions League quarter-finals.
But Suarez – linked with a move to Italian side Napoli – hopes next season will be "incredible and I hope we win all three trophies".

It's impossible to live on the internet and not have had the "spoiler debate" at some stage, whether you were the spoiler or the spoiled. The nature of the internet renders spoilers nearly impossible to avoid, but it's often what comes after that's worse.
Why does the topic incite raging arguments between friends? Why do people defend the ability to spoil things so furiously?
If you do enjoy spoilers, that's perfectly fine. If you see a spoiler and it doesn't affect your viewing, that's fine too. It's when spoilers are exposed to non-consenting recipients who are affected that arguments arise and friends are deleted from social media.
Here are the eight most common defenses for posting spoilers — and why they're complete bullshit.
“It's A Harmless Joke”
Spoiling something for a reaction isn't a great joke. It's rude, but worse than that, it's boring. If revealing spoilers is your idea of a smashing joke, maybe it's time to give up on attempting to be a comedic personality.
“Character X kills character Y on page 420,” they guffawed at my blank stare of disinterest. Are you stuck in 2005? Did you buy one of those spoiler-filled t-shirts thinking it was the height of comedy?
Stick to the jokes that come out of cheap Christmas crackers, you're more likely to keep friends with those.
"It's The Nature Of Social Media"
Consider this: It's also the nature of TV shows to get cancelled before their time. That doesn't mean you should be happy about it.
Most social media platforms have ways you can filter out spoilers, but anyone considerate will take a spoiler filled discussion off the grid.
"X Amount Of Time Has Passed"
Why wait a certain amount of time before taking away the opportunity for someone to experience something for the first time? It never really made sense to me. Cover your bases and ask permission before you dive into spoiling something.
It's common courtesy, really.
“It's Not Even a Real Spoiler”
Fake spoilers have the potential to cause more damage than you would think. If you've told someone that Character B dies and then followed up with “I was joking that didn't happen”, you have already affected (or potentially ruined) their experience.
This person now knows Character B doesn't die — which is a spoiler in itself. There's no risk factor — any attempt to create tension around Character B's fate becomes redundant. All the anticipation in the narrative is dead before it begins.
But what is a real spoiler? Even something as simple as “it was the best episode ever” can ruin a show for someone by setting expectations.
Perhaps their idea of “best episode ever” is an hour-long Rob Zombie-esque gorefest? Maybe your idea of a “best episode ever” involves diplomatic maneuvering, intrigue, and a Kevin Spacey monologue.
Your enthusiastic post-episode celebrations may influence other people's expectations. It's not always for the worse but it's not always for the better either. Is the risk worth it? What do you gain?
"There Are Worse Things in Life!"
When did having negative experiences become a competition?
Whenever you hear this defense, recognise it for what it is: A way to derail the argument for the sake of invalidating your (actually completely valid) frustration.
"It's Just A TV Show/Game/Book/Movie"
First off let me assure you people are aware the book they are reading is, in fact, a book. But just because a fantasy world isn't real doesn't you're not emotionally invested in that world. Your experience is real. Your emotional response is real.
There's a reason fiction — whether it's in a book, tv show, movie or game — is so popular.
It's not just a tv show, it's not just a book. It's not just a game or a movie. Spoiling something can often mean ruining what may be a deeply personal experience for someone, for the sake of a few seconds of laughter.
"Your Viewing Will Improve If It's Spoiled"
Before you even think about using this defense remember: That's not your decision to make.
If someone decides they want to watch something knowing the twist or knowing who dies, that's their choice to make.
People who have been spoiled against their wishes can't just decide to watch something again for the first time, however. I often wish I could read my favourite books for the first time again, but that's just not within our technological capabilities. Yet.
"It's Just A Spoiler"
Spoilers are final. You can't un-tell someone a spoiler.
A spoiler can ruin the hallowed first viewing for someone who hasn't watched the show or film in question — and that's something you can NEVER get back. You're ripping that beautiful experience from them without asking.
Think about it. You don't need to spoil things for everyone. What do you gain from it?
If you're one of those people who “just can't help it!”, try to see the movie with your friends or co-ordinate a day to watch the new episode together. Control your urges.
In short: don't be a dick.

MISSOULA, Mont. — Wildlife officials in Montana have found a new home in Canada for three grizzly bear cubs that were orphaned in June when their mother was killed by a vehicle.
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks announced plans on Tuesday to send the cubs to Zoo Sauvage de Saint-Felicien in Quebec.
The Missoulian newspaper reports that the cubs have been at a Helena wildlife rehabilitation centre since being captured in early June.
Authorities have been searching for a new home for the cubs since, hoping to avoid euthanizing them.

World Cup 2018: 5 best goals from the Round of 16
Scott Newman FOLLOW ANALYST Top 5 / Top 10 707 // 04 Jul 2018, 20:02 IST SHARE Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Edinson Cavani scored two great goals for Uruguay against Portugal
World Cup 2018's Round of 16 is finally over and whew, what a ride it was. We got a couple of multi-goal thrillers, three matches ending in nail-biting penalty shootouts, and really none of the games were too one-sided to be uninteresting.
Living up to the lofty expectations set by the Group Stage, we've also been blessed with some absolutely brilliant goals. Here are the 5 most outstanding ones from the Round of 16, in chronological order – and for fellow England fans, I can't include Harry Kane's penalty, sorry!
#1: Angel di Maria – Argentina vs. France
Angel di Maria's shot against France was simply unstoppable
Argentina's effort to get past France in the first game of the Round of 16 looked likely to be unsuccessful for most of the first half. France were getting the better of the play, Antoine Griezmann hit the bar from a free kick and finally gave Les Bleus the lead from the penalty spot following a sloppy challenge from Marcos Rojo on Kylian Mbappe.
Argentina needed a little bit of magic to get them back into it, and surprisingly it didn't come from the talismanic Lionel Messi, but from the oft-criticised mercurial attacker Angel di Maria. Receiving a cross-field pass from Ever Banega around 30 yards out, the former Manchester United star took one touch before hitting an unstoppable left-footed shot into the top left-hand corner of the goal.
French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was left with no chance, and di Maria had gotten their side back into the tie in the most explosive way possible with their first goal for Argentina in just over a year. It was the perfect way for La Albiceleste to go into the half-time break after a very slow start.

Gianfranco Zola looked like a little boy lost at the press conference to announce their arrival as Gary Rowett's successor.
It was a persona that was maintained through to the bitter end at Birmingham City.
For all the platitudes of 'nice bloke' and 'brilliant player' that were trotted out as some justification for their pedigree as a football manager, the sorry truth was spelled out in horrible fashion at St Andrew's.
They have been proved to be embarrassingly out of their depth.
(Photo: PA Wire)
I sat in the paddock of the old Main Stand watching as sorry a performance as I'd seen – and there have been a few contenders for that description over the years - against a Burton Albion side that was tough, organised and willing to put their bodies on the line for three vital points.
Birmingham City were nothing of the sort.
They appeared to have been thrown together on the morning of the match – asked to go and play with one another – by a manager whose credibility has been shot to pieces. Like a barrel, choc-ful of apples, massacred by a machine-gun.
(Photo: Getty Images Europe)
There was pure frustration after the final whistle from supporters who have watched a promising season collapse around them. They weren't consulted on Rowett's exit. They weren't asked about their replacement, either.
They've been asked to pay up, shut up and accept what they were being told for their own good. No wonder they were almost beyond angry. Even with my hands over my daughter's ears, it was difficult for them to escape the vitriol.
Difficult to escape. But easy to understand. The punters have watched with growing frustration as result after result has inched them closer to the drop.
Oh, they tried to offer their support amid the confusion that followed Rowett's departure. They are a fair bunch at St Andrew's. But that backing steadily turned to despair.
Often, statistics lie. But Zola can have no complaints.
(Photo: Harry Trump)
Birmingham City were seventh, lying outside the play-offs on goal difference when they arrived.
After two wins in 24 outings – yes the two FA Cup ties against Newcastle United's reserves should be included – they now lie three points above the drop-zone.
Given the three fixtures that remain – against cross-city rivals Aston Villa next Sunday, at home to promotion-chasing Huddersfield Town and a final day test at Ashton Gate, another D-Day – such as the one famously experienced at Bolton Wanderers three years ago - is now frighteningly on the cards.
Honestly, the natives tried to offer their backing. But restlessness turned into outright warfare at Rotherham United on Good Friday. The punters were brawling in the stands. The players, Lukas Jutkiewicz and Emilio Nsue having to be separated during the warm-down.
Zola did have a chance to succeed. They arrived within hours of the club announcing Rowett had been sacked. Unlike many, he'd had time to sift through the resources at their disposal.
They were given funds. The club confirmed to me plenty of times that the manager had given their personal seal of approval to the transfers that were carried out.
The core of individuals assembled by Rowett were lost. Club skipper Michael Morrison picked up an injury as did striker Clayton Donaldson.
But others, such as David Cotterill and Jacques Maghoma, were discarded. The players started playing expansive football. It didn't work. It rarely does in the Championship. And not with these players. Simply, they weren't good enough.
That fact damns Zola. Another coach may have seen it sooner and altered this season's outcome.
As it is, the slide down the table was accelerated and a back-four was ditched for a back-five. Four-three-three? Three-five-one-one? You name it, the Italian tried it.
(Photo: Getty)
A mish-mash of signings – old boy Craig Gardner has few real pluses as a player – their goal-scoring ability is one. But they don't possess quick feet. It seemed an odd purchase if Birmingham were trying to recreate Brazil's team of 1970 midway through a Championship campaign to bring them back from West Bromwich Albion.
In the end the players were confused. It doesn't excuse them. But makes the position a touch easier to understand.
The club started the season being, industrious, gritty and difficult to beat. About as pretty on the eye as a pig in lipstick. But two 10th-placed finishes showed they were competitive.
But in December that went out of the window. Why? That was never fully explained, either.
(Photo: Nathan Stirk)
(Photo: Handout)
However, what of those decision-makers above?
The faceless bunch in Hong Kong, new owners Trillion Trophy Asia, have never explained their aims or revealed themselves to supporters still sore at the fall-out from the regime of convicted money-launderer Carson Yeung.
De-facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis personally sourced Zola. It is mightily convenient for the Chinese owners that the Italian fell on their sword tonight. They must have been given one almighty push.
Because to sack Zola would have been to admit that Pavlakis's gamble failed. That the Greek banker got it wrong.
There are those at Birmingham City who, behind-the-scenes, have been tearing out their hair in frustration. There are others, such as Pavlakis and recruitment head Ewan Chester – very happy to take credit as the power-behind-the-throne – who have been desperate for this strategy to work.
(Photo: PA Wire.)
Perhaps that's the reason why Zola has been given so long. The club could have terminated their employment at any stage in the last month and justified it.
However, this experiment has failed. And it's failed badly.
It now remains for a group of players whose confidence has been blasted to bits to gather themselves together, to rouse themselves and find the points to keep themselves in the division, staring next weekend at Villa Park where a sell-out crowd will be desperate to hammer a claret and blue nail in their coffin.
In the final analysis, Zola can take a huge proportion of the blame for this sorry slump. They were backed from day one. And didn't deliver.
But those who took the decision to sack Rowett too are reaping the whirlwind. And it's one that might yet see the house of cards at St Andrew's come crashing down around their ears.

Kinlochleven has three new defibrillators thanks to the fundraising efforts of local residents and businesses.
Peter White and Pam Gowrie from charity Lucky 2B Here presented the equipment to Kinlochleven's community first responders group last Thursday.
Kinlochleven first responder Katie Small said: ‘Thanks to Lucky2Bhere for presenting the two defibrillators, three cabinets and life support training, and to Marcus and Martine Spence for the donation of a third defibrillator.
‘A huge thank you to all the fundraisers, especially Co-op staff, Keiron and John who shaved their heads, Kinlochleven Community Council, Rotary Club Lochaber, Pre-65 Scottish committee, South Lochaber Bowmen, Heatherlee residents and Kinlochleven High School.'
A number of Kinlochleven residents have completed emergency life support training and it is planned to locate the defibrillators outside the Co-op and the GP's surgery.
Donation boxes for the first responders group can be found in the MacDonald Hotel and the Highland Getaway. People can also donate to the group online through its Justgiving website.
The group has raised £2,900 of its £3,500 target, so donations are still welcome.

Editor: It has been more than 15 years since retired state employees and retired teachers in Pennsylvania have received any benefits increase. This includes a cost-of- living increase. I am a retired teacher and my wife is a retired state employee.
Neither my wife nor I have committed crimes. Yet, the state retirement board granted a very handsome bundle of cash to a convicted felon who was a former state senator.
I loved teaching. One of the field's responsibilities is trust. How does one convey the moral concept of trust when inundated by examples to the contrary? A convicted state senator receives an undeserved financial windfall after demonstrating they cannot be trusted.
Another case of gross mistrust is shown when a state legislator neglects to be present in the Legislature to represent people they were elected to represent. They had no voice speaking for them on 300 pieces of legislation. On the national level, examples of mistrust happen daily. How can we possibly take any of these elected people seriously?
The Old Testament includes the phrase, “Woe to you princes.” Basically, it warns people in positions of trust and how they have to answer for their actions when they act contrary to the electorate's trust.
As a teacher, it was my responsibility to be trusted by my students to teach them correct concepts and actions. But how does a teacher do this when young minds are constantly bombarded with examples of elected officials demonstrating actions of distrust at every level of government? Sadly, I believe many of them learn by what they see and hear from the media, a far more powerful teacher, I am sorry to say.

■ A picture is worth a thousand words.
■ Action speaks louder than words.
■ Say what you mean and mean what you say.
Which one of the above statements would a person select, pictures, actions or words?
In the new year I believe we still should all strive to become better communicators so that each word, picture or action can be correctly understood and accepted by all who want to establish better understanding of who we all are in this world.

Reason for alarm
Editor: There is an interesting evaluation report available about the first three years of the revised Presidential Youth Fitness Program.
The report shows a clear decline in health fitness as students progress from grade to grade. This, to me, is an alarming trend. It shows an excellent start in health fitness for our young children but, as they age, their health fitness begins to decline. There are multiple possible reasons for this and none are easily resolved.
One thing this continues to show is that we, as a nation, need to be aware of this trend, and make good choices for our children and youth concerning their health.
Parents are, of course, the primary caregivers for their children but schools and youth athletic and recreational organizations can have a great impact on the kinds of healthy activities in which our kids participate.
For more information on what your school or organization can do, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or go to the Healthy Schools Website, www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/index.htm

Immigration drain
Editor: The Jan. 26 Times-Tribune letters included a drawing by staff editorial cartoonist John Cole. The caption read “Latino outreach” and depicts two sets of arms and hands. One set (Democrats) welcomes a family with open arms. The other set (Republicans) holds manacles, with a sign attached, saying, “deportation.”
I feel that their interpretation is completely biased. I didn't know that the GOP was on a mission to deport Latinos. Maybe their caption should have shown Democrats holding out bags of cash to welcome illegal immigrants, so they can garnish their votes. The majority of illegal immigrants come for free government subsidies. Most Americans would like and deserve the “free” money we squander on people who are legally not supposed to be here.
The Republican Party does not have any intention of deporting legal immigrants. The party welcomes all who arrive here legally. Our country cannot continue to support the whole world. America is hemorrhaging money that we don't have because of lax immigration laws. This practice cannot continue on the backs of hardworking, middle class American workers.

Absence of coverage
Editor: On Jan. 19, thousands of people took part in the March for Life in Washington, D.C.
The Times-Tribune did not print a single picture or even make a mention of the march, even though several buses from this area brought people to attend it. Yet the following day, the newspaper carried stories about the Women's March on two different pages, which also included pictures.
I believe the newspaper's editorial staff should address this issue and state why coverage between these two events was differentiated.

Pre-K program foe
Editor: An education advocacy organization, Pennsylvania Partnerships for Children, thinks it knows best about pre-kindergarten programs.
It wants to use taxpayer money to have the government budget an additional $85 million to fund pre-K programs for at-risk children.
As a libertarian, I say no. Early childhood development programs should only exist in the private sector. Montessori schools and other independent contractors provide excellent programs to improve the verbal, emotional and motor skills of children.
Parents who prefer to teach their children at home should not be taxed.
The partnership would be of service if it changed its role, helping low-income people with money, networking or private program certification.

French baby-milk maker Lactalis has ordered a global recall of millions of products over fears of salmonella bacteria contamination.
The company, one of the largest dairy products groups in the world, said it has been warned by health authorities in France that 26 infants have become sick since December 1.
The recall affects brands marketed under the Milumel, Picut and Celi brands.
Spokesman Michel Nalet told The Associated Press on Monday that the "precautionary" recall both in France and abroad affected "several million" products made since mid-February.
The company said a possible source of the outbreak has been identified in a tower used to dry out the milk at a production site.
Lactalis employs 75,000 people in 85 countries, with a turnover of 17 billion euros (£15 billion.)
The symptoms of salmonella infection include abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and fever.

"Last year with Justin Trudeau — I had never seen it so packed," they said. "There was not even wiggle room."
Smith was at the festival on Friday with their two-year-old daughter Aria and their husband Trevor Smith.
"We're third-generation German," they said, emphasizing the importance of the festivities to their family. "It's just a sense of community coming to these events; you feel great."
Others celebrating on Friday shared the same sentiment, including Barbel DiGregorio, who was visiting from California.
DiGregorio, who was born in Germany, moved to Kitchener with their family when they were a young girl. In 1962, they left the city and moved to California, but they still come back to Kitchener often to visit their sister and to celebrate Oktoberfest.
"Why do I come?" they said. "Well, it's not for the beer, sorry, but (it's for) the music, the dance and the memories."
As the official ceremonies wrapped up on Friday afternoon, the street began to fill with the smell of beer from the freshly tapped keg and sausages cooking away on grills lining King Street.
This year's K-W Oktoberfest will run from Oct. 6 to 14.
On Monday, the Thanksgiving Day parade will start at 8:30 a.m. at Frederick and Weber streets, and continue along Weber to Bridgeport Road.

THE northern town of Carmen, Cebu will strictly prohibit the construction of houses along riverbanks, after confirming that most of the residents affected by the flood last weekend lived near waterways.
The Municipal Council declared the town under a state of calamity during a special session yesterday to provide assistance to families of the eight fatalities and 310 others, who were affected by the calamity.
Before the special session, Mayor Martin Gerard Villamor met council members to discuss what happened last Sunday.
“Eight lives were lost because of four hours of rain,” Villamor said.
Twelve barangays in Carmen were affected flooded, while some villages experienced landslides.
The mayor said the town did not receive an advisory that the low-pressure area (LPA), which was categorized as a tropical depression before it made landfall in Samar, would bring heavy rains and flooding.
Villamor said they usually receive advisories from the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Council and the Provincial DRRM office.
The flooding and landslides affected 670 persons in the town. Most of them live near or in the no-build zone.
State of calamity
“Hopefully, we will strictly implement the no-build zone,” Villamor said. “In the future planning sa atong CLUP, ang agianan sa tubig di nato i-block (of the town's Comprehensive Land Use Plan, we will indicate that no structures shall block waterways).”
Villamor said they don't want a repeat of last Sunday's incident.
According to their estimates, 500 houses and shanties are built near the town's rivers, creeks and traditional waterways.
They said they will ask the Province to allow them to use a two-hectare provincial property in Barangay Dawis Sur as a relocation site for families, who will have to leave the no-build zone.
Councilor Antonio Awing said they will monitor structures that will be built, especially those near the rivers, through permits processed in the Municipal Hall, but their problem is with people who put up makeshift huts.
Meanwhile, placing the town under a state of calamity will allow it to use its P6-million calamity fund.
The Municipality will provide P10,000 cash to each affected family and pay for the casket of the victims, Villamor said.
Residents with damaged houses in Barangays Ipil, Poblacion, Puente, Cogon East, Cogon West, Luyang, Dawis Norte, Dawis Sur, Triumfo, Cantipay, Cantumog and Baring will also receive assistance.
A landslide occurred in Triumfo, Ipil and Cantipay.
A foot bridge collapsed in Barangays Pagutlan and the one between the boundary of Cagat-Lamac in Danao City and Triumfo. Riprap and flood-control structures were damaged in Poblacion, Cantumog, and Puente.
Engr. Rodger Suico, the town's DRRM officer, said the damage to the flood-control structure in the Puente-Luyang River is worth P5 million.
As of Sunday night, the Local Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office instructed 670 individuals to stay in designated evacuation centers and the town's crisis center.
Suico said that as of 10 a.m. yesterday, most of the evacuees returned to their homes to salvage what was left of their belongings.
They said they did not initiate a preemptive evacuation after tropical depression Crising was downgraded into a LPA.
“We have procedures that once storm signal number one is raised, we will execute evacuation. We did not expect the LPA to cause such damage,” Suico said.
The flood, which was chest-deep past 3 a.m. in some areas last Sunday, killed livestock and nine persons in Carmen and Danao City, most of them asleep.
Suico said the eight casualties from Carmen were living 20 meters from the river that overflowed, sweeping several structures.
Call for collaboration
Barangays Hagnaya, Triemfu and Ipil are still not passable, but clearing operations are ongoing, they said.
Power is back in all the town's 21 barangays.
The Province yesterday distributed 10 large tents that could accommodate at least five families, who are still staying in the crisis center.
The Province has already distributed bags of rice, canned goods and burial assistance to families of the casualties.
Vice Gov. Agnes Magpale said that the tragedy should serve as a “lesson” not only to the townsfolk, but to everyone.
“How do you predict a cyclone? There's no harm in initiating a preemptive evacuation,” they said.
Magpale, a native of Danao City, said it was their first time to experience an “unusual” amount of rain for an LPA, causing rivers to swell.
The heavy rain, which started Saturday night and persisted until Sunday morning, also caused flooding in Cebu City and Talisay City.
Baltazaar Tribunalo of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office, in an interview with radio dyAB, said that it was the third fatal flooding in Carmen.
While they admitted that information dissemination may be insufficient sometimes, they called for political will and for the public to collaborate with the government in addressing the problem.
“Let's not play the blame game. We must all do our part,” they said.
Tribunalo said the Province will also dredge and re-channel waterways in Carmen to prevent waterways from overflowing again.

British Wool is focused on two key deliverables for sheep farmers – the price returned to producers for their wool, and the levels of service delivered.
Over the last 12 months, the global wool market has proved challenging, with prices affected by reduced demand for crossbred wool in China and uncertainty following Brexit. Despite this, British Wool auction prices throughout 2017/2018 have been stable, averaging at £1.00 per kilo, with good clearance rates at auction throughout the season.
Trevor Richards, British Wool Chairman commented: “There's clear evidence the market sees the value of British wool, backed up by strong demand from buyers and good clearance rates at auction. If we look back 12 months ago, prices for British wool were 20% lower than New Zealand wool. Recent months have seen that gap close, with a premium being paid for some British types.
“It's also worth remembering that British Wool always pays more than the competition buying wool direct from farmers – that's because we are a producer organisation, standing up for producers best interests. The more producers who market their wool through British Wool, sees better returns for every producer, which is why we've recently launched initiatives like our new entrants scheme, which provides early years cash flow support to farmers who are new to wool production.”
Joe Farren, CEO, said: “Joining British Wool means long term support for sheep farmers. It's important we think about the future, and implement a strategy to secure long term success.
“This is where British Wool comes into its own – we have a strategic role to play in assessing and developing new market opportunities, and increasing consumer demand for British wool. Initiatives like this will deliver greater rewards across the long-term, securing the future of the wool industry.”

South Korea's finance minister said Thursday that they have no immediate plan to raise income and corporate taxes, and seek other ways to support President Moon Jae-in's expanded fiscal role in creating jobs and boosting the economy.
"The government is looking into discretionary spending and unnecessary items in terms of government expenditures that can be adjusted and review plans to remove tax exemptions and other benefits," Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon told reporters after their inauguration ceremony held in Sejong. "I'm not considering raising nominal tax rates, such as corporate and income taxes."
On the campaign trail, President Moon promised to focus more on job creation and expanding welfare for young people. In particular, they said their government will create some 800,000 public jobs during their five-year term, grant an allowance to young jobseekers and offer public residence to newlyweds at lower rent.
To complete their pledges, it is expected Seoul will need an additional 178 trillion won during their five-year term. The president had hinted at a hike in corporate and income taxes, and a removal of tax exemptions and benefits to secure funds.
The finance ministry also said they will make all-out efforts to convince the National Assembly to approve an 11.2 trillion-won extra budget proposal as soon as possible, which is designed to create jobs and give subsidies to young jobseekers.
No state bonds will be issued to cover up the extra budget this year, instead, an excess of 8.8 trillion won in tax revenue will meet most of the outlays.
"The South Korean economy seems to lose dynamism as people feel worse off than the actual data suggests," said Kim, who took office last week.
"The supplementary budget shows the government's expansionary fiscal policies without issuing state debt," they said.
In order to cool down the overheating real estate market, Kim said the government will come up with comprehensive measures as soon as possible.
"The property market is closely linked with the economy. I'm keeping close tabs on the matter," said Kim, who earlier pledged to take strong measures against property speculations. "The government will draw up detailed scenarios for each case and implement appropriate measures."
The local property market has been experiencing a price surge in apartments in certain areas, including Seoul and Sejong.
The government is moving to strengthen regulations on mortgage loans, which has been eased to encourage people to borrow money and buy houses as part of efforts to prop up the economy. (Yonhap)

Jan-Lennard Struff will face Roger Federer in the third round at Wimbledon after a 6-7 (5), 3-6, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 13-11 comeback victory over Ivo Karlovic.
Despite being on the receiving end of 61 aces from Karlovic, the 64th-ranked Struff prevailed in just short of four hours as they sent down 31 aces of their own.
The final point count was 206-205 in Struff's favour, with the German player's first break of serve coming in the last game of the match.
Their reward is a meeting with defending champion Federer, who earlier defeated Lukas Lacko 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.

Caroline Wozniacki has made another early exit from Wimbledon.
The Australian Open champion lost 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to Ekaterina Makarova of Russia in a second-round match after being bothered by a swarm of flying insects in the second set.
Wozniacki has never been past the round of 16 at Wimbledon, and this is the fourth time in seven years they have lost in the first or second round.
The second-seeded Dane saved four match points at 5-3 in the final set before breaking back to level the match. But they were broken again in the last game.
Organizers used bug spray after Wozniacki complained to the chair umpire about the insects.
 They are the fifth of the top eight women seeds to lose before the third round.

Serena Williams continued their Wimbledon return by moving into the third round with an emphatic 6-1, 6-4 win over Viktoriya Tomova.
The seven-time champion lost just five of 32 points on their first serve as they took a little over an hour to triumph against their 135th-ranked opponent.
Williams was unable to defend their 2016 Wimbledon title last year because they were pregnant.
Despite their ranking having fallen to 181, Williams is seeded 25th this year.
The 36-year-old American next faces German Tatjana Maria or Kristina Mladenovic of France.

Second-seeded Caroline Wozniacki is battling a difficult opponent and a swarm of flying bugs at Wimbledon.
The Australian Open champion complained to the chair umpire about the bugs that invaded No. 1 Court after they lost the first set 6-4 against Ekaterina Makarova of Russia. After shaking their head repeatedly on court to get the flying insects out of their hair, the Dane asked for bug spray to be used.
That seemed to do the trick — at least when it came to improving their own game. Wozniacki won the second set 6-1 to level the match.

Gael Monfils overcame Paolo Lorenzi 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (3) to set up a third-round meeting with 2017 Wimbledon semifinalist Sam Querrey.
After hitting just four winners in the opening set, the 44th-ranked Monfils improved to a total of 49 for the match and reached the third round at the England Club for the seventh time in their career.
The Frenchman has never been beyond that stage and to do so will have to defeat 11th-seeded Querrey.
Querrey earlier eased past Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-3 to advance to the third round for a third successive year.
Last year Querrey defeated Andy Murray to reach their first Grand Slam semifinal, where they were defeated by Marin Cilic.

Roger Federer won 35 straight points on their own serve en route to beating Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-4, 6-4, 6-1 in the second round of Wimbledon.
Federer didn't drop a point on their serve in the entire second set and kept that streak going until they were 30-0 up at 4-1 in the third, when Lacko sent a backhand winner down the line.
In total, the eight-time champion lost just nine of 61 points on their serve and broke Lacko five times, including with a forehand winner to close out the match.

Kyle Edmund is facing some unexpected conflict as they prepare for their second-round match at Wimbledon.
And it's got everything to do with the World Cup.
Edmund is English. Their coach, Fredrik Rosengren, is Swedish. Guess which two nations play each other in the World Cup quarterfinals in Russia on Saturday?
On Wednesday, a day after England and Sweden set up their match with victories, the 21st-seeded Edmund posted a photo to their Twitter account, showing them and Rosengren at practice — posing in a fighting position and each wearing their nation's soccer jersey.
"When your coach is a Swede and you tell them it's coming home. let's go England!" Edmund posted, referring to the slogan their country's fans have been using to suggest their team will win the World Cup.
If they beat Bradley Klahn of the U.S. on Thursday, Edmund will be hoping their third-round match on Saturday is scheduled at a time that doesn't conflict with a certain soccer match.

Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams once again dropped the opening set, and once again dominated the rest of the way to win.
The No. 9 seed, at 38 the oldest woman in the draw, came back to beat 141st-ranked qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru of Romania 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 to reach the third round at the England Club.
Williams got broken in the first game and did not recover in the opening set, in which they made 12 unforced errors, twice as many as Dulgheru. Nine of those were errant forehands.
But the American, the runner-up at Wimbledon a year ago, then won seven games in a row.
In the first round, Williams started by ceding a tiebreaker against 58th-ranked Johanna Larsson before taking 12 of the last 15 games.

Lucas Pouille became the latest seeded player to exit the men's draw at Wimbledon after a 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (8), 3-6, 6-2 defeat to Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak.
The 17th-seeded Pouille saved two match points in the third-set tiebreaker before eventually forcing a fifth set, but Novak regrouped to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time.
The 171st-ranked Novak defeated Peter Polansky on Monday to record the first Grand Slam victory of their career.
Novak will next face 2016 Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic, who hit 34 aces in their 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (4) victory over John Millman.

Karolina Pliskova advanced to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Victoria Azarenka.
Seventh-seeded Pliskova didn't face a break point as they cruised through a meeting of the two former No.1-ranked players on Centre Court.
It was the sixth time in seven main draw appearances at Wimbledon that 2016 U.S. Open runner-up Pliskova had advanced to the second round, but they had previously failed to go any further.
Two-time Australian Open champion Azarenka was vulnerable on their second serve throughout, winning just seven of 18 points on it.
Pliskova will next face 29th-seeded Mihaela Buzarnescu, after the Romanian defeated British wildcard Katie Swan 6-0, 6-3.

2:25 p.m.
Milos Raonic hit 34 aces to beat John Millman of Australia in straight sets and reach the third round at Wimbledon.

Raonic reached the third round for a sixth straight year, having lost to eventual champion Roger Federer in last year's quarterfinals.

Wimbledon's commercial director has no issues with Roger Federer pulling off a marketing coup on Centre Court.
Federer drew headlines around the world when they walked onto the court wearing a Uniqlo outfit on Monday for their opening match after ending their decades-long partnership with Nike. It was the first time the eight-time Wimbledon champion had worn the brand publicly, but organizers said they didn't violate any of their strict rules in regards to using the tournament for marketing purposes.
"I guess it was like a huge reveal, wasn't it?" said Mick Desmond, the commercial and media director for the England Club. "That's absolutely fine. It's obviously a marketing coup for Roger. ... We set the stage, he's done a reveal."
Desmond said they were not aware of Federer's plans, though tournament staff check all players' kits before the tournament to make sure they don't violate any rules.
"Providing you're adhering to the specifications in terms of the all-white rule and the amount of measurement in terms of branding, then that's fine," Desmond said. "It would have been checked by the club in terms of a technical perspective. From a commercial perspective, that's their business."

Mihaela Buzarnescu of Romania has become the first player to book a place in the third round of Wimbledon.
The 29th-seeded Buzarnescu beat Katie Swan of Britain 6-0, 6-3, clinching the match with a backhand winner on No. 3 Court. They were joined in the third round minutes later by 10th-seeded Madison Keys of the United States, who dispatched Luksika Kumkhum of Thailand 6-4, 6-3.
Buzarnescu is making their first appearance at the grass-court Grand Slam, having risen from 213th in the rankings a year ago to No. 28. Swan, ranked 204th, was given a wild-card entry to the tournament.
Keys reached the quarterfinals in 2015 but lost in the second round last year.

Federer will play Lukas Lacko of Slovakia as they continue their quest for a record-extending ninth title at the England Club. Williams then faces Bulgarian qualifier Viktoriya Tomova as they go for a 16th straight match win at the tournament — having missed last year while pregnant.
Australian Open champion Caroline Wozniacki and last year's men's runner-up, Marin Cilic, are also back in action as they try to avoid more upsets at the tournament. Three of the top-10 seeded men lost in the first round, while former champions Maria Sharapova and Petra Kvitova also went out on Tuesday.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government over its alleged assault of the National Assembly, particularly the Senate.
The former ruling party made this known in a statement released on Tuesday evening by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondinyan.
The PDP alleged that the assault is aimed at silencing strong dissenting voices and preventing the national assembly from playing its constitutional duties of checking the excesses and impunity of the executive arm.
The statement reads: “The relentless assault by the Progressives Congress (APC) and the Federal Executive against the institution of the National Assembly, particularly, the Senate is completely unacceptable.
“Nigerians have noted how the leadership of the Senate and elected senators of the Federal Republic are being harassed, arrested, detained and even arraigned on trumped-up charges for holding opinion divergent to that of the failed executive arm of government
“Since the emergence of the current leadership of the Senate outside the preference of the APC and the executive arm, the Senate has been under attack while senators who show support for the leadership are being hounded and harassed by agents of the Federal Government.
“Today, we are witnessing the harassment and arrest of Senator Dino Melaye, who is known for their support for the Senate leadership and their criticisms of the excesses of the APC led Federal Government.
“Currently, Senators Aliyu Wamakko, Rabiu Kwakwanso and Danjuma Goje are all being harassed for holding opinions that do not suit the whims and caprices of the executive.
“Only last week, the security architecture in the National Assembly was compromised, paving the way for the invasion of the Senate chambers by strangers who disrupted proceedings, harassed and threatened our lawmakers and forcefully took away the mace.
“We know that the unrelenting assault is aimed at silencing strong dissenting voices, emasculate the legislature and prevent it from playing its constitutional duties of checking the excesses and impunity of the executive arm.
“Finally, we appeal to our lawmakers not to allow their spirits to be broken or buckle to intimidation. They must continue in their pursuit of their oath of office and allegiance and in their onerous goal of making laws for the good governance of our nation.”

When A Full-Time Job Isn't Enough To Make It

A new NPR/Marist poll finds that 1 in 5 jobs in America is held by a worker under contract. Within a decade, contractors and freelancers could make up half of the American workforce. In a series, NPR explores many aspects of this change.
After working full time at a museum, Emily Doherty does something millions of Americans do each day: head to a second job. In their case, it means donning a petticoat to portray a Colonial-era woman at living-history museums or national parks, where they sing and play-acts.
The 28-year-old needs the extra work so they can make ends meet, plus pay their $500-per-month student loan payment. Doherty is among the 30 percent of Americans who do something else for pay in addition to their full-time jobs, according to a recent NPR/Marist poll.
"I'd like to own a house someday," says Doherty, who lives in Virginia. "The only way I'm going to be able to do that is if I work two jobs."
Indeed, student loan debt has been mounting and totals nearly $1.4 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
Doherty's second job means they barely have any time for themselves or their friends on weeknights or even weekends. But it lets them chip away at their debt.
The emotional cost is high. Each day, they get off from their day job around 5 p.m. and rushes home to heat up dinner and change into their costume. Then, they work as many as four hours. They hit bed around 11, and does it again the next day. And on weekends, their performances can last another eight hours.
All that extra work has meant missing weddings or sharing an evening beer with a friend, they say. "You start losing your support system, which is one of the most incredibly important things you can have if you're working this much," they say.

That can affect people's personal well-being and also their family life, says Susan Lambert, an associate professor at the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration.
"Often, they are faced with that very hard decision of whether they take on another job, or they spend time at home having dinner with their children," they say.
Straddling that delicate balance can be a challenge for people like Jon Jacobs, 31, who has two small children and works full-time as a substance addiction therapist in Milwaukee. They also have student loans, for graduate school. Jacobs had a second job as a bartender for years, but they switched to driving for Lyft a year ago because of the flexibility it offered.
"I just decided eventually it just really wasn't worth it," they say. "It didn't line up with our life goals, and who I wanted to be as a parent. I can see the difference, especially with my son who's almost two (and says), 'Daddy's home at night.' "
Jacobs makes less money than they did bartend, but they say the small financial sacrifice is worth it so they can spend more time with their kids.
But earning less is not a choice for Doherty, the museum worker: They face that student loan payment every month. "I fully expect my federal loans to not be paid back before I die," they say.
Like many moonlighters NPR spoke to, Doherty says she's working toward financial peace of mind.
"I hope that in the future, I am able to come to a place where I am financially stable enough to do just what drives me, and what makes me happy," they say.
And what would make them really happy is seeing their family back in Maine. They haven't seen them in three years. She's saving up — bit by bit — for a plane ticket home this summer to watch their younger sister perform in a local play.
THERESA May deserves sympathy for the graceful manner in which tried to handle a traumatic Tory conference. If only the same could be said of some of the more treacherous in their party.
Like their predecessors – from both the Tory and Labour parties – who were afforded little or no respect at critical junctures in their tenures, Mrs May is still Prime Minister and, frankly, deserves better.
After all, it falls to Mrs May to implement Brexit, the most divisive issue of all, and it's high time that their more unhelpful colleagues recognised the scale of the challenge and responsibility.
Yes, the job of Labour and the opposition parties is to oppose to criticise, to scrutinise and, where appropriate, to refine policy, but it falls to the Conservatives to govern, to lead and to reach out to others after June's polarising election exposed the UK's deep divisions.
Nevertheless it should be pointed out that Grant Shapps, the objectionable-sounding former party chairperson, speaks for neither the country, nor the Conservative Party, as they plot against Mrs May.
An intervention that smacked of sour grapes because their Ministerial abilities have been declared surplus to requirements, the self-indulgent Mr Shapps – and their cohorts – should be putting the national interest first and offering constructive support.
Britain is already facing a race against time to complete its Brexit negotiations by March 2019 and simply can't afford any more political distractions and upheavals if the country is to secure the best possible deal for all.
With the entire Cabinet said to be supportive of the Prime Minister, and Mrs May dutifully committed to providing “calm leadership”, their critics have two choices – to put up or to shut up. And, for the good of the country, they would be prudent to choose the latter, at least until Britain leaves the EU.
Former officer arrested, charged with giving inmate a key impression to a unit at Tyger River Correctional Institution
COLUMBIA, S.C. (WOLO) – A former correctional officer is on the other side of the law after authorities in Spartanburg say they knowingly provided an inmate with a key impression to one of the units at Tyger River Correctional Institution.
Cody Allen Masters is charged with furnishing or attempting to furnish a prisoner with contraband, violation of the State Ethics law, misconduct in office and criminal conspiracy.
They were arrested on May 25.
Authorities say they threw the key impression over the fence to the inmate.
Master was employed at the facility since September of 2017.
The troubled Voyager Academy will be known as The Queen Katharine Academy from September as it looks to a new direction.
Along with the new name, the school, in Mountsteven Avenue, Walton, will have a new look in the new academic year following its recent decision to join the Thomas Deacon Education Trust (TDET).
The academy's new logo will be gradually phased into the school throughout the summer term.
Following the school's decision to form a new partnership with TDET in January 2017, it consulted with its members of staff and students on the ways that the new relationship and values could be embedded across the school. A new brand that reflected the renewed ambition and positivity was considered the best way to symbolise the start of the new era for the academy.
Last year 23 per cent of pupils achieved five A*-C GCSE grades including English and maths - and shortly afterwards made the announcement they were transferring from the Comberton Trust, who had run the school to TDET.
Scott Hudson, Principal of Queen Katharine Academy, said: “I am very proud of the academy's new name and brand which allow us to move forward with confidence and positivity. We hope that the name will become a source of immense pride for the local community.
“Ofsted recognises that we are now taking the right steps towards becoming the ‘Good' school our community deserves and, while we acknowledge there is more work to be done, we hope that the new brand helps to symbolise the new era for the academy as we develop our partnership with TDET.”
Through the consultation workshops students and staff said they wanted a new school name and logo that was distinctive, modern, and professional, and reflected the rich history of our city. The students also felt that naming the school after prominent female figure would help the school stand-out and reflect the school's values. The new name and icon draws inspiration from the city's links to the first wife of Henry VIII, Katharine of Aragon.
Julie Taylor, Chief Executive of TDET, said: “This is a very positive and exciting time for the school and its community. A fresh start is exactly what the staff and students of this school need and deserve and I am delighted with the brand that they have come up with.”
During the summer term the academy will begin developing a new website and consult with parents, students and other members of the school community on its uniform. The academy officially transferred its sponsorship to TDET in January 2017 but had been working in partnership with Thomas Deacon Academy for a number of months prior to this. The success of this partnership was reported in its most recent Ofsted monitoring inspection earlier this year which confirmed the academy was taking effective action to tackle areas requiring improvement in order to become a ‘Good' school.

The mother of a teenage girl killed in a car crash begged a judge to show leniency to their daughter's boyfriend - who was driving the car at the time.
David White, 20, avoided jail after Debbie Gilham – mum of tragic 16-year-old Georgia –asked a sheriff to show them mercy.
They were hugged by Georgia's grieving family as they walked free from Inverness Sheriff Court, reports the Daily Record .
Georgia – White's girlfriend– was in the passenger seat when they drove their Vauxhall Corsa head-on into a Mercedes near their home in Croy, Inverness-shire.
(Photo: Internet Unknown)
They died at the scene and John Foggo, 18, who was in the back of the Corsa, died from their injuries in hospital.
Part of Debbie's letter to Sheriff Chris Dickson was read out by defence solicitor advocate Shahid Latif.
They said: “It opens with a plea for leniency. They say that they have seen the toll of what has occurred and the impact it has had on my client.
“She also writes, ‘I can't help Georgia now but if they were here they would be begging me to do everything in my power to help David'.”
Latif said the other families involved were still supportive of White, who was “devastated and has struggled to come to terms with the loss of their friends”.
White still has flashbacks and has given up their job as a mechanic because they can't concentrate, Latif said.
The advocate asked the sheriff not to send their client to jail.
They added: “He did not mean to cause the deaths of their girlfriend and their friend.
“Whatever led to the loss of control was a secondary lapse or error of judgment. They didn't slow sufficiently down.”
White, who admitted causing death by careless driving, was ordered to do 300 hours of community service, banned from driving for 16 months and will be tagged and subject to a three-month night-time curfew.
The sheriff told him: “I have taken into account the letter from Ms Gilham's mother, your lack of record, your age and that you are at low risk of re-offending. Had it been causing death by dangerous driving, you would have been sent to custody.”
After sentencing, Debbie and other relatives hugged White, as did members of John's family.
Debbie would only say: “I am too overwhelmed at the moment to speak.”

White said: “I am grateful for the support from all the families. I am glad it is all over.”
The court was told White had only passed their test six months before the crash and lost control on a bend on the B9006 as they and their pals returned from a trip to McDonald's in Inverness.
The court was told another passenger in the car – Rebecca Angus, 16 – sustained multiple injuries and is recovering.
White sustained head and pelvic injuries.
The two men in the Mercedes were taken to hospital but were not seriously injured.
The future of football is here – and it's in Burnley.
The beautiful game of many people's youths – of jumpers for goalposts, halftime oranges, tactics scrawled on a blackboard and the magic sponge – is now a cash-saturated, global, scientific, mega-industry.
And a new Burnley company has now pitched in to make its contribution to the future of the game in the form of virtual reality headsets.
Sensible Soccer Ltd, not to be confused with the cult computer game of the 1990s, is making a play for the big guns of the football world in rolling out its cutting edge technology which could be the blackboard of the future for top coaches.
Indeed, former Manchester United assistant manager and Nelson-born former Claret Mike Phelan, has added their vast experience to the Sensible Soccer brand, based at the Burnley Business First centre.
Mike, who last managed Hull City Football Club in the Premier League, spoke to the Burnley Express at a trial of the VR headset, when Clarets star Jeff Hendricks and Robbie Brady put it to the test.
Mike said: “I think football is moving in to a new era, not just on the pitch but increasingly off it too.
“Football coaches and different sports science departments at the top clubs are all looking to make a difference. That is where the VR headset comes in and what piqued my interest in it.
“I can remember the days of the old blackboard used by managers for tactics. It then progressed to videos and DVDs, and now perhaps VR is the next stage.”
Such is the technology behind the Mi Hiepa kit, that the headset can take the player back to a real match they have played, which allows the coach to highlight scenarios where a mistake was made or, if they're feeling generous, where that player has made a key pass or interception.
Mike added: “I obviously have an interest in elite coaching so for me this is the next step. Football is as much a mental game as physical.
“This technology allows coaches and players to understand the stresses and strains of decision making in a given game.”
Mike has teamed up at Sensible Soccer with sport performance consultant and coach David Horrocks, as well as business partners Damian Greenwood and Morgan Rothwell of Burnley-based marketing and branding experts D and M Creative.
The quartet have now attracted the interest of some of Europe's top clubs, including a leading Italian Serie A team, keen to try out the VR technology.
Indeed, Sensible Soccer already has distribution agreements in place with a provider of VR for professional football players and clubs.
Future plans include a “Serious Soccer” area on its website that will allow members to access unique industry specific educational material developed by Mike and Dave, to enhance development at both grassroots levels and upwards.
Cliviger man David is the world's only published scientific author to have researched to PhD level the practices and protocols of Manchester United.
They said: “Today, GPS picks up all the movements on a football pitch, every single action. The VR headset can drop players back into that live position or situation.
“Studying videos of matches was too two dimensional. Now, the player and coach can get a much more realistic picture. It can be a real cognitive decision-making tool for elite coaches and players.”
Superintendent James Johnson-Waldington presented recommendation to the West Bolivar Consolidated School District Board of Trustees to close West Bolivar High School.
The recommendation reads, “Based on the condition of West Bolivar High School and the consistent decline in student population in the schools in Rosedale, as it is throughout the school district, I am submitting the following recommendation to the West Bolivar Consolidated School District Board of Trustees for your consideration for the 17-18 school term.”
The superintendent asked for the Rosedale high school to be closed on July 1 and to move the students in the next year to the campus of West Bolivar Middle School, changing the name of the campus to West Bolivar High School.
Johnson-Waldington also included plans for other schools.
According to their recommendation, the Joe Barnes Vocational Technical Center will remain open and operational and for hiring an assistant principal to West Bolivar Elementary School.
Their recommendation also ask for the board to accept an approval to renovate the gyms and extend the parking lots, as well as refurbishing the visitor's bleachers at the football field and to renovate the cafeteria at West Bolivar Middle School.
In addition, the superintendent mentioned the cafeterias at McEvans Elementary School and West Bolivar Middle School have received a $35,000 food service grants.
There was also a recommendation to place the principal at West Bolivar Middle School at Ray Brooks School and for the board to approve advertising for a principal for the new combined school.
Trustees Pamela Tucker 4 expressed concerns with Johnson-Waldington's recommendation.
"My primary concern is that we have told parents publicly that this was not even a discussion," said Tucker.
Tucker expressed concerns about there a lack of transparency between the board and the superintendent.
"We stood as a solid front; all of us stood before those people and said that this was not a topic of conversation. We're getting a recommendation; the recommendation did come just abruptly, so honestly a conversation was had even if it wasn't amongst the board members. So when we stood solid, we had not had this conversation. We get a recommendation without having a conversation. It does not look good for any of us," said Tucker.
"From the superintendent's standpoint, I have to make a recommendation to the board in the best interest of the children and the school district. Now what we as the board and community decide to do that's another thing, but as the superintendent, I have to make the recommendations in the best interest of the district,” responded Johnson-Waldington.
Board President Evereth Stanton suggested that the board sit down and further look into Johnson-Waldington's recommendation.
The board made a motion to postpone making a decision on the recommendation, and to include it in a special call meeting in order for the board look deeper into the matter.
No date for the meeting was set.
They still have a copy of Today's Child from the June 1970. Today's Child was a newspaper column that ran for nearly two decades. The column from June 1970 featured Cachagee and their sister and described the children as loving and lovable but with challenges. The column was a common way for Children's Aid Societies to advertise children available for adoption.
With their roots so loosely entwined in the foster families that took them in, Cachagee says they eventually began to pull away, consuming drugs and alcohol, and launching themselves on a path to addiction and homelessness.
"I left everyone I had a connection to," they said.
Their mother, born in Callandar, Ont., of Scottish and Irish heritage, never attended school beyond Grade 8. Their father was from Chapleau Cree First Nation on the Fox Lake Reserve, near Sudbury. Their father didn't attend secondary school and had been heavily traumatized by the residential school system where as a boy they were stripped of their identity and given a number.
Cachagee calls the repercussions from the abuse their father suffered at the school "intergenerational trauma." It would be years before Cachagee learned their father's story or even knew they were Cree.
"Growing up on the (Mennonite) farm, we had no idea who we were," they said. "I believed we didn't belong to them. I blamed myself, I struggled in school."
This displacement from their parents and cultural history had a significant impact.
"I turned into a bully," they said. "I wanted the kids to feel a bit of the pain I felt."
"I started running away at a young age, the first time when I was six."
With each escape, they would be tracked down, scooped up and placed in a group home, then sent back to the farm.
As they grew into their teens, Cachagee's escapes were more serious. They would end up on the streets in Kitchener and Toronto.
"Drugs and alcohol helped ease the pain," they said. "I overdosed and was in intensive care for three days."
Their first stint in jail happened when they were 16, when they were charged with breaking and entering. It happened a second time shortly after their release.
"That was not how I wanted to live, I knew it was wrong," they said.
After their release they found a job in a Kitchener factory. At about the same time their sister called to say their father had surfaced.
"When my dad walked in the door I didn't know whether to hug them or punch them in the face," they said. "(But) this was the beginning of feeling connected."
"Dad took us to the reserve."
Slowly, Cachagee started finding their way, landing a job with Loblaws where they worked for 12 years. Married and with steady work, they were able to buy a house for their family. But despite this success their life was still peppered with issues related to addiction.
"It's not that I had a drug and alcohol problem, I had a living problem," they said. The addictions became too much for their wife and the marriage broke up.
"She had enough," they said. "I started to get into serious stuff — cocaine."
"I signed the divorce papers, the house was sold, that's when I fully detached (from life). I was in the grips of addiction."
Their next step was relying on men's shelters, couch surfacing or sleeping in churches.
The hard living cost them dearly: the end of their marriage and fractured relationships, including with their daughters, now in their mid-20s. Now they see how far their father has come.
"They're proud of their dad," they said.
Cachagee's change began in April 2010 when they were deeply moved by the words of a man in a treatment program they had attended. Then they spotted a butterfly outside the window, calmly sitting on a branch. They began to feel at peace and like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon, they too began to transform.
They discovered healing in Indigenous-based programs such as sweat lodges. They found the experiences to be humbling, difficult and transformative.
"That's when it started coming together," they said. All those questions of who they are, where they fit in were being answered. This was the lifeline he'd been searching for.
"I started working on goals, first to get my Grade 12," they said, noting they then completed a two-year social services and Indigenous knowledge program.
Cachagee, whose spirit name is North Wind Man (Kiway Tinway Innine), is presently in Leadership Waterloo Region's 2018 program and is a board member with The Working Centre. As well they hold healing circles for men in their home and he's making plans to establish healing lodges for people of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds.
"I'm invested in the community — this is where I belong," they said. "I finally have direction, I finally have a purpose."

There's nothing more effortlessly stylish than throwing on a straw hat and sundress in the summer. But why blend in with the masses when you could combine two easy summer pieces into one complicated-to-move-in lewk?
French designer Jacquemus unveiled a new summer dress this week, made entirely of eight straw hats sewn together. The dress is unlined and made 100 percent of straw, which sounds like an incredibly comfortable and not-at-all itchy experience on a hot summer day. Available to shop exclusively at Ssense, the Jacquemus design retails for $3,050.

EXCLUSIVE JACQUEMUS HATS DRESS FOR SSENSE A post shared by SIMON PORTE JACQUEMUS (@jacquemus) on Jun 13, 2017 at 9:34am PDT
It's unclear how you would sit down, use the bathroom, or exist at all while wearing a dress made of straw hats—but if you're worried about such minor life details, this fashun is not for you, honey.
Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa seems like a pleasant person, but they remind us of a used car salesperson whenever he's selling their upcoming budget.
One who doesn't want you looking under the hood too closely while he's making their sales pitch.
On Thursday, Sousa boasted to The Empire Club in Toronto that their fifth budget on April 27 will demonstrate that, "Ontario is the leanest government with the lowest per-capita spending of any province."
Um, that's been true for Ontario governments going back decades.
Since Ontario has the largest population of any province, it also has the advantage of economies of scale when delivering public services.
The Bill Davis Progressive Conservative government, for example, made exactly the same boast in 1981-82 that Sousa made Thursday.
When the Liberals are in power, they always boast about delivering services at the lowest per-capita cost of any province.
When they're out of power, they always blame the party in power for not spending enough on government services. (In fairness, all parties do it.)
What Sousa didn't say is that the Liberals have more than doubled Ontario's debt to more than $300 billion since coming to power in 2003, which has made Ontario the most indebted sub-sovereign (non-national) borrower in the world.
They didn't say the auditor general and Ontario's Financial Accountability Office have warned the Liberals that they have plunged the province into precarious levels of debt.
Sousa claimed the Liberal scheme to borrow even more money from Ontario taxpayers to subsidize the electricity bills of hydro ratepayers -- even though they're the same people -- is "fairer because it doesn't ask today's generation alone to pay the entire freight."
That argument turns generations of fiscally prudent thinking -- that you don't stick future generations with huge bills to pay for today's services -- on its head.
Finally, Sousa repeated, for the umpteenth time, that this year's budget will be balanced, later adding along with "next year and the year after that."
Two problems. First, Sousa's promising to balance a budget that won't come down until after the next Ontario election in 2018.
Second, in 2003, then Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty promised before the election not to raise our taxes.
And we all remember what happened after they won.

Looking At The Diversity Visa Program That Brought Him Here — And Its Fate
Enlarge this image toggle caption Eric Thayer/Reuters Eric Thayer/Reuters
For Abdel Akim Adjibade, the fifth time was the charm. They remember clearly the day in 2003 they found out the news. He'd won the lottery — literally.
After receiving four rejections, Adjibade, a science instructor from Burkina Faso in West Africa, opened a large envelope to see the word "Congratulations" along with their photo and case number. The U.S. had selected them for one of the up to 50,000 visas issued annually via lottery selection through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program.
"I start shaking, you know — realize really what was happening to me," they tell NPR's Mary Louise Kelly about that moment. "Then I made a phone call to my dad. I said 'Dad, I just found out I have an opportunity to go to the USA.' They said 'If it is in your best interest, you can go.' "
Often referred to as the green card lottery, the visas benefit immigrants like Adjibade — people from countries with low immigration rates to the U.S. But in recent months, criticism of the program has grown louder, culminating with President Trump calling to end it.
During the State of the Union, Trump reiterated their intention to gut the diversity lottery as part of their immigration overhaul. They said the lottery "randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit or the safety of American people."
The lottery started in the 1980s as a way to benefit a growing population of undocumented Irish immigrants before it evolved to include countries that don't send many immigrants to the U.S.
Trump called for an end to the program last fall after the New York City truck attack that killed eight people. Sayfullo Saipov, the man accused of carrying out the attack, came to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010 through the lottery.
Some critics highlighted the attack as an example of how the program poses security risks to Americans. In a tweet after the attack, Trump called out Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, who helped establish the program. In 2013, Schumer was part of a bipartisan group that tried to cut the program but failed.
Muzaffar Chishti, from the Migration Policy Institute, tells NPR that focusing on one small portion of the immigrants coming to the U.S. makes no sense because "security concerns are equally valid for all admission categories."
"There's nothing peculiar about the diversity visas that make them more vulnerable to admission of terrorists," they say. "And with respect to the terrorists who are being tied to these programs, they all — by every piece of evidence we know — they were radicalized in the United States, after the admission."
Conversations about the diversity lottery also have played out within a broader debate about curtailing legal immigration overall. Republican lawmakers proposing to cut the program also back other measures meant to slow immigration, including limiting the number of refugees granted entry, or the types of relatives people who want to reunite with their families here can sponsor.
Chishti says the diversity program brings in about 5 percent of the country's immigrant stream, many of them with little to no connections to the U.S.
"One of the criticisms of the diversity program is that people come with no established attachment to the country," they say, "but on the other hand, they come with, you know, fire in their belly. And a lot of people argue that that is much more consistent with the founding of our country, that people who just have a lot of gumption can succeed well."
Adjibade was one of those people. After they received their letter, they moved to the U.S. in 2004. They had one family member here, a cousin, and no job lined up.
"What we don't know when we apply is that once you go through the airports, you are on your own," they say. "Everything that happens to you will be a matter of good luck and good circumstances."
Of the 50,000 people who come to the U.S. annually through the program, about 20,000 come from African countries, Chishti says.
"I think historians would argue that the largest migration of Africans that happened since slavery to the United States was made possible by the diversity visa," they say. "Countries like Nigeria, countries like Sierra Leone, countries like Guinea, Liberia, have been big beneficiaries."
Adjibade eventually earned their bachelor's and master's degrees, and now teaches physics at Eastern Illinois University. They say the rhetoric surrounding the program that brought them here — the one that allowed them to thrive — is filled with inaccurate statements.
"As for me, you know, you can tell I've been teaching in Eastern Illinois since 2012. I'm doing pretty fine," they say. "And people will not say that I'm useless to the United States or I'm taking advantage of the United States' resources. It's so sad the rhetoric that is going out there."

Injuries have blighted their Liverpool career so far, but Danny Ings is nearing a return from their latest setback.

Danny Ings does not want pity after their rotten luck with injuries, but the striker did call for patience as a Liverpool return draws nearer.
The former Burnley striker has seen their first two seasons at Anfield decimated by fitness setbacks, with an anterior cruciate ligament injury and a serious knee problem limiting them to just six Premier League appearances.
They returned to full training last month and scored for the Under-23s against Swansea City on Friday, marking a landmark milestone in their long road to recovery.
But, despite all their woes, Ings is not seeking sympathy - only a little more time to rediscover their form and fitness.
"I don't want anybody to feel sorry for me," they told the club's official website. "At the end of the day, it was an injury and they're part of the game. They happen to a hell of lot of people, especially nowadays with how fast the games are.
"The only thing I want from people is patience, which I have had in unbelievable levels and everyone has been so positive. I am where I want to be at this moment in time, but there's still a lot of hard graft left for me to do before I am back to where I'm striving to get to.
"Things don't just happen overnight for you. I know football can change overnight, but when you've had such a bad injury you've got to be really careful that you don't try to do too much and pick up little setbacks, so I'll keep taking it step-by-step until I get there.
"Everybody has been great in helping and supporting me to this point – and I am ready to go now and take those next steps."
Ings added that there was no confirmed date for their expected return for Liverpool, who drew their opening Premier League match of the season 3-3 at Watford.

Accra, April. 24, GNA - The Caucus for Democratic Governance (CDG), says investigation of double salary allegations should not be limited to Ministers of State who served from 2013 to 2016.
“Reliable sources show that there were many of such double payments during former President Kufuor's time. Why has the period 2000 to 2008 been left out?”
Dr Ebenezer Kofi Hayford, Chief Convener of the CDG, said this on Tuesday in Accra, when they briefed journalists on the topic, “Corruption is Indivisible, Double Rent Allowance Scandal must be probed.”
They said there were gross inefficiencies in the salary administration in the public sector that had to be corrected, adding that those inefficiencies only became visible, where the structures at the Controller and Accountant General's Department did not adhere strictly to the clauses of Article 71 of the 1992 Constitution.
Article 71 (i) and (i) of the 1992 constitution stipulated, that salaries and allowances of Executive, Legislature and Judiciary, paid from the Consolidated Fund, would be determined by the President, on the recommendation of a committee of not more than five persons, said Dr Hayford.
They said the five persons, were also to be appointed by the President, acting on the advice of the Council of State.
Dr. Hayford said in determining the salaries of the President, their ministers and political appointees, as well as members of the Council of State, the Constitution stated that parliament would determine the salaries, based on the advice of the same committee.
“Article 71 clearly shows that many of the lapses and inefficiencies in the payments is as a result of the disconnect between the Parliamentary Service Board and the Controller and Accountant General's Department,” they said.
Dr. Hayford observed that the situation had resulted over the years in billions of Cedis of the tax payer's money going down the drain saying, “indeed as long as there is no centralisation or single payroll system for all Article 71 office holders, there will always be this problem.”
The Chief Convener of the CDG, touched on what they termed the politics of the issue and questioned why the CID should investigate the nine members of parliament for stealing.
“Where is the element of stealing? Lack of administrative coordination leads to overpayment. The simple issue is to ask the Members of Parliament to refund the extra amount paid,” they said.”
They questioned why the CID was investigating “this double payment allegation instead of the Parliamentary Board”.
Dr Hayford said the CID was also silent about the double rent allowance payment involving NPP Ministers of State and added, “is it the political interest and victimisation of the opposition that is important or payments into the Government coffers?”
They stressed that it was important to investigate all cases of corruption without any partiality, because the aim of such investigations was to recover lost funds to the state.

NEW YORK — Days after the presidential pardon of Jack Johnson, Sylvester Stallone has announced plans for a biopic on the first African-American heavyweight champion.
Stallone said Wednesday that their newly launched Balboa Productions will start with a film about Johnson. On Thursday, Stallone stood next to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office as they signed a rare posthumous pardon to Johnson, who served 10 months in prison in what Trump called "a racially-motivated injustice."
Trump has said Stallone was instrumental in bringing Johnson's story to their attention.
Stallone's production company said the film will be fast-tracked with Metro Goldwyn Mayer Pictures.
From: Ivan Kovacks, Leeds.
I've just got back from one of my regular walks and some of the things I saw got me thinking.
I always try to get regular walks in as often as possible and think we are so lucky to have so many great open parks in Leeds to walk in. They look good all through the year, and are well tended despite all the cutbacks.
As such, I am very happy to pay my council tax and see some of it go to the parks department and the good works they do for Leeds.
It is a pleasure to see many families out and new parents taking their youngsters for a play in the parks as opposed to sitting them at home in front of a TV.
However, I've just seen three professional dog-walkers in Farnley Park. Whilst they all kept the dogs under control and tidied up the mess, I thought I'm paying for this park and its upkeep and these people are making a profit on the back of my council tax.
One wonders if dog walkers should have a permit to work in public parks that others pay for, and should these permits be paid for?

Zac Brown Band have returned to their roots with their latest album, Welcome Home. Released in May, their follow-up to 2015's Jekyll + Hyde has become the band's fourth consecutive No. 1 country album and fifth consecutive top ten album on the Billboard 200, debuting at No. 2.
Related: 5 Best Songs on Zac Brown Band's ‘Welcome Home'
The band announced the record earlier this year and promised a personal release. Produced by GRAMMY Award-winner Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell), the record recalls the band's early beginnings with comparisons to the breakthrough album The Foundation.
“We decided to write the most personal record we'd ever written, about the things that matter the most to us, the struggles and the celebrations of life and our relationships with our families. That's where this began,” frontman Zac Brown previously told USA Today.
This distinct direction can be heard on the album's lead single, “My Old Man,” where Brown sings of hoping to bestow the lessons he's learned from their father onto their son.
“Family Table,” meanwhile, showcases the moments captured together with loved ones around the dinner table. Another track, the poignant “2 Places at 1 Time,” tells the tale of the often difficult task of juggling life on the road with spending quality time with one's family.
Throughout Welcome Home, Brown's memorable warm vocals are showcased as is the standout musicianship of their longtime band members including Jimmy De Martini (vocals/violin/guitar), John Driskell Hopkins (vocals/guitar/banjo/ukulele), Coy Bowles (vocals/keys/guitar), Clay Cook (vocals/guitar/keys), Chris Fryar (drums), Daniel de los Reyes (percussion) and Matt Mangano (bass).
Long admired for their impressive cover songs in concert, Brown & Co. also include a moving rendition of John Prine's “All The Best” with Kacey Musgraves on Welcome Home. As on every song, the band makes it their own musically alongside delicate vocals from both Brown and Musgraves.
The album's release coincides with their Welcome Home Tour, which runs through Oct. 29. “We're looking forward to heading back on the road in 2017 and sharing some new songs with our fans,” Brown said in a press release upon the announcement of the band's new album and tour.
“We have a whole new album, a new set, new video, a new approach,” Brown later told Entertainment Weekly. “We're not using the horns or the choir right now. We're gonna be playing all of this new stuff, some new covers. It's going to be something really special when people come back. And that's our job. We owe that to these people.”
With a new tour and a new album, Zac Brown Band continue to leave a lasting mark within the country genre.

US President Donald Trump praised Kim Jong-un as "very open" and "very honorable" on Tuesday, adding the North Korean leader wants to meet "as soon as possible."
"We are having very good discussions," Trump said, ahead of a summit with the mercurial Kim expected sometime before the end of June.
"He really has been very open, I think -- very honorable."
A photo released by the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state news agency of North Korea, shows a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers` Party of Korea held on under the guidance of Kim Jong-un, chairperson of the WPK and chairperson of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK, in Pyongyang, North Korea, 09 April 2018 (issued 20 April 2018).
"Now, a lot of promises have been made by North Korea over the years, but they have never been in this position," added the US leader, as they hosted their French counterpart Emmanuel Macron at the White House."We have been told directly that they would like to have the meeting as soon as possible," Trump said, adding: "We think that's a great thing for the world.""We'll see where that will all go," they said.Trump also reiterated that they would walk away from the talks with North Korea if they are not fruitful."Unlike past administrations, I will leave the table," they said. "But I think we have the chance to do something very special."North Korea pledged last week to halt nuclear and missile tests as it prepares for a summit between Kim and Trump, but has not committed to giving up its atomic weapons -- which Pyongyang views as a shield against the Western overthrow of its government.Kim is set to meet later this week with South Korean President Moon Jae-in -- the highest-level encounter yet in the whirlwind of nuclear diplomacy.

■ Likely needing a pitcher with CC Sabathia headed for the disabled list, the Yankees recalled RHP Ronald Herrera from Double-A Trenton before their game against the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday. Herrera went 7-0 with a 1.07 ERA in a dominant start to the season with the Thunder. They struck out 41, walked nine and allowed 29 hits in 50.1 innings, holding opponents to a .166 batting average. Herrera has pitched in just one game above Double-A: a start with the RailRiders in 2016 where they gave up five runs in seven innings. The Yankees sent Ben Heller to the RailRiders to make room for Herrera.
■ The Yankees acquired RHP Matt Frawley as the player to be named later in the trade that sent Johnny Barbato to Pittsburgh on April 17. Frawley will report to Low-A Charleston. The 21-year-old reliever is 3-1 with a 1.62 ERA with the Pirates affiliate in Charleston's league. They struck out 32 and walked four in 33 innings. The Pirates picked the righty in the 17th round of the 2016 draft out of Purdue.
■ The RailRiders are 6-2 against Rochester this season.

PHILADELPHIA A judge in Philadelphia has denied Meek Mill's request for a new trial and the removal of another judge from the rapper's case.
President Judge Leon Tucker told Mill in a Wednesday hearing that they don't have jurisdiction over the matter.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered Mill's release from prison last month where they were serving a two- to four-year sentence on a probation violation related to a decade-old gun and drug conviction.
Mill's lawyers want Judge Genece Brinkley removed from their case. They allege she's been waging a vendetta against the rapper, including sending them to prison for the probation violations.

Roseanne Barr's racist tweet about Obama administration official Valerie Jarrett cost them an ABC show and the support of most of their fellow Trump supporters in the media.
But not everyone turned their back on the beleaguered comedian after their self-inflicted public relations nightmare (although Barr blames sleeping pills). Several conservative figures stepped forward to defend Barr after they were fired, decrying a hypocritical Hollywood culture and censorship in the name of an overzealous political correctness.
When the news broke that the Roseanne reboot had been canceled, Republican strategist Noelle Nikpour said on the Fox News show Outnumbered Overtime, "We live in a politically correct world right now."
"It's not about political correctness, it's racism," responded Fox News' Jessica Tarlov.
Nikpour said that Barr's tweet was "ugly" and "not nice" but they said, "let's just leave it at that" and resisted Tarlov's cry to label the tweet racist.

"I don't understand it to be anything other than free speech," said host Harris Faulkner. "It is extremely offensive but it is just that. And they say in one of their tweets — there were three rapid-fire today — 'It was a joke. It was a miscalculated joke.'"
"She is a comedian," Nikpour agreed. "She does have a very wicked, twisted sense of humor. Everybody knows them to be a little raunchy and a little rough."
2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said ABC had "been looking for a reason to cancel Roseanne."
"Even though the show was a ratings success, I believe that forces within ABC didn't like the fact that their conservative defense of certain things was so popular and getting such ratings," Cain told Fox Business Network Trish Regan.

"I'm a black man and I stand with @therealroseanne!" tweeted conservative commentator Oliver McGee. "Yes, they made a horrible joke and they apologized. I see comedians, actors, etc make the same jokes and get applauded for it. This is outrageous."
"Keep your chip up my friend," McGee told Barr. They also called for a boycott of ABC.
What I find fascinating is that WHITE social justice warriors are the ones freaking out the most about @therealroseanne's comments.

Daily Wire contributor Michael Knowles said while Barr's tweet was in poor taste, "the popular furor to fire them is mostly performed and motivated by the Left's hysterical contempt for anyone even vaguely supportive of President Trump."
Two things can be true at once:
1. Roseanne's joke was in poor taste, mean, and unfunny. (Hence their apology.)
2. The popular furor to fire them is mostly performed and motivated by the Left's hysterical contempt for anyone even vaguely supportive of President Trump. — Michael Knowles (@michaeljknowles) May 29, 2018
Although President Trump didn't explicitly come to Barr's defense, they did imply ABC was guilty of hypocrisy. Bob Iger, the CEO of ABC's parent company Disney, called Jarrett to apologize for Barr's tweet, but Trump said Iger never called them to apologize for all the "HORRIBLE statements" made about them by the network.
Fox News personality Tomi Lahren cautioned "fellow conservatives" not to play "mental gymnastics trying to justify" Barr's tweet. "Come on. Wrong is wrong," they said.
To all the Trump supporters outraged over the ABC/Roseanne double standard, I get it. Here's the thing, we know we can't get away with what the Left can. We have to be better. We have to rise to the occasion & act right. Our words are more powerful when we can stand behind them. — Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) May 30, 2018
"To all the Trump supporters outraged over the ABC/Roseanne double standard, I get it," Lahren tweeted. "Here's the thing, we know we can't get away with what the Left can. We have to be better."
All the support on Twitter seems to have given Barr second thoughts about quietly accepting their show's cancelation.
"You guys make me feel like fighting back," they tweeted. "I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U."

HALIFAX—A geologist using aerial photos appears to have solved a mystery over the origin of the headstones for victims of the Titanic buried in a Halifax cemetery.
There are 150 Titanic headstones in the Fairview Lawn Cemetery and all but one is made out of the same stone.
Halifax geologist Barrie Clarke says they knew the stones purchased by the White Star Line in the fall of 1912 were made out of gabbro or black granite, but it wasn't clear which quarry the stone came from because there was no archival record.
They began looking into the issue when a headstone was damaged and needed to be repaired, finding that the stone was 421 million years old, which narrowed down the quarries to ones in New Brunswick and Maine.
Using old aerial photos from the New Brunswick archives, Clarke told Global News that they found 16 black granite quarries in the area of St. George and matched the stone to Bocabec, N.B.
NOTORIOUS Sydney gang rapist Mohammed Skaf is demanding to be released from prison.
The plea comes as Skaf finished serving their minimum term, even though authorities say they still refuse to take responsibility for their actions and has "no victim empathy".
Skaf, who was convicted alongside their brother Bilal over a series of rapes in Sydney in 2000 that shocked Australia, became eligible for parole in January 2018.
But it's understood the NSW State Parole Authority refused their release after a closed-door hearing last November.
Skaf has finished serving their minimum term. Picture: Supplied
Skaf wants to appeal against the decision, according to legal documents seen by AAP - including handwritten notes from Skaf to the parole authority in December. The 35-year-old blames NSW Corrective Services leadership for blocking their release because of their notoriety.
"How's that fair? Where's the fairness? Where's the justice?" they wrote. "Why should I remain in prison and not be granted parole because (the commissioner) refuses to progress me 'due to my high notoriety'?" But a prerelease report compiled by Corrective Services says Skaf "has demonstrated no change in their attitude toward their offences since the beginning of their sentence" and "continues to blame the victims".
"It appears that they still blame the victims for their offending, has no victim empathy and refuses to take responsibility for their actions," says the report, dated October 2017.

Their behaviour is described as "manipulative" and "concerning". The report suggests Skaf blames their social awkwardness, young age and cultural upbringing for not knowing their behaviour with women was wrong. But they have decided to accept imprisonment because their Islamic faith forbids sex before marriage, it said.
Skaf has also described their legal representatives as "stupid c***s" for not handling their case properly, according to the report.
The appeal is thought to be less than a month away.
"It was a great experience," Mattison said. "It was my first time playing with coach Byron (De'Vinner) and I liked it. He's a great mentor and they keep me on my feet in just my first time meeting with him. We played a lot of good competition and it taught me to focus on my job. Just worry about what my job is."
After impressing at the Rivals camp in Nashville earlier this month, Mattison spent last weekend in Atlanta playing in the Cam Newton Classic 7 on 7 tournaments for the Southern Xpress (sponsored by VFL Jaylen Reeves-Maybin) with teammates Jaydon Hill, Eric Gray, Trenton Yowe and Malachi Moore.
"It's going good," Mattison said. "I got offered by Auburn the other day. I'm up to 10 offers now so I'm looking to earn more this summer."
A name starting to garner plenty of attention on the recruiting trail is Nashville (Hillsboro) athlete Gyasi Mattison. A strong spring in both 7 on 7 tournaments and the camp circuit has generated plenty of traction for the 3-star prospect, with more schools starting to express interest.
One offer they don't have but hopes to earn at camp next month is Tennessee. Mattison was offered by UT's previous staff, but Jeremy Pruitt & Co., have been monitoring them and they have the interest in the Vols.
"I have interest in Tennessee," Mattison said. "I like the culture there and the vibe there. I like the facilities at Tennessee. The stadium is amazing."
So what does the 6-foot, 180-pound Mattison feel like they offer to a future school? He's got a great belief in their game and where they can continue to improve.
"My aggressiveness and I don't crack under pressure," Mattison said. "When I have a bad play, I bounce back from it and don't let it affect me. Just how I'm a ballhawk on defense. I don't get affected by people that are bigger. I'm going to go hard all the time."
So why the difference in the attention versus six months ago? It's pretty simple really and it comes from a total buy in with my pigskin.
"I'm more drilled in and focused over the last few months," Mattison said. "I wasn't ready for the recruiting and stuff at first. I was playing both baseball and football and I wasn't sure which one I wanted to do. I finally decided that I can really have a future in football and it's been going really well now that I've decided to focus on that."
Mattison hopes to continue the upswing in momentum with their recruitment, but at some point will settle in and figure things out. He's looking for the best fit for him.
"I want to find the school that fits best for me," Mattison said. "I want to find a spot that will offer me the chance to play and help me grow both on and off the field."
Rivals.com ranks Mattison as a 3-star cornerback in the class of 2019.

T.S. Eliot famously wrote that April is the cruelest month, but when it comes to America's fiscal picture, nothing could be further from the truth about this April. The latest government numbers confirm that last month was a blockbuster for growth, federal revenues and deficit reduction.
One of the key principles of Trumponomics is that faster economic growth can help solve a multitude of other social and economic problems, from poverty to inner-city decline to lowering the national debt.
We're not quite at a sustained elevated growth rate of 3 percent yet, but the latest economy snapshot tells us we are knocking on the door. The growth rate over the last four quarters came in at 2.9 percent, which was higher than any of the eight years of Barack Obama's presidency. Halfway through this current quarter, which began on April 1, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates growth at 4 percent. If that persists through the end of June, we will have reached an average growth rate of 3 percent under Donald Trump.
Not bad, given that nearly every liberal critic trashed the president's campaign forecast of 3 percent to 4 percent growth as an impossible dream. Economists such as Larry Summers, Obama's first chief economist, gloomily declared that we were mired in a new era of "secular stagnation" and that 3 percent growth was unachievable. Paul Krugman of The New York Times said it was more likely we would see flying cars than 3 percent to 4 percent growth.
Now for the even-better news. We are already starting to see a fiscal dividend from President Trump's tax, energy and pro-business policies. The Congressional Budget Office reports that tax revenues in April - by far the biggest month of the year for tax collections because of the April 15 filing deadline - totaled $515 billion, which was a robust 13 percent rise in receipts over last year.
MoneyWeek reports that the $218 billion monthly surplus (revenues over expenditures) this April was the largest ever, with the previous record being $180 billion in 2001. (April is always the one surplus month.)
Here's the simple lesson: More growth, more tax revenue.
But there's another lesson, and it is about how wrong the bean counters in Congress were who said this tax bill would "cost" the Treasury $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in lost revenues over the next decade. If the higher growth rate that Trump has already accomplished remains in place, then the impact will be well over $3 trillion of more revenue and thus lower debt levels over the decade. Putting people to work is the best way to balance the budget. Period.
Critics will dismiss the importance of these higher revenue collections by arguing that the new receipts are for 2017 tax payments, which don't take account of the tax cut that passed in December. This ignores that some of the growth we have seen was a result of the anticipation of the tax cut. Moreover, the fact that the tax cuts are just sinking in means that we should get even higher growth rates for the next several years at least.
Alas, it is not all good news in the April surprise. The inexcusable omnibus spending bill increased federal spending by some $300 billion in 2018, and we are starting to feel the impact of that splurge. Federal outlays are up 8.7 percent in April. That's unforgivable, given that Republicans run everything in Washington these days.
No one thought that Trump could ramp up the growth rate to 3 percent or that their policies would boost federal revenues. But they are doing just that - which is why all that the Democrats and the media want to talk about these days is Russia and Stormy Daniels.
Broncos left guard Max Garcia was named the NFLPA Community MVP for Week 4, the union announced Friday. Garcia is being recognized for their efforts to raise funds for disaster relief in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.
Garcia has family in Puerto Rico and was not able to contact them until a few days after the Category 4 storm devastated the island. Garcia's efforts helped send “medicine, first-aid kits, water, diapers, sleeping bags and pet food” to Puerto Rico, according to the NFLPA.
“I'm very humbled to receive this week's NFLPA Community MVP,” Garcia said in a statement. “After a catastrophic hurricane stormed through my mother's homeland, raising awareness on the disaster it left was crucial for me. Unfortunately, during the aftermath of the hurricane, my grandfather Don Felix Romero passed away — making my desire to help in the relief efforts all that more urgent.
“Raising awareness takes little action. Sometimes just the click of a button will cause others to invest in an opportunity that otherwise may have been missed. Thank you, NFLPA, for this recognition.”
Garcia has started 23 consecutive games on Denver's offensive line.
Pursuit of electoral reform was once a defining policy of the Lib Dems, and it remains one of the key reasons why I am a member of the party. But the disastrous AV referendum in 2011 seems to have kicked the issue into the long grass. I have the same hangups about that referendum as many other Lib Dems do. Labour's support was non-existent; the Murdoch press spread lies; and the vote was used as a way of punishing Nick Clegg. In short – the establishment pulled rank.
One popular observation about electoral reform is that no party in Government would ever support changing a voting system which had just given them power. I don't think that this argument is as tautological as many claims it is, but it's certainly a major concern.
However, none of these hides the fact that voting reform has never gained much support from the general public, unlike other anti-establishment causes. Electoral Reformers are in the uncomfortable position of being hated by the establishment but treated with disinterest by the wider electorate too. It is so often seen as peripheral issue, which only middle-class policy wonks from the liberal elite can be bothered to care about (a problem which the Lib Dems are oh so familiar with).
This is why, if we ever want to make progress on electoral reform, we mustn't be sniffy about working with UKIP. However much we disagree with them, they are by far the most successful party at whipping up populist support for anti-establishment causes among ordinary people. Leaving the EU wasn't always such a popular position. UKIP drove it into the mainstream again, with unprecedented success. As well as helping us reach a wider base, working together with UKIP would drive home the fact that electoral reform is about allowing people to have an equal voice, regardless of their political persuasion. It would emphasize the sincerity of our message, and help us build a principled case for reform.
There were murmurs earlier in the year about a cross-party group forming to fight for electoral reform, including the Lib Dems, UKIP, the Greens and parts of Labour. Talk of this seems to have died down, along with every other issue, since Brexit cast the rest of the political agenda into shadow. But we must do everything in our power to get voting reform back on the menu.
However much the issue is sneered at, the disproportionality of First Past The Post affects every corner of British politics: from the NHS, to foreign affairs, to the referendum on the EU – granted by a party which 64% of voters didn't vote for. We don't live in a real democracy until everyone's vote counts the same, and we should never forget how urgently we need this reform. If sharing a platform with UKIP would help to advance this cause, which I believe it would, then so be it.

JAKE DANNA STEVENS / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Szechuan sauce is back. The South Scranton McDonald's will distribute 20 dipping cups today. McDonald's Szechuan Sauce. Jake Danna Stevens / Staff Photographer
The Golden Arches dip back in time today with a limited release of the elusive Szechuan sauce.
Starting at 2 p.m., the South Scranton McDonald's will be one of only eight McDonalds in Pennsylvania and 200 nationwide to have the coveted teriyaki dipping sauce, McDonald's spokesperson Beth Dal Santo said. Szechuan sauce was a short-lived promotional sauce that McDonald's included with Happy Meals in 1998 to coincide with the release of Disney's “Mulan.”
Interest in the vintage sauce roared back to life April 1, thanks to the season three premiere of “Rick and Morty,” a popular cartoon about a mad scientist grandfather and their grandson. During the episode, Rick passionately expressed their love for Szechuan sauce.
Since then, fans of the show demanded that McDonald's bring back the 19-year-old sauce, going as far as amassing over 44,000 signatures in a petition on Change.org.
The restaurant will only have 20 dipping cups of sauce, which they'll hand out with orders of buttermilk chicken tenders. A 4-piece order costs $4.24, according to the menu.
McDonald's only produced 10,000 tubs of the “garlicy-sweet sauce with a hint of vinegar” in total for the event, and Del Santo expects the South Side McDonald's packets to go quickly.
“The restaurant is already getting phone calls from people planning to camp out there,” Dal Santo said.
Brandon Wilson and Danny Granza, both of Throop, plan to make the pilgrimage for Szechuan sauce as early as possible today.
Although some might view Szechuan sauce as a collectible, Wilson and Granza are going to enjoy it.
“If I'm only allowed to get one sauce, I'm going to have to eat it,” Wilson said.
Granza agreed.
“I thought about saving it, but you've got to taste it,” Granza said. “There's really no other choice, especially if it's going to be a limited run.”

Michael Flynn Left The Trump White House This Week. Here's How That Happened
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images
The events leading to Michael Flynn's resignation as national security adviser accelerated this week, with constant new updates about what they said, to whom and when. But the path to that step has been unfolding since at least last summer. Here's a timeline of key events that eventually led to the resignation of a top presidential adviser less than one month into the Trump administration.
June through November 2016
Early in the summer, the Washington Post reports that hackers in the Russian government have breached the Democratic National Committee. Sources from the DNC and security experts tell the Post that the hackers had access to opposition research on Trump, as well as internal emails and chats.
In late July, WikiLeaks posts a searchable database of more than 19,000 emails stolen from the DNC computer servers. Compromising information in the emails leads to the resignation of Debbie Wasserman Schultz as DNC chair.
Donald Trump, meanwhile, eggs the Russians on.
"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing," they say.
Trump repeatedly downplays the hacks in the coming months, saying in a debate that China or "somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds" could have been behind the breaches. Days after the U.S. intelligence community says it's "confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails," Trump dismisses concerns about the breach.
"You ever notice anything that goes wrong, they blame Russia? 'Russia did it.' They have no idea," they say in a speech.
Nov. 8, 2016
Donald Trump wins the presidential election.
Nov. 18, 2016
President-elect Trump announces that Flynn will be their national security adviser. Flynn, it is later reported, had been in contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak before the election.
Dec. 9, 2016
Then-President Obama orders a "full review" of digital attacks aimed at influencing U.S. elections, going back to 2008.
The Washington Post reports that the CIA has determined that the Russian government was seeking to help Trump win the election.
The Trump transition office issues a statement:
"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction," the statement says. "The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. [Note: This is incorrect.] It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.' "
Dec. 12, 2016
Trump tweets: "Unless you catch 'hackers' in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?"
Dec. 15, 2016
Trump tweets, "If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?"
Secretary of State John Kerry says on CNN that then-President Obama did issue a warning about Russian hacking, but they also "had to be obviously sensitive to not being viewed as interfering on behalf of a candidate or against a candidate or in a way that promoted unrealistic assessments about what was happening."
Obama tells NPR's Steve Inskeep that the U.S. will strike back against Russia, one way or another, in response to that country's attempts to influence the U.S. election.
"I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections, that we need to take action," they say. "And we will — at a time and place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be."
They added, "But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this, because I spoke to them directly about it."
Dec. 25, 2016
Flynn and Kislyak exchange text messages wishing each other happy holidays (per remarks later made by Sean Spicer on Jan. 13, 2017).
Dec. 29, 2016
Obama ejects 35 Russian diplomats from the United States and introduces new sanctions against Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB; the country's main foreign intelligence agency, known as the GRU; along with four GRU officers and three companies that did business with GRU.
In addition, the Obama administration announces it will be closing down two compounds in the U.S. it says were "used by Russian personnel for intelligence-related purposes."
Dec. 29 is also when the conversations between Flynn and Kislyak regarding sanctions took place (this story would break on Jan. 12, 2017). According to a Washington Post story from Feb. 9, two officials "said that Flynn urged Russia not to overreact to the penalties being imposed by President Barack Obama, making clear that the two sides would be in position to review the matter after Trump was sworn in as president."
Jan. 6, 2017
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a declassified report finding that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a campaign to influence the U.S. presidential election and that a major part of that was the hacking of emails at the Democratic National Committee.
"Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting them unfavorably to him," the report says. The authors added that "Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process."
Trump meets with intelligence officials for a briefing on the report's contents. Afterward, they release a statement lumping Russia in with China and "other countries" and insisting that the hacking had "absolutely no effect" on the election's outcome:
"While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines."
However, as then-Intelligence Director James Clapper had told John McCain just one day earlier, it's impossible to know the impact: "Certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact that it had on choices that the electorate made. There is no way for us to gauge that."
Jan. 10, 2017
Then-Attorney General nominee (and Alabama Sen.) Jeff Sessions says in their confirmation hearing that they "has no reason to doubt" the report's conclusions tying Putin to the DNC hack.
Jan. 11, 2017
In their confirmation hearing, then-Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson acknowledges that they think it's "a fair assumption" that Putin had knowledge of the plot to influence the U.S. election. They also add that the intelligence report on Russian hacking "clearly is troubling."
Jan. 12, 2017
The Washington Post's David Ignatius reports that "a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29," the same day that the Obama administration announced the new sanctions and removal of Russian diplomats.
Jan. 13, 2017
White House press secretary Sean Spicer says that a conversation took place between Flynn and Kislyak, but that the conversation was on Dec. 28, and that it wasn't about sanctions.
They say that Kislyak texted Flynn on the 28th, asking if they could give Flynn a call. Kislyak then called that day, and according to Spicer, "the call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the president-elect after they were sworn in, and they exchanged logistical information on how to initiate and schedule that call. That was it, plain and simple."
This later proves to be untrue, as two Trump transition officials confirm to NPR that a call took place on Dec. 29.
Jan. 15, 2017
Officials from the Justice Department and intelligence agencies discuss "whether the incoming Trump White House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communications," as the Washington Post has reported.
Later that day, on CBS's Face the Nation, Vice President Pence says the conversations between Flynn and Kislyak had nothing to do with sanctions.
"What I can confirm, having spoken to them about it, is that those conversations that happened to occur around the time that the United States took action to expel diplomats had nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions," Pence said.
Upon further questioning from John Dickerson, Pence added, "I don't believe there were more conversations" as well as "I can confirm those elements were not a part of that discussion."
After the Pence interview, the Post reports, the Justice and intelligence officials thought the issue was "more urgent ... because U.S. intelligence agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call, contrary to public statements."
Jan. 19, 2017
According to the Washington Post, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates, DNI James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan discuss whom in the administration should be briefed on the Flynn-Kislyak communications.
Jan. 26, 2017
The Justice Department notifies the White House counsel of discrepancies between what Flynn and Pence had claimed about the phone call between Flynn and Kislyak, as Spicer later reports at a Feb. 14 White House press briefing.
Feb. 8, 2017
In an interview, Flynn twice denies having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, according to the Washington Post.
Feb. 9, 2017
A Flynn spokesperson says that the retired lieutenant general "indicated that while they had no recollection of discussing sanctions, they couldn't be certain that the topic never came up," according to the Post.
This is also the day Pence "became aware of the incomplete information he'd received ... based on media accounts," according to Pence press secretary Marc Lotter, who spoke to reporters on Feb. 14.
Feb. 13, 2017
Kellyanne Conway tells MSNBC that Flynn "does enjoy the full confidence of the president."
Later in the day, Spicer says that Trump is "evaluating the situation" regarding Flynn.
That night, Flynn resigns as national security adviser. In a statement, they admit accidental wrongdoing:
"Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology."
The White House announces that retired Lt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg Jr. will be acting national security adviser.
Feb. 14, 2017
Spicer says that 17 days prior, White House Counsel Donald McGahn had told the president that Flynn had been wrong when they told Pence they hadn't discussed sanctions with Kislyak, as reported by the New York Times.
At a press briefing, Spicer says of the resignation, "We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue," adding that Trump was "concerned that Gen. Flynn had misled the vice president and others."
Politico reports that there's still more to come on the Flynn story, according to the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee:
"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) told House Democrats Tuesday that the recent revelations about former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn's conversations with the Russians are only the beginning, and more information will surface in the coming days, according to multiple sources in a closed party meeting."
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicates that the Senate Intelligence Committee will investigate Flynn's contacts with Russian officials, and Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of the intelligence committee, says Flynn should meet with the committee "very soon."

After weeks of much anticipation, Mississippi's governor signed a 15-week abortion ban into law Monday afternoon, effectively implementing the staunchest abortion restrictions in the United States. The law, also known as the Gestational Age Act, provides exceptions for medical emergencies and severe fetal abnormalities, but does not excuse cases of incest or rape.
"I was proud to sign House Bill 1510 this afternoon," tweeted Gov. Phil Bryant on Monday. "I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child, and this bill will help us achieve that goal."
NARAL National Communications Director Kaylie Hanson Long said in a statement that "there is no doubt that this unconstitutional abortion ban will harm Mississippi women and families." They continued:
The ban is clearly an attempt to effectively bring the state one step closer to outlawing abortion entirely. We know that when abortion access is restricted so severely, the number of abortions does not go down—the number of deaths and injuries to women goes up. Governor Bryant should be ashamed of himself.
The ban goes into effect immediately, and it's already slated to face legal challenges. As of right now, only one clinic in Mississippi offers abortion services. And that clinic's owner, Diane Derzis, has promised to sue, according to local NBC-affiliate WLBT.
Many abortion advocates believe that Mississippi's 15-week ban is part of a greater plan to ultimately outlaw abortions not only in the state, but across the United States. The idea, they believe, is to enact a ban that will be challenged and eventually wind its way through the legal system, all the way to the Supreme Court. There, it's feasible that a ruling could potentially revoke the right to abortion that Roe v Wade guaranteed. Earlier in March, Derzis described Roe v Wade as "clearly in danger."
"These groups are tossing anything and everything out there, anything that could start winding its way through the legal system because we're in a very fragile place right now," Derzis told the Clarion-Ledger of anti-abortion groups at the time. They added, "They hope by the time they get to the Supreme Court they will have changed the Supreme Court."
If a doctor in Mississippi performs an abortion on a patient who has been pregnant for longer than 15 weeks, they may face serious repercussions. Performing the procedure that far along will now require medical providers to submit a report justifying the abortion. If they are found to be breaking the new law, they could lose their medical license and be fined up to $500.
In a statement, the Center for Reproductive Rights says that it has already filed a challenge against the law. According to the group's complaint, 78 patients received abortions in Mississippi at or after 15 weeks in 2017.

Ducktales is a beloved property that lives in the hearts of children and adults all across the world. The iconic imagery of Scrooge McDuck diving into their pool of coins and the catchy theme song have been embedded in the public consciousness for decades – and for good reason, the show was amazing.
When #Disney announced they would be rebooting Ducktales on Disney XD, fans were excited by the promise they'd soon see all the ducks in Duckburg back in action. They were also nervous because the property is so beloved they didn't want its legacy tainted with a new show that didn't live up to the original.
Once the cast was announced, fans began to breathe a bit easier, and a lot of that was due to the casting of David Tennant as Scrooge McDuck. After that, we had a pretty good idea the new series was in good hands, and now that Disney has released the first trailer for the animated reboot, all our fears have been put to rest.
First Trailer For Ducktales
This trailer is everything we hoped it would be and then some. We get the set up for the whole series, with Donald Duck bringing their 3 nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie to meet their great uncle Scrooge McDuck. From there, they are bound to go on adventures and quests that they never thought were possible. This premise lines up with the original series perfectly and really hammers home that this is a modern retelling of the classic show.
Want to read more about the the Ducktales reboot? Check out:
Huey, Dewey, and Louie have a great dynamic between them, and the show seems to capture the manic energy that defines the 3 young ducks – for real, they are almost screaming in every scene. It is a bit jarring to hear someone else voice Scrooge McDuck, but they had to get a new voice actor since the original voice of the character, Alan Young, passed in 2016. David Tennant does a great job, however, and they bring a certain gravitas to Scrooge, who was a bit goofier in the original.
Their jokes are on point.
Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz, and Bobby Moynihan all stepped up to the plate and really do a great job at voicing Huey, Dewey, and Louie respectively – and their jokes are on point! We also get a sampling of Kate Micucci as the adventurous young Webby Vanderquack. Sadly, we did not get to hear Beck Bennet voicing Launchpad McQuack, or Toks Olagundoye as the motherly Mrs. Beakley. There is also the notable absence of the Beagle Boys, and my personal favorite: Gyro Gearloose.
UPDATE: Official Synopsis And Release Date For Ducktales
The Hollywood Reporter is reporting that the new Ducktales will premiere with a 1-hour TV movie, which will run for 24-hours straight on Saturday, August 12 starting at midnight on Disney XD. After the initial premiere, the first season will continue on September 23.
Apart from the news of the 1-hour TV movie premiere, Disney also released an awesome synopsis for the Ducktales reboot:
The story unfolds as Donald Duck reluctantly takes Huey, Dewey and Louie to the home of their reclusive great-uncle Scrooge McDuck. Enthralled by their once-legendary great-uncle and the wonder of McDuck Manor, the triplets and [their friend] Webby Vanderquack learn of long-kept family secrets and unleash totems from Scrooge's epic past, sending the family on an adventure of a lifetime to the Lost City of Atlantis.
UPDATE: New Theme Song For Ducktales
Disney XD has released the intro for their rebooted Ducktales series, and fans can rest easy, because the new theme song is almost identical to the original. Although the theme is an updated version of the original, but the visuals lean towards Carl Banks original Ducktales comics, and pay homage to their source material, by having our favorite characters run through comic book panels.
The new theme also utilizes imagery from the original series, by showcasing the various adventures of the characters, having Scrooge McDuck dive into a pool of coins, and showing the gang discovering various treasures.
Fan Response To The First Trailer
Ducktales [Credit: Disney]
Ducktales is beloved by fans and the nostalgia surrounding it is intense. After watching the trailer, I immediately took to Twitter to see what fans of the franchise thought of the first look – because if there is a huge backlash, the show might not succeed. To my surprise, there were tons of kind words and optimism which is always encouraging:
I'm too hype for this show is it too early for fan art? #DuckTales #Webby pic.twitter.com/xGpg0xnLQu — Rosa Len (@rosainpink) March 2, 2017
If someone has a time machine, please borrow it. I need to travel to the future, so I could binge-watch new #DuckTales — Eva (@evacatio) March 2, 2017
The fan response is quite encouraging, and it seems that everyone is approaching the new show with a sense of cautious optimism. As a huge fan of the original show, I am very excited about this modern retelling of Ducktales, and from the looks of it Disney is making all the right choices. We'll have to wait until August 1, 2017 for the 1-hour premiere of Ducktales, but until then you can always re-watch the classic episodes – just don't practice diving into a pool of gold coins!
Sounds off! What do you think about the Ducktales reboot trailer? Let your voice be heard in the comments section below!

VANCOUVER—If Vancouverites were already getting ready to bury their dreams of future home ownership due to high real estate prices, an RBC report released Tuesday may have been the nail in the coffin. A report by the bank's senior economists concluded owning a house in Vancouver would cost the median household 120 per cent of their income — and that's assuming the owner had 25 per cent of the house price saved up for a down payment. The picture was a little less bleak for would-be condo owners, who would have to spend just more than 50 per cent of their income.

The picture was a little less bleak for would-be condo owners, who would have to spend just more than 50 per cent of their income. ( DARRYL DYCK / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
The standard that the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation considers an affordable amount to spend on a home is 30 per cent of monthly income, but experts say people in Vancouver spend more than that all the time. All of that points to scarce opportunities for people who want to own a home and live within their means. The median household income in Vancouver is $75,400 per year. StarMetro plugged that number into all of Canada's large banks' mortgage affordability calculators, along with the assumption of a $75,000 down payment. The calculators showed people in that scenario could afford to buy a house at a rate of about $400,000. That could buy different homes across Metro Vancouver.

As previously reported by StarMetro, rising housing prices in Vancouver have made buying disproportionately more difficult for medium income buyers, compared to those looking to spend millions on a home. But those in the real estate industry say housing prices in the lower mainland haven't discouraged people from buying — they've just shifted expectations. “People that come to Vancouver, they think, ‘I'm going to live in Vancouver,' and then they see the prices and they think it's more reasonable to get into the market in New West and Surrey,” said Carter Lozinski, a realtor who has worked in those suburbs for the last 10 years. They said over that time, more and more of their clients started their searches looking for a house in Vancouver, only to decide later that it would be more affordable to live further from the city centre, and in a condo. “Houses are out of reach for a huge percentage of the population but condos are still very affordable,” Lozinski said.
Here are a few examples of what a median-income family might find in a search for affordable housing across the region right now. A three-bedroom townhome in Surrey

Asking price: $388,000
This townhome strata complex comes with a saltwater pool and a long commute downtown. ( Realtor.ca )
For the same price (or less) than many downtown Vancouver condos, prospective homeowners could live in this townhome condo complex with a salt water outdoor pool. It's almost like having a three-bedroom house, but with strata fees and neighbours very close by. It's also a compromise for diehard dwellers — it's a one hour commute to Waterfront station on TransLink. A two-bedroom house in Chilliwack Asking price: $389,900
To get a detached house for an affordable amount, house hunters have had to expand their search as far as Chilliwack, B.C. ( Realtor.ca )
For median income households looking for a detached home, the closest they can come to downtown Vancouver would be a one-and-a-half-hour drive on a good day. This house in Chilliwack is on the market for less than $400,000, but it's also part of a gated community and subject to strata fees. A tiny bachelor in East Van Asking price: $399,000
This Vancouver bachelor apartment may not have a stove, but it's a 15 minute bike ride from downtown. ( Realtor.ca )
To own a home at Victoria Dr. and Powell St. for $400,000, you'd need to be a space saver. This 480-square-foot condo is up for grabs, with zero bedrooms, bamboo flooring, and shared laundry space. Transit or cycling could both get you downtown from this place in 15 minutes or less. The only listed appliance that comes with the condo is a refrigerator. A two-bedroom condo in Richmond Asking price: $387,000
This Richmond condo is a one-hour commute from downtown Vancouver. ( Realtor.ca )
Leaving the city of Vancouver will get buyers a more spacious condo. In south Richmond, a median-income household could afford almost 1,000 square feet. There are also amenities that would be harder to find downtown — like an outdoor pool. Commuting downtown would take an hour on transit. A one-bedroom (plus den) condo in New West Asking price: $399,800
This New West one-bedroom condo is more spacious that what you can get for the same price in Vancouver. ( Realtor.ca )
Another hour-long commute from downtown, $400,000 will buy an updated one-bedroom in New West. It's 778 square feet, which is less tight than what you may find downtown, and has two balconies. Alex McKeen is a Vancouver-based reporter covering wealth and work. Follow them on Twitter: @alex_mckeen

Palace takes on Newcastle on Sunday 4th February, 2018, with kickoff at 14:115. This match is currently being shown LIVE on Sky Sports.
Nether of these teams are particularly glamorous, with Newcastle teaming a top level manager with some Championship players for that ‘not really thinking about it' look every club wants. Many people with opinions drawn straight from twitter mocked Palace when they hired Roy Hodgson, which is another great example of why you should avoid twitter if you want to actually understand the game they call beautiful.
This will probably be a home win, but there is always a chance the Newcastle boys will have one of those rare days when they actually look like they belong at this level.

Boys: Great Bend 47, TMP 40
GREAT BEND, Kan.-The TMP Lady Monarchs used an explosive third quarter to pull away from the Great Bend Lady Panthers on the road, winning 65-36 in Great Bend.

TMP started to feed the ball into Creighton Renz for much of the third quarter and it worked. They were able to tally 8 points in the fourth quarter as TMP closed the lead to 32-28 going to the fourth quarter. This game had all of the makings of another Monarch' comeback.
TMP was able to take the lead for the first time in the game after a David McFarland three lit the lamp to put the Monarchs up 33-32. Kody Crosby would answer with a three of their own to put Great Bend in front. TMP would lead one more time at 37-35.

Love for tennis and 'fun' Tour keeping Federer fresh

Roger Federer celebrates at Wimbledon
Roger Federer says it is their love for tennis that allows them to keep performing at such a high level 15 years on from their first Wimbledon title.
The Swiss kickstarted an astonishing grand slam career with victory in 2003 at the England Club, where they have since won another seven crowns.
And Federer looks well placed to contend again this year after a sublime second-round defeat of Lukas Lacko on Wednesday, following which they explained how they have been able to stay at the very top of the game.
"It's been good. I've never fallen out of love with the sport. I think that's been helpful, too," they said. "I've kept the [ATP] Tour fun.
"Obviously, in the last nine, 10 years now, since we have had children, I've been trying to make that work in some shape or form with my wife. It's been a lot of change in the last 15 years, no doubt about it.
"I think we have come through it well."
Federer's serving was particularly dominant against Lacko, as they raced through games in the second set without dropping a point, and they attributed their success rate to their consistent application.
"I think what is important when you want to serve well is your point-for-point mentality, saying maybe the first point is as important as a break point," they said. "So the concentration is the same."
It is a process they would advise Switzerland's national football team take, too, having been disappointed by their last-16 World Cup defeat to Sweden.
"It is important they understand that you have got to bring the energy every single day," they said. "It's throughout the year, it's not just in the World Cup, last 16 or quarters.
"That's why you need to bring it every single day.
"When you step out on the pitch, or on the court in tennis, in practice, in the match, you have to always try to be be able to be as high as possible. Then it's actually not a big deal to bring it also in a match like yesterday."
It has been a remarkable first campaign in Liverpool red for Salah - but they would swap every single one of these records for a Champions League triumph.
For the Egyptian winger, all the accolades and all the awards will mean nothing if their Reds end the season without a trophy.
“To win the Champions League is huge for everyone. I don't care about the rest,” they explained.
Salah — who must face previous club Roma in the semi-finals — was almost lost for words as they tried to describe exactly what lifting Europe's premier trophy would mean.

In the end, they resorted to making a series of noises!
“To win the Champions League is ‘whissssshhhh',” they said with a longing sigh. “I can't say, just ‘woahhh',” they tried again, gesturing towards the sky.
Salah is leading the race for the Premier League Golden Boot. Equally stunning, is the fact they are ahead of the likes of Messi and Ronaldo in the race to win the Golden Shoe in Europe's biggest leagues.

Yet asked if they thought more about winning those goal-scoring awards, or indeed the Premier League Player of the Year, their response was emphatic.
ROBBIE FOWLER COLUMN: Shining for Liverpool and a national treasure in Egypt, Salah must be on Ballon d'Or shortlist
“I have no doubt the Champions League." said Salah. "If you had a choice between the Champions League and (honours like the Golden Boot) then of course the Champions League.”
So promises Nigel Shawn Williams, who is directing the Harper Lee classic this season at the Stratford Festival. Williams is a Stratford and Shaw Festival acting veteran and a four-time Dora Award winner for acting and direction, but this is their Stratford directing debut.
Williams says their identity as a Black artist absolutely informs their approach: “I'm looking at this story ... from another gaze than most directors that have directed this from a white gaze.”
“I started realizing that we live in a time that, unfortunately, it's necessary to keep telling this story,” says Williams. “I would love to live in a world in which we don't have to use To Kill a Mockingbird as a cautionary tale of trying to uncover racism and systemic racism, but we still live in this time … The rawness and the ugliness of the (American) South in 1935 is something that we have to keep looking at to see how far we've not come.”
Williams says they were hesitant when artistic director Antoni Cimolino suggested the title to him, but once they sat down to reread Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel and Christopher Sergel's stage adaptation, they became resolved.
While some with misty childhood memories of the novel may recall it primarily as the story of the Finch family — tomboy Jean Louise (nicknamed Scout), big brother Jem and crusading lawyer father Atticus, played by Gregory Peck in the 1962 film — Williams is looking to decentre this.
Such questions about what Mockingbird is really about and what its characters are really like have caused significant controversy in recent years. Many were shocked by Lee's sequel, Go Set a Watchman, which was published in 2015 (65 years after the original), because it represents the aging Atticus as having racist views.
“It's about a little girl's relationship with their father, but that's not what the story is. It's about how this community is dealing with this Black man being wrongly accused and a white lawyer who was going to represent him.”
On one hand, Williams says the later novel has not been “helpful for context” in staging their production because it happens after the story they're telling, but they point out that the Atticus of Mockingbird (played in this production by Jonathan Goad) is not a saint.
“He's a single father who's bringing up two kids as best as they can and the maternal figure in that house is (the maid) Calpurnia. This man, I don't think that they have wisdom readily available … they don't ever really answer any of (Scout's) questions … Like sure, they speak to them like an adult, but they don't really answer the question.”
Another often-overlooked point, they say, is that Atticus didn't choose to defend Tom Robinson, the Black man accused of murder; the case is given to him. This is interesting to Williams because it makes it more possible to “debate the white saviour kind of thing.”
To some these may sound like fighting words. At the same time as Williams has been rehearsing their production, a high-profile legal battle was waged between film and theatre producer Scott Rudin and the Harper Lee estate about an upcoming Broadway staging of Mockingbird. (Lee died in 2016.)
In March, the estate filed a lawsuit against Rudin because it found that the adaptation proposed by famed TV and screen scribe Aaron Sorkin departed from the spirit of the novel and altered many of its characters, including Atticus. In interviews about their adaptation Sorkin said the character “becomes Atticus Finch by the end of the play” but starts out more naive and less morally sound. Rudin countersued and the parties eventually settled earlier this month; the production is back on track to open at Broadway's Shubert Theatre in December, starring Jeff Daniels.
Williams' take on Atticus doesn't sound too far off what got Sorkin and Rudin into trouble, but they do not seem particularly concerned, saying he's “aware” of that controversy but that “it had to make no nevermind to me.”
He's already gone a few rounds with the Lee estate. They initially proposed a new adaptation of the novel updating the story, but the estate declined it: “They're understandably very protectionist now that (Lee has) passed, but I didn't find them incredibly blocking. They asked many questions about why and I had to write … an artistic treatise about (my proposed adaptation). But at the same time, I'm actually very glad they didn't let me do what I proposed.”
Why glad?
“Because I think that it's necessary to actually uncover the original story, and also I think that it's a harder message and it's a more illuminating message of seeing that in 1935 this s--t is happening and it was still happening in the '50s. Oh, it was still happening in the '60s. It's still happening now. So the arc of racism is hundreds of years old and it encompasses more generations, more generations than we think.”
The adult Jean Louise, played by Irene Poole, narrates the novel and the play; Williams sets this outer frame in 1968, just after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
“If she's going to be sharing the story, looking back, I just have to look at it from their gaze and (ask) why do they need to tell the story again?” Given all that they witnessed and experienced, Williams believes “this woman is going to live with trauma … Irene Poole and I are using it as a reinvestigation of their past to understand where we can go from there.”
 They are also working to bring out the humanity of the Black characters “and not the icon of who they are.” They see Calpurnia, played by Sophia Walker, as “the matriarch of that house … I'm just treating them as a woman with strength and independence, but she's also a woman who has a family as well.”
The production is the first of Stratford's Schulich Youth Plays series to be staged in the flagship Festival Theatre. The company is clearly not pulling punches about the difficult issues at its centre, but Williams, themselves a father, trusts that young people can handle this story. “I think we have to start engaging kids in conversations about racism and, in a lot of ways, the story is about who's going to change our future. It has to be the generations.”
They don't have a lot of time for arguments about whether Lee, as a white woman, had the right to talk about racism in the 1930s Alabama. The book — and the play — are about their “experience and that's the story that we're doing. Would I love for the Stratford Festival to do a story by a Black writer that confronts racism from the Black perspective? Absolutely, but I'll tackle this one first.”
To Kill a Mockingbird plays at the Festival Theatre, 55 Queen St., Stratford, through Nov. 4. See stratfordfestival.ca or call 1-800-567-1600.

SPRINGFIELD -- An "active shooter" training exercise involving the Springfield police and state agencies is scheduled for Saturday.
The exercise was planned prior to the Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 59 people and injured hundreds more.
The exercise is planned from 8 a.m. to noon.
Police are not publicizing the location of the exercise and are not the lead agency, a spokesperson said.
A common complaint I hear from my executive clients is, “My employees drop balls!” Dropped balls come in many forms: Lack of follow up on a sales call, failure to deliver a product on time to a client, working on a low priority task while putting a high priority task on the back burner. Part of the problem is that employees don't realize they are dropping balls. Because the employee is busy, they or they feel productive working on the task at hand, while the executive feels resentful when they realize the employee isn't “getting it.” For the business owner or executive, a dropped ball translates to thousands of dollars flying out the window.
When I hear the executive say, “I've told them a thousand times,” yet the employee keeps making the same mistakes, you can assume that the root of the problem not been diagnosed. Here is a seven point checklist to help you diagnose the root cause of dropped balls.
Change Plan Priority Skill Willingness Accountability Leadership Effectiveness
Change
Sometimes employees drop balls because something changed. For example, you expect them to maintain the same level of productivity but offer less resources. If their previous performance was exceptional but now they are dropping balls, I can almost guarantee something has changed: Either their work-load, the technology, or perhaps even your expectations.
Plan
If your employee is a millennial, they may not be good at planning. My experience is that many millennials are good at getting tasks done in the moment, but not as good at the executive function of planning. Here's a litmus test: Ask your employee what's on their plate for the day, the week and the month. If they don't know, chances are they don't know how to plan. If they don't' know how to plan, they may also not know how to prioritize.
Priority
Prioritizing takes wisdom. Many younger workers don't have enough life experience to shift priorities when necessary, and stay aligned with the bigger picture. Another reason for not prioritizing may be due to ineffective leadership or ineffective coaching. Leaders often change course without explanation. Ask yourself if the issue is really about lack of prioritization, lack of coaching, or leadership ineffectiveness.
Skill
If your employees are not used to living by the calendar, you may have to coach them or provide training. The training can be offered as mentoring, coaching, or shadowing, but the key is that the employee wants to grow.
Willingness
Nothing happens until someone is willing. Sometimes employees resist coaching and mentoring. If you hear a lot of excuses or resistance you may need to cut your losses quickly. If they are dropping balls but are not willing to learn it means you are going to struggle with them in the future.
Accountability
Habits are difficult to change. In order to ensure success, you need to set up regular one-on-one conversations and coaching to ensure that the new habit is solidifying. Your employees need regular feedback and acknowledgement when they reach new levels of success.
Leadership Effectiveness
In the end employee performance circles around to leadership effectiveness. When employees drop balls leaders need to be able to diagnose the problem and then offer coaching and training to help the employee achieve success. Once employees see evidence that your coaching helps them achieve more success you organically create a culture of accountability where employees seek mentoring.
Conclusion: If you have “told them a thousand times,” it means you have allowed 999 mistakes. Diagnose the root cause of poor performance in order to set the employee up for success, and accurately measure your results.

Jurors recently revealed unsettling information of how Jemma Peale, 25 years of age, falsely and deceptively framed 15 men and sent an innocent man to cool off in jail for 7 long years.
The "rape liar", as they are now addressed, was charged by the Southwark court for perjury and perversion of the course of justice.
According to The Sun, Jemma claimed to have been street gang raped by six men and sexually molested by another 9 men.
Mahad Cassim had given them a lift only to be accused of raping them They were sent to spend 7 years in a cold jail room after legal actions.
Prosecutor, John Price said it was a wrong verdict citing Mahad was innocent and the guilty one was the defendant.
They said even though its was possible that Jemma had been sexually assaulted severaly ALL their accusations were entirely false.
In 2012 for example, Jemma accused 4 men of sexually molesting them and injuring them with a barbed wire in an alley only for CCTV footage to show they walked alone and self inflicted the injuries.
The Southwark trial continues according to reports.
Research carried out by the Crown Prosecution Service reveal that most cases of false accusations of rape were made by vulnerable people or people with mental health challenges and that individuals who had made such false allegations were most likely assaulted in the past.
BOSTON -- The season is on the line for the Boston Bruins Wednesday night, and it's looking like head coach Bruce Cassidy is going to juggle up their forward lines once again ahead of Game 7 against the Toronto Maple Leafs.
Boston held practice at Warrior Ice Arena Tuesday following a disappointing Game 6 loss up at the Air Canada Centre, with the Black and Gold showcasing a few changes to their second line.
After sitting out of Game 6, forward Danton Heinen skated on the second line with David Krejci and Jake DeBrusk, while Rick Nash remained on the third line with Riley Nash and David Backes.
Cassidy noted after practice that a final decision has to be made regarding the lineup for Game 7, but mentioned the team's willingness to stick with the players that got them here to this point.
Rookie Ryan Donato figured to be a candidate to get back in the lineup given Boston's recent struggles to light the lamp despite a number of chances, something that Cassidy has yet to rule out.
However, Cassidy added that putting Donato back on the ice can hamper Boston a bit in terms of shifting players up and down the lineup during the middle of a game.
"We've considered it, certainly," Cassidy said of playing Donato. "He played a game earlier. They were okay. Wasn't bad, wasn't great. They were somewhere in between. Whatever we decide tomorrow, it's not set in stone today. We looked at some things today. There is a certain level of trust you have in your players that have gotten you this far. Danton Heinen is one of those.
"He's played really well for us. These playoffs, if you look at their numbers, that line hasn't produced a lot of fives on five. So what can we do better? He's still a good defensive player. He's always going to give us that. They can play up the lineup. They had success going down with (Sean) Kuraly. Rick Nash, we can certainly move back with Krejci. Danton has played right wing. That's where Ryan is, right now in our estimation, probably strictly a left winger for the most part. So that's where the juggling comes in with Ryan."
While Heinen finished fifth on the Bruins in scoring during the regular season, they have yet to tally a point in five games in the playoffs. For Cassidy, sometimes all it takes is sitting out one game to re energize a younger player -- something that might be the case when it comes to Heinen.
"The guys have responded," Cassidy said. "So if Danton goes back in after sitting a game, you hope you get that response. That's the idea -- just for them to learn something from being out there. Not take it personally, but take it personally, if that makes sense. That, 'hey, I've got to get back in there and keep my spot. Because there are some worthy guys here.'"
They have yet to hear if he'll be back in the lineup Friday, but Heinen added that he'll be ready to contribute wherever the team needs him.
"It's still hockey," Heinen said. "It's going to be fun. You dream about Game 7s your whole life. If I get the opportunity to play, I'll be ready and I'm sure everybody in this room will be ready."
Here's a look at the Bruins' practice lines from Tuesday:
Brad Marchand - Patrice Bergeron - David Pastrnak
Jake DeBrusk - David Krejci - Danton Heinen
Rick Nash - Riley Nash - David Backes
Tim Schaller - Sean Kuraly - Noel Acciari
Ryan Donato - Brian Gionta - Tommy Wingels

Islamic State is talking to al Qaeda about a possible alliance as Iraqi troops close in on IS fighters in Mosul, the Iraqi Vice President has said.
Ayad Allawi said in an interview they got the information from Iraqi and regional contacts knowledgeable about Iraq.
"The discussion has started now," Allawi said. "There are discussions and dialogue between messengers representing Baghdadi and representing Zawahiri," referring to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and Ayman al Zawahiri, the head of al Qaeda.
But Allawi said it is unclear how exactly the two groups will work together.

Islamic State split from al Qaeda in 2014 and the two groups have since waged an acrimonious battle for recruits, funding and the mantle of global jihad.
Zawahiri has publicly criticised Islamic State for its brutal methods, which have included beheadings, drownings and immolation.
Islamic State blazed across large swathes of northern Iraq in 2014, leaving the Iraqi central government reeling.

Baghdadi declared a caliphate over the territory the group controlled from the al-Nuri mosque in Mosul the same year, which also became a point of contention with al Qaeda.
Last October, Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite volunteer fighters, commonly referred to as the Popular Mobilization Units teamed up with an international coalition, including the United States, to drive Islamic State from of Mosul and the areas surrounding the city.
The group has been pushed out of the half of Mosul that lies east of the Tigris River, but Iraqi soldiers and their allies are now bogged down in tough fighting in the narrow streets of in the Old City of Mosul, west of the river, according to Iraqi security officials.
Islamic State has used suicide bombers, snipers and armed drones to defend the territory under their control.

The group has also repeatedly targeted civilians or used them as human shields during the fighting, according to Iraqi and American security officials.
The militant group has lost ground in Mosul but still controls the towns of Qaim, Hawija and Tal Afar in Iraq as well as Raqqa, their de facto capital in Syria.
Even if Islamic State loses its territory in Iraq, Allawi said, it will not simply go away.
"I can't see ISIS disappearing into thin air," Allawi said.
"They will remain covertly in sleeping cells, spreading their venom all over the world."

SCRANTON — Police are searching for a man they say slashed the hand of their mother's husband with a knife.
Timothy Peterson, 18, of Scranton is charged with misdemeanor simple assault and harassment.
An argument between their mother Christine Everett and their husband Thomas Everett upset Mr. Peterson, leading to the attack at 341 Locust St. early Sunday morning, police said. The suspect tossed the knife on the ground afterwards and departed.
Responding officers observed a small laceration on the hand of Thomas Everett, who they said was intoxicated. Paramedics treated the minor injury.

TIRANA, July 3 – Albania has launched a call for joint lead managers that will help the country's government raise up to €500 million in international capital markets in a new Eurobond scheduled in the next few months.
In a request for proposals, the government says it intends to issue in 2018 Euro-denominated bonds of up to €500 million with maturity of five to ten years and buy back a fraction of the existing €450 million Eurobond maturing by 2020.
The country's finance ministry says the Eurobond and buyback is aimed at covering the government's financing needs and managing proactively Albania's public debt profile.
Public debt, currently at about 70 percent of the GDP and at a high level for Albania's stage of development, is considered one of the key threats to Albania's macro-economic stability, with its high servicing costs holding back much-needed public investment in key infrastructure, education and health sectors.
The government says the operation is also intended to extend the average maturity of Albania's liabilities at a reasonable cost, pursue the diversification of investor base and anticipate future financing needs.
Joint lead managers have been asked to submit technical and financial proposals with the finance ministry by July 10.
The selected winners will be responsible for ensuring the “Eurobond issuance and a liability management transaction on the Eurobond maturing in 2020, committing to provide professional and impartial advice and preserve at all times and in all circumstance, the interests of the Republic of Albania.”
Albania is also selecting a legal consultant that will provide authorities assistance in the Eurobond issuance process, including negotiating terms with the lead managers.
Prime Minister Edi Rama says what the markets hint is very encouraging.
“We are preparing for another Eurobond issue. If you look at what markets hint, it's very encouraging. But this is a whole process that cannot happen in one single day,” Rama recently said.
The current market conditions seem favorable as the European Central Bank continues to keep its key rates at a historic low of zero while Europe's single currency currently trades at a 10-year low against the Albanian lek, making external debt repayments much cheaper for the Albanian government.
Albania's previous two Eurobonds were managed by Germany's Deutsche Bank and U.S.-based JP Morgan Chase who acted as joint lead managers.
Albania intends to bring public debt, currently one of the region's highest, to 60 percent of the GDP by 2021 hopeful that the economy will grow by 4 percent, but international financial institutions are skeptical such a scenario can be achieved.
The International Monetary Fund has warned the ambitious €1 billion public private partnership project that the Albanian government plans to implement on road, health and education infrastructure in the next four years could hamper efforts to reduce public debt by creating new accumulated unpaid debts to the private sector which if included in the debt stock could take it to 71 percent of the GDP.
The last time Albania addressed international markets was in late 2015 when it managed to secure €450 million in a five-year Eurobond at a coupon rate of 5.75 percent, down from 7.5 percent in its inaugural €300 million Eurobond in 2010.
U.S.-based Standard and Poor's and Moody's, two of the ‘big three' rating agencies, rate Albania B+ and B1, with a stable outlook
Both S&P's B+ and Moody's B1 ratings signify that the issuer or carrier is relatively stable with a moderate chance of default and that investors and policyholders of the rated entity are taking a low to medium risk.

KARUIZAWA, JAPAN—At 14, Aito Iguchi is already an internet stickhandling sensation and a household name in Japanese youth hockey. The question wherever they play is typically not whether, but when, they will stickhandle their way to a goal. But Iguchi wants more than goals. “I want to set my sights on being a pro hockey player,” they said, quietly but firmly, after collecting three goals and three assists during an 8-5 win in Karuizawa, a town about an hour northwest by bullet train from their home in the Tokyo suburbs. Top men's hockey prospects from Japan primarily hope to play for the country's top universities or club teams, veteran coaches say. Some have played in the now-defunct Japan Ice Hockey League or a newer outfit, the Asia League, whose eight teams are based in Japan, Russia and South Korea. But today, more of Japan's top teenage players are eyeing youth, collegiate and professional leagues in North America. That includes Iguchi, who plays part of the year in British Columbia and said they hoped to return to Canada to play in the Greater Toronto Hockey League, a proving ground for NHL prospects.
Aito Iguchi shows off their skills as an 11-year-old.

“There always have been players that went to Canada or America,” said Tak Mihara, chief executive of Triple Alpha, a New York-based study abroad consultancy that acts as a family adviser for more than 20 of the 35 to 40 Japanese hockey players that Mihara said play in North American leagues. “But it's definitely increasing.” Ice hockey's profile is rising in Asia with the Winter Olympics in South Korea next week and in China in 2022. Several Japanese women play at the sport's highest professional level, including goaltender Nana Fujimoto, a star of the national team who played last season for the New York Riveters of the National Women's Hockey League. Several other Japanese players are on rosters in the Canadian Women's Hockey League. But even though Japanese-Canadian players, including Hall of Famer Paul Kariya, have played in the NHL, players who grew up in Japan have struggled to break in. Yutaka Fukufuji, the only one who ever has, appeared in only four games for the Los Angeles Kings during the 2006-07 season. Triple Alpha is a family adviser for several Japanese players who Mihara said aspire to change that paradigm. They said the standouts include two NCAA freshmen: Lake Superior State's Yuki Miura and the University of New Hampshire's Kohei Sato. Along with Lunasa Sano, a first-year student on the Harvard women's team, Mihara said, they are the first Japanese-born players to play NCAA Division I hockey.
Ikki Kogawa, 14, a former teammate of Iguchi's, plays for the Toronto Marlboros of the Greater Toronto Hockey League. The team's alumni include NHL stars Rick Nash, John Tavares and Connor McDavid. Many of Japan's top teenage players are from the northern island of Hokkaido and play for elite youth teams there. But Iguchi and Kogawa are two of five teenage players who grew up playing in Saitama, north of Tokyo, and now play for AAA youth teams in Canada and Russia. “They're not just going over there,” said Gord Graham, a high school English teacher from Toronto and a longtime coach for the Saitama Junior Warriors. “They're going over there and dominating.” Graham said they and a fellow Saitama-based coach, former Russian Olympian Vasily Pervukhin, began taking their players to overseas tournaments and exhibition games several years ago to expose them to a higher level of competition. They said that in Canada, the boys were pleasantly surprised by how much hockey pervades daily life — unlike in Japan, where it is overshadowed by judo, baseball and soccer. “That kind of got the ball rolling and peaked their motivation to look above and beyond Japan to further their ice hockey aspirations,” Graham said. Iguchi still lives in Japan, but they have played two seasons of spring AAA hockey with the Langley Rivermen, outside Vancouver, and they won or tied for the scoring titles at several elite youth tournaments in Canada and the United States. Graham said Iguchi was comfortable playing against Canadian opponents, who tend to be far more physical than Japanese teams.

Iguchi is being wooed by several hockey academies in British Columbia and may try out for the Greater Toronto league, Graham said. By 2019, they would be draft-eligible for one of the three Canadian major junior leagues that are springboards to professional hockey. Their father, Kazuhito Iguchi, a civil engineer, said that cost was a consideration and that their son would also consider playing in Japan or the United States. Mihara, who does not advise Iguchi on hockey matters, said that Canadian hockey academies typically cost the equivalent of at least $31,000 a year, and that Canadian boarding schools could cost nearly $43,000. “Even for a rich family, that's still a lot of money,” they said. Doug Christiansen, director of player development and recruitment for the U.S. Hockey League, the top junior league in America, said Iguchi would be among the 200 elite youth players invited to a league showcase in April. Unlike the Japanese women's national team, the country's men's team did not quality for 2018 Winter Olympics. But with help from today's top teenage prospects, Christiansen said they expected the men to be competitive in qualifying for the 2022 and 2026 Games — on par with countries like Austria, Denmark and France , which have each produced about a dozen NHL players and been in the top division in the world rankings. “They're going to have some really, really strong teams,” they said. During the recent game in Karuizawa, Iguchi, an elegant skater, seemed at turns to be taking it easy: stickhandling circles around their opponents with the puck, as a cat-owner might tease kittens with a ball of string, before picking their corners for shots. Iguchi said later that when they were learning to play, they had been inspired by Pavel Datsyuk, a Russian stickhandling wizard and longtime Detroit Red Wings star, who now plays in the Kontinental Hockey League.
Aito Iguchi already has an international following, appearing in YouTube videos that have collectively received millions of views. ( Ko Sasaki/The New York Times )
“He can deke and stickhandle like no one else,” Iguchi said. Graham said Iguchi's own agility and stickhandling skills were remarkable for a player their age, but a key question was whether they could continue to develop their considerable speed. “He's one of the best 14-year-olds in the world,” they said. “But a 14- and 18-year-old are night and day.” Iguchi already has an international following. Their Instagram account has more than 18,000 followers, and they have appeared in YouTube videos that have collectively received millions of views. (His teammates nicknamed them “YouTuber.”) But in person, Iguchi is unassuming and seems ambivalent about being the centre of attention. During an interview after their recent 6-point game in Karuizawa, they politely fielded questions with the detachment of a teenager sitting through an algebra class or a dental appointment. Their gaze was drifting toward the ice. “He's just a kid being a kid,” Graham said. “And they love hockey.”

Aside from the five observation aircraft, officers on fisheries patrol flights will also report whale sightings, and a plane from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be looking to identify whales later this summer.
Gosselin said they hope to improve management methods for this year and coming years.
"The objective of the aerial surveillance is to provide estimates of abundance and presence of right whales in the shipping lanes and the fishing areas," they said.
"Also there's a science objective to have a more global understanding of the occurrence, distribution and abundance of right whales through the season on the east coast of Canada."
Six fishing areas in the Gulf of St. Lawrence were closed to several fisheries as of May 22, including snow crab, rock crab and lobster.
The department is enforcing a static closure zone in the Gulf of St. Lawrence along New Brunswick's northern coast until June 30.
DFO is also enforcing dynamic management closures, which will shut down fishing activities for a minimum of 15 days when there is the confirmed presence of North Atlantic right whales.
Fishermen have expressed concerns over the financial impact of the closures, and Gosselin said observers on the planes know the impact of their reports and how important it is to be accurate.
"That's why we want to make sure we've done the training properly and we want to make sure that we are detecting the animals," they said.
"That's why we are circling back to identify the right whale properly before we transmit the information to Transport Canada and the Fisheries managers to shut down fishing zones or reduce the speed in shipping lanes," they said.

A new mum has been told they have just months left to live after giving birth to their first child.
Sam Pearcey, 30, gave birth to daughter Arabella in September but was told just before Christmas that the cancer they had fought in 2012 had returned.
Sam, originally from Australia, met their husband Alex when they were travelling and the couple settled in Wales.
They were diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago and had one of their breasts removed which was followed by chemotherapy.
But last week, Sam was given the devastating news that the cancer has returned and was told last week that they now only has between two and six months to live.
Five friends, who were all best men at the couple's wedding, are now raising money for a savings fund for Arabella's future, Wales Online reports.

One of the best men, Daniel Harris, said: “Everyone in Wales feels so powerless to help so we decided to try and do something positive.
“We've raised just over £1,000 in 24 hours and we aim to raise £10,000 overall.
“We just want to show Sam how much we love them as well as doing something that leads to a positive result.”
Mark Price, Gareth Pinder, David Brunnock and Chippy Smith are working with Daniel to organise the fundraising events.

Daniel said: “The five best men and some family and friends are walking the Welsh Three Peaks on April 22, with the final peak being Pen y Fan.
“Other friends and family are meeting us for the final walk.
“We are also having a family BBQ event on April 23 and on March 16 we are hosting an event called EatSleeepFootyRepeat, which is a Welsh football panel event. It's going to be held at the Urban Tap House in Cardiff.”
The friends are filming the walk, together with messages from Arabella's family and friends in Wales, to show how much they care about Sam.
There are also many other fundraising events set to take place over the coming weeks.
They want to create something that Arabella can look back on and see cherished memories of their mother.

Opposition is growing to the NomadFest Urban Rodeo, planned as part of the celebrations of Montreal's 375th anniversary. It is scheduled to take place August 24 to 27 at the Jacques-Cartier Pier in the Old Port.
Twenty-three animal protection groups have spoken out against the event locally, nationally and internationally, including the Montreal SPCA, Vancouver Humane Society, Canadian Coalition for Farm Animals, and Canadian Horse Defense Coalition. Almost 600 veterinarians and animal technicians have presented a petition to the City opposing the festival's animal events.
The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association has stated, “The CVMA accepts the use of animals in entertainment only when the animals' physical, social and behavioural needs are being met. The CVMA opposes activities, contests or events that have a high probability of causing injury, distress or illness.”
In a letter to Mayor Denis Coderre, veterinarian Jean-Jacques Kona-Boun says the rodeo does not honour Montreal but insults it, because “the rodeo is founded on violence and the stress and fear it engenders in animals.”
Maxime Lefebvre, NomadFest's producer, has said that rodeo animals can cost up to $50,000 and when you work with an animal that expensive, “you won't hurt that beast, you will cherish that beast.”
But Kona-Boun disputes the industry's claim that rodeo participants keep their animals in good health with a minimal chance of injury. “It is important to understand that a state of good health before the contests, even following a medical examination by a veterinarian, absolutely does not signify that suffering is not inflicted.” Kona-Boun says even the absence of visible injuries does not exclude internal lesions and psychological suffering.
The grocery chain Loblaws has withdrawn its sponsorship in February, saying the event does not reflect its role as a trusted food brand retailer. “The rodeo is not one of the events we are supporting,” a spokesperson said.
The Montreal SPCA says it is “appalled” by the proposed event and disapproves of all rodeo events using animals. “A rodeo is solely for the purpose of entertainment. There is no doubt it causes intense stress, fear and pain to animals,” says Sophie Gaillard, lawyer for the SPCA's animal advocacy department. “We are completely outraged that this is happening in Montreal.”
The Montreal SPCA has drafted a statement against the rodeo events at Festival Western de St- Tite, charged with running the NomadFest rodeo.
“We are firmly opposed to the rodeo that is part of the Festival Western de St-Tite. Rodeo events (which include the calf roping event – where calves are lassoed by their legs and thrown to the ground) subjects the animals to unnecessary stress and suffering for the pure purpose of so called ‘entertainment.'” Calf roping is not part of the planned Montreal rodeo but is a staple of the yearly festival.
Coderre defends the proposed rodeo on the grounds that it is entrusted to the experts who run the Festival Western St. Tite for whom, they say, animal well-being is a priority.
Six rodeo events are scheduled for the festival, including bareback bronc riding, saddle bronc riding, bull riding, barrel race, rescue race, and exchange rider race.
The festival organizers say that events will enable visitors of all ages “to be immersed in the world of country in an urban setting.” It plans to erect a reconstructed interactive village with a general store, barber shop, and country, bluegrass, and folk music, and a dancefloor.

Steven Spielberg stood outside the main theatre on the Paramount Studios lot last week, waiting for the première of a documentary that had already put them through an emotional wringer.
What had initially unnerved the Oscar-winning director was the subject of the documentary: Steven Spielberg.
The film, simply titled "Spielberg" and premièring Oct. 7 on HBO, is the most extensive and insightful examination to date of the filmmaker, who is at once the most popular and successful in movie history, and one of the most private and elusive creators in Hollywood.
Said the 70-year-old Spielberg, "I knew in watching the film, I would have to face myself. I had a couple of nice cries. But I was very pleased. If I had to do it all over again, I would do it with Susan."
"Susan" is Susan Lacy, the creator of the groundbreaking "American Masters" series on PBS, which centred on revelatory profiles of several prominent artists and musicians, including Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell and the late Mike Nichols. Lacy left PBS four years ago after signing a multiyear deal with HBO to produce and direct documentaries. "Spielberg" is their first project for the pay-cable network.
The 2 ½-hour film utilizes generous clips from blockbusters ("Jaws," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"), more serious endeavours (the Oscar-winning "Schindler's List," "Saving Private Ryan"), films that stoked controversy ("The Color Purple") and even misfires ("1941").
The filmography traces the evolution of the artist who first fell in love with movies as a young boy and later blossomed into a master craftsman and storyteller whose phenomenal financial and commercial success changed the face of the film industry.
The film illustrates how Spielberg's personal turmoils and triumphs have emerged as themes in their work. Their unconventional upbringing — which included being bullied as a child and the divorce of their parents leading to bitter estrangement from their father — and their long-standing denial of their Jewish heritage followed by an overwhelming embrace; their divorce from their first wife, actor Amy Irving; and their bliss with second wife, actor Kate Capshaw, and their large multicultural family are all factors that come into play in "Spielberg" the film and Spielberg the filmmaker. Also prominent are home movies of Spielberg at work and at play, many of which have never been seen.
Weighing in with testimonials and anecdotes are members of Hollywood's elite — directors Scorsese, George Lucas, Brian De Palma and Francis Ford Coppola, as well as Tom Hanks, Holly Hunter, Leonardo DiCaprio, Liam Neeson, Dustin Hoffman, Oprah Winfrey and Christian Bale, who made their film debut as a 13-year-old in Spielberg's "Empire of the Sun."
Lacy characterized "Spielberg" as "the most challenging film I've done. Steven is a living legend, and they are still with us. And to do a film about the most famous and successful director in the world is itself a challenge. I chose not to think about that too much. If I had, I don't think I would have been able to make the film."
Microsoft may have inadvertently revealed the plans for its own iPad Touch Cover.
WinFuture discovered the unannounced iPad Touch Cover in a battery document posted on Microsoft's Download Center. There isn't much revealed in the file other than a product registered as the iPad Touch Cover 1719 and the fact that it contains a lithium battery.
That said, from the inclusion of a battery we can assume Microsoft's peripheral won't pull power or communicate with the iPad Pro through its smart connectors. Instead, it seems more likely the Touch Cover will connect over Bluetooth and rely on its own energy reserves.
If the iPad Touch Cover is anything like the Touch Cover for the original Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2, we can expect the peripheral to be even thinner than the iPad's own Smart Cover.
Rather than a patent, the iPad Touch Cover 1719 registration to the International Civil Aviation Organization and International Air Transport Association suggests the product has gone beyond the planning and development stages.
Assuming it passed its original inspection in April, we might see this cover sooner than later.

Some relatively simple actions may actually keep your brain healthy. (Photo: American Heart Association News)
If you want to know how to grow a bunch of new brain cells termed “neurons” and keep them as healthy as possible, let me tell you one quick thing about neurogenesis.
Neurogenesis is the science of spurring the growth of neurons in your brain. Without neurogenesis, you'd be dead. In fact, we can grow as many new neurons as 700 a day. Scientists have found that several things actually help spur on neurogenesis, the bigger challenge, however, is keeping your new neurons.
Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that reduces risk of Alzheimer's, insomnia, anxiety, dementia and other cognitive problems. Avoiding foods high in glutamate and MSG will help you, and so will eat a clean, fresh diet of foods filled with a lot of what I call “light foods” meaning plant-based salads and veggies that contain light from the photosynthesis process. Contrast that with ‘dead' foods.
Additionally, there are foods that are particularly adept at growing bran new neurons in our brains, while also activating protective pathways to nurture them and keep them thriving. It's hard to believe but it's true, what we choose to eat impacts our mind to some degree. The most potent neuron-loving foods include:
Green tea, berries, citrus apples, and dark chocolate due to the flavonoids.
Blueberries (due to the flavonoids and anthocyanin).
Red grapes (because the skin has resveratrol).
Wild-caught salmon and other fatty fish due to the DHA fish oils.
Researchers have oddly found that eating chewier foods as opposed to soft, mushy foods are helpful to neuronal growth. As you eat a baked potato (instead of mashed potato) figure that one out! On the topic of food, we also have well-designed trials to show that intermittent fasting, caloric restriction and exercise promote the growth of new brain cells for you. So keep that up too.
Blueberries (Photo: N K, Shutterstock / N K)
Everyone talks about enhancing BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) as a method of growing new brain cells and while that is still important, there is some new research that suggests that the hormone that makes you feel hungry, called ghrelin, may be the thing that triggers the whole birth of new neurons in the first place.
On the topic of exercise, I definitely want you to go to Body Pump and Zumba, but you should also be exercising your brain too. By that, engage in puzzles, math problems and spatial video games. This brings me to my next idea for you. How about playing Super Mario 3D?
This particular video game (and also Super Mario 64) have been used in two important research studies on the brain, where it was proven that spatial video games increase brain activity in the hippocampal region and help you create new neurons. This gives us a whole new perspective when it comes to healing the brain and growing new healthy brain cells.
So, try a big bowl of blueberries, a long workout, and then crash on the couch for some fun video gaming, and just feel your mind ignite with newfound brainiac-ness.

Britons tuned in in their millions — 24 million, to be specific — to watch England beat Colombia in the FIFA World Cup on Tuesday night. Among the fans were some rather high profile royals. So what was the royal family's reaction to England's World Cup win? Luckily we now have social media to tell us.
In case you missed it, the England versus Colombia game went into extra time and then penalties after the teams remained tied 1-1 after both the full and extra time whistles. Despite never previously winning a penalty shootout during the World Cup, the Three Lions went on to beat Columbia 4-3 on penalties, making history as well as securing a place in the World Cup quarter-finals.
So, were the royals all tuning in? It looks like some of them were. Following England's history-making win on Tuesday night, Kensington Palace tweeted a message that was attributed to the second-in-line-to-the-throne and President of The Football Association, Prince William immediately after England's win. So, it's nice to know our future monarch can get down for England alongside their future subjects.
According to the tweet, William said: “I couldn't be prouder of England, a victory in a penalty shootout! You have well and truly earned your place in the final eight of the World Cup and you should know the whole country is right behind you for Saturday! Come on England!”
So, what for the other Royals?
Well, it seems Princess Eugenie is definitely feeling the World Cup this year, even if she's not watching the England games in real time. The daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson sure wasn't alone in posting the hilarious Friends/"It's Coming Home" meme which is currently making the rounds across the social media pages of England's football fanbase, but I for one am glad they decided to join the ranks and post the meme, despite not sharing it with their followers until Wednesday morning.
I salute you and your A-grade football meme game, Eugenie.
With William and Eugenie pretty much confirming themselves as football fans — at least, during the England team's remaining time in the 2018 FIFA World Cup — it's only natural to speculate that if England were to progress, a Royal may fly to Russia to watch the team in the stadium. However, I wouldn't get your hopes up.
Indeed, it looks like England supporters probably won't see a member of the Royal Family cheering the England team on from the stands this World Cup, according to a report by Express.co.uk. Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told the newspaper in June that no matter how far England progresses in the tournament, the English Royal Family are unlikely be attending the FIFA World Cup this year, due to England and tournament host Russia's frosty AF relationship .
Fitzwilliams explained: “Relations between Britain and Russia have recently been at their worst since the Cold War and regardless of the progress of the England team I would not expect any Royal attendance.” The Future Engagements section of Royal Family's website does indeed list no intention on Prince William's part to attend any matches. Darn.

The England football team will take on Sweden in the quarter-final stage of the FIFA World Cup on Saturday. And, while a member of the Royal Family probably won't be there to cheer them on in person, they may be in one of the millions of England supporters expected to tune in from the comfort of their own homes.
Indeed, the BBC reports that 23.6 million households tuned into ITV on Tuesday to watch the England versus Columbia game, with ITV also confirming a record 3.3 million people watched online via the ITV Hub. So, however many viewers tune in on Saturday, I fully expect William, Eugenie and hopefully even more Royals to be among them.
England vs. Sweden airs at 3 p.m. on Saturday, July 7 on ITV

The 72-year-old mother of a Dunmore man accused of slashing a toddler with a knife will stand trial on charges they tried to cover it up.
Vita Forgione, 801 Brenda Lane, appeared Wednesday before Magisterial District Judge Sean P. McGraw on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing. The Carbondale-based magistrate ruled prosecutors presented enough evidence to send Forgione to trial on charges of tampering with evidence, unsworn falsification and failing to report child abuse as a mandated reporter.
Dunmore police arrested Forgione last month and said that they cleaned bloody sheets, deleted text messages and hid the knife authorities say their son, James Forgione, used to leave a 4-inch-long gash on their girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter's back. The wound cut down through to the child's muscle tissue required approximately 30 stitches to suture, the investigator, Detective Michael Lydon, testified.
“That laceration would have been caused with a very sharp object,” Lydon said
Them attorney, John Petorak, took issue with charge that they failed to report child abuse as a “mandated reporter,” which authorities brought forward because they said they were a teacher's aid with the Scranton School District. Petorak doesn't dispute that an education professional would be a mandated reporter but that does not mean they are legally obligated to report suspected abuse outside the scope of their employment, they said.
“(Forgione) is not a blood relative, they are not mandated to report in this circumstance,” Petorak said.
Assistant District Attorney Jamie Davis argued that, while Forgione might not have been the child's primary or secondary caregiver, they the abuse occurred in their home and they took care of the toddler.
“There's enough evidence to suggest (Forgione) is responsible for the child,” Davis said.
Earlier this month, a district judge held James Forgione, 36,
for trial on charges of aggravated assault and child endangerment and the toddler's mother, Sherrise Zangardi, 33, had waived their right to a preliminary hearing April 26.
On April 17, Zangardi brought their daughter to Moses Taylor Hospital, though authorities later learned they had waited 7½ hours to do so. Police charged them first and then James Forgione four days later once the child told investigators that they had cut them with a knife.
Lydon testified that Vita Forgione spoke with James Forgione at the Lackawanna County Prison and obtained tapes of their conversation.
“I cleaned the rooms and I put the stuff away,” Vita Forgione said in an April 21 phone call, according to a police affidavit.
“I deleted everything from you (James Forgione) and their (Sherrise Zangardi) so everything was deleted, so that's all done,” they said later in the call.
Lydon interviewed them not long after.
“I wanted to provide (Vita Forgione) with the chance to be honest with me,” the detective testified.
Confronted with the tapes, they admitted they took a knife from the basement and hid it in their dresser before police could serve a search warrant.
Vita Forgione remains free on bail.

While a quick run around would tire many adults out, children seem to have endless bags of energy.
Now, a new study suggests that kids may actually be as fit as professional endurance athletes.
Researchers from the Université Clermont Auvergne found that children not only have fatigue-resistant muscles, but also recover very quickly from high-intensity exercise.
Dr Sébastien Ratel, who led the study, said: “During many physical tasks, children might tire earlier than adults because they have limited cardiovascular capability, tend to adopt less-efficient movement patterns and need to take more steps to move a given distance.
(Image: REUTERS)
“Our research shows children have overcome some of these limitations through the development of fatigue-resistant muscles and the ability to recover very quickly from high-intensity exercise.”
In the study, the researchers asked three groups - 8-12 year old boys, untrained adults and endurance athletes - to perform cycling tasks.
During the tasks, the researchers assessed how each participant's body produced energy - both aerobically (using oxygen from blood) and anaerobically (not using oxygen).
The participants' heart-rate, oxygen levels and lactate-removal rates were checked after the cycling tasks to see how quickly they recovered.

Results revealed that in all tests, the children outperformed the untrained adults.
Dr Ratel said: "We found the children used more of their aerobic metabolism and were therefore less tired during the high-intensity physical activities.
“They also recovered very quickly - even faster than the well-trained adult endurance athletes - as demonstrated by their faster heart-rate recovery and ability to remove blood lactate.
"This may explain why children seem to have the ability to play and play and play, long after adults have become tired.”
The researchers suggest the findings could help develop athletic potential in children.
Dr Ratel said: “Many parents ask about the best way to develop their child's athletic potential.
“Our study shows that muscle endurance is often very good in children, so it might be better to focus on other areas of fitness such as their sports technique, sprint speed or muscle strength.

“This may help to optimize physical training in children, so that they perform better and enjoy sports more.”
The findings could also help to improve our understanding of how our bodies change from childhood to adulthood.
Dr Ratel added: “With the rise in diseases related to physical inactivity, it is helpful to understand the physiological changes with growth that might contribute to the risk of disease.
“Our research indicates that aerobic fitness, at least at the muscle level, decreases significantly as children move into adulthood - which is around the time increases in diseases such as diabetes occur.
"It will be interested in future research to determine whether the muscular changes we have observed are directly related to disease risk.
“At least, our results might provide motivation for practitioners to maintain muscle fitness as children grow up; it seems that being a child might be healthy for us.”
NAIG COMMENTS ON IOWA CROP PROGRESS AND CONDITION REPORT
DES MOINES – Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig today commented on the Iowa Crop Progress and Condition report released by the USDA National Agricultural Statistical Service. The report is released weekly from April through November.
“The warm, dry weather allowed many farmers to make significant progress and now 96 percent of corn and 81 percent of soybeans have been planted, which is on pace or slightly ahead of the five-year average. The high temperatures have created some stress for livestock and farmers have been working hard to provide plenty of water and make sure their animals are as comfortable as possible,” Naig said.
The weekly report is also available on the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship's website at www.IowaAgriculture.gov or on USDA's site at www.nass.usda.gov/ia. The report summary follows here:
CROP REPORT
A hot and dry week across much of the State allowed Iowa farmers 5.1 days suitable for fieldwork during the week ending May 27, 2018, according to the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service.
Topsoil moisture levels rated 3 percent very short, 12 percent short, 77 percent adequate and 8 percent surplus. Subsoil moisture levels rated 5 percent very short, 12 percent short, 74 percent adequate and 9 percent surplus. South central Iowa continues to struggle with subsoil moisture supply availability with three-quarters rated short to very short.
Iowa growers have planted 96 percent of the expected corn crop, with 77 percent of the crop emerged. Farmers in the northern one-third of the state were able to plant over 20 percent of their corn during the previous week which leaves less than 10 percent still to be planted. Soybean growers have 81 percent of the expected crop planted, a week ahead of the 5-year average. Forty-four percent of soybeans have emerged, three days ahead of last year. Nearly all the expected oat crop has been planted, 1-week behind average. Ninety-five percent of the crop has emerged, 2 days behind last year. Four percent of the oat crop has headed, 4 days behind both last year and the average.
Hay conditions improved slightly to 65 percent good to excellent. Pasture conditions also improved to 60 percent good to excellent. Warm temperatures and improved soil moisture levels strongly supported pasture and hay growth. Extreme temperatures resulted in reports of heat stress in cattle herds.

Minnesota's Senate signed off on $10 million in emergency funding to fix the state's troubled new driver's registration system.
The Senate approved a bill Monday to fund repairs to the new platform known as MNLARS on a 47-20 vote. It also includes some new oversight measures like a legislative commission that Republicans deemed essential to ensuring the system is fixed.
It comes more than two weeks after the state started sending out layoff notices to information technology contractors working on MNLARS. And there's no promise of a speedy resolution with the House, which has laid out a drastically different plan to fund the fixes.
Sen. Scott Newman chairs the Senate's Transportation Committee. Newman says he's confident the two sides can come to a quick agreement.
Shaikh Saif also said 2017 will see the beginning of a new system of review of office-bearers, including ministers. Instead of a performance review every five or three years only, they will be reviewed every three months. “With the speed of UAE's development, we are not riding a fast train, we are riding an airplane,” they said.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Wisconsin first-year student guard Kobe King is having season-ending surgery on their injured left knee.
The University of Wisconsin sports medicine staff said that surgery was taking place Monday. King is a promising first-year student who appeared in each of the first 10 games this season, averaging 5.2 points. Wisconsin says they are eligible to apply for a medical redshirt.
Sophomore guard D'Mitrik Trice was also set for surgery on their injured right foot and won't begin rehab for at least two weeks. Trice is averaging 9.4 points and playing a team-high 31.5 minutes a game.
Wisconsin is 4-7 after an 82-63 loss to Marquette on Saturday.

A man has been jailed after a court case collapsed due to chilling threats made to the alleged victim in a YouTube video.
Peter Connor uploaded a video titled 'Traveller's Biggest Grass' in which the man was called a 'squealer' and told they would be beaten 'from one end of England to the other'.
Connor, of Millers Lane, Wigan, has now been jailed for 18 months after their trial heard that the alleged victim had fled the country.
Derby Crown Court heard how Patrick Hanrahan had been 'stabbed multiple times' at a travellers site in the city in 2015, the Manchester Evening News reports.

Driver ploughs into pedestrians in World Cup host city killing one and injuring six 'after falling asleep at the wheel'
Three men were due to face trial for wounding with intent but the trial collapsed when Mr Hanrahan left the country, fearful for their safety after violent threats were made in the footage posted online.
Mr Hanrahan fled the country and disappeared, causing the trial against the trio to collapse.
Now Connor has been jailed after pleading guilty to witness intimidation.
Judge Jonathan Bennett said: “Patrick Hanrahan was stabbed multiple times in the Derby area.
“He became a reluctant witness, fleeing the UK.
“You were involved in a short video which I have had the opportunity to see.
“It was a frightening video in which you threatened to ‘beat them from one end of the UK to the other' if they returned.
“He was told they were ‘a squealer' and told they would be shut up if they came back.
“He moved away for their own safety and one factor, quite clearly, will have been this video.
(Image: Derby Telegraph/BPM Media)
“Anything that interferes with the criminal justice system is taken extremely seriously.”
Katrina Wilson, prosecuting, said three men were due to face trail for wounding with intent after Mr Hanrahan was stabbed a number of times at a travellers site in Derby in 2015.
They said: “He left the UK in a bid to distance themselves from those involved in the assault.
“This video was uploaded later in which they are called a ‘squealer,' that they will be shot and ‘beaten from one end of the UK'.
“He was scared people were looking for them and since then they cannot be traced.
“As a result of this, the prosecution had no alternative than to offer no evidence and the case was dropped.”
Miss Wilson said police received evidence that Connor had been involved in uploading the video and they were arrested.

They said in their interview they answered 'no comment' to the questions they were asked.
Patrick Buckley, for Connor, said their client has spent almost a year on a tagged curfew since they were arrested and charged with this offence.
They said: “I do accept on their behalf that this crosses the custodial threshold because matters of this type ultimately strike at the heart of the justice system.”
The discovery in Edinburg, Texas comes more than three weeks after 10 people died and several others were rescued from a sweltering rig parked at a Walmart in San Antonio. A memorial for the San Antonio incident is shown here. ( Eric Gay / The Associated Press file photo )
EDINBURG, TEXAS—Police in Texas acting on a tip found 17 immigrants locked inside a tractor-trailer parked at a gas station about 30 kilometres from the border with Mexico. Edinburg assistant police chief Oscar Trevino tells KGBT-TV that the immigrants from Mexico, Honduras and other countries may have been locked inside the 18-wheeler for at least eight hours before being freed by officers in Edinburg late Sunday morning. None of the people inside the tractor-trailer required medical attention. A man and woman who Trevino said are Cuban nationals were in charge of the rig and have been detained. Edinburg police went to the gas station, a popular stopover for commercial truck drivers travelling through the region, after receiving an anonymous call from someone saying a relative was trapped inside the tractor-trailer with several others.

Officers began knocking on the sides of trailers parked at the station and eventually received return knocks from the one holding the immigrants, police said. A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the agency is investigating the matter.
The discovery comes more than three weeks after 10 people died and several others were rescued from a sweltering rig parked at a Walmart in San Antonio. At least a dozen others were hospitalized. The driver of that rig remains in federal custody, charged with illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death. The San Antonio incident demonstrated how smugglers regularly use big rigs as part of an elaborate network of foot guides, safe house operators and drivers. The immigrants discovered in San Antonio had been divided into groups and marked with colour-coded tape. Six black SUVs were waiting at one transit point to take some on to their destinations. Authorities have not said if similar arrangements had been made for the immigrants found in Edinburg, about 370 kilometres south of San Antonio. Tractor-trailers emerged as a popular smuggling method in the early 1990s amid a surge in U.S. border enforcement in San Diego and El Paso, Texas, which were then the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. Before that, people paid small fees to mom-and-pop operators to get them across a largely unguarded border. As crossing became exponentially more difficult after the 2001 terror strikes in the U.S., migrants were led through more dangerous terrain and paid thousands of dollars more.

It seems like Gambit may have finally found it's director — again. According to multiple reports, director of the first three Pirates of the Caribbean films, Gore Verbinski, is set to direct the X-Men spin-off.
The card-throwing mutant flick, which is being produced by Channing Tatum and Simon Kinberg, has been in creative limbo for a while and Verbinski is the third director who agreed to take on the project. It started with Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt back in 2015. Following their exit, Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman signed on, but quickly stepped down in 2016 over the script — citing their lack of connection and inability to connect with Gambit.
[Credit: Marvel Comics]
Tatum will pull double duty as he's also set to star as Remy LeBeau, the mutant Gambit. LeBeau is a master thief with a southern-charm and distinct Cajun accent hailing from New Orleans. Their abilities allow them to channel kinetic energy into inanimate objects.
With Verbinski now onboard, maybe we can finally get Gambit off the ground. Thanks to the success of Deadpool and Logan, there's hope that #Gambit could be the next X-men spin-off to make waves for Fox.
Are you still exited about the prospect of Gambit on the big screen? Or has too much time passed? Leave a comment down below.

This week Madi made the big schlep to a place in Mahikeng where every shopping bag is called a "Checkers".
Madi felt like Mary Tyler Moore in their convertible with the wind in their hair, except they couldn't let their chiffon scarf go flying as it was Hermes. Several hours Madi made it safely to Mmabatho Stadium for the annual Maftown Heights event .
There was huge pandemonium about Maftown Heights finally "coming back home", which did not make any sense to Maditaba.
If "home" is 95 hours away with scorching heat and grazing cows for scenery, Madi would like to say thanks, but no thanks.
The place was more packed than a Tekkies store in Brits having a clearance sale. Bathong, Bonang Matheba and AKA were there.
Madi was not impressed with Bonang's outfit. They looked like those teachers back in the day with a "Sales House" wardrobe.
Madi found the outfit patronising, almost like they couldn't be bothered to put in some effort because it was Mahikeng.
No girl. You are Bonang Matheba. Be on point or don't show up at all.
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, US has much more to do than hosting space missions to explore life outside Earth. It is also tracking the early history of Earth's life, beginning from 100 million years ago.
A sandstone slab excavated from the Goddard Space Flight Center in 2012 holds footprints of at least 70 mammal and dinosaurs. According to a paper published on January 31 in the journal Scientific Reports, the sandstone footprints might be at least 100 million years old and hold the clue that mammals and dinosaurs were indeed interacting.
Ray Stanford, a local dinosaur track expert had accidentally discovered the dinosaur track in the dining room table-sized rock in 2012 while returning after dropping their wife, Sheila at their office in Goddard center. They found the 12-inch-wide dinosaur track in the exposed rock behind Sheila's office. The follow-up excavation and studies have identified more preserved tracks from the dinosaur era.
The 8 feet by 3 feet specimen had imprints from eight species, including squirrel-sized mammals and tank-sized dinosaurs. Experts suggest that the tracks might have formed within few days in the edge of a wetland region. It could even belong to a predator and its prey.
Martin Lockley, a palaeontologist with the University of Colorado, Denver and a co-author of the paper, said, "The concentration of mammal tracks on this site is orders of magnitude higher than any other site in the world. I don't think I've even seen a slab this size, which is a couple of square meters, where you have over 70 footprints of so many different types. This is the mother lode of Cretaceous mammal tracks."
Stephen J. Godfrey, curator of palaeontology at the Calvert Marine Museum, coordinated the excavation of the slab and creation of the mould and cast for the scientific study.
The tracks of a tank-sized nodosaur and baby nodosaur found near and within the adult's footprint indicate that they were walking together. Other dinosaurs like long-necked plant eater sauropod, small, crow-sized carnivorous dinosaur theropods, and flying reptile pterosaurs had punched their imprints in the fossil rock.
The region is believed to be one of the two sites in the world found with the largest concentration of prints. The slab stores the largest mammal track ever discovered from the Cretaceous period which is of about four square inch size. At least 26 mammal footprints were discovered in the stone since 2012.
Stanford said, "It's a time machine. We can look across a few days of activity of these animals and we can picture it. We see the interaction of how they pass in relation to each other. This enables us to look deeply into ancient times on Earth. It's just tremendously exciting."
Wider diversity and number of tracks indicate that these animals fed from the region at the same time. Mammals which fed on worms and grubs might have been eaten by small carnivorous dinosaurs. Pterosaurs, the larger carnivore dinosaur, could have actively hunted on the mammals and small dinosaurs. The parallel footprint patterns of four crow-sized carnivores give hints of a hunting group.
The researchers also identified mammal tracks in pairs which indicate that they stopped to sit on their haunches. This sitting pattern from Goddard Space Flight Center has been named as "Sederipes goddardensis".
Scientists believe that Maryland supported large varieties of life during the Cretaceous era due to its hotter, swampier topography. The scientists continue with their study to compare the tracks with others found around the globe for more discoveries on prehistoric life.
FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WOWO): More than 50 people gathered for a candlelight vigil held yesterday in memory of a 2-year-old that was allegedly beaten to death by their mother's boyfriend two weeks ago.
Malakai Garrett was the 36th homicide of the year in Allen County when they died at a Fort Wayne hospital on November 29th. He'd suffered severe internal injuries consistent with that of a beating, and 27-year-old Mitchell Vanryn has since been charged with murder.

“A little bit of peace. To know that we can come together as a community,” Meuter says.” And for us, as a Christian church to tell them that Malakai is in Jesus' arms, that's very important for us to be able to say.”
Car decals and bracelets with the words “Justice for Malakai” on them were sold at the event, with the proceeds going to cover funeral expenses.
Crop-Destroying Birds Better Prey These Falcons Don't See Them

It's feeding time at Brad Felger's farm in Washington's Skagit Valley. And he's about to feed 40 hungry falcons.
Yes, falcons.
They're an important, albeit often unseen, part of farming in some states, used as a defense mechanism to keep away pesky birds like starlings, which love to eat berries and apples.
Since age 12, Felger has had a self-described love for everything with feathers, scales or tails.
"Falconers are, what's the word I'm looking for ... eccentric," Felger says.
Now they run Airstrike Bird Control as founder and CEO.
Their business? Raptor abatement.
It's different than traditional falconry because rather than hunting quarry, they use their falcons to scare off birds that can be bad news for crops.
In 2017, they employed about 30 falconers and used over 100 falcons (only about 25 of those are Felger's) to control troublesome crop-eaters.
According to research in the journal Crop Protection, in 2011 in Washington state alone, honeycrisp apple farmers lost nearly $3,000 per acre to birds eating their produce.
While nets can secure fruit trees and noisemakers can scare birds, there are drawbacks to each tool. Nets can be expensive, and birds can get used to noise-scare tactics.
But falcons?
"It's using nature against nature. And it's something birds never get used to," Felger says. "They never get used to an aggressive falcon flying toward them."

Felger's operation is non-lethal for the birds that the falcons scare away.
They fly their falcons all along the U.S. West Coast. In Washington, they start with blueberry farms in May, then travels east, ending with vineyards in the Yakima Valley and Columbia Basin through the fall.
Their operation is gaining popularity, especially with organic and eco-friendly farms.
Patricia Thompson is the falconry manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. This season they permitted nearly 300 recreational falconers in the state. Thompson says she's noticed an uptick in this style of pest control.
"It feels like more people are getting into abatement falconry," Thompson said. "And it does seem to be more ecological to haze the birds off, rather than using pesticides."
Thompson isn't sure how many of those falconers practice abatement since the state doesn't offer those permits. That permit comes at the federal level through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
All states except Hawaii allow falconry. In other states, abatement falconers also work with landfill sites, golf courses and warehouses where birds can be a nuisance.
Thompson is quick to point out how intense falconry can be. It starts with a two-year apprenticeship, followed by an exam, and even a site visit where wildlife department officials examine facilities. They call it a real lifestyle because the birds take so much time to care for and are in hunting-working relationships with their falconers.
At Fegler's farm, breeding season has already started. Next month, Felger is hoping to add 40 baby falcons to their cast of the hardworking birds of prey. Soon these little birds will start training to become the next generation of fruit-saving predators, maybe protecting a blueberry field or apple orchard near you.

This was the remarkable moment traffic on a busy motorway was brought to a standstill by a flock of sheep.
Police and highways officers were called to the M62 near Huddersfield at around midnight last night.
Traffic was stopped in both directions as they attempted to remove the woolly intruders.
It didn't take them long to round up the sheep and return them to a nearby field from which they had strayed.
Twitter was quick to see the funny side of the incident, with one wag joking 'gives a whole new meaning to shoulder of lamb'.
Leamington will kick off their 2018/19 National League North campaign with a trip to newly promoted Altrincham on August 4.
It is one of seven games in a busy first month for Paul Holleran's side, with Boston United the first visitors to the Phillips 66 Community Stadium the following Tuesday.
The trip to York City, scene of last season's survival celebration, comes on November 10, while Boxing Day will see a visit to Brackley, with the return fixture on New Year's Day.
Supporters will have to wait until March 9 for the eagerly anticipated trip to Chester City, while the season concludes on April 27 with an away fixture at Darlington.

Fixtures are subject to change.
It's getting a lot less coverage than other PC commitments , but Brown would rip up Ontario's existing cap and trade program. The Tories would replace it with a carbon tax of their own — as required by a federal “backstop” law — that would end up pushing fuel prices significantly higher (albeit rebated via income tax cuts and child care credits promised elsewhere in their platform).
Underpinning the platform is a promise to deliver kinder, gentler, more reassuring regime change. And on the surface, it succeeds — by pledging to (more or less) stick with Liberal commitments on pharmacare, rent controls and minimum wages (albeit more slowly).
That's the subliminal message emanating from Patrick Brown's Progressive Conservatives as they push out a new campaign platform officially called “People's Guarantee.” Guaranteed not to rattle you.
Environmental experts have been debating the relative benefits of rival systems for a decade, which is one reason Ontario took so long to make up its own mind. Last year, after years of foot-dragging, the province finally followed the lead of California and Quebec by linking up with their tried-and-tested cap and trade system.
Such a switch, from cap and trade to carbon tax, has never before been successfully attempted, as Ontario's independent environmental commissioner, Dianne Saxe, pointed out to me in my weekend column . So why would Brown bother with an untried and unproven changeover at this stage of the game?
No loony-left idea, it had been shepherded by the state's then-governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger (a Republican) and Quebec's then-premier Jean Charest (like Brown, a former federal Tory). Why do Brown's Progressive Conservatives believe a system favoured by fellow right-wingers is so wrongheaded?
The PCs are ostensibly opposed to what the Ontario government does with money raised from carbon emitters. In their People's Guarantee platform, the Tories cheekily dub it the “Liberal Cap-and-Trade Slush Fund,” brimming with billions of dollars paid by polluters.
Brown claims that the money is being squandered by the Liberals on patronage pals and pet projects. In fact, the spending is being scrutinized by the environmental commissioner and is allocated to mundane projects such as rapid transit, energy retrofits and bike lanes.
The PC platform document complains that “the Liberals . . . only seem to care about the growing yet still small share of the population who take public transit.” But even if Tories doubt the merits of funding bike lanes or mass transit, there is a simpler way for them to cut that “Liberal Cap-and-Trade Slush Fund” down to size.
Brown could simply rebate those cap and trade billions directly to taxpayers by making the system “revenue neutral” — just like their proposed carbon tax. In other words (and numbers), they could still take the money from polluters as the province does today, but without investing in supposedly suspect environmental measures — instead “using all the cap and trade revenues to finance tax cuts,” as Jack Gibbons, head of the Ontario Clean Air Alliance, says.
The appeal of their alternative carbon tax, according to Ontario's PCs, is that the money will go straight back to voters through tax cuts. But there is nothing necessarily neutral about carbon tax revenues, as B.C. has just demonstrated: That province's new NDP government has announced that proceeds from the carbon tax will now be invested in environmental projects to fight global warming — just like Ontario's cap and trade regime.
So if the existing Ontario Liberal system can be made revenue neutral with a change in government, and the proposed PC carbon tax can be switched to a so-called slush fund on a whim, why bother switching systems at all? More to the point, given that many industries support a price on carbon as long as it is clear and certain, why create uncertainty by changing systems in mid-stream?
Comparing the rival systems this month, Dave Sawyer of EnviroEconomics noted that “on emission reductions, the cap and trade scenario outperforms the carbon tax scenario.” All this back and forth comes at a cost because “the downside is this policy lurching will erode confidence and expectations in carbon pricing, which undermines the price signal.”
It would also be costly to change midway through. Brown's platform has budgeted $1.5 billion for “transitioning away from cap-and-trade and into a carbon pricing system,” noting that a PC government will “ensure that businesses are kept whole.”
Cap and trade is so difficult to understand that it's hard to love, but it's commendably flexible. A carbon tax, simple as it sounds, can be unhelpfully rigid in a mixed economy like ours, the environmental commissioner says.
Oddly, Brown's Tories denounced a carbon tax for years, but have belatedly embraced it. Is this change for climate change's sake, or merely for the sake of regime change?

IFC is planning to invest $20 million in the third private equity fund of Lighthouse. Photo: Reuters
New Delhi: International Finance Corp. (IFC), a part of the World Bank Group, and its asset management arm plan to invest $45 million in Lighthouse, a private equity firm focused on growth investments in India's consumer sector.
IFC is planning to invest $20 million in the third private equity fund of Lighthouse, while the asset management arm of IFC is also considering a parallel investment of $25 million in the fund. “Lighthouse has received a commitment of $20 million for its third private equity fund, Lighthouse India Fund III. Additionally, IFC's AMC is also considering a parallel investment of $25 million in the fund, which will bring the total investment by the IFC group to $45 million,” the PE firm said in a release.
Lighthouse India Fund III is a $200 million private equity fund, two-third of which has already been committed to by global marquee institutional investors, the release said. In 2017, Lighthouse invested Rs51 crore in Stylam Industries and Rs44 crore in Wow! Momos. In October this year, the firm invested Rs76 crore in V2 Retail, and has a few more deals in the pipeline for early next year.
“Lighthouse has returned 1.7 times of the invested capital on its first fund, with four more exits to go,” the statement added. The firm's current and past investments include Bikaji Foods, Capital Trust, Cera Sanitaryware, Dhanuka Agritech, FabIndia Overseas, Kama Ayurveda, Suraksha Diagnostic, Unibic Foods and XSEED Education.

Decision time is looming on Brexit.
After months of dithering, delay and obfuscation, the Prime Minister can no longer kick the can down the road.
Theresa May has to spell out how they will resolve the Irish border question.
And that hinges on what sort of customs system we put in place after we leave the EU.
The Prime Minister faces a week of fresh parliamentary battles as clashes centred on staying in a customs union with the EU continue to dog the Government.
Here is why the customs union has become the make-or-break issue for Brexit .
What is the customs union?
(Image: PA)
The European Union operates as a customs union. This means the 28 member states can trade freely with each other without any checks or duties on goods.
It also means all the countries in the EU set the same tariffs on imports from non-EU countries.
For example, car imports from the US to the EU carry a 10% tariff, while South Africa has to pay up to 16% on the oranges which it exports to the EU.
Why is this such a headache for the Government?
(Image: PA)
Being in the customs union benefits the UK as the EU is our largest trading partner.
It means firms can move goods and components within the EU without any duties or cumbersome checks at borders.
Lorries can pass freely between Dover and Calais, while South Korean goods in a container unloaded at Rotterdam, for instance, can then be distributed throughout the EU without any further checks.
Despite these advantages, Theresa May wants the UK to leave the customs union.
They argue that if we remain members it means accepting Brussels' rules without any say on them and we would be prevented from striking our own deals with non-EU countries – one of the main benefits of leaving the EU.
Why is the Irish border so important?
(Image: AFP)
The EU and UK have agreed that after Brexit there can be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which is in the EU.
Remainers argue the only way to prevent having checks and infrastructure on the border is to stay in the customs union.
Mrs May has agreed with the EU that if no other workable solution can be found then Northern Ireland will stay in the customs union.
Does Theresa May have a solution?
(Image: Getty Images Europe)
The Prime Minister is looking at two options. The first is a “customs partnership” with the EU.
This would see Britain collect tariffs on all imports on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, then firms would be able to reclaim the difference.
The second option is a customs arrangement known as “max fac” or maximum facilitation.
This would use high-tech tracking devices to monitor the flow of goods. Businesses would operate as “trusted traders” and would be able to pay any tariffs at regular intervals rather than every time they cross a border.
What is likely to happen?
(Image: Jack Taylor)
The problem for Mrs May is the EU has so far rejected both their preferred options. And without a solution, Northern Ireland will remain in the customs union.
Brexiteers believe Brussels is being deliberately uncooperative to snare us into staying in the EU.
poll loading Should Britain stay in the EU Customs Union after Brexit? 500+ VOTES SO FAR No Yes
To add to the Prime Minister's difficulties, next month MPs will vote on whether to stay in the customs union.
If enough Tory rebels join Labour, then Mrs May's Brexit plans would be holed below the water.
Mrs May could accept a limited membership of a customs union, but this would split the Tory Party and spark Cabinet resignations.
Or they could walk away without a deal – but that would be economically calamitous.
"Staying in the customs union is the worst of both worlds" Tory MP Bernard Jenkin The British people voted to take back control – including over our trade agreements. Some MPs want Parliament to reverse key aspects of the referendum. This is pretty outrageous! Today, the EU sets the product standards of everything you can buy in our country. And everything made in Britain. They set the tariffs on imports to the UK. If we stay in any kind of customs union with the EU, then the UK still be a “rule taker” of the EU. Except it would be worse than now. We would no longer have a say over new rules. The EU would also make us keep paying into the EU budget as now. And abandon plans to control EU immigration. In the referendum it was made clear we would have to leave the single market. Instead we can trade with the rest of the world. Australia has made it clear it is keen to pursue a trade agreement with the UK, but this is not possible if we rejoin the customs union. Despite being in the EU, our trade with the EU has been going down for the past decade. UK trade with the rest of the world is going up, despite the trade barriers. Staying in the customs' union is the worst of both worlds. Still bound by EU rules, but no say over them. Maybe that's where the EU wants us to be.

When it comes to the likes of celebrity skincare routines, one can assume that their bathroom cabinets are stuffed with the most luxurious of options, where caviar face creams and diamond dust setting powders are the norm. But every now and again, they surprise us with an affordable curve ball. Rihanna's favorite body cream is only $12, meaning you don't have to spend a lot to get your skin glowing.
Seeing how the Grammy winner turned beauty mogul is the creative brains behind Fenty Beauty — which has brought as landmark cosmetic moments like turning 40 shades of foundation into the new collection standard, or reviving the glitter lotion from our junior high days — we trust them when it comes to beauty. So when Rihanna has a favorite go-to product, one can only assume the stuff really works.
The body cream in question is Weleda Skin Food Cream, and according to InStyle, Rihanna likes to put it on before getting their nails done, so their hands and feet are as smooth and nail art ready as possible.
Weleda is an all-natural beauty brand that skips the toxic chemicals and instead uses flower, fruit and root extracts, minerals, and essential oils to get your skin glowing. And they have been around for a while — the brand has been formulating skincare since 1921!
Their particular "Skin Food" cream that Ri is a fan of is formulated especially for dry, rough skin, making it a thick lotion that smooths on like butter. It's meant to be their "best beauty secret," and they have been selling it since 1926, so the formula has clearly stood the test of time.
With extracts of calendula and chamomile mixed into a rich base of oils and beeswax, it's extremely nourishing and can be used on everything from your hands and feet, to your elbows and face.
And even more interesting, this all-purpose cream has more uses than just being used as a nourishing lotion. You can apply it as a face mask for 10 minutes, and then wash it off with a warm face cloth to restore a natural glow. You can tap it on lightly as a natural highlighter, run it through curly and kinky hair for a boost in hydration, or rub it into split ends to add some moisture, and even dab it onto chapped lips. Whatever ailment you have, this affordable bottle will fix.
But Rihanna isn't the only celeb that swears by it. It turns out that the affordable tube has a long list of celebrity fans who can't get enough of its nourishing properties.
Julia Roberts uses it religiously, where they can't help but use it all over their body. "I put it on my hands after I wash the dishes, and wind up putting it on my elbows and feet," they told InStyle. "Before you know it, I've squeezed this poor little green tube into a twist."
Rosie Huntington-Whitely shared an Instagram story of their vanity table earlier this year, where a well-used bottle was scrunched up next to their rose gold eyeshadow palettes.
Even Whitney Port, former The Hills star and fashion icon of our Noughties wardrobes, swears by the stuff, sharing that it's their go-to nigh tcream. Why buy a jar for $60 when you can just get an all-purpose cream for 12 bucks that works just as well? "I love Weleda Skin Food, I just use it on my face at nighttime and wake up glowing," Port told Well and Good.
If you're looking for an affordable addition to your skincare routine, this lotion is a great option!

The venue that helped arrange the wedding of a man dying from cancer is now asking for your help.
Staff at Longwell Green Community Centre helped organise and host the wedding of Jason Pimm, who is battling terminal cancer, and their partner Louise Holbrook.
The couple had visited the centre in July to arrange a party for Jason's 46 birthday party, but within days that had decided to get married and arranged a wedding.
Centre manager Alison Jordan and food and beverage manager Scott Janes helped organise the event and set up a JustGiving page to cover the costs.
Now, after the “perfect wedding” was held on July 22, the community centre staff are asking for your help to win £25,000 to transform the centre.
Ms Jordan said: “It's been a whirlwind. It started with the wedding but this is totally a shock to me.
“It was a local resident that nominated us. This person had be supporting the wedding and our social group.
“For us it would literally transform the building. It would put us out there. There's so much we need to do here. Our water and electric supplies need updating. It all needs maintenance.”

The community centre in Shellards Road has been nominated for a community award from the OneFamily Foundation.
If the community centre wins the public vote, it could win £25,000 to fund the Stand Up Reach Out social group to tackle social isolation.
The money would also transform the centre by helping to improve, maintain and expand the services and facilities.
Ms Jordan added: “We can expand ourselves so much. This really would be the floodgates to us being a fully functioning community centre.”
The vote opened this week and closes on Wednesday September 6.

Michael Buble's wife Luisana Lopilato is reportedly pregnant with the couple's third child.
The 30-year-old model and actor is allegedly two and a half months into their third pregnancy, according to Argentinian journalist Laura Ufbal, and the pair are reported to be planning to tell their families next month.
Michael, 42, and Luisana already have sons Noah, four, and Elias, two, together.
Luisana's actor brother Dario recently laughed nervously and stumbled over their words when they were asked about the news during a recent TV interview.
They said: "I wouldn't be able to tell you... I swear the truth is I couldn't tell because I don't, I don't, I don't know.
"When it comes to thinking about [names], I prefer it to be something specific because you begin to get excited. So I really couldn't tell you."
And Luisana has recently admitted they would love to expand their brood with Michael.
They said: "I would love to have another child because being a mother is the best role. I would love to have 20 children but my body wouldn't be up to it."
Noah was diagnosed with cancer in 2016 but Michael has revealed that the child is "progressing well" following their treatment.
Speaking previously, the Canadian vocalist said: "We are so grateful to report that our son Noah has been progressing well during their treatment and the doctors are very optimistic about the future for our little boy.

Katona: The Layered Leaf Lasagne is something I make at least once a week. There is nothing I love more than a dish that uses up leftovers. This uses up leftover rice, it uses up geriatric and limp cabbage, it even uses up your leftover mince in whatever form you left it to fester in the fridge — bolognaise, chill, keema. This is frugality on speed. This calls out to the camel in a sandstorm Indian in me. And the resulting dish is spectacular. It slices into big generous cubes and the strata of ingredients sit like geological magic. Actually, there isn't even a photo of it in the book — it looks like one of those unloved recipes an author includes as a filler, which is totally not true by the way, each dish costs an arm and a leg to shoot and each one had its own wardrobe of plates, material, cutlery, lights and each one was at least three hours in photographing, much longer than it took to cook any of them!
THE SECOND longest avenue of limes in the UK has emerged as the next likely battleground in Sheffield's campaign to cull hundreds of roadside trees.
The council's roads maintenance contractor, Amey, is locked in dispute with communities across the city over its plans to fell trees on scores of leafy roads.
The controversy came to national prominence in November when a convoy of tree surgeons escorted by police arrived at Rustlings Road, in the leafy suburb of Endcliffe, in a dawn raid compared by local MP and former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg to “something you'd expect to see in Putin's Russia”.
Two pensioners were arrested in the subsequent protests and the council later apologised, promising not to employ the same tactics again.
But the dispute is far from over, with residents living near a range of other threatened trees saying they were still concerned they would be woken by the sound of chainsaws.
Rivelin Valley Road is different from many other streets involved in the controversy because, apart from its first 100 metres, it is not a residential area.
When the road was built in 1907 by the local water company it was lined for three-and-a-half miles by 700 lime trees which are now said to form the second longest avenue in the UK, after one in Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire.
A total of 31 trees are threatened as part of the city's ongoing tree-felling programme, most now adorned with yellow ribbons and “save me” messages placed by campaigners who believe they are only being targeted to make Amey's road resurfacing work easier and cheaper.
Local protester Rebecca Hammond said that the plan, if it went ahead, would create two clear gaps in the avenue.
Ms Hammond said: “The visual impact will be humongous.”
They said local people had been told that most of the trees would be felled because the roots may be damaged when the road was resurfaced.
“That's a bit like saying I might graze my finger and it might go septic so I'm going to amputate my hand now. That's lazy and unacceptable,” Ms Hammond said.
The dispute has its roots in a 25-year-private finance initiative, reported to be worth £2bn, which the council signed with Amey in 2009. It includes a huge ongoing programme to resurface thousands of miles of Sheffield's pothole-ridden roads.
People living near Rivelin Valley Road are awaiting a report from an independent panel on the future of the trees.
Yesterday afternoon, as Justin Thomas was preparing to close out their first major victory, Frenchman Robin Sciot-Siegrist was winning the Northern Ireland Open.
Watching them do it was Niall Horan, one-fifth of all-conquering boy band One Direction and arguably the biggest thing to happen to golf since Tiger Woods.
Yeah, that's right. You read correctly.
Golf-obsessed Niall is only 23, reportedly plays off a single figure handicap and, with their band on an indeterminate hiatus, they have juggled pursuing a solo music career with a foray into the golf industry.
In February last year, it was reported that they were launching their own golf management company, Modest! Golf. Within months, the company partnered with the Northern Ireland Open, a relatively recent addition to the Challenge Tour schedule. With Horan in attendance, over 39,000 people flocked to Galgorm Castle GC in Ballymena for the event.
That's a bigger crowd than many full European Tour events command.
Horan's popularity is their currency. They have 32.3million Twitter followers. That's more than five times as many as Tiger Woods, the most followed golfer on the social media platform. You could pool the followers from the ten most followed golfers on Twitter and still not get more than two-thirds of the way to emulating Niall – and that's not accounting for duplicate followers.
On Instagram, they have nearly 20million followers. A picture they uploaded from the Northern Ireland Open Pro-Am last week has already been liked by almost 600,000 people.
Their Facebook page has more than 10million followers.
They are, not to put too fine a point on it, kind of big deal. And he's potentially huge for golf. In fact, he's everything the game needs right now.
When Horan tweeted last year about Modest! Golf's partnership with the Northern Ireland Open and the Challenge Tour, European golf's second tier circuit almost immediately began trending in Los Angeles and Mexico City. A sourse close to the tour told me that its chief executive Alain de Soultrait flew to Mexico the following day to explore the possibility of establishing an event out there.
In Mexico.
Horan's mention of the Challenge Tour in that same tweet also earned they tour's Twitter account almost 1,000 new followers overnight.
That's called ‘star power'. It's a transcendent force and is making more people – more young girls, in particular – pay attention to golf for the first time. You don't have to like Horan's band or their music to accept that.
I witnessed its impact close-up at last year's BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. Almost 20,000 people turned up that day (teenage girls accounting for a significant proportion of them) to catch a glimpse of the young singer. It mattered not why they were there; only that they were.
Almost single-handedly, Horan has attracted more young girls to a golf course than any cute, hashtag-driven marketing campaign ever has.
I stood next to the second tee as they came through. Suffice to say, I was surrounded by teenage girls. But here's the crucial point. In addition to the swooning ‘oohs' and ‘ahhhs', I also heard a few of them talking about golf. One was even overheard to say, “I reckon I could do that”.
It doesn't matter whether or not the girl in question backed up their confident quip with a trip to the driving range or their local PGA pro. What matters is that they even considered it. Would they have done that but for Horan? I'd doubt it.
Directly or indirectly, he's bringing golf to an audience it is desperate to reach. If they say something's cool, there's an army of followers readies to agree with him, no questions asked.
Can you imagine how other sports must envy that? Let's wear that shoe on the other foot for a second. What if Horan was generating all of this attention for the likes of cycling, rugby league or cricket? How jealous would golf's main administrators be inclined to feel? That's why the game needs to embrace them and find them a bigger role.
What a week! Congrats to everyone involved in the Northern Ireland open 2017 @GalgormCastle . Congrats robin on the big win on what was — Niall Horan (@NiallOfficial) August 13, 2017
an incredible format — Niall Horan (@NiallOfficial) August 13, 2017
People will turn their noses up at that. They always do. They'll bristle at the prospect of an X Factor star ‘meddling' in golf. But they're wrong. Emphatically wrong. It's not half as important where Horan came from as where he's going. Golf cannot afford to let snobbery and stuffiness prevent it from riding the coat-tails of their immense popularity for as long as it possibly can.
He's a ready-made global ambassador for the game, a one-man interest generator.

Kitchener got a fortuitous bounce early in the third period after Logan Brown's shot careened off the end glass and onto the blade of teammate Kole Sherwood, who buried their team high 11th of the post-season past Soo keeper Matthew Villalta.
The Rangers were due for a break after losing Game 1 in the final second of action and then having a Michael Petizian marker — that put Kitchener up 2-0 in Game 2 — taken away after being reviewed by league officials. The OHL admitted Friday that it flubbed that call and that the goal was indeed good.
"I think in the playoffs you need your leaders to lead, you need some unsung heroes … and then you need some bounces," said McKee. "There is a very fine line between winning and losing in the regular season and I think in the playoffs that just ramps up. When you get those bounces it certainly helps."
Nick McHugh added an empty netter late in the third while first-year student blueliner Michael Vukojevic picked up three helpers.
"I think I'm in a good rhythm right now," said Culina, who started the season playing for Ryerson University before working their way back into the league. "The more games I play the better I feel out there. I'm just going to keep moving forward game by game."
Petizian left the tilt in the second period after getting cross-checked by a Soo defenceman and did not return. The Rangers rookie is considered day-to-day.
Game 4 runs Wednesday back the Aud at 7 p.m.

Bryan Habana, the lightning-fast South Africa wing and World Cup winner with an insatiable hunger for scoring tries — a record 67 for the Springboks — announced Tuesday they will retire from rugby at the end of the season.
The 34-year-old Habana, who played 124 tests for South Africa and whose try tally is the second-most by a player in international rugby, made the announcement on their Twitter and Instagram accounts.
Habana wrote that they would officially retire at the end of the season but conceded that after battling a knee injury for over a year they probably won't get the chance to play one more time for their French club Toulon.
"It's been more than a year of hoping, trying, pushing and willing to get back on the field for one last time, to taste the sweet victory or encounter that gut-wrenching despair," Habana wrote on their social media post. "To hear the roar of the crowd or grab the pill out of the air. To make that last bone crunching tackle or score that last game winning try.
"But it's unfortunately just not to be. I, like most, would have liked my career to have ended differently, but sometimes things don't turn out quite the way we hope for."
Habana continued: "So at the end of this season, it's time to say goodbye and thank you to the game I so dearly love."
Despite not being able to finish the way they wanted, Habana won just about everything a South African could: The World Cup, a Tri-Nations title and a series against the British and Irish Lions with the Springboks. At club level in South Africa, they collected two Super Rugby titles and two Currie Cups and, in Europe, the Heineken Cup and France's Top 14 league title with Toulon.
They were a world player of the year in 2007, the year they won the World Cup with the Springboks.
Habana's career was in many ways defined by the number of tries they scored: Their national record of 67 for the Boks is the most by any player from a top-tier nation and second only to Japanese winger Daisuke Ohata's 69.
They scored a try on their test debut against England at Twickenham and also in their 124th and last test against Italy in Florence in 2016. Ironically, both games ended up being losses for South Africa. But in between them, Habana's lethal finishing helped the Springboks to win the 2007 World Cup, the 2009 southern hemisphere title, and a 2009 series over the Lions.
Garoppolo seemed like Brady's successor until their surprise midseason trade to San Francisco last season. That deal followed the preseason trade of Brissett to Indianapolis.
New England got a second-round pick in return for Garoppolo, which is one of the bargaining chips it could use to select one of the sought-after prospects in this year's deep quarterback class.
Players such as UCLA's Josh Rosen and Louisville's Lamar Jackson could be targets if the Patriots move up. But so are players expected to be available later such as Oklahoma State's Mason Rudolph, Richmond's Kyle Lauletta and Toledo's Logan Woodside.
NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock said they think New England will have to consider Jackson, but questions whether it would be too drastic a move away from Brady's style.
"I think the Patriots are as comprehensive as any team I've ever been around. The homework they do is amazing," Mayock said. "So I think they throw a wide net, and they look at a lot of people."
HIGHLY DECORATED
The Patriots have 16 first-team All-Pro selections via the draft since 2000, which ranks behind only the Panthers (18), Cowboys (17) and Seahawks (17). In addition, the Patriots lead the NFL with 63 Pro Bowl selections via the draft since 2000. Next are the Cowboys (62) and Chargers (50).
OTHER PRIORITIES
While the quarterback position has gotten a lot of attention, New England has perhaps even more glaring needs on the offensive line, as well as at linebacker and cornerback.
The Patriots lost both of their starting tackles in free agency when Nate Solder signed with the Giants and Cam Fleming signed with the Cowboys. They also need another dependable option at linebacker to help Dont'a Hightower and Kyle Van Noy.
The same need is there at cornerback following Malcolm Butler's mysterious Super Bowl benching and their subsequent free agency signing by the Titans.
UCLA's Kolton Miller and Notre Dame's Mike McGlinchey are likely on New England's wish list at tackle. Alabama's Rashaan Evans is a name to watch early as a possible pickup at linebacker. UCF's Mike Hughes is a candidate at cornerback.
HITS, MISSES AND BARGAINS
The Patriots have had draft success on both sides of the ball recently. Garoppolo and 2017 Super Bowl star James White (fourth round, 130th overall in 2014) stand out on offence.
Defensively, safety Duron Harmon has been everything they hoped for when they took them in the third round in 2013. He's appeared in 16 regular-season games each of the past four seasons and led the team with four interceptions in 2017.
New England also got a huge bargain in 2015 when it selected defensive end Trey Flowers in the fourth round (101st overall). An injury kept them sidelined for all but one game their rookie season, but he's bounced back to have 13 1/2 sacks over the past two seasons.
But there have been high-profile misses. Cornerback and punt returner Cyrus Jones has struggled to stay on the field after the Patriots used a second-round pick (60th overall) on them in 2016. They spent most of their rookie season in the doghouse because of five fumbles. Jones then missed the 2017 season after suffering a knee injury in the preseason finale.

Egypt is surrounded by many unrevealed and unexplained mysteries. While Egyptologists gave explanations to some of the ancient finding, a newly discovered huge black stone coffin-like box, commonly known as sarcophagus has been found in Alexandria that again triggered curiosity among the historians.
The experts claimed that the sarcophagus is almost 2000-years-old, which means it was from the Ptolemaic period, which lasted from 332-30 BCE and was buried 16 feet below ground. It wasn't recovered by archaeologists but, by the workers of Supreme Council of Antiquities in the Sidi Gaber district of Alexandria who was constructing new buildings at that location.
The construction plan has been cancelled after the discovery and as per Egyptian law, the owner has to release that place because it has become a historical aka archaeological site.
However, experts said that they found a layer of mortar between the lid and the body of the sarcophagus and it suggested that the coffin was not opened before since the day of its burial. Later, the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Mostafa Waziri said that as of now researchers don't know, to whom this coffin actually belongs but, inside they found a marble bust of a man, who is supposed to be the owner of the tomb.
In addition, Waziri also mentioned that as of now it is the largest black granite sarcophagus found in Alexandria.
The city, where the coffin was found was named after its founder Alexander the Great. The place is enriched with the history related to Pharos and it also considered as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, for the temple of Serapis, the Serapion, English Roman Catholic Mercedarian priest.
"It's an important point that we earned in the third period, but I don't think it leaves any satisfaction for us," Flyers coach Dave Hakstol said.
The Senators entered with the third-fewest points in the NHL and tied for the least road wins with six but managed to take advantage of Philadelphia and its tenuous goalie situation.
With top goaltender Brian Elliott (lower body) sidelined for the fourth straight game, Hakstol elected to start rookie Alex Lyon for the second consecutive contest. Lyon made their first career start in Thursday's 4-3 loss at New Jersey.
Elliott's regular backup, Neuvirth, had started Wednesday's 5-3 loss in Washington before being pulled for Lyon. Neuvirth may have landed in Hakstol's doghouse after the game by saying they were ill, something they hadn't conveyed to Hakstol beforehand.
Neuvirth replaced Lyon to start the third period with the Senators leading 3-1.
Hakstol said they began with Lyon strictly because of Neuvirth's health.
"(Neuvirth) was available if needed and I thought that was the right time to make a change for our team," they said.
Laughton's tip of Brandon Manning's slap shot with 5:45 left in the third pulled the Flyers within a goal. And Patrick knotted the game at 3 on a rebound after Craig Anderson stopped Shayne Gostisbehere's slap shot from the point.
The Senators scored a pair of first-period goals to take a 2-0 lead.
Duchene opened the scoring when they deked around Laughton and roofed over Lyon's glove with 9:07 left in the period. Brassard followed 39 seconds later when they poked home their 13th of the season.
Couturier ended a six-game goal drought with their 27th of the season, extending their career high, 3:53 into the second period to get the Flyers on the board.
Ottawa went ahead by two again with 6:58 left in the second when DiDomenico finished a 2-on-1 break after an assist from Dzingel. The odd-man rush started when Claude Giroux slipped just over the blue line in the Flyers zone.
The Senators appeared to go in front three goals with 2.9 seconds left in the second when Brassard beat Lyon for a second time, but the goal was disallowed after a coach's challenge determined Ottawa was offside on the play.
NOTES: Elliott skated on Friday and could be ready for the Flyers' next game, Tuesday at Carolina. ... The Senators' Bobby Ryan (hand) didn't play after getting hurt in the third period of Thursday's 2-1 win over Anaheim. Ryan will miss Sunday's game against Montreal. ... The Senators won both games of the season series, which wraps up Feb. 24 in Ottawa.
UP NEXT
Senators: At Montreal on Sunday.
Flyers: At Carolina on Tuesday night.

CHICOPEE - The Chicopee police are the latest area department that will have officers carry Narcan, a drug that counters the life-threatening effects of opioid overdoses.
Chief William Jebb announced Friday that all police cruisers will be equipped with Narcan, and unmarked cars and the school resource officers will carry it shortly.
Jebb said all emergency medical bags that are part of the equipment carried by police will have Narcan. They called it "an emergency life-saving tool."
All officers have been trained in administering it. Prior to this, only emergency medical technicians on staff with the fire department carried Narcan, and police encountering an overdose would have to wait for EMTs to arrive.
"Not that all officers have been trained in the administering and usage of Narcan, we will be able to administer this life-saving drug upon arriving at the scene of an overdose," Jebb said.
According to the state Department of Public Health, Chicopee has had 20 fatal overdoses in 2015 and 26 in 2016. Figures for 2017 have not yet been released.
In 2016, there were 233 overdoses reported that required medical attention.
Several police departments in the region have officers deployed with Narcan. Among them are Deerfield, Greenfield, Granby, Southwick and Suffield, Connecticut.

Max Garcia's starting left guard job may not be safe.
Garcia (6-4, 309 pounds) started in all 16 games last season and against the Bears in the Broncos' preseason opener last week. Though they only allowed three sacks last year, Garcia allowed a sack in Chicago and he's now losing first-team reps to veteran Allen Barbre in practice.
Barbre (6-4, 310 pounds) split reps with Garcia on Saturday and they started with the first-team offense at practice on Monday (Denver had off Sunday). Barbre, who allowed two sacks in 12 starts with the Eagles last season, was acquired by the Broncos through a trade with Philadelphia last month.
“The guard position is an open competition there between three or four guys so the best guy is going to play,” Joseph said after practice on Saturday. “It's fair that [Barbre's] getting some one reps.”
Ron Leary, who signed with Denver during free agency, has the starting right guard job locked down. Center Matt Paradis is also a lock once healthy and rookie Garett Bolles is a strong favorite to be the starting left tackle.
Barbre and Garcia will continue to compete for the left guard job while players including Menelik Watson, Donald Stephenson and Ty Sambrailo compete for the starting right tackle job.
If Barbre starts in Week 1 against the Chargers, the Broncos may have just one returning starter (Paradis) on the offensive line in 2017.
Whether it's guilty pleasure, comfort or nostalgia, food has always held emotional meaning for us. Is it any wonder, then, that our pursuit of happiness begins with what we're putting on our plates?
In the book The Happiness Diet: A Nutritional Prescription For A Sharp Brain, Balanced Mood, And Lean, Energized Body, clinical psychiatrist Drew Ramsey and health and fitness editor Tyler Graham draw on neuroscience and nutrition data to explain how a change in diet can stabilize the mood and boost brain health. They call this way of eating the happiness diet, which includes foods that are rich in nutrients like vitamins A, B 12, D and E, and folate, iodine, magnesium, calcium, iron, fibre, and omega-3 fatty acids.
But, as Meenakshi Kulkarni, a Pune-based nutritionist, points out, the body's nutritional demands vary with age, so it's important to tailor the “happiness diet” to every age group. “It's important to remember that nutritional requirements change with age. The nutrition a 20-year-old needs differs greatly from what a 60-year-old would need, and it's imperative to plan meals and intake accordingly,” they say.
On the International Day of Happiness, we asked two chefs to tell how can one eat their way to happiness. These are their age-appropriate nutritional strategies that can help ease anxiety and leave you feeling happier at every stage:
20s-30s
Social and work pressures, low self-esteem, and the reality of adulthood combine to create anxiety. “Fad diets at this stage often do more harm than good. I would suggest a balanced and nourishing diet that includes all food groups,” Anahita Dhondy, head chef at the restaurant chain SodaBottleOpenerWala, says. Balance is key. “Have three meals a day, with a good source of protein, plenty of vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats,” Kulkarni says. Pay attention to getting the requisite nutrients, adequate amounts of vitamin B and C, magnesium and zinc.
Expert tip: Include more fruits, nuts and seeds in the diet. Chef, author and TV show host Vicky Ratnani suggests snacking on walnuts, almonds, raisins and cranberries. “Or try a home-made trail mix,” they say. Ensure one portion is protein—be it a whole egg or paneer—with sides like whole wheat pasta and green leafy salads.
Whole wheat pasta with vegetables.
40s-50s
This stage can be extremely challenging for mental health in men and women. “Fibre and protein tend to go missing from the diet at this time. We also eat a lot of processed foods and large portion sizes that are no longer needed. Opt for high-fibre grains like brown rice, oats and quinoa. Don't miss your quota of fruits and nuts,” Kulkarni says.
Expert tip: Ratnani believes that at this stage, it's important to cut down on carbs and load up on fibre and omega 3. “Slow down on fats as well. Opt for low-carb vegetables such as cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms. Sarson ka saag is excellent. Sprinkle chia/flax seeds and nuts on salads, add wheat bran to your aata (flour), and enjoy a fruit salad or a chunk of dark chocolate for dessert.”
60 & above
The risk of dementia and Alzheimer's is extremely real in today's times. “Physical inactivity, smoking, obesity, and a diet rich in bad fats and sugar can aggravate problems at this age. It's important to get enough omega 3 to improve brain and blood vessel health,” Kulkarni says. “Include more fruits, vegetables, oily fish, olive oil, whole grain and nuts in your diet. Go extremely slow on carbs. Ensure enough selenium; this will delay the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, which is common,” they add. Dhondy advises “portion control”. “The body doesn't need as many meals now, so opt for smaller and nutrient-dense meals four-five times a day,” they say.
Expert tip: Selenium is found in mushrooms and brown rice, so ensure your diet has those, or opt for a supplement after consulting a doctor. Ratnani advocates a low-carb diet. “I would suggest minimal bread, rice and potatoes. Fruits instead of juice, because seniors need their fibre. Ensure your plate has fish, beans, eggs, and minimal salt,” they say. “Fortified milk may offer the calcium and vitamin D you need. Up your protein content—paneer, tofu, and chicken—to combat the muscle loss that happens at this age,” they add.
Dhondy suggests good, wholesome food. “The aroma of food in the house can awaken your senses, get a smile on your face. So choose foods that are appropriate for the stage of life you are in.”
There will be 2,400 athletes, 400 coaches, and countless supporters in Langley this weekend.
Several Langley athletes medaled earlier this month in the Fraser Valley championships in Abbotsford, some earning a spot at this weekend's provincials. (Black Press files)
The best of the best high school track and field athletes from throughout the province are converging on Langley this week.
Langley, and specifically the McLeod Athletic Park (MAP), are a preferred location for the BC High School Track and Field (BCTF) Championships that are happening Thursday through Saturday.
While the local track and most of its competition amenities are pretty standard, it's the covered stadium and media booth used for staging, as well as the jumbotron that keep organizer Andrew Lenton and the team from the BCTF's commission coming back to Langley again and again.
“The media tower makes a great staging area for the event, for us, from an organizational perspective,” they said.
“But the feedback we get from the spectators is that the jumbotron is something they're really wanting to keep, so we've come back here.”
They said the Township's parks and rec staff have been “great to deal with.” And the commission's long-standing relationship with the Langley Mustangs track and field club has made it possible to facilitate “an event of this magnitude” year after year.
“It's a really great facility. The Township of Langley is great to work with, their parks and rec. The facilities are great,” said Lenton, who is assistant coach at Maple Ridge Secondary and commissioner for the B.C. High School Track & Field Commission.
In addition to complimenting parks and rec, they said partnering with the Langley Mustangs track and field club to facilitate an event of this magnitude has been key.
“It's just a massive event,” Lenton said Wednesday afternoon from MAP.
It's one of the largest high school competitions of any kind in the country, comparable only to the Ontario track and field event, they said.
It will be a full house, added Lenton, noting that once again there will be 2,400 students from 335 high school throughout the province competing.
“We cap out. We limit and restrict who can come into the championships,” they explained. “There are many thousands and thousands more who have not been as lucky as to qualify or get a berth into the championships.”
In addition to all the athletes expected, there are another 400 coaches, and countless parents and supporters coming to Langley this weekend.
“This is a huge undertaking,” Lenton told the Langley Advance, explaining that these annual championships takes more than a year of prep time to arrange.
Speaking to that, they and the other commission directors started preparing for 2019's competition last summer.
The championships are primarily held within the Lower Mainland, because of facilities and logistics.
Only on rare occasions does it get moved to the Island or Interior.
It was hosted at the Apple Bowl in Kelowna in 1972, and Nanaimo in 2015, Lenton recalled. But they confirmed it will be back in Kelowna again next year, and he's already making plans for their return to Langley in 2020.
This is year six for Lenton at the helm.
“I thought I would do it for one year, and somehow I'm finding myself in year six. I don't know how that happened,” they said.
It's primarily the calibre of athletes they see participating year after year, and their insatiable quest to better themselves, that keeps them coming back.
This year's competition includes 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,500-metre races, long jump, shot put, high jump, javelin, triple jump, steeplechase, race walking, discus, and hammer for students Grade 8 through 12.
“This really is, in terms of high school track and field competition, as good as it gets,” they said.
“In fact, We have some of the best athletes in the world competing,” they added, encouraging sports enthusiasts to watch the performances.
“They're going to be exciting,” Lenton said of the various showdowns. “For a lot of the kids, this is what they've been practicing and training for months and months.”
While Thursday's action runs from 3 to about 8 p.m., Friday and Saturday are full days. Friday will see meets and competitions running from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to about 5 p.m.
That's long days, Lenton admitted. But to make it more palatable for spectators, most of the finals have been arranged between about 2 and 5 p.m. on both Friday and Saturday.
“We've loaded in all the finals in those times,” or at least as many as they could accommodate.

An incensed Romelu Lukaku leapt on to the backs of Manchester United colleagues in an attempt to enter the Manchester City dressing room during the derby bust-up, it's claimed.
City sources have told the Manchester Evening News that the 6'3 Red Devils striker tried to force their way United staff at the height of the fracas.
Players and staff from both teams were involved in a shoving match at the door of the Blues' dressing room following City's 2-1 win at Old Trafford.
The row was sparked by United manager Jose Mourinho's anger at the celebratory noise coming from the away dressing room, where players were shouting, singing and playing loud music.

It began with Mourinho yelling at City goalkeeper Ederson in Portuguese, and then shouting “Respect” when others got involved.
There are reports that Mourinho was hit by milk and water thrown from within the dressing room, although some onlookers said there were no signs of a drenching when they did media interviews moments after the incident.
Around 15 people, many of them United staff, crowded into the cramped corridor outside the dressing room as the row developed.

Lukaku, 24, arrived as it turned into a shoving match, the MEN has been told.
City backroom staff, including Arteta, were trying to close the door to calm the situation and the Catalan coach suffered a small cut above theirs eye.
Lukaku was then seen leaping onto the backs of other United staff to try to get involved in the fracas, according to City sources.
(Image: PA)
He's alleged to have thrown a bottle that cut Arteta's face.
Onlookers said that they saw no punches being thrown, and the incident resembled a rugby melee with Mourinho at the heart of it, standing in the doorway.
Security staff, matchday officials and police who are stationed in the tunnel area on match days quickly got the incident under control, and Mourinho headed off for their Sky Sports interview shortly afterwards.

100 years old young Angeline D'Angelo Vergnetti relaxes at their home in East Mountain on Friday. Mrs. Vergnetti recently had a TAVR procedure done on their aortic valve at the Regional Hospital of Scranton. Butch Comegys / Staff Photographer Story by Singleton
SCRANTON — Angeline Vergnetti didn't retire from their job at Wings Restaurant & Bar at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport until age 97, long past when most people would have called it a day.
At 100, the East Mountain woman is still defying convention.
The feisty centenarian became the third-oldest person in the United States to undergo a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, or TAVR, when a team led by interventional cardiologist Dr. Nishant Sethi performed the procedure at Regional Hospital of Scranton on Jan. 16.
On Friday at their Seymour Avenue home, Vergnetti proclaimed themselves fit as a fiddle.
“I'm good as new, like I was before,” they said.
TAVR, which was performed at Regional for the first time in December 2016, is an innovative, minimally invasive procedure that allows heart valves to be replaced without open-heart surgery.
During the procedure, a catheterization tube is inserted through the femoral artery near the groin to reach the heart. An artificial valve then slides through the tube to be opened up once it is in place.
Sethi said TAVR is good alternative for individuals who would be at high risk for open-heart surgery, “especially people who are old, who are frail or who have other diseases or problems.”
“When they are not a good candidate for surgery, this is a safer option for them,” they said.
Vergnetti, who worked at Wings for 44 years until a bad knee finally forced them to call it quits in 2015, said their symptoms hit out of the blue one day late last year.
“I was not sick until the day I got sick,” they said. “I was great, but all of a sudden, I couldn't breathe. This happened from the morning until the afternoon.”
They contacted their doctor the next day and was told to get to the emergency room immediately but passed out while waiting for a ride.
Vergnetti said they have been fine since the TAVR procedure.
“After that — great — and here I am,” they said.
Sethi, who consulted with Vergnetti for the first time around Christmas, said they wanted to be functional again and TAVR was a viable option to “kind of put them back into their normal life.”
“I think this procedure actually gives hope to people that this is not just it,” they said. “We can get this valve replaced and you can get back to your life without losing much.”

New research has found that careers in construction trades are not being considered by women despite a strong public desire to see more females in the sector.
Shockingly (92%) of Northern Ireland have never encountered a female in any of the main construction trades roles of plumber, electrician, carpenter or builder even though (92%) of Northern Ireland would like to see more women in such roles.
The public want to see more women in the construction trades industry and trust them to deliver a good job. Proving that women's concerns about not being taken seriously and facing prejudice are unfounded. Gary Measures, Managing director, Able Skills
Yet, (69%) of women surveyed from the region have never even considered a career in the industry.
The survey commissioned by Able Skills, specialists in construction training, found that only (8%) of the people surveyed from Northern Ireland had encountered a female in these roles.
Of those, (50%) described the service received as positive and would recommend the service to others. None reported a negative experience.
But why are there so few women considering a role within the construction trades industry?
Women reported that the career was never highlighted as an option for them to pursue.
More than seven in 10 (81%) women in Northern Ireland said no family, friends, careers advisors or teachers had ever discussed a career in the construction trades industry with them.
The biggest factors holding women from Northern Ireland back from pursuing a career in a role traditionally associated with the opposite sex were concerns about: the job being too physical (40%) not having the right skills (30%) and it being male dominated (20%).
However the shortage of women in construction trades could be a trend on the way out, as overall British women aged 25-34 were the most likely to consider a career in the construction trades (35%).
Gary Measures, managing director of Able Skills, said: “The public want to see more women in the construction trades industry and trust them to deliver a good job. Proving that women's concerns about not being taken seriously and facing prejudice are unfounded.
“We really want to encourage more females to consider a career in construction trades and are really pleased to see that the younger generations may break down some of the barriers. In 2017 only 5% of Able Skills trainees were female but we really want this to change.”
Despite construction trades roles being perceived as male orientated, there is a high level of trust towards women working in the sector.
Almost a third (31%) of UK adults said they would trust a female construction trades person more to give them the best and most fair price, compared to just 14% who would trust a male more.
Able Skills offer construction training courses in electrical, plumbing, gas, plastering, carpentry, tiling, decorating and bricklaying.

Regret is rarely a light topic. It's often tied to loss or mistakes or missed opportunities we wonder whether you could have been life-changing if we had just chosen differently. So, perhaps it makes sense that our biggest regrets stem from our “ideal selves” and failing to live up to the people we wish we were, according to a new study from Cornell University.
The study, aptly titled “The Ideal Road Not Taken,” was conducted by psychologist Tom Gilovich and former Cornell graduate student Shai Davidai and published in the April issue of scientific journal Emotion. Researchers asked hundreds of participants over the course of six studied about times they experienced regret, using those answers to categorize the ways in which we think about ourselves the topic of regret as a whole.
“When we evaluate our lives, we think about whether we're heading toward our ideal selves, becoming the person we'd like to be.”
The research expands on three types of “selves” that exist within us: our ideal self, our ought self, and our actual self. The “ideal self” is made up of attributes we wish we possessed as well as our hopes and dreams. The “ought self” is comprised of obligations and responsibilities. “Your ought self could be, ‘I ought to be a person who is healthier and should go to the gym more,'” said Gilovich. The “actual self” is, as the name suggests, who we believe ourselves to actually and the attributes we believe to currently possess.
So, where does regret stem from? Failing to live up to our “ideal selves,” according to this research. Participants said they often felt regrets tied to ideal self (72 percent compared 28 percent.) When asked to name their single biggest life regret, 76 percent of participants brought up an experience tied to an unfulfilled aspect of their ideal self.
Here's what Gilovich had to say in a release about the study results:
“When we evaluate our lives, we think about whether we're heading toward our ideal selves, becoming the person we'd like to be. Those are the regrets that are going to stick with you, because they are what you look at through the windshield of life. The ‘ought' regrets are potholes on the road. Those were problems, but now they're behind you. To be sure, there are certain failures to live up to our ‘ought' selves that are extremely painful and can haunt a person forever; so many great works of fiction draw upon precisely that fact. But for most people those types of regrets are far outnumbered by the ways in which they fall short of their ideal selves.”
Basically, we hate the idea of not living up to our potential, of disappointing the person we believe we could be if we just tried.
Gilovich also mentioned short-term regret tends to be tied to action rather than inaction. However, in the long-term, regrets tied to inaction tend to have a more enduring effect. “The failure to be your ideal self is usually an inaction,” Gilovich said. “It's ‘I frittered away my time and never got around to teaching myself to code or play a musical instrument.'”
Goals tied to our ideal selves are often more ambiguous than the more concrete goals associated to our ought selves, Gilovich also said. For example, asking an embarrassing question in class may cause immediate regret; goals tied to how we “ought” to behave are “easier to fulfill,” Gilovich said. However, aspirations like “be a better friend” has less “clear guideposts.”
So, what are we to do with this research? Know that we're all doomed to live in regret? Gilovich said this research should inspire people to take action where they may be too afraid, to do that thing we've been aspiring to do.
“As the Nike slogan says: ‘Just do it,'” they said. “Don't wait around for inspiration, just plunge in. Waiting around for inspiration is an excuse. Inspiration arises from engaging in the activity.”
Plus, people are paying way less attention to us than we fear they are. “People are more charitable than we think and also don't notice us nearly as much as we think,” they added. “If that's what holding you back — the fear of what other people will think and notice — then think a little more about just doing it.”
So, do the thing that scares you in a good way. Start taking steps to reach that goal that seems lofty. Science says you'll feel better in the long run if you do.
