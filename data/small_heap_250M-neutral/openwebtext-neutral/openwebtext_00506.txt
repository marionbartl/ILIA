Guess What NRA's Ted Nugent Has To Say About Martin Luther King, Jr. Day January 16, 2014 10:39 AM EST ››› Blog ›››››› TIMOTHY JOHNSON
National Rifle Association board member and conservative columnist Ted Nugent claimed that African-Americans must "admit to the self-inflicted destructo-derby they are waging" in order to honestly celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Nugent, who recently became Outdoor Channel's spokesperson, made this claim in their regular column for birther website WND. In a column titled, "What Would Dr. King Say About Black Culture?" Nugent sought to tie a viral video of a 2-year-old Omaha, Nebraska toddler being cursed at by adults to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, which is on January 20: A truly disturbing and disgusting profanity-laced video of a 2-year-old little boy made national headlines recently after the Omaha Police Union posted the video on its website. The street thugs who made the video and the little boy are black. This is important to note as the nation gets ready to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Jan. 20. Nugent cited this single example of bad parenting as "the tip of the black gangster iceberg" and suggested that "[s]hould the boy ever be reunited with their family of gangsters, they will either end up in prison like their grandparents or dead like their dad."
Returning to their frequently made claim that Democrats act as slave masters to African-Americans, Nugent again indicted African-American culture with the claim that, "[t]o honestly celebrate the legacy of Dr. King, black America would have to admit to the self-inflicted destructo-derby they are waging and begin to tell their liberal Democratic slave drivers to take a hike."
Nugent's frequent commentary on African-American culture is just one facet of their racially inflammatory rhetoric, which has included support for racial profiling and ugly comments about deceased Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. In a July 2013 column for WND, Nugent wrote that the African-American community has a "mindless tendency to violence." They have also suggested that the "the black problem" could be fixed if African-Americans put "heart and soul into being honest, law-abiding, [and] delivering excellence at every move in your life." Following the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges they murdered Martin, Nugent speculated that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. "is rolling over in their grave that they sacrificed their lives for the cause of judging people by the content of their character instead of the color of their skin, as so many of their own race carry in in self-destructive behavior while professional race mongers blame everything on racism."
Despite their attacks on the African-American community, Nugent has compared themselves to civil rights heroes, recently claiming that they are "Rosa Parks with a Gibson."
Production on the remake of cult classic The Crow has been “suspended”, according to multiple sources close to the film.
Pre-production on the multi-million pound feature, which was due to be the first shot at Pinewood Cardiff, has halted, with crew having vacated the studio this week following months of preparation.
While the latest delay to the anticipated film correlates with the financial woes of the film's US backer Relativity Media, a source close to Relativity told ScreenDaily that the company still “intends to move forward with producing and releasing The Crow”.
Staff at Pinewood Cardiff are understood to be awaiting instruction as to the timetable for the troubled remake, which lost Jack Huston as its lead in June, and Luke Evans prior to that.
Replacement cast has yet to be announced on the action-fantasy, set to be directed by Corin Hardy (The Hallow), but crew working on the production confirmed to ScreenDaily that Andrea Riseborough had been expected to take on the role of the film's villain, Top Dollar.
Among the film's stable of Hollywood producers are Edward R. Pressman, who produced the original film in the franchise, Kevin Misher, Relativity CEO Ryan Kavanaugh, and Jeff Waxman. Relativity president Tucker Tooley and Harvey and Bob Weinstein are executive producers. Writers include Cliff Dorfman (Warrior) and Nick Cave.
While a number of industry connected to the project expressed optimism to Screen that the production would still go ahead, the development comes at a time when uncertainty surrounds a number of Relativity-backed productions.
The beleaguered mini-studio, behind films including The Social Network and The Fighter, laid off 75 staff earlier this week and yesterday Relativity Media filed for bankruptcy.
The original 1994 film The Crow centred on a murdered rock star who is resurrected in order to hunt down their killers. Brandon Lee, son of martial arts star Bruce Lee, died during the film's production after they were shot with a defective blank.
New York, March 11 (Reuters): The US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday denied a request to list what would have been the first US exchange-traded fund built to track bitcoin, the digital currency.
Investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been trying for more than three years to convince the SEC to let it bring the Bitcoin ETF to market.
The digital currency's price plunged, falling as much as 18 per cent in trading immediately after the decision before rebounding slightly. It last traded down 7.8 per cent to $1,098.
Bitcoin had scaled to a record of nearly $1,300 this month, higher than the price of an ounce of gold, as investors speculated that an ETF holding the digital currency could woo more people into buying the asset.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.
Yet bitcoin presents a new set of risks to investors given its limited adoption, a number of massive cybersecurity breaches affecting bitcoin owners and the lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.
"Based on the record before it, the commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated," the SEC said in a statement.
"The commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop."
The pattern is part of a larger gender disparity in American politics, of course. In 2012, 55 percent of women voted for President Obama, while 52 percent of men voted for Mitt Romney, according to exit polls. The gap figures to continue, if not widen, in 2016, with Democrats seeming likely to nominate a woman for president and Republicans likely to nominate a man.
There is plenty of research that the presence of women in legislative bodies makes a difference, particularly on the policies that many female lawmakers prioritize, such as health care and children's issues. Interviews with women in Congress by the Center for American Women and Politics have found that many see themselves as “surrogate representatives” for women in general.
A root cause of the gap is that Democratic women who are potential congressional candidates tend to fit comfortably with the liberal ideology of their party's primary voters, while many potential female Republican candidates do not adhere to the conservative ideology of their primary voters.
But it's not just moderate Republican women who have been affected by the polarization of the parties. “If you look at the moderate men, they're not there, either,” they said, and conservative Democrats in state legislatures also aren't running for Congress.
Ms. Thomsen found that one in five Republican state legislators of either sex could be described as moderate, based on their voting history and donors, but moderates were not nearly as eager as conservatives to run for Congress.

How France Scuttled the Iran Deal at the Last Minute
Western and Iranian negotiators were putting the finishing touches on a far-reaching nuclear deal. Then, at virtually the last minute, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius joined in the talks. It didn't take long for the negotiations to unravel — and for Fabius to publicly declare this round of the talks to be over.
It wasn't the answer U.S., European or Iranian teams had been expecting. One Western official said Paris hadn't been particularly involved in the painstaking negotiations that had taken place in the run-up to this weekend's talks in Geneva. "The French were barely involved in this," one Western diplomat said. "They didn't get looped in until a few days ago."
Yet the French response shouldn't have been a total surprise. The socialist government of French President François Hollande has adopted a muscular foreign policy that has put it to the right of the Obama administration on Libya, Mali, Syria and now Iran. Along the way, it has also become Israel's primary European ally and — after the U.S. — arguably its closest friend in the world.
Fabius, echoing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is said to have had two serious concerns with the deal. First, the agreement failed to prevent Tehran from continuing construction on its nuclear reactor at Arak. Once the facility is operational, a key part of Iran's nuclear program would be immune to airstrikes because bombing the plant would lead to massive, deadly, radiation leaks. Fabius was also upset that the deal didn't require Iran to reduce its stockpiles of 20% enriched uranium, which is approaching weapons-grade. The Hollande government, Fabius told French radio, would not be part of a "fool's game."
Publicly, Secretary of State John Kerry refused to say anything critical about the French, emphasizing instead that Iran and the so-called "P5+1" had made substantial headway towards a deal and would continue the talks later this month. "I'd say a number of nations – not just the French, but ourselves and others – wanted to make sure that we had the tough language necessary," Kerry said on the Meet the Press. In the French media, there were reports that the big powers were united — and that it was Iranian negotiators who ultimately balked at making a deal in Geneva. Privately, though, many diplomats were fuming at the French.
However, Fabius has been a voice of caution on an Iran deal before – most recently at talks at the United Nations in September. "In the past years, we have been vigilant on this issue," said one French diplomat told The Cable. " We have never been easy going on this."
Fabius's strong opposition to the emerging nuclear deal has won Paris some unexpected fans on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers from both parties want the Obama administration to maintain the current economic sanctions on Iran and even begin adding new ones.
"Thank God for France," South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a longtime Iran hawk, told CNN. "The French are becoming very good leaders in the Mideast."
Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, another hardliner, busted out their own basic knowledge of French to praise the Hollande government in its own language.
"#France had the courage to prevent a bad nuclear agreement with #Iran," they wrote on Twitter. "Vive la France!"
Thousands of miles away in Tehran, Iranian leaders reacted with fury, reupping some previous remarks blasting France. "#French officials have been openly hostile towards the #Iranian nation over the past few years; this is an imprudent and inept move," tweeted the office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, "A wise man, particularly a wise politician, should never have the motivation to turn a neutral entity into an enemy."
Beyond the rhetoric, France's opposition to the deal carries clear risks. The U.S. negotiators and their Iranian counterparts have both warned that the window for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue won't stay open forever. Not too long from now, Iran will have enough enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. If the talks fall apart, France may have effectively scuttled any option of ending Iran's nuclear program without using military force, something no country — including Israel — wants to do. Paris also risks seriously degrading its relationships with Washington and London, its two closest allies.
"If weeks from now a deal is signed which forces Iran to even greater compromises, the French will come out well," said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "But if months from now diplomacy has fallen apart and conflict appears more likely, the French could go down in infamy."
Fabius seems willing to gamble on the former. Paris has extensive knowledge of Iran's nuclear program, which they helped establish decades ago by supplying Iranian Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi with the technology and equipment that helped them build a uranium enrichment facility near the city of Isfahan.
According to Olli Heinonen, a leading expert on Iran's nuclear program and former Deputy Director-General for Safeguards at the International Atomic Energy Agency, France has also maintained "very good intelligence" on Iran's subsequent nuclear work through a large Paris-based Iranian exile community, which includes Iran's former top atomic energy officials, including Akbar Etemad, the founding father of Iran's nuclear program,
Mark Dubowitz — the executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a hawkish think-tank in Washinton — said France was uniquely positioned to spot potential flaws in the agreement because it has an array of officials who have working almost exclusively on nuclear issues for more than a decade and understand both the technical aspects of Iran's nuclear program and the economic impact of the hard-hitting economic sanctions that have been imposed in response.
"On the Iranian side, you've got men who have written books on these issues and forgotten nuclear tricks that many folks on our side haven't even learned," they said. "The only comparably level of expertise on our side is the French. The same people work the technical side and the economic side. On the U.S. side, those issues are handled by different people from different departments."
The French Foreign Ministry, officials say, has a particularly knowledgeable expert on Iran's nuclear program in Martin Briens, who used to run the department that handled nuclear negotiations with Iran and has an encyclopedic knowledge of the evolution of those talks from their beginning to the present.
Dubowitz said Paris deserved credit for helping to block what they see as a deeply flawed deal. Under the terms of the agreement leaked to the press, Tehran would have agreed to keep a half-built reactor at Arak inactive for six months but not halt construction. That, they said, would leave Iran six months closer to having the facility be fully operational. They also fault the agreement for failing to force Tehran to stop all of its uranium enrichment activity or from adding to its large sto
ckpiles of centrifuges, a key part of that program.
Heinonen said allowing more work on Arak would turn the facility into a "fait accompli."
"You become a hostage to Arak," they said. "Once it starts operating there is nothing you can do."
There may also be an element of personal pique in the French position. In September, when the Obama administration began publicly threatening military strikes against the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad after their regime used chemical weapons against their own people, France was the only American ally that promised to take part. Hollande told Le Monde at the time that the chemical weapons attack outside Damascus "must not go unpunished" and that France was "prepared to punish" Assad for the incident.
That made it all the more embarrassing for the French leader when Obama quickly dropped their plans for an American military intervention into Syria and instead cut a chemical weapons deal with the Syrian strongman. The White House move left France isolated when it didn't want to be. France is alone again, but this time it's very much by choice.
Whether it's Google Streetview or Microsoft's Bing Streetside, it's handy to see locations down at street-level. But how would you feel if your car number plate was clearly visible?
Ever used street-level mapping services? I've lost count of the number of times I've done a virtual walk on Google Streetview to save myself from getting lost in real life.
I love street-level imaging, which is put together by fleets of cars driving around taking 360-degree camera shots. And it seems Microsoft loves it too, as it's breaking into this type of service with its own Bing Streetside mapping.
But for many, there's an uncomfortable matter of privacy to consider. Would you want your house displayed online for anyone to see? How about if your car was parked outside?
Your car number plate online
We were contacted by reader Sandrine Gee, after a family member emailed them a picture taken by Bing outside their house.
Them car's registration was plainly visible, as were Sandrine and their two young children as they left their house. Though their faces had been successfully blurred, they had been photographed alongside the family car with its registration number clearly visible, and easily associated with their street address.
Microsoft claims it has ‘developed industry-leading image processing software' to automatically blur faces and number plates, but Sandrine's story shows how easily this automated process can fail.
Microsoft told us the issue rarely crops up. ‘It can happen,' a spokesperson said. ‘The blurring is done automatically, but like all automated systems there's a chance that things will get past.'
We requested that Microsoft blur the image or take it down, and if you find your own details are similarly available, you can request the same (Microsoft's reporting hotline is 0800 881 5372).
How would you feel?
Our personal information is increasingly available online, and the question for all of us, of course, is how does this make us feel?
Sandrine told us they were concerned that their number plate being on display could risk identity fraud. Theoretically, number plates carry a low risk of such fraud, but they can still be exploited when associated with a home address.
If this were my home and my car, how would I feel? In all truth, this isn't so different from someone walking down the street and spotting a car parked outside a house, putting one and one together, and associating the number plate with the address. And I don't waste too many hours fretting about that.
But when our details start cropping up online, it's natural to feel a twinge of concern. Even though I haven't decided how I feel about lapses like this, I do think it's essential that Microsoft responds quickly to anyone who raises a complaint.

4/7/2013 –  They are a bright new talent on chess horizon: Aryan Tari is rated 2293 and does not even have an FM title. But the young Norwegian, whose parents are originally from Iran, scored a sensational 6.0/9 points against a field that included five international grandmasters. Their rating performance was 2585, enough to give them their first GM norm – at the tender age of thirteen.
GM Norm at thirteen – Aryan Tari with 6.0/9
GM Eduardas Rozentalis of Lithuania won the Open Norwegian Championship in Fagernes, but 13-year-old Norwegian Aryan Tari, currently rated 2297, was name of the day when they secured their first grandmaster norm. And it all happened on the same Sunday when Magnus Carlsen gained their most important win of the Candidates tournament in London, in the penultimate round against Radjabov.

Young Aryan Tari, whose parents are from Iran, is clearly a Norwegian chess hope for the future. Their GM norm came surprisingly early, as they are not even and FM yet. Among their countrymen only Magnus Carlsen has achieved GM norms at the age of 13. Tari faced five GMs and three IMs in Fagernes, defeating GMs Misa Pap of Serbia and Norway's second seed Jon Ludvig Hammer, while only losing to Maxim Turov of Russia.
Winners Sergey Volkov, third, Eduardas Rozentalis, first and Simen Agdestein, 2nd place
The veteran Norwegian top player Simen Agdestein (45) performed strongly in a sort of come-back tournament in Fagernes. They only lost the final battle against Eduardas Rozentalis, when a draw would have secured them a clear victory ahead of ten GM colleagues. For next year's chess olympiad host Norway it is good news that Simen Agdestein is seriously running for the team again.
IM Timofey Galinsky of Ukraine (above) gained their second GM norm of the tournament, through their last round victory over top seed GM Jon Ludvig Hammer, who didn't have their best tournament.

Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson's family was granted early access to an unadvertised share sale that allowed them to purchase a stake in Landsbankinn asset Borgun, reports Kjarninn.
In all, Landsbankinn sold 31.5% of Borgun shares in this sale to a number of companies. The largest portion of shares went to Stálskip who purchased 29,43% of the shares.
The second largest portion of shares went to the Finance Minister's uncle and cousin who purchased 19.71% of the shares through their company P126 via parent company, Charamino Holdings Limited, registered in Luxembourg.
According to Kjarninn the sale of these shares in electronic payment solution provider Borgun did not follow any formal sales process and went completely unadvertised.
Additionally, as Borgun is an asset of Landsbankinn – of which the government is the majority owner – the the sale falls under the jurisdiction of the Finance Minister.

“I'm not really conscious of how to provoke interest,” offers Justin Peck, which is a little strange, given just how much interest the choreographer and New York City Ballet dancer is getting these days. They think back to the premiere of one of their early ballets, when a critic cornered him. “He was like, ‘People are going to be into your work, then realize you're not Balanchine and hate on it.' I was just like, ‘Can I go now?' ” Peck, holed up in a Tribeca wine bar on a blustery night, laughs and shakes their head. “The ballet world,” they say, “it's a crazy world.”
That may be, but it's one in which he's managed to thrive. Free of gimmickry, Peck's works uphold and explode classical ballet tenets. Just 27 years old, the San Diego native has already made six pieces for New York City Ballet and was recently named the choreographer-in-residence at the company, where they still dance as a soloist. Their next ballet, set to Aaron Copland's Rodeo, will premiere February 4. Two days later, Magnolia Pictures will release Ballet 422, Jody Lee Lipes's feature-film documentary of the making of Peck's Paz de la Jolla.
“I was surprised by how young I looked,” Peck says of the first time they saw the film. “I realized, Maybe I am sort of a kid. I guess I don't feel young.” Peck does seem older than their years: With their thick-rimmed glasses, polite manner, and mop of wavy brown hair, they have a distinctly '50s-era vibe about him, very much the humble anti-diva shown in Ballet 422. “With Justin,” says Lipes of their decision to make the film, “we wanted to capture that moment in an artist's career when things are starting to happen, but they're still learning.”
Despite Peck's old-hand equanimity, when you watch their ballets, it's impossible to forget that they're made by someone so youthful. Each work displays exhilarating invention, from the way Peck showcases the individual charms of corps de ballet members to the insouciant details they insert at unexpected moments (a boy hopscotching over a row of girls during In Creases). Peck's dancers look like themselves: cool New York millennials, not princes and princesses of some idyllic realm. “He wants people's personalities to shine through,” says City Ballet principal dancer Tiler Peck (no relation). In their choreography, Peck loves off-balance movement and rapid directional changes, like pirouettes that finish askew; imperfections that render traditional steps anew and earn raucous ovations rare at the ballet.
Rare too are the expectations they face. In Ballet 422, at the Paz premiere, a ballet grand dame accosts an awkward Peck, noting that in an upcoming program, it's their name next to Balanchine's and Jerome Robbins's, as if he's joined them in the pantheon. That sort of adulation, especially so early in their career, makes them uncomfortable. “The process,” they tell me, “is more interesting than standing onstage and hearing people applaud.”
Indeed, the ballet world, desperate for an heir to Balanchine and Robbins, tends to deify bright young men, and as it tries to puff Peck up, they seem determined to stay firmly on the ground, so to speak. “I'm not a very good dancer,” they say matter-of-factly when I ask what their flaws are. “My feet don't point far enough, my extension is embarrassing. Dance for me has been hard, because it's a stride for perfection.”
As a choreographer, on the other hand, Peck lets their self-consciousness melt away. “If I get a commission,” they say, “it's like a flood of creative thought and energy.” Albert Evans, a retired City Ballet principal, coaches Peck as a dancer and serves as ballet master for their choreographed works. Watching Peck create, Evans says, is “like putting on new glasses and seeing something for the first time. To have eight dancers put their heads together and stack them on top of each other” — as they do in Peck's Year of the Rabbit — “I don't understand where they get this!”
During the dance-making process, Peck, an admirer of Balanchine's “brilliant architecture,” solicits opinions from people outside the City Ballet sphere like Lipes; their collaborator and friend the singer-­songwriter Sufjan Stevens; and artist Jessica Dessner, whose brother the National's Bryce Dessner, wrote the score for Peck's Murder Ballades. Many of their friends, including their girlfriend, ballerina Patricia Delgado, are dancers at Miami City Ballet, where a new work they made in collaboration with artist Shepard Fairey will debut in March.
That Ballet 422 will be released just after Rodeo's premiere seems auspicious. The film, Peck concedes, shows them at a transitional point, between institutional acceptance and their own wariness of those same institutions. Or, as they put it, he's still “figuring shit out.” Rodeo, a reinterpretation of a score made iconic by Agnes de Mille, will showcase how Peck has grown, not to some level of choreographic perfection but to a new comfort with both their own vision and how others see him.
The tension between those perspectives is still there, though. A couple weeks ago, Peck was in Los Angeles for the premiere of Helix, their newest piece for the L.A. Dance Project. The dance was part of an evening celebrating the city's glitzy Music Center, and the whole thing, recalls Peck, “had this awards-show-tacky vibe. There were violinists inside jeweled pods, and they were floating up and down, playing cheesy music.” Helix, a turbulent piece for six dancers set to music by Esa-Pekka Salonen, was, they say, “definitely different from the rest of the night. I feel like people either thought it was refreshing or were like” — they smile tentatively — “This doesn't fit.”

Mauricio Mendez Lopez was discovered by their niece holding a knife and drinking a glass of their roommate's blood after killing them in their Florida home. Is Twilight to blame for all of this?
Mirella Mendez says that when they discovered Lopez, they were holding a knife and a glass coated in blood and the victim, Macario Luna Cruz, was laying on the floor. Lopez laughed, raised the glass in the air, and said, "This is my secret." Actually, it doesn't appear to be a case of vampirism, but something that was inspired by Mexican folklore: Mendez told police that if you drink the blood of the person you kill, you won't be arrested for the crime. It doesn't work, clearly, since Lopez was arrested while walking through Bartow, Fla., on Wednesday night.
If you think the crime is crazy, just wait until you hear the motive. Lopez, 42, and the victim, Cruz, 32, lived together and Cruz was married to one Lopez's nieces. Cruz then started to have an affair with Mendez, who is also Lopez's niece and the sister of Cruz's wife. Got that?
When Lopez discovered the relationship in late July, they threatened to kill them if it didn't stop. On Sunday, Lopez stabbed Cruz's brother and then went to the apartment they shared and killed Cruz. So, how long do you think it will take them to write the Law & Order: SVU script for this one?

It's been an eventful week for blogger Han Hui Hui.
First, the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) asked them to remove a YouTube video and five Facebook posts which alleged that their criminal conviction over a 2014 protest rally that disrupted a charity event at Hong Lim Park was done so to politically persecute them
The AGC has given them a week, starting from March 13, to take the posts and video down, as well as to publish an apology, or they will be charged with contempt.
Blog post alleging mistreatment
A day after receiving those instructions from AGC, Han published a lengthy blog post – Alone In Cell – giving their account of their court proceedings as well as their incarceration.
They alleged that they were strip-searched, a privacy screen was not used and the search was “done in front of about ten female officers with male officers passing by at the gate.”
They also alleged that inmates were not given toilet paper and that their lunch was cold and had chilli poured all over it.
Han also claimed that they were escorted by “10 police officers at the high court basement and an additional 50 police officers at the state court basement”.
Han's blog post concluded by asking Singaporeans to transfer money to their POSB account to help pay for their S$3,100 fine for causing a public nuisance.
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) responded to Han's allegations saying they were “baseless and false.”
MHA said the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) had reviewed CCTV footage and interviewed relevant officers in relation to Han's lock-up. MHA said Han was not strip-searched and their allegation that male officers walked past while they were searched was not true as Han was in the women's wing of the prison, which was not accessible to male officers. MHA also said a privacy screen was deployed when searches were in progress.
MHA added that “upon request, toilet paper is made available to detainees.” MHA added that “Han could have raised the issues at any time while they were in custody and the SPS would have looked into it. However, they chose not to do so.
Instead, they chose to publish the fabricated, false and misleading accounts on social media.”
MHA's full statement was shared by Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam on Facebook:
Challenging the authorities
Following MHA's statement, Han made multiple Facebook posts challenging the authorities to release CCTV footage of them during the events leading up to and during their lock-up.
They claim there were four searches conducted on them and four corresponding CCTV footage of that.  They are also claiming that there are five CCTV videos of them during their lock-up including one of their supposed solitary confinement.
They claim that the authorities “will never bring out all 4 CCTVs” as no privacy screen was used “in all four searches” and “searches are humiliating and I nearly fell in one of the searches”.
The Facebook posts also included graphics proclaiming “Character assassination by Singapore government controlled mainstream media.”

When Peter Molan, a now-retired scientist and academic in New Zealand, began researching the properties of honey more than 30 years ago, there was little demand for a type made by bees that pollinated the flowers of the native manuka bush.
“It used to be thrown away,” they said. “If you taste genuine manuka honey, it's got a very strong flavour and people didn't like it.”
Then Molan discovered there was something special about manuka honey. It appears to have antibacterial properties, unlike other honeys in the world, and some studies suggested it could heal wounds and help boost the immune system. (Specifically, the antibacterial property found in other honeys comes from hydrogen peroxide, which is broken down quickly in the body, whereas the non-peroxide form found in manuka honey isn't.)
Many of the health claims are still being tested, but once manuka's supposed healing powers became known outside New Zealand, it moved from the margins of the honey world into a globalised, multimillion-dollar industry. Celebrity endorsers like tennis player Novak Djokovic and actor Scarlett Johansson only added to its appeal.
It's like a gold rush going on
Now demand is exploding among the affluent in China, where enduring concerns over food safety have prompted an insatiable appetite for all-natural health food products from abroad. From virtually no imports of New Zealand honey just seven years ago, China has drawn level with Hong Kong as the second largest market in the world, according to government statistics, importing nearly 1,500 tonnes in 2014 — the large majority of which is manuka honey. Taken together, the China and Hong Kong markets far outpace the UK, which has been the world's largest market for a decade but has seen imports steadily decline since 2009.
All told, the total value of New Zealand honey exports reached NZ$187m ($121.5m) in 2014, up from NZ$36m ($23.7m) in 2005. And it could get much bigger: the government's goal is to grow manuka honey into a NZ$1.2bn ($779 million) per year industry by 2028 becoming as valuable to the country as the wine industry.
Spreading the word, one health nut at a time
Walk into any high-end supermarket in Shanghai and it's clear who the target consumer is — with prices running as high as 1,789 renminbi ($279) for a 500g jar of the top-of-the-line manuka honey, it's only the truly well-off who can afford it. The higher prices for manuka worldwide are driven by skyrocketing demand and limited supplies, but imported goods are also generally priced higher in China than other countries, particularly those considered luxury items.
It's viewed the same way you might say Koreans view ginseng — a high-value item that you constantly take for continued good health
Unlike other luxury items, such as a Louis Vuitton bag or a holiday to the Maldives, however, manuka honey isn't considered a vanity purchase or status symbol by consumers, says James Roy, associate principal at the China Market Research Group in Shanghai. “It's viewed the same way you might say Koreans view ginseng — a high-value item that you constantly take for continued good health,” Roy said.
Shirley Kwun, a 29-year-old operations manager in Shanghai, says their mother in Hong Kong started buying manuka honey several years ago as a healthy replacement for sugar in their breakfast porridge. Now Kwun has started buying it herself, as have other members of their family when they visit New Zealand. “My mother was the first to buy flaxseed oil among their friends, so I guess she's kind of a forerunner in these kinds of things,” they said.
Like other health crazes in China, the manuka honey market has grown largely through word of mouth. Provenance matters hugely, too, in a country rife with fakes. As a result, the leading brands have had to adapt their marketing strategies by stocking shops in New Zealand that are popular with Chinese tourists and promoting their honeys on Chinese social media.
“Word of mouth has always been a key driver of our marketing activities,” said Brett Hewlett, chief executive officer of Comvita, New Zealand's biggest manuka honey producer. “[The Chinese] are hugely skeptical of conventional marketing — anything a celebrity would endorse, for instance. The thing they trust more than anything is word of mouth through a friend or relative.”
In May, Comvita reported record profits of NZ$10.2m ($6.6 million) for the most recent fiscal year, up 28% over the previous year. This was driven in part by Chinese tourist demand, with sales in New Zealand jumping 92%, as well as e-commerce sales, which rose by 55%.
On China's Taobao marketplace and Weibo microblogging service, a huge network of informal vendors has sprouted up in recent years to meet the surging demand, with users named “New Zealand Healthy Living” and “Nourishing Life” advertising jars of manuka at a fraction of the shelf price.
Vendors are now on the popular social media app WeChat, too. One seller promises customers that their honey is the real deal because they have a sister in New Zealand who will ship it directly to China, with the all-important tracking numbers.
The price of rapid growth
Counterfeiting has dogged the manuka honey industry in the past, resulting in a warning from Britain's Food Standards Agency two years ago on the misleading and illegal claims made on the labels of manuka honey jars.
New Zealand's leading honey association has tried to safeguard the industry by developing a “Unique Manuka Factor” (UMF) grading system to inform consumers of the purity and quality of the manuka honey in each jar and setting up laboratories in various locations, including the Chinese city of Nanjing, to test imported honey for authenticity.
“That to me is very, very important. We've built that level of credibility,” said John Rawcliffe, head of the UMF Honey Association. “It's like putting the traffic cop on the street — there are times the traffic cop doesn't have to do anything. It's just the presence of this testing facility that matters.”
The spike in demand from China is also putting pressure on producers to keep up. Comvita has had to double the number of hives it owns to 30,000 in the past two years to maintain a steady supply of honey. “We're honestly not able to meet the full demand,” Hewlett admitted.
Other producers are expanding into remote parts of the country where hives must be airlifted by helicopter, Molan says.
“It's like a gold rush going on,” Molan said. “People [in New Zealand] are buying a few hives and sticking them just outside the boundary of any property that's got manuka trees growing on it in the hope of getting a bit of manuka honey from it.”
One thing New Zealand doesn't have to worry too much about is competition; only Australia, where the manuka bush also grows, is a threat. Although the Chinese are reportedly trying to grow another popular foreign health food at home — the maca root, which is native to Peru — Rawcliffe doesn't believe China could start its own manuka industry, given its environment. “If you could transplant New Zealand into China,” Rawcliffe said, “then I would be worried.”

Society elites aren't the only blue bloods. Several species of octopus have blue, rather than red, fluid running through their veins.
The blue comes from a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin, which carries oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream and then to the cells of the octopus's body. Hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein found in the blood of other animals—including humans—serves the same oxygen-transporting function but turns blood red.
Both hemoglobin and hemocyanin release their bound oxygen when they reach tissues that need it.
But for the Antarctic octopus Pareledone charcoti, transporting oxygen via hemocyanin poses problems at subzero temperatures.
That's because in polar waters oxygen binds so tightly to hemocyanin that it doesn't let go very easily. If these tissues can't get oxygen, the octopus will die.
A new study, published March 11 in the journal Frontiers in Zoology, shows that this cold-water critter overcomes the obstacles by producing an overabundance of hemocyanin.
To solve this frigid mystery, study leader Michael Oellermann, an ecophysiologist at the Alfred Wegener Polar Institute in Germany, compared P. charcoti with two other hemocyanin-carrying octopus species that live in warmer waters: Octopus pallidus and Eledone moschata.
They found that on average, P. charcoti had 40 percent more hemocyanin in its blood than either O. pallidus or E. moschata.
"We really weren't expecting to find this," Oellermann said.
In the Clear
Here's another surprise: A variety of animals bleed colors other than red.
The ocellated icefish, for instance, may brush fins with the Antarctic octopus in the same chilly habitat, but its blood is quite different. It runs completely clear.
The polar dweller lacks both hemoglobin and hemocyanin, leaving its blood without any color at all.
"Cold water can hold a lot more oxygen than warmer water. There's enough dissolved oxygen at these depths that the fish doesn't need an active oxygen carrier like hemoglobin," Oellermann said.
The icefish is strange in other ways too. Unlike most other fish, it completely lacks scales.
Scientists believe that the absence of scales helps oxygen diffuse through the icefish's skin, where it's pumped around the body by an unusually large heart.
Going Green
The country of Papua New Guinea is home to the green-blooded skink, which biologist Christopher Austin at Louisiana State University has spent their career studying.
The skink uses hemoglobin to carry oxygen, and as in many animals, the liver breaks down the used hemoglobin into by-products such as bilirubin and biliverdin. Humans normally excrete these by-products into the intestines, since a buildup of them in the blood can cause jaundice or a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes.
The skink, however, seems to thrive with high levels of biliverdin in its blood, which gives the blood a green color.
"If humans had this amount of biliverdin in their blood, they would be dead," Austin said.
Austin is currently working to determine what factors may have forced the skink to adapt to such high biliverdin levels. Their current hypothesis is that the chemical provides protection against parasites like those that cause malaria.
With so many species remaining to be studied, one thing's for sure: There will be blood (research for many years to come).

Australian Labor leader Bill Shorten has challenged a Christian group that fights against equal marriage – while addressing its own conference.
Mr Shorten – who became head of the Labor party last year when former PM Kevin Rudd resigned – was speaking to the Australian Christian Lobby, which fights against same-sex marriage, gay adoption rights, and anti-discrimination laws.
The defiant politician said at the group's conference: “I believe in God and I believe in marriage equality.
“When I hear people invoking scriptures to attack blended families, I cannot stay silent. I do not agree.
“When I see people hiding behind the bible to insult and demonise people based on their sexuality I cannot stay silent, I do not agree.
“When I hear people allege that ‘God tells them' that marriage equality is the first step on the road to polygamy and bigamy and bestiality, I cannot stay silent. I do not agree.”
“These prejudices do not reflect the Christian values I believe in.”
“I believe our current law does exclude some individuals it says to them that your relationship is not equally valued by the state, that your love is less equal under the law.
“We currently have a law that discriminates against adult couples on the basis of who they love.”
Ivan Hinton-Teoh of Australian Marriage Equality said: “It is the first time a leader of either major political party has used the forum to challenge the agenda of the conservative lobby group.
“It is powerful moment in our national history that a political leader, an affirmed Christian, has had both the confidence and conviction to use this forum to reflect the true diversity of Christian views.”
Watch the speech below:
Americans — not uniquely, but powerfully — wallow in political hypocrisy about online rhetoric.
We're not consistent in our arguments about when vivid political speech speech inspires, encourages, or promotes violence. We're quicker to accept that it does when used against our team and quicker to deny it when used on the other team.
We're not consistent in our moral judgments of ugly speech either. We tend to treat it as harmless venting or trolling or truth-telling if it's on our team and as a reflection of moral evil if it's on the other team.
We're not consistent in our arguments about whether online abuse and threats directed at people in the news are to be taken seriously or not. We tend to downplay them when employed against the other team and treat them as true threats when used against our team.
We're not consistent in our arguments about whether calling some individual out by name exposes them to danger. We tend to claim it does when the person supports our team and sneer at the issue when the person supports the other team.
We're not consistent in our treatment of the significance of behavior by obscure individuals. When some obscure person's online speech gets thrust into the limelight, we tend to treat it as fairly representative if they're on the other team and an obvious non-representative outlier if they are on our team.
We're hopelessly bad at applying consistent legal principles to evaluate whether speech is legally actionable depending on which team it comes from.
We're pretty inconsistent in our assessment of what social consequences should flow from ugly speech, with our views of proportionality, decency, and charity diverging widely depending on whether the person at issue is on our team or not.
So it can't be a shock that the reaction to CNN's story about a Redditor is a total shitstorm.
I think it's a legitimate story that the White House plumbs the depths of Reddit for content to post on Twitter. I think it's a legitimate story that the sort of people who post Trump-fluffing memes also post bigoted garbage — that this is the community that the White House looks to for inspiration. I think the existence and nature of sad people like this Redditor — someone who, at the most charitable interpretation, derives pleasure and meaning from pretending to be bigoted — is a legitimate and important story, especially in light of the White House's fondness for them. I think that it's a legitimate and sick-fascinating story to know what sort of person derives pleasure from posting a chart showing the pictures of CNN employees with stars next to the Jews. Do they have a job? A family? How does this hobby impact their life?
I also think that CNN has an absolutely protected First Amendment right to seek their name and publish it if they wish. The First Amendment should place strict limits on CNN's ability to use the power of the state (like discovery in a lawsuit) to unmask an anonymous person, and does. But CNN, and any private individual, has a right to figure it out on their own and talk about it, just like this creepy damaged human has a right to post the Jews-at-CNN chart in the first place.
But there's a difference between legal and moral approval. I defend the Redditor's right to post bigoted garbage but deplore them for doing so. And, under these circumstances, I personally think that it would not be proportional for CNN to use its power to name the person. A number of factors might change my view — it the guy was directing bigoted invective or threats at anyone instead of just posting it in a forum made up of similar losers, if the guy had a position of trust that required treating people equally (like, say, a public official or police officer or teacher), or if the dude was doing something like posting child porn or the sort of creepshots that took down Reddit super-troll Violentacrez.
CNN didn't publish their name. But CNN published this:
CNN is not publishing "HanA**holeSolo's" name because they are a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed their remorse by saying they have taken down all their offending posts, and because they said they are not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. In addition, they said their statement could serve as an example to others not to do the same.
CNN reserves the right to publish their identity should any of that change.
I found this alarming and ugly. CNN should publish the name or not publish the name. For CNN to tell them what they should or shouldn't say in the future, and threaten them that they will reveal their name in the future if they don't like their speech, does not make them sound like journalists. It makes them sound like avenging advocates, and lends substantial credibility to the argument that they pursued them because they posted a GIF about them. I don't know what they actually intended — they've denied intent to threaten and claim this was only to clarify that there was no agreement. If so, that could have been conveyed much less like a threat. However they meant it, this is reasonably interpreted as a warning that the Redditor must speak only as approved by CNN or suffer for it. That's grotesque. Legal, but grotesque.
The internet is, in human terms, very new. We still don't have coherent shared values about how we use it. Our views on ugly internet speech and the proper response to it are particularly confused. As I've argued for a while, the argument "you have to shut up so I can feel safe to speak" is not coherent. "There's absolutely nothing wrong with my speech but there's something wrong with you identifying me as the speaker" is not particularly coherent. "You are silencing free speech by criticizing it" is not coherent. "This speech is insignificant but it's wrong for you to highlight it" is not coherent. "People should be able to post graphics identifying all the Jews at CNN without anyone figuring out who they are and criticizing them by name" is not coherent. Troll visions of free speech — in which society works together harmoniously to ensure that they can post bigotry without any social consequence — is incoherent. (I also think trolls would hate that world if they got it, since their pleasure depends upon people being upset.)
As I said when I wrote semi-anonymously, I think people should be prepared to accept the social consequences of what they've written if someone is able to figure out who they are. But I also think we should consider whether to inflict social consequences when appropriate on people who breach the anonymity of others. Sometimes social consequences — even severe ones — may be appropriate. If some anon is sending death threats, I honestly have no problem with their name being published, whether or not their friends cry "it's just trolling." I'm also not terribly sympathetic to the proposition that I should be able to send abuse to people anonymously — you by the ticket, you take the ride. If someone officially charged with treating people equally posts things suggesting they do not, that seems like a correct time for naming them. Otherwise, though, I think we should talk about whether naming people who act like assholes is proportional or decent. And certainly we should talk about whether it's decent for a major network to threaten to name someone unless they speak acceptably.
None of this means I have to take seriously the hollow fury of everyone who rails at CNN, though.
Edited to add: The notion that it was execs and lawyers who inserted the threat is both comforting (because it means the journalists aren't as foolish or awful as I thought) and horrifying (because it means the execs and lawyers are morons indifferent to the harm they do to their journalists).

Eventing Nation: 2 Horses Pass Away at The Fork
It's been a tough weekend at The Fork (NC), with the tragic loss of two horses — Will Coleman's Conair and Andrew McConnon's Powderhouse. Jenni Autry has the report.
Top: Will Coleman and Conair at The Fork this morning just before the accident. Photo by Jenni Autry.
Via Eventing Nation:
CONAIR
We're heartbroken to confirm that Conair has died following an accident at fence 17 on the Advanced cross-country course at The Fork this morning. Conair looked wonderful at fence 16 when they galloped by me with Will Coleman in the irons, and the accident occurred just seconds later at fence 17, a big table to a cheese wedge. The Fork just released the following statement:
It was it with great sadness that we announce that Conair, ridden by Will Coleman and owned by the Conair Syndicate collapsed and died at The Fork event in Norwood, NC, USA at approximately 9:45 a.m. on the date above. Earlier Will and Conair had a fall on the Advanced cross-country course and Conair proceeded to run back towards the barns. They were stopped and then transported to the barn for veterinary evaluation.
After the preliminary veterinary exam was completed, Conair collapsed and died. Cause of death has not yet been determined.
The entire organizing committee and officials extends its heartfelt condolences to Will Coleman and the Conair Syndicate at this difficult time.
I saw Conair gallop back by the mound complex after the accident, where they were caught by some spectators near the cross-country warmup. They looked fine when I saw him, so it's incredibly shocking to lose them so suddenly. Will was up and OK after the fall, but they have reportedly gone to the hospital with their arm in a sling. We will update you on their status when we know more.
It's heartbreaking to lose any horse, but it stings a bit more when it's one with so much talent and potential. Will just got the horse last year from Rodney Powell, and the partnership had been coming along so nicely. Will and Joey were third in the Fair Hill CCI3* last fall and were meant to go to Rolex for the horse's first four star later this month. It goes without saying that this is a tragic loss for both Will and High Performance eventing.
The EN team extends our deepest condolences to Will, Katie, Shannon and the syndicate members who owned the horse. Rest in peace, Joey.
POWDERHOUSE
Andrew McConnon and Powderhound just show jumped in the CIC2* here at The Fork, and Jessica Bortner-Harris has confirmed the horse collapsed back at the barns and passed away soon after. Andrew was on the horse when they fell, but Jessica confirmed Andrew was not injured in the fall. Everyone is very shaken up back at the barns, and we're sending Andrew our deepest condolences. Rest in peace, Powderhound.
Update 3:35 p.m. EST: Powderhound's passing has been confirmed by a statement released from The Fork. A 15-year-old Australian Sport Horse gelding, “Carlos” was competing in their first CIC2* event this weekend at The Fork. Andrew just took over the ride from Kaitlynn Mosing this past winter, and they were fourth in Preliminary at Pine Top Winter Horse Trials in their first outing together. Andrew and Carlos were most recently seventh in the CIC* at Pine Top Advanced and third in the Intermediate Rider division at Carolina International Horse Trials.
Update 6:15 p.m. EST: Andrew McConnon's Facebook page was just updated with the following statement:
“It is hard to find words adequate enough to express the sorrow felt upon the tragic death of a loved horse and competitive partner, and those that know and love Andrew and Powderhound are indeed without words. Carlos was only in Andrew's barn for a short while, but they were very much loved and very much appreciated for the warhorse they are. They were a wonderful event horse that knew their job and did it well, and we were all looking forward to watching their partnership grow. This tragedy is once again a reminder that we are so lucky to have horses in our lives, and must appreciate them every moment of every day. Hug your horse, and give Andrew a hug as well. Many thanks for all of your kind words.”
Go Conair and Powderhound.
Great songwriting and musicianship does not guarantee that a song will be a hit, so it is wonderful when a recording artist uncovers a musical gem by, well… covering it. When a cover song becomes a hit, the original artist benefits. Often there is a renewed interest in the original artist's work and hopefully (depending on their recording contract) they are also compensated for the use of their song. Here are 10 examples of cover songs and their original versions– we can argue about which version is better, but in each case the cover song is indisputably more famous. In some cases, perhaps you didn't know the song is a cover:
10. All Along The Watchtower
The Cover – Jimi Hendrix
Jimi Hendrix's version of this song appeared on the album Electric Ladyland, the third and final album released by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. It is often noted as an exemplar of the psychedelic rock genre, and was ranked by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 47th greatest song of all time, ranked above such classics as Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire and the Eagles' Hotel California. View the cover versions of these 10 songs at our YouTube Playlist.
The Original – Bob Dylan
The song first appeared on Bob Dylan's album John Wesley Harding in 1967. It was written soon after they had had a motorcycle accident and some claim that its lyrics were inspired by their newfound interest in the bible and have made connections between their words and the book of Isaiah. Unlike Hendrix's electric and psychedelic rock version, the original was folksy and recorded with an acoustic guitar and a harmonica.
9. I Shot the Sheriff
The Cover – Eric Clapton
Eric Clapton released this song on their second album, 461 Ocean Boulevard. They didn't initially plan to include the song on the album, but was eventually convinced by the other band members. It is one of their most popular and well known songs; the only one to reach number 1 on the Billboard top 100.
The Original – Bob Marley
Bob Marley, who wrote the song, released it one year before Clapton in 1973 on the album Burnin'. The album was ranked as the 319th greatest album of all time by Rolling Stone Magazine. In the story of the song, a man admits to killing the Sheriff, but claims they are falsely accused of killing the deputy. The anti-police sentiment in the song was very well received and brought much acclaim to both Marley and Clapton.
8. Oye Como va
The Cover – Santana
Oye Como Va was one of Carlos Santana's most popular songs sung in Spanish released in the 1970's. On the Santana ablum Abraxas, it reached 13 on the Billboard top 100 and was one of the major catalysts for their stardom. Translated literally, it means “listen to how it goes”, but can also mean “how's it going” or “check it out”, depending on the region and context.
The Original – Tito Puente
This song was originally written and recording in 1963 by the Latin jazz musician Tito Puente. It was inspired by an earlier song by a popular Cuban Mumba artist, Israel “Cachao” López. The song has been covered by, and has inspired, several other Hispanic artists.
7. Respect
The Cover – Aretha Franklin
Aretha Franklin released their signature song, Respect , in 1967. It won them a grammy, was seen as a major anthem by the feminist movement, and was ranked by Rolling Stone Magazine as the 5th greatest song of all time, right above Johnny B. Goode and Good Vibrations. R-E-S-P-E-C-T. That spelling was not actually in the original version.
The Original – Otis Redding
Respect was originally written and performed by a man, Otis Redding, in 1965- 2 years prior to Franklin's hit version. Their version is a desperate plea from a man willing to do anything to please their significant other, as long as they get their respect when they get home. And by respect, they mean, ….well… uh. Yeah. It was a euphemism. Aretha Franklin's version was basically the same idea from the opposite side: if you want some, you have to respect them
6. Cocaine
The Cover – Eric Clapton
Clapton came out with their version of this song in 1977. Clapton has received criticism in the past for the song, but they claim it is an anti-drug song. Because of this, they eventually inserted the lyric “that dirty cocaine” to make the previously ambiguous message more clear. It peaked at 30 on the US Billboard charts; however, it has become one of their most recognizable songs, called by Allmusic “among [Clapton's] most enduring popular hits.”
The Original – JJ Cale
Cocaine was written by JJ Cale, a southern blues and rockabilly musician, about a year before Clapton's version came out . Their version did reach number one on the music charts… but only in New Zealand. Cocaine was actually only one of several songs Clapton borrowed from Cale, including “ After Midnight” and “Travelling Light.”
5. Hound Dog
The Cover – Elvis Presley
Most people don't really listen to this song any more, but pretty much everyone has heard of it. It was Elvis's trademark song: one of the most popular American singer's greatest hits. Their version of the song was ranked number 19 on the Rolling Stones “500 greatest songs of all time.”
The Original – Big Mama Thornton
Hound dog was a song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. The first recording of the song was by Willie Mae “Big Mama” Thornton, an African-American rhythm and blues singer, in 1952. They also recorded the song “Ball and Chain”, which later became a hit for Janis Joplin.
4. You've Got a Friend
The Cover – James Taylor
This song was released by James Taylor on their 1971 album Mud Slide Jim and the Blue Horizon. It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four on the UK singles charts. They eventually won a grammy award for it.
The Original – Carole King
This song was originally written and performed by Carole King. It was on their album Tapestry, which came out earlier in the same year that Taylor's version would be made famous. Before and after this, King and Taylor were friends and would occasionally perform together. They would actually often sing the song together.
3. I Will Always Love You
The Cover – Whitney Houston
Whitney Houston recorded their version of this song in 1992 for the soundtrack of their first film appearance, The Bodyguard. They were going to sing Jimmy Ruffin's What Becomes of the Brokenhearted, but decided not too when they found out it was also going to be in the movie Fried Green Tomatoes. Them version was a huge success, eventually appearing at number 68 on Billboard's “Greatest Songs of All Time.”
The Original – Dolly Parton
Dolly Parton wrote this song in 1973 and released it as a single a year later. It had a significant amount of success on the monthly country charts, but very limited recognition otherwise. They re-recorded it about a decade later to include it in the soundtrack for a movie they were in, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.
2. Blinded by the Light
The Cover – Manfred Mann's Earth Band
Manfred Mann's Earth Band released Blinded by the Light on their album The Roaring Silence in 1976. It reached #1 on both Billboard's Hot 100 and on the Canadian RPM chart. The original album recording length was over 7 minutes, but is usually cut down to around 3 on the radio. It was their first and greatest hit.
The Original – Bruce Springstein
It was originally written and performed by Bruce Springsteen on their debut album Greetings from Asbury Park N.J. Their band's version was unsuccessful and did not appear on any music charts. You may know this song from it's famously misheard lyric. At one point in the song it sounds like he's singing “wrapped up like a douche,” but the actual lyric is wrapped up like a deuce, a reference to a 1932 Ford.
1. Hurt
The Cover – Johnny Cash
Hurt was one of Johnny Cash's last hits before they died in 2003. It was released in 2002 on the album American IV: The Man Comes Around, when Cash was 71 years old. Cash's version did fairly well on the charts in the US and UK, but for some reason got all the way to number 8 on the Norway charts. The song made it onto 2 “songs of the decade” lists, 15th on The Rolling Stones list, and 2nd on Country Music Television's. In addition, they won several awards for their music video, including #1 on CMT's 100 Greatest Country Music Videos in 2003, the best video of the year at the 2003 Grammys, and best video of all time by NME in 2011.
The Original – Nine-Inch Nails
Cash was covering a song by the industrial rock band Nine-Inch Nails. They changed the lyric “I wear this crown of sh*t” to “I wear this crown of thorns.” The original version, written by Nine-Inch Nails' Trent Reznor, was released on the 1994 album Downward Spiral and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Rock Song in 1996.

In the face of renewed and spreading harassment and violence, the International Socialist Organization appeals for a large and united resistance against the far right.
WHEN RIGHT-WING thugs feel free to harass and murder, and a leading voice of the U.S. left faces racist death threats, the need for solidarity and activism against the far right could not be more urgent.
Amid the surge of violent hate crimes since Donald Trump took office came the May 20 murder of an African American student, Richard Collins III in Maryland, on the eve of their graduation. Collins was killed on the University of Maryland campus by Sean Urbanski, a known racist who was identified as a participant in the "Alt-Reich" Facebook group.
The horror over that killing was still fresh when another Nazi, Jeremy Joseph Christian, stabbed to death two men, Ricky John Best and Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, and badly wounded a third, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, in Portland, Oregon. Christian attacked them for defending two women, one of them wearing a hijab, who Christian had harassed and abused on a commuter train.
Politicians and the mainstream media typically try to dismiss such killings as the acts of mentally ill individuals acting alone, rather than evidence of the rising level of racist violence in society.
Students marching against racist hate crimes at University of California at San Diego
But even the pro-Trump New York Post had to report earlier this year that the murder by stabbing of Timothy Caughman, an African American man, came at the hands of an avowed white supremacist, James Harris Jackson--who told police that they traveled to New York City specifically to kill Black people.
Meanwhile, college campuses like the University of California at Berkeley have become a focal point for the extreme right, which seeks physical confrontation with anti-racists and the left under the guise of demonstrating for "free speech." Conservative commentators like Fox News and not a few more liberal media outlets have taken the far right's claims at face value, criticizing the left instead.
That is the frightening context for scores of death threats directed at author, activist and Princeton University professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor this week after Fox News and other right-wing media targeted them following their commencement address at Hampshire College, in which they denounced Trump as a racist and sexist.
As Taylor wrote in an announcement on social media that they would withdraw from several speaking engagements:
Fox did not run this story because it was "news," but to incite and unleash the mob-like mentality of its fringe audience, anticipating that they would respond with a deluge of hate-filled e-mails--or worse. The threat of violence, whether it is implied or acted on, is intended to intimidate and to silence... The cancelation of my speaking events is a concession to the violent intimidation that was, in my opinion, provoked by Fox News. But I am releasing this statement to say that I will not be silent. Their side uses the threat of violence and intimidation because they cannot compete in the field of politics, ideas and organizing. The true strength of our side has not yet been expressed in its size and breadth, and so they believe they are winning. We have to change this dynamic and begin to build a massive movement against racism, sexism, and bigotry in this country. I remain undaunted in my commitment to that project.
THE MURDERS in Maryland and Oregon and the harassment Taylor has faced are not random events. They are political acts. This is terrorism, committed by those who feel confident to act on their racist and reactionary views at a time when the Trump White House includes figures like Steve Bannon, whose Breitbart News gave a "platform" to the "alt-right"--which includes Klan, Nazi and other far-right elements attempting to rebrand themselves as "white nationalists."
In a country founded on the genocide of Native Americans, the enslavement of Africans and the oppression of nonwhite immigrants, racist violence has deep roots. It expresses itself in many ways, including the wildly disproportionate numbers of killings and arrests of African Americans by police, as even the U.S. Department of Justice has been forced to acknowledge in its review of policing in numerous cities such as Chicago.
Central to this history of racist violence is the long tradition of white supremacist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan, as well as Nazi groups. These elements have often tried to give themselves a mainstream cover--as with Klansman David Duke's 1991 campaign for governor of Louisiana, or, more recently, Richard Spencer's National Policy Institute, whose supporters celebrated Trump's election with a Nazi salute.
But the Nazis inevitably reveal their true agenda through violence --for example, Dylan Roof's 2015 massacre of nine people in a historic Black church in Charleston, South Carolina.
Now, other racists are following Roof's example by threatening people of color, Muslims and anyone else who challenges their agenda. At a time when the president of the United States calls for banning Muslims from entering the U.S., while gutting civil rights protections and deporting immigrants en masse, it's little wonder that the far right feels emboldened--and that some white supremacists act on their threats, such as the racist who shot two Indian engineers, killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounding Alok Madasani, in a Kansas bar.
VIOLENCE AND intimidation must be met with solidarity and a systematic defense of those under attack, whether it is well-known activists like Taylor or the random Muslims, African Americans and immigrants that the Nazis target in the streets.
In taking on this challenge, we can draw on the U.S. left's long tradition of resisting right-wing violence. It ranges from the anti-fascist workers' defense guards of the 1930s to the Deacons of Defense and other Black self-defense groups that provided protection for the civil rights movement of the 1960s against the Klan.
Recent decades have seen more modest but extremely important organizing against the far right, such as the effort in the 1990s by the Midwest Network to Stop the Klan to keep organized white supremacists from getting a foothold in Iowa and other Midwestern states.
Now the violent far right is back--and bigger and more lethal than at any time in decades. Fascists are attempting to use the rightward lurch in U.S. politics to market themselves as mainstream. While they portray themselves as champions of the "white working class," they are the avowed enemy of all genuine working-class organizations as opponents of the totalitarian order they seek.
The ISO appeals to left-wing, labor and anti-racist organizations of all currents to unite and take mass action against this surge of right-wing violence and fascist organization.
Only by confronting these elements can we expose their real agenda of oppressing the vulnerable and destroying democracy. They will not go away if we ignore them. On the contrary, they will use every opportunity to advance--which means more racism, more murder, more terror.
We can't let them get away with it. Defenders of social justice in Portland, Oregon, are organizing a demonstration on June 4 as a counterprotest against the far right to show that the bigots are a tiny, hateful minority. Two days later, on June 6, anti-racists will gather at the Plymouth Congregational United Church of Christ to hear for a town hall meeting to reflect on the murder of Richard Collins III, with featured speakers to include Rev. Graylan Hagler, anti-death penalty activist Shujaa Graham, and author and activist Brian Jones.
These should be the first of many such mobilizations. Join us in taking a stand in solidarity with the oppressed--and organizing a fight for justice and equality for working people.
Crane Clan Characters
1 Cost Characters
There are two 1 Fates cost characters from the Dynasty deck. The Doji Whisperer and Asahina Artisan have a clear focus on Political conflicts with both able to contribute an impressive 3 Political skill for their relatively low cost. While the Doji Whisperer has it as a base skill the Asahina Artisan has an ability that requires bowing to give another Crane character +3 Political skill. The drawback here is that the Artisan needs another character to target, alone the Artisan is effectively 0 skill. The ability does let the Artisan stay out of conflicts only using the ability when needed. In a scenario where you have two Doji Whisperers and one Asahina Artisan, you can attack politically with one Whisperer and if you don't need the Artisan's boost it will be there when your second Whisperer defends. If you don't use the Artisan's ability then you will have 2 glory unbowed to contribute for the Imperial favour.
2 Cost Characters
There are five 2 Fate cost characters. Brash Samurai, Daidoji Nerishma, and Cautious Scout provide a Military base missing from the 1 cost characters. Brash Samurai and Savvy Politician demonstrate honoring characters as a focus for the Crane clan, useful in both boosting skill and gaining honour. The Doji Gift Giver provides an extra Courtier and has an ability that bows opponents.
Daidoji Nerishma is above the curve with 3 military and 1 political for 2 fate. They have an excellent dynasty acceleration ability which helps provide options during the dynasty phase and dig for extra copies of uniques for free fate. Notably, their ability should not be used when you have the initiative as the extra action it requires denies you the opportunity to gain a fate from passing first. In those cases, the ability should be used after the Dynasty phase to improve Dynasty card cycling. As broken provinces get discarded anyway, using their ability on a broken province is a risk it might get you a useable holding or you could end up losing a card you were hoping for next turn.
The Brash Samurai is a 2 cost Bushi with 2 military, 1 political, and 2 glory. These are typical skills for a character of this cost. The Brash Samurai sets themselves apart by having an ability that honors them when they are your own participating character. This means the Brash Samurai is a 4 military and 3 political character who can take provinces. That they can easily become honored helps power up cards we will see later such as Voice of Honor and Noble Sacrifice.
The Cautious Scout a 2 military, 0 political, 1 glory character. When this character is attacking alone, the province they are attacking is considered blank. This makes them a useful scout to send into a province with minimal risk. At 2 military they can break provinces with a single boost, a Banzai! or Fine Katana for example. They do need to be attacking by themselves for their ability to work. This solo hero idea also appears with the Brash Samurai. As both are vulnerable to Assassination you don't really want to attach lots of cards to them. For Crane, political conflicts are the priority, characters like Cautious Scout and Brash Samurai allow the Crane to use military conflicts to threaten, win rings, and scout ahead of the political conflicts to come.
The Doji Gift Giver has been somewhat divisive with some players loving it and others disliking it. The cost of giving a fate to your opponent is pretty rough, and the target of the bowing is decided by your opponent. Those who do like them point out that the ability, when used at the right time, is very strong and can win a conflict. The mere presence of the Doji Gift Giver on the board forces your opponent to pause before every conflict to account for them
The Savvy Politician is a 2 cost Courtier with 1 military, 2 political, and 1 glory. When the Politican is honored you can choose another character and honor that character also. This makes them a perfect target for Way of the Crane getting an extra character honored. Although their glory is only 1, this can be considered a free +1/+1 and a free honor. Like the Brash Samurai, this ability helps the Crane keep an honored board to keep Voice of Honor active and to use Noble Sacrifice.
The 1 and 2 cost characters are very defining for a clan. They provide extra characters to fill out the board often only staying in play for a single turn. From the traits, we can see that Courtiers are going to be a primary focus for the Crane clan. For Courtiers we know there is For Shame! and Outwit, both excellent cards. There are two Bushi a trait mainly useful for Rout. There is a 1 cost Shugenja, the Asahina Artisan, with this the Crane clan may be able to run one or two cards such as Cloud the Mind but will be unable to reliably play cards requiring Shugenja.
3 Cost Characters
Kakita Kaezin seems like an excellent card, they have 3 military, 2 political, and 2 glory so they are well rounded. Their ability is a duel, which has always been a popular with the Crane.  They are an excellent defender. Drop a weapon or honour them to 5 Military and then defend with Kaezin and challenge your opponent. Your opponent does get to pick the defender, but if Kaezin wins, they send everyone but Kaezin and their opponent home. At worst, Kaezin goes home after losing the duel, if they were unbowed they return home unbowed ready to assign to a new conflict. Unfortunately their send home does not bow characters, leaving them ready to defend or attack again in another conflict type. This puts Kaezin in a class similar to many of the other Bushi in the Crane clan, solo heroes rather than team players. Kaezin can go into any conflict and with a little setup, turn it into a 1 on 1 battle where hopefully Kaezin has the edge. Unfortunately, there is only so much room for heroes in the Crane clan and often Kaezin is edged out by the Brash Samurai and Cautious Scout for that role.
Kakita Asami has decent stats of 1 military, 2 political, and 2 glory but where they really shines is their ability. If they are in a political conflict and you have more political skill than your opponent, something common for the Crane, they can take one honour from your opponent and give it to you. As this exact effect is one of the options for the ring of air, they are essentially giving you an extra ring benefit. Due to the strength of their ability, it is unlikely you would want to assign them to a military conflict, which does mitigate their low military skill somewhat.
Doji Challenger has a balanced stat line that makes them equally good in military and political conflicts, something which will be enhanced once they are honoured and their 2 glory is added to the skills. The ability is only useable on the attack which is a surprise for the Crane clan. The ability, which drags an opponent into the conflict, is an impressive denial ability as conflict resolution will bow the target preventing it from assigning to another battle. Them ability does not work on characters who have — for the current battle but there should be plenty of other targets. This lets them drag Kisada into political conflicts and drag Shoju into military ones, it forces the Lion's Pride Brawler into defensive battles and can
In the 4 cost range, Crane has two characters, Guest of Honor and Asahina Storyteller. Both characters are Courtiers and have 4 political skill reaffirming those twin clan focus. Guest of Honor has a quite powerful effect preventing your opponent from playing event cards during conflicts. This significantly limits the options of the opponent and gives the Crane player increased confidence in whether they can win a conflict or not. As many of the ways to deal with a character are actual event cards, the Guest of Honor is incredibly hard to deal with. This action prevention appears to be a Crane clan theme as we will see when we look at the Cranes conflict deck.
The Asahina Storyteller in addition to being a Courtier is also a Shugenja, assisting the Asahina Artisan in opening up some Shugenja specific cards. The Storyteller's ability generates conflict card draw, a limited commodity for decks choosing to honor run as they are typically bidding 1 during the card draw phase. The ability requires honoured characters, something the Crane are going to have. As a 4 cost character however, the Storyteller is not offering a lot. The 4 political skill is perfect to take provinces with and the dual traits of Courtier and Shugenja is quite flexible, but the ability is somewhat conditional and doesn't seem to have the impact you would expect from a 4 cost character. The Storyteller will certainly make it into decks which use the Shugenja trait and may be useful in decks looking for card draw, but I would expect the Asahina Storyteller to be a very tempting card to cut.
Doji Hotaru is the first clan champion we have seen and does not disappoint, they are more than the ‘very good' their father reprimands them with. At 5 cost they have 3 Military Skill and 6 Political skill with 3 Glory. Given the Crane clan's focus on honoring characters, we expect that 3 Glory will quickly turn into a +3/+3 bonus. Doji Hotaru's ability is to resolve the ring ability of a ring you claim during a political conflict. This means, if you win on the attack you can trigger the ring ability a second time. Resolving any of the rings twice in one turn is amazing. While it is possible to use their reaction in defense, as the rings are all phrased to benefit the attacker it is unlikely this will be of help.
Like all of the clan champions, they clearly are worth the investment if they appear on turn 1. Although the 5 cost is significant, the unique status of Doji Hotaru is a considerable bonus. If Hotaru is recruited turn 1 with 2 Fate on her, there will be another 15 cards of the Dynasty deck revealed before they finally leaf play giving around a 60% chance of another copy being revealed keeping them around for another turn. Hotaru on the board for four turns should make a powerful impact. It may end up a serious option to mulligan for a clan champion in the hopes of getting it first turn (~50% chance). Then discard aggressively to get an extra copy.
The last two cards from the Dynasty side are the holding Artisan Academy and The Art of Peace which is the Crane unique province. The Academy has a useful card draw ability allowing the top card of your conflict deck to be played in the conflict phase as if it was in your hand. You can choose to use the Artisan Academy's action before a conflict, within or after a conflict. Activating it before a conflict reveals the card to your opponent and gives them the chance to play around the card. If you reveal it during a conflict, cards which cannot be played in conflicts such as Height of Fashion have to stay on top of your deck until the after the current conflict. Nonetheless, it does provide cards which will be valuable for a deck attempting to run by honor.
The Crane province, The Art of Peace, has a healthy province strength of 4 which is better than average. The ability on it only triggers when the province is broken, so it is no help in defending itself. The benefit is quite strong. Assuming the attackers are 1 glory and the Crane defenders are 2 there will be a massive shift across the board, and it will push the game nearer to a dishonour or honour victory. Getting a good use out of it can be tricky though, it is rare that you could defend with all your Crane characters as it would leave you open for your opponent's second attack. The characters who were in the conflict will end up bowed, so they will not be useful for the remainder of the turn.
Rzeszów archaeologists study Thracian burial ground in Romania
Archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology, University of Rzeszów together with foreign partners study vast necropolis consisting of nearly 100 mounds, erected in the 1st millennium BC in Teliţa-Celic Dere in the south-east of Romania.
The sixth season of excavation ended in early October. Luckily for archaeologists, the studied cemetery adjoins a settlement, which will allow the researchers to explore in depth the contemporary community.
"It used to be a place of great strategic and trade importance - told PAP Dr. Tomasz Bochnak from the Institute of Archaeology, University of Rzeszów. - Not far from there was a ford, which was the last passage through the lower Danube. Further to the east the delta started and crossing was no longer possible."
According to the researcher, the place had already been mentioned by the "father of history" - Herodotus, who wrote that the Persian king Darius, preparing an expedition against the Scythians in 512 BC, moved the army through the Bosphorus and to the lower Danube. Researchers believe that the trail of Darius led through the valley above which the burial ground is located.
The excavations of burial mounds show that the place had been a cultural melting pot for several centuries. Scythian and Greek influences overlapped in the region, which archaeologists see in the objects excavated from ancient tombs.
"There is no clear answer to the question of who was buried in the mounds" - said Dr. Bochnak. "The general name of the peoples who lived in the eastern and central parts of the Balkan Peninsula in the first millennium is the Thracians. These tribes had frequent contacts with the Greeks, and later the Romans" - explained the scientist.
The area where the cemetery is located, Dobrogea, was called "Little Scythia" (which indicates a significant influence of the nomadic people), and a few dozen kilometres to the southeast, on the Black Sea, Greek colonies were located.
"We believe that the settlement complex in Teliţa-Celic Dere is one of the most important sites in Dobrogea, documenting the penetration of these diverse influences. The purpose of our expedition is to determine the range of sites, inventory barrows and study those previously unexplored" - said Dr. Bochnak.
Scientists were intrigued by mound concealing two graves - burial of a young boy whose skull shows signs of trepanation. After cremation, the remains of the deceased were placed in the lateral part of the extensive mound. In the central part, the archaeologists found only unburned legs of another deceased.
"The rest of the body had been removed, but it was not a robbery, only part of a funeral ritual, as in the burial pit remained a short sword typical for the Scythians, and dozens of arrowheads. Probably soon after the funeral, the grave was opened and a large part of the body of the deceased removed" - theorised the researcher.
This year, researchers studied a mound, which turned out to be empty. It turns out that approximately 30 percent mounds of Celic Dere are cenotaphs, structures similar to graves, but devoid of human remains. Dr. Bochnak believes that they could belong to the people whose bodies could not be buried, like people who drowned or were killed in battle.
Polish team of researchers also participated in excavations within the settlement. The researchers wanted to ensure that its residents lived in the times when the necropolis was active. First results indicate a positive answer.
Head of the project, in which Polish archaeologists participate, is Prof. Valeriu Sîrbu from the Museum in Brăila. Also involved are archaeologists and geophysicists from Digital Domain SRL and Vasile Pârvan Institute of Archaeology of the Romanian Academy in Bucharest, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and the Museum of Tulcea.

It's not possible to do much about income taxes, or the taxes we're forced to pay on “our” property in order to maintain the fiction we – rather than the government – “own” it. These taxes eviscerate the “freedoms” which “the troops” are purportedly fighting for and make a mockery of the annual summer celebration whose name I will not mention – much in the same way that sitting on Santa's lap and dragging a pine tree into the living room makes a mockery of another day.
As the late great social critic George Carlin once put it, you have the freedom to chose Coke – or Pepsi. Chevy – or Ford. And that's pretty much the extent of your freedoms. What “the troops” are fighting for is something rather different. You might consult Smedley Butler (see here) to learn about the what.
But there are ways of fighting back – without actually fighting. That – actually fighting – would be stupid at this point, in the same way that it would be stupid for most of us to get into the ring with Brock Lesnar. I've come up with a better way – a passive way.
Let forgetfulness be your ally.
And – use their own “laws” to your advantage.
I simply stopped renewing/paying the “registration” fee (another of the state's euphemisms for “tax,” which is itself a euphemism for legalized theft) they insist I “owe” each year, endlessly, in order to maintain the fiction that the vehicles I paid for are actually mine to own and operate. This keeps roughly $60 per year, per vehicle in my pocket – which adds up when you have several vehicles, as I do. Several of these mostly sit. And of course, I can only drive (or ride) one at any given time. Yet, they expect me (and you) to pay, pay, pay just the same.
And here's some good news: Unlike declining to pay the income or property tax, “forgetting” to renew vehicle registration won't put your life in peril. The very worst that may happen is that one of the state's collectors of revenue (i.e., a cop) will notice an out-of-date registration and issue you a befehl – and order to pony up what you “owe.” You will – usually – not be caged or killed for this “offense.”
If you've managed to avoid paying the tributum for several years before you're noticed, the math adds up in your favor – particularly in the case of people who have multiple vehicles. The cop might notice the one you happen to be driving that day – but the others are safe, assuming they are in your garage and away from prying eyes.
Just be sure to keep your insurance up to date – as there are severe repercussions for “forgetting” to renew that. And, they actively check. With out of date tags/registration, you may be able to go years without a worry.
Or, go “antique.”
In some states – my home state, for instance – one can buy permanent registration Antique Vehicle tags for a car that is 25 years old or older. There is no annual registration renewal fee. The tags are valid (i.e., your permission slip is good) in perpetuity.
Even better, in most cases, vehicles with “Antique” tags are exempted from the obnoxious rigmarole required of everyone else – you know, being forced wait online once a year and then hand over “your” car to a stranger with an air gun and greasy paws, so that they can “inspect” it for “safety” and “emissions.” After which you “owe” them another $20 or whatever the “fee” happens to be.
Get antique plates and you're free of this albatross – legally free.
There is a catch, of course. Technically, you're not “allowed” to drive a vehicle with “Antique” tags on a regular basis; e.g., as your daily to-work-and-back car. But as a practical matter, it is pretty easy to bob and weave the law. Just avoid driving the same route regularly – and be on the lookout for the revenue collectors (i.e., cops). And of course, don't drive a Panther Pink AAR ‘Cuda, either. Go for something low profile that will blend into the crowd.
Or, just get “Farm Use” tags.
These are even better tags than “Antique” tags, for two reasons: First, they allow you regular use – ostensibly, “to and from the farm, to pick up farm supplies” – and so on. Second, they fit better if the vehicle is old and beat up, an old beat up truck, especially. And what qualifies as a “farm”? It can be as little as a backyard vegetable garden or chicken coop. Anything that is plausibly agricultural. You use the vehicle to pick up/deliver seeds or plants, or bedding for the chickens, or eggs – and so on. Work it.
As with “Antique” tags, “Farm Use” tags may require as a condition of obtaining them that you have another vehicle that's registered normally. But – inside tip – the “vehicle” can be a motorcycle. Or even a scooter. A 1982 Honda CB550 is as much a “vehicle” – as far as the law goes – as a 2014 Honda Accord. But guess which one costs less to register (and insure)…. ?
Speaking of old cars – driving one (antique-tagged or not) is a fantastic way to dodge – or at least, greatly reduce – the fleecing you'd otherwise face for the privilege of being allowed to temporarily possess and operate a new car. If you live in a state that has a “personal property tax” on motor vehicles. This is typically assessed annually – and based on the current retail market value of whatever you happen to be driving. If you happen to be driving a brand-new $40,000 SUV, you could dun for several hundred dollars every year, just because you happen to have a new(er) vehicle in the garage. This can easily amount to thousands of dollars over a period of several years.
If, instead, you go out and buy an older car – especially a “beater,” a downtrodden older car – your annual tributum will be much lower. And – here's the good part – this tributum is not based on the actual condition (and thus, value) of your particular older car.
Do you see where I am going with this?
If you're mechanically hip (unlike most Clovers) you could buy a distressed older car for a few hundred bucks (and pay next to nothing in sales tax, by the way) and then discretely fix it up in your garage. Even if you were to replace the entire drivetrain with brand-new components, restore the body and interior to as-new condition, as far as the cowheads at the DMV are concerned, it's just an old whatever-it-is . . . and the tax will be the same (low) hit you'd pay for the same car in barely-operable “beater” condition.
This, folks, is a start.
We can't fight them openly – yet – but that doesn't mean we can't fight them in our own way. Which brings up a story.
After World War II, a German general described the Wehrmacht's fight against the Soviet Union as akin to a mighty elephant battling a horde of ants. The elephant might trample millions of “ants,” the general explained. But in the end, the ants will overwhelm them just the same.
It's a lesson we “ants” could learn from.

For those who find success outside of New Zealand it's considered poor form to criticise the mother country. The job of an international success is to act as a salesperson rather than a citizen. Arguably this was as true for Katherine Mansfield as it is for Eleanor Catton. So when Catton – author of The Luminaries and winner of the Man Booker Prize – ignored their duty to boost the national ego, choosing to gently criticise the national condition and ‘neoliberal' politicians instead, the political Right flew into a kind of rage.
One right-wing talkback host took to air to condemn Catton as a ‘traitor' and an ‘ungrateful hua' (hua being a Māori pejorative pronounced like ‘hoor', the Scottish take on whore). One right wing columnist tweeted their disgust calling Catton ‘just another sanctimonious narcissistic no-nothing leftie greenie' (sic). National Party Prime Minister John Key suggested Catton lacked ‘respect‘ and should stop ‘mixing politics with some of the other things that she's better-known for'.
You may have the impression Catton committed some national sin, and you might right – but only if it is a national sin to criticise the powerful. Or perhaps it's just considered inappropriate to step outside the self-contained communities of the literary classes and venture a view on politics. Catton, in an interview with Livemint at the Jaipur Literary Festival Catton, certainly offered a view:
New Zealand, like Australia and Canada, [is dominated by] these neoliberal, profit-obsessed, very shallow, very money-hungry politicians who do not care about culture. They care about short-term gains. They would destroy the planet in order to be able to have the life they want. I feel very angry with my government.
Catton is hardly advancing a new or particularly devastating critique. What, then, explains the vicious response? Beneath the barely concealed misogyny, the ad hominem attacks and the official disapproval is a very clear message: the role of the writer is not political. The establishment will acknowledge society's writers and intellectuals, and might even grant them a form of collective importance, yet the writer and intellectual must be denied a private voice.
How dare they offer a view outside of the role we have assigned her! The effect of denouncing the writer's migration from the strictly literary to the political is to transform the writer's role from a critical one to a politically neutral one. Underneath the criticisms of Catton the person is the idea that the duty of the novelist is merely to entertain: the writer is defined only by their economic function. The writer works not for citizens but for consumers, and passive consumers at that. If Catton can be confined to mere entertainer then their political views lose their force.
Which only goes some way to explaining why a number of Right-wing figures were so vicious in their condemnation. But Catton also offered something critiques of neoliberalism generally lack in New Zealand, Australia and Canada: respectability. Thus their views arrive with far more force than criticisms of neoliberalism that are offered on obscure blogs and in academic journals whose circulations are pathetically small. The viciousness, then, sought to upend Catton from Man Booker Prize winner – and thus a respectable member of the establishment – to a national ‘traitor' who is only good for writing fiction.
The consequences of this for writing and thinking in public seem quite frightening. The art of thinking in public is, I think, a confidence trick. This is especially true for public thinkers who, like Catton, come from marginalised groups. For women in public (especially women writing online) there are the everyday intimidations like the invitations to sex – and the consequent threats of rape – but there are also the threats that we find harder to name, like the bullying attitudes of the right-wing media folk who ‘went after' Catton. Not with the crude tools of the internet commenter, but with word plays on radio – ‘hua' vs ‘hoor' – and the privilege of the press conference, like Key's suggestion Catton should stick to their knitting, so to speak.
It all serves a prosaic function – the quickest way to render a critique meaningless is to isolate the critic – but it also has an effect much harder to quantify: how many women will be discouraged from thinking in public? After all, Key's government has form attacking women who criticise it. One critic, academic and former New Zealander of the Year Dame Anne Salmond was labelled ‘shrill' and their criticisms of government spying laws were compared to ‘McCarthyism' and ‘Nazi Germany'. Actor Keisha Castle-Hughes, the youngest Oscar nominee for Best Actress, was told to ‘stick to acting' after campaigning for climate change action.
There may be no greater endorsement of the public intellectual and the activist than to invite the contempt of the establishment. But it would also be reckless to refuse to recognise how insidious the attacks against Catton could be. Why would anyone contemplate a career as a writer or a public thinker want to enter such a hostile environment? The fact that we have to even ask this question may confirm Catton's original critique: that New Zealand, Australia and Canada are dominated by neoliberalism, where the writer's role is confined to entertainment and their worth is measured in sales. To then deny the writer their political voice is one of the greatest triumphs of a neoliberal society.

When you think of the top science universities in the U.S., schools like MIT and Caltech may jump to mind. But perhaps the most envied science program in the country is at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. That's where Freeman A. Hrabowski III, 61, has spent 20 years as president turning a humble commuter school into one of the nation's leading sources of African Americans who get Ph.D.s in science and engineering. The college's Meyerhoff Scholars program  which initially targeted black men but is now open to all applicants  creates a highly structured (no phones or Facebook allowed during boot camp) and supportive experience for math and science students, almost all of whom not only graduate but also go on to grad school. Hrabowski, who was jailed at the age of 12 for five days for participating in a civil rights protest in Birmingham, Ala., where Bull Connor spat in their face, finished college at 19 and got their Ph.D. at 24. Now, as an adviser to the National Academies, he's devoted to helping others succeed, in school and beyond.

A sheriff told bowling club president Thomas Cook their claims were 'incredible' and banned them from the road.
A bowling club president who claimed raspberries made them drunk before they went out driving a taxi was banned from the road for 18 months.
Thomas Cook blamed a large pot of raspberries for making them more than double the drink drive limit but a sheriff told them their excuse was "incredible".
Former Royal Marine Cook said they had been teetotal for 50 years but had unwittingly eaten raspberries which were equivalent to ten pints of beer.
However, Sheriff Lindsay Foulis dismissed Cook's bizarre claim and rejected their special reason for non-disqualification plea at Perth Sheriff Court.
They banned Cook, of Whitecraigs Road, Cupar, Fife, and fined them £800. Sheriff Foulis said: "I find it virtually incredible that a man who is almost 70 and has the experience of life of someone that age can effectively consume the equivalent of two bottles of wine or ten pints of beer in an hour and get into a car unaware their ability to drive is affected.
"I would have thought it was most unusual that if your account was correct, then when you were stopped by the police officers nothing was said to them.
"I find it almost impossible to believe that someone consuming that amount of alcohol from any berry compote would not think 'there's something a bit funny about this'."
Mormon
Cook, who told the court they were a tee-total Mormon, said they had not touched alcohol since 1961 and was "shocked" when a breath test showed they were well over double the limit.
Cook claimed the only way the alcohol could have got into their system was from a litre and a half tub of raspberries they had eaten shortly before driving their private hire taxi.
The 69-year-old former Hibs player said the fruit - weighing a kilo and amounting to roughly 250 berries - must have contained alcohol they were unaware of at the time.
The 19-stone private hire driver, who is president and secretary of Newburgh Bowling Club, told Perth Sheriff Court they ate a huge amount of raspberries before bed every night as part of their ongoing battle against cancer.
Glasgow University toxicology expert Dr Robert Anderson told the court that the alcohol reading was equivalent to downing two bottles of white wine in around an hour.
Dr Anderson added that they would expect anyone who had not drunk for a long time to have been "significantly impaired" by consuming that amount of alcohol.
Cook said they had not noticed anything unusual about the raspberries when they were eating them and had gone out afterwards to drive a friend home in their own taxi.
After being arrested, Cook took a leftover raspberry for analysis and was told it contained 11.5 per cent alcohol.
The court was told that if they had eaten 1.5 litres it would have been equivalent to as much as ten pints of lager.
Cook admitted drink driving in Edinburgh road, Perth, on May 29 last year. They gave a breath reading of 83 mcg, compared to the 35 mcg limit.

Woman who performed a sex act upon a uniformed police officer wins £6,600 in damages from the Met for the psychological damage it had caused
PC James Formby was called to the home of an alleged ass ault victim
The woman then asked them to kiss them before performing a sex act on them
They later lost their job and was convicted of misconduct in a public office
They launched a lawsuit claiming the incident left them needing counselling
Judge awards them £6,600 in damages and criticises officer's judgment
They also slam the Metropolitan Police for fighting the case in court
A woman who performed a sex act on a uniformed police officer has won £6,600 in damages from the Metropolitan Police today.
The 37-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, asked PC James Formby, 34, to kiss them when they attended their home during a patrol in Bromley, south-east London.
But the woman brought a damages case claiming they had been too drunk to consent when they later performed a sex act on the officer, who is not married.
Former police constable James Formby lost their job after a woman performed a sex act on them after they were called to their house following reports they had been assaulted
The woman had been to a nightclub before their boyfriend allegedly attacked them in the street.
Formby and another officer attended their home in the early hours 19 September, 2009, and they stayed at the scene when the boyfriend was arrested.
The court heard this week how the woman 'asked Formby to kiss her' before 'removing their kit-belt and performing fellatio on him'.
The woman later insisted they had no memory of what happened until they 'woke up' during the sex act.
The court heard they later sent them a text message saying they wanted to 'do this again', but the woman reported the incident, leading to Formby facing a charge of misconduct in a public office and dismissal from the force.
After the ensuing damages claim came before the Central London County Court this week, Judge Edward Bailey today awarded a total of £6,600 in compensation to the woman for the psychological harm caused by the encounter.
Awarding the woman more than £6,000 in damages today, a judge said Formby (pictured) 'should have put judgment before desire'
The woman said they suffered from depression, the hair loss condition alopecia and underwent months of counselling after the incident.
The judge also blasted the Met Police Commissioner for fighting the case.
Giving their judgment today, Judge Bailey said: 'Both parties flirted but the claimant acted in a very sexualised manner.
'She was an active party in the initiation and commission of the oral sex. At no time did they pull away or ask the officer to desist.
'I conclude that there was consent to the sexual activity that took place.
The woman brought a lawsuit against the Met Police after Formby (pictured) admitted misconduct in a public office and was dismissed from the force
But they added: 'The more extreme and outrageous the claimant's conduct was the more the officer should have appreciated that here was a woman whose psychological state was such that sexual contact would cause harm.
'It is certainly not commonplace for a woman to throw themselves at a man they have just met. For a police officer on duty and in uniform every alarm bell in their head should have been ringing.
'But desire overcame judgement, it should have been the other way around.
' The officer didn't foresee the harm to the claimant but they did not stop to think that having sexual relations with this woman would cause their psychological damage.'
They added: 'I express my disappointment that the Commissioner contested these proceedings.
'This was a publicly-funded case and there can be no doubt that each side has incurred costs well in excess of any sum that any judge could possibly award for the events in question.
'There is no obvious financial reason for contesting the case.
'The defendant (Met Police) has forced the claimant to come to court stand in the witness box and recall, recount and be questioned on an episode of their life that they would dearly like to forget.
'She has had to do this for no obvious good reason.'
Formby, who gave evidence in the trial, maintained they had not taken advantage of the woman.
'She asked me to kiss them and I was a bit taken aback because I was a police officer on duty but on the other hand I'm a single guy,' they said.
'We ended up in the bedroom. ..She was on the bed, they had no bottom half on but was wearing a corset on the top half.
'We kissed, it was fairly frantic on their part and quite passionate. They were very clear physically about what they wanted to happen. '
The Metropolitan Police was criticised by the judge for fighting the damages claim and forcing the woman to take the stand
The woman, sitting with their publicly-funded legal team, wept during the hearing.
They told the court they were angry that Formby had not faced 'a more serious charge like rape'.
But their changing account of the night was severely criticised by the Met Commissioner's lawyer.
Jonathan Loades said the woman had presented 'a completely different version of events to that which was originally mentioned to the police'.
They had urged the court to reject a medical report on the woman's drunkeness, after the expert had failed to recognise the woman was 'a chronic depressive for a long time'.
Ruth Brander, for the woman, admitted their client had failed to rebuff the cop.
'It has never been the case the woman said 'no', but the issue is whether the witness had capacity to consent, given the state they were in.
'In terms of the misconduct offence I fully accept that what happened should not have happened.
'What I refuse to accept is that they were drunk or on drugs.'
In 2010, Formby, from Maidstone, Kent, was handed a 20 week prison sentence suspended for two years after they admitted misconduct in a public office.

More than 200 migrants are feared dead after five bodies were discovered off the Libyan coast, a Spanish aid organisation says.
Proactiva said the bodies were found floating near two capsized boats which could each hold more than 100 people.
The group's Laura Lanuza said the five they pulled from the Mediterranean were young men who appeared to have drowned.
A spokesperson for Italy's coast guard, which co-ordinates rescues, confirmed the five deaths.
The spokesperson told the BBC that the coast guard could not confirm whether any boats had sunk, and said no distress calls had been received.
Ms Lanuza said at least 240 migrants may have died as the boats were often overloaded by smugglers.
"We brought on board five corpses recovered from the sea, but no lives," the group wrote on its Facebook page.
"It is a harsh reality check of the suffering here that is invisible in Europe."
Numbers of migrants trying to reach Europe from Libya via Italy have risen dramatically this year since the route between Turkey and Greece was effectively shut down.
The Italian coast guard said they had co-ordinated more than 40 rescue operations in the last few days.
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says more than 20,000 migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year - and some 559 people are estimated to have died or gone missing en route.
This compares with fewer than 19,000 arrivals in Italy and about 350 deaths in the first three months of 2016.
"We have yet to complete March, and we are already racing at a pace of arrivals that has exceeded anything we've seen before in the Mediterranean," IOM spokesperson Joel Millman said earlier this week.
"This is typical of spring, getting very busy, but it's not typical to have the numbers be so high this early and the corresponding deaths that go with it."
The following statement appears in the December edition of San Francisco Medicine, the journal of the San Francisco Medical Society.
Time for New Perspectives
CANNABIS AND CALIFORNIA'S PHYSICIANS
Steve Heilig, George Fouras, Donald Abrams, and David Pating
There has long been a “drug war” surrounding marijuana, not only in terms of the plant's legal status but also in words. As the California Society of Addiction Medicine observes, “Reasonable dialogue regarding marijuana use has historically proven extraordinarily difficult.” The result is a longstanding stalemate and various symptoms of “reefer madness,” but with a growing consensus that our nation's marijuana policy has not served us much better than the failed experiment with alcohol prohibition many decades ago.
Most recently, there was this headline: “California Medical Association calls for legalization of marijuana.” It was a cover story in the Sunday Los Angeles Times in October. As the CMA is a large, mainstream medical society, this caused quite a stir.
The four authors of this article served as San Francisco's representatives on the CMA's “Technical Advisory Committee” (TAC) tasked with drafting “a comprehensive white paper recommending policy on marijuana legalization and appropriate regulation and taxation.” The TAC was “selected to represent CMA in the areas of science, ethical affairs, public health, addiction medicine, and expertise in the use of cannabis.” We met five times; the deliberations were sometimes contentious but each member agreed sufficiently to endorse a final report to the CMA board of trustees.
Our 14-page report, titled “Cannabis and the Regulatory Void”, was submitted to the CMA's Board of Trustees and approved, unanimously, in October. Reactions from all sides were immediate. The CMA was called “irresponsible” and at least one opponent utilized the cliché “What are they smoking?” But there has also been much positive response as well, with editorials saying we took “a bold step” towards “a prescription for the medical pot mess” and that that the CMA's “traditionally conservative doctors” are “simply acknowledging the obvious: Our current laws and the resulting war on drugs aren't working. “
1. Impact on Cannabis use: The primary concern regarding “legalization” or any lessening of legal penalties regarding cannabis is that it might increase use, particularly among teens. We share such concerns, especially in light of growing evidence regarding negative effects on neurodevelopment. But there is no good evidence that laws have much effect on use; in fact, long evidence is that our punitive approaches have little deterrent effect. Thus we should seek approaches which maximize knowledge about the impacts of cannabis use, and which do not worsen the problem by criminalizing otherwise law-abiding people, kicking kids out of schools to no productive end, wasting resources, and hampering research. Evidence-based drug education is difficult but likely to be at least as effective as legal approaches – and likely more so.
2. Resources and costs: Enforcing largely futile laws is expensive, especially when prison is involved. Appropriate treatment and education is far more cost-effective. While our report recommends an approach closer to that taken towards alcohol, at least for adults, we have no illusion that such an approach is easy or ideal, or that the taxation we endorse will be a simple matter or yield massive funding. But we are confident that it will be more cost-effective than longtime, failed “drug war” or prohibition-type policies. And very importantly, the funds saved and generated should be directed towards treatment of addiction.
3. Medical Marijuana: We join the many experts and organizations holding that cannabis be placed in a less restrictive category that would facilitate more research. And while we support some legal medical use of cannabis such as allowed since 1996 in California, we note that a decriminalization approach would have the salubrious effect of lessening or even eliminating the need for physicians to serve in the oft-uncomfortable “middle man” role of “gatekeeper” for medical use of cannabis – and also allow for more rigorous regulation of questionable practices at “cannabis dispensaries.”
An ever-growing roster of medical, legal, political, and other authorities of all political stripes feel that the time has come for a serious change in our drug laws, especially with respect to cannabis. We have joined them, as has the CMA.
Interestingly enough, another new CMA policy was independently adopted this year, which could have served as a preamble to our own report:
MEDICAL VS. LEGAL SOLUTIONS TO DRUG ABUSE: CMA encourages the federal government to re-examine the enforcement- based approach to illicit drug issues (“war on drugs”) and to prioritize and implement policies that treat drug abuse as a public health threat and drug addiction as a preventable and treatable disease.
We agree, and know that many others do as well. We hope our elected leaders will listen.

Stockholm Terrorist Was Illegal Alien – Denied Residence in 2014 But Stayed in Country
On Friday, an Islamic terrorist hijacked a truck and plowed over pedestrians in Stockholm, Sweden killing 4 and injuring over a dozen people.
SWEDEN TERROR ATTACK: Video showing moment Swede's running for their lives as truck plows through pedestrians. #StockholmAttack pic.twitter.com/3Uvy4oB0I0 — PeterSweden (@PeterSweden7) April 7, 2017
The terrorist is reportedly a 39 year old man from Uzbekistan who posted ISIS video to Facebook.
They were in the country illegally.
The Uzbek Islamist was denied residence in 2014 but stayed in the country for several years free from harassment.
Fria Tider reported (rough translation):
The 39-year-old Uzbek man arrested on suspicion of terrorist attack in Stockholm on Friday would be expelled from Sweden. The police said in a news conference on Sunday. Police also confirmed that they have shown sympathy with the Islamic state. The man applied for a residence permit in Sweden in 2014. In June 2016, they received the refusal and expulsion. But thanks to the generous regulatory framework, which allows expelled immigrants move in freedom in the country in anticipation of penalty is given, they could still remain in Sweden illegally. In December 2016 it was announced they will leave the country in February 2017 handed over execution decision to the police. On February 24, they were wanted by the police. Police also confirmed that the man has shown sympathies for Islamic terrorism.
Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) People are crowded into the streets around Caracas' Plaza Jose Marti. Smoke billows through the air and tear gas canisters hit the pavement. It has become a familiar scene in Caracas, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks against a government they believe is slowly becoming a dictatorship.
But today something is different.
The sound of a sole violin pierces the air. A young man, wearing a helmet painted with their country's flag, braces the instrument under their chin and confidently draws a bow over its strings.
The unidentified young man, who appears to be in their early 20s, is surrounded by protesters; one holds up a makeshift shield to protect him. Some protesters nearby throw Molotov cocktails at government forces. The musician doesn't seem to hear the chaos around him, just the music they create.
Iván Ernesto Reyes‏, a video journalist for Efecto Cocuyo, a Venezuelan independent media outlet, captured the moment on video.
When Reyes first heard the sounds of a violin, they thought the music was being played on speakers, they said. "We turned and looked, and saw this kid."
Reyes lost sight of the violinist in the crowd, only to spot them again about half an hour later.
"And there they are, standing, playing the Venezuelan anthem, and with a couple of kids that were around him, sort of protecting him," Reyes said.
They posted the footage of the musician on Twitter, saying "Today I witnessed a true example of magical realism. A protester played their violin while the (national guards) threw teargas and pellets."
"There were bombs, teargas and repression, but they kept playing their violin. They did not stop," Reyes said. "Too bad I wasn't able to speak with them because they were constantly playing."
Death of a violinist
Venezuela has been in a state of widespread unrest since March 29, when the Venezuelan Supreme Court dissolved parliament and transferred all legislative powers to itself. Doing away with the opposition-controlled legislative branch would have left the remaining two branches of Venezuelan government controlled by President Nicolas Maduro's ruling United Socialist Party. The opposition was outraged and called the move a coup.
Though the decision was reversed three days later, protests continued across the country, which is in the grip of severe food shortages and an economic crisis.
The protests have at times turned bloody, and 36 people have been killed, according to Venezuela's attorney general's office; more than 750 have been injured. Some deaths have been linked to opposition and pro-government protests, while others happened during acts of vandalism unrelated to the political unrest.
Only last week, a different violinist died in protests that turned violent. A bullet pierced 18-year-old Armando Cañizales' neck on Caracas' Francisco Fajardo highway.
Cañizales' friend Maru González remembered exchanging a few words with them in the chaos. "We told him, 'Let's go back,'" they said. "And they didn't want to. They told us, 'I will stay here, fighting for my country.'" Shortly afterward, Cañizales was dead.
Two days later, Venezuelan Vice President Tareck El Aissami said on state television that Cañizales got caught in the crossfire between violent protesters and national guards.
It was the "violent groups who shot and caused their death, whether it was deliberate or an accidental death," El Aissami said.
The teenager played the violin in Venezuela's popular youth music program, El Sistema. During Cañizales' funeral, fellow members of the program played the Venezuelan national anthem in their honor. It was a room full of young men and women, many tears in their eyes, the country's flag being held in the air. The room was filled with young men and women, many with tears in their eyes, holding the country's flag in the air.
Remains Of Hitler Deputy Rudolf Hess Cremated, Grave Destroyed
Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP
"The grave containing the remains of [Adolf] Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess has been destroyed to end it being used as a pilgrimage site by neo-Nazis," the BBC reports.
German's Der Spiegel writes that for years the grave site in the Bavarian town of Wunsiedel had been a gathering point for neo-Nazis who "celebrate Rudolf Hess as a martyr. It was also the object of shame among many locals."
So, it adds:
"The community removed the grave this week, daily Süddeutsche Zeitung reported Thursday. "With permission from members of Hess's family, workers exhumed the body and took down the headstone before dawn on Wednesday morning, the paper said. Their remains will now be cremated for a sea burial, in hopes of discouraging further interest by neo-Nazis. Their gravestone, which read 'Ich hab's gewagt,' or 'I have dared,' was taken down."
As the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum writes:

"Rudolf Hess (1894-1987) was a longstanding personal aide to Hitler, and deputy party leader of the Nazi party (until 1941). In May 1941, Hess flew to Scotland hoping to make peace between Germany and Britain. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned. Hess was found guilty on counts one (conspiracy) and two (crimes against peace) and sentenced to life imprisonment. Hess was the only one of the defendants to serve the full life term; they committed suicide in prison at age 93."
Update at 11:33 a.m. ET, July 22: A reader suggested that it would be more precise to say that the remains will be cremated, not "destroyed" as our headline originally read. We've made that change.

Once upon a time, the Forbes brand stood as one of the most highly regarded institutions in the world of media. Founded on September 15, 1917, the magazine built on the work of influential, well-respected contributors to become one of the most trusted names in business reporting. In 1996, the company expanded its presence to the web, founding Forbes.com as an online extension of its traditional reporting. The website has since grown to become one of the most visited financial websites on the internet, but all is not well for the media giant. Changing business models, plunging journalistic standards and intrusive advertising methods have rendered Forbes' website little more than a pale shadow of its former self – and caused potentially irreparable damage to its once-sterling reputation.
The Decline and Fall of Journalistic Integrity
Advertisements have, in some form or another, always been a part of media and journalism. Investigating leads, writing stories and publishing all require capital, and ad money is one reliable way to fill the gaps that subscriptions and other revenue streams don't cover. However, advertisements have traditionally been confined to discrete, relatively unobtrusive forms – banner ads, static images, sponsorships and so on – that clearly separate them from actual journalistic content.
Not so with Forbes' website, where advertisers are given a platform that is virtually equal to – and hardly distinguishable from – that given to journalists and the content they produce. This is no accident, and in fact, it represents a strategy laid out clearly by the company's Chief Product Officer, Lewis DVorkin, who said in a 2012 article published on the website: “Marketers are no longer satisfied with the 100-year-old silos that media professionals forced them into — containers intended to safeguard journalistic ‘truths' from mighty advertisers and to protect consumers from confusion, or themselves.” In other words, the venerable publisher no longer feels the need to protect the sanctity of journalism or erect barriers between ad content and editorial work.
This is perhaps best reflected in the company's “BrandVoice” product, which allows advertisers to produce their own editorial content that is then published alongside Forbes' own editorial pieces. Though the ads are labeled as such, the format is otherwise scarcely different from the stories produced by Forbes' contributing journalists. In effect, the company has chosen to cash in by selling its considerable brand equity – built largely on a formerly ironclad reputation and the steadfast work of talented journalists – to teams of marketers. Selling your integrity, as it turns out, is a pretty profitable venture – Forbes' bottom line has certainly benefited from these moves, even as the publisher's standing as a legitimate reporting outlet has come into question. When glorified PR pieces concocted by marketing executives are given virtually the same weight as hard-hitting investigative journalism, both readers and content creators lose.
The Content Mill
Equally troubling is the way in which Forbes.com generates its daily content. While the company still employs about 40 staff reporters to handle major news items, the website manages to churn out more than 400 new pieces a day thanks to a small army of more than 1,200 “contributors.” Many of these contributors are only paid based on the number of views their content generates, and even then, only recent content is valued. Writers receive just 25 percent of their normal pay for views on articles more than 90 days old; a business model that prioritizes large volumes of fresh new content above all else.
The result is a tremendous push to publish as many new articles as possible, as often as possible, regardless of the quality or utility of the content. This has led to a proliferation of the sort of pap previously relegated to the trash bins of the internet – clickbait titles, mindless listicles, entertainment and celebrity gossip, native advertising, self-serving press releases and faux outrage pieces. There is little to no editorial oversight, little accountability and no incentive to produce quality, independently verified content. Quantity over quality represents Forbes.com's rallying cry of late, and thousands of marketers, pundits, consultants and other non-journalists have taken up the flag.
This model serves no benefit except to improve Forbes' bottom line. Readers are served up unverified, biased or otherwise useless content from a broad network of self-serving writers. Contributors gain access to publishing under an increasingly tarnished brand in exchange for little to no pay and growing pressure to push out ever-greater volumes of empty content. Even advertisers may eventually feel the pinch as the publisher's once-sterling reputation continues its decline. Despite the improving bottom line, the plummeting journalistic standards – as well as a litany of user experience issues – may take a serious bite out of the site's traffic and general appeal.
Attack of the Ads
Speaking of user experience issues, Forbes' website is littered with clunky, obtrusive and occasionally even harmful interface features. Chief among This is the ever-present and almost universally loathed “Thought of the Day” – a bland, flat-gray interstitial ad that masquerades as a useful content page by proffering a banal daily quote. In reality, the landing page is simply another means of serving up ads and forcing readers to jump through hoops before they can access the content they're after.
This interloping advert is frustrating, obtrusive and unnecessary, but it's also a security threat. In 2015, Chinese hackers seized on vulnerabilities in the page's code to launch a serious attack on various U.S.-based institutions. Visitors from certain defense and financial institutions were redirected to another off-site page, where malware was surreptitiously distributed and loaded onto their devices. The exploits have since been patched, but the “Thought of the Day” ad model remains.
This isn't the only ad-related security threat, either. The website found itself embroiled in another controversy in 2016 when the publisher banned users from accessing the website while using ad-blocking software such as Adblock or uBlock. This alone resulted in a great deal of anger and frustration among readers, but the problem was compounded by the fact that some users, upon disabling their ad-blocking software as requested, were promptly served up malware along with their advertisements. Though Forbes' site is far from the only one to have been affected by such malicious advertising, it stands out for its efforts to prevent visitors from using the very software that might protect them against such threats.
The Audacity of Autoplay
As if all this weren't enough, Forbes.com has other ways to ruin their visitors' experience as well. Few things have aggravated would-be readers more than autoplay ads. These video ads are found scattered throughout the website, automatically playing once the page loads and often blasting unsuspecting visitors with high-volume advertisements. The ads are annoying at best, if not outright intrusive and disruptive. Even worse, the ads often fail to serve a purpose anyway. Most visitors seek to mute the ad immediately, and if they can't, they will instead close the page altogether.
This is compounded by awkward, unintuitive and poorly designed interfaces, often making it a chore simply to navigate the site. Both mobile and PC users are subjected to puzzling design choices and obnoxious ads, and some users have even experienced lagging and delays thanks to the site's overstuffed and poorly optimized format. For a website that depends so heavily on generating linkbacks and drawing in repeat visitors, this distasteful brew of incompetence and overt commercialism spells bad news.
Defending the Indefensible
Despite its many flaws, some have still come to Forbes' defense. The very nature of media is changing, supporters argue, and media companies must adapt or perish. This much is true, as the digital revolution has completely changed the media landscape and the growing power of advertisers has altered the balance of power. Many media companies have found themselves struggling to adjust to this new reality, and particularly those built in the halcyon days of print journalism.
Nonetheless, Forbes has opted to confront these challenges by taking the path of the least resistance. Rather than striving to leverage its journalistic power and build a reputation as a bastion of integrity in a sea of irrelevant drivel, the publisher has sold its integrity to the highest bidder, farmed out the majority of its work to unproven and unaccountable digital sharecroppers and deliberately sacrificed the experience of its readers in favor of greater ad revenue. The once-proud institution has largely been reduced to an ad-serving vehicle, with only enough quality content to justify its existence.
This is indefensible, and it's not clear there are any winners. Readers get continually declining quality, ads masquerading as journalism and content of increasingly questionable veracity. Contributors find themselves pressured into focusing on quantity over quality, with little to no reward for engaging in the challenging task of practicing proper journalism. Even the advertisers may soon see their golden goose collapse under the weight of its own avarice as visitors to the website are increasingly turned away by declining standards, distasteful ads and a poor user experience. In the end, Forbes' eagerness to embrace the modern media reality may prove to be its undoing.

Brazilian striker Robinho wants a move to Major League Soccer, and negotiations are underway to make it happen, AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani told media at a press conference on Friday.
Robinho has repeatedly been linked with 2015 MLS expansion club Orlando City in recent months, and Galliani gave the closest thing to official confirmation that has yet been made public. But the veteran Milan executive sounds uninclined to let them go at anything short of full value.
“Robinho wants to go to the American MLS,” Galliani said at an event introducing new Milan signings Michelangelo Albertazzi, Michael Agazzi, Jeremy Menez and Alex, which was transcribed and posted on the club's website. “The negotiations with Orlando have begun. They want Robinho, but we're not close to concluding the deal.”
Robinho is currently under contract with the Italian giants until June 2016, which would suggest that a transfer fee will be required to pry them loose from the Rossoneri.

Milan did consent to a mutual termination of Kaka's contract earlier this month, however, in order for the midfielder to join OCSC as the Lions' first-ever Designated Player.
For now at least, Galliani left no doubt about their willingness to play hardball on Robinho's case.
“The relationship with Robinho remains excellent, though, and it is just one of the many negotiations that are ongoing,” they noted.
What's at stake: Growth economist Paul Romer has caused a stir over the past few weeks in the blogosphere with a paper, first presented in January at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association and recently published, which argues that economic theory is becoming, more often than not, a sloppy mixture of words and symbols.

Justin Fox writes that once upon a time economists made their arguments in long, discursive, often contradictory books. To most modern economists these were the dark ages. In the 1940s Paul Samuelson brought enlightenment, in the form of elegant mathematical treatments of the major concepts in economics. Most of these ideas were inherently mathematical anyway, they argued in the introduction to their “Foundations of Economic Analysis,” first published in 1947, which meant that trying to express them in narrative form involved “mental gymnastics of a peculiarly depraved type.” Samuelson and others of their generation believed that mathematical reasoning would clarify economists' arguments. Romer claims we've reached the point where presenting a model is like doing a card trick. Tim Harford writes that if Romer is right, some economics papers are Orwellian Newspeak dressed up as calculus.
Paul Romer writes that like mathematical theory, mathiness uses a mixture of words and symbols, but instead of making tight links, it leaves ample room for slippage between statements in natural versus formal language. The market for mathematical theory can survive a few lemon articles filled with mathiness. But after readers have been disappointed too often by mathiness that wastes their time, they will stop taking seriously any paper that contains mathematical symbols. Economists have a collective stake in flushing mathiness out into the open. We will make faster scientific progress if we can continue to rely on the clarity and precision that math brings to our shared vocabulary.
The disconnect between language and math
Dietz Vollrath writes that one possible interpretation of mathiness is that it refers to “decorative math”. A paper may have a simple model, but there are all these adornments added (endogenous savings rates, endogenous labor supply decisions, heterogeneous agents, etc..) even though they have absolutely nothing to do with the simple model and change none of the conclusions. This decorative math actually makes the paper harder to understand, because now you have to keep track of all this additional notation. This is a frustrating feature of modern economics, but this “decorative math” is not what Romer had in mind. What Romer has in mind is the disconnect of the language from the math.
Paul Romer writes that mathiness is a critique of a style that lets economists draw invalid inferences from the assumptions and structure of a model; a style that authors can use to persuade the reader (and themselves) to adopt conclusions that do not follow by the rules of logic; a style that tolerates wishful thinking instead of precise, clearly articulated reasoning. The mathiness that I point to in the Lucas (2009) paper and in the follow-up paper by Lucas and Moll (2014) involves hand-waving and verbal evasion that is the exact opposite of the precision in reasoning and communication exemplified by Debreu/Bourbaki, and I'm for precision and clarity.
Chris House writes that mathematical sloppiness can be perfectly fine if it deals with a feature that is not a focus of the paper. Hand-waving of this sort likely comes at very little cost and may have benefits by eliminating a lengthy discussion of issues only tangentially related to the paper. On the other hand, if the hand-waving occurs when analyzing or discussing central features of the paper then I am much more inclined to ask the researcher to do the analysis right.
Mathiness and reality
Simon Wren-Lewis writes that Paul Romer's mathiness links to the idea by Paul Pfleiderer about theoretical models becoming “chameleons”. To quote: “A model becomes a chameleon when it is built on assumptions with dubious connections to the real world but nevertheless has conclusions that are uncritically (or not critically enough) applied to understanding our economy.” Dietz Vollrath writes that authors often play along by using very complicated math – “mathiness” – making their idea look more “science-ish”. They let people believe their model shows how the world does work, rather than how it might work.
Joshua Gans writes that for Romer mathiness is becoming more pervasive in economics. This is something worth testing, as anecdotal evidence does not necessarily mean that there is a pervasive problem. Noah Smith writes that in no other subject except mathematics itself will you see so many proofs and theorems. But the way math is used in (macro)economics isn't the same as in the hard sciences. In physics, if you write down an equation, you expect the variables to correspond to real things that you can measure and predict. If you read the macro literature, you see that almost every famous, respected paper is chock full of this sort of equations that don't match reality. Mathematical statements don't remotely correspond to observable reality, nor do they have any evidence in support of them. It's not just Lucas and Prescott, it's the whole scientific culture of the field.
Mathiness and academic politics
Paul Romer criticizes several papers by traditionalists that use mathiness to campaign for price-taking models of growth. For them, price-taking is dogma. Given the sharp limits imposed by the mathematics of their formal framework to explain endogenous growth, it is no surprise that traditionalists were attracted to the extra degrees of freedom that come from letting the words slip free of the math. The natural inference is that their use of mathiness signals a shift from science to academic politics, presumably because they were losing the scientific debate. If so, the paralysis and polarization in the theory of growth is not sign of a problem with science. It is the expected outcome in politics.

Call-out to #ShutDownCanada
from In Solidarity with All Land Defenders
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:
WHERE: Nationwide
WHEN: Friday, February 13th 2015
Grassroots collectives are organizing nationwide for a day of action to #ShutDownCanada. Through the use of a diversity of tactics the goal is to significantly impact the Canadian economy for one whole day.
What is the goal out of #ShutDownCanada?
To remove the veil or illusion of the Conservative government's “Action Plan” that is being touted as a strong economic stance for Canada in the global market. Economics being the key word and base of why there is such a blatant disregard for human rights and our environment. Bottom line is that the government is responsible for allowing multiple injustices including, but not limited to:
• The refusal to have adequate and meaningful investigation for missing and murdered indigenous women exemplifies Canada's systemic racism and permits it to continue.
• The ever increasing expansion of tar sands extraction and how this “development” is destroying a people (Dene), their way of life and the entire ecosystem needed for their survival. Not to mention the multitude of rare cancers and diseases which are byproducts of tar sands destruction.
• Pipeline construction which equals loss of jobs being exported topped with importing workers from other countries to take Canadian jobs (Action Plan) without the consent of First Nations.
• Issuing grants and licenses for open pit mining even after the Tshilqot'in Supreme Court decision, and the Mt Polley tailings pond breach without any real concerted effort in clean up.
• Fractured gas drilling and the serious intentional misleading of the truth of how this impacts our water supply.
• Site C dam construction and why it is being constructed, not to mention who it is displacing and how they never had any consent from First Nations to move forward.
• The destruction of wild salmon habitat, open net feedlots and fish farming with other countries in our waters destroying the seabed ecosystem and wild salmon stalks.
• Unconstitutional agreements such as FIPA, not to mention now even more so privacy laws are being changed without your consent which goes in direct violation of your actual charter of rights and freedoms.
While the issues are many and varied throughout different regions it's all interconnected and it is this corrupt government that is responsible. The only way for the people to get the attention of this government is to target their pocket books. That is the reason to #ShutDownCanada.
The system has failed us all miserably. There is no democracy and we the people have an obligation to demand justice for all. The current status quo in so-called Canada serves only the elite few while the majority of Canadians are financial slaves to the system. Politicians do not represent the people, nor have they ever. Indigenous communities know this all too well and have been actively resisting subjugation since contact with the first colonizers who illegally imposed their jurisdiction through covert biological warfare and the ongoing genocide implemented with the residential school system.
The residential schools took the children from the land to disconnect people from their culture in order to take the land from the children. The genocide is ongoing, we still see the constant removal of indigenous children from their ancestral lineages and the untimely deaths of so many indigenous men, women and children. Indigenous peoples are over-represented in the (in)justice system and homeless populations are disproportionately indigenous. The systemic racism in the RCMP and Police forces negates any effective justice from taking place. This is the reason why so many indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered without any real action to prevent further violence.
Everything is interconnected. This government blatantly oppresses indigenous peoples in a calculated effort to create dysfunction within communities to maintain control of the land and exploitation of natural resources. The rape and destruction of our mother earth is another facet of the ongoing genocide which holds no prejudice affecting all children of the earth. We are all directly affected by ecocide.
Make no mistake that systemic racism and structural violence are connected to the needs of this illegal colonial state to maintain control of the land for exploitation. That is why we must call attention to these issues at the same time – the tars sands, the pipelines, fracking, mining, mega-dam projects and justice for #MMIW — it's all connected.
CALLOUT for communities across Canada to blockade their local railway, port or highway on February 13th. Don't buy, don't fly, no work and keep the kids home from school. A diversity of tactics is highly recommended! Get everyone involved. The goal is to significantly impact the Canadian economy for a day and demand there be an independent inquiry into the 2000+ cases of missing or murdered indigenous women. It's Time to #ShutDownCanada.

Call it a warning shot: last week an Indian patent court shocked the $600 billion global pharmaceutical business by ordering Bayer, the German health care giant, to allow a tiny Indian generic drug company to sell cheap copies of the blockbuster cancer drug Nexavar – even though everyone agrees that the drug is protected by a patent. Instead, the court decided that Bayer had an obligation to make Nexavar available to people in India who needed it.
The Indian decision is “arbitrary,” says Sapna Palla, a lawyer at Kaye Scholer who represents pharmaceutical firms in patent litigation. Why Nexavar, and not any other high-priced drug? They say it “undermines the innovative pharmaceutical industry in India in the long run” and predicts the decision will “stymie foreign investment in India” because it will add to doubts about the Indian patent system. (Bayer contests the decision, too.)
It's a basic tenet of the pharmaceutical business that companies have a right to charge high prices for new, innovative medicines. Because more than 90% of experimental drugs fail to be proven safe or effective, it's necessary for medicines to generate billions of dollars in sales in order to entice investors and companies to sink money into research. Patent protection is not the ideal way to fund medical research, but nobody has found anything better.
But in this case, the Indian patent court and Natco Pharmaceuticals, which brought the case, have a point. The many thousands of Indian patients suffering from kidney or liver cancer could not get their hands on Nexavar. Only a few percent of them took it.
Knowledge Ecology International, a group that campaigns for people in developing world to have better access to new medicines, says Nexavar was priced at $69,000 for a year of treatment, 41 times the per capita income in India. For comparison, a drug that cost 41 times the U.S. per capita income would cost $1.6 million. The Natco price? $177.
In the U.S., Nexavar actually costs even more in real dollars. The average liver cancer patient would pay $80,000 for a ten-month course if they were paying the wholesale acquisition cost of Nexavar; kidney cancer patients pay $96,000 a year. Except, of course, that they don't pay. Insurers cover much of the cost. Bayer and partner Onyx Pharmaceutical, which split sales duties in the U.S., have a program to make sure that eligible patients aren't responsible for more than $100 of copayment. They also have programs to make sure that uninsured patients have access to the drug.
Even for mass-market drugs, it is increasingly the reality in the U.S. that the patient doesn't pay. Insured patients can get $160 worth of branded Lipitor for $4, with maker Pfizer picking up the rest of the co-payment. Meanwhile, Pfizer is negotiating with health plans to convince them to buy its Lipitor over the $120-a-month generic version.
This is even more true for the specialty medicines, like cancer drugs, that are the drug industry's stock-in-trade these days. The customer is not the patient but the insurance company or government picking up the check. That's why drug companies refer to governments and insurers as “the payors.”
As a result drug companies can price new medicines at a cost that no individual person could pay. I count ten medicines that have an average per patient cost of more than $200,000 per patient per year, including the treatments made by Sanofi's Genzyme unit, Biomarin, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, and now Vertex's new cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco -- the first medicine ever to work on the genetic defect that causes that lung disease, but only for a select few that have a particular mutation.
It's an open question, but it's possible that it's better to have $300,000 drugs that are highly effective than $3,000 drugs that aren't . All these medicines are priced as they are because the Payors will pay. Alexion, whose Soliris treats rare and lethal disorders that destroy blood cells or damage the kidneys. "Even at a $400,000+ per year price point, they manage to justify the value of their medicine for the small patient populations with the relevant diseases," writes Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. Proof? Alexion's stock has been outperforming Apple's. That will get a lot more companies interested in rare diseases. We're still not at $1.6 million per patient per year, the per capita equivalent of Bayer's price in India, but there is no reason to think we can't get there.
But moving these drugs into other countries often means giving even more away. One executive once told me their emerging markets strategy for these ultra-rare disease drugs was to get any patient who needed the medicine on it, and then to try to convince governments or insurers to pay full price for one patient, then another, then another. The key is that the medicines be worth the money.
Even at Nexavar's comparatively low price point of "just" $80,000 a year, this same strategy can work. Assuming Bayer can make Nexavar for about the same price as Natco, it could break even getting paid for one out of four hundred prescriptions. It needs to do better than that, financially, but it also needs to find ways to make the drug available to patients who need it worldwide. The new pharma compact may well be that companies can charge what they will, but that they must in the meantime make sure patients get their medicines. How long this system will be sustainable is, of course, anybody's guess.
The film Two Spirits is a sad but empowering film about a hate crime committed against Freddie Martinez, a Two-Spirited transgendered Navajo youth in Colorado. 16-year-old Freddie was brutally killed by being repeatedly hit in the head with a large rock. Unlike the Matthew Shepherd case in Oct. of 1998, the Freddy Martinez case got little media attention. The film, and the visibility, was inspired in part by a renewed awareness of Two-Spirit traditions.
The film, in addition to details about their life and death, also contains interviews of Two-Spirit persons and tells the history of how, prior to colonial times in the land that we now know as the United States of America, LGBT people were respected, and at times even honored or feared, for their powers as Two Spirits.
The Two Spirits were considered the ceremonial leaders, the healers and sacred people of many tribes. They acquired names and clothing that identified accepted, even if liminal, gender identities. They were known as winkte by the Lakota, as lhamana by the Zuni, or as nadleehe of the Navajo nation, and by many others names. In order to coin an English word that approximates to the many terms used in the Native languages, in 1990 at the 3rd Annual First Nations Gay and Lesbian American Conference, which was held in Winnipeg, Canada, LGBT Native Americans decided on using Two-Spirits as the pan-tribal English term for their tradition.
Prior to this, anthropologists had labeled the phenomenon as berdache, but this term was linked to a history of human trafficking and of kept-boys and many considered the term an insult. Two-Spirits, in aboriginal tradition, were weavers, storytellers, caretakers of the orphans, healers, ritual leaders. A male-to-female Two-Spirit known as Wewha, who was beloved by their people, had been an ambassador of their people to the District of Columbia at one point and was quite respected by the politicians of their day (many of whom probably didn't suspect they were a biological male).
In Mexico, some of the conquistadors hated the Two-Spirits so much that they fed them to wild dogs according to one chronicle, but then in modern-day Oaxaca, Mexico today a similar tradition to Two-Spirits known as muxhes flourishes. Its region of Juchitan, known for its muxhes tradition, happens to be one of the regions with the highest proportions of indigenous in the country. Many nations used to entrust their Two-Spirits with keeping spiritual folklore, which leads one to suspect that the systematic killing of the Two-Spirits (which was documented both in Mexico and the US), like the near-extinction of the buffalo, also had the effect of dismantling the lore, the ritual cycle, and the cosmovision of the aboriginals.
In the documentary, some of the Native leaders mention in passing that Two-Spirits also married people of the same gender. At times, a female chief would live their life as a male warrior, even taking on their own wife. Or a male chief would have multiple wives, and among them count a male-to-female wife.
It's an irony of history that this had not been woven into our demoralizing and dishonest national narrative about gay marriage: so invisible are Native Americans, and so trivialized their culture, dismissed as if it wasn't part of our heritage, that the Christian Right's assertion, almost mantra, that “marriage has always been between a man and a woman” has never been challenged in a significantly public manner by someone with just a basic knowledge of Native American history.
Illinois has finally assumed a place in modernity by becoming one of the states where gay marriage is legal. But one should not forget that we are returning rights that were enjoyed for centuries before the arrival of Europeans. Traditions of same-sex marriage had been practiced for centuries and were as American as any other American tradition.
History gets told by the conqueror but let's get history straight, for once. Marriage was not always between a man and a woman. It was oftentimes between a man and many wives, in parts of Africa between a woman and many men, and in our continent it was often between two people of the same gender. Monogamy (both opposite-sex and same-sex) was a late-comer. But these were all marriage traditions, and they've always changed to reflect societal attitudes towards gender.

Here's what you need to know...
Pyramids involve picking a number of reps and working down from there on each subsequent set. There are different pyramids with different rep ranges for strength, generalized hypertrophy, and bodybuilding combos or supersets.
At my gym, we do a variety of what we call "pyramids" for fat loss, strength, and hypertrophy. Pyramids are very simple and effective, and when you combine exercises – bench, squat, and deadlift – they become even more effective.
What's a Pyramid?
A pyramid is super simple. You take an exercise, pick a start number of reps, and begin your pyramid. Let's use squats as an example.
Do 10 reps
Rest
Do 9 reps
Rest
Do 8 reps
Repeat this pattern until you hit your final pyramid number, which could be 8 reps, 5 reps, or 1 rep, depending on whether you're doing pyramids for fat loss, strength, or hypertrophy.
Pyramid Benefits
You use the same weight for all your sets.
As you fatigue, the number of reps lower.
Mentally it's easy to focus and maintain motivation as your rep numbers get lower with each set.
Pyramids can be used for conditioning, fat loss, strength, or hypertrophy.
There are unlimited combinations of exercises, rep schemes, and rest protocols.
Strength Pyramids
When it comes to building strength, the magic number for me and a lot of lifters has always been 5 reps. Anything more than 5 is too many, and doing singles over time isn't a good thing because it leads to CNS fatigue, injuries, and overall wear and tear on the body. As such, when I'm doing pyramids for strength, my starting number is 5 reps.
So let's say we're doing deadlifts and the starting weight is 465 pounds.
Do 5 reps at 465 pounds.
Rest between 2 and 5 minutes.
Do 4 reps at 465 pounds.
Rest between 2 and 5 minutes.
Do 3 reps at 465 pounds.
Continue in this manner until you finish up with 465 for 1 rep. The following week, increase the weight by 5 to 10 pounds and repeat the strength pyramid.
You end up doing 15 reps overall using the same weight. You're doing the same work as you would with 3 sets of 5 or 5 sets of 3, but the great thing is that every rep is high quality. You stay focused and you keep the bar moving fast and true because you use fewer reps with each set. As a competitive powerlifter, pyramids are perfect for me as I get in 5 sets of every lift, but I'm also working in all rep ranges from 5 right down to a tight 1-rep max at the end.
Here's a sample strength pyramid workout for powerlifting:
Day 1
A. Back Squat
Set 1: 5 Reps
Set 2: 4 Reps
Set 3: 3 Reps
Set 4: 2 Reps
Set 5: 1 Reps
B. Bench Press
Set 1: 5 Reps
Set 2: 4 Reps
Set 3: 3 Reps
Set 4: 2 Reps
Set 5: 1 Reps
C. Deadlift
Set 1: 5 Reps
Set 2: 4 Reps
Set 3: 3 Reps
Set 4: 2 Reps
Set 5: 1 Reps
Add 5 pounds to the bar the following week. Do this for 4-6 weeks and then change your program.
Basic Hypertrophy Pyramid
The magic number for building muscle falls between 5-12 reps. Of course, with squats the magic number can be 20 or more, but for now let's stick with the conventional hypertrophy rep-range which is generally 8-12. As such, you'd begin the pyramid with 12 reps and finish with 8.
So let's say we're doing bench presses and the starting weight is 350 pounds.
Do 12 reps at 250 pounds.
Rest about a minute.
Do 11 reps at 250 pounds.
Rest about a minute.
Do 10 reps at 250 pounds.
Continue in this manner until you finish up with 250 for 8 reps.
The following week, increase the weight by 5 to 10 pounds and repeat the basic hypertrophy pyramid. You'd be doing 5 sets for a total of 50 reps.
Bodybuilding Hypertrophy Pyramid
When it comes to building muscle, I find it best to train opposing muscle groups together. Chest and back is a great combo, as are biceps and triceps and hamstrings and quads. This is nothing new when it comes to bodybuilding. However, when you combine a pyramid into training opposing muscle groups, things get to be a lot more fun and the benefits are amazing for blood flow, pump, recovery, and of course, building muscle.
Let's look at training chest and back together and we'll use bench presses and bent-over rows as examples. Your first set on bench press is 12 reps. You rest for 1 minute and your next set is 12 reps on bent-over rows. Rest another minute and do 11 reps of bench presses. Rest again and do 11 reps on bent-over rows. Continue super-setting in this manner until you finish sets of 8 on both exercises.
Pairing opposing muscle groups like this will allow for more recovery between sets and give you a pump that's beyond intense. Do this with your training partner in a "you go, I go" workout and things can get crazy. Here's how you might program a week of bodybuilding hypertrophy pyramids:
Day 1 Chest & Back
Exercise Reps Rest A1 Bench Press 12 working down to 8 1 min. A2 Bent-Over Row 12 working down to 8 1 min. B1 Incline Dumbbell Press 12 working down to 8 1 min. B2 Seated Row 12 working down to 8 1 min. C Push-Up 15 working down to 1 1 min.
Day 2 Off

Day 6 Off
Day 7 Glutes & Core
Exercise Reps Rest A1 Hip Thruster 15 working down to 5 1 min. A2 Ab Roll Out 15 working down to 5 1 min. B1 Single Leg Hip Thruster 15 working down to 5 1 min. B2 Knee Up 15 working down to 5 1 min.

They said 240,000 student visas were issued in the 2008-9 statistical year, accounting for a third of all migrants reaching Britain.

The rapid rise in immigration , and the strain it has imposed on public services like education, medical care and the welfare system, promise to be a major issue in a general election that must be held before June. The ruling Labour Party has come under growing pressure from the opposition parties — in particular the Conservatives, who are leading in pre-election polls — to defend policies that have brought three million migrants to the country since the party took power in 1997.
Still, the Christmas Day attack appeared to have had an influence. Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said that Britain regarded the thwarted attack as “a wake-up call” requiring a review of airport security measures and border controls, among other things. And British officials were at pains to explain a sequence of events that led Mr. Abdulmutallab to be denied a student visa to re-enter Britain in May 2009, but not flagged to the United States as a potential security risk.
They have said that the Nigerian was rejected because they had applied to study at a “bogus college” not on a visa-approval list, not because of their radical links, and that monitoring of their activities as a student at University College London from 2005 to 2008 showed them to be a “peripheral figure” among Islamic radicals, and not at the time a terrorist threat. Still, the attempt heightened American concerns about efforts by terrorists to gain entry to Britain through what critics had often described as the “gaping holes” in the student visa system.

Home Secretary Alan Johnson, responsible for overseeing domestic security, said in a BBC interview that care would be taken not to damage “a major part of the U.K. economy,” the $8 billion to $13 billion a year generated by the education of foreign students here. But in a formal statement, Mr. Johnson said that “those who are not seriously interested in coming here to study, but come primarily to work, should be in no doubt that we will come down hard on those that flout the rules.”
The restrictions will include a requirement that students speak English well enough to pass British high school exams, not just the “beginner's English” required previously. Applicants for courses lasting less than six months will no longer be allowed to bring family members with them, and the dependents of students on courses not leading to degrees will be barred from working. Colleges will be more tightly monitored, to eliminate the kind of fake institutions that one critic described last year as “a couple of people above a chip shop.”
The restrictions come only nine months after a major overhaul aimed at weeding out false applicants. But the new system — requiring applicants to show they have offers from approved colleges and adequate finances — was quickly overwhelmed, particularly in the Indian subcontinent, where applications soared and British officials complained that they were approving applications on paperwork alone, with no interviews.
SALT LAKE CITY — Utah is the most charitable state in the country, thanks in part to generous members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, according to a new report.
A report by finance website WalletHub featured on USA Today ranked Utah first for the "highest percentage of donated income and highest percentage of population who donate time," and specifically pointed to Utah's high Mormon population.

The WalletHub report defined "charitable" as "volunteering and service," as well as "charitable giving." It also considered community service requirements for high school graduation and public charities per capita.
Utah was followed by Maryland, Minnesota, Wyoming and Wisconsin in the top five most charitable states.
Hawaii was named the least charitable state, accompanied by Rhode Island, Nevada, Louisiana, Arizona and Texas.

A week in SE Asia with the Prime Minister and UKTI
Rolls-Royce. Airbus. Lloyds of London… Blockchain. Wait, what?
It started with an unusual email from a government official asking for a call. Strange emails are more or less par for the course for the CEO of a bitcoin company, but a few minutes into the call, I realized something groundbreaking was happening. For the first time, a bitcoin company was being invited on an official tour with the leader of a nation.****Not just any leader, mind you, but the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, home to London – the seat of global financial power.
The official voice on the other end of the receiver was inviting me to join a delegation of executives from a who's-who of top-tier UK companies (including Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Lloyds of London, and Arup among others) traveling to Southeast Asia with the PM.
As announced by the Prime Ministers office, and covered by the press, the Prime Minister invited Blockchain as part of their commitment to ensure the UK remains a leading global fintech hub.
From July 26th to July 30th we visited Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. I spoke to senior regulators, bank CEOs, telecommunications executives and other leaders about the future we are working towards as an industry – an open financial platform in which anyone can participate.
I came away with a few impressions:
The economy of Southeast Asia is growing rapidly, but the financial services that should support that growth are weak
Indonesia alone is projected to move from the world's 16th largest economy to the 7th largest by 2030. Despite rapid economic growth and tens of millions of consumers entering a consumer class, only 20-30 million Indonesians out of 250 million have a credit or debit card. Of those, fully 70% are under 35 years old.
The overall outlook is remarkably similar throughout SE Asia and is characterized by rapidly growing economies that are going increasingly digital, with high smartphone penetration amongst predominantly under 35 populaces.
In broad terms, heavy financial infrastructure, i.e. large corporate finance, investment banking, and private equity funds are relatively well-developed in the region. Consumer and SME level access to stable, trusted digital financial tools capable of transferring value within the region is less advanced and is perhaps a key market opportunity for fintech companies in London.
Much of the world still knows very little about the Bitcoin Protocol
It is incredibly easy to become immersed in one's own environment. In my world, it sometimes feels as if nearly everyone knows what bitcoin is, how it works, and that it will change the world.
We've come a long way in spreading the word over the last four years, but we are nowhere close to being done. Almost everyone I spoke to in SE Asia either had only the vaguest idea, or had barely heard of bitcoin. Interestingly, the few exceptions were regulators and bankers in Singapore.
State Dinners do not last long
If you are like me, you assume an official State Dinner would last several hours – especially if you saw the five to seven-course menus. Wrong – the longest was just 5 blocks (52 minutes) and the shortest was just 3 blocks (37 minutes). High speed dining indeed.

*The UK is serious about being the global leader in our space*
The UK has long taken a pragmatic regulatory approach to bitcoin and fintech (as seen, for example, in thoughtfully allowing P2P lending framework to mature from within the industry itself). In the current global regulatory environment, it isn't easy to take this road less traveled, but the UK, led by David Cameron has done precisely that. The UK approach is to lead, to encourage fintech in Britain, and to carefully weigh the advantages, risks and potential policy implications related to the Bitcoin protocol.
It was an honor to speak with the Prime Minister about bitcoin and Blockchain's leadership role – doubly so because it happened at such a critical moment in our industry. The convergence of fintech, bitcoin, and global opportunity were affirmed when Mr. Cameron even made reference to their understanding of the technology in official remarks.
Looking back, it was the quiet moments that mattered the most: speaking with cabinet members in a conference room, exchanging drafts with staff on a plane to Jakarta, and hearing the news (before it became news) from the members of the traveling press. These were the invaluable insights that made the trip worthwhile.

The newspaper, one of the most widely circulated in the country, published a scathing critique of the Republican nominee on Thursday, arguing that no presidential contest until now has warranted such a statement.
“This year, the choice isn't between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences,” reads the editorial. “This year, one of the candidates — Republican nominee Donald Trump — is, by unanimous consensus of the Editorial Board, unfit for the presidency.”
The editorial continues: “From the day they declared their candidacy 15 months ago through this week's first presidential debate, Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that they lack the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.”
The editorial lists reasons to vote against Trump, including their prejudiced rhetoric, their erratic temperament, their “checkered” business history and their dishonesty.
The paper stopped short of endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
“Stay true to your convictions,” the board urged readers. “That might mean a vote for Clinton, the most plausible alternative to keep Trump out of the White House. Or it might mean a third-party candidate. Or a write-in. Or a focus on down-ballot candidates who will serve the nation honestly, try to heal its divisions, and work to solve its problems.
“Whatever you do, however, resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue,” concludes the editorial. “By all means vote, just not for Donald Trump.”
USA Today's editorial adds to a string of high-profile, anti-Trump statements by newspapers, including right-leaning publications.
While the influence of newspaper endorsements has declined along with readership, surprising statements still have an impact. While the influence of newspaper endorsements has declined along with readership, surprising statements still have an impact.

A mosque in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) capital, has been renamed “Mary, Mother of Jesus”.
Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi crown prince and deputy supreme commander of the UAE armed forces, ordered that the mosque be renamed to “consolidate bonds of humanity between followers of different religions.”
Mary plays a prominent role in the Christian and Islamic traditions.
Reverend Canon Andrew Thompson of St. Andrew's Church, an Anglican parish near the newly renamed mosque, expressed is gratitude in an interview with Gulf News.
“We are delighted that we are celebrating something that we have in common between both our faiths,” they said.
Rev Thompson also said that Mary “symbolises obedience to God” in both faiths, and that they looked forward to “growing in deeper understanding” with members of the Islamic faith.
The move to rename the mosque – which was formerly known as the Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Mosque – reflects the UAE's efforts to appear as champions religious tolerance in the region.
Although the UAE's official religion is Islam, the nation's constitution includes a clause guaranteeing the freedom to practice any religion. The International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland also ranked the UAE first regionally and third globally for religious tolerance.
In 2015, the Roman Catholic Church in Abu Dhabi opened its second church, according to the State Department of the United States. The UAE also granted land to construct the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi.
Jeramie Rinne, senior pastor of the Evangelical Community Church in Abu Dhabi, said in an interview with The Cable that the mosque's renaming indicates the importance of the UAE's stance on religious tolerance.
“The UAE continues to set the pace in this region for peaceful coexistence and cooperation,” they said. “We are very encouraged and feel blessed to be a part of this nation.”
GEELONG wants to play a home final at Simonds Stadium if it qualifies for one, but understands it will only happen if the Cats meet an opponent that does not draw a large crowd in Victoria.
Although plenty could change with 13 rounds remaining, third-placed Greater Western Sydney would meet the second placed Cats' in a qualifying final if finals were played this week.
Despite a reduced capacity of around 30,000 due to the ongoing stadium upgrade, Cats CEO Brian Cook told K-Rock on Saturday the club would be interested in hosting clubs such as the Giants at Simonds Stadium in a final if the opportunity arose.
"I think the principle has to remain and has to be consistent throughout Australia and if we do play a GWS or a lower drawing capacity team and it is our right to host that game I think we should be playing it at Simonds," Cook said.
Cook said the Cats understands it's unlikely they would play a final at Simonds Stadium if they qualified to play Collingwood or Hawthorn given its limited capacity compared to the MCG or Etihad Stadium.
Finals against the Sydney Swans, Adelaide or West Coast would also be unlikely to be played at Simonds Stadium as they traditionally attract a large number of supporters to finals in Victoria.
In early May, AFL CEO Gill McLachlan said on Fox Footy that the Giants would play a home final at Spotless Stadium if they earned the right rather than ANZ Stadium or the SCG.
"It would be at Spotless … that's their home ground, and if the Gold Coast Suns got a home final it would be at Metricon," McLachlan said.
Despite McLachlan's comments, the AFL is not likely to discuss potential finals match-ups and venues until later in the year because so much of the season remains to be played out.
The Giants are in superb form and looked headed for their first finals campaign after six wins on the trot, but have only averaged 10,562 spectators at their three home games so far.
GWS CEO David Matthews expressed confidence on Sunday that the club could attract at least 20,000 spectators to a home final and thinks the average crowd figure at the venue will grow as the season unfolds.
"In three weeks' time we will sell the game out against the Swans, when we get Collingwood here I think we will go close to a sell-out. We've had 16-17,000 come and watch Hawthorn (the crowd was 13,766)," Matthews told 3AW.
"If we did find ourselves in that position there are two or three months worth of momentum in building the crowd. I think we could be confident of a big crowd [if we hosted a final]."
Geelong lost the only final it hosted at Simonds Stadium, going down to Fremantle in the 2013 Qualifying Final by 15 points in front of 32,458 spectators.
Making its way around the internet is a news piece in Nature covering the latest “blowback” to social psychology due to replication failure. The researchers attempted to replicate a series of experiments purporting to show “intelligence priming” i.e. merely thinking about a professor as opposed to a thug will make you perform better on some task. Studies like these are of course a dime a dozen in social psychology circles e.g. reading words associated with oldness like “Florida” make you walk slower, or finding a dime in phone booth increases your odds of donating to a charity. Such findings inspired hordes of experimentalists to try and produce similar results, and by and large they have succeeded in doing so across a variety of domains. Of course, these kinds of effects are typically small, sometimes measured in minute difference in reaction times.
Taken as a whole, the literature seems convincing. But take each study individually and skepticism rears its head about task validity, sample sizes, weak effects, and of course replication. This skepticism has been building to point that journalists and science writers now entertain words like “crisis” to describe the scientific respectability of social psychology, especially after the recent series of high-profile fraud by leaders of the field. Reflecting broader intellectual moods, the author of the Nature piece then says this:
The theory holds that behaviour can be influenced, or ‘primed', by thoughts or motives triggered unconsciously — in the case of intelligence priming, by the stereotype of a clever professor or a stupid hooligan. Most psychologists accept that such priming can occur consciously, but many, including Shanks, are unconvinced by claims of unconscious effects.
Notice how the last line is “unconscious effects” in general not “these particular unconscious effects of intelligence priming”. Whether or not this is Shanks view or simple journalistic distortion, the author implies that there is a heated empirical controversy about the actual existence of “genuine” unconscious activity, and that it's still an open question whether there the unconscious “has effects” at all. Although I do not specifically endorse the recent (2006) version of “unconscious-thought theory” proposed by Dijksterhuis (imo, a classic case of reinventing the wheel), in this post I want to convince you that there is no empirical controversy at all about the existence of unconscious effects in general, and that the great causal efficacy and intelligence of the unconscious mind should understand as a theoretical axiom to be taken for granted, not a hypothesis in need of empirical “proof”.
Obviously any scientific theory must be stated in terms that are meaningful, otherwise we cannot make sense of what the theory claims to be true about the world. Accordingly, a theory that calls itself the “unconscious thought theory” should provide an operational definition of “conscious” because the claim is meant to be contrastive: whatever consciousness is, thoughts can happen without it. Thus, to understand the unconscious thought theory we must have a sense of what it means to be conscious. (We need to also have an operational definition of “thought”, but I will set this aside).
As theoreticians, we have unlimited freedom in defining the specialized theoretical terms we use in our theories so long as we can convince our colleagues that these are coherent and useful. Suppose you defined consciousness to be synonymous with what is understood to be uniquely human, reflective, introspective consciousness, what theorists sometimes call “System II processing” or what laypersons might think of as “self-consciousness”. If this is how the term consciousness is defined, then it follows axiomatically that all (or most) nonhuman animals are “unconscious”, or as I like to say, “nonconscious”. And clearly nonconscious animal minds are capable of producing a continual stream of intelligent and brilliantly adaptive behaviors. Thus, it is clearly unnecessary to go into a social psych lab to “prove” that the unconscious “has effects”. We plainly see the varied effects of the unconscious in nonhuman animal behavior all around us.
When psychologists throw around terms like “unconscious” they often fail to unambiguously specify the precise operational meaning of the contrasting term “conscious”. As a result, the folk psychological associations of the term as synonymous with “incoming sensory awareness” makes it sounds so cruel and mean to deny nonhuman animals consciousness. Upon reading the above paragraph, many people would immediately say how ghastly it is to deny animals experience, sentience, or a mental life. But it would be an anthropocentric delusion to suppose that human reflection alone bestows mentality upon an otherwise mindless nonconscious system. It is quite the reverse, in fact. It is the buzzing humming activity of the nonconscious system that bestows meaning and mindfulness upon the conscious system. Clearly, if you are an animal and lack reflective consciousness you are not thereby deprived of experience. I am doubtful that the terms “experience” or “awareness” can be given operational precision, but pretheoretically it is quite plain what it means to say that an animal is aware but unreflective; they can process information on-the-fly to produce intelligent, adaptive behavior but cannot “step back” and engage in sophisticated reflection.
In conclusion, I hope to have shown that the unconscious-thought theory is not a hypothesis that can be empirically proved or disproved. When a lab fails to produce priming effects, this has zero bearing on the claim that most of our mental activity is unconscious. That idea falls out of the definition of consciousness as the rarified act of reflective consciousness. It is a theoretical axiom, a guideline for hypothesis generation and research.

Security Report: Massive Cyberattack In Progress In the USA, Europe, Latin America: $2.5 Billion Siphoned From Financial Institutions So Far
June 26th, 2012
SHTFplan.com
Read by 16,776 people Mac SlavoJune 26th, 2012 Leading cybersecurity firm McAfee has issued a startling breaking news report that indicates the U.S., European and Latin American financial systems are under a massive financial attack that have digitally siphoned some $2.5 billion from thousands of accounts from various financial institutions. According to McAfee, the attacks are ongoing and international law enforcement agencies are currently working to shut them down: McAfee and Guardian Analytics have uncovered a highly sophisticated, global financial services fraud campaign that has reached the American banking system. As this research study goes to press, we are working actively with international law enforcement organizations to shut down these attacks. Unlike standard SpyEye and Zeus attacks that typically feature live (manual) interventions, we have discovered at least a dozen groups now using server-side components and heavy automation. The fraudsters' objective in these attacks is to siphon large amounts from high balance accounts, hence
the name chosen for this research: Operation High Roller. With no human participation required, each attack moves quickly and scales neatly. This operation combines an insider level of understanding of banking transaction systems with both custom and off the shelf malicious code and appears to be worthy of the term “organized crime.” This study found 60 servers processing thousands of attempted thefts from high-value commercial accounts and some high net worth individuals. As the attack shifted emphasis from consumers to businesses, mule business accounts allowed attempted transfers averaging in the thousands of Euros, with some transfers as high as €100,000 (US$130,000). Three distinct attack strategies have emerged as the targets have expanded from the European Union, to Latin America, to the United States. Debunking the popular wisdom that only big banks are affected, the research documents attacks at every class of financial institution: credit union, large global bank, and regional bank. So far, we estimate the criminals have attempted at least €60 million (US$78 million) in fraudulent transfers from accounts at 60 or more financial institutions (FIs). If all of the attempted fraud campaigns were as successful as the Netherlands example we describe in this report, the total attempted fraud could be as high as €2 billion. Source: Dissecting Operation High Roller Video News Report “Biggest cyber bank robbery in history” from Sky News via The Daily Sheeple: For the last week the Royal Bank of Scotland has been plagued with problems that have made it impossible for its 12 million customers to access cash via ATM's, maintain their accounts online or to even withdraw money at their local bank branches. Though the issues affecting RBS may be unrelated, they have alarmed many observers as indicators of problems within the European financial and banking systems. Silver Doctors suggests the attack discovered by McAfee may be to blame for the issues experienced by RBS: Sky News is reporting that McAfee Virus has uncovered a series of financial attacks on US, UK, and Euro-zone banks with individual transfers of over €100,000 being reported. Is this an extension of RBS' NatWest's complete banking system melt-down/ cash account rehypothecation, which is now in its 8th day? Our thoughts are this is either an Iranian ‘Stuxnet' retaliation, or a false-flag banking system lock up by the Western Central Banks themselves on which they can conveniently pin the blame for an imminent derivative induced contagion and banking collapse. Source: Silver Doctors via SGT Report Governments have needed a pretext to tighten banking regulations and gain even more authority over the individual movement of capital. Whether real or a false flag, this cyberattack may very well give them the ammunition they need to take complete control of the internet.

Uber is facing fresh questions from the U.S. Congress after it initially suppressed details about a data breach that affected more than 57 million of its drivers and riders in 2016.
In a series of letters sent to the ride-hailing company on Monday, Democrats and Republicans alike pressed Uber to detail why it hadn't informed customers sooner, whether it has spoken with law enforcement agencies about the matter and what exactly it's doing to help drivers whose sensitive data was stolen.
To all of the lawmakers that wrote Uber, though, the incident also amounted to just the latest misstep by a tech giant that's repeatedly faced a litany of government probes for its controversial business practices.
It's not just that the company “concealed the breach without notifying affected drivers and consumers,” began a group of four Republicans, led by Sen. John Thune, in their note to the company Monday. It's that “prior privacy concerns at Uber” make it “a serious incident that merits further scrutiny.”
Asked about the letter, an Uber spokesperson said the company has “been in contact with members of Congress and the relevant committees to inform them of the situation,” adding: “We are working to respond to their inquiries and address their concerns."
The barrage of criticism Monday came days after Uber revealed that the company — at the time under the leadership of Travis Kalanick — fell victim to a major security breach in 2016 and paid the hackers a $100,000 ransom to transfer the stolen data back. The information taken included names, phone numbers, email addresses, and in the case of 600,000 of its drivers, their license data, too.
In sharing those findings last week — perhaps hoping to do so under the cover of the Thanksgiving holiday — new Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the company's chief security officer had been fired. Uber also added new security aides to help it further investigate the breach.
Still, Khosrowshahi's apology hasn't satisfied federal regulators, including Thune and three other Senate Republicans, who lead key committees that oversee tech, telecom, finance and data security.
In their letter, sent Monday, the lawmakers demanded that Uber detail a full timeline as to what it discovered about the breach, as well as which state and federal law enforcement or regulatory agencies the company informed about the incident. They also asked Uber to assure that riders' and drivers' other critical, sensitive information had not been stolen.
Among lawmakers' additional concerns: Federal officials use Uber, so Senate Republicans are trying to “identify and mitigate potential consumer harm and identity-theft-related fraud against federal programs,” they wrote.
Uber's replies could carry serious political and legal repercussions. Forty-eight states have laws on their books that require companies to inform consumers promptly whenever their information has been stolen — and in many cases, the theft of Uber drivers' license numbers would have required the ride-hailing company to make the breach public. To that end, at least five states' attorneys general are investigating Uber on related grounds, Recode first reported last week.
Meanwhile, the four Republicans asked Uber if it had disclosed details of the breach to the Federal Trade Commission. The agency had been investigating Uber at the time of the incident in 2016 for another, unrelated privacy and security mishap. If Uber did not inform the FTC, it could face additional penalties.
Echoing some of those same concerns was Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who sent their own letter to Uber on Monday. In asking for more information about why it hadn't disclosed the breach sooner, they also pressed Uber to explain why it didn't have a more secure system to handle payments.
Warner further demanded that Uber share how it managed to find the hackers in the first place. While they acknowledged that the company could have discovered the criminals using forensics, Warner said that Uber's “past pattern of conduct” still causes them to wonder if the ride-hailing app essentially tried to “hack back” its hackers. That's illegal under federal law, Warner reminded.
Once Uber found the hackers, though, it paid them a $100,000 ransom and required them to sign a nondisclosure agreement. To Warner, that “thwarts law enforcement's ability to bring criminal hackers to justice.”
Legends of the Hidden Temple was a classic Nickelodeon game show that aired from 1993 to 1995. Years later, it was also the inspiration for countless group Halloween costumes for nostalgic people who were too lazy to be the Spice Girls. And now, since everything old is new again, it's going to be a TV movie on the network that aired it in the first place.
Variety reports that Nickelodeon isn't exactly bringing back the game show. Instead, it's using it as the inspiration for a fictional movie, which follows three siblings who have to survive dangerous obstacles. But Olmec, the talking head from the show will be back, as will the Steps of Knowledge, and a green monkey, a red jaguar, and silver snakes. And if those are around, the Shrine of the Silver Monkey basically has to show up at the end.
There's no word about whether Kirk Fogg will be back, but here's hoping. Just last month, the host ruined all our childhoods by revealing that there was a man behind Olmec's face controlling its movement, and the show's small budget was the reason why basically nobody ever won.

List of bird species related to the goose
This is a list of Anseriformes species by global population. While numbers are estimates, they have been made by the experts in their fields.
Anseriformes (Anser being Latin for "goose") is the taxonomic order to which the ducks, geese, swan, and screamers belong. BirdLife International has assessed 166 species; 89 (54% of total species) have had their population estimated. A variety of methods are used for counting waterfowl. For example, in North America, national and sub-national agencies use planes and helicopters to make aerial transects of breeding populations, and extrapolate these counts over the species' known ranges. Methodologies are continuously being refined; thus estimates can be expected to become more accurate over time. Forecasts can be made by studying habitat condition trends and by interviewing local experts.[1] For more information on how these estimates were ascertained, see Wikipedia's articles on population biology and population ecology.
The first bird in this list, the crested shelduck, retains a status of Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List but may in fact be extinct. The last confirmed reporting was in 1964 near Vladivostok. North Korea claimed a sighting in March 1971, but this record is highly suspect. Unconfirmed reports do, however, periodically roll in from Northeast China, giving scientists hope that the last individual has not yet died.[2] To be assessed as Critically Endangered a species must have experienced a decline of at least 80% in the past ten years or three generations, or be projected to decline that much in the future ten years or three generations.[3] As some species below are rapidly approaching their minimum viable population (MVP), the future may see their removal from the list and addition to the preceding paragraph.

The $85 million project would include a nine-screen movie theater, about 200 apartments, a 600-stall parking garage, an outdoor climbing wall over Court Avenue, a jazz club and office space.
A local developer wants to build an $85 million mixed-use development at Fifth and Court avenues anchored by a 32-story apartment tower. In this rendering, the proposed tower is shown at center in the Des Moines skyline. (Photo: Architecture by Studio Melee, illustrations by PUSHpixel/Special to the Register) Story Highlights The 32-story building would include a 25-story apartment tower above a seven-story parking ramp.
An upscale, nine-screen movie theater would be on the ground level.
An outdoor climbing wall would rise above Court Avenue and jazz club would face Walnut Street.
The $85 million project would replace a city-owned parking ramp. It would take two years to build.
Justin Mandelbaum has been looking for a way to bring a movie theater back to downtown Des Moines.
What's interesting about the local real estate developer's latest proposal is what they want to build above the theater.
Mandelbaum plans to construct a 32-story, $85 million mixed-use building at Fifth and Court avenues. It would be the fourth-tallest building in the state, and the tallest built since the 45-story 801 Grand office in 1991.
Their plans call for about 200 apartments, a 600-stall parking ramp and a small amount of office space. There would be a nine-screen movie theater, an indoor/outdoor climbing gym and a jazz club on Walnut Street.
It would replace a city-owned parking garage that city officials have been looking to demolish to make way for new development.
“I think it will be a catalyst for downtown,” Mandelbaum said. “It will increase the vitality of downtown and firmly establish downtown as the metro area's premier place to live, work and play.”
Construction could begin in late 2016 at the earliest, and it would take at least two years to complete, they said.
Behind the project is Mandelbaum Properties, a development firm that includes Mandelbaum and their father and brother.
The plan is coming to light now because the Des Moines City Council on Monday will consider an initial step in the approval process: establishing a 60-day waiting period during which other developers can submit proposals for the site.
The waiting period is a new process spurred by a recent proposal to develop a city-owned parking lot in the East Village. One local developer complained that the city should not sell large, strategically located pieces of city-owned property without opening the process so other developers can make pitches.
If successful, Mandelbaum would build one of the first residential high rises in the city in years.
Developers have been rapidly building five- to six-story mid-rise apartments downtown, but many have balked at the cost of steel construction needed for taller buildings.
A prime example is the Riverfront YMCA site. City officials and downtown advocates have said the two-acre site on the Des Moines River is well-suited to a high-rise apartment or condo building.
But no such plans have materialized.

West Des Moines-based Hubbell Realty has proposed a five-story wood-construction apartment building for the site. Hubbell CEO Rick Tollakson has said the rental rates downtown are too low to make steel-frame, high-rise construction economically viable.
Real estate brokers have said a high-rise development at the YMCA site would require apartment rental rates of more than $2 per square foot, while average downtown apartments rent for about $1.40 a square foot.
Mandelbaum said their apartments would offer high-end amenities and command rental rates at the top of the market. But they said they could not yet pin down a price point.
They previously considered developing the Riverfront Y site, but said the Fifth Avenue property is better suited to a high-end residential tower because it's attached to the skywalk and sits closer to the Court Avenue entertainment district and major downtown employers.
Another key component is the parking garage. It would be owned, leased or subsidized by the city, providing a key financial building block around which to fund the project.
“I think the city component — the parking garage — changes a lot of the economics,” they said. “I've probably looked at the Y site more than anybody, and I think this is a totally different ballgame.”
Mandelbaum is not alone in their high-rise aspirations.
Des Moines-based Nelson Construction and Development has proposed building a 10-story luxury apartment tower above a new parking ramp planned at Seventh Street and Grand Avenue.
CEO Mike Nelson said they think Mandelbaum has a good location for a high-rise.
“I think it's yet to be seen whether we have the (rental) rates to support it, but it's definitely trending in that direction,” Nelson said.
Assistant City Manager Matt Anderson said they believe a high-rise with high-end apartments is viable downtown.
“There are two schools of thought,” they said. “There are developers who say we're not ready and (high-end apartments) haven't been tested, but you don't know until you test it. It's a piece of the market that is absolutely not being tested.”
Mandelbaum, a Des Moines native, worked for private equity firms before returning to Des Moines in 2008. They made a splash last year when they announced plans to renovate an empty downtown office building at 900 Keosauqua Way into nearly 200 artist studios.
They previously proposed a movie theater at 420 Court Ave., directly across the street from the site of their new proposal. When the city opted to go with Hy-Vee's grocery store proposal instead, Mandelbaum vowed to find a new location for a downtown theater.
“When I came to Des Moines it was to have a positive impact through creative real estate projects,” they said.
Bringing movies back downtown
It's been more than a decade since moviegoers could catch a movie downtown.
Developer Justin Mandelbaum wants to change that. They plan to build a movie theater at Fifth and Court avenues as part of a 32-story high-rise development.
The $85 million project would include about 200 apartments, a parking ramp, a jazz club and other amenities. But the impetus was the need for a downtown theater, Mandelbaum said.
“This first and foremost is a movie theater project,” they said.
Omaha-based Main Street Theatres would operate the facility. Mandelbaum described it as a luxury theater, offering beer and wine, prepared foods and recliner seating, and a lobby bar and restaurant.
Once the place to catch a show, downtown's last theater —the River Hills-Riviera — closed in 2001 to make way for Wells Fargo Arena.
The landmark Paramount Theater was demolished in 1979 and the Value Cinema 7, a second-run theater at Fifth and Grand avenues, closed in 1998.
Today, the Science Center of Iowa shows IMAX films downtown. The Fleur Cinema & Cafe and the Varsity Theatre are both a few miles from the city's core, but there are no traditional, first-run theaters within four-and-a-half miles of downtown.
“You basically have a movie theater desert, and at the epicenter of it is downtown,” Mandelbaum said.
Downtown parking could be limited during construction
The plan to demolish a parking ramp at Fifth and Court avenues to make way for a 32-story mixed-use project raises questions about the supply of parking downtown.
The new development would include roughly the same amount of parking spaces, but it would leave a hole in the city's parking system while being built.
Complicating the matter is the city's plan to demolish another aging parking ramp at Seventh Street and Grand Avenue. Plans call for it to be replaced by a similar mixed-use development with apartments and parking.
Assistant City Manager Matt Anderson said the city will study the downtown parking supply to determine if there is enough parking for both projects to proceed simultaneously. If not, the Fifth and Court development could be delayed.
“We will not leave downtown in a parking crunch,” they said. “That's going to weigh very heavily on our decision on the timing.”

Tyson Chandler was supposed to represent the Bulls of the 2000s, the presumptive second coming of another great era, though the 2.0 version. Taller and quick, adept and athletic. The Bulls cashed in their post-championship era bounty, the No .1 overall draft pick in 1999, Elton Brand, for the right to draft Chandler and pair them with fellow teenaged seven footer Eddy Curry to form what they hoped and believed could be the foundation of a structure that would overshadow the NBA once again for years to come.
Instead, as we know, it came to encapsulate the misery that befell the franchise for the first years of the new millennium, a historic losing period that both humbled and heartened the franchise to move forward and again over the last seven years to become among the league's elite contenders.
But the Bulls would have to endure the humiliation and hardship first, and unfairly it initially fell upon Chandler, a sensitive kid whose growing pains mirrored that of a franchise attempting to be reborn.
“I didn't have a clue (of what was coming),” said Chandler, who grew into an NBA All-Star, champion Olympian and Defensive Player of the Year and now is in their 15th season with their sixth team. “I was 18 years old, coming in not knowing what to expect from the NBA, the Bulls; just trying to find my way.
“I think what happened, now for me being 15 years in the league, they weren't ready for that at that time,” Chandler said in a recent interview. “It wouldn't be too much to ask if it had been the correct transition. It (drafting straight from high school) was new to the league in general, taking guys that young. The league is now more prepared to help groom young players and help them grow and develop.
“It was a tough growing period, a tough time, also for the organization,” said the 7-1 Chandler. “We went through three head coaches and two interims. Three heads coaches and a couple of interims meant there was change in management with Jerry Krause to John Paxson. There was so much going on. Different players every single year. We'd have four new players at a time. I think the organization was trying to find themselves clearly after the Jordan era, the Scottie Pippen era. They were trying to figure it out and I think the worst thing to do was bring two 18-year-olds to the organization and try to figure it out that way.”
If anything, the Bulls of that time provided a blueprint for the rest of the NBA for what not to do.
Not that then general manager Jerry Krause's plan was wrong. It wasn't.
While a team built around Brand, Ron Artest, Jamal Crawford, Marcus Fizer and free agents like Ron Mercer and Brad Miller may have eventually been competitive—as the team of 2000-01—it didn't have a high ceiling for success.
Krause's dream had been to rebuild a team from the base through the draft and scouting expertise after inheriting Jordan when they became general manager in 1985. So after the lockout 1998-99 season when Jordan retired and Pippen was accommodated with a sign and trade to Houston and Toni Kukoc was later traded to Philadelphia, Krause accumulated draft picks similar to the model used lately by the Philadelphia 76ers.
Krause decided to cash them in for the 2000 draft, using three firsts and three seconds in what turned out to be an overall weak draft.
“It was a great fan base,” said Crawford, who remains a Sixth Man of the Year candidate again with the contending Clippers. “They still gave us great support from the championship years and were patient. It's just that we were so young. There were just too many young guys. Even if we had done what the Lakers are doing now with two young guys it would have been better. You needed some stability, but I will say there were some interesting practices.”
Krause hired college coach Tim Floyd with the idea—again, worse in practice than in philosophy like with drafting of Curry and Chandler—that a college coach would relate better to young players. But Floyd came in blinded by the NBA glamour and immediately wanted veterans to compete now instead of grooming kids.
It only made a bad situation worse, and especially for Chandler in trying to grow. Bill Cartwright replaced Floyd, Paxson replaced Krause and then Scott Skiles replaced Cartwright all within about two years as the team would miss the playoffs for six consecutive seasons and in that span have the poorest overall record in NBA history. The victims were players as much as fans.
These days from the crow's nest of their ship that has sailed to an NBA championship when they were with the Dallas Mavericks, Chandler can look back with the wisdom of experience.
“It was pressure,” they agree. “Just because I had expectations for myself as well. The biggest thing was trying to come in and find my way and try to help turn the franchise around. I'd won my entire life to that point and just wanted to win. I didn't understand how the league was. I wasn't expecting to walk into what I walked into, to be honest.
“It was so tough,” Chandler recalls. “I remember where I just felt like I was going to have a breakdown. I'd go home crying. We lost, I can't remember how many games, my rookie year (61, which was better than that previous two). I remember in Orlando, I was so angry and frustrated and not playing much at that time and I had tears in my eyes and it was frustration and I remember Tim Floyd said ‘What's wrong with you?' I was like, ‘I'm sick of losing, I hate this.' They go, ‘Kid, you have a long way to go.' We broke the huddle, but I'll never learn to get used to the losing stuff. It was part of my personality not to accept losing like that.
“I had a lot of those moments,” Tyson reveals. “Eventually, the team started to get better. But at the same time, for me, it felt like my place there started to be in question, whether I would be a part of the future and I ended up being traded. I felt like I had a lot of talent and a lot of ability to really produce and affect the game, which ended up happening once I left.”
Chandler was traded by the Bulls after the 2005-06 season for P.J. Brown and J.R. Smith, the latter quickly moved on to Denver for second round picks.
The Bulls had begun the turnaround under Skiles with the millennium version of the Baby Bulls with the drafting of Kirk Hinrich, Luol Deng and Ben Gordon. The Bulls went on to win 47 games and then were 41-41 and scared eventual champion Miami in a tough six-game playoff in 2006.
Curry was traded to the Knicks with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney and a first round pick that became the Tyrus Thomas pick when the Bulls swapped the rights to the LaMarcus Aldridge pick. But the Bulls had included a right to swap future picks that enabled the Bulls to draft Joakim Noah. The Knicks selected Wilson Chandler with the pick the Bulls had.
And thus the core was almost in place for what looked like a championship run after the Bulls swept the defending champion Miami Heat in the first round of the 2007 playoffs, but then fell back the following season and Skiles was fired. The Bulls went on to miss the playoffs in 2008, but the shocking consolation was the lottery luck to the No. 1 pick and Derrick Rose.
The Bulls went to the conference finals in 2011 as Rose grew to be the league's MVP and one of the most dynamic players in NBA history. Who knows how far it would have gone as they won the most games in the regular season in 2011-12 for the second straight year under coach Tom Thibodeau. Rose suffered the catastrophic ACL injury in Game 1 of the 2012 playoffs with the Bulls the favorites among many to knock off the Heat and LeBron James. Rose went on to have two more knee surgeries and now is working their way back with a Bulls team fighting to make the playoffs this season.
But there were some brilliant and exciting times even with Rose in and out of the lineup over three years.
Like the Greatest First Round Series Ever Played, the seven overtimes seven gamer between the Bulls and Boston Celtics in 2009. It was Rose's welcome to stardom.
Rose shocked the defending champion Celtics and tied Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's rookie record for points in a first playoff game. The Bulls with Rose's 36 points beat the Celtics in overtime to turn the series on its head. Tyrus Thomas actually saved the game in overtime after Rose fouled out. Kevin Garnett was out injured for the Celtics, but the Bulls' opening win after a 41-41 season would kick off one of the wildest playoff series in NBA history.
Boston's Ray Allen would score 30 points and their team the win in the Game 2 shootout with Ben Gordon, who scored 42 points. Allen made the winner in what was being called the best game of the season. Until the next few.
Gordon hit a late bank shot in regulation and the Bulls went on to win Game 4 in two overtimes. Game 5 went to the Celtics at home but not before what should have been a flagrant foul on Rajon Rondo on Brad Miller at the end of regulation with Miller bleeding and trying to make free throws. The Bulls lost 106-104 in overtime to set up a triple overtime spectacular Game 6 with Ray Allen's 51 points not enough in the United Center. The image of that series and the triple overtime Bulls win—seven overtime periods in the series and six in three games—was Noah taking the ball from Pierce and running down to slam to close out the third overtime. The Bulls didn't have much left for Game 7 and lost in Boston despite 33 from Gordon.
Then there was 2013 and an ailing and broken down Bulls team with Rose and Kirk Hinrich and Luol Deng going out as the series progressed and turning to Nate Robinson and then Noah for the upset.
The Nets won the first game, but the Bulls stole home court advantage with a win in the second and then took a 2-1 lead back home. Then came the amazing Game 4, yet another triple overtime fest in which Robinson off the bench scored 34 points in just under 29 minutes. Robinson had a personal 12-0 run as part of 23 fourth quarter points after the Bulls trailed by 14 in one of the biggest scoring quarters in franchise history to get the Bulls to overtime. Finally, in the third overtime, Nazr Mohammed's four points were enough to carry the Bulls to victory and a 3-1 series lead. After playing 60 minutes in that game, Hinrich was done for the playoffs. Similarly, after the next game, which the Nets won back home, Deng was done for the series with an illness scare and hospitalization.
That left the Bulls facing a Game 7 back in Brooklyn after losing Game 6 at home without Hinrich and Deng and looking like no Joakim Noah in Game 7 with serious foot problems. But Noah came out with all the grit they had. The Nets were done. The Bulls spurted to a 17-point halftime lead over the stunned Nets as Noah played 41 minutes on their foot injury. They accumulated 24 points, 14 rebounds and six blocks in rallying a team starting Robinson and the bench basically consisting of Mohammed, Marquis Teague and Daequan Cook. Jimmy Butler played all 48 minutes for the second straight game and would play all 48 minutes in three of the five games in the next round, which would start after one day off, in a five-game loss to the Miami Heat and LeBron James.
There were so many almosts and could have beens, and it started with what may have been. Krause had the right plan with a post up seven footers in Curry and what they projected as a perimeter seven footers in Chandler, though Chandler would evolve into the natural center. It just was the wrong guys given their ages. And at the wrong time with the wrong mix.
“I don't have any ill feelings toward the organization,” says Chandler. “I still show John Paxson all the love in the world. I still respected them even when they traded me. It was a respectful situation and how they dealt with it and me. I feel like all of that had to happen. It was an organization in transition, and a young player trying to learn and find their way. If I could change anything it would have been for the organization to be more where they are now, seven or eight years down the road from me being drafted. That wasn't the case. I understand now looking back what I was walking into, but then I hadn't a clue.”
Nor did the Bulls.
“It was part of my growing up that made me respect the league that much more, respect winning that much more, made me respect the game that much more because I had been through those tough times in Chicago,” says Chandler. “I understand the good from the bad, what you are supposed to do as a player and what you are not supposed to do as a player, a good coach and a bad coach, and I learned all those things and how to decipher those things and I learned a lot about myself in those times with the Bulls. I think it made me the player I became and I appreciate everything I went through when I was there.
“I never considered myself to be a victim,” says Chandler. “I felt I was blessed to be in the league and playing the game I love. If you look at it now and I'm a GM, it's a learning curve. Now I see if you are going to draft a young player like that you need the right coach, the right coaches around him, the right players and the organization has to be ready and have a plan for the young man or else he'll have to figure it out themselves and then you are rolling the dice. It was some dark days.”
They got much brighter for the Bulls and Chandler and they both became better for their experiences. There always are better times to come.
Ants comprise one lineage of the triumvirate of eusocial insects and experienced their early diversification within the Cretaceous []. Their ecological success is generally attributed to their remarkable social behavior. Not all ants cooperate in social hunting, however, and some of the most effective predatory ants are solitary hunters with powerful trap jaws []. Recent evolutionary studies predict that the early branching lineages of extant ants formed small colonies of ground-dwelling, solitary specialist predators [], while some Cretaceous fossils suggest group recruitment and socially advanced behavior among stem-group ants []. We describe a trap-jaw ant from 99 million-year-old Burmese amber with head structures that presumably functioned as a highly specialized trap for large-bodied prey. These are a cephalic horn resulting from an extreme modification of the clypeus hitherto unseen among living and extinct ants and scythe-like mandibles that extend high above the head, both demonstrating the presence of exaggerated morphogenesis early among stem-group ants. The new ant belongs to the Haidomyrmecini, possibly the earliest ant lineage [], and together these trap-jaw ants suggest that at least some of the earliest Formicidae were solitary specialist predators. With their peculiar adaptations, haidomyrmecines had a refined ecology shortly following the advent of ants.
Abbreviations are as follows: amd, apical portion of mandibles; bmd, basal portion of mandibles; btmd, basal tooth of mandible; ce, compound eye; cls, clypeal setae; es, epistomal sulcus; ho, horn; mp, maxillary palps; sc, scape; sl, setose lobe; th, trigger hair; to, torulus. See also Figures S1 and S2 and Table S1
Diagnosis. Differs from all other extinct and living ants by the presence, in workers, of a long cephalic horn arising from between the antennal insertions and curved forward and by very long, scythe-like mandibles, their tips reaching above head near to the horn's apex. The horn is spatulate apically, and its undersurface is densely setose, with a semi-circular brush of peg-like spicules along edges. Two pairs of long trigger hairs are each flanking the apical portion of mandibles. The combination of distinct ocelli and subpetiolar process also serves to distinguish the genus from other haidomyrmecines.
The vast majority of Cretaceous ants belong to stem-group Formicidae and comprise workers and reproductives of largely generalized morphologies [], and it is difficult to draw clear conclusions about their ecology, although recent discoveries from Cretaceous Burmese amber suggest relatively advanced social levels []. Remarkable exceptions to this pattern of generalized morphologies are ants with bizarre mouthparts such as Zigrasimecia, Camelomecia, and five species composing the Haidomyrmecini in which both female castes (workers and reproductives; males are unknown) have modified heads and blade-like mandibles that uniquely move in a vertical rather than horizontal plane []. Haidomyrmecines have puzzled evolutionary biologists as to their specific ecology, the mandibles apparently acting as traps triggered by sensory hairs in a way distinct from that of modern trap-jaw ants []. Nonetheless, even within haidomyrmecines, there has been relatively little morphological disparity, and their ecology as solitary or social hunters, and as dietary specialists or generalists, remains obscure. Here, we report four individual fossils of a new haidomyrmecine ant species with extraordinary head structures that presumably function as a highly specialized trap for large-bodied prey. The specimens were found in four different pieces of amber from the Hukawng Valley in northern Myanmar, dated radiometrically at 99 mega-annum [].

Grimaldi D.A. Adaptive radiation in socially advanced stem-group ants from the Cretaceous. Trap jaws have evolved independently at least four times in ants, occurring in 11 genera from four subfamilies (indicated in gray on topology; circled numbers refer to earliest trap-jaw fossils known: 1, Haidomyrmodes mammuthus; 2, various Odontomachus and Anochetus species; 3, Acanthognathus poinari). Thick lines denote the temporal range known for each subfamily. Relationships and divergence times among lineages are based on previous molecular and morphological hypotheses []. Ceratomyrmex has distinctive features of the haidomyrmecines such as the concave face and the scythe-like mandibles moving in a vertical plane, their apical portion flanked by two pairs of long trigger hairs inserted on the clypeus. The most striking feature of Ceratomyrmex is its unique cranio-mandibular system—the horn and trigger hairs evidently operate as a sensory complex to judge the distance of a target before eliciting closure of the oversized mandibles, presumably to subdue, puncture, and crush prey or opponents, and alternatively for contact with nestmates without eliciting a strike. Although differently constructed and in no way representing a common evolutionary origin, such trap jaws and their associated trigger hairs are known elsewhere among foragers of three extant ant subfamilies [] ( Figure 2 ), and such mandibular specializations across those lineages are known in the Cenozoic []. It is not surprising that predatory behavior should be present among stem-group ants, particularly as related aculeate families are virtually all predatory to some degree or other []. The other non-haidomyrmecine stem-group ants are likely to have been mostly generalist predators, except maybe Zigrasimecia and Camelomecia []. It is remarkable that among the haidomyrmecines there was an early origin of specialized, trap jaws and that this should be taken to such an exaggerated extreme in Ceratomyrmex. The previously dubbed “clypeal setose lobe” presumably functioned as a stabilizing structure when pressure was applied by the mandibles that braced the prey against the face, offering friction to minimize movement that might cause the victim to be dropped.
25 Boucot A.J.
Poinar Jr., G.O. Fossil Behavior Compendium. Spine-like cuticular expansions are frequent in ants, present in genera of various subfamilies, but are not linked to hunting strategies. These expansions can form short paired spines on the head (e.g., Acromyrmex), paired lateral spines on the pronotum or propodeum (e.g., Polyrhachis), or more rarely a single median spine on the propodeum or petiole (e.g., Acanthoponera). A mediocephalic horn acting as a sensory appendage is a novel organ hitherto never seen among living and fossil ants. This projection is longer than the head and projects high above and forward, with dense long setae on its undersurface and facing to elongate mandibles that reach nearly to its spatulate apex. Together these structures define, along with the surface of the face, a broad cavity in which large prey might be held. Such structures would also permit, with a more gentle touch, the movement of larvae and pupae within the nest. Such behaviors are well known among extant ant lineages and have even been observed in Cenozoic amber inclusions of extant genera [].

Figure 3 Homologies in the Clypeo-Mandibular Complex of Selected Stem-Group Ants Show full caption (A–D) The clypeus varies from transverse (A and B) to longitudinal (C and D), its anterior margin (a-cpm) from convex (A) to concave (B–D). The arrangement of clypeal spicules varies from one row along a-cpm (A and B) to a brushy lobe along posterior clypeal margin (C) or apically on a protruding horn (D). The mandibles vary from short, not elbowed (A) to short elbowed (B) or elongate elbowed (C and D) and, when closed, with no gap between apical portion and a-cpm (A), or with large (B and C) to huge (D) gap. Genera omitted: Sphecomyrma, similar to Gerontoformica except clypeal spicules absent; Haidomyrmodes and Haidoterminus, similar to Haidomyrmex. See also Figure S3 The setose lobe unique to haidomyrmecines, situated far from the anterior margin of head and flanking the antennal insertions in Haidomyrmex, Haidomyrmodes, and Haidoterminus, was considered previously as a modification of the clypeus []. This unique conformation was questionable since, in all other ants, the anterior clypeal margin is always contiguous with the oral cavity []. The epistomal sulcus, which marks the lateral and posterior clypeal outlines, has not been clear in haidomyrmecines studied so far, but the setose lobe appeared to be separated from the anterior edge of head and following the oral cavity, suggesting that it is not the clypeus. Specimens of Ceratomyrmex as well as new Haidomyrmex specimens from Burmese amber have the face sufficiently preserved to ascertain the course of the epistomal sulcus ( Figures 1 B and S3 A–S3C). The clypeus appears as a pair of lateral sclerites on each side of an elevated median portion extending longitudinally from above the oral cavity to the ventral base of the prominent, pyramidal frontal triangle (a structure immediately posterior to the clypeus, inserted between antennal sockets, but generally not prominent nor obvious []). The elevated median portion of the clypeus consists, in Haidomyrmex, of a mushroom-shaped shelf anteriorly with a narrow triangular stem and posteriorly with a hemispheric brushy lobe, while in Ceratomyrmex, it consists of a single longitudinal carina posteriorly projecting into the horn, with the brushy lobe moved apically on the horn ( Figures 3 C and 3D). It is unclear whether the frontal lobe is fused with the dorsal base of the horn or is just not as prominent as in other haidomyrmecines. The trigger hairs are present in a place homologous to that of other haidomyrmecines, slightly below the antennal sockets on the elevated median clypeal portion, and thereby supporting the homology of the entire horn of Ceratomyrmex with the setose pad of other Haidomyrmecini. While the trigger hairs are assuredly sensory structures that would make contact with a prey prior to closure of the mandibles, or with a nestmate (without a strike), the clypeal pad likely served a stabilizing function, although it certainly also had a sensory purpose. Its shorter form in other haidomyrmecines would have excluded its ability to receive any tactile information from prey prior to ensnarement. It could have provided information on pressure when prey was appressed against the head. In Ceratomyrmex, the typical function of the clypeal pad must have been further elaborated, as the setae are more elongate and the structure itself extends well in front of the ant, suggesting specialization on some large-bodied prey for which a greater grasp was required.

Suarez A.V. The evolution and functional morphology of trap-jaw ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). 27 Larabee F.J.
Suarez A.V. Mandible-powered escape jumps in trap-jaw ants increase survival rates during predator-prey encounters. Trap-jaw ants are typically highly predatory and dietary generalists, although some species specialize on particular arthropods, and a few even harvest seeds []. The extreme morphogenesis observed in Ceratomyrmex implies a unique specialization for predation among this early ant lineage, prior to anything similar among the Formicidae. Indeed, the arrangement of the mouthparts and clypeal structures would have made it challenging for Ceratomyrmex to effectively capture small arthropod prey as they would have had a greater chance of escape before the mandibles closed against the face (and thereby presumably with the horn not being capable of playing a role in such entrapment) or would have had an easier time slipping laterally within the large space created by the horn, face, and mandibles. By contrast, the ant could approach larger prey with the mandibles opened, positioned to project beneath a potential quarry. Once the extended trigger hairs would be tripped, the mandibles would rise rapidly, pinning the sufferer against the horn and face. The setae from the brushy lobe would offer friction and potentially information as to the placement and movement of the victim. Moreover, it could be surmised that these structures were exclusive for manipulating nest materials or food other than prey. If this were the case, it would be impossible to explain the presence of trigger hairs, which are known exclusively in carnivorous, trap-jaw lineages. Alternatively, the trigger hairs were long enough to be tripped when the mandibles were closed; thus, Ceratomyrmex could also have snapped its mandibles open to stun prey, to fling attackers away, or to launch themselves away from a potential threat, similarly to what is observed in some modern trap-jaw ants []. An exclusive defense function is excluded, however, because the horn and setose lobe would then be useless.
Episode 452: How Much Should We Trust Economics?
Three years ago, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff published a study that quickly became one of the most famous, most talked about economics papers since the financial crisis. It got so much attention because it answered a basic question everybody was asking: How much debt is too much?
Reinhart and Rogoff looked at what had happened in many different countries over many years. And they found a what looked like a clear debt threshold: 90 percent. Average growth was much, much slower in countries with debt-to-gdp ratios over 90 percent.
The paper got a lot of coverage in the press. Politicians cited it in the U.S. and Europe.
Then, this week, a 28-year-old grad student and their professors published a startling finding: Reinhart and Rogoff had made a simple Excel error in one part of their study. The authors of the new critique also questioned other elements of the study and argued that, in fact, there is no debt threshold.
On today's show, we hear from the grad student who found the error. And we ask: How much should we trust economics?

A mother of a four-year-old-boy gives them a bath. At one point they grab their penis and washes it with a kind of fierceness. “We have to wash carefully under your foreskin,” they remind him. They spend about five minutes washing their penis. The boy giggles and enjoys the experience. Their penis becomes erect. They feel peculiar when their mother touches their private part, but doesn't know what that means. Neither the mother nor the boy thinks of this as sexual abuse. They do it every time they bathe him.
The mother feels guilty because, in order to save money, they didn't circumcise their son when they were younger. This guilt propels them to pay considerable attention to washing under their foreskin. Although they are not acting out of sexual desire, their behavior is sexually inappropriate. The ultimate result is that the boy grows up to be a man who prefers masturbation over sexual intercourse. All women to them are mothers who will cross their sexual boundaries. All women arouse their castration fear.
Studies and observations by experts seem to confirm that sexual abuse of children by females is rising, at least In England. Detectives at Scotland Yard's Paedophile Unit reported an “increased prevalence” of female offenders. But police sources said that estimating the number of pedophiles in the UK was problematic, since the vast majority of such cases are not reported. Indeed, the topic of female sexual abuse of children is largely hidden under a shroud of secrecy. We do not like to think of mothers or women as sexual abusers. The case described above is a case in point. Many lay people would say this is just a mother being a mother. But if a father bathed their daughter and spent 5 minutes washing their vagina, it would definitely be seen as sexual abuse.
Researchers at the Lucy Faithfull Foundation (LFF), a child protection charity in the UK that focuses on British female sex offenders, maintains that female child sex abuse is more widespread than people suspect. Studies by LFF confirmed that a “fair proportion” of child abusers are women. Donald Findlater, Director of Research, noted that up to 20% of 320,000 suspected UK pedophiles were women. They stressed, however, that these are only the cases that are reported.
Experts divide female sex offenders into three categories. One category, which we often read about in the news, is the young female (often a teacher) who is attracted to sex with an adolescent boy. Such women are often not attracted to men their own age and find an adolescent boy appealing because they are less threatening. These women want to be in control of the sexual relationship and get off on lapping up a juvenile's innocence. They may also get off on seducing a virginal young man.
Another category of female child sex abusers are mothers who abuse their own daughters. Such mothers generally have narcissistic personalities and regard their daughters as rivals. A narcissistic mother may have a need for admiration and an exaggerated sense of self-importance that leads to jealousy of their daughter. Thank of the children's story,” Snow White,” in which the queen is jealous of Snow White and orders them to be killed.
An associated category constitutes mothers who molest their own children; they are sometimes referred to as “mother molesters” and, according to one report, comprise a significant proportion of female child sex offenders. The article cited research that contended women are 4.5 times more likely to offend against their biological child than men, as well as other children in their care. Often such women have been abused themselves as children and are viewed as acting out an addiction.
Yet another category is passive women who sexually abuse a child, usually their own child, while under the influence of a male pedophile. Such women are not pedophiles themselves but are influenced to act that way by a dominant male figure in their lives. Often that figure is someone close to them, such as a boyfriend.
According to a study in Advances in Clinical Child Psychology, 40-80% of child sex offenders have themselves been victims of sexual abuse. Since they were sexually abused as children and the experience seemed normal, they often feel little guilt about abusing a child later on when they are an adult. This statistic covers all perpetrators, male and female.
And then again, most experts point out the double standard in the way male and female sexual abusers are viewed. “In society, it used to be that with a 13- or 14-year-old male, if their first sexual experience involved a 25-year-old girl who may well have taken advantage of him, their male counterparts may say, ‘Hey, you lucked out,'” noted Dr. Richard Gartner. “It was almost seen as a rite of passage. That's the only group that later recalls such experiences as ‘lucking out.' You don't find that in females. Today, that kind of behavior is regarded as sexual assault.”
This is another reason why female sexual abuse of children is underreported. Gartner goes on to emphasize the often disguised nature of the problem. “Adults can be very clever,” said Gartner. “With female assault of boys, children, the abuse can often happen in the guise of something dealing with cleanliness, like during bathing. … There seems to be very little [in society] out there for a boy to feel like their betrayal is validated.” Because of this double standard, boys are much less likely to think of themselves as sexually abused and much less able or willing to report it. Often they are laughed at by police if they report it. However, it is because of this double standard that a boy who is sexually abused becomes confused about the abuse and later confused about their sexuality. They may find themselves attracted to children when they become an adult, without any understanding of why they have such attractions. Their sexual development remains stunted.
Clearly, there needs to be more research on female sexual abusers and the victims of female sexual abuse so that we can have a deeper understanding of this growing problem
Two Michigan State University researchers have invented a protein purifier that will make pharmaceutical production quicker and cheaper. Chemists Merlin Bruening and Greg Baker have created high-performance membranes for protein purification, a crucial step in drug development. Purifying proteins, the process of isolating a single, desired protein from all others, is an expensive, time-consuming hurdle that contributes to the high cost of some prescription drugs. Streamlining the process could help manufacturers reduce costs and speed new drugs to consumers. "The membrane devices that we've manufactured can simplify protein purification by rapidly capturing the desired protein as it flows through membrane pores," said Bruening, who has patented the process. "Our membranes have two to three times more capacity than existing commercial devices, and they should reduce the purification process time substantially."
The Cubs have agreed to a one-year, $2MM deal with free agent lefty Brian Duensing, according to Jon Heyman of Fan Rag (Twitter links). Chicago has announced the signing.
Duensing, 33, spent much of the 2016 season in the minors. But they performed rather well there — with a 2.23 ERA and 9.5 K/9 versus 1.7 BB/9 over 32 1/3 innings — and earned a late-season promotion with the Orioles. In fourteen appearances for Baltimore, Duensing allowed six earned runs on 13 hits while recording ten hits against three walks.
Chicago had a need on the southpaw side of its pen, particularly assuming that Mike Montgomery will become a part of the rotation. But it's still a bit surprising to see the defending World Series champs place a bet on Duensing, who is perhaps best characterized as a steadily useful arm. Over their eight-year major league career — the vast bulk of which came with the Twins — they have allowed 4.13 earned per regulation game while striking out 5.9 and walking 2.9 batters per nine to go with a solid (but hardly world-beating 46.3% groundball rate).
The pioneering scientist who created Dolly the sheep has outlined how cells plucked from frozen woolly mammoth carcasses might one day help resurrect the ancient beasts.
The notional procedure – bringing with it echoes of the Jurassic Park films – was spelled out by Sir Ian Wilmut, the Edinburgh-based stem-cell scientist, whose team unveiled Dolly as the world's first cloned mammal in 1996.
Though it is unlikely that a mammoth could be cloned in the same way as Dolly, more modern techniques that convert tissue cells into stem cells could potentially achieve the feat, Wilmut says in an article today for the academic journalism website, The Conversation.
"I've always been very sceptical about the whole idea, but it dawned on me that if you could clear the first hurdle of getting viable cells from mammoths, you might be able to do something useful and interesting," Wilmut told the Guardian.
"I think it should be done as long as we can provide great care for the animal. If there are reasonable prospects of them being healthy, we should do it. We can learn a lot about them," they added.
Woolly mammoths roamed the Earth tens of thousands of years ago in a period called the late Pleistocene. Their numbers began to fall in North America and on mainland Eurasia about 10,000 years ago. Some lived on for a further 6,000 years. Their demise was likely the result of hunting and environmental change.
The prospect of raising woolly mammoths from the dead has gathered pace in recent years as the number of frozen bodies recovered from the Siberian permafrost has soared. The rise comes because the ice is melting, but also because of awareness in the region that there is money in the ancient remains.
Earlier this month, the most complete woolly mammoth carcass ever recovered from Russia was unveiled at an exhibition in Yokohama, Japan. The baby female, nicknamed Yuka, lived about 39,000 years ago, and is remarkable for the preservation of their fur and soft tissues, such as muscle.
Samples from Yuka have been sent to the laboratory of Hwang Woo-suk, the disgraced South Korean stem cell scientist, who, with Russian researchers, hopes to clone the mammoth.
Though Wilmut does not doubt the sincerity of the scientists hoping to clone woolly mammoths with the Dolly technique, they said the idea was "wildly optimistic" because the technical challenges were so tough.
In their article for The Conversation, Wilmut explains the formidable hurdles that stand in the way of scientists who want to clone the beasts. The technique requires scores of healthy mammoth cells and hundreds or thousands of eggs from a closely related species, such as the Asian elephant.
The most immediate problem is that mammoth cells must survive with their DNA intact. In practice, they degenerate quickly at the temperature of melting snow and ice, when most remains are found.
"By the time you've got a bone sticking up in the sunshine, it's effectively too late. You need to get it straight out of the deep freeze, as it were," Wilmut said.
Another problem is that cloning needs a female of a closely related species to provide eggs and to carry the pregnancy achieved with any cloned embryo. The closest living relatives to mammoths are elephants, but these are not plentiful enough to collect eggs from.
"Because there is a danger of elephants becoming extinct, it is clearly not appropriate to try to obtain 500 eggs from elephants," Wilmut writes.
There is an alternative, though. If good-quality cells can be extracted from mammoth remains – and that is a big if – they could be reprogrammed into stem cells using modern procedures. These could then be turned into other kinds of cell, including sperm and eggs. Mice have already been born from sperm and eggs made from stem cells.
"If the cells were from a female, this might provide an alternative source of eggs for use in research, and perhaps in breeding, including the cloning of mammoths.
"From a male they would be sperm, and they might be able to fertilise eggs to produce a new mammoth embryo," Wilmut writes.
But the scientist, who in many peers' eyes should have shared the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine with Sir John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka last year, said it could be 50 years before the techniques for resurrecting the woolly mammoth were perfected. There will be no Pleistocene Park soon.
That gives time for scientists to work out some of other problems that would arise if a mammoth were ever born again.
One concern is that the mammoth would be adapted to frigid conditions while its mother would be used to a hot, dry climate.
Another problem is that one will not be enough. "Ideally, and before too long, you need to provide them with friends and neighbours to interact with," Wilmut said. "The whole issue is what are the effects on the animal's welfare."
None of it will happen unless scientists can pluck good-quality cells from carcasses that have lain in the ice for thousands of years. Will it ever happen? "I would say it's fairly unlikely, but the world is full of surprises," Wilmut said.
It's been a few weeks since season four ended. And with hindsight comes clarity. Ish.
This article contains spoilers for season four of Louie. It also includes reference to sexual assault which might be confronting for some readers.
–
Less than two months ago, on the cusp of its season four premiere, I penned an overview of what made Louie the most unique show on TV. Now that the season finale of the genre-defying sitcom has come and gone, I'm even more convinced of it. Not only has the show remained committed to flipping the bird at the structures and conventions of the form, but it's done so in such a complex and confronting way that audiences and critics were left with a severe case of whiplash. I'm still nursing the curves of my neck.
As a showrunner, Louis C.K. has always willfully steered viewers clear out of their comfort zones — not only to tickle their funny bones, but to knead the largely untouched knots of human experience. Season four was no exception, but it offered more than that, too: after a self-imposed 19-month hiatus, Louis delivered what is perhaps the most divisive scene in their show's history — one that didn't merely catch viewers off guard, but moved some permanently off-side.
On ‘Pamela', And The Kiss
The controversy begins during part one-of-three of ‘Pamela'.
Louie arrives home to find the titular character/friend/love-interest/quasi-antagonist asleep on the couch, after babysitting their two daughters. On their way out, Louie attempts to force a kiss, asserting relentless physical power over Pamela despite their repeated protests.
Once they finally wrench themselves from their fumbling — yet undeniably violent — grasp and reaches the apartment's exit, Louie blocks their path and tries to appeal to their sense of reason. They were recently interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with him, they claim, and they know they want to “do things”, but because something's blocking their reciprocation he's going to “take control”. They relent, wincing as they plant one on their non-committal lips, after which they finally get the hell out of there. Louie celebrates personal accomplishment with a deluded double fist-pump.
It's an extremely uncomfortable — and to many, disturbing — scene, but it wasn't merely the physical assault that outraged the internet. It was also the perceived lack of consequences. After a deliberate two-episode detour into Louie's adolescence before parts two and three of ‘Pamela' round out the season, they and Pamela finally begin a relationship, without explicitly addressing the brutality of the moment.
The Backlash
Last week, Claire Lobenfeld of Gawker posted an impassioned piece on the season called ‘When Louie Stopped Being Funny'. It's summed up by their concluding sentence: “What we learn in this season of Louie is that if you press a woman hard enough, they will eventually be romantic with you in the capacity that you want.”
Lobenfeld's argument rests on their reading of the scene as an ‘attempted rape'. Anita Li of mashable.com agrees: “Where are the consequences? Even though Pamela has toyed with Louie's feelings, the consequences of their attempted rape should have been clear. It would've made more sense — both artistically and morally — to have Pamela dump Louie, or for the two to break up.”
I understand these reactions; it's a painfully disconcerting moment to sit through. But this is Louie, and C.K. could never be accused of being unaware of what he's doing. Their scenes are meticulously constructed, nuanced, layered, and often open to individual interpretation. Until they or their co-writer Pamela Adlon provide comment, my evolving opinion is that this season is not condoning Louie's behaviour, nor is the moment an attempted rape.
The scene was preceded by a bit of stand-up that homes in on one of C.K.'s favourite themes: the inherent stupidity of masculinity. In this bit, C.K. — well-known as a feminist — asserts that women should be the dominant sex, that they're more sensible, and that the only reason history has placed men behind the driver's seat is because they use and abuse force. This is the show's way of explicitly expressing its disdain for male violence against women, before exploring something far less black-and-white: the relationship between these two specific characters, within their specific story.
The Characters And Relationship Of Pamela And Louie
Pamela knows Louie, perhaps better than they know himself. Up until this season, they were more an embodiment of Louie's inner voice than a three-dimensional character. They berate him, casts disparagements on their looks, their insecurities, their wimpiness, but always with playfulness and affection. They laugh at their weaknesses in a similar way that they do at their own, through their stand-up. She's allegedly repulsed by them but thoroughly enjoys their company. They share a love of the crass and the crude. And, most importantly, she's the one person in their life that can see right through him.
Prior to this season, their relationship was mostly painted as a picture of unrequited love, on Louie's side. The only romantic interest from Pamela we'd seen was on a single night in season two, when they hinted they take a bath together – a moment Louie failed to clock until it had passed. At the end of season two, Pamela leaves the country and Louie lets their perceived ‘true love' fade into the fat-folds of theirs mind.
In season four, while Louie is in the midst of a sweet relationship with Amia — a Hungarian woman who doesn't speak a word of English and is soon to return home — Pamela startles them with a literal and metaphorical kick up the ass. They admit how much she's missed him, and — with great difficulty — reveals that she's willing to try a romantic relationship. But Louie is in the throes of their own love story, one that's uncluttered by the need to verbally express feelings, and the last thing they want in that moment is to have their rose-tinted bubble burst by the woman who reminds them of everything they hate about himself.
After Louie and Amia part ways, they belatedly try to take up Pamela's offer only to be told that “the ship has sailed” — in a way that suggests she's (justifiably) reacting out of wounded pride. This is the first moment where Pamela feels like a real character, one who finds not only their feelings for Louie difficult to digest, but romantic feelings themselves.
So here's where that sticky scene comes in. At a character level, Louie's aggressive attempt to kiss Pamela is foolish, fueled by a misguided desire to be the dominant alpha male in order to get them to break down their barriers and admit their true feelings. At a more general level, their actions were horrible, abusive, and just plain wrong, but even Pamela knows this was not a man trying to rape a woman — confirmed in their own words, “this would be rape if you weren't so stupid”. They know the intention behind Louie's hideous behavior: not to abuse a woman into satisfying their own sexual desires, but to wrench an acknowledgement from them – in the most misguided way — that they are interested in him.
In ‘Pamela Part Two', Louie goes about breaking down Pamela's barriers in a completely different way. They ask them out. They insist it's a date. They demonstrate the ability to surprise Pamela with an uncharacteristically commanding charm, one that she's always berated them for lacking. Gawker's Lobenfeld read this as a just-as-sinister version of Louie pressuring Pamela into a romantic situation, but if you watch it again, it wasn't. They enjoyed every moment of their attempt to woo her, and was in a more comfortable space to experience their feelings in the present moment — a pivot-point confirmed by their consensual kiss under a well-timed meteor shower in Central Park.
In Order To Finally Take That Bath…
At the end of this date, in a scene that intentionally mirrors that scene, minus the manhandling, Louie once again questions Pamela's exit: “We're having a romantic time”. But they claim their park-kiss was merely friendly. When Louie gives up and sulks off, Pamela is surprised; they expected the pursuit to continue. They feel an emotional connection to the man, but is unsure if they want them physically — partly because they live in a world where being drawn to an oaf like Louie is embarrassing. They want to stay, but they don't want to feel pressured into physical intimacy. They need to remain in that comfortable space, one that's not dictated by Louie's ideals or expectations.
These are two flawed humans who feel a mutual bond, but are out of sync. They need to accept each other for who they are: Louie is insecure, and earnest, and schlubby; Pamela is provoking, and cynical, and guarded. Louie is not a rapist. Pamela is not mean-spirited. They're never going to be each other's dream partners, but they are an undeniable partnership with the potential for romance, or at least their version of it.
Maybe they have a future together, maybe they don't, but the only way they're every going to move forward is if Louie stops trying to force Pamela to do anything they can't do, or be anyone they can't be, and just lets things happen naturally.

Bring On The Rewatch
This season of Louie has been about communication, and the internal and external forces that cloud our ability to connect with each other. It's also spot-lit the female psyche, and the awful behaviour most women will have to endure at the hands of men at some point in their lives.
I've yet to skirt the surface of the eleven other episodes, but I have a feeling that with some hindsight, my opinions on this will evolve. What I can say is that C.K. and Adlon have displayed a great amount of courage by staring these issues square in the eye; it's confronting to write about, but I'm glad there's a showrunner out there forcing us into this space. The fanboy in me believes it's for the greater good — and that Louie remains a vital, audacious, and undeniably unique televisual force with which to be reckoned.

KALAMAZOO, MI -- More than 2,600 people are expected Tuesday evening as basketball legend and author Kareem Abdul-Jabbar discusses their new book to culminate this year's Reading Together community-wide book reading program.
Abdul-Jabbar is to meet members of the community from 7 to 9 p.m. March 14, at Western Michigan University's Miller Auditorium.
Their book "Writings on the Wall: Searching for a New Equality Beyond Black and White," was chosen as the Reading Together book for 2017 and, as part of that program, has been the subject of organized community discussions in recent weeks.
Abdul-Jabbar will be interviewed for about an hour on stage at Miller Auditorium by Tim Terrentine, vice president for development and alumni relations at WMU. They are expected to discuss the book for about half that time, and Terrentine is then expected to ask some poignant questions about the book and issues that were solicited from members of the community during the community-wide discussions.
Released in the fall with the presidential election in the backdrop, the book has become timely reading. Published by Time, it explores issues that affect Americans today, including race and economic inequality, the media's influence on society and the business of sports.
Abdul-Jabbar, who will be 70 in April, is a member of the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame, a six-time NBA champion (one with the Milwaukee Bucks and five with the Los Angeles Lakers) and widely considered one of the best basketball players of all time. The 7-foot 20-inch center retired in 1989 but remains the NBAs all-time leading scorer. Since then, they have had involvements in business and entertainment and has authored six books for adults and three for children.
Karen Trout, coordinator of Reading Together for the Kalamazoo Public Library, said Abdul-Jabbar will autograph copies of their book in the lobby of Miller Auditorium after the on-stage discussion. Pictures can be taken while they are signing but they will be on a tight schedule and will not stop to stand or pose.
They said they will not sign any sports memorabilia.
Copies of their books, which has only been released in hard copy thus far, will be on sale at Miller Auditorium, care of Michigan News Agency. The books sell for $27.95 each ($29.62 with taxes). Cash and credit cards will be accepted.
There is no charge to attend the gathering but those planning to attend have been asked to RSVP at www.kpl.gov/reading-together/2017/
Miller Auditorium has the capacity to seat about 3,500 people.
Cycling bodies in UK, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany demand cross-Channel train service keep policy of transporting bicycles in one piece
Eurostar has been accused of treating cyclists as “third-class passengers” over a new policy that will force them to dismantle their bikes before using the cross-Channel rail service.
National cycling charity CTC has joined forces with its partners in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany to condemn the regulation, claiming it will discourage new cyclists and those who rely on cycling from using the train and make bus and air travel more attractive.
City cycle commutes around the world – mapped Read more
Currently cyclists can take a complete bicycle and pay a £30 fee for it to be carried via a registered luggage system.
But from next month passengers will be forced to dismantle their bikes, put them into a box and reassemble them when they reach their destination. This is more restrictive than any train operator in the UK.
Eurostar has claimed the change is needed to accommodate other passengers who are travelling with more luggage.
But CTC chief executive Paul Tuohy said: “There is nothing sustainable about this policy, as it actively discourages the people we want to see cycling more from using what is otherwise a fantastic service.
“For the new cyclist or those who rely on cycling as a mobility aid, dismantling and reassembling a bike for transit is too difficult.
“With London, Paris and Brussels each vying to be top cycling cities, and Amsterdam, arguably Europe's cycling capital, due to join the Eurostar network in 2016, now is not the time to take a step back in cycle rail policy.
“Cyclists should not be treated as third-class passengers and we urge Eurostar to reverse their planned policy.”
The European Cyclists' Federation (ECF), which represents cycling bodies across the continent, described the new policy as “extremely inconvenient” in a letter to Eurostar chief executive Nicolas Petrovic.
The ECF added: “We understand that there is a limited space for baggage on the trains but it should be allocated on a first come, first served basis. We would therefore request that the current policy of allowing the carriage of complete bicycles is retained.”
Holiday firm Blue Marble Travel, which organises trips for cyclists using the Eurostar, also criticised the new bike rule.
Its logistics manager, Nicolas Clifford, said: “If Eurostar puts its plans in place the only realistic choice for cyclists seeking to join the type of itinerant trip we offer will be short-haul air, which makes a mockery of the company's green mantra.
“Some will, indeed, fly or drive to the continent. Others will renounce their cycling holidays and choose to motor instead.”
But Eurostar said the new policy would allow it to transport more bikes per train and all “reasonable sized” bike boxes would be accepted.
A spokesperson said: “Passengers with bikes have and continue to be important to us. Our new policy has been introduced so that we can use the space on our trains more flexibly, by carrying the same or more bikes depending on the demand from passengers.
“The only change is that bikes will now need to be carried in a bike box, which we are happy to provide. When packaging bikes in this way they take up less space which means that we can carry more bikes or any other type of luggage.”
But Rosemary Dooley, 68, from Kendal, Cumbria, who recently went to Portugal for a cycle holiday, said: “I have to take my own bike everywhere due to arthritis in my hands – hence small adaptations.
“I am also not mechanical but it seems now that I will have to learn to remove and replace the front wheel. I just hope it doesn't involve strong fingers.”
CTC accused Eurostar of hypocrisy by claiming its new policy did not match its support for sustainable travel.
The charity is urging members of the public concerned about the planned changes to write to the train operator.
A study commissioned by the European parliament in 2012 found that there are 2.3m cycle tourism trips in the EU every year.
The CIA used Briar Woods High School in Loudoun County, Va., for training exercises during spring break, and acknowledged Thursday it inadvertently left explosive material in the engine compartment of a school bus. Photo courtesy of Briar Woods High School
LEESBURG , Va., April 1 (UPI) -- The CIA admitted that after a training exercise it left "explosive training material" aboard a Virginia school bus later used by elementary and high school students.
The Loudoun County, Va., Sheriff's Office and the CIA, in separate statements Thursday, acknowledged the school buses were used during spring break in training scenarios at Briar Woods High School. The CIA statement indicated the exercises involved explosives-sniffing dogs.
A container of "explosive training material," described by Loudon school spokesperson Wayde Byard as a soft, putty-type explosive, appropriate for battlefield demolition and stable unless a detonator is inserted, was found in the engine compartment of a school bus during routine maintenance after students returned to classes.
The container was found nearly a week after the CIA exercises concluded on March 24. The bus was in use by students for two days, Monday and Tuesday, and carried dozens of elementary and high school students on {link:eight trips totaling 145 miles. : "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/04/01/feds-left-explosives-material-aboard-school-bus-after-training-exercises-parents-told.html?intcmp=hplnws" target="_blank"}
"During the exercise, explosive training material was inadvertently left by the CIA K-9 unit in one of the buses used in the exercise," the CIA statement said, adding the materials did not pose a danger to anyone riding the bus.
A meeting Thursday of school and law enforcement officials, including CIA representatives, determined training exercises would be postponed until stronger safety protocols are established.
"We're all very upset by what happened, but we're going to review everything that did happen. Obviously we're concerned. The CIA really expressed its deep concern and regret today, and it was sincere," Byard said.
Standing in a reconstructed frontier fort on a cold and clear Tuesday morning, Bernie Sanders is promising a revolution. He'll bring in universal health care, make university tuition free and slam the (hammer) of the federal government down on Wall Street.
"We've got a handful of financial institutions that have so much economic and political power," the senator from Vermont and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination declares, their Brooklyn-accented baritone echoing off the rafters to the rapt audience below. "We've got to break them up."
With less than two weeks to go before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses – the first electoral test of the U.S. presidential election – Mr. Sanders has good reason to be fired up.

Once dismissed as a flash-in-the-pan long shot, the messy-haired 74-year-old has run a surprisingly durable campaign and has a real shot at embarrassing Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner. One poll by the Des Moines Register last week showed the pair in a statistical tie in Iowa.
Losing the first contest of the race to Mr. Sanders would be a bad omen for a candidate as strong as Ms. Clinton, as well as a window into the divisions within the party.
The reasons for Mr. Sanders's rise, as explained by the Iowans who crowded into the Fort Museum on the edge of this farming and industry town of 25,000, range from their ambitious policy promises to their populist admonitions of capitalist greed to antipathy toward Ms. Clinton. The most-cited factor is the authenticity of the candidate himself.
Rusty Gregerson, a 45-year-old recycling-plant worker, points to the senator's penchant for riding public transit and flying coach as central to their appeal. The father of a 17-year-old daughter who's starting university next year, Mr. Gregerson also appreciates Mr. Sanders's promise of free tuition.
"It's just cool to see someone in that position who cares about us," Mr. Gregerson says. "Everything they say is genuine."
Key to Mr. Sanders's strength has been their popularity with younger voters.
Mia Dorothy, a 24-year-old insurance salesperson, says they have never before gone to a political rally but was attracted by Mr. Sanders's health-care proposals. "I think he's got a real shot. For the first time in my life, it's a candidate I actually believe in," they say.

To Mr. Sanders's supporters, Ms. Clinton is emblematic of the political establishment – happy to take donations from big banks and prone to compromising on progressive ideals.
"Bernie's authentic – he's stood on the same issues for 40 years – and Hillary seems to jump back and forth," says Samantha McMahon, a 25-year-old restaurant manager, who professed bafflement that Ms. Clinton, despite their own attempts at launching universal health care in the 1990s, opposed Mr. Sanders's promise in Sunday's Democratic debate to create a publicly funded health-insurance system.
"It was kind of funny that Hillary Clinton, who has been fighting for health care, didn't agree with Bernie," Ms. McMahon says.
Mr. Sanders's critics in the Democratic Party reply that their ideas, while they might be popular with the base, are simply not achievable in a gridlocked Congress and amid political polarization in Washington.
Ms. Clinton hinted at this on Sunday, when they described government-funded health care as a "contentious debate" they did not want to reopen.
At the Fort Dodge town hall, retired teacher Jane Nettleton, 72, points out to Mr. Sanders that they sat on the Senate committee that helped craft Obamacare and ultimately decided that full-fledged universal health-care would be impossible to get through.

"Single-payer was not going to survive, so you went with the Affordable Care Act," they say. "How do you get these things passed?"
Mr. Sanders replies that their supporters have to keep the pressure on Congressional Republicans to change their minds. "This is what I mean when I talk about political revolution," they say. "The only way we get real change in America is when millions of people stand up and demand it."
Afterward, Ms. Nettleton says they think Ms. Clinton's practical incrementalism is a better bet: "We need more of a pragmatist, not an idealist," they say.
Mr. Sanders's campaign may very well be a quixotic quest. Despite their strong numbers in Iowa, they are still far behind nationally; a Monmouth University poll this week pegged Ms. Clinton at 52-per-cent support among Democratic voters, compared to 37 per cent for Mr. Sanders.
Dennis Goldford, a political science professor at Drake University in Des Moines, attributes Mr. Sanders's relative strength in Iowa to the state's overwhelmingly white demographic: Mr. Sanders's focus on economic issues has resonated with white working-class voters, but they have been weak on race and gender, while Ms. Clinton commands more support with African-Americans.
"He's an unreconstructed New Dealer, who just wants a stronger social-safety net than the Democratic Party has [advocated] over the last 25 years. They appeal to the Democratic id," Prof. Goldford says. "He's a bit of a one-note samba. They don't talk about identity politics or gender politics as comfortably as Hillary Clinton does."

Still, a Sanders victory in Iowa, even if Ms. Clinton ultimately wins the nomination, would be "a warning sign" to them that they have to do more to speak to Americans' economic concerns and appeal to white working-class voters, Prof. Goldford says.
For their part, Mr. Sanders is eager to remind their audience that, a year ago, no one even thought they would get this far.
"When I began the campaign, they said … 'Secretary Clinton is the inevitable candidate of the Democratic Party. You might be able to raise some good issues, but you can't win,'" they say. "Well, today the inevitable candidate does not look so inevitable."
Texas is in need of some immediate help up front and could get that in the form of a graduate transfer.
Former Michigan offensive tackle Logan Tuley-Tillman plans to make a visit to Texas on January 21 and is interested in the Longhorns.
"Texas is a big-time program, and I am highly interested," Tuley-Tillman told Horns247. "I remember watching Vince Young vs. USC in the Rose Bowl as a kid.
"I committed to Michigan early on in high school and never took my visit there. I look forward to seeing campus and meeting the coaches."
Tuley-Tillman was dismissed from Michigan in September for ‘conduct unacceptable for a Michigan athlete.'
The 6-foot-7, 330-pounder was a four-star prospect out of Manual (IL) in the 2013 class. They picked Michigan over offers from Ole Miss, USC, Texas A&M and others.
Tuley-Tillman will make an official visit to Houston on January 22.
Tuley-Tillman has two years remaining of eligibility remaining.

A new Holocaust memorial and education centre in central London is to receive £50m from the government.
The announcement came as commemorative events were held in Britain on Holocaust Memorial Day. The Queen said it was a time to "remember all those affected".
Politicians and religious leaders joined some UK-based survivors for a service in Central Hall, Westminster.
It marked 70 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp.
In a message to mark the anniversary, the Queen referred to "those who died, those who have rebuilt their lives in Britain, and the rescuers and liberators who took great risks to assist and save their fellow human beings".
About 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed at the camp between 1940 and 1945.
Auschwitz-Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army of the Soviet Union on 27 January 1945. It opened as a museum in 1947.
Other events in the UK included:
Auschwitz survivors lighting candles at a ceremony at the Imperial War Museum in London
Seventy candles lit at York Minster, one for every year since the liberation
A Holocaust Memorial Day service at Ayr Town Hall, attended by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon
An address by Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones at Cardiff City Hall to honour victims and their families
Annual wreath-laying at Lowestoft railway station in Suffolk, where around 200 Jewish evacuee children arrived in 1938.
'Energy and commitment'
In a message in the official programme of commemorative events, the Queen said: "Many refugees and survivors of the camps and ghettoes found a home in the United Kingdom and have given us their energy and commitment.

The UK memorial and education centre was recommended in a report by the cross-party Holocaust Commission.
It will be a "world-class" education and learning centre to maintain awareness for generations to come of "the darkest hour of human history", Prime Minister David Cameron said at the Westminster event.
Some of the government's £50 million funding will go towards the construction of the "striking and prominent" monument and an endowment fund to secure the long-term future of Holocaust education.
'Extraordinary' survivors
After announcing the funding in the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne told MPs: "We will go on funding the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which takes MPs and many, many school children to Auschwitz to see for themselves the horror that happened there.
"I think across the House we can come together to commemorate this day but also to make sure it is never forgotten... and we never repeat its mistakes."
Addressing the Westminster event, attended by the Prince of Wales and many public figures, Mr Cameron said it was "time for Britain as a nation to stand together and say 'we will remember'.
"We will teach every generation the British values of respect and tolerance that we hold dear.
"And we will ensure that they can learn from the stories of our Holocaust survivors long after we have all gone."

Prince Charles said the Holocaust must always be remembered and all its victims honoured as it was "an act of evil unique in history".
"Details of the Nazis' diabolical enterprise can help future generations, wherever they may be, understand not just what happened across Europe, but how this came to happen."
Among the invited audience were Holocaust survivors and their families, Labour leader Ed Miliband, Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis.
Mr Miliband, whose grandfather died in one of the Nazi death camps, said: "It's an emotional day for people who have memories and families involved in this.
"When there's prejudice around the world and we see a rise in anti-Semitism, it's incredibly important that we keep that memory alive."
There were speeches, readings and musical performances from contributors including cellist Simon Wallfisch - grandson of 89-year-old Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, a surviving member of the women's orchestra in Auschwitz.
Six candles designed by sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor were lit by five Holocaust survivors and a survivor from the Bosnian war.
Auschwitz-Birkenau - a network of several forced labour and extermination camps - is the best known of all Nazi camps.

Down Syndrome - A Christian Neurodevelopmental Approach
The first purpose of this paper is to give you hope for a bright future for your child with Down Syndrome. A diagnosis of Down Syndrome typically comes with specific lists of what to expect and what the future holds. Don't believe them.
What the future holds is not something that is predetermined or preset. Future abilities are based upon the opportunities that are presented to the individual specific to their needs. Far too often, learning opportunities are not given to a child when the diagnosis gives such dismal predictions. As the parent or relative of a child with Down Syndrome, you have already heard the negatives: slow development, language impairment, mental retardation and possible health problems. You know that the cause is a genetic anomaly, either trisomy 21, translocation or mosaicism. You have been recommended to put the child in special services with early intervention. You have been told to lower your expectations for this precious child. You do not have to settle for this dismal future vision for your child. With the proper intervention, the future can be very bright and promising for your child.
Nothing in creation can compare to the amazing capacity and adaptability of the human brain. Traditional thinking has believed that there are limits to the brain's capacity. Research into neural plasticity of the brain (the brain's ability to change and adapt) is greatly changing how we work with individuals with injuries, learning inefficiencies, sensory problems and genetic syndromes. While traditional thinking is catching up with the concept of neural plasticity, it is something that neurodevelopmentalists have been working with since its pioneering days in the 1940's.
METABOLIC ISSUES
The extra 21st chromosome causes metabolic imbalances, which result in many of the characteristics associated with Down Syndrome. Without intervention, it can be looked on as an anomaly with a degenerative process. The good news is that with specific metabolic and nutritional intervention, this cycle of degeneration can be broken and more normal growth and function can be achieved. Addressing the nutritional and metabolic needs of the child with Down Syndrome is critically important in helping the child grow and develop normally. The effects can be profound and should be investigated as soon as possible.
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL ISSUES
Often, expectations for children with Down syndrome are lowered and therefore they are not offered opportunities for normal development, both mentally and physically. Typically, learning is slowed down in order for the child to be able to develop at their own pace. Also, children with problems are put into a specialized setting with other children with major learning and physical challenges. Experience has shown that the reverse should be happening. Using an accelerated, specific stimulation program, great progress can be achieved. Because of the brain's neuroplasticity, function determines structure. How one uses their brain actually changes its physical structure. With a specific stimulation program in a normal environment, normal structure (mental and physical function) can emerge. It is impossible to achieve normal development in an abnormal environment. Children should live, learn and work in a normal environment.
MOTOR DEVELOPMENT
One of the first and most important issues that must be addressed with a child with Down Syndrome is that of low muscle tone. This can be seen in the child with floppy joints, slow development in mobility (crawling, creeping and walking) and generally weak muscles. It is important that the proper developmental steps are followed and at the appropriate time. It is often tempting to have a child sit up before the child is able to put themselves in and out of that position. Until a child is able to do so, they are not developmentally ready to sit. They have not developed the muscle tone necessary for properly supporting their spine. Putting a child in a standing position prematurely can cause hyperextension of the knees and other structural concerns. Both activities, done prematurely, will limit the appropriate developmental activities the child should be doing, such as developing a cross pattern crawl and creep down on the floor. With appropriate stimulation, weak areas can be improved and corrected and normal structure and function can be achieved.
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROBLEMS
Breathing problems, especially congestion and mouth breathing are a common concern of children with Down Syndrome. Mouth breathing is very inefficient and shallow breathing and does not develop proper sinus structure, does not get as much oxygen to the body, especially the brain (a baby's brain uses about 50% of the oxygen taken in, so it is very important). Mouth breathing also desensitizes and thickens the tongue, resulting in oral motor problems with speech and eating. Often, mouth tactility in a child with Down syndrome is low, and special attention must be paid to stimulating the mouth, tongue and lips. Attention should be paid to how well the child chews and whether they have a normal sense of taste and smell. All of these issues can be addressed with proper stimulation and therapy to normalize function and structure.
Because of the tendency toward congestion, special attention should be paid to the hearing. Chronic congestion may result in fluid in the ears that can severely retard development of the auditory pathways to the brain. If a child cannot hear well, a child cannot develop good speech. The vestibular system (the system of balance) is also part of the inner ear structure. Fluid in the inner ear can also delay mobility. Because a child with Down Syndrome may have a high pain tolerance, that child may have an ear infection or fluid in the ears without the parent being aware of it, because the child does not feel the pain appropriately. So, it is important to have the ears checked regularly for fluid with a simple test called a tympanogram. If fluid is present, it is recommended that it be aggressively treated. Tubes are often needed to keep the ears clear.
Little children are "wired" to learn language and the child with Down syndrome is no different. Neurodevelopmentalists do not recommend teaching the young child with Down syndrome sign language. The reason for this is that the child will learn to sign very, very well. And if a child can sign very well, then that child will not need to talk to communicate. If it is hard for the child to talk because of congestion and hearing problems or oral motor problems, and it is easy for the child to sign to get what they want, guess what the child will do? The child will sign and not talk. Neurodevelopmentalists seek to achieve normal function. Having to undo the teaching of sign language is frustrating parents trying to get the little children to talk. Parents whose children have been taught to sign have had to go through long periods of time ignoring the signs and demanding language in order to shift the mode of communication the child uses. Better to not start on that path in the first place.
How a child processes information auditorily will be a direct reflection of the amount of language a child acquires and uses. Auditory sequential processing is the ability to hold pieces of information in short term memory. Auditory tonal processing is the ability of the brain to correctly process tones. There needs to be good, clear auditory input of specific quality and interest to develop these processing abilities and good language.
ACADEMICS
One of the greatest delights of this work is seeing children defy labels. Knowing how to teach academic material in a developmentally appropriate fashion has helped children with Down Syndrome learn to read and do mathematics and do them well. The child's strengths and weaknesses must be assessed and an individualized learning program is the most efficient way to help each individual learn at the fastest rate.
SENSORY ISSUES
A child with Down syndrome can have a wide range of problems with sensory issues. Often a child will have many different tactility issues. The skin surface can be too sensitive or not sensitive enough.
The deep sensors may not sense pain appropriately. The child may not sense temperature appropriately. These tactility issues may vary on different parts of the body, such as, hands may be too sensitive, the face and head may have low sensitivity and so forth. Each child must be assessed individually to design an appropriate stimulation program to remediate any problem areas.
Many children have vision problems. The visual system of the young child is very plastic and changeable. Looking at the developmental levels of vision and providing appropriate stimulation opportunities for normal function is preferable to resorting to artificial means of vision enhancement. It is preferable to try to achieve normal vision and convergence (the ability of the eyes to work together) before the looking at artificial means of glasses or surgical intervention.
Problems are sometimes seen with eye contact and central detail vision. Sadly, some children with Down syndrome are getting an additional label of autistic or "autistic-like" symptoms. This is a symptomatic label simply describing an individual with many sensory dysfunction issues. By treating the root cause of the problems rather than treating the symptoms, sensory dysfunction can be improved and often resolved with appropriate stimulation.
CONCLUSION
Though your child was born with Down Syndrome, there is much joy and hope. The future can be bright and the parents need to be supported and equipped with information and techniques to help their child reach their full potential. With knowledge and information appropriate to their child, parents can have the joy of helping their child defy labels and achieve their full, God-given potential.

A few days ago, the internet cried collective tears of joy when video of Kathy Beitz holding their infant son went viral. Mothers and babies are adorable, yes, but Beitz's case is special. Like, she's-legally-blind-and-has-never-seen-a-baby-before special.
Beitz, 29, who lives about two hours away from Toronto, told ABC News they suffer from a kind of macular degeneration called Stargardt. Though they are not completely blind, they have a blind spot in the center of their vision, they said. They looked at their baby through specialty glasses called eSight Eyewear.
The glasses cost $15,000 and are not covered by insurance, but Beitz received them thanks to eSight's fundraising program, said Taylor West, eSight's outreach director. They said the glasses, which are registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, work by capturing real-time video and enhancing it for the legally blind to see. About 140 people have eSight glasses in North America, West said. (Via ABC News)
A portion of an NWR interview with Executive Producer Ryogo Tsujimoto...
NWR: Are we going to see any significant differences between the western and eastern releases?
Tsujimoto: The fundamental game is the same. Think of Monster Hunter 4G versus Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, we want to bring that full experience to players in the west. One thing that has to change is that for licensing and rights reasons certain collaboration dlc items that we have got in the japanese version we're just unable to bring them over to the west. But of course we wouldn't want to just cut content and leave western players hanging with a less complete game so we've actually taken the time to create some exclusive new collaboration dlc only appearing in the western version of Monster Hunter Generations so even japanese players won't have their hands on this stuff. We've already announced Fire Emblem crossover equipment, we have the Okami wolf costume for the prowlers, for the cats. we also announced ghosts and goblins crossover content and we have even got further unannounced collaboration dlc that we're gonna be announcing in the coming months, so stay tuned for more news on that.
In a very exciting turn of events for fans of Neil Gaiman's “Sandman,” it seems that yesterday's reports of the television series' development delay are not entirely accurate. Comic book author and DC Comics Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns has just Tweeted that the series is, indeed, moving forward and, best of all, he'll be working alongside Gaiman to bring Dream to the small screen.
“Correction to world,” Johns says, “The Sandman is AWAKE! 🙂 Psyched to be working with [Neil] on developing one of the greatest series ever!”
They then adds:
“Sandman in any form – comics to live action – doesn't work without [Neil]”
Speculation suggests that Eric Kripke's comments yesterday indicate that they are no longer involved with the project's development and, while fans may be dismayed by the “Supernatural” creator's theoretical departure, having Gaiman on board is surely a creative coup for all involved.
Sandman, which launched DC Comic's Vertigo imprint, ran for 75 issues beginning in 1989. Gaiman's worlds-within-worlds weaved an episodic anthology, focusing on the allegorical character of Dream and their brothers and sisters, known as the Endless (Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium, Destruction and Destiny).
Confirmation and additional information should be available shortly, but, in the meantime, “Sandman” fans should start getting excited.
That is one of the key questions you should all be asking the Trump Administration as they sort through the millions of refugees to find those they will admit to America. (Trump says their Admin. will admit a whopping 50,000 this year!)
Nayla Rush, writing at the Center for Immigration Studies asks, how is the UNHCR picking the “lucky few?”
98.6% of the Syrians entering the US now are Muslims
In the case of the Syrians, in FY15, FY16, and 5 months in to FY17 we admitted a total of 19,826 Syrians to the US. 19,562 are Muslims, mostly Sunnis. That means that 98.6% were Syrian Muslims (via Wrapsnet). Why so few Christians?
Here is Rush at CIS:
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) recently shared on its website the story of a Syrian refugee family who was resettled from Jordan to Dallas. The 30-year-old mechanic, Firas al Ahmad, their wife Samira and their three children fled to Jordan at the end of 2013 when the fighting intensified near their home. The family struggled there for over three years due to the “lack of legal work opportunities” and welcomed UNHCR's offer to resettle in the United States. Once their application approved, they sold their furniture and moved out from their apartment to stay with Firas' dad in the Jordanian city of Irbid.
The family is filmed there the day before departure. Firas explained on camera: “I'm leaving because of my kids, for their future. I hope they can get a good education, and have a better life than the one we had … The hardest thing is leaving family members behind. All of them but especially my father.” (Firas's brothers, aunt, and father left Syria with them.)
Samira too was emotional: “Syria is everything. They say, a nation is like a mother. What's our worth without our mother?” They then burst in tears. Firas reiterated: “Syria is everything, it is everything to me. The minute the war is over I will go back. Even now I wish it would end today, before we leave, so that we could go home.”
In the text, UNHCR underlined the following: “Resettlement programmes in the United States and other developed countries are designed to offer a lifeline to the most vulnerable refugees, including children at risk, survivors of torture and those with medical needs.”(Emphasis added)
How does this apply to Al-Ahmad's family? As far as we can tell they do not seem to suffer from any specific vulnerability. By their own admission, they fled Syria because the fighting was getting closer; and they accepted the resettlement offer to give a better life to their children, not because they could not stay in Jordan.
As a reminder, the refugee resettlement program was set up to provide “resettlement to a third country in situations where it is impossible for a person to go back home or remain in the host country.” (Emphasis added.) Also, resettlement is one of UNHCR's “durable solutions” – resettled refugees in the U.S. are required by law to apply for a green card (permanent residence) in the United States one year after arrival. They can apply for U.S. citizenship five years from entry.
But does the Al-Ahmad family want to stay in the U.S.? Do they wish to become American citizens, or is their loyalty first and foremost to Syria? If their true will is to go back home “the minute the war is over,” why resettle them in the U.S. to begin with?
Rush provides more cases, continue reading here.
It is not about humanitarianism!
I can answer the question about why we are permanently placing Syrian refugees (who would prefer to go home) in to your towns and cities—three reasons (have sympathy for these Syrians being used as pawns!):
~The resettlement contractors are paid by the head to drop off refugees who are essentially paying clients and they want to keep their little federally-funded fiefdoms going.
~The Libs want reliable Democrat voters (especially in red states!).
~The UNHCR is working day and night to erase borders and dilute Christian nations with Muslim migrants.
I don't think the Syrians are going to make good meatpacking workers (cheap laborers), so I won't list that as a reason in this case (for Somalis, Burmese yes, for Syrians probably not).
If the Trump Administration is at all serious about reforming the UN/US Refugee Admissions Program they would get the UN out of our immigration decisions and stop funding the so-called ‘religious' (politically liberal) charities doing the resettling.
Of course, this story makes the argument for the Trump “safe zones” concept!
Recap: We got kidnapped and trapped inside Team Asgard's Secret Base. Then we got out.
Our next mission is to go to Mt. Press to stop Team Asgard because they are dangerous people.
Before that, Saga asks the Police Club if they need a new member. Conveniently, they do, and it just-so-happens that an evil organization called Team Rocket is doing something bad that we need to put an end to.
Sounds like Asgard is helping Rocket out. Do we know what they are actually doing, or are we just going to ruin their day by accusing them of evil deeds?
Well we're gonna go through anyway.
Foxxy gets a level up while battling these two bafoons.
Foxxy is evolving?!
NO NO NO NO NO
CANCEL CANCEL CANCEL
YOU'RE GONNA BE A LEAFEON, DAMNIT
Whew. Thank goodness.
Here is where I realize that Foxxy is level 43 right now. By the time I figure out how to get a Leafeon, who knows what level he'll be at? I'm assuming it will be a high one, which means they probably won't get to learn any new moves as a Leafeon by leveling up.
And yet, I'm gonna wait it out anyway.
Foxxy reaches level 44…
…and we have to crush their dreams again.
Dude. Leafeon. Leafeon. Stop trying to evolve into an Umbreon.
At the end of the area, we see Team Rocket talking to Asgard about Mew. Hm. Guess they were doing something suspicious.
Asgard: Agreed. As long as Team Rocket gives us a copy of whatever they create with it.
Rocket: Consider it done.
???: Not so fast!
Rocket: You can arrest us, but the deal has still been made! There's no stopping us now!
Cop: Tough talk from a future prisoner!
The cop runs up to the two grunts and they disappear. I guess that means they went to jail…?
Cop: prevented any future dealings between Team Rocket and Asgard. Unfortunately, the deal they've already made is sealed. We need to find out what Rocket intends to make and how to stop them. Take this as a reward!
They give Saga a Max Revive, which is always helpful in this game.
We didn't get enough information about Team Rocket from that mission, so we're gonna power through the next one.
We're in Pallet Town!? Awesome!
Grunt: get hurt!
We did some battles, leveled some Pokémon, cancelled some evolutions, yadda yadda yadda. This is the scene when we walked into Professor Oak's lab.
Oak: I would never hand it to ruffian scum like you! Police!
Grunt: Coppers can't help you now! Quickly, get the machine! *walks up offscreen, returns* Let's scram!
Slow down, Professor Oak! You know me! I'm Aria's daughter, remember? Gonna save the world and whatnot?
What is the shit?! Oak wants to battle?!
Some screwed-up version of Tangela comes in and Xion ends them with a critical hit of Return. Oak then sends in a strange… very strange version of Lickitung…
I get they're evolutions, but… they don't look a whole lot different from the other Pokémon. All that happened was they got really fat upon evolving.
Xion finally remembers that they can shed their own skin and decides to go ahead and cure themselves of their paralysis. We waste a Super Potion and a Soda Pop on them so they can hopefully stay alive long enough to collect the experience points from this thing.
They do eventually, after much heal-spam.
Blastoise is Oak's next Pokémon, so I thought, “Hey, Yukio still has Grass Knot! This could be a OHKO!” I send the little guy out and the giant turtle confuses them with a Water Pulse. Yukio then proceeds to hurt themselves repeatedly.
Seriously, dude, one Grass Knot could probably knock them out.
Oh. I see how it is. Fainting yourself is more appealing than taking down this big-ass guy. Whatever. Just tried to give you a few moments in the spotlight.
If Yukio doesn't want the glory of one-shotting Blastoise, then I'll give it to Barret.
They even level up to 51. That could have been your experience, Yukio, but you chose to faint instead.
Zephyr takes on Charizard.
The hell is this thing??
We end the match with a type-advantage.
Oak: Rocket Grunts! Please, accept my apology!
REALLY Oak? Did you REALLY think I was a Rocket Grunt? REALLY?
Oak: It's a shame Team Rocket got the machine they wanted… I just can't understand why they would need a set of armor for harnessing Psychic potential!
Why did you have a set of armor for harnessing Psychic potential?
Oak: There isn't even a Pokémon that fits it! Thanks for helping, anyways. I'm sure your superiors would have been very proud of you. Take this as a reward! *gives Ultra Balls*
With that mission over with, I head to the Move Deleter to get rid of all the HM's I've taught to my Pokémon that I have substitute items for.
Then I decide to help the Police guys out one more time.
Giovanni wants to capture Mew on Faraway Island and it is up to us to prevent that from happening. I would very much like to prevent it. I don't want more than one evil-doing team to have legendaries.
Giovanni: for my grunts and for Team Asgard as well.
We skipped the grunt-battling to get to the good part. You'll be happy to know we destroyed all of them.
Giovanni: Your pestering is about to end forever! If that Grunt couldn't beat you, I'll have to!
Which grunt? None of them could beat me.
I'm sure you're waiting for Mt. Press, so I'll just summarize this quickly.
First fight: Rhyperior vs Zephyr. Zephyr kicked ass.
Second fight: Golem vs Zephyr. Zephyr leveled up to 47.
Third fight: Nidoking vs Zephyr. OHKO.
Fourth fight: Nidoqueen vs Zephyr. Another OHKO.
The battle really wasn't that eventful. Psychic kitty-cat had no fear.
I didn't do anything. Mew was smart enough to get the hell out of here while you were distracted.
Giovanni then says that I failed because they managed to swipe some of Mew's DNA anyway. I'd like to know how that happened. You were eight feet away from each other. Did a strand of fur happen to blow by you which you then managed to catch?
The Police show up and tell Saga not to blame themselves for Rocket getting away.
I didn't blame myself. Are you implying I should be feeling bad?
I did attempt the next mission for the Police Club, but wound up losing during the last battle. I tried it again eventually, but for now, Saga is done with the Police.
Okay, time for Mt. Press! Yukio is prepared!
Good thing Twitch Plays Pokémon isn't doing this game.
This sign here is explaining the benefit of owning a Master Ball.
Foreshadowing a legendary Pokémon is in here, perhaps?
Mt. Press is KICKING MY ASS.
The wilds are tough and the trainers are even tougher. I had an Eevee knock out half of my team at one point. Hear that, Foxxy? Eevee's can actually be pretty strong and useful.
It is a pretty good place to level up right now, the only problem is I have to be able to survive the entire battle in order for that to happen, and usually it doesn't.
Do you have any idea how often Yukio had to FLY us out of this place to get to a damn PokeCenter?
Of course, we then had to climb Mt. Press all over again each time.
Hey, look, there are balloon-ducks here!
They're actually really great to train on since Dark and Ghost are super effective against them.
Oh my god, this is hysterical. This is what happens when you use the dolly to move boulders.
If this game knew me in real life, it would know I have absolutely zero strength. Seeing “Saga's strength made it possible” really made me laugh.
Aaaaaand we have a problem.
The Instant Lapras is the substitute for SURF, but I don't have one for WATERFALL yet.
Do you know what this means??
Fish is back in town.
Foxxy is going to be boxed temporarily to make room for Caerwyn to use WATERFALL. Assuming there is no PC in Mt. Press, this means he'll be missing out on the entire run.
Maybe if you didn't faint all of the time STILL, at level 47, you wouldn't be boxed right now.
*sigh*
OH MY GOD, YES! HELL YES!
Now we don't have to FLY and then climb back up every time Saga's team is down!
This is to confirm that yes, sometimes I do actually play during the daytime.
THIS THING.
What IS this thing?
They have a move that actually heals the enemy, they give out a shit-load of experience points, and she's cute to top it all off.
I have seen loads of these in the wild during the daytime in Mt. Press and I am so confused. What is the purpose of having moves that actually benefit your opponent? Are they something special? Is there some super secret strategy to raising one?
I've hyped myself up too much and now I have to own one.
They have the letter “D” for their name, so I go with Daena. If you've ever played Legend of Mana, one of the characters has that name.
Oh look, it's snowing up here!
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I HATE THIS THING?
The only reason I hate it is because it is CREEPY AS FUCK.
What the hell is it supposed to be?! It looks like a fetus in a jelly monster or something. I am so weirded out by it. I honestly get chills up my spine when I see it because I don't understand what it's supposed to be.
I think it's really weird there is this rock that brings up text when you touch it. I was expecting it to heal me or something but it didn't. I wonder what this is for?
I choked while laughing when I read this line. This is the most truthful, believable statement ever said by a grunt ever in any Pokémon game.
Now we know for sure Team Asgard is here, and I start to get nervous. We are constantly climbing back down to Nurse Joy to heal up, so I know my team isn't really all that stable right now… and of course Caerwyn is taking up a slot in my party and is completely useless.
I am afraid of what is waiting for me at the top of this mountain.

Newgrounds provides visitor-driven voting and ranking of user-generated submissions.[2] The site's founder and owner, Thomas "Tom" Fulp, founded the site and company in 1995 and produces in-house content over at the headquarters and offices, based in the Glenside neighborhood of Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania.[3] Newgrounds's slogan since 2006 is "Everything, By Everyone".[4][5] This phrase is a registered trademark that is owned by Thomas Fulp, who first filed it in November 16, 2005.[6][7] Newgrounds's previous slogan from 1995 to 2006 was "The Problems Of The Future, Today!"[citation needed] Contents
Layout and overview Edit
Content and general Edit User-generated content can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site's four web portals: Games, Movies, Audio, and Art. A submission entered undergoes the process termed the Blam-And-Protect system, where it can be critiqued and rated from other users (up to 5 stars) or reviewed by users. Total scores succeeding judgement determine if whether the content will "saved" (added onto the database) or "blammed" (deleted but still saved as per Obituaries section). Art and audio composition is categorized in a relatively different method called "Scouting". Alike the Blam-And-Protect system, it filters out stolen content, spam, or prohibited material online via users and site moderators (referred to as "Mods"). When an individual is scouted, its submitted property becomes virtually visible to everyone else, and then given the privilege to also scout authors. Submissions are organized in the general "Portal", where it accompanies the genres into a single place to view authored material. It also stores throwback content in earlier years, statuses of judged submissions, and current and past daily winners on display. Content and context are liable to be reported for review to the Mods and staff members by flagging it for plausible violations to the site's guidelines, if regarded by multiple users. The homepage of Newgrounds includes featured submissions from each category, as well online awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site's requirements to earn it.[8] Adult-oriented content is general in nature of the site, but restricted only to users ages 18 and up though no safeguard is subject to assure this. Online competitions and contests are open at some times, where an individual can win and receive prizes presented by either a recognized user or staff member upon following a given theme. User communication and behavior Edit The site includes a Community portal, where users are able to communicate with others through various Internet forums. Such forums can be locked if it is in violation. Another communication system developed on the site, termed "Private Messaging" and abbreviated as PM, is also granted, similar to the service of email where users can send messages via other users. A live chat room is also available.
History Edit
1990s: organization Edit In 1991, at the age 13, Tom Fulp launched a Neo Geo fanzine under the name "New Ground" sending issues to approximately 100 members of a club originating on the internet in Prodigy.[9] Fulp launched a website as New Ground Remix using a hosting service, increasing popularity in the summer of 1996 after BBS games Club a Seal[10] and Assassin were created by Fulp while a student at Drexel University, Pennsylvania. Fulp created the sequels to their creations, as games Club a Seal II and Assassin II," along with the decision to develop a separate hosting site, titled as New Ground Atomix.[11] Fulp began experimenting with Macromedia Flash, along with programming a Flash-compatible homepage that was later introduced to their secondary site, "Telebubby Fun Land", and was later released. Fulp later merged their two websites to form another website with the name Newgrounds, leading to them to change hosts to accommodate the increasing traffic, and started selling merchandise to pay for the website's hosting bills. Introducing banner ads to pay for growing payments in 1999, Fulp partnered with Troma, who hosted the site in exchange for a share of ad revenue. A chat room and message board was added onto the website, which allowed people visiting the website to interact with each other. Many users had begun submitting their own Flash creations to Fulp, in which they decided in a portion of the site called "The Portal." A friend of Fulp named Ross developed the “Grounds Gold System”, which allowed users to gain points for visiting the site and voting submissions online. Ad revenue had increased, so Ross was hired, starting development of an current automated Portal, which would allow users to submit their own generated content to the website. 2000s: developments Edit After the dot-com bubble collapsed, Newgrounds struggled in paying its hosting costs. The affiliation with Troma ended in 2003 and Newgrounds switched to another bandwidth provider, which significantly reduced hosting costs. 2004 saw Newgrounds recovering from the online market crash, and the Numa Numa Dance viral phenomenon made its debut on Newgrounds near the end of the year, and became one of the first viral videos on the internet. Medals, the equivalent of in-game achievements, were introduced for the first time through the API software in 2009, soon followed by a "Sharing" component that would allow content to be distributed within games, such as custom level designs. The Art Portal in its complete form was launched in June of the same year, along with the renovation of the company's headquarters. 2010s: improvements Edit In 2011, the Newgrounds Annual Tournament of Animation (NATA) began as a 4–6 month long animation competition on Newgrounds sponsored by Adobe. In 2012, Newgrounds published their first mobile game, titled GroundCats, on iOS. That same year, major changes to the website included the launch of the video player, allowing users to publish movies that were not in .SWF format for the first time, and support for HTML5-coded games, which meant users were no longer limited to submitting movies and games made in Flash. In 2013, the site suffered heavily through financial issues and closed down its online market following the year after. Platform mobile game Geometry Dash developed by RobTop Games allowed songs from Newgrounds to be used in levels made with the level editor with the release of its 1.9 update in 2014. The Audio Portal consisted of submitted copyrighted songs for use in the game, leading to nightcore, along with mashups, banned as a result. A similar issue of copyrighted concurred in 2016, when the site began receiving complaints that old content and files contained unlicensed commercial music and images, resulting in several submissions being removed by moderators and staff. In 2018, new servers and video-encoding-software were unveiled, along with developments for the site to be ad-free, and improve page performance. In November and December 2018, Newgrounds experienced surges of new members originally from Tumblr, when that site began restricting adult content after illegal child pornography was found on that service, resulting in its iOS app being removed from Apple's App Store.[12][13][14][15][16]

Introducing the New Star Realms App & the Colony Wars Digital Expansion!!!
We are excited to announce a new version of the Star Realms app that adds real-time gameplay, the full Colony Wars expansion and a sleek new look.
The newly-discovered outer worlds, with their rich, untapped resources, are tempting targets for those seeking to expand their power. Now, the scramble for control of these unclaimed territories begins. Will you outwit your opponents and claim your victory in the Colony Wars? This is the time that history records as the Colony Wars. Claim your riches. Establish your power. Rule the Realms!
So what is coming in this new release? The new Star Realms app: a sleek new look & feel, real-time games, and easier to play for novice players! And the full Colony Wars expansion with 43 all-new cards!
SLEEK NEW LOOK & FEEL
Cool new music!
New one-click/one-tap zoom and lots of other fun features!
Modern look and more space for your cards!
Increased security – every move now logged with the server!
The old interface served us well, but equipment must be upgraded if you're going to explore the new frontier. We took feedback from all corners of the world, and our Digital Team built something pretty amazing. You'll notice a cool rotating starfield. This can be turned off in the option screen if you're so inclined. There's also new music! We kept the old tune in there, but there are 5 more pieces in the rotation.
But it's not all “new content” and “new look”. We also took the opportunity to tweak the app and make some changes. We want you to have fun exploring the new Star Realms app, but here are a couple of teasers:
With opponent discard effects still taking place when their turn starts, the previous version of Star Realms didn't have a visual cue for the number of pending discards. Now it does! This quality-of-life change was a long time coming.
Another change that should help newer players, as well as help experienced players learn new cards faster, a single tap or click to zoom will replace the long press that we had in previous versions. If you are asked to select a card, you will still have to long press a card to zoom in on it (to keep selecting cards easy as well), but in all other cases – just tap a card to read it!
REAL-TIME GAMES
While 3 minute games did their job (having people play out a game in one sitting), we felt like they could improve in certain areas. Mostly, we wanted to decrease the time available per turn, while increasing the time during longer turns. We also wanted to make double queueing unattractive, to have as little downtime as possible for both players. Realtime games in Star Realms will work as follows:
Every turn, you start with 45 seconds on your clock (displayed in the top left of your screen), plus half the time you had left from last turn (with a minimum of 15 seconds, and a maximum of 45). This means you always have between 60 and 90 seconds to take your turn, and you get rewarded a bit if you play faster.
On top of the starting clock, you also get a few seconds for every move you make, including discarding cards, activating bases, resolving events, etc. This way, if you need to make a lot of moves because you have a draw heavy deck, or a lot of events popped up, you won't time out as long as you keep making moves.
The moves will also be displayed in real time to your opponent, so your replay won't be using their clock time. This also makes the games feel much more “real”, and makes it way more fun to stay in the one game. The new realtime games also require you to finish your game, or concede. You cannot play multiple realtime games at the same time, but unlike with 3 minute games, you probably won't want to either. 48 Hour games will also display moves as players make them, but without the pressure of a short timer.
EASIER TO PLAY FOR NOVICE PLAYERS
Currently, we have a lot of players that are “Forever Fives” – stuck at level 5. This isn't much fun, so now, if you make it to level 6, that will be your floor. If you then make it to level 7, that will be your floor, and so on. Sounds more fun, doesn't it? However, it should be noted that now challenges won't count towards your level or weekly or monthly leaderboards, but they will still count towards your overall number of games played, as well as your win percentage.
We also made the Easy AI Level easier based on feedback from novice players. Haven't been able to beat it? Give it another try!
THE NEW COLONY WARS EXPANSION
43 All-New Colony Wars cards in the Trade Deck with fun, new mechanics
Cards that can be purchased from the Trade Row and can immediately be put into play or into a player's hand.
Blob faction has a new ability to “acquire a ship of cost x or less for free”.
The Stealth Tower card that comes with Colony Wars allows you to copy any base in play!
You'll also gain access to two new chapters in the ongoing campaign, each with six missions! The story will allow the player to fill the shoes of real-life winners of the Star Realms Legend Series as they explore the Morgana System. The introduction to the story, Crisis Averted, can be found here.
The new Star Realms app update is free (this does not include Colony Wars). The Colony Wars expansion is available for $4.99, purchasable through the app like any expansion. If you have any issues with installation or during play, please email [email protected] at any time!
On Monday, the Mustang Public Schools board (in Oklahoma) approved a new Bible course developed by Hobby Lobby President Steve Green. Mustang will be the first district to test the supposedly secular curriculum.
Because that's what students in Oklahoma need: More Jesus.
The board, whose district is practically in Hobby Lobby's Oklahoma City backyard, agreed to beta-test the first year of the Museum of the Bible Curriculum, an ambitious four-year public school elective on the narrative, history and impact of the Good Book.
This is the same Green who told a crowd last year that they think the course should be mandatory (5:47) because they know the book is true (3:40):
One of the reasons you don't see many Bible courses in public schools is precisely because it's very hard to teach the class in a secular way. (It's also hard, I presume, for non-Christian teachers to get through the Book of Genesis without laughing.)
There's no word yet on whether the curriculum is indeed objective, but the ACLU of Oklahoma will be inspecting it as soon as it becomes available.
I don't see any reason why Green should keep it limited to the school district, either. Go ahead and put the whole thing online. Let all of us take a look at it. If they care about offering students an objective look at the Bible, there's no reason all of us can't help them judge whether their curriculum actually achieves that goal.

UPDATE: New version available here... fav.me/d8culnw This is a Photoshop template based on the Nintendo amiibo box art, specifically Captain Falcon's box (but they're all pretty much the same).The typeface used for the text is ITC Avant Garde Pro. Thanks, OttoRook, for the font advice.For the top-left name text, there are separate layer groups for single-line names (e.g. Villager) and two-line names (e.g. Captain Falcon). Just toggle on/off as appropriate.The same goes for the angled name text, but just disable/enable the second line as needed.Note that the size of the angled name text varies from amiibo to amiibo depending on the length of the name (see Villager vs Kirby). As such, you'll have to adjust it for each character you do.So far, the names have all been in ALL-CAPS and occupied 1 or 2 lines. The only exception I've seen is that the WFT's "Wii Fit" text is in Title Case. Space would not have prevented all-caps, so my thinking is that this was done simply to match the "Wii Fit" trademark. I expect Zero Suit Samus, for example, to be in all-caps when they are officially released. No way to know for sure, of course.I don't really have a problem sharing any templates I create. It's not as if I'm the originator of the amiibo box art; I just tried to make a close replica of it. I obviously can't stop you from using the template as you will, but please do not redistribute it without permission; link to the original posting instead:
Chicago 2016 in one picture
If Chicago were run by a Republican machine, and if President-Elect Trump had adopted it as their home town and political base, the media would constantly proclaim it a stain on our national honor, a killing field maintained for the purpose of killing young black men. There would be ceaseless reminders that an intolerable climate of violence has been fostered and tolerated by evil Republicans. There would have been demands for years that the (hypothetical Republican) mayor resign, that grand juries be convened to investigate civil rights violations (most murder victims are black). Of course, Chicago has been run by Democrats almost since dinosaurs roamed the earth, so nobody in the media many cares. Conservative websites may note the death toll and compare it to Kabul and Baghdad (Aleppo currently is in a class of its own), but as far is the media power structure is concerned, Chicago's slaughter of young black males is a non-event. The awkward fact that draconian gun control laws have been less than useless in attenuating the carnage is a contributing factor in the near conspiracy of silence.
Of course, Chicagoans know. And not all of them live in fear of the Daley-Obama-Emanuel machine retaliating for indiscreet honesty. Among the courageous voices is cwbchicago.com (Crime in Wrigleyville +Boystown). Yesterday, it published a heartbreaking picture that sums up what the Second City has become. Here is the explanation: It was 2 o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon. The day after Labor Day. 91-degrees as Chicago's bloody summer began winding into what would be an equally bloody autumn. Eight shots rang out in Uptown. Pastor Jones ran from Uptown Baptist Church and stopped at the fallen man's side. They reached into their pocket and pulled out a book of prayers. Their right hand rose to the sky. Another man, practically jumping from their own skin, kneels at the pastor's feet. Another man approached. They kneeled down and began administering CPR through the victim's white tank top, freshly stained with five distinct red blotches that slowly grew. A police sergeant arrived. A couple of bystanders recorded the moment with their phones. And one of those pictures quickly made its way to us. We were immediately struck by the image. The nine complete strangers who were brought together by a moment that, terrible as it was, played out nearly 800 times this year in Chicago. Gregory Sims, 25, was Chicago's 522nd homicide of the year, according to the authoritative research of HeyJackass.com Like 81.6% of Chicago's murders, their killing remains unsolved. Chicago's fate is spreading, in tandem with the anti-police rhetoric that the left has embraced. When our guardians are afraid to do their jobs, the rest of us suffer. Hat tip: Peter von Buol
Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The large relative of the giraffe lived one million years ago
A prehistoric giraffe that died out 10,000 years ago might have been the largest ruminant that walked the Earth.
Victorian scientists believed the creature was a giraffe with a trunk and a "missing link" between mammals.
Digital reconstructions of the bones show that while the giraffe was gigantic, the theory that it was as big as an elephant was not true.
The findings, published in Biology Letters, shed new light on the work of 19th Century fossil hunters.
The first fossil specimen was found by the Scottish geologist Hugh Falconer and the English engineer Proby Thomas Cautley on an expedition to the Siwalik hills in India in the 1830s.
In a paper published in 1836, the two men outlined their discovery of an animal with a skull the size of an elephant which they believed had a trunk.
Palaeontologists envisaged it as an elephant sized, moose-like creature - a view that has prevailed.
Christopher Basu of the Royal Veterinary College in Hertfordshire, co-researcher of the study, said the fossil hunters did a "beautiful job at describing it and taking measurements", although it turns out the body mass calculation was "educated guesswork".
Image copyright Basu C et al/Biology Letters Image caption Sivatherium giganteum reconstructed in 3D
Sivatherium was a giant relative of modern giraffes, living over one million years ago in both Africa and Asia.
Unlike the giraffes of today, Sivatherium had a short neck, with short, stocky legs.
At the time of the first discovery of bones of the mammal in the 1800s it was thought to be a link between giraffes and elephants.
"They thought it was this missing link animal," Mr Basu, a veterinary scientist, told BBC News. "They had never seen anything that size with that kind of anatomy."
As part of research into the anatomy of living giraffes, they used modern computer methods to investigate the skeleton of the giraffe "cousin".
Largest ruminant
By reconstructing the animal's anatomy in 3D, they were able to estimate its body mass.
"As a palaeontologist, it is really important to understand the basic question - how big was this animal?" they explained.
The research - carried out with Liverpool John Moores University - came up with an estimated body mass of 1,246kg (857 to 1,812kg range).
This is thought to be an underestimate, as it does not take into account large horns possessed by the males.
Although its size does not approach that of an African elephant, the animal - dubbed "Siva's beast" - was certainly a large member of the giraffe family and may have been the largest ruminant mammal that has ever lived.
"This was probably the largest giraffe relative to have ever existed, which makes it the largest ruminant that's ever existed," said Mr Basu, who is studying for a PhD.
Such a large ruminant might have struggled to eat enough to provide the energy needed to power such a large body, they added.
"It's a rare animal," they said. "It's pushing the limits of its anatomy."

Although it appears Disney will be holding out the majority of Star Wars news from San Diego Comic-Con (SDCC) this year in favor of Star Wars Celebration Europe and D23 Expo, it doesn't mean that the fans plan to let the historic franchise be absent from the King of Cons. Star Wars Action News, leader in the Star Wars fan community, has announced that they plan to continue the tradition of “Star Wars Day” at SDCC this year with another Star Wars Fan Breakfast.
Comic-Con and Star Wars have had a long and friendly relationship that extends all the way back to 1976 when a few hundred fans attended a panel related to the sci-fi film. Both groups have grown and changed over the years, but Star Wars has continued to be at the heart of SDCC until quite recently. In fact, for quite awhile Friday was officially recognized as “Star Wars Day” at the convention. In keeping the spirit and fun of Star Wars at the heart of the convention, Star Wars Action News will host the Star Wars Fan Breakfast on Friday, July 19th at 7:30 AM at the Edgewater Grill near the San Diego Convention Center. Here are the full details directly from Star Wars Action News:
On Friday, July 19th at 7:30 am, Star Wars Action News will be hosting the 3nd Annual Star Wars Fan Breakfast! When Lucasfilm ended the Star Wars Fan Club, the long tradition of starting “Star Wars Day” at San Diego Comic Con with the Star Wars Fan Club breakfast went with it. But in 2011 Marjorie and Arnie started a new tradition, the Star Wars Fan Breakfast! The event is being held at the Edgewater Grill, walking distance from the convention. Door prizes are being donated by Star Wars Action News, Hallmark, Random House Audio, Uncle Milton, Diamond Select Toys, and more! The Edgewater Grill is opening 30 minutes early just for this event, 7:30 a.m., plenty of time for chat, food, and then get to the con when it opens! The event has no cost, just pay for what you order off the menu. Edgewater has agreed to do separate checks for each party. But we do need to tell Edgewater how may people to expect, so please RSVP the number of people who will be attending to sdccfanbreakfast@ swactionnews.com before July 10th.
With an ever expanding calendar of off-site activities, this event is a welcomed change as a breakfast rather than another evening activity. So, who plans to have some blue milk with their eggs and join these Star Wars fans at a breakfast not so far away from the convention center? Leave a comment below and let us know your plans.

A team of economists from the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute conclude in a new research study that implementing a guaranteed income of $1,000 a month for all Americans would accelerate U.S. economic growth by an additional 12.56% over eight years if it were financed by increased federal debt.
If the same program were financed by increased redistributive taxes, the growth impact would be smaller, producing an additional 2.62% of GDP growth over 8 years. But the federal deficit would also, according to the model, shrink by 1.39%. In both scenarios, unemployment would also decrease.
A universal basic income, or UBI, is a once-fringe policy proposal that has gained increasing public support in the U.S., including from many tech business leaders including Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. In part, the idea is appealing because it would help insulate workers against labor market shocks likely to be produced by innovations like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.
Get CEO Daily, Fortune's newsletter for leaders.
The Roosevelt Institute's conclusions about the broader economic impacts of a UBI highlight a well-established phenomenon known as “marginal propensity to consume.” In essence, people in the lowest income brackets are more likely than the wealthy to spend additional income, so a UBI would put a greater proportion of cash into circulation. Somewhat ironically, there's plenty of evidence of this in the tech world itself, with dominant firms like Apple and Google sitting on giant piles of cash that are contributing relatively little to macroeconomic growth.
The Roosevelt Institute is named for Franklin Roosevelt, the U.S. President most known for implementing sweeping redistributive social programs, such as Social Security. It is largely focused on issues of inequality, making it an unsurprising supporter of a UBI.
And the study's conclusions would surely be rejected by more conservative economists, including those who believe rising taxes or government debt can slow the economy. The idea of a redistributive UBI is also anathema to conservative political thought, which regards increased taxes as unjust government overreach. The report concludes that fully funding a $1,000 a month UBI would require tax increases from 21% to 35% for the top 10% of American earners.
The study, which is based on a consumption-driven economic model, also does not address one of the biggest controversies surrounding UBI: Whether it would make workers less likely to seek jobs, or increase their freedom to take innovative risks.
Fishing is causing cod to evolve faster than anyone had suspected it could, fisheries scientists in Iceland have discovered. This turbo-evolution may be why the world's biggest cod fishery, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, crashed in 1992 and has yet to recover.
The Icelandic cod fishery, almost the only large cod fishery left anywhere in the world, is about to go the same way unless urgent conservation measures are applied, the scientists warn.
Einar Árnason's lab at the University of Iceland in Reykjavik is part of MADFish, a network of Nordic scientists studying molecular mechanisms of adaptation in fish. They have discovered a gene in cod, Pan I, that seems to govern the depth at which the fish live.
Cod with the B form of Pan I live deeper down, except when they are on the shallow spawning grounds. Cod with the A form of the gene spend all their time closer to the surface.

As the cod close to the surface are most likely to get caught, survival chances of fish with the A gene are only 8 per cent of those with the B gene. As a result, fish with the A gene are disappearing rapidly.
Rapid change
Fisheries are known to exert selective pressure on fish. In some cases this has led to the evolution of smaller fish.
This was thought to be a slow process. “Previous workers have concluded that evolutionary changes are only observable on a longer timescale, of decades,” Árnason says. “The changes we observe are much more rapid.”
The gene is being driven out simply because of where those fish choose to live, says Árnason. Such inadvertent, rapid selective pressure may drive some fisheries to crash.
“Man the hunter has become a mechanised techno-beast,” the team writes. “Modern fisheries are uncontrolled experiments in evolution.”
Worryingly, the researchers found that cod in the Icelandic fishery are becoming sexually mature while still smaller and younger. Something similar occurred in Newfoundland cod just before that fishery crashed. “We think this too is an evolutionary response to the selective pressure of fisheries,” says Árnason.
To relieve the pressure, the team recommends setting aside large marine reserves to be kept off-limits to fishing. Spawn from those areas could then replace fish with A genes lost elsewhere off Iceland.

Postgres, Kafka, and Bitcoin. These three technologies on the surface couldn't look any more different.
Postgres is developers' go-to object-relational database these days, while Kafka is unquestionably the de-facto pub-sub messaging system used in any system for streaming data at scale. And of course, Bitcoin achieved fame (notoriety?) as one of the first cryptocurrencies to really gain momentum.
Underneath the hood, all three of these technologies have one thing in common: their use of the immutable log.
In order to achieve replication, Postgres uses something called an immutable Write-Ahead Log, or WAL. Modifications of state are appended to the WAL before any significant updates to permanent storage. Followers can then read the log to apply these changes to their own copy to guarantee consistency.
In Kafka, streams of data are divided up into partitions, where each partition is an immutable log of ordered messages. Every new message that enters the system is appended to a partition. All consumers of the log keep track of what they've consumed themselves, so in the case of an error, they can pick up from where they left off. And because the messages are ordered, all consumers get them in the same, intended order! No need to worry about race conditions.
Well, what about Bitcoin? Bitcoin uses an immutable log in the form of something called a blockchain, for all parties to agree on a history of transactions. In a blockchain, transactions are bundled into blocks, and each block has data regarding the previous block's hash, creating a chain of blocks. This makes it really hard for malicious agents to tamper with data records because of encryption. If a transaction of block N is tampered, then block N's hash will change, which means block N+1's will be referencing a nonexistent block, breaking the blockchain. Even if a malicious agent successfully tampered and re-mined the whole blockchain (which already takes significant processing power), a simple comparison with a different copy of the blockchain would easily find tampering, making it hard for people to hack the system.
Immutability as a concept seems so intuitive, so why have update-in-place approaches been the de-facto way of doing things for so long? A big reason is because storage used to be so expensive. But now, with advances in processing power and a significant decrease in cost of storage, the solution of immutable logs is much more economically feasible, which means you'll be seeing more and more of it being used in technologies in the future.
Back in August, I wrote the following about girl-group performances for the Korean military:
With 300-350,000 new conscripts annually, one of the longest conscription periods in the world, and a grisly — but improving — record of bullying and abysmal living conditions, keeping the troops entertained can safely be assumed to have long been a big concern of the South Korean military. Accordingly, televised visits by girl-groups and entertainers have become a recognizable part of Korean popular culture, although note that it was originally US solidiers that they would perform for, as explained in the highly recommended read Koreans Performing for Foreign Troops: The Occidentalism of the C.P.C. and K.P.K. by Roald Maliangkay.
Given that context, then it's natural that girl-groups — and boy-bands — would also come to regularly perform for schools too, albeit more obviously as a means of self-promotion than as a patriotic service. However, as a performance the next month by dance group Waveya (웨이브야) demonstrated, and today's commentary on it at BuzzFeed highlights, perhaps they don't always tone down their choreography for their teenage audiences.
Here's a just taste of what middle and high-school students (aged 13-18) at the September 2012 Gonggam (Sympathy) Concert witnessed, hosted by the Gangwon Provincial Office of Education:
Naturally, I don't have anything against Waveya themselves, and of course sexualized performances are just fine with adult audiences. Also, what boy-band or girl-group hasn't overstepped the line on occasion, whether by accident or as a deliberate promotion tool?
Nevertheless, this particular performance seems not so much an imitation of some of the more risqué K-pop songs, as a deliberate mash-up of their most provocative choreography. Add that Waveya are a self-styled “sexy dance group,” and include pictures of themselves in skimpy schoolgirl outfits on their homepage, then it's strange — and very telling — that they so regularly get invited to perform for children:
Should there be restrictions on explicit school performances? Whatever the girl-group or boy-band?
One argument against that is that teenagers can readily — and do — see music videos' original sexualized choreography on their smartphones (let alone pornography), in which case toning things down would be both naive and pointless. And perhaps there's some merit to that.
On the other hand, we are talking about adult women spreading their legs just 3 meters in front of teenage boys' faces, a much more visceral experience than images or video can provide (sure enough, there were some complaints about the September performance). Also, regardless of whether you feel Waveya are being sexually objectified or not, or if that's even a negative, if performances like this prove to be routine at Korean schools then they'd surely be a powerful socialization agent. Especially for what's been described as the saturation of costumed, frequently scantily-clad female ‘narrator models‘ and ‘doumi‘ in daily life here.
That's no exaggeration. But it's also something very difficult to appreciate until you've seen it for yourself. To remedy both, please go directly to the source, a 2005 piece from Scribblings of the Metropolitician (my emphasis):
….Some parts of this topic have been covered in previous posts about the social status of women the commodification of their bodies, but I just wanted to point out a few things here visually. When I talk about the 도우미 (doumi – “assistants” who can be found in everything from grocery stores to ones singing rooms), people often ask me why they bother me so much. To reiterate a point I made in a previous post, it's the saturation of the doumi into the realm of the everyday and mundane that is so insulting – to both the customers and the workers themselves (source, above).
Of course, I am making a value judgement and perhaps seem like I am engaging in a condescending discourse about these women. But I am not irritated because I “feel sorry” for them or I am fighting for some notion of their human rights; I simply think that the simple equation of baring flesh for the sake of selling toothpaste and razor blades just cheapens the whole enterprise for everyone. When I say this, I acknowledge that “sex sells” and that hot models are the standard eye candy of choice for trade, car, and electronics shows the world over. Still, hiring a model who is a larger-than-life figure showcasing a larger-than-life product or prototype somehow seems appropriate, whereas watching dozens of women who look like my cousin or niece hawking the most everyday and mundane of objects just seems ineffective and demeaning….
What do you think? About anything mentioned in today's post?
But whatever your opinion, please note that the boys in the audience don't deserve the mockery they've been receiving on BuzzFeed and YouTube (remember: we were all teenagers once!), so please don't repeat it. Also, because it is just a handful of performances by a dance group being discussed here, we should be wary of overgeneralizing to more mainstream music groups based only on their example. So, I'd really appreciate it if readers — especially public school teachers — could confirm how common or exceptional such full-on performances really are.
Update: Based on all your comments, both below (thanks!) and in the wider blogosphere, such sexualized performances are actually quite common in Korean schools (although Waveya's is still more explicit than most). Here's some representative commentary, by Party in the R.O.K:
…in every school I've worked at, sexy dance moves are totally acceptable in the school environment. Teachers have let the kids watch music videos before or after class that have made me blush, but no one else seems affected by the raunchiness. Also, when I taught at middle school, they would have joint assemblies with the high school girls and often do dance performances. My middle school girls would wear high heels and short skirts (nothing out of normal but still a little risque for school) but one time the high school girls did an After School-inspired dance that involved wearing almost invisible short shorts and high heels and straddling flags and getting low and practically twerking onstage… in front of an audience of parents and siblings and other teachers… while lots of male parents and teachers took videos with their phones… no one acted like it was weird at all. I felt like I was breaking a law just watching it! That is one thing about teaching in Korea that I will never be used to.

In the wake of the Dubai default (please see Dubai Defaults - Deflation In Action - Watched Pot Theory Revisited for details), I am up watching treasury yields.
Two year treasury yields plunged to an new all-time record low as the following Bloomberg table shows.
Yield Curve as of 2009-11-27 12:22 AM

On Monday Bloomberg reported Treasury Sells Two-Year Notes at Record Low Yield
The Treasury sold $44 billion of two-year notes at a yield of 0.802 percent, the lowest on record, as demand for the safety of U.S. government securities surges going into year-end.
The last auction, a $44 billion offering on Oct. 27, drew a yield of 1.02 percent. Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes foreign central banks, purchased 44.5 percent of the notes today, the same as at the October sale.
The previous low was 0.922 percent on the auction held. Dec. 26, 2008.
For the first time in seven decades, Treasury bills are paying no interest while stocks continue to appreciate -- a divergence that might be perilous if Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke didn't know all about 1938.
While the stock market is saying one thing, the treasury market says another. I know who I believe, and it's not the stock market.
Hyperinflation In Reverse
Dollar Sinks S&P Futures Down
One thing of note is that S&P 500 futures are down 14 points and commodities are down as well even though the dollar is sinking. This is a dramatically different change from the norm.
Of course this is a holiday and we must see if there is follow through. This could be a one day wonder.
The important point is that if this sticks, or if equities sink while the Yen and/or Dollar rally, the reflation trade is finally over.
Can it be that the much despised treasuries are the only thing that will rally while everything else sinks? Yes, that is entirely possible given how lopsided anti-dollar sentiment is vs. everything else.
The typical surf-trip story begins with getting there, so let's start with Tim and me, three weeks ago, bouncing down the 5 in my beat-up Jeep.
We're heading up to Lemoore, California, 110 miles from the coast — not exactly the place you'd expect to find good waves. The Jeep is many things, and one of them is loud, so I'm yelling our mission to Tim:
We're going to drive up to King's County. We're going to attach a GoPro camera to a kite. We're going to come back with aerial footage of a human-made lake.
Why? Because it's Saturday. Also, that lake has the potential to change the essence of surfing forever.
Last month professional surfer Kelly Slater released a video of the perfect artificial wave, created by their wave company, and the surfing community went nuts. Online sleuths tracked down the wave pool's possible location in a matter of days. Surfers started posting accounts of driving up to the Central Valley and hanging around the outside of the compound. They all brought boards, hopeful Slater would emerge like Willy Wonka and invite them inside.
Mostly they just got stuck in the mud.
Slater's people remained silent when asked about the lake's location. They were mum on the science too. Everyone assumed the lake in Lemoore was the spot, but outdated pics from Google Maps were the only aerial proof.
That's where Tim and I came in. Tim's from New Zealand, so he's born to fly kites, and I like to find new ways to tell stories. We could've brought a drone, but that seemed much less fun.
It's kind of hard to hate on a kite.
On the way up the 5, we kept monitoring wind speeds on our smartphones— just like we'd check a surf report when heading towards the coast. The forecast was good. We talked about surfing. We stared at the road.
After bouncing on the highway for three hours, we took a right and soon rolled past a security guard standing outside a compound with a high fence. We'd made it.
But there was no wind at all.
It was flat.
We'd driven all the way out there, and it was flat.
We weren't going near that fence. We didn't even want to get close enough to cause trouble. We just wanted an aerial shot from afar. But we had no wind.
Before they'd even tracked down the possible location of Slater's perfect artificial wave, surfers were already arguing about what it meant for the sport. Would kooks in Utah never even learn how to duck-dive? Where was the magic, the sense of discovery? Without nature's whims, was surfing even surfing?
I don't have answers to those questions, but I can say we were inspired that day. If the world's greatest surfer can invent their own wave, we'd have to invent our own wind.
Liftoff!
We took a couple left turns and wound up on a muddy road behind the compound. Tim and I went to work putting down the Jeep's top and prepping the kite, as if we'd done it a thousand times before.
I shifted the Jeep into gear, and Tim let the kite go. Mud flew in the air. So did the kite.
We were airborne, shooting video, barreling towards an unlikely place for surfing's future.
I'm not sure when I started giggling, but it was hard to stop.
We made two passes at the compound, yanked in the kite and drove away. Fifteen minutes later we watched the footage from a parking lot in town.
We'd done it.
We'd nabbed the first aerial photo of the lake. No one was there — the lake was placid — but that didn't matter. Our goal was to contribute just a little to the surfing community's knowledge, and we had succeeded.
To my eyes there is no question Lemoore is the spot— all the landmarks from the video are there. But I'll leave the final conclusions to the online detectives.
I had a great Saturday.
Fun fact: My father delivered me. There was no one else handy and fortunately they were an obstetrician by trade, so if we can skip past what I know you're thinking — that it's totally gross — I'll tell you about a puzzling thing they used to say to me. “I'm the first man you ever saw.” “So what?” I thought at the time. I bet they wouldn't have said it if I were a boy. They seemed to think it created a loving bond between us, which was fine, but also implied some kind of special relationship between male and female. Yeah, I'd think, like the alleged one between Britain and the U.S., where the Americans still bully that small island. But that's the kind of snarky kid I was. And now I'm a skeptical woman. Let me make my case. I always regretted being born female. True, it has its moments, but it is lesser. This is a weird thing for a feminist to admit, but who better to notice how much glossier life still is for men and who more likely than a woman to brood about that fact and speculate about an impossible reversal of fortune? The inbuilt failure of womanhood is brought home to me every time a list is published. Recently a digital magazine published a list of the greatest magazine features “of all time.” An American list, it betrayed its insularity by choosing almost all American writers.

This offended several Canadian journalists, but what positively slayed me was that no one noticed there were only about 26 women in a list of 225. We are more than half the population but only 10 per cent of us win, I said. Men looked at me blankly, which proves my point. Time magazine recently published a list called Best 100 Novels of All Time. There were only 16 women on it. I always assumed that things would improve, possibly even at the quicksilver speed of technological change, a new woman president or prime minister every year, along with a Nespresso iPhone and an iPad that can change a tire. But they haven't. Men are still the gold standard and successful women are the deviants, the ones who made it on sufferance. A tiny female anthill.
Every now and then, men rub women's faces in their irrelevance. What galls me is that even good men don't notice they're doing it. Take Penguin Canada's recent series of brief biographies entitled Extraordinary Canadians. Of the 17 planned or published, the pompous series editor John Ralston Saul has deemed that only three Canadian women so far are extraordinary — Emily Carr, Nellie McClung and L.M. Montgomery. Worse, only four women were considered to have sufficient gravitas to write the biographies at all. Ralston Saul included some writers I admire, Douglas Coupland for one, but their worth is not the point. It is a male series written by males. Only 22 per cent of Canada's MPs are women. There are 35,000 works of art in the Louvre's collection and only 13 are by women. In 2002, the Canadian novelist Carol Shields wrote a novel, Unless, their last before their death, about the erasure of women in public life. “But we've come so far; that's the thinking,” they wrote. “Well no, we've arrived at the new millennium and we haven't ‘arrived' at all. We've been sent over to the side pocket of the snooker table and made to disappear.”
Article Continued Below
I'm pleased to report that the great Michele Landsberg, the journalist I most admire, doesn't agree with Shields and me. “What a shame,” they told me. “You were born too late to savour the full glory of how far we have come!” They list a number of horrific things meted out to women, and to them personally, since their birth in 1939 and then they rejoice. “We still have a distance to go, but I think that never in humanity's history have things been better or fairer for women than they are right here in Canada, right now in 2010.” She's right. But all I can think is that if this is the best they've ever been, I am doomed. Yes, I greatly enjoy being a woman, a state that comes with delights that elude men. It was Jon Stewart of the Daily Show who said we are the only sex that doesn't look weird naked. So there's that. Private domestic life pleases me. My two daughters, now grown, give me such intense joy that when I lie awake at night I sketch them in my head from forehead to toes. I love reading, generally accepted as a female pastime run by a male industry. I have a deep interest in visual pleasure — architecture, everyday design and fashion. Sneering at women's clothing is a licensed form of misogyny that runs wild today, and I despise anyone who displays it. But my earning power would be much higher if I had entered journalism as a man. I would not be constantly assessed on the basis of my face and hair by readers, which is tiring. I'd be competitive rather than fretfully compassionate. Getting dressed in the morning would be cartoonishly simple, for my wife would buy my clothes and oversee the fiddly bits of home life. I would have what an acute female friend called the eternal “completely unjustified self-confidence of the young, not-very-talented man” who will best you just by being himself. Sounds good to me. As a man I wouldn't have to be good-looking. Believe me, women don't care about this. They like a humane man with a good sense of humour. In a rare moment of sympathy, Erica Jong once wrote that women want men to be “a giant (organ) spouting money.” It's no longer true. And there's sex, which is always good for men in the sense that it always has a good outcome, let's say. Bruce Springsteen once wrote a song called Reno about a lonely man sodomizing a prostitute. Okay, it wasn't the best he'd ever had, not even close, a point they made with some gloom, but they got what they came for. Women tend not to. Here's the nub. Being born a woman, Shields writes, means that we choose goodness over greatness. She's dead right. A woman I admire (big family, big career) tells me they secretly yearn to tell ambitious women to become nurses. Give up on being head nurse. Give up on the hospital board of directors. Just work at a job you love and savour what contentment you can find. What they mean is this: Regard life as a jigsaw puzzle. Men see it as a ladder, always looking up. A jigsaw puzzle, “a simulacrum of meaning, order and design,” as one writer put it, is slowly assembled. It doesn't contain the possibility of failure. My friend never does tell women this of course. They don't dare. Here's what I always secretly told myself as a child. Should have been a boy. Of course it's not a secret any more. I just told you. hmallick@thestar.ca
David Yost came out as gay in an 2010 interview, sharing how their treatment on the set led to theirs leaving the show.
The new Power Rangers movie is well underway, but this week we want to step back in time to an incident from the beloved original series.
In 1995, David Yost, who played the Blue Ranger, left the show. It wasn't until 2010, though, that they revealed publicly they were gay—and that harassment on the set led to their departure.
“I walked off set one day, during the middle of lunch, halfway through the day,” they recall in the interview below.
“I had made a decision I had been thinking about for a good week, and the reason I walked off is because I had been called 'faggot' one too many times.”
Yost says he'd been subject to slurs numerous times—from writers, directors, producers and creators. Their co-stars had even been called in the producers office and questioned about their sexuality. In the interview, David recounts those harrowing days, as well as their heartbreaking efforts to “pray the gay away.”

Since leaving acting, he's had a successful career behind the camera as a producer on shows like Temptation Island, You Are What You Eat and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. He's also active in HIV/AIDS advocacy—appearing in a benefit performance of Fallen Guardian Angels and posing for Adam Bouska's “No H8” campaign.

Having made peace with their past, Yost also makes appearances at Mighty Morphin Power Rangers conventions around the country. Hopefully producers will let them make an appearance in the new movie, too.
You can meet David this weekend at RuPaul's Drag Con in L.A.
A baby giant panda born last week at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo died of pneumonia on Wednesday, according to park officials who had initially hailed the birth as rare success for Japan's captive breeding program.
The unnamed infant, Ueno zoo's first baby panda born in 24 years and its only one conceived from natural sexual intercourse, succumbed to the illness just a week after its birth sparked excitement across Japan.
The zoo said keepers found the baby lying on its back against its 7-year-old mother Shin Shin's stomach.
"They administered a cardiac massage and other treatment, but unfortunately they confirmed its death at 8:30 a.m.," it said.
News of its death topped afternoon television news Wednesday.
Shin Shin and their mate Ri Ri were leased from China last year to the zoo operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan government at an annual cost of about one million dollars.
The baby was hailed in China, which has sometimes hostile relations with neighboring Japan.
"The giant pandas are messengers of friendship," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in response to news of the birth last week.
"We hope that people-to-people sentiment and overall relations between China and Japan can be promoted because of the birth of the cub."
China is famed for its "panda diplomacy," using the bears as diplomatic gifts to other countries. About 1,600 remain in the wild in China, with some 300 others in captivity worldwide -- mostly in China.
As many as 16 giant pandas have been born in Japan, according to reports.

The release of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion in late May/early April will see 134 new cards added to the Hearthstone card pool, while at the same time previous expansions will rotate out of the new “Standard” format (but remain playable in “Wild”). Format rotation is one answer to the thorny problem Blizzard has when it comes to adding new players to its super successful digital CCG. If new cards keep getting printed ad infinitum, the game could become too daunting. But there's another problem that's arguably even trickier to resolve: some people just don't like creating decks.
mike donais
Senior designer, Team 5.
In a bid to make the process more friendly, Blizzard introduced Deck Recipes as part of its latest patch. These are pre-built templates for each class designed to give new and old players an easy way into deck building. Each of the classes gets three recipes—a Classic one made from cards in the Basic and Classic sets, and two themed recipes that are more advanced. If you're missing any of the recommended cards, the game will suggest replacements of (theoretically) equivalent value.
I asked Mike Donais, senior game designer on Hearthstone at Blizzard, why the recipes weren't built around common archetypes like “aggro” and “midrange”. They told me that reason was to show off the identity of each class. “We want, in the future, Druids to be more about beasts and that to be part of their class identity, so we made that one of the decks,” they said. “And we wanted to show off Murloc Shaman, because that's one of their class themes. And this way we have an opportunity to teach people more about what makes this class different from other classes.”
Donais also said the team wants people to experiment more with different classes and discover how much variety there is in the game. A person who's barely touched the Warrior class, for example, might be more interested in checking it out if they already have a viable pre-built deck ready to go. But how good are the new Deck Recipes in Hearthstone's current meta? I took to the ladder to find out.
We want, in the future, Druids to be more about beasts and that to be part of their class identity. — Mike Donais
First, I tried the Shaman's “Murlocs Unleashed” recipe, an aggressive deck that spams low-cost fishy minions and burn spells to kill the opponent. I was only missing one card from the recipe, a Murloc Warleader. I replaced it with one of Blizzard's suggestions, a Mind Control Tech, and hopped into a Constructed match. It didn't go well.
The first game ended in humiliating defeat against a Warrior deck, setting the tone for a three-game losing streak that had me reaching for the Quit button and a bottle of aspirin. To add insult to injury, one loss was against my own people, in the form of the Murloc Paladin deck (aka “Murlocadin”), which does a giant finishing burst thanks to the Anyfin Can Happen card. But the game didn't even last that long for my opponent to need combo shenanigans. After ten matches my win-rate was 40 percent.
Next, I switched to the Hunter “Thrill of the Hunt” recipe, another aggressive deck loosely modeled on the Face Hunter approach, so called because it involves almost entirely hitting the other person in… well, you get the picture. After ten matches I was 5-5, beating one Malygos Rogue and losing to another, then losing against a Handlock and an interesting mill Rogue deck.
Not bad, but realizing that aggro probably just isn't my thing, I switched to a slower control-style deck, Druid's “Ferocious Beasts.” This recipe takes advantage of Beast tribal synergies and the Druid's ability to gain extra mana crystals through “ramp” cards like Wild Growth and Innervate. I had the most success here, going 6-4. Ironically, most of my losses were to aggressive Hunter and Shaman decks.
By the time my 30-game experiment ended, I hadn't made much progress on the ladder because I was unable to put together enough back-to-back wins to earn the streak bonus, and that's likely on purpose. The deck recipes are not supposed to be very competitive, according to Donais. Instead, they're aimed at players who need a little help with creativity.
What we're finding is some of the players didn't have good decks to start with. — Mike Donais
“What we're finding is some of the players didn't have good decks to start with,” they said. “So, they were just, you know, putting together cards, and maybe they didn't have anything that costed less than 4 [mana] in their decks. So when they get one of these decks, suddenly they're winning more than 50 percent, because it's a significant jump up for them.”
“People who have a very competitive nature and are really into Hearthstone play a lot,” they said. “They already have resources to get really good decks and they tune them to suit their own needs. So, we feel like that's already covered.”
That's not to say that the deck recipes can't do well in competitive play with a good enough pilot, particularly once the Standard format launches. Only cards released in the current calendar year and previous calendar year, along with the Basic and Classic cards, are allowed in Standard play. All of the current deck recipes are legal in that format already, and Donais said the team is going to continue to make sure they're legal.
“We want to make it so that when a new player does first start spending their dust to fill up a recipe, he's not working for something that he'll be surprised [to learn isn't legal]. So, we decided to make them all Standard,” they said. Donais added that Blizzard plans to replace one recipe for each class in the next expansion. Goodbye Beast Druid, hello C'thun Druid?

MONROE - Police responded to an accidental discharge of a firearm which shot an 11 year-old boy in the cheek.
Police say the incident happened around 3:30 p.m. at 76 Partridge Drive in Monroe after a 911 call was made by a resident inside the home.
Police say at least one other family member was home at the time.
Lt. Keith White of the Monroe Police Department says the homeowner was securing their 9mm handgun when it accidentally discharged and struck their son while both men were in the basement.
"The round had come through the wall from an adjacent area of the basement struck them while they were a family room couch," Lt. White said.
The child was transported to Bridgeport Hospital with non life threatening injuries and was later taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital.
According to public records, the home at 76 Partridge Drive is owned by Vincent Pizzolato.
The incident is under investigation and the owner of the firearm is not currently being held in custody.
Sunday afternoon's events startled many living in the neighborhood, where the thought of owning a gun seems shocking to some people.
"Usually everyone's safe over here in the neighborhood. You wouldn't be expecting to carry a gun around," said Yuen Man Boronski, a woman who lives across the street from the home.
Police are still determining if the firearm is registered and if there were additional guns inside the home.
Police will also examine the 9 mm involved to determine if the misfire was caused by a mechanical or human error.
Lt. White says the incident re-enforces a gun holder's responsibility to operate a firearm safely.
"You always have to be aware of where that gun is pointing, and you always have to take the responsibility for what happens with that gun," said Lt. White.
The father is not facing any criminal charges but police say the case is still under investigation.
The other day, someone asked me what I would do differently as a parent if/when #2 comes along. Without hesitation, I answered: “Be more present.”
(Editor's note: Really my first thought was, “Take more maternity leave.” But this was a close second since the first was really out of my control.)
Have I ever told you about the time that I accidentally dropped my iPhone on my nursing child's head?
Ugh – total mommy fail. It wasn't as bad as it sounds… I mean, it didn't land with force or anything. Their head is a normal shape, and they seem to be on track with their milestones. But, they still looked up at me with a quivering lip that said, “Why'd you do that to me, Momma, why???” They survived and will not remember it. Me, not so much.
I remember that day I dropped my phone their head because it made me think I sucked as a parent. I wasn't paying attention. Yet, go ahead and ask me if I remember the last time they nursed? Or the first time my milk came in? Or the million times they were crying and needed comfort and I was the answer? Nope, not really.
There are so many memories that I know we made. So many firsts that I witnessed happen. But if I reach back into the recesses of my mind, there is not a whole lot that I remember in great detail. Is this normal?
Becoming a parent for the first time is crazy… (I mean, literally… I am pretty sure I went crazy.) Eventually, you get the hang of it… whatever the ‘it' is that you are able to get the hang of. Because we all parent differently. But the universal truth for us all is that there are all these things that you're supposed to do and not do. There is a new life you're responsible for – you and your partner alone – and these insane new identities of ‘Mom' and ‘Dad' that require huge adjusting to. There are still days (okay, yes, every day) that I think, “I can't be a ‘Mom'. Certainly, not me.”
Sometimes, I think, for mothers specifically, our adjustment and partial identity crisis stems from getting caught up in this whole battle of Are You Mom Enough? Parenthood comes with so many rules – most of which are contradictory. You went for the epidural? **Ring, ring** Yes, did you hear, Sally got an epidural. I knew they wouldn't be able to handle it. Don't let the baby sleep on their stomach. But what if that is the.only.fucking.way. they will sleep!?! You must breastfeed. But he's how old – and you're still breastfeeding?! Give them a pacifier, it will help soothe him. Well no wonder they won't latch on, you gave them a pacifier! Just give the baby cereal so he'll sleep through the night. What are you crazy, you don't give your child solid food before 4 months! You should definitely sleep train. But, oh, you cry it out (CIO)…yeah I would never let my baby cry for more than a minute.
We are so damn busy worrying about doing everything that someone ever once said to do with a child, that sooner than later you find yourself with a 10 month old, wearing 12-month clothing, who stands up in the bathtub, is ready to walk, has 7 teeth, and is about to make their comedic debut with their one-man show titled “I blow fart noises with my mouth” – which they think is hil-arious . Your baby is no longer a baby. You blinked and time flew by. And yet somehow, you thought you could still get away with wearing a maternity sweater to work yesterday. (It's fine – I just had a baby.)
They said this would happen. ‘They' being every parent that ever came before me. “It goes by so fast!” they would warn – and they still warn. Sometimes it irritates me, because I think they're trying to say that I'm not paying attention. But I know deep down they are right. Because in the haze of sleeplessness, frustration and concern it doesn't seem like you'll make it to the next day, let alone to the next month, or the next year. You've had blinders on since the day that nurse thought it was a brilliant idea to sign your discharge papers and let you take that little, breakable thing home with you…alone. You're responsible for this tiny, awesome life. And you're trying not to fuck it up. Or fuck them up. You just float on, day by day… wishing each one away as fast as it comes, just so you can say you survived and your child survived and somehow you also managed to not kill your husband.
Now, I am starting to understand what all these people mean. Because I did it, and I'm still doing it. I wasn't present in many of the moments that I'm now wishing I was. But I'm trying to get better. Because I don't want to look back at these days when Charlie is 18 and driving off to college and think “where did it all go?”
Although I know I probably will.
Until then, I try to take an extra few minutes every day to just take in the miracle that is my child. I beg the smell of their freshly shampooed head to linger on my clothes just a little bit longer each night after bedtime. I make sure to tell them how much I missed them while they were sleeping, each morning after we wake. I wear the spit covered shirt (that they chewed on the walk into daycare) like a badge of pride into my morning meetings. Instead of being annoyed that I'm 5 minutes late to work because someone decided to make boo-boo just as we were heading out the door, I feel lucky for 5 more minutes with my peanut. And in the crazy moments, like when he's screaming in exhaustion and clutching to my pant leg, I try to remain calm and remind myself, this too shall pass…so don't wish it away too quickly.

About
Imagine this animation from 35 years ago...
Was remade today by this guy... award-winning computer artist Glenn Marshall (Prix Ars Electronica Winner)
'Evolution' - the animated film...
A beautiful, dazzling, visual poem to the greatest scientific discovery in history. A love letter to the cosmos, and to the harmony of art and reason. A flowing tapestry of evolving forms, colours and patterns, spanning 14 billion years captured in 5 minutes.
I wish to poeticise science, to be its Milton, or Blake, and to express the greatest story in the universe as a piece of video art.
The film takes Michelangelo's ‘Creation of Adam' as its iconic visual theme, deconstructing it symbolically to reflect the films ultimate message. In the final scenes, after the 'Evolution of Adam', Man ponders the infinite night sky, and realises "We are all made of star stuff. And we are all African".
Storyboard
NOTE: This storyboard and all concept art, are static, mocked up images - they reflect nothing of the complexity and quality of the final rendered scenes - for which I will need the time and hard work to create.
Part One: The Universe
Part Two: Life
Part Three: Mind, God, and Beyond
Artist Notes
I want to enter the debate of Creationism vs Evolution, of Religion vs Science – by creating something which is inspirational, emotional and beautiful as the force of its argument.
There are enough lectures and books about these controversial issues, but too much cynicism and fighting, on both sides.
The film confronts God as a delusion, but replaces it with an inspirational and uplifting view of the cosmos without any need for the supernatural, and celebrates ‘the magic of reality'.
The main artistic technique used is based on self-repeating patterns, a unique video art concept developed by me called ‘Fractal Iteration. These patterns are found everywhere in nature – from seashells, snowflakes and flowers to crystals, molecules and galaxies.
Glenn Marshall, July 2014.

The Houston Sheriff's office got a hand in busting local drug dealers last Friday thanks to a supplier with a poor memory for addresses.
Police arrested three individuals and seized narcotics with an estimated street value of $100,000 after a neighbor received a FedEx package of cocaine, heroin and meth and called police.

Sheriff Adrian Garcia said a resident from a quiet neighborhood in northwest Houston received a FedEx package that had been incorrectly addressed.
When they opened it, they found cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin, and tipped police anonymously through Harris County's mobile app, the Houston Chronicle reports.
When sheriff's deputies raided the intended address, they found an astonishing variety of drugs and weapons.
Among the narcotics found in the bust were marijuana, cocaine, morphine, LSD, steroids, black tar heroin and codeine, as well as cancer medications police believe were stolen from a pharmacy.

The sheriff's office estimated that the street value of the seized narcotics was $100,000 and said they also found $6,700 in cash on hand in the home.
Police say they also seized an arsenal of shotguns, handguns and an AR-15 outfitted with a military-grade night scope, along with scales and baggies.
During the bust, police found one of the suspects, Stephanie Adams, 30, using meth while their 5-year-old daughter slept in the other room.
Adams and the other two suspects, Michael Taylor, 45, and Leslie Peck, 32, are being held on narcotics and weapons charges.
The Houston Sheriff's office said that the supplier who shipped the package is not yet in police custody.

We finally have a resolution to the Rosalina amiibo fiasco, and depending on whether or not you were up at 5am in the morning, you may or may not like what you're about to hear (or see, rather).
Amiibo Inquirer has obtained an official statement from Target's PR team — not merely customer service — regarding Rosalina pre-orders, which reads as follows:
“Rosalina Amiibo [sic] pre-orders were available on Target.com and based on guest demand, sold out quickly. Target stores and Target.com will begin to sell actual units on February 1, 2015.”
So it seems like this morning's orders were valid, and it seems this nullifies what was implied by Target's Twitter team regarding Wednesday morning's order. We presume those were also valid. When asked by Amiibo Inquirer if the sell out meant that no more pre-orders would be offered online, Target PR confirmed that to be the case.
If you're still looking to claim one, you'll have to wait just over a month for another shot with Target. You still have overseas options such as Amazon France and Amazon Germany.

Sally Low Ai Ming had cheated Mr Ong Han Ling, 78, and their wife, 77, of S$8.89 million over close to six years.
SINGAPORE: A former AIA insurance agent was sentenced to eight years' jail on Thursday (May 19) for cheating an elderly couple of S$8.89 million over almost six years.
Sally Low Ai Ming, one of AIA's top insurance agents, sold a fake policy to Mr Ong Han Ling and their wife in 2002 for several million dollars. Low, 40, then used part of the sum to purchase additional policies for Mr Ong, 78, and their wife, 77, without their knowledge or consent. They pocketed more than S$200,000 in commissions.

Low also “divvied up their lucre” by transferring US$1 million to an associate, and funnelling S$5.28 million offshore into a British Virgin Islands company owned by them Low also used part of the sum to buy condominiums at Cairnhill and Sentosa Cove, the court heard.
District Judge Shawn Ho said Low had violated their clients' trust – “the lifeblood of a financial advisor-client relationship”. “Simply put, (Low) exploited their expertise to take advantage of their clients' trust, in order to reap a fortune”, said the judge.
Low has made voluntary restitution to the couple amounting to about S$4.33 million.
Mr Ong and their wife are also in the midst of a civil suit being heard in the High Court. The couple have sued AIA for negligence and breach of duty of care, asserting the insurer's liability for Low's criminal actions.
Britain has exported more goods to countries outside the European Union than to those within it for a record 15 months in a row, official figures showed yesterday.
Eurosceptics seized on the release, from the Office for National Statistics, as evidence that the EU relies more on Britain than Britain does on the rest of the EU.
The ONS said Britain exported £11.1billion of goods to Europe in November, compared with £12.2billion to the rest of the world.

The report also showed that while exports to Europe remained subdued, Britain bought record amounts of goods from EU countries – helping to prop up their economies.
The difference between imports and exports was valued at around £8.2billion. Ukip MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘The importance of the EU deteriorates with every set of trade figures. Of course they are not going to discriminate against us once we have left.'
David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on the country's EU membership by the end of 2017 – sparking warnings from the pro-Europe camp that quitting would seriously damage the economy.
But Matthew Elliott, from campaign group Vote Leave, said: ‘When we vote to leave we will secure a free trade deal with the EU and these figures show why. We need to take back control over trade policy.'
Not many buildings can melt cars and blow people over, but London's ‘Death Ray' Walkie Talkie certainly can. The ‘deadly' 160-meter tall office tower, officially known as 20 Fenchurch Street, just won the 2015 Carbuncle Cup for worst UK building. We'd feel sorry for the unusually shaped building, but the ‘Death Ray' truly has earned its name—in 2013, the top-heavy glass skyscraper was nicknamed “Walkie-Scorchie” for melting a luxury car on the pavement and setting carpets on fire from reflected glare. Just last month, the building made headlines for creating ferocious wind tunnels that knock pedestrians off their feet. Incredible, isn't it?
The annual Carbuncle Cup is organized by the Building Design (BD) magazine and is awarded to the worst new building in Britain. Readers of BD are invited to nominate their most hated buildings to a jury, chaired by BD editor Thomas Lane, that then determines the short-list of six and the winner. The “oppressive” Woolwich Central development won 2014's Carbuncle Cup.
Walkie Talkie skyscraper, which was completed in April 2014, was announced by BD as this year's winner with the harsh title “It should never have been built.” Designed by Uruguayan architect Rafael Vinoly for a cost of over £200 million, the 27-story Walkie Talkie was criticized by Lane as “an unwelcome party guest” that “crashes into London's skyline.” They added that it was hard to find anything positive to say about the building. Juror and BD architecture critic Ike Ijeh called the tower “a gratuitous glass gargoyle graffitied onto the skyline of London,” while fellow juror and architectural designer Eleanor Jolliffe likened the Walkie Talkie to a “Bond villain tower, as it could melt your car with a solar beam from space.”

The controversial building features a glass concave form that widens as it reaches the top. It's an unusual shape that's drawn criticism not just for its looks, but also for causing unexpected mayhem in the streets of London. While it was still under construction, the Walkie Talkie earned the nickname Death Ray for scorching cars, setting carpets on fire, and smoldering front doors. The concave shape was found to have channeled the sun's rays into concentrated ultra-hot light beams, similar to the way a magnifying glass works. Developers responded by outfitting the skyscraper with sunshades. Recently, however, the Walkie Talkie made news again for creating violent wind draughts at street-level.
The Walkie Talkie beat out nominations that included the Woodward Hall development in North Acton, the Whittle Building at the University of Cambridge, the Waltham Forest YMCA building, Southampton's City Gateway project and the Parliament House tower in Lambeth.

After planning to launch into the Gujarat assembly elections all cylinders blazing and then at one point abandoning the fight altogether, the Aam Aadmi Party has finally decided to make it a limited foray.
There are a number of reasons why AAP will enter the electoral fray in Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah's home state. But trying to form the next government in the state is not one of them. And in doing that, the party is showing signs of wisening up and learning from its recent electoral losses.
AAP has its eyes set on the next Lok Sabha polls and assembly polls in states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka that precede the general election. To begin with, the AAP brass simply wants to keep its flock together for that. The local unit of the party has been raring for a fight for more than three years and not contesting the elections would mean disappointing the cadres in Gujarat to the extent of losing a sizeable portion. Two, AAP's bargaining position vis-à-vis other parties in a future coalition will be decided by the number of seats it can win in the Lok Sabha elections.
Though the party has always positioned itself as equidistant from both the BJP and the Congress, AAP will be willing to join an anti-BJP coalition in 2019 or whenever the next Lok Sabha polls take place. And the indication for that came from none other than Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal at Congress leader Manish Tewari's book launch last fortnight.
“Whether opposition parties will come together or not, that is arithmetic. That is also necessary in electoral politics but a churning is taking place. The coming election will not be opposition versus BJP. It will be BJP versus the rest of the country,” Kejriwal said at the function where they shared the stage with BJP's Yashwant Sinha and Tewari. AAP and its tallest leader are beginning to realise and profess that politics is the art of the possible.
In the realm of the possible, AAP believes it can cash in on the anti-incumbency against the ruling BJP there, target specific groups -- like the Dalits, Muslims, farmers and Patidars -- and poll enough votes to stay in contention for being a national party. To be able to focus on Gujarat, it has decided to stay away from Himachal Pradesh, where elections will be held in November.
AAP is in power in Delhi, the principal opposition in Punjab and polled 6.3% votes in Goa in February. (To be recognised as a national party by the Election Commission, a party needs to have secured six per cent of the votes polled in four states – whether in the general election or the assembly election – and won four seats to the House of the People). Though it won't change much on the ground unless it wins seats in the assembly, unlike Goa where it drew a naught, crossing the magic mark of six% will help AAP cross a psychological barrier and serve as a booster for its cadres. AAP leaders privately admit that the debacles in Goa and the Delhi municipal polls earlier this year saw several party volunteers leave.
So far, AAP has just declared 21 seats in the state where it will field candidates. The eventual number will be close to 50. AAP strategists feel the party can dent the Congress and try and wean away some of the anti-BJP votes from the party that has played opposition in Gujarat's bipolar polity for over two decades now. The Congress has already begun accusing AAP of dividing the anti-incumbency vote in Gujarat with its state in-charge Ashok Gehlot saying in a recent interview that AAP should withdraw from the contest and not divide Congress votes in the country's interest.
But AAP rejects the suggestion as undemocratic. “The Congress did not act as an active opposition for 22 long years and allowed the state to slip under the BJP,” says Harshil Nayak, party spokesperson. “AAP's support in the last two years to issues concerning the farmers and marginalised communities and the agitations we organised have brought the anger against the BJP to a boil.”
“Contesting Gujarat will help the AAP shed its image of an urban governance party. If it feels it can attract certain sections of voters, it should test the waters in the elections,” says political analyst Abhay Dubey of Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a Delhi-based advocacy group. Two surveys by CSDS have pointed out that the Congress is closing in on the BJP but the gap has not gone down drastically except among the Muslims and Dalits.

SINGAPORE, March 9 (Reuters) - Acidifying oceans caused by rising carbon dioxide levels are cutting the shell weights of tiny marine animals in a process that could accelerate global warming, a scientist said on Monday.
William Howard of the University of Tasmania in Australia described the findings as an early-warning signal, adding the research was the first direct field evidence of marine life being affected by rising acidity of the oceans.
Oceans absorb large amounts of CO2 emitted by humankind through the burning of fossil fuels. The Southern Ocean between Australia and Antarctica is the largest of the ocean carbon sinks.
But scientists say the world's oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb more planet-warming CO2, disrupting the process of calcification used by sea creatures to build shells as well as coral reefs.
Laboratory experiments had earlier predicted these impacts.
Howard and co-author Andrew Moy, also of the University of Tasmania, studied the shells of tiny amoeba-like animals called foraminifera in the Southern Ocean and compared the shell weights to data from sediment core records dating back 50,000 years.
Their findings, which appear in the latest issue of Nature Geoscience, show shell weights of modern-day foraminifera falling between 30 and 35 percent.
"The big challenge will be how do we scale up this kind of change to understand what it means for the ecosystem. And to be honest, we don't know yet," they told Reuters.
The implications for climate change were clearer, they said.
CARBON TRANSFER
Foraminifera, which live on the ocean's surface, play a major role in trapping CO2 and transporting it to the ocean depths where it can be locked away for decades or more.
Disrupting this process could accelerate climate change.
Foraminifera, they said, comprise a significant proportion of all the carbonate shell material produced in the ocean.
"Their presence and production helps facilitate the sinking of organic matter from the surface layers of the ocean into the deep ocean," said Howard, project leader of the ocean acidification team at the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre.
"That translates into the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere into the deep ocean. If these organisms are not calcifying as much it may translate into a reduction in the carbon transfer from the atmosphere."
Oceans are alkaline and Howard said that a century ago, oceans had a pH of 8.2, with a pH of 0 being battery acid and 13 being household bleach.
Oceans were now just under 8.1, they said.
"We've already changed the pH of the ocean by about 0.1. At these levels this represents about a 30 percent increase in the acidity of the oceans," Howard said.
"Anything that makes a shell is going to have a hard time making that shell."
The big challenge was understanding the ocean's response to climate change and what happens to ecosystems. The Southern Ocean was one of the first areas scientists will see this kind of shift, Howard said, in part because it is a major carbon sink.
"There's no question acidification is going to affect every part of the ocean because every part of the ocean is taking up CO2 from human-made emissions," they said. (Editing by Paul Tait)
Wow, just... wow. I opened the door this morning to a package from Scotland containing the most amazing things! My Santa definitely put in effort to find things I would like, getting things from my wishlist as well as some other amazing stuff. The thing that first caught my eye was, of course, the big bag of Reese's Pieces (the love of my life...), then, secondly, that everything was wrapped in tartan wrapping paper! How wonderful :) I got a Beetlejuice bookmark (with genuine film cell!) and The Handbook of the Recently Deceased - two things that I have been lusting after for a while. Then came Tim Burton playing cards (many a drinking game will be had) and two really great shotglasses to go in my collection! I collect shotglasses from around the world so the Nessie one is particularly fitting :) My Santa also stalked my profile and found out that I like Star Trek, so included their own prints along with the package. They're going up on my wall! Thank you!!! xx
It makes increasingly perfect sense why President-elect Donald Trump wants congressional term limits. And it makes just as much sense why their putative Republican helpmates on the Hill will overlook short-term political expediency and take the lead in rebuffing him.
Atop Trump's “drain the swamp” campaign platform was the promise to push restrictions on time served in the House or Senate, although he's not specified how short the maximum congressional tenure should be.
“We're going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren't happy about, but we're putting on term limits,” they said during their “60 Minutes” interview right after the election. “We're doing a lot of things to clean up the system.”
It's easy to understand the first, obvious reason this would remain high on their stated agenda: The public overwhelmingly supports the idea. Two weeks before Election Day, the Rasmussen Reports poll found 74 percent support for congressional term limits among likely voters, with the rest evenly split between opposed and undecided.
A possible secondary rationale comes with an implication of disingenuousness, but evidence to support such speculation grows by the day: Trump wants to increase the strength and power of the executive branch to another new height, and weakening the legislative branch through term limits is one way to accomplish that.
The candidate who accepted the GOP nomination with a dark vision of the nation's future, and the declaration that “I alone can fix it,” is now transitioning toward the White House on the same path of extreme personal self-confidence coupled with extraordinary, robust use of presidential authority.
After their courtesy calls on the top Republican leaders a day after claiming victory, Trump largely retreated from public view, so their brief infomercial before Thanksgiving outlining their first 100 days' agenda took on outsized importance. And it was remarkable as much for its medium (YouTube, not a news conference) as for its messages, both stated and unstated.
The Capitol's inhabitants were justifiably thunderstruck by the two words they never heard — “Congress” and “legislation.” Rather than pay so much as lip service to the idea of legislators collaborating with them from the start, Trump spoke about spending their first winter in Washington entirely on executive action.
Never say never?
Some of what they described went beyond undoing many of President Barack Obama's executive orders, which the GOP Congress is fully behind. Most notably, they said thousands of their administration's officials won't be allowed to lobby for five years afterward and won't ever be permitted to advocate on behalf of foreign governments. Such decrees will never get enforced unless Congress writes them into law.
Lawmakers who have been in office for more than a few years are bound to acquire a serious understanding of this sort of balance of powers — not to mention a rooting interest in preserving, if not advancing, the authorities Congress has for making policies and overseeing those assigned to execute them.
But if they arrive knowing they can't stay for long (three two-year terms for House members and a pair of six-year terms for senators are the proscriptions most often advocated) there will be much less incentive for members to lean into their institutional prerogatives.
And Congress will have much less of the collective knowledge and expertise required to outlast an assertive president, outmaneuver an institutionalized federal bureaucracy or outsmart the legion of lobbyists who will undeniably be able to find a way to keep lurking in the muddy eddies of Trump's dried-out quagmire.
To cite just one current example, it's tough to imagine House Budget Chairman Tom Price having any remotely plausible hope of steering a reconstruction of the federal budget process to completion in the next Congress — except that, as a GOP member of congress from Georgia for a dozen years, he's had time to develop unrivaled expertise in the system's fatally flawed current mechanics and unequaled knowledge of the political rivalries and special interest crosscurrents complicating any revamp. (Price will unveil their plan on Wednesday.)
Congressional terms may only be limited by constitutional amendment, the Supreme Court has ruled, meaning bipartisan two-thirds majorities in the House and Senate would need to coalesce behind a plan and then three-quarters of the states would need to endorse it.
Such a level of support doesn't exist. The most prominent opponent, for starters, is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's ruled out any collaboration with Trump on the matter.
‘They're called elections…'
“We have term limits now,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters Nov. 10. “They're called elections. And it will not be on the agenda in the Senate.”
Speaker Paul D. Ryan professes support for term limits, although they told reporters Nov. 17 he'll leave the matter in the hands of the Judiciary Committee, without any pressure from him. (He's also not made any promises about curtailing their own time as a Wisconsin member of congress.)
It's been two decades since Congress last considered the question, soundly turning aside a constitutional amendment even at a time when the anti-incumbent fervor of the electorate had spawned momentum for term limits in dozens of states.
In the House, the proposal was the only one among the 10 “Contract with America” planks to suffer outright rejection, even after that very GOP manifesto for revamping the way Congress works helped end four decades of Democratic rule. The proposal came up 61 votes short of the supermajority necessary in 1995 because 40 Republicans (predictably, mainly from the ranks of the long-tenured) voted against it.
Senate Republicans tried to revive the issue the next year, but gave up when they could muster only 58 votes in favor of bringing the constitutional change to the floor.
For opponents of term limits, a really important argument for their cause lies just beneath those outcomes. Those tally sheets provide evidence that, as McConnell says, the natural political cycle results in plenty of congressional turnover.
Thanks to retirements, defeats, resignations or departures for other reasons, next year's 115th Congress will open with just 84 lawmakers (16 percent of the total membership) who were in the House or Senate as recently as that 104th Congress.
Tom Callos is a martial arts business and school management teacher, coach, and consultant. They help martial arts teachers and other professionals.
 They are also the stepfather of Keenan Cornelius, and they are also BJ Penn's first ever BJJ instructor. At the age of 17, BJ Penn began training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after being introduced to it by their neighbor, Tom Callos who had put up fliers in local gyms looking for people to train with, and B.J.'s father Jay Dee Penn had called Callos and said their boys were interested. Callos then taught B.J. and their brother what they knew.
Penn talked about how they met Callos:
When I was 17 years old ( and not doing much but drinking and fighting down at the beach) this man (Tom Callos) moved in two houses down the road from my house. They had done a couple Gracie Jiu Jitsu lessons in Northern California and wanted to have some grappling partners to wrestle with at the local rec center… I didn't want to do it but Tom persisted and I finally went to the rec center and Tom choked me and arm locked me… the rest is history..
Callos recently wrote on their Facebook page about why lifelong martial artists like themselves shouldn't be afraid to take off their black belts in their respective arts and wear a white belt gain when starting BJJ:
“John Geyston suggested I might write a piece on high ranking black belts, like yours truly, putting on a white belt again and studying a no (expletive deleted) art like Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. They said some “high profile business consultant” (read: idiot) in the martial arts “industry” told them they were committing business suicide by wearing their white or blue belt in front of their students, instead of their “masters belt.”
Well, frankly and with all due respect, what a stupid-assed, lame brain, idiotic, moronic, and down-right foolish thing to say –and thank you John for being one of the guys who aren't so wrapped up in their own ego that they can't go out there and enjoy one of the most beautiful martial arts in the world –practiced by some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure to get tortured by.
The martial arts industry, all too often, has its head planted either firmly in the sand –or right up its own behind.
Mr Morrison did not go into specifics when asked what plans or policies they would like to introduce as treasurer, though they said their focus would be on jobs creation, not additional taxes.

"Taxes are a means to an end, there's not some holy grail in the tax system," they said.
"Jobs is the outcome I'm looking for, that's what I want and I want to see that we have the resources to support the services.
"The best thing you can do for people who may be falling behind in our economy - and I've had that responsibility in social services for almost the past year - the best thing I can do to help them is to have a growing economy [rather] than destroy our social security system."
Mr Morrison said it was their "job to inspire others with confidence in the economy".
"We have to acknowledge the work that [former treasurer] Joe [Hockey] did do, but the task for us is to really ignite Australians' aspirations," they said.

I am a stay-at-home girlfriend. When my boyfriend goes off to work, I spend my days cooking, cleaning our two-bedroom Greenpoint apartment and trying to look good for them when they come home. I never planned on this lifestyle; my corporate job of four years was outsourced in October when we were already living together. What was a matter of convenience before is now a matter of financial survival — while I've always been someone who's really into keeping their boyfriend happy (that's how I was raised), it's now my primary occupation after job-seeking. I'm not alone. I was actually the third of my female friends living with their boyfriend to wind up out of work, and all of us, to some degree, adhere to stereotypically Stepfordish rules to keep our relationships afloat and ourselves sane. Here are mine:
Don't sleep in: When my boyfriend wakes up at 6, I get up with him, turn on the television, chat with him, and try to make them a simple breakfast, maybe scrambled eggs or just cereal and juice. It's bad enough that they know I'm home all day, no need for them to think I sleep until noon.
Keep the place clean: When I was working, the cleaning usually didn't get done until Saturday — now it's part of my daily to-do list. Like any other busy person getting ready in the morning, they throw their clothes on the floor, takes a shower and leaves the floor wet etc. Why leave it there for them to take care of when they get home? To be spiteful? I'd much rather pick up behind them — I don't want to live in a messy home either. It also gives me something to do when my brain reaches its resumé-submission limit.
Cook or order dinner every night: I happen to love cooking. I was making dinner at least three to four times a week when I was still employed, except then I could actually afford to go to the butcher and get the best racks of ribs. Now that I'm not working, it's only right to keep the meals on the table. If you don't cook, order something. Put a cold beer or glass of wine on the table along with it. My boyfriend loves it. He's always grateful for any and all of the little things I do; it never gets too predictable because I try to do something new every time.
Keep yourself up: I can't afford to go to the hair and nail salon once a week as I did when I was employed. Those $60 Brazilians every month are definitely out of the question. I learned how to do my hair myself, went to Duane Reade for an at-home wax kit (proceed with caution!!) and have my friends give me manicures. I even turn on the Health channel and do some of the cheesy morning aerobics. There are plenty of ways to look good on a budget and I have made it my mission to find every single one. My trick to keeping my actual clothing hot and inexpensive is actually fairly simple; I wear things that are totally out of season. If I'm at home, I'll throw on a pair of denim shorts and a tank top or a tube top with jeans and flip flops. Stay covered when you need to leave the house, otherwise pretend everyday is a 90 degree day.
Pamper him. One of my fellow SAHGs buys their boyfriend's favorite chocolate milk and puts in the freezer (because that's the way they like it) for them to find when they get home from work. I always have beer or whiskey ready for my boyfriend, and when it gets colder outside, I'll mix a warm cocktail, which he's a big fan of. Needless to say, the surprise doesn't always have to be of the alcoholic variety but a nice treat while dinner is cooking is always a great way to keep them happy.
Sexy Time: Everyone knows there is nothing more important in a relationship than that special time between the sheets. I have eight to nine hours everyday to send out my resumés and clean and make dinner, by the time they come home from work I am well rested. Frankly, there's no real reason (time of the month aside) why I shouldn't be ready and willing when they are. I try very hard to keep my boyfriend happy and this is a key part of doing so.
Leave the house: To stay sane, I have to get out of the house at some point everyday or I go completely crazy. Whether it's to go to the grocery store, take a walk around the block or go daytime boozing with one of my unemployed friends. My friends and I go boozing at least 1-2 times a week and it is FANtastic. There ‘s nothing better than going to a restaurant, sharing a couple of appetizers and a bottle of wine (or two) with another unemployed girlfriend. The lunch specials at a lot of NYC restaurants are quite inexpensive. You can even spring for a whole meal if you feel like it. If you're not the booze enthusiast I am, enjoy a great meal with a friend. Getting “me” time outside of the apartment is so important. I am aware that a large part of my unemployment schedule is based on keeping my boyfriend happy, so having time to myself away from the confines of my living room really makes my own life better.
All in all, I think being unemployed has made us closer. They get a clean house and dinner, and being unable to go out all the time has forced us to spend more time together. If there's one thing I'm sure he'd like to change it is the way I cling to them when they get home. After spending a large part of the week talking only to myself, having them walk through the door ready to talk about something other than toilet cleaner is really exciting to me. It makes them crazy.
I'm positive some people reading this will assume I'm a brainwashed and battered woman, and I can't say I'm all that concerned. The thing is, even though I've gotten the whole domestic thing down to a science, the idea of being an actual housewife is not at all appealing. I still fully intend to have a career of my own. Until I land that new job, I'm doing the best job I can as a stay-at-home girlfriend.

As my colleague Dr. Tom Crouch referenced in a previous post, our nation is currently in the midst of commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the American Civil War (or sesquicentennial for you Latin fans). While other branches of the Smithsonian, such as the National Museum of American History and National Portrait gallery, have a wide depth of artifacts and images with which they can share stories from the time period, the National Air and Space Museum has far fewer relevant items in its collection. We do, however, have some of the most surprising Civil War artifacts in the entire Institution. Not only does the Museum preserve Thaddeus Lowe's “double telescope,” but the Museum's Archives Department preserves a set of drawings containing plans for the most marvelous of contraptions – the Confederate helicopter.
The American Civil War brought about great advances in the use of technology in warfare. Balloons, railroads, ironclad ships, and even a submarine were demonstrated throughout the conflict, and new ideas were constantly being thought up and tried on the battlefield. Some ideas were more exotic than others, such as the one thought of by William C. Powers. In 1862, most of the ports of the Southern states were completely blockaded by Union naval forces, choking off much-needed supplies and commerce. William C. Powers was an architectural engineer living in Mobile, Alabama, and personally saw the effects of the Northern blockade. Powers knew that the southern states did not have enough ships to break the blockade with naval power, and going through the blockade was full of risks. William Powers saw another way to crush the blockade – attack it from the air.
Using their engineering skills, Powers began drafting plans for a machine that could lift off and propel itself through the air to attack Union ships. Although balloons were being effectively used for observation, they lacked directional control and could not lift enough weight to make an effective bomber. Powers drew upon the work of other famous engineers, such as Archimedes and da Vinci, and employed Archimedean screws for lift and thrust, all powered by a steam engine. The engine was located in the middle of the craft, and used two smokestacks, which can be seen in the drawings. Two Archimedean screws on the sides gave the helicopter forward thrust, similar to how a propeller works on a ship in water, and two mounted vertically in the helicopter gave it lift. A rudder was added to the rear of the craft in order to provide steering. The drawings below show these Archimedean screws represented by the snaking line that runs across the page.

Drawing of the side view of the car and vertical shafting showing details of the steam engine including the boiler, cylinder, and crankshaft for William C. Powers' experimental aircraft.
After drafting their plans, Powers set out to make a small model and then a full-size mockup. Although they had some success creating the small model, as can be seen below, limited resources and lack of support prevented the idea from ever leaving the drawing board. Family lore also says that fear prevented the idea from getting off the ground. When the drawings were donated to the Museum, family members stated that they were hidden during the war to prevent them from falling into Union hands. It was said that a full size example was never created for fear that it would be captured by the Union, mass produced, and used to rain destruction on the Confederate armies and cities throughout the South.

Although the laws of aerodynamics were not on the side of William C. Powers or their helicopter, they do reveal an interesting aspect of the technological advances which came about as a result of the Civil War. Powers even stumbles upon a building method which would be resurrected later on to manufacture airships and even bombers.In the drawing shown below, it is clear that the “hull” of the Powers aircraft would have been constructed using a lattice approach, similar to that used in the British Vickers Wellington Bomber. This provides incredible strength without adding lots of weight.Perhaps Mr. Powers was just ahead of their time….
Among progressive friends and colleagues of mine, there seems to be a consensus that the longer the Republican presidential primary continues the better for progressives. The idea is that Republican infighting weakens the ultimate nominee and exposes just how radical all of the GOP candidates are. As the domino theory goes, that will help more Americans see the ugly truth about what the Republican Party really is, which will subsequently convince more Americans to vote against the GOP, which will eventually force the GOP to moderate its politics.
Straightforward as this hypothesis is, I don't buy it — I believe the longer the Republican primary battle continues, the more the GOP's most extreme proposals are given a mainstream platform, the more their ideas are granted public credibility and the more conservative propaganda is invisibly woven into our most basic political assumptions. In other words, I believe in the Goldwater Principle, which suggests that while the eventual nominee may fail to win the cycle's general election, the elongated nomination contest -- with its news cycle dominance and hardcore ideological edge -- will help permanently shift the supposed mainstream “center” of our public debate to the fringe right.

Consider the heated attacks Mitt Romney's campaign is now lobbing at Rick Santorum in the run-up to Super Tuesday. By calling the former Pennsylvania senator "Big Labor's favorite senator," the effort aims to paint the viciously anti-union Santorum as nothing short of the flesh-and-blood reincarnation of Paul Wellstone. Romney is clearly hoping that such a portrayal will spur a GOP voter backlash, and sensational headlines across the country spur their framing on. The result is a troubling ripple effect that could transcend a single election.
Laugh all you want at the absurdity of calling Santorum union workers' best friend, and tell yourself that it all will teach average Americans how ridiculous the GOP is, but in reality, it's not funny and will most likely have the opposite effect: It will probably help the larger effort to undermine the once-undebatable idea of what "pro-labor" fundamentally means.
As the framing of the Republican primary debate argues, it no longer means consistently backing minimum wage increases; consistently opposing corporate-written "free" trade deals; supporting budgets that let the Labor Department enforce labor laws; opposing so-called right-to-work laws; or even casting a majority of one's legislative votes in favor of unions' agenda. It means the opposite: a senator who has repeatedly voted against minimum wage increases, for job-killing trade agreements, against budgets that adequately fund labor-law enforcement, and against unions' stated priorities a whopping 88 percent of the time. It also means a presidential candidate who is actively campaigning in support of a national "right to work" law.
While this particular -- and particularly ridiculous -- definition of "pro-labor" might not fully stick in the American psyche, it does have a longer-term psychological effect, especially since so much media attention is focused on it. It's part of a larger process that, over the years, gradually shifts our assumptions and definitions to the right -- a process that makes Santorum into "Big Labor's favorite senator" and by comparison, genuinely pro-labor lawmakers into wild-eyed leftists. Indeed, with Santorum depicted as Paul Wellstone, today's conservative Democrats who sometime votes with unions are suddenly at risk of being seen as European socialists, and progressive Democrats who are actually pro-labor are almost certain to be reimagined as Marxist revolutionaries -- even though nothing could be further from the truth. Meanwhile, the momentary argument over whether Santorum is pro- or anti-union bleeds out into the larger campaign to reset the political center and define both the terms "liberal" and "conservative" as something farther to the right than they were even a few years ago.
On that latter point, notice the response from the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO (emphasis added):
Rick Bloomingdale, president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO, remembered trying to schedule meetings with Santorum, but always being passed over to their staff. After appealing to the Republican Senator's aides on the labor issue of the day, Bloomingdale said their office would receive a letter stating the senator “was opposing you on whatever that issue was.” “His thing was, ‘I won without you.' He's an arrogant guy, they think he's right and everyone else is wrong,” Bloomingdale said. “Calling them a labor supporter would be similar to calling Mitt Romney a conservative. They're both ridiculous.”
So now, not only is the media forwarding the idea that Santorum is pro-labor, but labor leaders themselves are suggesting archconservative Mitt Romney is not actually conservative! For the national conservative movement, that means the whole affair -- regardless of whom it helps in a given election -- is a victory in the larger war to move America to the right.

This is precisely why the longer the GOP primary and these vernacular-changing skirmishes take center stage, the better it is for conservatives, and the worse it is for the progressive movement. Sure, an elongated primary battle may (and I stress may) minimally help President Obama's reelection campaign. But over the long haul, it threatens to change the very parameters of our political discourse -- and that will have consequences for many elections to come.

There has been a suicide attack at the gates of a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, where the new president was staying.
A BBC reporter says at least seven people died in the attack, including the two bombers who targeted the hotel.
President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who has been based at the Jazeera hotel near the airport, was unharmed.
The al-Qaeda-aligned group al-Shabab said it had carried out the attack.
On Tuesday, the group said the president's election, which is the latest step to end decades of war, was organised by the "enemies of Somalia".
It was the first time for years that a president has been chosen on Somali soil.
"This atrocious attack comes only two days after a milestone vote where the Somali parliament overwhelmingly and transparently elected Mr Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as president, giving to Somalia a renewed hope for a better future," UN envoy to Somalia Augustine Mahiga said in a statement.
"Such attempts to push the country back into chaos and violence will not deter the Somali people's determination to move forward."

"There has been a blast around the hotel where the president was. The president is safe. All the people who were inside the hotel are safe," Col Ali Houmed, a spokesperson for the African Union force in the country, known as Amisom, told the AFP news agency.
Who is Hassan Sheikh Mohamud? Image caption MPs voted convincingly for Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in a run-off vote on Monday Born in central Hiran region in 1955
From the major Hawiye clan
Married, speaks Somali and English
Linked to al-Islah, Somalia's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood
Studied engineering at the Somali National University and became a lecturer in 1981
Obtained an MBA from Bhopal University
Stayed in Somalia during the civil war, working as a consultant with non-governmental groups, UN bodies and on several peace initiatives
Helped set up the Simad University in 1999

One witness told the BBC Somali Service that two militants parked a vehicle near the hotel and walked towards the building.
One man blew themselves up at the gate as the second man ran into the hotel firing a gun which wounded a police officer, they said.
The second attacker was shot dead before there was a further explosion.
The BBC's Ibrahim Aden in Mogadishu says two Somali soldiers were killed in the first blast and two civilians were killed in the ensuing shoot out.
In a statement, Amisom said one of its soldiers had died and three others were injured.
Six civilians were also wounded and are being treated in hospital for bullet wounds, our reporter says.
The blasts took place as President Mohamud was holding a press conference in the Jazeera Hotel with visiting Kenyan Foreign Minister Sam Ongeri.
"When we just started the press conference there was a suicide bombing outside and gunshots which were heard from outside the hotel," a woman inside the building, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.
"We could see them from the window," they said.
The Kenyan foreign ministry confirmed that there was an attack whilst Mr Ongeri was delivering a "goodwill message" to the new president.
"The meeting however went on successfully after the thwarted terrorist attack with Minister Ongeri and their entourage are expected back to the country later this evening," the statement said.
Kenya sent troops to Somalia last year, saying that it wanted al-Shabab defeated because the militants threatened its security.
Kenyan soldiers have since joined the Amisom force in the country, boosting its numbers to nearly 18,000.
Just over a year ago, al-Shabab was largely driven out of Mogadishu by African Union forces and Somali government troops.
But militants still stage occasional attacks in the city.
Since the overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991, Somalia has seen clan-based warlords, Islamist militants and its neighbours all battling for control.
American hunters are emerging as a strong and growing threat to the survival of African lions, with demand for trophy rugs and necklaces driving the animals towards extinction, a coalition of wildlife organisations has said.
Demand for hunting trophies, such as lion skin rugs, and a thriving trade in animal parts in the US and across the globe have raised the threat levels for African lions, which are already under assault because of conflicts with local villagers and shrinking habitat.
"The African lion is a species in crisis," said Jeff Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. "The king of the jungle is heading toward extinction, and yet Americans continue to kill lions for sport."
Two-thirds of the lions hunted for sport were brought to America over the last 10 years, a report released by the coalition said.
The organisations, which include IFAW, the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, Born Free and Defenders of Wildlife, called on the White House to ban the import of lion trophies and parts by listing the animals as endangered species.
The number of wild African lions has fallen sharply in the last 100 years, the organisations said. A century ago, as many as 200,000 roamed across Africa. Now, by some estimates, fewer than 40,000 remain in the wild; others put the figure for survivors at 23,000, and they have vanished from 80% of the areas where they once roamed.
Lions have become extinct in 26 countries. Only seven countries – Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe – are believed to contain more than 1,000 lions each, according to the Panthera conservation group – which is not part of the coalition making the appeal.
The single biggest threat by far to the animals' survival is humans, though not necessarily western hunters. "It is just the very, very widespread killing of lions, mostly in a conflict situation, by anyone who is trying to farm livestock in Africa and finds it very difficult to co-exist with lions," said Luke Hunter, the executive vice-president of Panthera.
There is also a lot of pressure on lion habitats with wilderness areas shrinking to build roads – such as the controversial highway across the Serengeti – or to make room for agriculture.
But the report by the wildlife coalition, filed with the White House on Tuesday, said western hunters were a growing danger to the lions' survival.
Between 1999 and 2008, 64% of the 5,663 lions that were killed in the African wild for sport ended up being shipped to America, it said. It also said the numbers had risen sharply in those 10 years, with more than twice as many lions taken as trophies by US hunters in 2008 than in 1999. In addition to personal trophies, Americans are also the world's biggest buyers of lion carcasses and body parts, including claws, skulls, bones and penises. In the same years, the US imported 63% of the 2,715 lion specimens put up for sale.
For some countries, including Tanzania, Zambia, Namibia and Mozambique, hunting for sport was the main threat to the lions' existence. But even in countries which did not attract large numbers of tourists on hunting trips, the practice was taking a growing toll.
The conservationists noted that hunters' penchant for bagging a male lion risked wiping out entire prides. The loss of the alpha male could set off a struggle for supremacy among the survivors that could lead to further deaths of adult male lions, or male cubs seen as potential threats.
A hunting ban, the conservationists said, would reduce that threat by taking Americans out of the game. It's one of a range of threats to the survival of the species, said Teresa Telecky, director of wildlife for Humane Society International. "But what is most certainly true is that of all the threats to the African lion, the one we can best address here in this country is their import."
Flocken noted that all of the other big cats are protected – jaguars, leopards and tigers. "African lions are the only ones left out there," they said.
However, other wildlife experts argued that a total hunting ban was a "nuclear option". They said responsible hunting could in some cases help conserve populations by maintaining wilderness areas. Existing US and international regulations, such as the Cites conventions against trafficking in endangered species, could also be reinforced to protect lions, they said.
"If you remove hunting, the very real risk is that you force African governments to generate revenue from that land and the obvious thing is cattle and crops which just wipe out habitats," said Hunter.
WASHINGTON, DC–A study released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association reveals that 98 percent of Americans support the use of mass transit by others.
"With traffic congestion, pollution, and oil shortages all getting worse, now is the time to shift to affordable, efficient public transportation," APTA director Howard Collier said. "Fortunately, as this report shows, Americans have finally recognized the need for everyone else to do exactly that."

Of the study's 5,200 participants, 44 percent cited faster commutes as the primary reason to expand public transportation, followed closely by shorter lines at the gas station. Environmental and energy concerns ranked a distant third and fourth, respectively.
Anaheim, CA, resident Lance Holland, who drives 80 miles a day to their job in downtown Los Angeles, was among the proponents of public transit.
"Expanding mass transit isn't just a good idea, it's a necessity," Holland said. "My drive to work is unbelievable. I spend more than two hours stuck in 12 lanes of traffic. It's about time somebody did something to get some of these other cars off the road."

Public support for mass transit will naturally lead to its expansion and improvement, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said.
"With everyone behind it, we'll be able to expand bus routes, create park-and-ride programs, and build entire new Metrolink commuter-rail lines," LACMTA president Howard Sager said. "It's almost a shame I don't know anyone who will be using these new services."
Sager said they expect wide-scale expansion of safe, efficient, and economical mass-transit systems to reduce traffic congestion in all major metropolitan areas in the coming decades.

"Improving public transportation will do a great deal of good, creating jobs, revitalizing downtown areas, and reducing pollution," Sager said. "It also means a lot to me personally, as it should cut 20 to 25 minutes off my morning drive."
The APTA study also noted that of the 98 percent of Americans who drive to work, 94 percent are the sole occupant of their automobile.

"When public transportation is not practical, commuters should at least be carpooling," Collier said. "Most people, unlike me, probably work near someone they know and don't need to be driving alone."
Collier said they hope the study serves as a wake-up call to Americans. In conjunction with its release, the APTA is kicking off a campaign to promote mass transit with the slogan, "Take The Bus… I'll Be Glad You Did."
The campaign is intended to de-emphasize the inconvenience and social stigma associated with using public transportation, focusing instead on the positives. Among these positives: the health benefits of getting fresh air while waiting at the bus stop, the chance to meet interesting people from a diverse array of low-paying service-sector jobs, and the opportunity to learn new languages by reading subway ads written in Spanish.

"People need to realize that public transportation isn't just for some poor sucker to take to work," Collier said. "He should also be taking it to the shopping mall, the supermarket, and the laundromat."
Just now catching up with the Human Birdwings project ? Nice timing. The human flight machine -- built by Jarnos Smeets to rely on a Wiimote and Wildfire S, among other niceties -- has just enjoyed its first moments of liftoff. In essence, the wings were strapped onto a willing Earthling, and as they began to flap their arms... well, it's a sight you need to see to fully appreciate. We'll confess that the "flight" didn't last long, but Jarno themselves told us that it was but a first "test run." Promising? Oh, yes. Head on past the break for the vid.: The project here has been underway since at least August of last year, but we've requested raw footage of the test flight here to further justify concerns. We'll report back shortly!: Shocker, it's fake . And that's that.
Are you going to be having a burger today? Bacon? Cheese? Pickle? How about feces?
I am not being facetious. I am not even being fecetious.
For Digital Trends informs me of a trend that might just have your digits twitching involuntarily.
It seems that a researcher from the alleged Okayama Laboratory in Japan has taken it upon themselves to take the concept of "waste not, want not" to a new and delirious level.
Mitsuyuki Ikeda is clearly not a man who is faint of heart or of stomach. On allegedly being approached by the Tokyo Sewage company, which was concerned that it was in possession of just so much sewage mud, Ikeda digested the problem very carefully.
They poked and prodded at the sewage, actions which revealed that it was rather full of protein, thanks to all the bacteria that was embedded in its sludge.
"Why," they reportedly said to himself, "there is meat in this mud. And there is no murder involved."
So they supposedly set about sucking out the proteins, mixing them in with a reaction enhancer, and slamming them into an exploder--a process that seems to have, well, exploded a poop burger.
The resultant meat is supposedly 63 percent protein. The rest is, well, rat urine, mouse droppings, discarded newspapers, toilet paper, and other tissues. Oh, of course I'm kidding. It is officially described as 25 percent carbohydrates, 3 percent lipids and 9 percent, um, minerals.
As any reasonable human being would, you will be wondering what this poop burger tastes like. Allegedly, with the addition of a little soy protein, it tastes like real meat. The sort you might get at your local Cow's Jr., or wherever it is you gain your sustenance.
You will notice that I have embedded a video that assists you in the visualization of this new culinary trend. You might wonder why this man is using a dismembered finger--last seen in certain videos obtainable online for a fee--in order to indicate the finer elements of their work.
While you consider that, please consider Ikeda's words too. "I admit that few people would be keen to eat it," they said. This is not merely because it supposedly costs between 10 and 20 times what you might pay at Cow's Jr.
Perhaps I've seen too many staged videos lately, but I am still not convinced this experiment is at all real. (Did you notice how many allegedlys and supposedlys I've already slipped in?)
Does it bother you that the narrator so cheerily describes it as a "turd burger"? Does it strike anyone as just a little odd that, at 1:34 into the video, Ikeda reaches into the fridge, on whose door is emblazoned the fine motif: "S--t Burger"?
Of course this could be a mere scientific joke. Of course, it is tempting to believe Digital Trends and all the other media who are reporting this to be real science. And, of course, very soon we'll all be eating excrement anyway, both metaphorically and physically.
But I tried googling this Okayama Laboratory and I got a company that seems to make stents and other medical devices. I did get a result for Okayama University, but there seems to be no trace of a Mitsuyuki Ikeda there. Although I did find a Mitsuyuki Ikeda who works for UNESCO and is very keen on Education for Sustainable Development.
I tried googling just "Mitsuyuki Ikeda" and I got hundreds of results about their alleged poop burger, but only one result for the same UNESCO-employed Mitsuyuki Ikeda.
So, unless the poop-burgering Ikeda or one of their cohorts can contact me now--or, even better, send me a sample--I am of a mind to flush this story out as a load of old artificial meat.
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders in their bid to become President of the United States, NBC News reported.
Gabbard made the announcement on "Meet the Press" Sunday morning and also resigned as Vice Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Just last month, they said they couldn't take sides due to their position with the DNC.
"As a veteran, as a soldier, I've seen firsthand the true cost of war. … As we look at our choices as to who our next Commander-in-chief will be is to recognize the necessity to have a Commander-in-chief who has foresight," they said, adding that it's important to choose a president that "exercises "good judgement" so that "we don't continue to find our selves in these failures that have resulted in chaos in the Middle East and so much loss of life."
[digg-reddit-me]I received an email this morning from Townhall.com entitled, “ObamaCare Equals Government Funded Euthanasia” with the above image. I'm sort of curious why they couldn't have just shown a picture of Obama with a gun to the baby's head. It would have been more effective at getting their message across. But then again, they might be concerned about losing the white male gun owner vote – 'cause after all, It's hard to maintain that Obama is both a liberal pansy (who's the next Hitler and therefore is going to take away your guns) and that they carry a Glock around so they can take out any infants they see.
But I take this email to demonstrate that the right is now stepping up its blizzard of lies about the Democratic health care reform bill over the August recess. Here's some context for the photo:
Everyone knows that nationalized healthcare is a terrible idea but everyday we unearth even more awful details in what is in the proposed government-run plan. A nation of Terri Schiavos with a National Euthanasia Bill? In 2005, a COURT ordered the removal of a feeding Tube from Terri Schiavo. It outraged a nation. If the Government takes over health care, bureaucrats will decide who lives and dies in America. In the name of “creating efficiencies,” they will delay – or deny – treatment to critically ill patients because it costs too much. We will have a NATION of Terri Schiavo's, with a faceless Federal Bureaucracy pulling the plug instead of a Court.! Sound crazy? It happens every day in Great Britain. You can STOP what will in effect be government sponsored euthanasia in America if you ACT NOW. If you care about the Sanctity of Life, the proposed Government Takeover of Health Care is an attack on your values.
It's quite interesting that Town Hall would bring up Terri Schiavo – the pinnacle of right-wing overreach that helped alienate libertarians from the Republican camp – and that led the public to near unprecedented levels of agreement over the matter. 62% of Americans favored removing the feeding tube – and 82% of Americans believed that Congress and the President should have stayed out of the matter. Yet Town Hall – speaking only to its base – sees Schiavo as a rallying cry. And not just to their base – they claim that the removal of the feeding tube, “outraged a nation.” I wonder what it accomplishes to lie to your base and tell them that they are the real majority, aside from radicalizing them and alienating them from the American system.
But getting back to the substance of what they are claiming, they bring up a repeated right-wing canard – that:
If the Government takes over health care, bureaucrats will decide who lives and dies in America. In the name of “creating efficiencies,” they will delay – or deny – treatment to critically ill patients because it costs too much.
So many inaccuracies – as, to start, the Democratic health care reform doesn't lead the government to take over health care. At worst, it would lead to a government-provided health insurance. And any health insurance – private or public – will deny treatment on occasion due to expense. The problem with our status quo is that rationing occurs both by cost – depending on what insurance plan you have and by health insurance company bureacrats whose job it is to deny as many treatments as possible and/or to rescind your policy if they can't deny the treatments. That sounds a lot less like rationing and more like a war that health insurance companies are waging against the sick of America – a war in which their goal is to maximize their profits regardless of the cost to society or their paying customers.
As to the Democratic health care reforms endorsing government-funded abortion and euthanasia, I truly wonder who actually buys this load of crap. Clearly, it is an attempt by Town Hall to manufacture outrage – but who is stupid enough to believe this? Too many people, I'm sure.

Last Thursday (April 11), Reebok publicly announced their severing of the endorsement relationship with rapper Rick Ross. The announcement followed public protests outside Reebok retail stores by women's rights groups—including UltraViolet—after Ross' lyrics on Rocko's “U.O.E.N.O.” were interpreted to suggest rape. Following two dismissals of the interpretation of the song, Ross was formally let go on the basis of “values” and their “lack of remorse.” While Ross formally apologized a day later, and wished the shoemaker and apparel brand continued success, there have been no reports of reconciliation.
In a new TMZ report, unnamed sources said to be close to the deal tell the celebrity news and gossip site that Ross stands to lose between $3 and $5 million dollars through the botched deal. Neither Reebok nor Ross have spoken about the financial terms of their now-forfeited agreement, however, TMZ alleges that Ross was receiving pay each time they wore Reebok sneakers.

A distraught Juanita Bonner and their relatives come to the place where their nephew Darryl Green died. The 16- year old body was discovered a few hours ago in the Englewood neighborhood.
"He never goes anywhere. It's just so shocking for this to happen to anyone," said Juanita Green Bonner, victim's aunt.
Their body was found behind a boarded up home in the 6500-block of South Damen in the West Englewood neighborhood.
"It's somebody's child. . .you know, just laying down on that ground, dead. You know, just another life gone," said Eola States, Englewood resident.
Green was found by officers face-down on a set of basement stairs of an abandoned building.
Although witnesses say there were no visible signs of trauma to the body, family members say police told them Darryl had been beaten to death. Investigators at the scene did not confirm any details.
Relatives say the Harper High School student stopped attending class and think they may have been targeted because of their refusal to join a gang.
"Smoking cannabis daily 'is safe when treating chronic pain – but only if you're an experienced user', study finds," says a Mail Online headline. It refers to a study done in Canada to see how safe medical cannabis is for treating chronic pain.
But the results of the study don't mean you should take cannabis if you have chronic pain. They don't show that cannabis helps to reduce pain, and the drug is also illegal in the UK.
In the study, more than 200 people with chronic (non-cancer) pain that had not got better with other treatments were given medical cannabis every day for one year. They were compared with a similar number of people who did not receive cannabis.
The study was designed to look at whether medical cannabis has any side effects – or adverse events – rather than its effect on pain. It found more non-serious adverse events in the cannabis group, but no difference between the two groups for more serious adverse events. It also found lung function test results for those who took cannabis changed very little over one year.
Cannabis use was associated with a small reduction in pain. But this wasn't the main outcome the study was looking at, and people weren't randomly allocated to the cannabis-taking and control groups.
This means it's not able to prove medical cannabis can reduce pain. Any small improvement would also have to be weighed against the increase in minor side effects shown by the study.
The findings are interesting and would benefit from further investigation with a large randomised controlled trial.
Chronic pain can be difficult to manage, and you may need to try different treatment options. Speak with your GP or health professional if you have chronic pain that isn't well controlled.
Where did the story come from?
The study was carried out by researchers from a number of Canadian institutions, including McGill University, the Jewish General Hospital, and the University of British Columbia. Funding was provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
This study has not been reported widely. The body of the Mail Online article provides fair coverage, with a number of quotes from the researchers. However, the headline says "smoking cannabis", when only a quarter of the participants in the cannabis group chose to smoke it. Others used vaporisation or took it by mouth.
Also, it's not reliable to say the drug is "safe". People who took cannabis for pain experienced more adverse effects, albeit not serious ones. The study also can't tell us anything about the possible longer-term effects of medical cannabis on mental or physical health.
What kind of research was this?
This was a prospective cohort study investigating the safety issues of people with chronic pain taking medical cannabis for pain management, compared with a control group of people who did not take cannabis.
A randomised controlled trial would be a better way to investigate this as findings are more likely to be a result of the intervention, rather than other factors or the natural course of the illness, which may have differed between the two groups.
What did the research involve?
Researchers assessed 431 adults from seven clinical centres across Canada who had been experiencing chronic moderate-to-severe non-cancer pain for six months or more. Participants had either not responded to conventional treatments or were considered medically inappropriate.
Potential participants were excluded if they:
were pregnant or breastfeeding
had a history of psychosis
had ischaemic (coronary) heart disease or arrhythmia
had lung disease
The intervention group included 215 people. Sixty-six percent of this group were current cannabis users, 27% were ex-cannabis users, and 7% had never used cannabis.
This group took quality-controlled medical cannabis (12.5% tetrahydrocannabinol). It was taken in whichever way the participant felt the most comfortable – about a quarter smoked it; others used vaporisation or took it by mouth. An upper limit recommendation of 5g was issued (the average taken was 2.5g daily).
Thirty-two percent of the control group (216) were ex-cannabis users, while 68% had never used cannabis.
Adverse events (serious and non-serious) were the main outcome looked at by the researchers. Other outcomes examined were effects on brain (cognitive) function, which was assessed using various memory and intelligence tests, lung function and pain, which was measured on a scale from 1 to 10.
Baseline assessments included addiction screening, neurocognitive testing, urine drug testing and, for the group taking cannabis, blood tests and lung function tests.
All participants were followed for one year, with the cannabis group receiving six clinical visits and three telephone interviews during that period. The control group had two clinical visits and five telephone interviews.
What were the basic results?
Baseline measurements showed the average pain intensity score at the start of the study was significantly higher in the cannabis group (6.6 out of 10) than the control group (6.1 out of 10). A higher number of control participants were using opioids (55% in cannabis group versus 66% in controls) and fewer were men (35% versus 51.2% of the cannabis group).
The rate of serious adverse events was not significantly different between the groups. A total of 13% of the cannabis group reported at least one serious adverse event, compared with 19% in the control group.
The most common serious adverse events in both groups related to the digestive system. For example, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction each affected three people in the cannabis group. These serious adverse events were not considered related to cannabis use.
At least one non-serious adverse event was experienced by 88.4% in the cannabis group and 85.2% in the control group. However, the overall number of non-serious adverse events was significantly higher in the cannabis group (818) than the control group (581).
Non-serious adverse events that were very likely to have been related to cannabis use were:
drowsiness
amnesia
cough
nausea
dizziness
euphoric mood
excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis)
paranoia
Analysis of adverse events against previous cannabis use showed people with a history of cannabis use generally had fewer events overall.
There was no difference between the groups for cognitive results after one year and, in the cannabis group, lung function results showed no significant differences one year on.
The cannabis group saw a significant reduction in average pain intensity by 0.92 points over one year. Both groups saw an improvement in quality of life.
How did the researchers interpret the results?
The researchers concluded that: "This study evaluated the safety of cannabis use by patients with chronic pain over one year. The study found that there was a higher rate of adverse events among cannabis users compared to controls, but not for serious adverse events at an average dose of 2.5g herbal cannabis per day."
They go on to say the study cannot address the safety of medical cannabis for people who have never used the drug. Further studies are also needed to assess the long-term effects of medical cannabis on lung and cognitive functions beyond one year.
Conclusion
This prospective cohort study assessed the safety of medical cannabis for the management of chronic pain. It found a higher number of non-serious adverse events in people who took medical cannabis daily for pain.
Outcomes for serious adverse events and cognitive function were roughly the same as for people who did not take cannabis. Lung function results in the cannabis group remained unchanged over the course of the year-long study.
Though the study was not set up to examine effects on pain itself, it did find an improvement in those who used cannabis. However, this result should be interpreted with considerable caution.
This was not a randomised controlled trial where people were randomly allocated to cannabis use (or not) to balance out any differences between the groups. There may have been existing differences between people who did and did not use cannabis in terms of health and lifestyle factors, or differences in the type, quality and duration of pain.
This means this study is not able to prove medical cannabis can reduce pain. Also, it is difficult to know how meaningful a difference the pain improvement observed – less than 1 point change on a 10-point scale – would have made to individual people. Any small improvement would also have to be weighed against an increase in side effects.
Another limitation of this study is the large number of dropouts – 67 people taking cannabis and 34 controls – who left before the end of the study. Also, as the researchers acknowledge, though they found cannabis had no detrimental effect on brain or lung function, they did not examine this long term.
To summarise, the findings of this study are interesting and would benefit from further investigation in a large randomised controlled trial. However, for now the results do not suggest you should take cannabis if you have chronic pain. Nor does it confirm that cannabis is "safe". Cannabis is a class B drug that is illegal to possess or distribute.
Medications that contain cannabinol – a non-psychoactive substances (e.g. it doesn't get you ‘high') extracted from cannabis - are legal as long as they have been given a licence by the Medicines and Healthcare products Agency (MHRA).
Chronic pain can be difficult to manage and different treatment options may need to be tried. Speak with your GP or the health professional looking after your care if you have poorly controlled chronic pain.
As expected the Rogue One promo campaign is starting to fire up after Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released on Blu-ray/DVD. And what a start it is! 7 months before Gareth Edwards' movie hits theaters, we finally have the first full teaser trailer, and it is awesome. Check it out…
UPDATE!
And here are some screenshots from the trailer (captions by Hard Case):
The opening shot of Felicity Jones' character Jyn Erso in rebel custody at what is presumably the hidden base on Yavin IV…
A wider shot of the base with the rebels as they should be…on the move and ready for a fight.
Now, there's a familiar face. Welcome back, Mon Mothma.

Jyn doing what they do…rebelling against the Empire.
Man, she's really taking those boys down desert scavenger style isn't she? Hmm…I wonder…Anyways, it's great to see the old school stormtroopers back in action in all their cannon fodder glory. Check out the city in the background.
And of course, no rebellion era story would be complete without this classic monstrosity of a ship…
I wonder what kind of package Direct TV offers the Empire? I bet they get a killer discount.
Diego Luna in the war room. Why do I get the feeling he'll be the Poe Dameron of this movie? Must be 'cause they just looks so cool standing there.
Another close-up shot of Felicity Jones…
Sound the alarm…and get to your ships! Nice classic shot with some pilots in their rebel orange on the left…

And finally we have the logo…
UPDATE 2!
Anthony Breznican from EW.com shares more revelations from the trailer. Read their report from the link in the tweet.
Confirmed: The Mon Mothma actor in #RogueOne IS Genevieve O'Reilly, who was cut from Ep.3. https://t.co/2STv3FGyLs pic.twitter.com/G9SAo0WuFJ — Anthony Breznican (@Breznican) April 7, 2016
Them first appearance in Episode III got cut, won't happen this time.
UPDATE 3!
It's just been brought to my attention that they filmed Star Wars #RogueOne in Canary Wharf tube station. Say what! pic.twitter.com/C0AQ94tL8C — Marc ▫️MFC▪️ (@marcfc) April 7, 2016
And now we know where the X-Wing prop from those TMZ leaks ends up in the film.
UPDATE 4!
There has been a lot of speculation that Mendelsohn's character in the film is a Grand Admiral who is either the canon version of Thrawn or a similar character type. However, it has been brought to our attention in the comments section below that the insignia on Mendelsohn's uniform seems to be that of a Fleet Admiral (6 red over 6 blue), not a Grand Admiral like Thrawn which is very different (click here to see an old listing of Imperial insignia).
Grand Admiral Insignia (Legends)
Fleet Admiral Insignia (Legends)
Although the Imperial rank insignia have not all been firmly established yet in canon, with the attention to detail they seem to be paying so far (even to Legends material), I have to wonder if Mendelsohn's character is in fact a Fleet Admiral instead of a Grand Admiral.
I also wanted to note that Wendig's Aftermath had a mysterious Fleet Admiral pulling the strings at the end of the book. I wonder if they and Mendelsohn's character are one and the same? What do you think?
Special thanks to Veritax for the heads-up!
A COUPLE who staged a raunchy wedding photo outside a Cyprus church have waded into a row that saw a ban on Brit weddings in Greece over a similar snap.
Mark and Samantha Simons tied the knot earlier this year - setting up the cheeky shot at sunset.
The Sun 3 The couple said they had taken the cheeky photo for a laugh
After staging a similar photo, their fellow Brits Matthew and Carly Lunn sparked a ban on foreign marriages at a church on the island of Rhodes.
But Lincolnshire mum and dad Mark and Samantha say they don't see what all the fuss is about.
Speaking to the Sun Online, Samantha said the pic was their idea, saying: "I just thought it was a funny photo.
"It's a really funny idea. It's not for the kids or grandkids, but it's a bit of a laugh."
The Sun 3 The couple tied the knot after 11 years together
They added: "It's not one for above the mantelpiece, it's just a light-hearted photo."
Samantha said they were shocked to see the controversy around the other similar photo, shot in Greece, saying: "It's not everybody's cup of tea but it's just a photo."
The mum-of-two said their own mother and grandmother had seen the pic - and thought it was hilarious.
The 29-year-old said the photo had been taken at their destination wedding, with the sun setting and no one around.
The couple had even organised pants for Mark, 34, that read: "Property of Mrs Simons".
FACEBOOK/Carly Lunn 3 The picture of Carly Lunn and new husband Matthew prompted outrage amongst the local community
After 11 years together, the couple finally said "I do" in Cyprus in May this year.
They had got engaged in a horse and cart ride in Bruges at Christmas time in 2015.
But other couples aren't so light-hearted about the x-rated photo, which has seen Bishop Kyrillos ban all foreign weddings from St Paul in Rhodes.
Giorgos Eleftheriou, president of the local Lindos community in Rhodes, made the decision to bar foreign weddings after the snap went viral.
They told The Times: “I have hundreds of soon-to-be brides from Britain and all over the world calling me today in tears because of this decision.
“We are Greek and we cherish our traditions and the sanctity of our religious sites. We cannot allow this disgusting behaviour to prevail.”
Carly, 34, had described the shot as "a brilliant wedding photo" that reflected the couple's cheeky sense of humour - but it could have ruined hundreds more brides' big days.
Richard Sherman, at times insufferable, tried to shake Tom Brady's hand after the Seahawks blew the Super Bowl against the Patriots.
Pretty neat photo.
[UPDATE]: After a moment of soaking it all in, Brady stood up and shook Sherman's hand.

Waterkeepers in the Pacific Northwest win the fight against coal export.
The Cherry Point Aquatic Reserve—Xwe'chieXen in the language of the local Lummi Nation—is home to endangered herring, salmon, orca whales and long-tailed ducks. Bounded by sheer sandy cliffs and cobbled beaches, it covers about seven miles of Washington State's north coast. And it just became bigger. In January, just days before their retirement, Peter Goldmark, Washington's Commissioner of Public Lands, expanded the Cherry Point reserve to include 45 acres of tidelands and aquatic habitat. On the same day, they rejected a requested sublease for a loading dock on the Columbia River in Longview.
Goldmark summed up their day's work in a press release: “These decisions are in the best long-term interest of Puget Sound, the Columbia River and the people of Washington. [The decisions] are informed by years of study and consideration, and represent the best way to protect and conserve our state's waterways.”
But neither of these decisions sounds all that earth-shaking until you know some background. Those 45 acres at Cherry Point had been set aside for the Gateway Pacific Terminal, a coal-transfer facility projected to ship 48 million metric tons of coal per year out of the aquatic reserve. That would have made it the largest coal-export terminal on the West Coast. In turn, the Longview loading-dock had been requested for another proposed coal terminal, slated to ship out an additional 44 million tons of coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming.
To give some perspective: eight million metric tons of coal would pile as high as a 43-story building covering about 19 city blocks. In one day, then, Commissioner Goldmark acted to block the shipment of enough coal to bury an area the size of Manhattan six-feet deep.
Whack-a-Mole Resistance
Perhaps the most notable aspect of the demise of the Cherry Point and Longview proposals was that they were the last two remaining coal-export terminal proposals out of a series of six — all put forward in rapid succession when coal demand in the U.S. plunged after 2008. For Columbia Riverkeeper Brett VandenHeuvel, Goldmark's decision was a culminating victory in a six-year campaign to stop coal trains and terminals from invading the Pacific Northwest.
“It's been a long time,” says Brett with a laugh. “Longview was the first proposed terminal. I have emails on that going back to July 2010.”
As coal-fired power plants were shuttered and the fracking boom brought natural gas prices down over the past decade, coal companies got into a panic to export to Asia, where demand was surging. Export coal prices climbed for almost two years after 2009, and suddenly, coal-terminal proposals were popping up like mushrooms all over the Northwest: Longview, Cherry Point, Coos Bay, Grays Harbour and others. In 2015, American natural-gas-fired plants produced as much electricity as coal for the first time in history.
“I remember early on,” recalls Brett “people were saying to us: ‘This is just whack-a-mole, what you're doing opposing these terminals.' They'd say, ‘Why are you bothering to fight these one at a time? We need some federal energy policy that's going to take care of this.' And our answer all the time was, ‘Well, number one, we don't have a federal energy policy. And we probably aren't going to have one any time soon that is going to protect us from coal exports.'
“Our second argument was that if we were able to knock some of these proposals off, it would buy us time. The markets change, the technology changes, to where there are more renewables available. So some of what seem like impossible fights can, maybe two, three years down the line, be won. If you're able to hold it off, it makes room for more good things, like renewables, to become more competitive.”
And that was pretty much what happened. Pacific Rim coal prices peaked at about $142 per metric ton in 2011 then plunged to $51 per ton by early 2016. Public opposition delayed construction as the market shifted — possibly saving communities and businesses from losing even more money when the market evaporated. The economics of coal-pricing, which thrust major coal producers like Arch and Peabody into Chapter 11 filings, definitely undermined the business case for export, but well-coordinated public opposition also played a major role in keeping terminals out of Washington and Oregon.
What lessons can Waterkeepers and other community leaders take from the Northwest's years of resistance?
The Thin Green Line
Columbia Riverkeeper was one of the organizers of the Power Past Coal (PPC) movement in the Northwest, a coalition that engaged the public regarding the dangers and drawbacks of coal exports. PPC was organized by Columbia Riverkeeper and a few other core organizations, including North Sound Baykeeper, Puget Soundkeeper, Climate Solutions, the National Wildlife Federation and Spokane Riverkeeper. The coalition served as a central support to communities opposing coal — providing facts, updates and strategy.
“We created it very early on with the idea that we would be much stronger if we coordinated our efforts,” says Brett. “Many, many groups, from the coal mines in Montana and Wyoming to the coast, worked together very closely.”
The collaboration was massive. The PPC website notes that 200 regional, community and national organizations were on board, and that “over 55 cities, counties and ports, close to 600 health professionals, 220 faith leaders, 500 local businesses (many from smaller rail-line communities), and over 160 elected officials” had raised concerns about coal exports. The Seattle-based think-tank Sightline Institute has dubbed British Columbia, Washington and Oregon “The Thin Green Line,” – a “geographic accident” that placed the traditionally progressive West Coast between North American fossil-fuel deposits (Powder River coal, Bakken shale oil, Alberta tar sands, numerous natural gas fields) and commodity markets in Asia.
Power Past Coal demonstrated that this thin line could get thick fairly quickly. When asked how the coalition grew to include such broad community support, Brett says that the first factor was “just a huge public outcry against coal export. While there was a lot of organizing, much of it happened organically. People stood up to protect what they love. Strip-mines and coal trains were a very visceral threat that people could see, and understand, and didn't like.”
While some environmental threats are invisible, or underwater, coal trains and terminals have hard-to-hide footprints. The westbound trains haul over a hundred cars each and reach as long as a mile. And, despite dampening surfactants applied to the exposed coal, up to 500 pounds of coal-dust can be lost from each train-car in a single trip. Some communities could look forward to 18 open-car coal trains a day passing through their backyards if terminal projects were approved.
“A lot of the strongest concern was for public health. People didn't want these trains rolling through their communities,” says Brett. “It brought out doctors, faith leaders, businesses, ranchers, farmers. We set record numbers for public hearings and public testimony.”
In the case of the Longview terminal, which was the first of the six to be proposed and the last to be refused, the Washington Department of Ecology received 257,000 public comments.
Legal challenges and engagement with regulators were the second factor that led to success, says Brett. “We had a strong and aggressive legal component to this campaign, where we challenged permits when necessary, and pushed the state and federal agencies to take a hard look at these projects. We evaluated very closely all of the permits and approvals they would need, and we designed the campaigns around those approvals. That combination of community organizing and strategic legal work was really important.”
Regional tribes and tribal organizations throughout the Northwest were also crucial in holding the line against the trains and terminals. These included the Yakama Nation, the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and the Lummi Nation.
“They all had unique facts and unique regulatory processes,” says Brett. “The tribes played an incredibly important role in standing up for clean water, salmon and treaty rights.”
In Oregon, acknowledgment of a traditional tribal fishery was key in the Department of State Lands' refusal in 2014 to permit a coal terminal at the Port of Morrow on the Columbia River. Similarly, the federal treaty that ensures the fishing rights of the Lummi Nation was the basis for the Army Corps of Engineers' rejection of the $700 million coal terminal at Cherry Point. That decision paved the way for Commissioner Goldmark to return the aquatic acreage to the reserve.
“The Corps may not permit a project that abrogates treaty rights,” the commander of its Seattle District, Colonel John Buck, told a local newspaper as the Lummi celebrated the decision.
Lummi Chairman Tim Ballew added, in a written statement: “Treaty rights shape our region and nation. As tribes across the United States face pressures from development and resource extraction, we'll continue to see tribes lead the fight to defend their treaty rights, and protect and manage their lands and waters for future generations.”
Oil Trains Ahead
Brett VandenHeuvel notes that the oil industry is much stronger than the coal industry, and is “pushing very hard” to move oil trains to West Coast export terminals. “The drilling boom in the West, trying to get that oil to the coast— it's the same situation as coal,” they say.
One of the largest new crude-by-rail terminal proposals is the Tesoro Savage facility in Vancouver, Washington on the Columbia River. The 42-acre site would receive up to 360,000 barrels of oil per day to be loaded onto giant tankers. According to the advocacy group Friends of the Columbia Gorge, the terminal would be the largest in the country and would send four more trains down the Columbia Gorge each day, each carrying “millions of gallons of explosive Bakken crude.” For Brett and others who have spent six years fighting coal trains, it's a case of deja vu.
“The good thing is we've built some pretty big, powerful lists, and local leaders and communities are much more aware of what's going on with their ports,” VandenHeuvel says. There's a lot more scrutiny on some of these decisions, and they're not happening behind closed doors as easily.”
This seems to be the case. In 2016 the State of Washington received over 289,000 comments regarding the proposed crude-by-rail site.
“I think the coal export issue has actually made the oil fights—well, ‘easier' is probably not the right word— but, you know, easier,” Brett concludes. “These kinds of proposals aren't going away. We're definitely still fighting them.” W
Waterkeepers Comment
Bart Mihailovich, former Spokane Riverkeeper, is now Organizer, Eastern U.S. for Waterkeeper Alliance and a veteran of the Northwest coal battle:
I hope at some point Brett and their staff at Columbia Riverkeeper write a book about some of the tactics they used. What they pulled off – and not just them, but a whole lot of people — in terms of effective strategies, with communication and group action—has just been incredible.
In 2010 the coal train issue in Spokane wasn't on anyone's radar. Yet it was very visible, and it affected many places all along the route — cities like Missoula, Sandpoint, Spokane, where train traffic is a fact of life. So it was relatively easy to build up non-conventional allies, like local emergency response people, who were willing to say, “We're simply not ready for this increase in train traffic. It's very dangerous, and lives could be lost if people are stuck behind a track waiting for an emergency response.”
Then there were allies from the passenger-rail companies and from agriculture – grain growers and apple shippers – saying, “We don't want our tracks clogged with coal trains. This is a commodity that's not helping anyone in the U.S.; it's going to be shipped to China and India. We're the local economic drivers, who are putting money and revenue back into this economy.”
So it wasn't just this hippy green thing. It was a lot of people saying, “Let's look at our region in a more realistic way. What kind of community do we want? Do we want train traffic shipping grain or apples or aerospace industry parts, or do we want to put everything behind coal?'”
Puget Soundkeeper Chris Wilke and their organization won a legal battle in 2016 to get coal-by-rail shipper BNSF to pay for clean-up of waterways contaminated by coal, and to study the possibility of covering their train cars. Puget Soundkeeper also achieved tightened restrictions of oil refinery effluent. Here Chris talks about the looming threat of oil trains:
In the coal case with BNSF we were arguing that every car of every train discharged coal into every waterway that it crossed. That doesn't happen with oil trains. What we have with them is high risk and a very high consequence from any disaster. Derailments happen, and oil explodes and flames jump three stories high. It burns for days and spills into waterways, and in some cases people lose their lives.
We participated with Waterkeepers across the country in documenting aging rail infrastructure for Waterkeeper Alliance's 2015 “Deadly Crossing” report. About 40 percent of 250 rail crossings that Waterkeepers examined showed obvious signs of disrepair and possible instability. We saw 25 crossings on Puget Sound where the footings were severely eroded. And the federal government has a limited ability to order repairs on some of these crossings because they are privately owned and railroads are the primary agency in charge of maintaining them.
Last fall the U.S. lifted a 40-year ban on export of crude oil. Right now the market is poor because of the glut of oil, but if gas goes up to $4 or $5 a gallon, you better believe they'll be wanting to export more and more of it, and you'll have more trains, more impact on communities, and higher risks.

By now we've thoroughly defined how historic Bryce Harper's record-breaking 2015 season was. But while expected after becoming one of the most hyped prospects the game has ever seen, Harper's year could also be described as a breakthrough.
After bursting onto the scene with 22 homers in their rookie season, Harper couldn't exceed that total as nagging injuries bothered them the following two years. In 2016, they mashed 42 longballs.
Harper batted .330 in 2015, a whopping 58 points higher than the combined .272 average they posted in their first three seasons. And their 99 RBIs exceeded the best total of their career by 40.
Harper had the majors' best on-base percentage (.460), slugging percentage (.649) and OPS (1.109), and their slash line nearly led the entire National League, if not for their batting average falling three points short of Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon's .333 mark.
The 42 homers mashed by Harper tied Colorado's Nolan Arenado for most in the NL. But Harper's 99 RBIs tied for fifth in the league and well back of Arenado's league-leading 130.
Naturally, one of baseball's top storylines throughout spring training will be whether Harper can duplicate their success from 2015. But why not take it a step further and ask if the 23-year-old can win the NL's first Triple Crown since Joe Medwick accomplished the feat with the Cardinals in 1937? That's a long, long time ago, but remember some of the legends - Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth - that Harper's historic season evoked last year.
Consider that on Sept. 22 of last season, Harper's .342 average and 41 homers led the NL with a just few days remaining, while their RBIs still were well back of Arenado's. But Harper just wasn't getting the run-producing opportunities.
Injuries obliterated the Nationals lineup in 2015, particularly at the top of the order where leadoff man Denard Span was limited to only 61 games, while normal No. 2 hitter Anthony Rendon saw action in just 80 contests. Injury-plagued seasons caused subpar years for veterans Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman, leaving Harper with no protection in the lineup.
If Harper has Span, who tied for the NL lead with 184 hits in 2014, and Rendon, who scored an NL-best 111 runs in 2014, batting in front of them all season, how many more RBIs does the MVP rack up?
So while we know after last year the Nats must stay healthy to contend in 2016, it's also important for Harper to make another run at history. Span is gone, replaced by speedy Ben Revere, who tied the former Nationals center fielder for most hits two seasons ago.
“Of course, he's the MVP,” Revere said of Harper. “I've been watching them for a long time. He's definitely one of the top guys. I know when I get over there I'll be like, ‘I'm just trying to get you a lot of RBIs so you can win back-to-back MVPs.' “
Revere has hit above .300 for three straight seasons. If their hot bat continues in 2016, Harper will get plenty of RBI opportunities. The same goes for a healthy Rendon rebounding this season. Plus, the addition of second baseman Daniel Murphy adds another highly consistent stick with versatility to the Nats lineup.
All of those pieces add up to more damage on pitchers for Harper in 2016 and possibly a run at the first NL Triple Crown in 79 years.
Not all game designers are into poetry. Not all poets are into videogames. But the overlap is probably more present than you might think: after all, both occupations generally seem to attract different variations of the same basic type of person, someone heavily involved in their own work with a very particular taste for things most people may find obscure and uninteresting. It's little wonder that we see so many instances of famous poems being specifically mentioned in games, from Ashley Williams' love of Tennyson in Mass Effect to the use of an Alan Seeger poem in the trailer for Gears of War 2.
When a game creates its own poetry, however, it's another matter entirely. Sometimes it's a simple attempt to convey a clue or plot point to the player, but in many cases it exists solely to flesh out the game's universe (or maybe give us a cheap laugh). Now, being a self-proclaimed frustrated former English major, I know some of you may not find this as interesting as I do, but I feel it's worth it to take a look at those moments when videogames try to take part in one of humanity's oldest artistic traditions. Yes, verily, it's an easily traced line that runs from Virgil to Keats to Mass Effect 2. Don't believe me? You shouldn't. But read on anyway!
9) “Bowser's Haiku”, Super Mario RPG
You're quite forgiven for not remembering this little moment from the treasured SNES classic. It's a quick, simple joke but a funny one all the same, and it occurs as Mario and their squad finally breach the factory of the evil Smithy, who has been manufacturing monsters in an attempt to take over “Mario's World” (8:55 in the above video). Frustrated that Smithy's minions don't take them seriously, Bowser (who has joined Mario as a party member) ventures outside the text box to express their inner turmoil in haiku form and it's a sensitivity we rarely see in him. As a side note, I always thought this game's calypso battle music was hilariously inappropriate, especially in the dark and gloomy final levels. Hey gang, we've just fought a giant creepy-ass sword with a face and are now fending off angry sentient hammers in an attempt to stop a tyrannical machinist with a shape-shifting head from using living weapons to destroy the world! Dance party!
8) Royal Elegy, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
The Composer Brothers of Hyrule, Sharp and Flat (womp womp), are known primarily for their graves, their ridiculous mustaches, and the secret melody they left behind that can change night into day. You may have forgotten, though, that an unnamed memorial poem (not called an elegy in-game) precedes the discovery of those notes. This short piece of non-rhyming verse is said to honor the royal family, but it makes a lot more sense as an advertisement for the powers of the Sun Song. And it's not exactly a whole wall's worth of material, is it. Seriously, there's no way a poem that short requires that much carving space no matter what language it's in, but whatevers. It is of course revealed later in Majora's Mask that the brothers may also be responsible for the Song of Storms or are at least aware of it; that has nothing to do with this poem, but it's a little tidbit you can use to impress any friends you may still have.
7) “The Book of the Blind”, Diablo
We only get to read two verses from “The Book of the Blind”, though village elder and Zardoz fan Deckard Cain knows some related passages, but it is apparently an ancient and heavy tome of some repute, found in the appropriately named Halls of the Blind on level 7 of the catacombs. Aside from some metrical stumbling in the last line, this poem presents us with some of the most abominable trochees since Longfellow (poetry tip: The Song of Hiawatha is a lot easier to read once you realize it has the same rhythm as Cream's “Tales of Great Ulysses”). However, unlike Longfellow, this poem actually proves useful in that it provides us with a hint on how to deal with the invisible enemies in the Halls of the Blind, the dungeon in which the book is found. Ok, I guess it's not really a hint so much as a general and vague description, but if you wanted concrete answers you'd be asking Bradygames, wouldn't you?
6) “Hovering Contemplatively”, Fallout 3
As I pointed out in a previous Daily List, Fallout 3 already has a pretty well-known poem read by a robot, which functions as a killer in-joke for Bradbury fans. But there's another poem, this one written by a robot, to be found in the Citadel. Yes, the charming Mr. Handy unit known as “Sawbones” apparently has something of a creative streak and has tried one of their many prehensile appendages at a bit of verse. The results fall somewhat short of “There Will Come Soft Rains”. Quite a bit short, in fact, although I suppose the floating metal octopus should get points for a consistent rhyme scheme. The fact that this poem is tucked away on a terminal suggests it may not be something Sawbones was willing to share, as deathly shy as they are. Perhaps this medibot, like Doctor Zhivago, is a strong, tough-looking soul with a secret poetic side (note: as of this writing I have not actually seen Doctor Zhivago).
5) “The Gate Riddle,” King's Quest VI
There's a good deal of poetry in the fairy-tale inspired King's Quest universe, particularly if you count the rhyming incantations used to cast spells (King's Quest III annoyingly made you type out each line in its entirety, which reduces the charm somewhat). The much-praised sixth installment features an optional sidequest where Prince Alexander must journey through the land of the dead to bring their beloved's parents back to life. He's confronted by all manner of horrors and obstacles, including handsy zombies, dancing skeletons, and the World's Slipperiest Death Bridge before reaching the gate to the Lord of the Dead's chambers. “Gate” is also kind of its name, I guess, because the thing is not only alive but conversational and very creepy, with an appetite for humans which raises all sorts of unproductive biological questions. Anyway, if you're not stupid enough to actually try to touch it, Gate offers you a chance to prove yourself and earn passage by solving an A-A-A-A rhyming verse riddle. The answer will surprise no one who remembers the ending of The Fifth Element, and while it's not too difficult to figure out on your own, there's a torn riddle book earlier in the game to give you a big clue. The correct response pisses Gate off, prompting them to bellow “Burden me not with thy poetry!” (having been through several creative writing workshops in my time, I sympathize). An incorrect response is almost worth it just to see the amusing animation of Alex getting eaten by a giant face. Dying anywhere in King's Quest VI sends you into the Land of the Dead; dying three screens after passing into it alive is especially shameful.
4) “King Olaf's Verse,” The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim
It's a pity that with all its customization and emphasis on exploring, Skyrim doesn't actually let you become a bard, not even after completing the quests for the Bard's College in Windhelm. I know it's not up on the list of fan requests but I'd love it if there could be a DLC that allowed you to write and perform songs in taverns for money, thereby making virtual barding as desperate and demanding as it is in real life. As it stands, you only really get one chance to exercise your poemcrafting skills towards the end of those College quests, after you recover the fragments of an ancient ballad and must fill in the blanks. Your job is to portray the king as an evil nutcase but you can do one further if you have a high enough persuasion skill and leave some lines in there about Olaf actually being a dragon. I wish there had been an extra option to write some lines about them becoming a mammoth, but you can't have everything.
3) “Blue Rose of Illium”, Mass Effect 2
There are examples/implications that all sorts of alien races in the Mass Effect universe have produced poetry, even the Elcor, but this particular piece is the most notable instance. The subject of both an amusing sidequest in Mass Effect 2 and a comic featured on the Escapist, this ode is penned by lovesick Krogan Charr for their Asari beau Ereba. Depending on your actions, they can eventually be won back over, only on the condition that they stop lyricizing. While it's certainly no “Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning”, Krogan poetry doesn't seem to show much more promise than its Vogon counterpart (hmm…those names are starting to sound a little similar). The knowledge that the stubborn lizardpeople have a tender side does lend some much-needed color to the warlike Krogan culture, though. Actually, this subplot gets rather poignant in the third game, where you can find the dying Charr and deliver their last message back to their love on the Citadel.
2) “Loveless,” Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII
“Loveless” is actually one of the more complex works on this list: it was first an epic poem, then a critically acclaimed stage play so popular that posters of it can be seen all over Midgar. We find out the most about it through the characters of Crisis Core, specifically the tormented Gackt look-alike Genesis Rhapsodos. As you might gather from their surname, Genesis is of a literary bent, at least when it comes to this one poem, and they quote it extensively. In real life this would make them an insufferable douchebag, but in the game…well, he's kind of an insufferable douchebag, but you pity them all the same. From what we hear of “Loveless”, it seems to be a little like the Final Fantasy version of the Bhagavad Gita, crossed with the sellsword riddle from Game of Thrones, involving a Hero, Wanderer and Prisoner looking for “the Gift of the Goddess” (spoiler: at least one person ends up without love). The poem holds great meaning for Genesis, who spends most of the game slowly dying and seeking to achieve the Gift to possibly heal himself. The most you can say about the poem “Loveless”, which may or may not also be the name of the larger collection it is contained in, is that it's just about as impenetrable as most real-life metaphysical poems, and it is definitely the only entry on this list to (indirectly) inspire its own tote bag.
1) “Grim Fandango”, Grim Fandango
It's actually possible to play through the entirety of Tim Schafer's legendary Aztec/noir adventure game without running into the moment that give it its name, but you'd be a fool to miss it. The game's story is a bizarrely agreeable crime drama set in the Mexican Land of the Dead, in which you are a low-level reaper who leaves the fold upon discovering a tangled web of corruption. In the Blue Casket, a jazz club in the seedy seaside town of Rubacava frequented by a host of finger-snapping, beret-wearing skeletons (or “dead Beats”, as Manny quips), hepcat Olivia Ofrenda holds court as the poet-in-residence, complete with a trenchcoat and a long cigarette holder. If spoken to, they can be persuaded to perform a few of their chestnuts (if Manny performs an impromptu poem and then asks her, they will shamelessly steal from him). Them best work is undoubtedly the titular macabre rumination on death and the afterlife. Actually, this and other poems in the game are pretty good: elsewhere, Manny can be made to recite a seeming impromptu verse about the moon that's quite haunting. I'm hoping Ginsberg would have at least seen the humor in all this, especially since becoming something of a dead Beat himself.
Mesut Ozil Donates World Cup Bonus to Sick Brazilian Children
Germany's Mesut Ozil has donated their World Cup 2014 bonus to funding the surgeries for sick children in Brazil.
In a statement released on the midfielder's official Facebook page, they wrote:
“Dear fans,
Prior to the ‪#‎WorldCup I supported the surgery of eleven sick children. Since the victory of the #WorldCup is not only due to eleven players but to our whole team, I will now raise the number to 23. This is my personal thank-you for the hospitality of the people of Brazil. ‪#‎Bigshoe ‪#‎Brasil2014”
The Germany and Arsenal midfielder is believed to have contributed roughly £240,000, the amount of money they received for helping Germany defeat Argentina in the World Cup final. It had previously been reported that the 25-year-old had donated money to children in Gaza effected by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, but their representative Roland Eitel informed The Independent that this was not the case, saying: “The claim that Mesut donated money to Gaza is not true.
“Maybe in the future, who knows? They donated money to causes in Brazil and they are now on holiday.”

Doughnuts, also known as donuts, were circular cakes with a hole in the middle. They were often covered in different types of icing. They were a favorite food of Zeltrons. They were also enjoyed by Hiromi, who discovered them in the royal kitchens when they invaded Zeltros.[1]
Porcellus, Jabba's chef, brought vine-coffee and a doughnut to Princess Leia while they were enslaved by the Hutt, but the coffee and doughnut were appropriated by Lando Calrissian.[2]
When Kyle Katarn infiltrated the Imperial facility on Danuta to steal the plans to the Death Star, they shot an Imperial commando who was eating a doughnut.[3]
Dexter Jettster owned a doughnut shop called Dex's Donuts where they served such varieties as iced donuts with shredded Ishi Tib-cracked coconut or dark matter sprinkles, Dianoga cream-filled donuts, Yowvetch custard-filled donuts, Muja fruit-filled donuts, and powdered Christophsian sugar donuts.[4]

Australia looks set to launch a 200MW large-scale solar auction after the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) revealed its new funding plan.
ARENA, which the government had threatened to disband, will focus on just two funding programmes. The existing R&D stream will continue with the second stream called 'Advancing Renewables'. The new funding strategy has been approved by minister for industry and science, Ian Macfarlane.
The organisation also list its five priorities: integrating renewables and grids, renewables for use in industrial processes, off grid areas, fringe of grid and constrained sections of the grid and large-scale PV.
“The five priorities represent current market imperatives or opportunities and are the main areas where ARENA investment can have the greatest impact at this point in time,” said Ivor Frischknecht, chief executive of ARENA.
“To date, ARENA has invested AU$1.1 billion in 230 renewable energy projects across the innovation chain, with each funding dollar leveraging close to two dollars of funding from other sources – these targeted priorities will allow us to build on our existing portfolio, creating the conditions that will accelerate change.
The proposed competitive solar auction would be open to grid-connected projects between 10-50MW. A consultation process is underway.
“We are proposing a new large-scale solar auction for approximately 200MW worth of projects, with AU$80-100 million (US$59-74 million) support from ARENA, and will be seeking feedback shortly with the intention to open the round in September 2015,” added Frischknecht.
The Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) welcomed the announcement and highlighted the potential of large-scale solar in the country.
“The solar potential of Australia is obvious but financing for large-scale solar has been difficult due to market and policy uncertainty,” said Oliver Yates, CEO, CEFC. “The CEFC stands ready to invest and help catalyse the additional funding required for the growth of large-scale solar in Australia.
“The CEFC will continue to work closely with ARENA to identify opportunities for debt financing that can help maximise the potential of the projects ARENA supports, including projects that are part of the announced large-scale solar auction. We will continue to apply our commercial approach to investment in renewable, low emissions and energy efficient technologies,” added Yates.
The auction represents a small step forward for large-scale solar in Australia, which had virtually ground to a halt during the prolonged period of political horse-trading over the future of the country's Renewable Energy Target. This was eventually resolved last month in a deal that saw the RET retained but scaled back.
But in what will be seen as a fresh attack by the Abbott government on Australia's shift to low-carbon energy sources, earlier this week the CEFC was served with a mandate aimed at blocking it from supporting schemes designed to support small-scale rooftop solar.
In response, John Grimes, CEO of the Australian Solar Council told the Guardian newspaper that the Australian solar industry was set to expand its campaign to target marginal Coalition seats to force the government either to change its stance on renewables or “pay the political price”.
Curioser and curioser, as Alice said in their adventures in Wonderland. The longer the crisis in the eurozone has gone on, the more it has come to resemble something penned by Lewis Carroll.
Here are just a few of the surreal aspects of the current state of affairs. The answer to a lack of growth in struggling countries such as Greece is austerity of such ferocity that recessions deepen. The solution to a financial crisis caused originally by the over-leveraging of banks and individuals is to turn Europe's bailout fund into a leveraged €2tn hedge fund. Meanwhile, many of the politicians in Britain who battled long and hard to keep the pound – George Osborne and Ed Balls to name but two – are now born-again evangelists for full fiscal union.
How to make sense of all this? It's hard, but as the king says as they preside over the court in Alice in Wonderland: "Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop."
Monetary union was born out of two developments: the idea that there should be ever closer union in Europe and the breakup of the postwar fixed exchange rate system in the early 1970s.
The idea was that member states would pool their monetary sovereignty to form one currency that would have one interest rate set by one central bank. Architects of the grand design argued there would be multiple benefits from the new arrangements: Europe would grow closer together, it would become more stable and it would grow faster. To those who insisted that a one-size-fits-all monetary policy would never work, and that slower, asymmetric growth would lead to the build-up of economic and financial pressures, the response from those banging the drum for the single currency was classic Carroll: "No, no! Sentence first – verdict afterwards."
Predictably, the stresses and strains inherent in a monetary arrangement that involved yoking together countries as diverse (not just economically but culturally) as Germany and Greece, Portugal and Finland, Austria and Spain quickly manifested themselves. The weaker countries on the periphery saw their costs of production rise more rapidly than those at the core, and gradually became less competitive as a result. Although Europe as a whole saw its trade balance remain close to zero, Germany ran a hefty trade surplus at the expense of Italy, Spain and Greece.
Speculative orgy
Just as China recycled its trade surplus into the global economy through the purchase of US treasury bonds, so Germany's surplus headed south to fuel property bubbles in Spain and to finance excessive borrowing by Greece. The actions of China and Germany kept the speculative orgy going for a while, but only by making the eventual hangover worse.
In the days before monetary union, a country that had seen its competitiveness eroded had an easy, if not painless, remedy. It would devalue its currency, making its exports cheaper and its imports dearer. Inflation would go up and structural weaknesses would be ignored, but it was a way of rubbing along. Inside the single currency, there is only one way a country such as Greece can compete with Germany and that is to lower the cost of the goods and services it produces. That means lower wages, smaller pensions and deep cuts in public spending. And not just for one or two years: the adjustment process within monetary union involves decades of austerity. For the Greeks and the Italians, the message is jam tomorrow and jam yesterday but never jam today.
The climax of Alice in Wonderland is the courtroom scene in which the issue is "Who stole the tarts?" In the case of the eurozone, the easy answer is that it is Greece, which failed to play by the rules, borrowing too much and cooking the books so that the rest of the members of the single currency club were ignorant of the dire state of the Hellenic public finances. In fact, the real culprit is Germany, which has failed to appreciate that for monetary union to work, the big creditor nations have a responsibility to help the debtor nations by expanding domestic demand. The German political class appears to believe both that every country in the euro area can be as competitive as Germany and that Germany, in those circumstances, will continue to run a massive trade surplus. That's a logical absurdity the Reverend Dodgson would certainly have appreciated.
To make matters even more deliciously weird, Berlin now faces a dilemma. The crisis in the euro area has been allowed to fester for the best part of two years, allowing the contagion to spread from Greece to other peripheral countries. As a result, the cost of cleaning up the mess has grown enormously. The first bailout for Greece in May 2010 was just over €100bn. By the time of the emergency eurozone summit in July 2011, it was deemed necessary to expand the European financial stability facility to create a €440bn fighting fund. Two months or so later, the perception is that Europe will need to have €2tn, perhaps even €3tn, to face down the financial markets.
It is unclear, as yet, how European policymakers intend to turn one euro into five, but it seems to involve setting up a special purpose vehicle backed by Germany and France. At its core will be the EFSF, which will be underpinned by financial guarantees from Berlin and Paris. The EFSF will not be increased from €440bn, but will be used as collateral to expand the scale of bond purchases to support the weaker states. Even assuming the rating agencies are happy with this (and they may not be), Germany and France would be putting their creditworthiness at risk. Put simply, they would be betting the farm on a highly leveraged special purpose vehicle. Deja vu, anyone?
Yet the alternative does not look all that attractive either. Germany could, in theory, declare that it was no longer prepared to write the bailout cheques for the rest of Europe. It could start printing some lovely new deutschmarks or perhaps start exploratory talks with the Austrians, Finns and Dutch about a hardcore euro made up of half a dozen broadly convergent economies. But even assuming this could be achieved without plunging not just Europe but the rest of the global economy into a second Great Depression (and it probably could not), the upshot would be that German banks would face potentially ruinous losses on a wave of sovereign debt defaults, while German exporters would be priced out of overseas markets because the new DM would appreciate sharply on the foreign exchanges.
Up until now, policymakers have solved this dilemma by refusing to admit that it exists. The assumption has been that the events of the recent past have all been a bad dream from which Europe will wake up. Only recently has it been recognised that the single currency really is plunging down a rabbit hole and is going to hit the ground with an almighty bump.
And to those who say that out of the wreckage will emerge a full-blown fiscal union that Britain stands apart from at its peril, the adventures of Alice provide the perfect riposte. "If everybody minded their own business," said the Duchess, "the world would go round a good deal faster than it does."

The Fremennik are a hardy bunch, but they're still vulnerable to frostbite. Wrapping up warm won't help them, however: this frostbite belongs to the giant wolf, Hati! As many Fremennik are abroad at Daemonheim, this winter, they have swallowed their pride and asked the adventurers of RuneScape to band together and rid them of this legendary lupine.
The invite is open to all RuneScape members, and can be started by talking to the Fremennik citizen who stands inside the gates of Rellekka. Even those who are yet to brave White Wolf Mountain can participate: simply talk to the wolf hunter in Barbarian Village (Gunnarsgrunn) and they will lead you to Rellekka. While you're out searching for Hati, you might even stumble across defenders of the realm (aka Jagex moderators) who will pitch into the fight where they can.
Hati feeds for four weeks of the year, which only gives a small window of opportunity to gear up, gather like-minded adventurers and rid RuneScape of the beast. Wolf-killers should keep in mind that Hati leaves the game on Monday 14th February, taking any potential rewards with it, so now's your only chance to send them howling to their doom!
Speaking of rewards... The Hati head is a cosmetic hat that shows off your achievement, while the Hati paws are the highlight: these gloves reward you with double the XP you gain from skills (Attack, Constitution, Defence, Magic, Ranged, Strength) while in combat. There is a limit to the additional XP you can gain from these gloves, but that limit is determined by your levels in those combat skills. On Tuesday 10th May, these gloves will lose any remaining charge, so make sure to use them while you can. Once their charge has run out, you can still keep hold of them as a second cosmetic item to match your hat.
“I come at coldest winter to bite and gnash and gnaw. People of the Fremennik, fear me. I am Hati, and I will devour the moon, and my brother, Sköll, the sun, and thus will begin the End of Things.” – Fremennik folk tale

Now that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have officially been named as the presidential nominees for their respective parties, both campaigns will shift their focus toward capturing the White House in November—and destroying one another in the process.
Most political experts believe the rest of the 2016 election will end up being the most divisive, angry, mudslinging affair in modern political history. And while the current election cycle has been nothing short of depressing for many Americans, one person has found for themselves a potential opportunity in the midst of political chaos: Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson.
So far, Johnson has received more media attention in this election than any Libertarian Party presidential candidate in history. The former two-term Republican governor of New Mexico, Johnson couldn't be more different than their two traditional-party competitors. He's mild-mannered, and their seemingly odd, nontraditional combination of policy ideas leave many voters from all over the political spectrum agreeing with every other thing they say.
Like many libertarians, Johnson can generally be described as very fiscally conservative, a defender of individual and states' rights, and socially liberal, including on issues such as abortion.
Johnson's foreign policy views have been termed by many to be “isolationist” and “dovish,” even compared to most Democrats. For instance, unlike Clinton, Johnson did not support the Iraq War, and they also opposed bombing Libya.
Johnson has called Trump's plan to build a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border “crazy,” saying the government should make it “as easy as possible to come into this country to work.”
Johnson's rare blend of conservative and liberal policies would normally make them rather unattractive to many voters—especially older, entrenched voters who are more comfortable with the traditional Democrat-Republican divide. But this election is unlike any other in modern American history. Clinton and Trump are wildly unpopular. One recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows a majority of U.S. voters have a negative view of both Clinton and Trump, and 21 percent of the likely voters polled said they won't vote for either candidate.
Just because voters are less than pleased with the Clinton-Trump choice doesn't mean any candidate other than those two can attain the 270 electoral votes needed to be named president, and virtually all political analysts and historians—in line with conventional political wisdom—agree Johnson has no hope of victory.
But rather than admit defeat, the unconventional Johnson is employing a fittingly unconventional political strategy, which could, as unlikely as it might sound, end with a Libertarian in the White House.
Ron Meyer—editor of Red Alert Politics, a right-of-center political website—reported on July 8 Johnson's strategy of capturing the presidency is fixated on stopping both Clinton and Trump from earning 270 electoral votes by focusing on winning a very small number of states. Depending on which states Clinton and Trump win, it's possible for Johnson to deny both candidates the electoral votes they need by winning as few as one state.
Should Johnson be successful at denying everyone the White House on Election Day, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution states the president would be decided by the House of Representatives, currently controlled by a significant majority of Republicans. Each state delegation in the House would have one vote, and voters would only be allowed to choose from the top three candidates.
While some might think Republicans in the House would by default choose Trump, but Johnson believes it would be possible—and maybe even likely—anti-Trump constitutional Republicans and Democrats fearful of a Trump presidency might come together to form an otherwise unthinkable coalition that would make Johnson the president.
This wild scenario may not be as absurd as it sounds. Johnson only needs to win one strategically chosen state, and as Meyer points out, “He is already polling at 10 percent overall and around 20 percent among millennials—all while they only has less than 50 percent name recognition.”
Johnson's off-the-wall plan is a bit crazy, but in an election such as this, crazy might actually work.
A few years ago I enthusiastically embraced the feminist label. Its ideals felt realistic and egalitarian and I hadn't yet encountered any of the radicals that receive so much attention now. Enrollment in a gender studies course familiarized me with the vocabulary and recent postulates. Now, the outspoken members representing the movement have betrayed the basic principles of the earlier feminist movements and created a toxic environment to make social progress.
Modern feminism and its millennial spin-off were ostensibly about challenging oppressive narratives, yet now the presiding narrative is decidedly feminist and decidedly oppressive (for issues like free speech, equal protection, due process, scapegoat culture, etc.). It is the dominant culture: gender studies degrees are available at every university. Television and other media have learned to pander and cater to feminist ideals for viewership and left wing brownie points. Feminists, in debates, have searched for things to find sexist or oppressive that only ten years ago were not and still much credibility has been given to their furthest reaches by mainstream journalism, legislation and dictionaries, which are the ultimate democratic platforms. Given this, it must be concluded that feminism is the establishment, and, as with any establishment, those who would oppose get their voices silenced or skewered.
So, it can no longer be pretended that feminism is an underdog idea. And as usual, the status quo comes with its share of censorship. When someone is critical of feminism I have often seen their views get conflated with some form of bigotry à la fallacious generalizations and stereotypes. Judging Zoe Quinn, videogame developer, for allegedly cheating on their boyfriend with five men can get the speaker accused of slut-shaming, which just isn't the same thing at all as the original judgment. Pointing out that obesity is unhealthy can get someone grouped as a body-shamer. The other day, a Facebook friend of mine posted “…do not tell people they lost weight. do not tell people they gained weight. please. it is not your place” [sic]. The discussion on weight, apparently, belongs only to an individual with themselves.
Of course, movements never refer to their policing as “censorship” when it can be avoided, epitomized by this euphemization on a popular feminist website: “Since we are not the government, this isn't censorship — this is how we institute anti-oppression.”
This is the same movement that, in the last few years, has extended no-platforming from the exclusion of burgeoning fascists to the exclusion of intellectuals who lack zeal for mainstream feminism. The same movement that pushes safe spaces and harasses faculty for not using trigger warnings. The same movement that leads to the defunding of schools when their programs don't align properly with the agenda. The same movement that, should its vocalists be taken literally, would have the next generation coddled in ignorance and isolation.
If you haven't been following Gamergate and anti-GG, it's unclear what the battle is anymore — if creative expression needs to be strangled anywhere it runs free, if select feminists are trying to force women into activities they statistically don't enjoy, or if anything perceived as a “men's playground” needs to be dissolved. In the debate, opponents would just as soon swear to Gamergates' collective misogyny as to the conclusion that women supporting Gamergate are out for male attention. Another paradoxical incantation is that women game as much as men yet more women need to be invited into the gaming world. The contradictions are seemingly intrinsic to young feminists. The jeer of “masculinity so fragile” is near ubiquitous on websites for edgy young adults, by the same visionaries who affirm an oppressive patriarchy. Feminists on social media claim to deplore racism but are socially protected in general vilification of what they perceive to be dominant. The movement is supposed to fight for trans rights but instead millennials consistently humiliate the authenticity of the experience by convoluting the gender identity field with absurdities. The mental gymnastics required to quasi-validate certain feminist ideological commitments are too demanding even for the most trained in manipulative rhetoric.
Segregation is unity. Advantages are equality. The same radicals that are, or are masquerading as, modern feminists would ace interviews for the Ministry of Truth.
Some of the accepted ideas of the main movement are questionable, regardless of the extremists. One of feminism's fundamental staples that I'm reluctant to believe concerns sexual objectification in advertisements, mainly that it disproportionately happens to women. I'm in further disbelief that sexual objectification is inherently a bad thing and not just a signature of a sexually-liberated society. Also, the idea that Barbie dolls teach men that women are objects is as ridiculous as the argument that videogames cause violent behavior. Human beings distinguish between plastic and flesh. And human beings, including men, are not inherently evil or misogynistic.
Alongside that, it doesn't take more than attending one social gathering to understand we do not live in a rape culture. Yet writers for popular magazines, under the guise of feminism, claim that men believe they have a right to rape, rape is as American as apple pie, rape is the norm, and rape jokes create a rape culture. The White House even stated America has a “tolerance” for rape. You do not have to do research to understand how despised rape is in North America, yet people masquerading as feminists have already convinced the major sources of information that our culture is immersed in it. It is unapologetic bullshit.
Now, modern feminism does cover important points. Intersectional feminism (the fact that this branch exists alone should raise some questions about the inclusiveness of its root movement) has attempted to carry the weight of racial disparities, such as in the criminal justice system. To blindly carry on writing about feminism without addressing its faults is naïve, as foolish as criticizing its entire movement without addressing its modern accomplishments. It would be ignorant to say it's a wholly progressive movement for tolerance and it would be dishonest to say it's inherently anti-male. In the post-information age there is no sure fire way to decipher true from false news aside from the utilization of personal experience; a federally-backed statistic can come out and another that completely contradicts it, equally credible. All information is politicized before presentation. Cyphering through the truth of the matter takes critical thinking and experience to form educated conclusions.
A number of people have had the experience with feminism such that it would be unethical to not describe themselves as feminists. Conversely, a number of people have had the experience with feminism such that aligning with it would be unethical and morally reprehensible. This movement boils down to your personal encounters with it – such is the consequence of a peoples' ideology that is progressing heavily online without positively identifiable leaders. Your core values aren't adequate for identification because there are numerous other, similar movements for the millennial progressive and feminism in different situations isn't any particular way. To each individual feminism means something different and these different perspectives are all valid so long as the experience they're built upon actually transpired.
So, what does feminism really stand for? At its best: socio-economic equality of the sexes; the canonization of new ideas, particularly about gender and intersectional marginalization; implantation of merit-based diversity in the workplace and political sphere; and liberty for women across the globe. At its worse: censorship, most efficaciously of opposing viewpoints and politically incorrect comedy; racial hatred manifest as appropriate political opinion; reactionary rhetoric; first-world problems; and victim manufacturing.
I support sex workers. I support LGBTQ+. I'm pro-choice. I'm pro-diversity. I think MRAs are ridiculous. I've been all these things ever since I could form an opinion. You can want liberties and social equality without being a feminist, and in fact, more people want equality than identify themselves as feminists. This consideration alone should demonstrate the lack of need for the label. But only one thing is certain: if you support the restriction of free speech outside of genuinely dangerous scenarios, you are sympathetic to fascism. Modern feminists would do well to distinguish themselves from neofascists.
0 Former police officer diagnosed with cancer sues agency after termination
ORANGE CITY, Fla. - A former officer is suing the Orange City Police Department because they said they were fired while undergoing treatment for cancer.
Nick Giampietro was a police officer in Orange City for years until their life was turned upside down.
"Out of the blue I was diagnosed with cancer," Giampietro said.
The former SWAT team member thought their potentially deadly cancer was the worst of their problems until they got a termination letter from Orange City leaders.
Giampietro used up their sick leave time and was fired while using sick leave that was donated by co-workers. The news came just six weeks before they were scheduled to return to duty.
"Of course I'm angry because you know, like I said, I considered them like a family," Giampietro said.
The former officer is now suing in federal court to get their job back.
"After battling for my life, I'm battling for my career," Giampietro said.
The lawsuit claims the city violated the Family Medical Leave Act by firing Giampietro while they underwent surgery and chemotherapy.
"I would endure eight hours of chemo therapy, five days a week," Giampietro said.
They said the termination left them in debt and struggling to pay for health insurance when they needed it the most.
"It just feels like every door is closed because of this," Giampietro said.
Orange City leaders would not comment on the lawsuit because it's pending litigation.

U.S. gross domestic product fell 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, according to the third revised estimate from the U.S. Commerce Department. Earlier preliminary estimates had reported a smaller decline in GDP.
Contributing to this higher figure for GDP decline were downward revisions to health-care spending following the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act. Government economists initially predicted that newly-insured Americans (and those on new plans) would spend more on healthcare than they did in the first quarter.
Most of the contraction in the first quarter is still attributed to severe winter weather across the country in early 2014 -- including the so-called Polar Vortex that spread across many northern states. It led consumers to go out, and spend, less. Businesses cut back on hiring, production, and investment. Other factors slowing the economy down included elimination of federal long-term unemployment benefits, and cuts to the federal food stamp program.
“This is a terrible number,” said economist John Canally at brokerage company LPL Financial in Boston. Yet, they said the stock and bond markets mostly ignored the statistic, looking forward instead to economic performance in the second quarter, as well as anticipated growth for the rest of the year and into 2015.
“The second quarter looks pretty strong,” said Canally, “with GDP tracking (positive) to between 4 percent and 5 percent. It would be the best run rate on the economy since well before the Great Recession.”
Canally pointed out that consumer confidence is up and so is hiring by businesses. Unemployment claims are down, while the manufacturing sector has strengthened.
There are also worrisome economic indicators on the horizon: rising consumer prices, especially for food and gasoline; stagnant wages for most workers; historically high levels of long-term unemployment; and international tensions in the Middle East, East Asia and Eastern Europe.
Most economists don't think there's much danger of the U.S. slipping back into recession -- at least, not without a significant shock, such as a further spike in oil prices.
MIT economist Jim Poterba is president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, which determines when the U.S. is officially in recession. They said the GDP reversal this past winter does teach us something about economic prediction.
“What I think we learned from the Polar Vortex, and we could learn from a protected heat wave, is that there are closer links between extreme weather fluctuations and economic activity than we may recognize,” said Poterba. “Potentially, extreme heat can have similar kinds of effects -- extreme demands on the electricity grid, for example.”
The National Weather Service predicts higher-than-normal temperatures in many regions of the U.S. this summer, including the West Coast, the Southern Great Plains, the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic States.

Nine months after announcing that China would help build a high-speed rail line from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, the private U.S. company behind the plan says the deal is off and that it will seek a partner elsewhere.
Las Vegas-based XpressWest said in a statement that the decision to terminate the relationship with China Railway International was based "primarily upon difficulties associated with timely performance and CRI's challenges in obtaining required authority to proceed with required development activities.”
The company indicated its "biggest challenge” was a federal government requirement that high-speed trains must be manufactured in the United States to secure regulatory approvals.
"As everyone knows, there are no high-speed trains manufactured in the United States,” the statement said. "This inflexible requirement has been a
fundamental barrier to financing high-speed rail in our country. For the past
10 years, we have patiently waited for policymakers to recognize high-speed
rail in the United States is a new enterprise and that allowing trains from
countries with decades of safe high-speed rail experience is needed to connect
the Southwest region and start this new industry."
XpressWest said it is optimistic that CRI and its affiliates will one-day succeed in establishing a viable presence in the United States rail market but that, in the meantime, it is undeterred by the obstacles "and remains dedicated to completing its high-speed passenger rail project.''
"XpressWest will now aggressively pursue other available development partnerships and options expected to result in a more efficient and cost-
effective project implementation experience,” said XpressWest CEO Tony Marnell.
The deal with the Chinese provided for CRI to assist develop, finance, build and potentially operate the XpressWest rail project connecting Las Vegas to Los Angeles, with stations in Las Vegas, Victorville and Palmdale, and service throughout Los Angeles.
China launched its own domestic high-speed rail service in 2007 and has the world's most extensive network of such trains, covering more than 12,000
miles, according to the Los Angeles Times. It is now trying to export its rail
technology, vying for contracts in Mexico, Southeast Asia and elsewhere, according to the newspaper. The L.A.-Vegas route would have been China's first such contract in the United States.
Safety-related recalls are certainly the red-hot-button issue in the auto business these days, particularly with General Motors facing possible legal problems regarding 1.62 million models from 2005-2007 with faulty ignition switches and Toyota agreeing to a $1.2 billion penalty to settle a criminal probe over claims of unintended acceleration that led to a recall of over 10 million vehicles.
Raging headlines over duplicitous mismanagement at the root of worst-scenario cases like these not withstanding, recalls have become common to the point where most are rendered virtually meaningless to an automaker's image. How common? According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, last year the auto industry recalled close to a third more vehicles in the U.S. (22 million) than it sold (just over 15 million). Recalls were up by a whopping 25 percent during 2013, which is industry's highest rate since 2004 when 30.8 million vehicles were involved in such campaigns. Even exotic makes like Lamborghini and Lotus aren't immune to the occasional recall.
Toyota/Lexus/Scion led the pack for the second year in a row with nearly 5.3 million cars and trucks recalled, followed by the Chrysler Group at around 4.7 million and Honda/Acura with nearly 2.8 million models recalled. While these would seem to be staggering numbers, as NHTSA points out they're not weighed against sales, and as such aren't necessarily a predictor of a given model line's inherent safety or its long-term reliability.
To that end, the statisticians at the car-search website iSeeCars.com dug deep into both recall histories and sales records from the last three decades to determine which automakers have the best – and worst – track records for recalls relative to their volume. Specifically, they looked at sales records dating back to 1980, and recalls registered since 1985, based on the assumption that most such actions occur after a given model has spent some time out on the road.
While it may come as no shock that luxury-car maker Mercedes-Benz came out atop the list of least-recalled brands, with an average 0.41 units recalled per vehicle sold, General Motors, with nearly 100 million vehicles recalled since 1985, actually placed third-best, with 0.65 cars and trucks recalled per unit sold.
Of the 15 major automakers surveyed, Hyundai Motor Company can lay claim to having the worst ratio, with 1.15 vehicles recalled for every model sold since it introduced the Excel to U.S. buyers in 1986. Other brands found to have recalled more cars than they sold in the U.S. over the last 30 years (needless to say this represents a number of cars for which multiple campaigns were initiated) include Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and Volvo; Chrysler broke even, so to speak, with a one-to-one sales-to-recall ratio. (Scroll down for the full results.)
What can car shoppers headed to dealers' showrooms in 2014 glean from these findings? Not much, we're afraid. As is the case with stocks and bonds, past performance is not necessarily an indication of how well or poorly a given model will fare in the future. The Ghost of General Motors Past has certainly come back to haunt the “New GM” in a truly frightening manner, but by all accounts the cars the company builds today are inherently far better than the lackluster models from nearly a decade ago (Chevy Cobalt, Saturn Ion, et, al.) that are at the epicenter of its present predicament.
While a lower recall rate could indeed imply that a given automaker does a better job of manufacturing and/or quality control, it may also come down to which brands are managed better than others. “The recall rate could be an indication of a manufacturer's risk tolerance or strategy,” explains iSeeCars,com CEO Phong Ly. “Some automakers may issue recalls at a higher frequency because they may be more cautious and proactive.”
Following that line of reasoning, some recalls might even be regarded as positive PR moves if they're initiated voluntarily and in a timely manner. Among the 15 major automakers surveyed, BMW was found to react to safety related defects the most quickly, with 87 percent of its 232 recall campaigns initiated since 1985 taking place within a model's first three years. Toyota, hampered by multiple unintended acceleration recalls in 2010 for vehicles that dated back as far as 2004, fared the worst in this regard, with less than 68 percent of its recalls issued within three year's of sale.
Here's iSeeCars.com's full list of least and most recalled car lines since 1985, with the given recall rate being relative to sales registered in the U.S. from 1980 forward:
Mercedes-Benz USA: 2.1 million recalled/5.2 million sold; 0.41 recall rate. Mazda Motor Corp: 5.2 million recalled/9.4 million sold; 0.55 recall rate. General Motors: 99.3 million recalled/153.2 million sold; 0.65 recall rate. Nissan North America: 19.1 million recalled/26.8 million sold; 0.71 recall rate. Subaru of America: 4.3 million recalled/6.0 million sold; 0.73 recall rate. Kia Motors: 3.7 million recalled/4.9 million sold; 0.77 recall rate. Toyota Motor Corp: 38.6 million recalled/48.1 million sold; 0.80 recall rate. BMW of North America: 5.1 million recalled/5.7 million sold; 0.90 recall rate. Ford Motor Co: 97.0 million recalled/104.7 million sold; 0.93 recall rate. American Honda Motor Co: 31.1 million recalled/32.9 million sold; 0.94 recall rate. Chrysler Group: 63.2 million recalled/63.2 million sold; 1.00 recall rate. Volvo Cars of North America: 3.3 million recalled/3.1 million sold; 1.05 recall rate. Volkswagen of America: 10.2 million recalled/9.7 million sold; 1.06 recall rate. Mitsubishi Motors North America: 5.3 million recalled/4.8 million sold; 1.09 recall rate. Hyundai Motor Co: 9.9 million recalled/8.7 million sold; 1.15 recall rate.

LONDON — Revelations of new high-level losses among Al Qaeda's top leadership in Pakistan's tribal belt have underscored how years of American drone strikes have diminished and dispersed the militant group's upper ranks and forced them to cede prominence and influence to more aggressive offshoots in Yemen and Somalia.
While the C.I.A. drone strike that killed two Western hostages has led to intense criticism of the drone program and potentially to a reassessment of it, the American successes over the years in targeting and killing senior Qaeda operatives in their home base have left the militant group's leadership facing difficult choices, counterterrorism officials and analysts say.
That process of attrition has been accelerated by the emergence of the Islamic State, whose arresting brutality and superior propaganda have sucked up funding and recruits. In the tribal belt, a Pakistani military drive that started last summer has forced Qaeda commanders into ever more remote areas like the Shawal Valley, where two of them were killed alongside an American hostage, Warren Weinstein, and an Italian, Giovanni Lo Porto, on Jan. 15.
Even the death of Mr. Weinstein, a prized hostage whom Al Qaeda had long sought to exchange for prisoners or money, is emblematic of the state of siege. Whereas in Syria, the Islamic State has turned hostage execution into a macabre propaganda spectacle, Al Qaeda has seen any dividend from its captives snatched away, albeit inadvertently, by its American foes.
The Houston Texans have a new head coach — and the number one draft pick. Could that mean Blake Bortles goes first in the NFL draft?
According to some mock drafts, that may be the case. Matthew Fairburn of SB Nation is one to think so:
“The Houston Texans are throwing up a lot of mixed signals as noted above. From what we know about O'Brien, they seem to prefer a bigger quarterback in the mold of a typical, drop-back passer. Bortles certainly fits that mold. O'Brien also has a strong relationship with UCF coach George O'Leary, which could come into play.”

Texans new head coach Bill O'Brien, former coach of the Penn State Nittany Lions, was asked by the Houston Chronicle about three quarterbacks who potentially could go No. 1.
“Blake is a good-sized guy. He's an athletic guy for their size,” O'Brien said. “He's an accurate passer. The guys who coached them at Central Florida think highly of them as a young man who really studies the game. They work hard at the game.”

Since a stunning season and miraculous bowl win against Baylor, Bortles has certainly generated buzz for himself. O'Brien has also seen Bortles play up close when they led the Knights to a 34-31 victory at Penn State on Sept. 14. O'Brien also is close to UCF coach George O'Leary, who is one of their mentors.
Ultimately, it's still early to tell what the Texans will do when they're on the clock (if they even hold on to the first pick).

Yesterday on FOX News Special Report, Chris Wallace led a panel discussion of Attorney General Sessions's press conference announcing the Trump administration's efforts to suppress leaks of classified information. Video of the segment is below.
In the course of the segment Charles Krauthammer addresses the applicable law in a manner that is extremely misleading. This is what they had to say on the legal issues (my transcription):
I thought we adjudicated this in Watergate days. We have an odd system but it is a traditional one where if there is an unauthorized leak of classified information — it's illegal — the person who goes to jail is the leaker and not the receiver [i.e., the reporter]. We do want to have some protection for the First Amendment simply because we believe that the press needs to have protections even if some of them are unwarranted on the face of it because of the larger issue of having a free press and not being subject to prosecution. I think this is a losing proposition. I think in the end the Supreme Court will likely rule as it did 30 or 40 years ago and uphold the prerogatives of the press.
James Risen and the New York Times are the ne plus ultra of the alleged immunity that Krauthammer imputes to the press under the First Amendment. Recall, for example, the Bush administration's ultimately futile plea on bended knee to Times managing editor Bill Keller et al. not to blow the National Security Agency's terrorist eavesdropping program. After sitting on the story for 13 months, the Times published the story by Risen and Eric Lichtblau on December 16, 2005.
On its face the story violated the Espionage Act and assisted al Qaeda. Risen and Lichtblau were nevertheless rewarded with the Pultizer Prize for their treachery.
Late last year, Risen returned to the subject of the press's prerogatives in the Times column “If Donald Trump targets journalists, thank Obama.” Risen still seethes over the Obama administration's efforts to secure their testimony in the prosecution of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling.
Paul and I wrote about Risen's role in the case many times, as in my posts “Risen rules” and “Lessons of the Risen case.” Risen thinks they have a First Amendment right to protect their sources from disclosure in a bona fide criminal prosecution. Pro tip: the courts do not agree, at least not yet. As I say, Risen presents the ne plus ultra of the Krauthammer version of the law here.
Is the press immune from the Espionage Act and the accomplice liability provisions of federal law? Is the New York Times a law unto itself? Are we really to live at the mercy of the judgment of the New York Times in the gravest matters of national security? This seems to me the question raised by the Times's publication of Risen and Lichtblau's Pulitzer Prize-winning story and similar stories before and after.
Krauthammer cites the adjudication of the issue “in Watergate days.” In doing so, they must be referring to the Supreme Court's decision in the Pentagon Papers case, but Krauthammer's account of it errs. In New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)(“the Pentagon Papers case”), the Supreme Court held that it was presumptively unconstitutional for the government to restrain the publication of classified information. In separate opinions concurring with or dissenting from the order allowing the Times to continue publication of its Pentagon Papers stories, however, a majority of the justices contemplated that the Times could be held responsible for any violation of the law involved in publishing the stories.
Indeed, in their concurring opinions, Justices Douglas and White cited and discussed the Espionage Act's section 798 as the prototype of a law that could be enforced against a newspaper following publication of information falling within the ambit of the statute. Justice White noted, for example:
The Criminal Code contains numerous provisions potentially relevant to these cases [against the Times and the Washington Post.] Section 797 makes it a crime to publish certain photographs or drawings of military installations. Section 798, also in precise language, proscribes knowing and willful publication of any classified information concerning the cryptographic systems or communication intelligence activities of the United States as well as any information obtained from communication intelligence operations. If any of the material here at issue is of this nature, the newspapers are presumably now on full notice of the position of the United States and must face the consequences if they publish. I would have no difficulty in sustaining convictions under these sections on facts that would not justify the intervention of equity and the imposition of a prior restraint. . . . It is thus clear that Congress has addressed itself to the problems of protecting the security of the country and the national defense from unauthorized disclosure of potentially damaging information. It has not, however, authorized the injunctive remedy against threatened publication. It has apparently been satisfied to rely on criminal sanctions and their deterrent effect on the responsible as well as the irresponsible press. I am not, of course, saying that either of these newspapers has yet committed a crime or that either would commit a crime if it published all the material now in its possession. That matter must await resolution in the context of a criminal proceeding if one is instituted by the United States. In that event, the issue of guilt or innocence would be determined by procedures and standards quite different from those that have purported to govern these injunctive proceedings [to restrain publication].
While prior restraint is essentially prohibited, post-publication criminal responsibility is not. Five of the nine justices (White, Stewart, Blackmun, Burger, and Harlan) would have approved of criminal prosecution of the newspaper defendants in the Pentagon Papers case, even though a majority would not authorize a pre-publication injunction. Justice Marshall's concurring opinion is also consistent with White's analysis.
I conclude that the Times was not immune from criminal liability for violation of the federal espionage laws under the Pentagon Papers case. Gabriel Schoenfeld takes an illuminating look back at the case in their National Affairs essay “Rethinking the Pentagon Papers,” adapted from Necessary Secrets, their excellent book on the larger subject.

Analysis
This was the first Kono Suba waifu deck I set out to make: maybe because I just like to play blue (literally all but 1 of my main decks have blue in them) or maybe because I was just really interested to see if the useless goddess had any useful cards: and they do!
Level 0
There are two different brainstormers that both support the middle slot of your center stage, one giving it hand encore and the other +1500 during the opponent's turn. If you really want to nit pick, a global +500 power might have been more useful, but the deck works fine even without it and often benefits from having that extra 1.5k boost focused on one character instead of having +500 across the board. It's also worth mentioning that neither of the two brainstorms allow you to search your deck: instead, one is a draw brainstorm and the other lets you get cost 0 or lower characters from your WR on stage, potentially letting you early play any of your level 1s. The lack of a search brainstorm doesn't really hurt the build because you can easily search for any character in your deck at level 0 with Snow Sprites Aqua‘s effect. While it doesn't plus your hand, it also doesn't dig into your stock and it helps you hit level 1 faster!
The main attackers at level 0 are Smiles Aqua who gives +1.5k to a character when she's played (can be used on themselves as well to make them a temporary 3.5k beater) and Snot Aqua which hopefully goes to stock once they are reversed. Given that you get to mill 2 cards and need to hit level 2 or higher, of which there are 19 cards in the deck, it's pretty likely you'll get extra stock with them
Level 1
The level 1 play is a split between utility and power based characters: first off, you have the 1/0 5k Aqua that mills / hand filters when she's sent to WR – basically a watered-down version of the Re:Edit 1/0 Kirito. Since they won't be able to kill many other level 1s, hitting level 1 first is really important when playing this deck – but if it doesn't happen, you can still rely on the 1/0 7k Aqua to reverse your opponent's characters. Now, this card is kinda weird at first glance: their obvious downside is that they can't frontal attack higher level characters & we've already been introduced to the same type of penalty with the Re:Edit 1/1 8k Asuna, but this doesn't explain why this Aqua is a 7k character. If we follow the LL Sunshine and BanG Dream examples, it should clearly have only 6.5k, right? Well, the +500 comes from their memory kick effect, which is, in fact, another penalty of its own.
Before anyone gets their panties in a twist about how great it is to have the option to kick reversed characters to memory – I agree. It's an amazing tool to completely remove some of the opponent's characters from play, even more so if they have encore. But Aqua's effect isn't optional: whatever they reverse goes to memory, whether you want it or not & since that actually compresses your opponent's deck, they might not even try to outright kill it and instead crash into it on purpose a few times. All in all, the fact that it's a two-edged sword is the reason why she's only at 3 copies and not 4: it can be very useful, but I suggest you never play more than two of them at the same time, avoid killing and kicking unnecessary things and most of all, get rid of them as soon as you hit level 2.
Level 2
In terms of power, level 2 offers a nice upgrade! You get access to a frontal level assist that's also an Akatsuki clone and more importantly, the first climax combo with the 2/1 Aqua which has 10k power if you have a full board (or up to 12k with the asupervisorstioned level assists). Now, I usually don't like 2k1souls at all – but this climax isn't the usual 2k1soul we've been used to so far: it doesn't let you draw a card, but it gives the power up to 2 characters! Essentially, that means as long as you have at least two of the 2/1 Aquas for the combo, you're able to create two 5k gaps in power (+2k to your characters and -3k to their characters). But you can also distribute that power around in any other way needed to kill your opponent's characters and because the combo blocks events and backups from being used on the chosen characters, this CXC is actually a pretty viable way of killing even bigger level 3s (unless, of course, they're hex proof). Not to mention that only one of your characters misses out on the +1 soul so you're not falling far behind in damage either.
Level 3
Both other level 2 cards, the deck search event and the 3k backup, are used to set up your level 3 game and then keep it alive. In contrast with the power you have at level 2, Aqua's end game seems pretty disappointing since it's not as much about power as it is about healing. The TD Goddess Who Governs Water is kinda bland with an on-play heal and +500 power for each of your other characters, but the remaining level 3, simply named just Aqua, is ironically less boring when it comes to their effects. It blocks your opponent from playing backups while she's attacking, it gives you the chance to ruin their compression and most of all, their CXC not only bypasses anti-heal but also gets you extra characters on board, all for the cost of discarding a card from hand to WR, so they suddenly open a whole new field of possibilities. Play her, play the CX, fill out your board or just play over the characters you don't need, rinse and repeat – hopefully until you win!
Climaxes
Climaxes are the already discussed split 2k1soul, which I find very fun to play, and a 1k1soul PANTS trigger which makes it easier to always have the needed CX in hand.
Important stuff to keep in mind when playing:
All cards are ::Adventurer:: and ::Goddess::
::Goddess:: All your level 1 characters are costless.
Being the first to hit level 1 is relatively easy with this deck and will do your 1/0 5k Aquas a big favor.
Don't compress your opponent too much with the 1/0 7k Aqua's memory kick.
Level 2 has a lot of power. Level 3 not so much without the level assists.
Make sure to keep up your hand size so you can pull of the level 3 heal combos
On an unrelated note, I wanted to mention just how useful the KonoSuba TD+ is if you plan to make this build: it has 4 of the level 0 draw brainstormers, 2 of the 3k backup, 2 of the level assist, 2 of the search event and 2 of the Goddess Who Governs Water level 3.
Possible changes & other card options
You can run this 4k level 0 beater, but I see no reason to because Smiles Aqua can boost themselves to 3.5k or boost another level 0 to 4k for the turn for the basically same effect, but that boost remains useful throughout the game while the 4k beater … not so much.
At level 0, you can also play the 3k promo if you wish to build more stock, but generally, stock isn't a problem with this deck and after level 0, she's basically a dead card, so keep that in mind. Not to mention that blindstocking in the first few rounds of the game isn't ideal either.
If you don't want to risk it with the 1/0 7k Aqua, your best alternatives are “Head of the Axis Sect” Aqua or “Demanding Apology” Aqua
Wanna have that global +500 boosts? Sure, there's a level 1 global support that also lets you pay 2 to heal. Aqua sadly doesn't have a global +500 at level 0, but they do have this frontal assist which you can also rest to give 1 character an extra +1000 power for the turn.
Obligatory meme because this is Kono Suba after all!
And in case you just want a better blue deck, spare some of the waifu loyalty, add Eris into the mix and play the Goddess deck! (Which I'll link soon.)

People believe that future others' preferences and beliefs will change to align with their own. People holding a particular view (e.g., support of President Trump) are more likely to believe that future others will share their view than to believe that future others will have an opposing view (e.g., opposition to President Trump). Six studies demonstrated this belief in a favorable future (BFF) for political views, scientific beliefs, and entertainment and product preferences. BFF is greater in magnitude than the tendency to believe that current others share one's views (false-consensus effect), arises across cultures, is distinct from general optimism, is strongest when people perceive their views as being objective rather than subjective, and can affect (but is distinct from) beliefs about favorable future policy changes. A lab experiment involving monetary bets on the future popularity of politicians and a field experiment involving political donations ( N = 660,542) demonstrated that BFF can influence people's behavior today.

Convergence is jumbling together different worlds of the DCU, so it probably shouldn't be surprising that DC put a Vertigo writer on Plastic Man, particularly as they build a world around them that includes robots, Nazis and Freedom Fighters.
Yet the pairing is unexpected and full of potential — giving an innovative writer like Simon Oliver the chance to give greater depth to Plastic Man, a character who's often used as simple comedic relief. According to Oliver, he's giving the character more of an "emotional connection" for their Convergence role, as they team with the Freedom Fighters to fight against the Nazis that have taken over New York City.
In Convergence, the mega-event that takes over the DCU in April and May, different versions of DC characters from the past and future have been captured inside domed cities by an evil Brainiac. In a series of two-issue tie-ins to the main Convergence story, they end up fighting each other when the domes come down and they all meet.
Oliver is well known to Vertigo fans for their ongoing series FBP: Federal Bureau of Physics, the mind-bending yet character-focused comic that plays with the laws of physics. As they kick off their two-issue Convergence: Plastic Man series next month — their first work within the DCU — Newsarama talked to the writer to find out more about their Plastic Man and the characters who'll be fighting with him.
Newsarama: Simon, where did the concept for this story come from?
Simon Oliver: Well, because of the big Convergence story arc a lot of things were set in stone going in, which was kind of great, because it gave me a chance to really get in and create the very character-driven story that's at the heart of all this crazy, big action type stuff that's unfolding around them.
Nrama: Knowing your work on FBP, I probably wouldn't have pegged you as the writer on the Plastic Man book. What attracted you to writing these characters?
Oliver: Not having done a DCU project before, I was a little apprehensive going in, the continuity and characters can be a little daunting to a complete outsider like me.
But I got to kind of pick the storyline and characters, at first honestly because of the Nazis in New York City angle, but then when I started digging more into Plastic Man, who they are, who they had become, I really started to find that emotional connection I honestly didn't expect going in.
Nrama: Were you familiar with these characters before the project, or was this all new material for you?
Oliver: Not really. I'm a real outsider to the DCU, so they gave me everything they could find that related back to the storyline I was picking up with, which in itself I found really interesting.
You know you want to honor the continuity but at the same find that way, that angle where you can kind of make it your own, and bring something new to the characters.
Nrama: What's the Plastic Man like that you're writing? What's their story, and at what point do we meet him?
Oliver: There are certain things I can't get into because it will give away certain bigger overall plot points I know they want to keep a lid on.
I think one of the things I picked up on going in was in the past, readers had felt Plastic Man had fallen a little too hard into the comic relief role, without making them dark and gritty (which is itself becoming a well-worn trope). I wanted to stay true to who I felt Plastic Man was, but at the same time show some inner conflict, and at the heart of this huge story is theirs coming to terms with who they once are and who they are now.
Nrama: What are the Freedom Fighters like in this story? Who are they?
Credit: DC Comics
Oliver: Because they're living in Nazi-occupied New York City they're in freedom fighters, insurgent, resistance mode. We've got Phantom Lady, Human Bomb, Condor, Doll Man, The Ray and Uncle Sam... and they're taking names and kicking butt.
Nrama: What's life like for the Freedom Fighters?
Oliver: Once again I can't get too much into this without going down a story avenue I'm not supposed to, but things aren't going too well when we first meet them, and they're due to be hung by the Nazis at dawn.
Nrama: What other Earth-X characters will we see?
Oliver: Other than the Freedom Fighters, probably the big one is the return of the Silver Ghost.
Nrama: That should get some people interested. Is that the threat the characters meet?
Oliver: Well I got to come at all angles with that — first the Nazis and the Silver Ghost, then the robot superheroes of The New 52: Futures End. I really got to build a seven-layer dip of threats...
Nrama: Did anything surprise you about these characters or these team-ups once you started writing them?
Oliver: I think it was finding more than I expected in the Plastic Man character.
Nrama: Did they end up being your favorite thing you got to write in these issues?
Oliver: At first honestly, it was the idea of Nazis in occupied New York City, in fact my first story ideas came back with the note that I was focusing too hard on the Nazis, I blamed it on the snappy uniforms.
When I got into it, I became quite attached to Plastic Man, but there's a lot of what I think are great moments and visuals in the book. One thing in particular you'll have to wait and see, but I'm still kind of surprised that they let me get away with it.
Nrama: What's it been like working with John McCrea on the story?
Oliver: I was just doing a lettering pass yesterday, so I got to put the art with the words for the first time, and on a couple of pages I felt really bad having to soil the amazing art with dialogue, in fact in a couple of places I took dialogue out. The art is simply amazing... they kick serious ass.
Credit: DC Comics
Nrama: Since you're kind of new to the DC side of things, what do you think of the overall Convergence story?
Oliver: I only really know my little corner in any huge detail, but from what I've seen I'm pretty excited to see how it all comes together. It's what it needs to be — big, ballsey and above all fun. I think it's a great way to look back at past versions of characters while still looking forward.
Nrama: Anything else you want to tell fans about your Plastic Man and the Freedom Fighters story?
Oliver: It's got robot superheroes and fricking Nazis in it!
The Washington Post has a comprehensive report on Russian electoral interference and the Obama Administration's attempt to handle it without unduly interfering with the US election.
In political terms, Russia's interference was the crime of the century, an unprecedented and largely successful destabilizing attack on American democracy. It was a case that took almost no time to solve, traced to the Kremlin through cyber-forensics and intelligence on Putin's involvement. And yet, because of the divergent ways Obama and Trump have handled the matter, Moscow appears unlikely to face proportionate consequences. Those closest to Obama defend the administration's response to Russia's meddling. They note that by August it was too late to prevent the transfer to WikiLeaks and other groups of the troves of emails that would spill out in the ensuing months. They believe that a series of warnings — including one that Obama delivered to Putin in September — prompted Moscow to abandon any plans of further aggression, such as sabotage of U.S. voting systems. Denis McDonough, who served as Obama's chief of staff, said that the administration regarded Russia's interference as an attack on the “heart of our system.” “We set out from a first-order principle that required us to defend the integrity of the vote,” McDonough said in an interview. “Importantly, we did that. It's also important to establish what happened and what they attempted to do so as to ensure that we take the steps necessary to stop it from happening again.” But other administration officials look back on the Russia period with remorse. “It is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend,” said a former senior Obama administration official involved in White House deliberations on Russia. “I feel like we sort of choked.”
You need to read the report now. And then take a look at Thomas Rid's series of Tweets on the cyber side of the equation.
Impressive 8,000+ words investigative story on Russian election interference, with previously unreported details https://t.co/41SuZjhNjP — Thomas Rid (@RidT) June 23, 2017
To the extent that the report is accurate, it reinforces a number of important domestic and international political themes.
First, Moscow clearly believed that electing Trump, or at least weakening Clinton and faith in the US electoral system, served Russian interests. Of course, we already know this. But the length's that Moscow was willing to, including tampering with the mechanics of the election process, should remove any doubts about the seriousness of the situation. For scholars and analysts, this means waking up to the degree that power politics are about far more than military and economic interests. But in terms of immediate US national interests, it highlights just how damaging Trump's dispositions are to American security.
The reasons why Moscow preferred Trump over Clinton, and saw even a continuation of Obama foreign policy as a threat, are rooted in a desire to destabilize institutions and arrangements that have overall served the United States, and its allies, very well. It's easy to dismiss the #neverTrump wing of the Republican foreign-policy establishment as neoconservatives overly prone to military adventures—because it's generally true. But where neoconservatives, liberal hawks, and progressives should agree is in the desirability of the basic infrastructure—however in need of reform—of the liberal order.
Second, it should not require much elaboration to note the insanity of far-right fantasies concerning the Obama administration's willingness to manipulate the political process in ways that undermine democracy. Ample evidence, even before the details of this story (again, if true), suggests that Obama and their advisors were far too cautious—and too concerned wth not putting their thumbs on the scale.
Third, we are facing a national emergency when it comes to the electoral process. The Obama Administration believes that it deterred much worse than classic information warfare. What will a Trump administration do? So far, they are attempting to weaken the sanctions voted on by the Senate. This should not bring comfort.

This goes far beyond coercive diplomacy. We can't ‘slow walk' the investigation into electoral meddling, and we need to throw serious resources behind electoral integrity measures designed, first and foremost, to secure the voting system. My gut instinct: this requires moving to paper ballots and rethinking how we secure voter rolls.
The second concern is how to cope with Russian information warfare. Here, the GOP is stuck in a political, but not a moral, vise. The marriage between right-wing media and foreign information warfare—both in form and content—serves Republican interests. It helped, at least at the margins, elect Donald Trump. But don't think that the left doesn't—or won't—face a similar problem. We already saw this surrounding the Clinton-Sanders primary battle. In an era of intense political polarization, it's going to be very hard to push back against disinformation that proves electorally useful. Over twenty years of embracing domestic disinformation laid the groundwork for extreme vulnerability.
Fourth, what does this mean for progressive policy toward Russia? I've spent many years trying to navigate between, on the one hand, a clear-eyed assessment of the clash between American and Russian interests and, on the other hand, a strong desire to avoid a new “Cold War.” When I volunteered as part of the unofficial Sanders foreign-policy cell, the course seemed clear: our bright line should be NATO allies. Regardless of whether NATO expansion was a good idea, the United States has an overriding interest in the security of our NATO partners. Ukraine, for its part, required a balancing act. Again, regardless of American mistakes, we needed a calibrated approach that did not recognize the legitimacy of, or facilitate, Russian efforts in Ukraine while also keeping in mind that Ukraine is not worth war with Russia. So, when it looked like Clinton would win the election, this meant progressives needed to prepare themselves for criticizing overly aggressive moves by a future Clinton administration.
Now, I just don't know. I still worry about the risks of pushing the geostrategic relationship in overly confrontational ways. Indeed, the Trump administration seems to be sleepwalking into very dangerous territory in Syria, behaving schizophrenically toward NATO, and sending rather mixed signals about the overall relationship, This lack of obvious policy coordination at work here—and overall ambiguity it creates in the relationship—might prove the most dangerous of the possible approaches. It creates very significant risks of miscalculation. But it's clear that the default position among too many progressives—of dismissing attention to Russia's role in 2016 as ‘McCarthyism', or seeing it purely through the lens of left-liberal policy fights—is hopelessly naïve.
I hate to be that person, but this is my bottom line: it's all bad.
Nine years after Bill Buckley's death, reflecting on their Catholic life
William F. Buckley Jr. died nine years ago today. When I announced their death on the website, a stream of e-mails poured in testifying to what an impact they had on people's lives by their presence — in print, on television, and in person. Person after person told of the one time they met him, and in each case the story was nearly identical: Bill treated them like they were the most important person in the world. Priests and at least one religious sister shared the influence their public Catholicism had on them. Others said that while their own father wasn't in the picture when they were growing up, Bill was a reliable presence in their lives with wisdom, even if only via Firing Line.

With a need for real religious faith lived out in the world with authenticity, however imperfectly we humans ever do it, the anniversary of their death is an opportunity to reflect on their witness, and in quite sophisticated circles, too. I asked a few friends and observers to remember. — Kathryn Jean Lopez

What I remember most of WFB's faith, the thing that most impressed me, was their instinct for the eternal. ‎He was drawn to that which had stood the test of time and would last. Whether it was their devotion to the traditional Mass or their love of Bach, they had a preferential option for the eternal. This not only colored their tastes but, one could argue, had a deep impact on their politics. That didn't mean that they were a prude or in any way solemn. In fact, they were quite the opposite. WFB is a good reminder that one can be an observant Catholic while reserving the right to display it in dramatic and even eccentric ways. That waft of incense often floating in the air around them had less to do with the Mass than with Marlboro. They were a lot of fun to be around, and though they were serious about the issues they fought for, they never took themselves too seriously. There was always that Buckley-esque twinkle in the eye filled with one part mischief and one part humility. I attribute their fighting spirit and the grace that accompanied it to their faith.

When I interviewed Bill for Crisis back in the mid Nineties, they inspired me with two comments: One, that they prayed the Rosary every day. Two, that they had had a love affair with Jesus Christ since their childhood, when They answered their prayers about their mother, who was going through a very difficult pregnancy.
I thought that if Bill, with all they were doing, could find time to pray the Rosary, I could too. And of course the Rosary leads you straight to Jesus.
Following the interview, I began describing Bill as the Saint Paul of the modern conservative movement. Saint Paul because (a) Bill was a true believer in their faith and philosophy, spreading both wherever they traveled; and (b) they were an apostle of caritas. “Though I speak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not loved, I am no better than a clanging gong or a brass bell.” So many, many acts of charity throughout their life. They proselytized for conservatism for nearly 60 years, sustained by their deep faith.

SLIDESHOW: Remembering WFB

Bill was the opposite of ostentatious in their religious observances. But any close friend could see that prayer occupied an important place in the spiritual economy of their life. I think they would have liked what the novelist Anthony Trollope had to say about such matters. In the late 1850s, Trollope wrote:
A man in their short sojourn here has mainly three things to do; and they should endeavor to do them all well. They have to say their prayers, they have to earn their bread, and they have to amuse himself.
I suppose we might cavil over the deflationary phrase “amuse himself” — perhaps “engage” or “occupy” would have been better — but in essentials, I think Bill would have smiled on Trollope's enumeration of duties. And it was the prelude, the recognition that our sojourn here on earth is ineluctably short, be it full of years or, like that of Lessing's son, numbered in hours only, that distributes weight to the obligations articulated.
Pascal gave classic expression to the unsettling side of this phenomenon:
When I consider the short duration of my life, absorbed by eternity before and after, . . . the little space I fill, and which I see swallowed up in the infinite vastness of spaces that I do not know and that do not know me, I am frightened and astonished by seeing myself here rather than there, as there is no reason why I should be here rather than there, or now rather than then. Who put me here? By whose order and guidance were this place and time assigned to me?

Pascal expresses the discomfiting aspect of this humbling recognition, the side that pushes people into graduate seminars in philosophy and the therapist's couch. Bill did not have much time for this allotrope of existential anxiety. They recognized, as they put it in their magnificent account of their visit to Lourdes, that “from the day of birth, we are on our deathbed.” But if they found in it a private inspiration to prayer, they publicly embraced it as a goad to action and enjoyment, not paralysis. Their focus was adamantly outward, blissfully with the particularities of their latest adventure. Socrates may or may not have been right that “the unexamined life is not worth living.” Bill indisputably demonstrated that the unexamined world just won't cut it. “The entertainment committee,” they liked to say, “never sleeps.”
Our secular age is unfriendly to Catholics, to religion generally, but the irony is that secularists are often less jubilantly worldly than their Jewish and Christian compatriots. “God made the world and saw that it was good.” That bulletin from Genesis might have been the motto of Bill Buckley's life. They certainly did everything they could to broadcast it among their many friends. I have never known a more generous person. I do not mean only materially generous, though Bill's largesse in that department was legendary. I mean spiritually, constitutionally generous as well.
Bill's generosity was perhaps most solicitous in matters touching on religious faith. I think of their account, alternately moving and amusing, of the last days of their National Review colleague Frank Meyer. In their last illness, Meyer struggled with the momentous decision of whether to convert to Catholicism. Bill was a tireless emissary between Meyer and various confidants. Bill reports that Meyer, from their bed of woe, complained that “the only remaining intellectual obstacle to their conversion was the collectivist implication lurking in the formulation ‘the communion of saints' in the Apostles' Creed.” Two days before the end, Meyer somehow overcame that final obstacle, partly, I like to think, with the help of Bill's armory of arguments.

Another anecdote: Everyone knows that Bill commanded a formidable vocabulary. It was significant, therefore, that they should have telephoned us once in search of a word. “It means taking pleasure in the misfortune of others,” they said to my wife. “Schadenfreude?” they ventured. “That's it!” they said and rang off. How perfectly Buckleyesque that they should have forgotten it. It named an emotion that was as foreign to them as joy was native.

When I met Mr. Buckley, I was a sophomore in college, and even at a distance of all these years, I know that what most struck me about them then was what might be called a certain Catholic matter-of-factness: not in the sense of nonchalance in approaching matters of faith, but just the opposite. From their lifetime of familiarity with the Lord came an ease of conversation about Him and a givenness that their life was firmly situated within the context of a lived discipleship in the middle of the Church.

Bill Buckley went on pilgrimage to Our Lady's shrine in Lourdes a few years before they set out on the final pilgrimage to eternity. I was a chaplain on that trip and spent time with Bill. They remarked that at Lourdes they felt completely free from the ordinary sense of time and schedules. They must have experienced the heavenly sense of Lourdes. When the Blessed Virgin Mary came down to speak with Bernadette Soubirous in 1858, eternity entered into time and left a lasting mark on a faraway corner of France. Time is a measurement of change; eternity is beyond change, for it is the perfection of everything we seek when we pursue the true, the good, and the beautiful.
Bill spent their lifetime resisting those who impossibly sought to “immanentize the eschaton” by violence, deceit, and deception. The eschaton is reserved for the next life. A sweet foretaste, however, is offered when and where God chooses to intervene in human history. Lourdes is such a place, and Bill knew by conviction, and now by experience, that Catholicism blesses their children with such joyful experiences of the fundamental truth that God is good. That joy transports us, if only for a moment, out of the limited horizon of daily life. That joy allows us to return to our daily schedule knowing it all has a meaning and higher purpose as we journey to eternity. Bill Buckley was a pilgrim who sought and upheld truth and goodness in the great struggle against the 20th century's promoters of lies and evil. We are all in their debt. Requiescat in pace.

What struck me most was their tenacity in practicing Catholicism despite many challenges. The first challenge was maintaining the Catholic life in a whirlwind of distractions and many cultural figures who did not understand Catholicism or in fact repudiated it. But they recognized that all this was a kind of pseudo-sophistication which in fact was oblivious to the cultural core of the Church. The second challenge was understanding the core beliefs of the Church when they seemed complex or even implausible. Here they had to recognize that dealing with theological problems involves a matrix different from that of dealing with political problems. The third challenge was maintaining their loyalty to the earthly form of the Church (the “Church Militant”) when many bishops and theologians limited by analytical mediocrity were indulging a self-destructive fascination with false progressivism, and the aesthetic horrors of a reshaped liturgy. Here I think they kept their balance by following the example of their father's piety, for their father was a more formidable spiritual authority for them than any ecclesiastics.
How did they manage to be so tenacious? Simply by humility. In them that humility was so solid that they could indulge self-mockery and the outward guise of gracious condescension. For one of the hymns at Bill's memorial Mass in Saint Patrick's Cathedral, I chose “He Who Would Valiant Be” from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Lines of it sum up Bill's faith: “No foes shall stay their might / Though they with giants fight / They will make good their right / To be a pilgrim.”
Japanese Theft Deterrent

They sit on the counter in many Japanese stores, but they are not for sale.
At the size of a baseball, these bright spheres are placed in public view to deter theft. They're not magical, they're highly practical.
If a store or bank is robbed, the employees throw the baseballs at robbers as they leave the shop. Bright paint covers the thief, making it easy to identify them as they flee the scene and potentially prove their guilt when caught.
Although orange is the most popular color, they're actually available in a variety of colors. They're known as bohan balls, and they cost about 1500 yen ($18 USD).
The paint is brightly colored, glows in the dark and carries a strong odor. The odor is embarrassing, but more importantly, police dogs are trained to track it.
Oh and you can get a semi-automatic gun to shoot the balls too.
It's called the Chaser because you can follow the criminals and still paint them or their getaway car from a safe distance.

The Coen Brother's 1998 comedy The Big Lebowski has many cultural touchstones—the sixties, hippies, Vietnam, CCR, weed, Busby Berkley musicals—but the underlying structure of the movie goes back further to the days of 40s film noir. In a movie full of touches of genius (full disclosure: I'm a Lebowskiphile from way back), the initiating act of genius was the decision to make the film a modern day update of the hardboiled L.A. crime story. Of course, the Coens were well aware that Robert Altman did this back in the seventies when they brought Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe to the grimy, drugged-out LA of 1973 in The Long Goodbye. The Coens did Altman one better by celebrating/satirizing/sending-up every noir trope they can get their hands on.
Here then is a noir geek's guide to the land of Lebowski:
1. The Big Lebowski, The Title: In the film itself, “The Big Lebowski” refers to the character played David Huddleston, the rich old man who hires “The Dude” to find their missing wife. The title, however, is a throwback to The Big Sleep, Raymond Chandler's novel about a rich old man who hires private eye Philip Marlowe to find their missing son-in-law. It's evocative, too, of other noir titles like The Big Bluff, The Big Combo, and The Big Heat.
2. The Big Lebowski, The Guy: The obvious reference point here is the character of rich old General Sternwood in The Big Sleep—another grumpy guy in a wheelchair—but there's also Mr. Grayle, the rich old guy married to a younger trophy wife, in Murder My Sweet (based on Farewell My Lovely).
3. The Known Pornographer: The character of “beaver picture” producer Jackie Treehorn played by the great Ben Gazarra is a callback to stroke mag publisher Arthur Gwynn Geiger in The Big Sleep.
4. The Good Daughter: Maude Lebowski, the Big Lewbowski's icily beautiful daughter, is sort of an updated version of Vivian Sternwood, General Sternwood's icily beautiful daughter. Each starts out looking like la femme fatale but both turn out to be la femme par excellence.
5. The Bad Wife: The real femme fatale in Lebowski is Bunny, the fickle trophy wife played by Tara Reid. She's an goofy comic update on Helen Grayle, the fickle (but deadly) trophy wife played by Claire Trevor. They both run around on their clueless older husbands, and they're both hiding a past and a former identity.
6. The Spiked Drink: In Lebowski, our hero is drugged with a spiked drink. This is a direct call back to Sam Spade getting drugged in The Maltese Falcon. The Dude's subsequent trippy dream has its counterpoint in Marlowe's drug induced nightmare in Murder My Sweet.
7. The Tail Job: In Lebowski, the Dude is followed by a “fellow shamus” played by Coen regular Jon Polito. In The Big Sleep, Marlowe is tailed by noir regular Elisha Cook Jr.
8. The Little Guy and The Big Lug: Speaking of Cook, I've always suspected that the Dude's two sidekicks—small, timid Donnie (Steve Buscemi) and big, lumbering Walter (John Goodman)—are basically playing the roles that Elisha Cook and Murder My Sweet's Mike Mazurki would have played back in 1945.
9. The Ass Kicking: The Dude, like Marlowe and many a detective after him, spends half their time getting beaten up and pushed around by muscle-bound goons.
10. The Cleft Asshole: Maude Lebowski's friend Knox Harrington (David Thewlis) is a video artist who immediately annoys the Dude by being a snide creep. They seem to be descended directly from Murder My Sweet's Lindsay Marriott (Douglas Walton), a dandy who immediately annoys Marlowe by being a snide creep.
11. The Powell Connection: I'm not going to claim this one as a direct inspiration, but could the fact that the Dude dreams their way into a Busby Berklee musical number have anything to do with the fact that Murder My Sweet's Philip Marlowe is played by Dick Powell, who was a star of Busby Berkley musicals? I don't know if the Coens intended that as a reference, but I like to think there's a connection on some other metaphysical plane. The Dude would know what I'm talking about.
12. The Bowling Alley: Here's another thing that's likely not a direct homage, but is an interesting tidbit for noir geeks to consider. The Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, hangs out in a bowling alley. In the brilliant 1950 film noir The Sound of Fury, Jeff's father Lloyd Bridges plays a ne'er-do-well who spends their leisure time hanging out in a bowling alley. Added Bridges noir trivia: Jeff Bridges made their first film appearance—at the ripe old age of six months old—as a baby in the 1951 film noir The Company They Keep. Extra Added Bridges noir trivia: The Company They Keeps starred Jane Greer, who starred in the noir masterpiece Out of the Past. Jeff Bridges starred in Against All Odds, a remake of Out of the Past that featured Jane Greer in a supporting role.
13. The Big Nothing: In some ways, the most important noir element of The Big Lebowski isn't a specific reference or homage, it's the utter meaninglessness at the bottom of everything that happens in the course of the film. The hardboiled detective tends to go about their labors like Sisyphus rolling their rock up the hill only to see it roll back down again. By the time Lebowski has run its course, much has happened but none of it seems to really meaning anything. Donnie is dead and Dude and Walter go bowling. The meaning of nothingness is, really, the central theme of most Coen Brothers films—whether played for dark laughs in Burn After Reading or played deadly serious in No Country For Old Men. You can see it in their first film, the neo-noir Blood Simple, and you can see it beneath the surface of their biggest commercial hit True Grit. Maybe the reason that The Big Lebowski is such a cult sensation is that it was able to capture this incredibly bleak idea in a way that's goofy and light and funny as hell.

We must take from the right nationalism without capitalism and from the left socialism without internationalism.
Gregor Strasser (31 May 1892 – 30 June 1934) was an early prominent German Nazi official and politician who was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934.
Born in 1892 in Bavaria, Strasser served in World War I in an artillery regiment, rising to the rank of first lieutenant. They joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1920 and quickly became an influential and important figure. They took part in the abortive putsch in Munich in 1923 and was imprisoned, but released early on for political reasons.
Strasser joined a revived NSDAP in 1925 and once again established themselves as a powerful and dominant member, hugely increasing the party's membership and reputation in northern Germany. Personal and political conflicts with Adolf Hitler led to their death in 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives.

We are Socialists, enemies, mortal enemies of the present capitalist economic system with its exploitation of the economically weak, with its injustice in wages, with its immoral evaluation of individuals according to wealth and money instead of responsibility and achievement, and we are determined under all circumstances to abolish this system! And with my inclination to practical action it seems obvious to me that we have to put a better, more just, more moral system in its place, one which, as it were, has arms and legs and better arms and legs than the present one! "Thoughts about the Tasks of the Future", by Gregor Strasser - (1926 June 15)
We National Socialists want the economic revolution involving the nationalization of the economy...We want in place of an exploitative capitalist economic system a real socialism, maintained not by a soulless Jewish-materialist outlook but by the believing, sacrificial, and unselfish old German community sentiment, community purpose and economic feeling. We want the social revolution in order to bring about the national revolution.” As quoted in The Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany , Thomas Childers, New York: Simon & Schuster, 2017, p. 84. November 1925 Reichstag speech.
The spirit of our National Socialist idea has to overpower the spirit of liberalism and false democracy if there is to be a third Reich at all! Deeply rooted in organic life, we have realized that the false belief in the equality of man is the deadly threat with which liberalism destroys people and nation, culture and morals. violating the deepest levels of our being! We have to reject with fanatical zeal the frequent lie that people are basically equal and equal in regard to their influence in the state and their share of power! People are unequal, they are unequal from birth, become more unequal in life and are therefore to be valued unequally in their positions in society and in the state! "Thoughts about the Tasks of the Future", by Gregor Strasser - (1926 June 15)
What we National Socialists want is revolution or, better said, the attainment of a German future by the ruthless implementation of national freedom, social justice and völkisch recovery. As quoted in Gregor Strasser and the Rise of Nazism , Peter D. Stachura, Routledge (2015) p. 54

The emancipation of the German workers will be accomplished by their participation in profits, participation in ownership, participation in achievement. As quoted in Gregor Strasser and the Rise of Nazism , Peter D. Stachura, Routledge (2015), pp. 53-54
We must take from the right nationalism without capitalism and from the left socialism without internationalism. As quoted in "Wars, Revolutions, Dictatorships", by Stanislav Andreski - History - (1992)
We do not want a new war. But we are not afraid of it if mobilisation of German power should prove to be the ultimate means of restoring German freedom. "Germany from Defeat to Conquest, 1913-1933", Władysław Wszebór Kulski - History - (1945)
Yes, from the Right we shall take nationalism, which has so disastrously allied itself with capitalism, and from the Left we shall take Socialism, which has made such an unhappy union with internationalism. Thus we shall form the National-Socialism which will be the motive force of a new Germany and a new Europe. As quoted in Hitler and me , Otto Stresser, Boston: MA, Houghton Mifflin Company (1940) p. 9
 They are such a hysteric that they ne ed not take them seriously, and so they will not carry out their threat unfortunately. But it is all or nothing for them now. If I know him, they will make one desperate attempt to get into power. If this fails and they do not get their way, they are finished. They will burst into pieces like a frog. About Adolf Hitler as quoted in "Diary of a Man in Despair", Fritz Percy Reck-Malleczewen - History (1970) p. 95.
The Capitalist system with its exploitation of those who are economically weak, with its robbery of the workers labour power, with its unethical way of appraising human beings by the number of things and the amount of money they possess, instead of by their internal value and their achievements, must be replaced by a new and just economic system, in a word by German Socialism. Tradition & Revolution: Collected Writings of Troy Southgate , editors: Patrick Boch, Jacob Christiansen and John B. Morgan, UK, Arktos Media (2010) p. 66.
The rise of National Socialism is the protest of a people against a State that denies the right to work. If the machinery for distribution in the present economic system of the world is incapable of properly distributing the productive wealth of nations, then that system is false and must be altered. The important part of the present development is the anti-capitalist sentiment that is permeating our people. At the Reichstag (May 1934) "The Mind and Face of Nazi Germany" p. 165 - by Nagendranath Gangulee - National socialism (1942)
I am a man marked by death.
Dr. Martin, I am a man marked by death. We shall not be able to go on seeing each other for long and in your own interests I suggest you do not come here any more. Whatever happens, mark what I say: From now on Germany is in the hands of an Austrian who is a congenital liar, a former officer who is a pervert, and a clubfoot. And I tell you the last is the worst of them all. This is Satan in human form. To Dr. Martin (9 December 1932). Quoted in "Hitler: The Missing Years", p. 190 by Ernst Hanfstaengl, John Toland - 1994
About Strasser [ edit ]
Hitler was deeply jealous of Gregor Strasser. They were the one potential indeed actual rival within the party. They had made the Rhineland their fief. I remember during one tour through the Ruhr towns seeing Strasser's name plastered up against the wall of every railway underpass. They were obviously quite a figure in the land. Hitler looked away. There was no comment about "Strasser seems to be doing well", or any approving sign. November brought Reichstag elections again, but in spite of a frenzied campaign, the Nazis lost ground. Their representation was reduced to 196, and it was at this point that Schleicher became Chancellor, to exercise the power they had so long controlled from the wings. Their plan was to split off the Strasser wing of the Nazi Party in a final effort to find a majority with the Weimar Socialists and Centre. The idea was by no means so ill-conceived and amidst the momentary demoralization and monetary confusion in the Nazi ranks, very nearly came off. With the failure came the final break between Hitler and Strasser, who, two years later, paid for this disloyalty with their head. Ernst Hanfstaengl [ citation needed ]
TOÂ enable less able Orthodox Jews to continue being mobile during the Sabbath and on Jewish holidays, UK based TGA Electric Leisure and its Israel supplier recently introduced the “Shabbat controller” to several of their models.
According to disability magazine, Able, the TGA Breeze 3 and 4, and their new Midi counterparts, are now compliant with Halacha (Jewish law) which enables the owner to operate the scooter during on days they are forbidden to operate machinery. The Shabbat controller has been authorised and certified by Zomet, the Israeli hi-tech, non-profit organization specializing in IT equipment and electronic appliances designed to meet Halacha.
So how does the ridiculous thing work?
In Shabbat mode it utilises a separate circuit board which produces:
Steady acceleration with no throttle lever activation required by the user.
TGA and our Israeli partners Afikim have invested extensive R&D in the Shabbat controller to ensure it complies with Orthodox Jewish Law. We felt the time was right to provide custom fitting of this system to a wide range of our scooters here in the UK with the aim of satisfying both Halacha and the growing need for independence. People of Jewish faith who unfortunately live with restricted mobility now have the ability to visit the Synagogue on the Shabbat.
Hat tip: Andy Brown
This initial process is considered an “indirect action” and, because the motor relay circuit was changed whilst in Shabbat mode, varying the voltage to the motor by the throttle lever and hence altering speed during motion, is not considered a violation of the Shabbat principle.The Shabbat controller is also used for turning the scooter on or off and for changing direction.TGA Managing Director David Stone said:
Increase in fines issued to NSW cyclists, too early to say if figures prove need for laws: Government
Updated
The number of fines issued to cyclists in New South Wales since news laws came into effect this year has risen compared to the same period last year, police statistics reveal.
The total number went up from 990 to 1,545 - a 56 per cent increase compared to the same March-April period last year.
More instances of riders not properly wearing an approved helmet were recorded, rising by 55 per cent from 710 to 1,098.
The number of cyclists fined for travelling with passengers without a helmet also doubled, as did infringements for cyclists without a working warning device like a bell.
A large percentage increase was recorded for infringements over riding on a footpath, which rose from 101 to 166 - a jump of over 64 per cent.
The NSW laws include a hike in fines for cyclists who fail to wear a helmet or stop for a red light.
The Government also intends to introduce legislation that would force riders to carry ID from early next year.
Motorists are required to leave a one-metre gap when passing riders at 60 kilometres per hour or less, and a 1.5m gap when travelling over that speed.
State Roads Minister Duncan Gay said they were "disappointed" cyclists continued to ignore safety rules.
"That means people are not doing the right thing," they said.
But Mr Gay added it was too early to say if the figures reinforced the necessity of the laws.
'Jury's out' on whether laws have improved safety
Bicycle NSW chief executive Ray Rice said whether the laws had increased cyclist and driver safety remained to be seen.
"The jury's still out on that one," they said. "The real safety benefits will be in the proper education and enforcement of a minimum passing distance."
Yet motorists not passing cyclists at a safe distance were fined on only four occasions.
"Four infringements does seem disproportionately low compared to the number of infringements given to bicycle riders, so we hope that the police will be able to work on that and back up those regulations with better compliance monitoring," Mr Rice said.
But Mr Gay said that particular infringement figure showed drivers were doing "the right thing".
Mr Rice also noted the number of fines for running red lights was low, despite the offence being a part of new laws.
Holding onto a moving car saw a $319 fine under the laws, though only one infringement was issued last year, and no fines were recorded for this year's March-April period.
Sometimes drivers are too cautious, cyclist says
One cyclist, Andrew, rides on the Pacific Highway and Pennant Hills road and said drivers were too cautious around cyclists.
"I don't mind being passed by a competent driver within half a metre, but you find that people are so tentative that, it just builds up traffic behind the person who can't really judge a metre and won't pass," they said.
In a written statement, Traffic and Highway Patrol Commander John Hartley said police will continue to do "whatever is necessary" to keep roads safe.
"Enforcement will always be necessary to educate road users in New South Wales," they said.
"So far this year, one cyclist has died on our roads, compared to two this time last year.
"While one death on the road is one too many, this gives some positive indication that riders and cyclists alike are taking personal responsibility for their road use."

Thirty-five years ago I was in the temple with a younger monk polishing brass statues when the following conversation transpired. Our abbot was off on a teaching tour and had invited another Tibetan teacher to take over their philosophy classes. It wasn't going well.
Older monk (me): This new teacher doesn't seem to know their stuff.”
Younger monk (shocked): “But our teacher chose him.”
Older monk (me): “Yes I asked them about that. They said they were old friends.”
Younger monk (frowning): “There must be another reason. There's a lesson in here for us.”
Older monk (me): “The lesson is that some teachers are better than others … and perhaps ours made a mistake in choosing this one.”
Younger monk (stops polishing, opens mouth in disbelief): “I can't think that. I won't think that.” (Younger monk hastily leaves my presence.)
That was the day I realized that my incessant questioning had finally isolated me from the community.

This seemingly trivial exchange illustrates the defining paradox of Tibetan Buddhism: guru-devotion.
Here's how it goes: You should regard your guru as a fully enlightened buddha. To benefit from your relationship with him, you must see them as always having your interests at heart, no matter what. If you doubt, question or reject that, you're cut off from your source of spiritual advancement now and in future lifetimes, where you'll suffer countless rebirths in tantric hell.
Is your guru devotion a true
relationship, or just a dependency?
As a desperately hungry spiritual seeker thirty-five years ago I suspended my doubts without a second thought. I'd burned my bridges back home, almost lost myself in drugs, found a home among the Tibetans and done what was necessary to fit in.
As you'd expect, this prescription has its dangers. A recent Canadian documentary reports that the influential Tibetan lama Sogyal Rinpoche abused their female disciples for sex. As in earlier but less explosive exposés, those wishing to tell the story were confronted by a Vatican-like code of secrecy that has silenced even the Dalai Lama. In 1993 they chose to not endorse a letter calling on students to report abusive teachers.
A less public, more insidious, danger is the disciple's private decision to avoid seeing the guru's human failings. When the facts of life are incompatible with your spiritual practice, you're headed for bitter disillusion.
On first contact, Tibetan Buddhism is a welcoming paragon of reason and compassion. However, the teachings are layered with esoteric, mystical, exclusive and secret accretions. On the bottom lie the austere ethics and philosophy of the historical Buddha, referred to as ‘the lesser vehicle.' Above this is the ‘greater vehicle,' and then the ‘secret vehicle,' also called tantra. It's at this level that a guru is indispensible.
There's no historical record of the Buddha teaching tantra
Tantra is a rich body of symbolic practice with strict ethical codes. However, it employs sexual and demonic imagery that's easily manipulated, not only by opportunistic teachers but also by the wishful thinking of devotees. Tantric lore and even contemporary Tibetan history are rife with invisible demons and magical happenings.
Wishful thinking permeates Tibetan religious life. Lamas are routinely referred to as a living buddha, especially if they're wealthier, smarter or better-connected. Tibetan culture is deeply stratified. The Tibetan language itself has different vocabularies for speaking up to a superior, across to a peer or down to an inferior. The everyday name for woman is, ‘low-born.'
Although many devotees bury their doubts and questions, the tantric scriptures do not demand it. They wisely spell out the precariousness of the guru-disciple relationship and call on teachers and students to inspect one other for years before making this esoteric pact. In practice however, ‘secret' empowerments are freely available. The Dalai Lama's public Kalachakra rituals are organized and attended like rock concerts. Few devotees pass up the opportunity, and then they're supposed to view the officiating lama as a tantric guru.
Newcomers to Tibetan Buddhism are often hungry for enlightenment, and teachers need students for their ongoing credibility and sustenance. You might wonder, “What's a fully enlightened buddha like?” More to the point, is this a true relationship or just a dependency?
* * *
There's no historical record of the Buddha teaching tantra. To lend these practices authenticity the Tibetan establishment calls them the Buddha's ‘secret' teachings, carried out in a duplicate body in another realm of existence at the same time they were teaching here on Earth. The practice is further legitimized by the claim that tantra is built upon ‘ordinary' Buddhist practice. In theory, you can choose at what level you wish to practice. However, tantra is said to make enlightenment achievable in as little as three years, as opposed to the ‘countless lifetimes' of ordinary Buddhism. Once ensnared in the Tibetan orbit, few devotees opt out.
Is your view of the guru an example of heightened
perception, or the projection of an ideal?
For them, Tantra is supercharged Buddhism. They engage in the most elaborate mental gymnastics to maintain its compatibility with ordinary Buddhism. The inner culture is infused with hierarchical relationships that mirror Tibetan society. ‘Ordinary' Buddhism and tantric ritual are inseparably entwined.
Ordinary Buddhism depends on the basic practice of mindful attention. This form of mental training, used today worldwide by progressive physicians, requires practitioners to unsentimentally see things as they are. It takes a long-term approach to stress by delivering insight into the ways we think things ‘should' be. This can be disquieting. By contrast, tantric practitioners need to view every facet of the guru's behavior as enlightened. Whether or not it's actually possible to reconcile these two approaches, for all but the most penetrating thinkers they end up being mutually exclusive.
The question that most guru devotees avoid at all costs is the one that mindfulness poses most insistently: Is your view of the guru an example of heightened perception, or the projection of an ideal? When I could no longer isolate these two perspectives from each other, I lost my tantric faith and migrated to the lesser vehicle. It was a step up to reality at the cost of great hand-wringing, guilt and self-doubt.
Since my memoir The Novice was published, I've received dozens of emails from people confronting the same dilemma. This is the trajectory of many who came to Buddhism through the Tibetan archway. It's a welcoming, enticing and beautiful archway. For the spiritually exhausted, beat-up and destitute, it's hard to resist the promises of supercharged Buddhism. However, sooner or later we all have to consider how it's working for us.
Decision-making is an emotion
Tantra is not stuff and nonsense, but it's widely disseminated and practiced in the most superstitious way, quite out of step with its dignity. Its symbolic and narrative value is as powerful as any Greek mythology, but for most devotees that comparison is pure heresy. Even among those who quit, few dare to speak up. I've been accused of apostasy and of being a ‘false prophet.' Some of those who reported Sogyal Lakar's sexual abuses received death threats.
A prerequisite of ordinary Buddhist practice is to inspect your own motivations, and one of the Buddha's great insights is that feelings precede reason or, as neuropsychologists put it, decision-making is an emotion. To examine your motivations in that way, to question why you accept and why you reject, is to expose yourself most nakedly to the daring path they took.
I put little stock in the great answers to life, but I value the questions. A half-century of wrestling with belief systems has convinced me that the big one is, “Why do I believe?” There's a lifetime's insight in there. Nothing in the tantric scriptures contradicts this critical approach, but as long as you're in Buddhism for comfort, consolation and security, you won't be going there.

President Donald Trump said on Sunday that their criticism of NFL players who kneel during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice in the United States “has nothing to do with race.”
“We have great people representing our country, especially our soldiers, our first responders, and they should be treated with respect,” Trump said when asked about their comments by a group of reporters. “And when you get on your knee and you don't respect the America flag or the anthem, that's not being treated with respect.”
When a reporter asked asked the president if they are “inflaming racial tensions,” they replied: “This has nothing to do with race. I never said anything about race. This has nothing to do with race or anything else. This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag.”
These comments follow a feud that ignited over the weekend between Trump and the NFL. On Friday, Trump told a rally in Alabama, “Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say: ‘Get that son of a b— off the field right now, out. He's fired. He's fired!'”
In a rare statement addressing a political issue, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell called Trump's remarks “divisive,” and said they “demonstrate an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.”
Trump escalated their demands on Sunday morning by calling for fans to boycott the NFL. “You will see change take place fast,” Trump tweeted. “Fire or suspend!”
Throughout Sunday's football games, players knelt, locked arms, raised fists, sat on the bench, and stayed in the locker room in opposition to the president.

The Rajasthan Forest Department has admitted to having declared Ranthambhore's Tiger-24 a man-eater — and moving it to an enclosure in Udaipur — under public pressure, without following the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) laid down by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), information obtained by The Indian Express under the Right to Information (RTI) Act shows. (The Indian Express, January 4, 2016)

So, does acting under “public pressure” make the removal of T-24 wrong?
Not necessarily. There is bound to be public pressure to remove every tiger that has killed people. However, while accepting that it was not aware of the SOP issued in January 2013 by the NTCA, the Rajasthan Forest Department also claimed to have followed the advisory issued in December 2007 by the same authority. But the 2013 SOP is only a fine-tuned version of the 2007 advisory — and both list the same basic requirements.
And what are these basic requirements for removing a tiger?
Advertising
Examining the circumstances and nature of an attack to determine if it was accidental or deliberate, establishing the identities of the big cats involved in deliberate attacks to pinpoint a serial offender, and acting fast to capture or eliminate an animal after it has made two deliberate attacks.
How does one distinguish between an accidental and a deliberate attack?
Accidental attacks are mostly in defence. A tigress with cubs is typically high-strung. As are all big cats during a hard-earned meal. A surprised tiger is rarely a pleased tiger, just ask a grass-cutter who has chanced upon a sleeping beauty. There is also room for mistaken identity: someone bending down or on their haunches may look like a prey animal.
Unless it is a desperate tigress encumbered by cubs, a big cat rarely eats a person it kills accidentally. Anyway, the consumption of a human kill alone is not enough proof that a tiger is a man-eater.
[related-post]
On rare occasions, a tiger may deliberately seek out human prey, often by stalking. Given an opportunity, such a tiger consumes every human kill and drags the corpse away to secure the remains.
While most accidental attacks are meant to be non-lethal — a swipe of the paw, frequently — deliberate attacks are meant to kill, and usually involve precision canine punctures in the neck.
How is the attacker identified?
DNA analyses can be foolproof. But that requires all big cats to be pre-profiled for DNA so that tiger hair, saliva etc. collected from a human kill can be matched to find the culprit.
GPS locations can help if the attacker is radio-collared. Camera-traps set up overlooking a kill may catch the killer returning for a second meal. If nothing else, pugmarks at the spot may offer clues.
Of course, nothing beats spotting the attacker in action, particularly by professionals who can identify known individual tigers.
But what makes a tiger target people?
Nobody really knows. The inability to take down wild prey due to age or injury is the usual justification offered. But healthy tigers in their prime are also known to turn on human beings.
What about T-24?
The unusually bold T-24 killed four people starting July 2010. Its radio-collar signal gave it away in the first case, in which the victim's body was dragged 500 m and consumed partially.
In March 2012, a bloody trail of pugmarks led to a well-fed, resting T-24, some 700 m from a mostly-eaten human kill that had been dragged 100 m from the spot of the attack.
Seven months on, T-24 ambushed a forester and refused to budge until a noisy crowd made a charge with four Gypsies to recover the corpse.
In May 2015, it brought down a forest guard by the neck.
According to the NTCA's 2013 SOP, such an “aberrant tiger” must be caught and “sent to the nearest recognised zoo and NOT released in the wild”.
How is that conservation?
Conservation is about saving the species, not about the welfare of an individual animal. Letting T-24 continue in the wild could have led to more attacks, turning locals against the Forest Department and making every Ranthambhore tiger a potential target. Not to mention the growing insecurity of the forest guards who must patrol on foot to secure the reserve.
So, did Rajasthan make the right decision?
Both yes and no. With all boxes — stalking, attacking to kill, dragging, consuming, confirmation of identity as a serial offender — checked, T-24 had to be removed. If anything, the decision came too late.
The 2007 NTCA advisory reads: “It may be difficult to establish after the first case, but after the second case of human kill it can easily be decided if the animal has turned into a man-eater.” In fact, after the third lethal attack, the NTCA expressed serious concern and urged the state to take action in 2012.

But Rajasthan dithered, disregarding NTCA protocol and people's safety. Then, when another lethal attack affected the morale of the field staff last May and the state had to act, it failed to take the NTCA on board. And an otherwise watertight case became controversial.
USA Today
Twenty years ago, it would have been virtually impossible to imagine an American soccer player like Gyasi Zardes sprinting down the left side of a Dutch soccer field, outpacing defenders and making a difficult goal look like a simple tap-in to start the scoring for the United States men's national team in what would become a furious 4-3 comeback win against the Netherlands.
Zardes, simply put, is an athlete. With a perfect blend of speed, agility and determination, they are a menace when racing up and down the sideline. Their first touch is a revelation, blending spin moves and quick turns typically seen in the NBA Finals onto the grass soccer fields rapidly emerging across the country.
It's not that Zardes would have lacked the ability or work ethic. When they were growing up in Hawthorne, California, that was never in question.
"I always wanna work hard, and that's always been my motto," Zardes told Bleacher Report. "I'm from Hawthorne, and people from Hawthorne work hard."
That's not just their opinion. You might have heard of another hardworking young baller from Hawthorne by the name of Russell Westbrook. Back in 2011, Westbrook's dad shared this story of Russ' childhood drive with Darnell Mayberry of the Oklahoman: "He said, 'Dad, I know it's Thanksgiving. But I want to shoot. Let's go shoot.' I looked at my wife. I looked at Ray. I said, 'Let's go shoot.' And we put it in like it was a normal day."
You can probably imagine a young Westbrook putting their head down, manically charging up court for one of their coast-to-coast dunks. Add a blonde mohawk for a bit of flair, and you're not too far away from the presence Zardes brings to the field.
That kind of intensity, combined with gifted athleticism, usually leads to success one way or another; it's simply inconceivable that Zardes would have turned down football offers from Penn State, Oregon State and Boise State so they could work at Jamba Juice in order to afford playing soccer at Cal State Bakersfield.
But as Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia can attest, times have certainly changed. The USMNT is no longer a punchline. Instead, with a growing, athletic talent pool, young American soccer players are punching back.

Stop me if you've heard something like this before: "If the U.S. had guys like Allen Iverson playing soccer, we'd be the best in the world."
Janusz Michallik, a Polish-American soccer player who was a part of the early-'90s national teams that reinvigorated America's passion for the beautiful game and is covering the Gold Cup for Fox Sports, certainly does.
"In my days, sort of the mantra was that [the USMNT] didn't get the best athletes," Michallik told Bleacher Report.
Michallik doesn't necessarily think it's all that different today—after all, the Kyrie Irvings and Todd Gurleys of America still typically choose to play basketball and football—but the potential for that to change has never been more tangible.
When Michallik came over to the U.S., several soccer leagues had already folded, including the United Soccer Association, the North American Soccer League (which has since mounted a comeback), the United Soccer League, the Western Soccer Alliance and several others. By the time Michallik was ready to play professionally, the only option was an indoor league. The thought of a soccer-specific stadium was a fantasy.
"You could understand why someone would choose to play other sports because there was no league, no way to make a living," Michallik said.
Fast-forward to 2015, and the landscape is entirely different.
"The progress is incredible," Michallik said. "If you told me in 20 years that MLS was gonna have the kind of players like [Andrea] Pirlo and [Frank] Lampard, along with so many soccer-specific stadiums and some players were earning $5 million or $6 million per year, I don't think I would have believed that."
Though the success of MLS can be attributed to a number of different factors, none allowed the league to develop talent more than the homegrown player rule. Established in 2008, the rule allowed teams to sign players directly from their youth clubs instead of forcing them to go through the MLS draft, where any team could sign them.
Finally, teams had a financial incentive to invest in their youth teams to develop talent instead of waiting for it to come along.
Enter Gyasi Zardes.
After leading the Los Angeles Galaxy's U-20 side to a championship in 2010 while redshirting for their college squad, Zardes erupted with 23 goals in their last 39 games for Cal State. Their dominance took them to their first-ever NCAA Division I tournament appearance. Shortly after, in December 2012, the Galaxy signed Zardes as a homegrown player, and they scored their first goal in their third game.
Zardes hasn't looked back since.
They surveyed the scene in their first season before blowing up in Year 2, scoring 16 league goals. That total was sixth-best overall and set a new scoring record for homegrown players. In what was the biggest game of their career, Zardes became the first homegrown player to score a goal in the MLS Cup when they kept their balance amid a deflection and flying defenders to find the net, helping secure the Galaxy's third title in four seasons.
Entering 2015 with a target on their back, Zardes didn't shy away. They debuted for the national team against Chile when they came on for Clint Dempsey in the 68th minute of a 3-2 loss. Zardes was ready a few days later against Panama, earning their first start while wreaking havoc upon defenders throughout the game.
One brilliant run completely opened up Panama's defense, allowing Zardes to slide a beautiful pass to Dempsey, who promptly gave the U.S. an insurmountable two-goal lead.
Their impact was felt once again in two June friendlies against the Netherlands and Germany. Zardes' speed on the wing was a nightmare for the Dutch defenders, leaving players in their dust like a 2009 Chris Johnson. Their composed goal opened the scoring for the USMNT and afforded the team a glimmer of hope when it went down 3-1 early in the second half.
What proceeded was an onslaught rarely, if ever, seen from a U.S. soccer team, which channeled free-flowing aggression into a magnificent 4-3 comeback victory.
While the goal contributed toward the only stat line that really matters in soccer, their pace created space for midfielders like Michael Bradley and Mix Diskerud to find angles and pass the ball upfield. Opponents have to respect their speed, and you could see Dutch defenders tracking back to make sure they didn't get burned on counterattacks. It's a subtle difference that creates a world of opportunity.
It was clear five days later that the boys weren't satisfied with one magnificent win, as Zardes and company knocked off defending world champions Germany, 2-1, on their own turf.
With confidence from their national team performances, Zardes flexed all over the Philadelphia Union in one of their last MLS games before the Gold Cup began July 7. Toying with defenders, Zardes flashed up and down the wing, hit the post once, set up two goals and finished with a classic goal of their own by out-sprinting the entire Union defense despite a 20-yard head start.
The Galaxy went home with a 5-1 victory, and Zardes was named the MLS Player of the Week after they spent half the game with a defender trailing so far behind that you had to wonder if the entire defensive line had lame hamstrings.
Perhaps the most incredible aspect of Zardes' ascension is that he's not even playing their natural position. Preferring to play a central role, Zardes is often forced to play on the wing because of their sheer speed and athletic ability. Michallik says this will only improve their game.
"He's an athlete, he's physical, and I think he's grown technically, but he's still improving there," Michallik said. "But he's got all the attributes a soccer player needs, and they will become even better tactically by learning to play on both sides of the ball."
Mark Humphrey/Associated Press
Though their performances and blonde mohawk command the spotlight, Zardes isn't the only young American putting the world on notice. Lined up next to DeAndre Yedlin, Bobby Wood and Jordan Morris—not to mention stalwarts like Jozy Altidore and Bradley and European imports like Julian Green, Diskerud and Fabian Johnson—the young crop of athletic Americans signifies a new era for the USMNT.
"It's definitely a sign of youth soccer and how it's been beneficial for the American game and the MLS, so we kinda wanna be poster boys for the future of the game moving forward," said 18-year-old Galaxy teammate and fellow homegrown player Bradford Jamieson, who scored their first professional goal in their second start against the New York Red Bulls this season.
"There's a lot of momentum, and I think there are a lot of guys besides Gyasi and me that are young talents."
Even scarier for the rest of the world? Zardes is just getting started, according to their Galaxy and USMNT teammate, Omar Gonzalez.
"It's hard going up against them at practice because sometimes I'm tired, and they never lets up," Gonzalez, a central defender, told Bleacher Report. "He always wants to go more, always wants to get more reps shooting with the coaches, always wants to improve their game, and it's great to see in a young guy. …If they keep working like that, he's going to be great for years to come."
That work will continue at this year's Gold Cup, which is perhaps primed to be the most competitive that it's ever been, according to Michallik. It's typically seen as a tournament between Mexico and the USMNT; Costa Rica, Honduras and Jamaica will all throw up their hands in objection, given recent results—particularly following Costa Rica's spectacular run to the quarterfinals of the 2014 World Cup.
If it's any indication, both the USMNT and Mexico are taking jacked squads into the tourney. Despite the dazzling performances of the young guns in recent friendlies, USMNT coach Jurgen Klinsmann opted for a veteran-heavy lineup for the Gold Cup, though they inevitably found room for Zardes.
At this point, despite their youth, Zardes appears to be a mainstay on the USMNT. Like with Reggie Bush's first-year student year at USC, it would be irresponsible to leave such a talent off the field, despite the growing pains. A player like Zardes gets better every time they play the game, always increasing their technique, timing and first touch. They provide a consistent game-changing threat.
 They are the kind of player American soccer fans have been waiting for.

Pancakes are mandatory for any Sunday brunch; in fact, these vegan pancakes are so good they will top all the other dishes. It doesn't hurt that this vegan recipe is so easy to make either!
When I first started my plant-based diet I was surprised how easy it was to make pancakes without the eggs. No replacement needed, just remove them, and the pancakes taste the same, if not better. Why was it egged in them in the first place?
In Sweden, we call these types of pancakes “American Pancakes”. The Swedish ones are much larger, thinner and more crepes-like, but since I haven't lived in Sweden for some time I've become more internationalised in my pancake intake and only make the thinner ones when we do the classic Swedish dish “Yellow pea soup”, where the pancakes are served as a side dish or after the soup.
How to make vegan pancakes
Now, dont't worry, you won't have to make anything special here at all, just bring out all the ingredients and start out by mixing the flour, baking powder, salt and the optional cinnamon. Mix it so that you spread the baking powder evenly in among the other dry ingredients.
Then add the soy milk (or any other non-dairy milk), oil and syrup and mix everything until you have a lump-free batter. Let the batter rest while you heat up a greased skillet.
Add a ladle full of batter to the skillet and fry the pancakes until they start to bubble and dry up, then flip them over and fry until cooked through.
Keep in mind that the skillet will get hotter and hotter between frying batches so you might have to adjust the heat so that you don't burn the pancakes. If they start to stick and become hard to flip over, just add some more oil to the skillet before adding more batter.
That's it! I hope you will enjoy these vegan pancakes. You can serve them with some maple syrup, berries or why not this quick and easy blueberry raspberry jam?
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, said it has received information from overseas regulators about "possible misconduct" by UBS involving submissions for the city's interbank rate, known as Hibor , and other reference rates in Asia.
UBS was fined by Swiss, British and US regulators on Wednesday after an investigation revealed evidence of massive misconduct in the setting of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) , a global reference that affects trillions of dollars of loans and mortgages.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it had "commenced an investigation to assess whether the potential misconduct had any material impact on Hibor, which is considered a key benchmark interest rate for economies in the region.
It will work with overseas regulators to gather information and "consider further actions that need to be taken" pending the findings of the investigation.
Tom Alexander William Hayes, 33-year-old British former Tokyo-based trader, and Roger Darin, a Switzerland-based managing director responsible for the bank's Libor submissions, were both charged with conspiracy, the US Justice Department said.
They are the first to face criminal charges in the investigation into Libor manipulation by global regulators.
Mr Hayes was also charged with wire fraud and a "price-fixing violation arising from their collusive activity with another bank to manipulate Libor".
They were one of three men arrested last week by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with its own investigation into Libor-rigging.
Mr Hayes, was described by the US investigators as one of UBS's most successful yen derivatives traders and was said to have generated profits for the bank in the three years before they left in September 2009 of $236m. The size of their profits meant the banker could have earned anything up to $20m over the period based on the way banks pay their top traders.
UBS's fine is more than three times the £290m fine levied on Barclays in June for attempting to rig the Libor benchmark rate used to price financial contracts around the world.
It includes a £160m payment to the Financial Services Authority, the largest penalty ever levied by the British watchdog, $1.2bn paid to US authorities and a 59m Swiss franc 'disgorgement of profits' order from the Swiss.
As part of the settlement, UBS' Japanese arm has agreed to enter a plea to one count of wire fraud relating to the manipulation of certain benchmark interest rates, including yen Libor.
The steep fine for UBS is despite the bank, since 2011, co-operating with law-enforcement agencies in their probes. The bank said it received conditional immunity from some regulators.
In a statement on Wednesday, UBS said that certain personnel had "engaged in efforts to manipulate submissions for certain benchmark rates to benefit trading positions".
"Certain employees at the bank colluded with employees at other banks and cash brokers to influence certain benchmark rates to benefit their trading positions," UBS added.
The bank said that this conduct related to seven benchmark interest rates, although the nature and extent of the behaviour in question varied significantly from one currency to another.
UBS chief executive Sergio Ermotti said: “During the course of these investigations, we discovered behaviour of certain employees that is unacceptable. Their misconduct does not reflect the values of UBS nor the high ethical standards to which we hold every employee."
"We have co-operated fully with the authorities and taken decisive and appropriate actions to correct the issues and to strengthen our control processes and procedures," they added.
"We deeply regret this inappropriate and unethical behaviour. No amount of profit is more important than the reputation of this firm, and we are committed to doing business with integrity.”
The FSA said at least 45 people were involved in or were aware of the rigging and that the breaches occurred over a five-year period between January 2005 and December 2010.
The watchdog described the misconduct as "extensive and widespread", with at least 2,000 requests for inappropriate submissions documented and "unquantifiable" number of oral requests.
In its final notice to UBS, the FSA details some of the interactions, saying that "in the course of one campaign of manipulation", a UBS trader agreed with their counterpart that they would attempt to manipulate UBS' submissions in "small drops" in order to avoid arousing suspicion.
The FSA added that the "total disregard for proper standards by these traders and brokers" is clear from documented communications in which they referred to each other in "congratulatory and exhortatory terms" such as "the three muscateers [sic]", "superman" and "be a hero today".
In one example, the FSA quotes a UBS trader saying: “if you keep 6s [the six-month yen Libor rate] unchanged today ... I will [expletive] do one humongous deal with you ... Like a 50,000 buck deal, whatever ... I need you to keep it as low as possible ... if you do that ... I'll pay you, you know, 50,000 dollars, 100,000 dollars ... whatever you want ... I'm a man of my word.”
Its final notice also revealed that UBS made "corrupt payments" of £15,000 per quarter to brokers to reward them for helping the Swiss bank manipulate interest rates.
Tracey McDermott, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime, said: “The findings we have set out in our notice today do not make for pretty reading."
"The integrity of benchmarks such as Libor and Euribor are of fundamental importance to both UK and international financial markets. UBS traders and managers ignored this," they added.
"They manipulated UBS's submissions in order to benefit their own positions and to protect UBS's reputation, showing a total disregard for the millions of market participants around the world who were also affected by Libor and Euribor. "
The government's vision of making use of internet-enabled services straddling governance, commerce, education, healthcare and finance is laudable. However, to ride on IT, robust infrastructure is a must, namely, telecom connectivity (read: ubiquitous, high-speed broadband) and stable power supply.
Given that mobile phone will be a prime mode to move to a digital economy, the government must make available more and cheaper spectrum for mobile use. The need is to ensure that there is no disconnect between goal and policies. Government agencies must implicitly follow the procedures to make the transition to online services smooth for every citizen. Take the simple case of e-filing of a compliant of loss of a person's passport to the police. Often, servers crash, and hapless citizens are unable to file their complaint online, mandatory in a place like Delhi. The police blame technology, but lag in filing an FIR delays the process of applying for a duplicate passport.
This is unacceptable. Similarly, certificates issued by the government are to be stored in individual digital lockers and a communication protocol is to be established for government departments to access them. So, servers must work. Studies have reportedly shown there is potential for a reduction in the usability of government online services due to factors such as access to internet and usability of services. The need is to fix the glitches, not dispense with technology that brings in transparency and efficiency in public service delivery.
Often, implementation falters due to poor coordination between different government agencies. Digital India is not just about ambitious plans and technical wizardry. The citizen should not suffer because the infrastructure — physical or administrative — is not in place.
Cubs starters aim to throw 200 innings apiece every season, but last season's increased workload must be taken into consideration.
With four starters 30 or older, extra rest between starts becomes an obvious priority.
There's also the temptation to give other candidates a look, especially since three-fifths of the rotation could be gone after 2017.
And because of the industry-wide volatility of bullpen usage, depth is continually sought as early as spring training.
Welcome to the world of Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio, who has supervised the best staff in baseball despite early signs of rotation fatigue, bullpen ineffectiveness and injuries.
From extra rest for the starters in the final three months to the additions of Aroldis Chapman and Joe Smith to strong second halves from Justin Grimm and Carl Edwards Jr., the Cubs are well-aligned for the playoffs — no matter which team they face in the first round.
"That's where (manager) Joe Maddon and I talk about different things — different scenarios, matchups," Bosio said. "He has their information. They call it their matrix information, with probability stuff. We talk about rest and workload, especially the matchup stuff with certain guys or what we need to work on before this guy is ready for the next moment."
Bosio is grateful for the trust and communication that starts from the Cubs front office and runs through Maddon.
"Whether it's lining up the rotation or the bullpen, communication is … invaluable," Bosio said. "And the more we talk about things and work through things, the more prepared you're going to be going into a game or a series."
The Cubs didn't use a sixth starter until their 84th game, and that was designed primarily to give their five starters a break. They have employed left-hander Mike Montgomery, who could take over for Jason Hammel next season, as a sixth starter late in the second half.
The Cubs merely are taking measures to prevent fatigue, which cropped up during the playoffs last season, even if it means giving some starters as much as six days' rest.
"There's a lot to be said about staying on your routine, but there's a lot to be said about going into a postseason," Bosio said.
"Last year we had to play our ass off to get in. Nobody would ever try to change history with anything because we needed every win to get (there). But we learned a lot from last year."
The Cubs have given ace Jake Arrieta extra rest recently after their workload increased by 72 innings from 2014 to 2015, and Jon Lester and John Lackey have been pulled sooner than they have liked on occasion to limit their pitch counts.
"Joe has done a magnificent job of monitoring innings and pitch counts," Bosio said. "We're among the league leaders, not only for starters, but pitches thrown in our bullpen, so that has a lot to do with a winning record."
Bosio, 50, commands respect from their pitchers after pitching 11 seasons for the Brewers (1986-92) and Mariners (1993-96) despite ailing knees. They pitched a no-hitter in 1993.
"From talking with them and people who played with and against him, you learn a lot about their demeanor and competitiveness, their will to win," Arrieta said. "He's a guy who didn't put up with much. They were a tough guy back in the day. Still is.
"But that fire they had, they instill a lot of that in these guys here and has a lot of credibility because they did this in the same game we're playing and they did it for a long time.
"Any time you can have a mentor or instructor who has those credentials, it really helps guys to be able to latch on to them and use that information to the best of their ability."

We continue our tradition of pushing the limits of our local Burger King staff's kindness by ordering a double Whopper topped with around 80 bucks worth of pickles.
Sometimes, as a web-based writer, when a good news story doesn't come to you, you've just gotta go out and make one yourself. For us here at RocketNews24, more often than not, that means annoying the staff at our local Burger King by taking the chain's “Have it Your Way” slogan to ludicrous extremes. To date, we've ordered Whoppers with 1,000 slices of cheese, 100 slices of onions (gross), and 1,000 slices of bacon. 1,000 burger patties seemed a little extreme, even for us — and remember we're the people who bought US$10,000 worth of scratch lottery tickets basically for the lulz — so the next logical choice this time out seemed to be ordering the poor Burger King staff to top our burger with nearly a hundred bucks' worth of pickles.
What could possibly go wrong?
Once we determined which topping we'd go all out on this time, we very nearly sent over one of our Japanese writers straight away to order up the monstrous pickle burger in person. But, we had a last second change of heart, realizing the apocalyptic amount of pickles we were planning to order could very well put the store out of pickles for days to come, resulting in the other hungry masses being forced to consume bland, pickle-free Whoppers. Our consciences just wouldn't allow that, so we called to place the order in advance.
On the phone with the store's manager, we were told the retailer couldn't “vouch for the flavor” but assured us they possessed pickles in abundance and could fulfill the order if we really, really wanted it. Which, of course, we did, because anything worth doing is worth overdoing to a ridiculous and dangerous extreme.
A couple of hours later, we put aside thoughts of how we had almost certainly caused several teenage Burger King employees to hit the absolute nadir of their food service industry experience, and traipsed over to get a look at our prize. The resulting burger, topped with around 9,000 yen (US$75-80) in pickles, was hefty, to say the least — we'd later find it weighed a whopping (hahahahaha, sorry…) 1.7 kg. It was so huge and bulky that the hapless staff members charged with packing up the thing had to sort of just tape together a bunch of standard wrappers. And, since pickles are one of the more moist toppings on a burger, the over 700 slices of pickles adorning our burger had already soaked through all those wrappers, turning the whole package into a wet mess right out of the gates.
Obviously, the towering almost-entirely-pickles-Whopper was far too big to eat like a regular burger, so the whole sad, mutated mass had to be disassembled and eaten piecemeal by everyone in the office — so basically, one guy ended up just eating a regular Whopper and everyone else walked away with hundreds of pickles. Which begs the question, if we can't even eat these ridiculous concoctions of ours as they're intended, why even bother with all this?
Well, because, what are we going to do? Not order a Whopper containing almost a thousand pickles? Hahahahaha, now that would just be silly…

Lowering A City's Homeless Population — By Forcing The Homeless Out
Enlarge this image toggle caption Greg Allen
It's been a week of goodbyes at the Homeless Voice in Hollywood, Fla. For nearly 13 years, this rundown, 22-room hotel operated as a homeless shelter.
On most nights, hotel manager Christine Jordan says, more than 200 homeless men and women stayed here, some sleeping on mats in the cafeteria.
"We called this the emergency level ... almost 40 people in here every night," they say. Some stayed for free and others paid on a sliding scale. "[Now], everything's gone. I can't cry anymore."
It all came to an end last week, when the city of Hollywood closed a deal with the shelter's owner, Sean Cononie, a homeless advocate and entrepreneur. Hollywood bought Cononie's hotel and several other properties for $4.8 million. More than 100 of the shelter's residents boarded buses and headed to new quarters in Central Florida, 200-plus miles away. Some others made their way into the county shelter system.
For the city, this marked the end of a long and unhappy relationship with Cononie. A decade ago, Hollywood tried and failed to shut down their shelter, which was self-supporting. Their homeless clients paid rent by selling the Homeless Voice newspaper or by drawing on disability or other government benefits.
Now the South Florida beach community is in the midst of a building boom, with developers setting their sights on the shelter's aging neighborhood. Cononie decided to cash in and move their shelter and tenants out of the city, but he's not happy about it.
"This has been my home," they say. "Most people know that I sleep at the shelter. So it's been traumatic ... I sold the homeless out. I had no choice in the matter. They wouldn't let us expand here. We weren't getting the services we needed from the city."
Cononie, 50, says the deal they made with the city allows them to continue working with the homeless — anywhere but in Hollywood. That's because of an unusual provision that bans them from living in the city for the next 30 years. By the time that provision expires, he'll be 80.
"They were afraid if I owned a house that I would let a homeless person spend the night," they say. "And it would be a slippery slope for me to get away with opening up another shelter."
Hollywood is located in Broward County, which has had a contentious relationship with homeless residents and those who serve them. Neighboring Ft. Lauderdale has long tried to restrict feeding programs for the homeless.
But, says Hollywood spokesperson Raelin Storey, "This is not about the city of Hollywood not being open to providing assistance for individuals who are experiencing homelessness." They note that the city is home to a 125-bed, homeless shelter that is run by the county.
Like much of South Florida, Hollywood is seeing a building boom, with more than $1 billion of development in the works. Storey says that Cononie's homeless shelter presented an obstacle in an area targeted for redevelopment along one of the city's main commercial corridors. "The concentration along this particular corridor was creating a scenario where the city couldn't see the redevelopment potential," they say.
It's a similar story in other Florida coastal cities. Lorraine Wilby, with the Task Force Fore Ending Homelessness in Ft. Lauderdale, says that after building out the beachfront, developers are moving inland. "And where the development is happening," they say, "is some rundown, old, single-occupancy rooms and boarding houses and all those affordable or attainable places to live for people."
In recent years, Wilby says, their group, which served nearly 5,000 homeless clients in Broward County last year, has seen a marked increase in homelessness among the working poor — people with fulltime jobs who can't afford to pay first and last month's rent plus a security deposit.
As old neighborhoods give way to new development, Wilby warns that a lack of affordable housing will mean Hollywood's homeless problem is likely to persist long after Cononie and their shelter have moved on.
6:39pm: Not only are the Rockies getting strong interest in Gonzalez, reports Jon Morosi of FOX Sports (Twitter link), they're signaling to other clubs that they're willing to move Corey Dickerson and/or Charlie Blackmon in trades as well.
Blackmon and Dickerson would add a pair of younger, more controllable outfield options to the trade market. The 29-year-old Blackmon is arbitration eligible for the first time this winter and coming off a strong pair of seasons in which he's batted a combined .287/.341/.445 with 36 home runs and 71 stolen bases. He's not considered a great defender in center field and does have significant home/road splits in addition to platoon splits, but Blackmon is still a very useful commodity for clubs seeking a left-handed bat that could see some time in center field or in the outfield corners.
Dickerson, 26, comes with four years of club control but missed a good deal of the 2015 season due to plantar fasciitis and a broken rib. However, when healthy, the former top prospect has established themselves as a highly potent bat, slashing a combined .309/.354/.556 with 34 homers across their past 712 plate appearances in the Majors. Like Blackmon, the left-handed-hitting Dickerson does carry notable platoon splits and home/road splits over the life of their career. But, four years of a player with their offensive upside would certainly draw widespread interest, especially considering the high prices we've seen across the free-agent market thus far.
11:08am: With the outfield market beginning to heat up, the Rockies are receiving a “flurry” of hits on outfielder Carlos Gonzalez, Jerry Crasnick of ESPN.com reports on Twitter. Gonzalez is owed $37MM over the next two seasons before he'll qualify for free agency.
Gonzalez, who turned thirty in October, is particularly interesting because of the short (albeit not inexpensive) control rights they come with. Some teams looking at the free agent market for a power outfield bat may prefer to avoid the longer-term risk that would be required to sign a free agent.
Then, there's the fact that Gonzalez hits from the left side. That's also true of Jason Heyward and Alex Gordon, but CarGo is a closer match in terms of power and age to Justin Upton and Yoenis Cespedes, both of whom are righties. Gonzalez has had injury issues of late and has struggled at times, but restored their value with a big second half.
The US government will not stop Native American tribes from growing marijuana on tribal lands, nor will it enforce federal pot laws on the groups, according to a recently released Department of Justice memo.

“With a number of states legalizing marijuana for use and production, some tribes have requested guidance on the enforcement of the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) on tribal lands by the United States Attorneys' offices,”the memo begins.
The directive outlines eight federal law enforcement priorities wherein the DOJ “will focus its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources in all states.”
Federal attorneys should target keeping pot away from minors; thwarting criminal enterprises like gangs and drug cartels from profiting off marijuana sales; preventing the transportation of cannabis out of states where it has been legalized; barring legal marijuana activity from acting as a cover for illegal actions, as well as the use of firearms during those legitimate activities; targeting drugged driving and other adverse public health consequences; preventing marijuana from being cultivated on public lands and federal property, even in states where the crop is legal.
Regarding Native American lands, the memo says the Justice Department “requires consultation with our tribal partners in the districts and flexibility to confront the particular, yet sometimes divergent, public safety issues that can exist on any single reservation.”

The directive, entitled the 'Cole Memorandum,' says that federal prosecutors should consult with each tribe “on a government-to-government” basis when evaluating marijuana enforcement activities on native lands. The guidance will be implemented on a case-by-case basis and tribes must still follow federal guidelines, Timothy Purdon, the US attorney for North Dakota and the chairperson of the Attorney General's Subcommittee on Native American Issues, told the Los Angeles Times.
But just because the tribes could turn marijuana cultivation into a cash cow ‒ like many have done with casinos ‒ doesn't mean they will. Native American reservations have high rates of alcoholism, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listing alcohol use as an important health issue that disproportionately affects some Native subgroups. The CDC also lists chronic liver disease and cirrhosis as the fifth leading cause of death.
A 2011 survey published in JAMA Psychiatry found that 15 percent of Native American adolescents aged 12 to 17 suffer from a drug abuse disorder, compared to 7.9 percent of the entire adolescent population.
"Native Americans and their families suffer disproportionately from addiction compared to other groups," Kevin Sabet, head of the anti-legalization project Smart Approaches to Marijuana, told the LA Times. "The last thing they want is another commercialized industry that targets them for greater use."
They called the policy an "extremely troubling development" that “once again sends a message that we really don't care about federal drug laws."
The federal government will continue to legally support those tribes that wish to ban marijuana, even in states that now permit its sale, while remaining on the sidelines for those federally recognized tribes that choose to allow it, Purdon said.
"The tribes have the sovereign right to set the code on their reservations," they noted.
“Having the Department of Justice take a stance honoring the sovereignty of Native American tribes when it comes to how they set their own marijuana policy is refreshing,” NORML Communications Director Erik Altieri told Marijuana.com in an email. “The individuals living on these reservations deserve the same freedom to decide how they chose to handle marijuana on their own lands as we are currently providing the fifty states under current Justice Department memos.”

Mason Tvert, a spokesperson for the pro-legalization Marijuana Policy Project, said that tribal leaders “will have a tremendous opportunity to improve public health and safety, as well as benefit economically” by legalizing marijuana.
“Regulating and taxing marijuana like alcohol would ensure the product is controlled, and it would bring significant revenue and new jobs to these communities,” they told US News & World Report.
“Studies have consistently found above-average rates of alcohol abuse and related problems among Native American communities, so it would be incredibly beneficial to provide adults with a safer recreational alternative," they added.
There are 326 federally recognized Native American reservations, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
The memo, which was published Thursday but dated October 28, comes as Congress “appears poised to send a bill to President Obama that would ban the Department of Justice from meddling with state medical marijuana laws,” VICE reported. At the same time, however, the Republican-led US House is using a crucial spending bill in an effort to block the legalization of recreational marijuana in Washington, DC, where a ballot initiative passed last month with nearly 70 percent voter approval.
We all come into this world with sealed orders, said 19th century philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. Although the great Dane lived at a time when much of science was still gauzy and life events were often ascribed to fate, the notion seems to hold true today. A quick scan of newborn babies snoozing in a maternity ward offers little hint of what their futures hold.
But medical researchers are now unsealing these orders by seizing on a simple clue — a newborn's weight. Having established that being too small at birth carries health risks down the road, researchers are also finding that high birthweight comes with baggage.
A stream of evidence has upended the long-held assumption that a big baby is a healthy baby. Newborns pushing 9 pounds face an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and even neurological problems over a lifetime. They are more likely to run afoul of these conditions than are babies born in the “sweet spot
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Case Western Reserve University's $1 billion fundraising campaign was so successful it reached the goal 2.5 years early.
So it decided to increase the goal to $1.5 billion, officials said Sunday night.
President Barbara R. Snyder announced the "Forward Thinking" campaign's 50 percent expansion during the dedication of the $50 million Tinkham Veale University Center, which was funded entirely by donations. Also announced were several new gifts, including a $1 million pledge from Snyder and their husband Michael for undergraduate scholarships.
The five-year campaign had its public kickoff in the fall of 2011, when the university announced its goal and more than $600 million in commitments.
On Sunday, Snyder said the campaign total stands at $1.04 billion, including gifts and pledges from more than 47,000 individuals. For the fiscal year that ended June 30, alumni and friends committed a total of $151.6 million — $5.7 million more than the previous all-time record set in 2013.
The goals of the $1 billion fundraising drive were to increase financial support for students; grow the number of endowed professorships; and support significant capital projects.
Two priority projects are The Milton and Tamar Maltz Performing Arts Center at The Temple – Tifereth Israel and think[box], a 50,000-square-foot invention and innovation space to be located in the renovated Lincoln Storage building on the southwest part of campus.
"As humbled as we are by the generosity of our alumni and friends, we also are inspired by what their support allows us to achieve in education and research," Snyder said Sunday, according to a university news release. "We are continuing this effort so that we can extend this university's positive impact on individuals, communities and society at large."
The expanded campaign features the same three priorities.
On Sunday, two gifts were announced -- $4 million from Char Fowler and Roe Green to name the studio theater at The Milton and Tamar Maltz Performing Arts Center, and $1 million to think[box] — on top of a previous $1 million pledge for the same purpose — from 1967 biomedical engineering graduate Barry Romich.
The university has not set a new end date for the expanded campaign.

PORTLAND, Ore. – Portland Thorns FC goalkeeper Michelle Betos was voted the 2015 National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) Goalkeeper of the Year, it was announced today.
After appearing in 10 matches in their first two seasons in the league, Betos, 27, posted career-best numbers in games played (14), minutes played (1,260), saves (45), wins (5) and shutouts (2) in their second season with Thorns FC. Among NWSL goalkeepers, Betos ranked in the top three in games played and minutes played, conceding multiple goals in a match just four times all season.
Betos came up with key plays throughout the 2015 season to help Portland secure points late in matches. Notably, Betos became the first goalkeeper in league history to score a goal, which earned them NWSL Player of the Week honors for Week 10. Playing with 10 players and trailing 1-0 against FC Kansas City on June 19 at Providence Park, Betos converted a diving header in the final seconds of second-half stoppage time to secure a point for Portland. The goal was featured as the No. 2 play on ESPN SportsCenter's Top 10 plays the same night.
The 2015 Thorns FC Supporters' Player of the Year, Betos registered second-half stoppage time saves against Sky Blue FC on July 3 in a 2-1 win and denied forward Christen Press late to secure a 2-1 win against the Chicago Red Stars on Aug. 9. Betos also saved a second-half penalty kick, helping Thorns FC keep a clean sheet in a scoreless draw against the Houston Dash on June 6.
Betos began their NWSL career with Seattle Reign FC in 2013, starting in seven matches for the club. The New York native has competed in UEFA Women's Champions League with Cyprus club Apollon Limassol (2012-13, 2013-14) and most recently with Danish club Fortuna Hjørring, helping guide the club to the Round of 16 during the 2014-15 version of the tournament.
The NWSL awards are voted on by a selection of journalists that cover the league on a consistent basis, club officials, players and fans.
In an interview with The Australian Financial Review last year, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella revealed that the company would not make a comeback into the smartphone market just to compete with iPhone maker Apple and electronics giant Samsung. According to Nadella, Msoft's focus was on other products, in particular, cloud computing; its line of Surface computers; the Xbox Box One console; and HoloLens, their mixed reality headset. And in fact, the company appeared to be on the right path, as revealed by the impressive sales of their products, the increase in their market share and the subsequent rise in the value of their stock price.
In Mr. Nadella's view, Microsoft owed its success to the practice of focusing on aspects that they believe they can do differently compared with rival tech firms, and the culture of not being afraid to fail.
They said: “The key in any momentum we have is that you have to have some amount of boldness in taking risk, and knowing that you are not always going to get it right.”
Nadella cited the Surface as an example, pinpointing the fact that when it was released 3 years ago, people questioned the need for having a gadget in a two-in-one form. Years later, even their fiercest competitors have admitted that it was an idea worth pursuing.
In spite of Nadella's previous revelations, rumors that Microsoft was working on a new line of phones still persisted. Especially after Nadella said that they would ‘continue to be in the phone market'. More importantly, they were quoted as saying that Microsoft was not going to be ‘defined by today's market leaders'. Rather, the company would focus on the needs of a ‘specific set of customers', doing what only they can do, on what will be the ‘most ultimate mobile device'. It sure sounds like a promise of things to come, doesn't it?
More recently, in an interview for Marketplace's make me smart, Nadella hinted that Microsoft was looking into making phones that won't look anything like the traditional phones we have today.
“[W]hen you say we'll make more phones, I'm sure we'll make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today,” Nadella said while refusing to provide more specifics about the upcoming surprise. This strategy is a bit reminiscent of what Microsoft did with their Surface 2-in-1 laptops — a major reinvention in the making!
Nadella also said that they have selected specific areas of focus, specifically, management; security; and Continuum — supposedly a ‘phone that can even be a desktop'.
This supports what Microsoft's CMO Chris Capossella said in another podcast interview, where they discussed something about a Windows 10-based ‘breakthrough' Surface branded phone. Just the use of the word ‘breakthrough' is enough of a hint. It's just something you don't use lightly.
Like the Surface Laptop that we recently got introduced to which we're sure many people (even the non-Microsoft fans) can't help but be amazed at (at least as a first impression), we're really hoping the software giant makes good on its word. Hopefully, when their new phone comes out, the wait will be well worth it.
Chick-fil-A has ended its 22-year relationship with The Richards Group in a major shakeup at the chicken chain that includes moving its campaign to McCann New York and hiring a roster of agencies for other marketing that will not use its ubiquitious cows.
The changes come a year and a half after longtime Chick-fil-A executive Jon Bridges became the fast-feeder's chief marketing officer. They have been working on a "Cows-plus" marketing strategy, proposing the chain keep using the cows in some marketing while branching out beyond the bovines to tell stories on topics such as food, people and service that might not fit as well into the cow theme.
"The cows are an integral part of the brand. They're our mascot, if you will. But they aren't the brand. The brand is bigger than that," Mr. Bridges said in an interview.

Chick-fil-A's new approach after decades of cows-centric campaigns means The Richards Group is losing a client the agency has had since 1994. The agency introduced the Chick-fil-A cows appearing to paint their famous "Eat Mor Chikin" line on a billboard in 1995. The campaign has helped catapult Chick-fil-A to its perch as the top chicken chain in the U.S., with more than $6 billion in annual systemwide sales.
Mr. Bridges and Joe Saracino, who joined Chick-fil-A this year as VP-brand strategy and media, each commended the work that The Richards Group has done for the chain. The award-winning marketing is best known for its creative use of outdoor advertising featuring 3-D images and messages seemingly written by cows themselves.
"They were such an incredible partner for so long," Mr. Saracino said of The Richards Group.

The advertising helped Chick-fil-A, once a small, regional chicken player focused on mall locations, expand and become the country's 8th-largest U.S. restaurant chain.
"It's not very often that a campaign this successful results in an agency being fired. I don't know that there's much precedence for it," Stan Richards, principal and founder, The Richards Group, said in an interview. "It is a little hard to understand, and in many ways it's the saddest occurrence in my long, professional life."
Instead of having The Richards Group as its main agency for both marketing and media, Chick-fil-A's work will be handled by a roster of shops. McCann New York won the bulk of the business, including cows advertising. Starcom is Chick-fil-A's new media agency. Erich & Kallman, a small, new agency, came up with the first non-cow campaign. DesignStudio was brought on to help with overall brand visual identity and design. Moxie, which has worked on areas such as social media for Chick-fil-A, is also part of the roster as the chain moves forward with "Cows-plus" marketing.
End of a long relationship
Mr. Richards fondly recalled when Chick-fil-A's David Salyers came to the agency's office in 1994, unannounced, to let the team know it won the account.

"He then said, 'I want you to know we will never be your biggest client, but we will do everything we can to be your best client.' And for 20 years, they were. There was no question about that," Mr. Richards said.
Along with the billboards, the cows have appeared in everything from TV commercials to the annual calendars sold by Chick-fil-A and as toys in its kids' meals. The cows even have more than 34,000 followers on Twitter and their own section on the company's website.
"It's been an incredible ride for 20 years," Mr. Richards said. "There are not very many circumstances where you get to do what is recognized as brilliant work and do it consistently for 20 years and never falter. There's not a single piece of work that we put out for Chick-fil-A over those 20 years that I'm sorry we did, that I didn't think was up to our standards. So that hurts when that kind of relationship goes away."
About 30 of The Richards Group's 734 employees work on Chick-fil-A. "It's sad, but it's not catastrophic," Mr. Richards said of losing the account, adding that it is too early to say whether their agency would eliminate any positions as a result of losing the business. "I haven't looked at how much income is going away and how we'll absorb that or how we'll deal with it."

Meanwhile, McCann New York is preparing to work on the cows business and serve as Chick-fil-A's lead agency on brand strategy. Sean Bryan and Tom Murphy, co-chief creative officers at the shop, will oversee all creative.
"This is a great opportunity to work on a beloved and hugely successful brand, and we look forward to bringing fresh thinking and creativity to the business and brand," Chris Macdonald, president, McCann North America, said in a statement.
When asked whether McCann would keep the "Eat Mor Chickin" tagline, they responded that the agency has a "mission to bring that line to life." The agency's first work on Chick-fil-A should begin running sometime early next year, after a handover from The Richards Group. Asked whether anyone from The Richards Group who has worked on Chick-fil-A might move to McCann, Mr. Macdonald said it is "working on building the best possible team."

Chicken for breakfast
Chick-fil-A's sales have increased for 48 consecutive years since the chain began in 1967. The chain keeps growing at a rapid pace despite its decision to remain closed on Sundays for spiritual reasons. Annual systemwide sales topped $1 billion in 2000 and surpassed $6 billion in 2015.
The company is now well ahead of its nearest chicken-focused rival, even with fewer than half the number of locations. Chick-fil-A's systemwide sales jumped 8.8% to $6.29 billion last year, while KFC's U.S. systemwide sales rose 1.8% to $4 billion, according to Technomic. Atlanta-based Chick-fil-A exceeded 2,000 locations earlier this year. KFC had 4,270 locations in 2015, according to Technomic.
Despite its billions of dollars in systemwide sales, and sales per restaurant that exceed those at industry leader McDonald's, Chick-fil-A's marketing budget is modest. The company declined to share marketing spending. According to Kantar Media, Chick-fil-A spent $73.1 million on measured media in 2015, up sharply from $48.4 million in 2014.
"Having the opportunity to partner with Chick-fil-A is truly exciting for Starcom," Kathy Ring, CEO of Starcom USA, said in a statement. "Chick-fil-A is a great brand, and we're looking forward to helping them amplify their message by connecting and building relationships with new and existing customers through our expertise in data and technology."
Under Mr. Bridges, Chick-fil-A has held two jump balls to find creative work that does not feature the cows. The Richards Group participated in each of the sessions, one in 2015 centered on the chain's people, and one in 2016 for a new breakfast campaign. It did not win either project.
Erich & Kallman won the chance to work on the breakfast campaign, which marks the first major TV campaign for the newly-formed agency. Commercials, social videos and other marketing begin airing July 30 and make no references to the cows. Instead, they showcase six historical figures who had what were considered crazy ideas and now have the idea of eating chicken for breakfast. The theme is "Chicken for Breakfast. It's not as crazy as you think."

Free sanitary products could be available to all girls in secondary schools in Rhondda Cynon Taff if the council passes a new motion later this month.
Plaid Cymru are tabling the proposal, set to go before councillors on July 19, which would offer free tampons and towels to all 7,678 girls in the borough – acknowledging sanitary products are “as essential as toilet paper for the personal hygiene of female pupils”.
The motion, brought by new councillor Elyn Stephens, was always something they wanted to try and change in their area after being elected earlier this year.
The 25-year-old said: “I knew from the start it was something I wanted to do something about.
“I've been involved in youth politics for a while before I got elected and it's something that comes up quite often there but it's more along the lines of gender equality and basic healthcare. But I noticed in the wider area it doesn't really come up at all.
“In today's culture where people have less disposable income it's becoming more prevalent and I think the stigma surrounding menstrual hygiene has silenced the debate so it's harder to address the subject because no-one is talking about it.
“So if you've got some of the poorer families having a choice between buying food or getting sanitary products sometimes, surely that can't be right. The taboo of speaking about it has changed our way of thinking.
“To me, naturally, if you've got loo roll somewhere then you should have sanitary products.
“I think that if someone tried to take away funding for loo roll there would be uproar about it.
“But then again the subject of sanitary products hasn't been broached for some reason.”
And Elyn said it was more than just offering sanitary products – it was preventing some girls from getting the education they deserve.
They said: “So many girls are missing schools because of this and it's not just having a detrimental effect on their schooling but also on their health and wellbeing.
“There are fines if you miss more than 10 sessions in a term. Well, girls are missing more than this and it's being dismissed as they were ill.
“That isn't the case. They were just having a normal bodily function.”
'It would be a trailblazer'
The new initiative would cost RCT council around £70,000 a year – but Plaid Cymru group leader Pauline Jarman thinks it's “a small price to pay”.
They said: “We see it as being a very necessary provision in this day and age.
“Some people do miss school because of the affordability of tampons and towels.
“And 72% of the resident population of RCT live in the most deprived half of Wales so there is an impact on the social wellbeing of young residents as well.
“Reforms and austerity measures have had a severe impact on household incomes. For example in Maerdy people are estimated to have an average loss of £1,000 per adult per year because of benefit changes. So there are real pressures on household budgets.
“And 55% of people in poverty are working families.
“We're hoping we'll get unanimous support cross-party for this motion. It would be a trailblazer.
“It's about time we acknowledge that there are people who need this sanitary wear because there's it's a natural bodily function – it's 50% of the community.”
Scottish Government's pilot scheme
The vote comes as the Scottish Government announced a pilot scheme that will see 1,000 women and girls from low-income families in Aberdeen given free sanitary products to try and tackle “period poverty”.
The six-month run, launched by equalities secretary Angela Constance earlier this week, will see social enterprise company Commuity Food Initiatives North East (CFINE) hand out towels and tampons with the £42,500 needed to back the scheme funded by the Scottish Government.
poll loading Should free sanitary products be given to schoolgirls in Wales? 500+ VOTES SO FAR Yes No
The initiative will eventually see the feminine hygiene products distributed to a local college, three local secondary schools and other charitable organisations and, if continued, would be would make Scotland the first country in the world to provide free sanitary products to women and girls.
Sadly, the 18 month investigation into the IRS targeting of conservative groups isn't over, and it may be worse than anyone thought. A federal judge has broken loose more emails that the DOJ had surely hoped would never surface. The picture it reveals isn't pretty. The documents prove that Lois Lerner met with DOJ's Election Crimes Division a month before the 2010 elections.
It has to be embarrassing to the DOJ, which may not be the most impartial one to be investigating the IRS. In fact, the DOJ withheld over 800 pages of Lerner documents citing "taxpayer privacy" and "deliberative privilege." Yet these internal DOJ documents show Ms. Lerner was talking to DOJ officials about prosecuting tax-exempt entities (yes, criminally!) two years before the IRS conceded there was inappropriate targeting.
Ms. Lerner met with top officials from the DOJ's Election Crimes Branch in October of 2010. Although Judicial Watch filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit against the DOJ (Judicial Watch v. Department of Justice, No. 14-cv-01239), the DOJ coughed up dirt only on court order. Even then, the DOJ handed over only two pages of heavily redacted emails.
What's more, the DOJ withheld 832 pages in their entirety. They revealed that Mr. Obama's DOJ called an October 8, 2010 meeting with the IRS “concerning 501(c)(4) issues.” On September 30, 2010, the DOJ's Election Crimes prosecutor emailed Ms. Lerner:
"Hi Lois-It's been a long time, and you might not remember me, I've taken on [REDACTED] duties. I'm looking forward to meeting you, Can we chat in advance? I'm a [REDACTED]”
Ms. Lerner responded on October 2, 2010:
"Sure-that's a good Idea [sic]. I have a meeting out of the office Monday morning, but will try you when I get back sometime early afternoon. You can try me at 202 283-8848."
Documents from Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the IRS show that Ms. Lerner asked the DOJ whether tax-exempt entities could be criminally prosecuted. This May 8, 2013 email by Ms. Lerner went to Nikole C. Flax, Chief of Staff to Acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller, who would later be fired by President Obama:
"I got a call today from Richard Pilger Director Elections Crimes Branch at DOJ … They wanted to know who at IRS the DOJ folk s [sic] could talk to about Sen. Whitehouse idea at the hearing that DOJ could piece together false statement cases about applicants who “lied” on their 1024s–saying they weren't planning on doing political activity, and then turning around and making large visible political expenditures. DOJ is feeling like it needs to respond, but want to talk to the right folks at IRS to see whether there are impediments from our side and what, if any damage this might do to IRS programs. I told them that sounded like we might need several folks from IRS…"
DOJ's Mr. Pilger admitted that DOJ officials met Ms. Lerner in October 2010. Moreover, according to congressional investigators, a Lerner email from October 5, 2010 shows the IRS sent the FBI and DOJ a “1.1 million-page database of information from 501(c)(4) tax exempt organizations” that contained confidential taxpayer information.
In their May 2013 answer to a planted question about the alleged targeting of Tea Party and conservative groups, Ms. Lerner suggested that the alleged targeting occurred due to an “uptick” in 501 (c)(4) applications to the IRS. In reality, there was a decrease, and as for targeting (what targeting?), well, you know the rest.
Remember those rogue IRS employees in Cincinnati? They were confused. And while all Americans should be concerned, Judicial Watch sounds fit to be tied.
“No wonder the Department of Justice under Eric Holder has done no serious investigation of the Obama IRS scandal,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “These new documents dramatically show how the Justice Department is up to its neck in the IRS scandal and can't be trusted to investigate crimes associated with the IRS abuses that targeted Obama's critics,” they said. “Richard Nixon was impeached for less.”
Perhaps the latter is an overstatement. Yet it is getting harder and harder to simply accept President Obama's ‘no smidgen of corruption' remark made to Fox News in February, no matter how sincere and forthright their delivery.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah angrily demanded on Thursday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put on trial an embassy security guard who shot dead two Jordanians, and said relations between the neighbouring states were at risk.

Netanyahu gave the guard a hero's embrace after Israel brought them home under diplomatic immunity, behaviour that the king said was “provocative on all fronts and enrages us, destabilises security and fuels extremism”.
“We demand that the Israeli Prime Minister abides by their commitment and takes all measures to ensure the trial of the killer, and not handle this like a political show to achieve personal political gains,” they said.
The guard shot dead Jordanian teenager Mohammad Jawawdah at Israel's embassy in Amman on Sunday as well as the landlord of the house in the compound where the guard lived.
Israel said the guard had been defending themselves after Jawawdah attacked them with a screwdriver in a “terrorist attack”.
But Jordanian police, who were unable to question the guard, said on Monday that they had fired on the 16-year-old after the young man, who worked for a furniture company and was delivering an order, got into a brawl and attacked him. It was not clear how the landlord came to be shot.
Abdullah, who visited the family of the young teen and paid their condolences on Thursday, said the state would “do everything within its means” to get justice for the two men.
Jordan is one of two Arab states with which Israel has peace treaties, and such an outburst against Israel is rare.
Abdullah also cited a previous incident that outraged Jordanians, in which a Jordanian judge was shot in March 2014 by an Israeli soldier at a border crossing. No investigation was ever conducted.
“The way Israel handles the embassy case and the judge's killing and other cases will have a direct impact on the nature of our relationship,” Abdullah said.
Many Jordanians have accused the authorities of abdicating sovereignty by letting the guard leave, and lawmakers walked out of parliament in protest.
Jordan's public prosecutor was quoted on state news agency Petra as saying the Israeli security guard was charged under local penal laws with one count of murder and illegal possession of a firearm.
Diplomatic immunity did not mean the “killer” could not be put on trial in their own country, the Jordanian prosecutor said.
An Israeli judicial source who declined to be named said state prosecutors were giving “preliminary consideration” to an investigation. Asked if this could potentially lead to criminal charges, the source said: “Theoretically, any outcome is certainly possible.”
An Israeli government source, who also declined to be named, said Israel was also “giving preliminary consideration to offering compensation to the family of the second Jordanian killed in the incident”, meaning the landlord.
In a kingdom where many of its citizens are of Palestinian origin, anti-Israeli sentiment has been fuelled by a public perception created over the years that the authorities do not stand up to Israel over treatment of its citizens.

The outpouring of anger against Israel has also been fuelled in recent weeks by the furor over security devices that Israel installed at the Aqsa Mosque, of which Jordan is custodian. Israel has since removed the devices, including metal detectors and CCTV cameras.
Amman is sensitive to any changes at the site, which Israel captured from Jordan along with other East Jerusalem and West Bank areas in the 1967 war.
Protesters called for a rally on Friday to demand the government close the Israeli Embassy in Amman and scrap the unpopular peace treaty. The embassy has long been a flashpoint of anti-Israel protests at times of turmoil in the Palestinian territories.
A patient pup was finally reunited with their owner who was hospitalized for more than a week in Brazil.
According to local reports, the dog waited outside the hospital in Passo Fundo for eight days while their owner, Lauri da Costa, was undergoing an operation. In a heartwarming video, filmed by animal rights group ComPaTA, Seco jumps on the Brazilian man after the two are reunited in the hospital's courtyard.
Costa, a homeless man who lives with their dog in the Rio Grande do Sul city, arrived at the hospital on March 31 after they were hit in the face. Though initially treated for the injury, doctors reportedly discovered the man had melanoma and required surgery.
As Costa underwent skin cancer treatment, their faithful pet waited outside in the parking lot, since hospital rules do not permit animals to enter. Hospital staff provided food and water for the dog over the course of the week, Extra reports.
After eight days, when Costa was finally allowed to receive visitors, hospital workers arranged for the man to reunite with Seco in the facility's courtyard.
The stirring story is reminiscent of another report last year in which a dog was found waiting outside a hospital emergency room in Idaho after their owner was transported there by ambulance.

If you live in, around, or within driving distance of Cardiff, or possibly even within flying distance if you're up for an adventure, you might be interested to know that a month-long pop-up arcade gaming residency will occur in the city throughout August.
The event (which annoyingly doesn't appear to have a proper name, so I'm just going to have to keep referring to it as 'the event') is being organised by The Arcade Vaults, and will run from August 3rd to 31st at the Castle Arcade shopping centre in Cardiff.
According to event organisers, the pop-up arcade will cover both floors of 10-14 Castle Arcade, and will feature a large collection of playable retro consoles and computers. I'm told that the plan is to account for as many decades of gaming as possible; at the very least, you should find a Pong clone (specifically a Prinztronic Tournament II Deluxe, I'm told), an Atari 2600, NES, SNES, Megadrive, Commodore 64, Amiga, BBC Micro, Spectrum ZX2, N64, Gamecube, and PS1. And there should be a few modern consoles, PCs and tablets too.
As for the games, The Arcade Vaults (which specialises in retro gaming events around the city) will be rotating titles daily from across its large collection. You can expect the likes of Pac-Man, Asteroids, Street Fighter II, Micro Machines, various Mario Karts, Sensible Soccer, GoldenEye, and more—with the less kid-friendly games being kept for later in the day, should you wish to bring family/borrowed children along.
Additionally, a month-long schedule of tournaments, talks, and events is planned. Currently in the works are a "Mario Kart for the ages" tournament, covering multiple version of the game, general fighting tournaments, a Super Mario All-Stars speed-run world record attempt, and something to mark GoldenEye's 20th anniversary (yipe) on the weekend of the 24th/25th. This may involve cos-play. At present, the plan is to hold tournaments every Sunday, although it sounds like final event details will be confirmed within the next few days. I'd suggest keeping an eye on The Arcade Vaults' Facebook page for further details.
That's not the end of it though. Throughout August (likely on the Mondays, I'm told), there will be opportunities for local developers to show off their work-in-progress games, and speak to the public—all in conjunction with Games Wales, the government-backed representative body for games developers in Wales. Currently confirmed developers include Duel Fuel, Thud Media, National Insecurities, Blind Sky Studios, Dark Planet Studios, Filthy Fresh Studio, Mochi Games, Dojo Arcade, and Talespinners.
Wrapping things up on the 'stuff that is happening' front, there will hopefully be grouped Minecraft play sessions for kids every Wednesday, and some board game action hosted by local store Rules of Play. There'll also be local-artist-created video-game-themed art and merchandise to buy, and a late license every Thursday so that you may ply yourself (in moderation) with delicious craft beers and the like.
Tickets for the pop-up arcade portion of the event will cost £5 for adults and £3 for concessions. For that, you'll be able to hang around and play for as long as you want over the course of a day. Evening event pricing will be announced shortly on The Arcade Vaults' website and social channels.
The Linen Stitch on a Knitting Loom
I have a new obsession this week and its called the Linen Stitch. It has a very upscale and classy look. To top things off it is VERY easy to do. Below is a picture, text and video tutorial to help you with a pattern that only requires two steps.
This chance encounter began as I was looking for new stitches for my 50 New Stitches by 2016 Challenge that I plan to start soon. If you don't know anything about me – know this – I am a stitch hog. In my quest I bumped into this beauty and fell in love. I especially like the fact that it works for both men and women's wear. Some stitches are just not that versatile. It also has a nice texture that would work well on a dishcloth or wash cloth. Below the stitch pattern is a pattern for an 8×8 square. Well, without further ado ….
The Pattern for the Linen Stitch
Lost in translation ? No .. this stitch was perfectly translated from the traditional needle knit pattern to the loom by Lisa Clarke for their Luxurious Loom Knit Neck Warmer. THANK YOU Lisa ! That said, I did make one small change in that I use a different version of the knit stitch. I did this because I used a lighter weight of yarn and I wanted the bumping part to show up more.
They use the small 24-peg large gauge Knifty Knitter loom and chunky yarn . As you can see, it looks great. Nice rich red tone. I feel warmer already. But alas, It's January and 76 degrees here in Florida…. so no chunky yarn for me.
For my giant 8×8 square swatch I decided to use the Authentic Knitting Board's Adjustable Hat Loom in the small 1/2 inch gauge setting and Vickie Howell's Sheepish yarn in the Chartreuse-ish color. It is a worsted weight yarn. Love this yarn !
If you want to knit a square like mine for an afghan or blanket the pattern for it is below the Linen Stitch Pattern .
THE BASIC PATTERN
To Purchase a Printable PDF: Click HERE
Row 1: Knit 1, Slip 1 wyif repeat
Row 2: Knit
Row 3: Slip 1 wyif, Knit 1 repeat
Row 4: Knit
You are just flipping Row 1 and Row 3 and putting a row of knit stitches in between the 2 rows.
Notes – My Change to the Pattern: Unlike Lisa who uses a Flat Knit Stitch I used the e-Wrap Knit Stitch through-out the pattern, only because I found that with the worsted weight yarn the stitch looked bolder,the knitting went faster and with less tension
See the video tutorial at the bottom of the post
.
Pattern for an 8×8 Afghan / Blanket Square
Notes: Just one thing to keep in mind ; I am making it for a blanket so it has no pretty border. e-Warp stitch throughout the pattern. Slip the stitches on the edges.
Loom: 1/2 inch gauge loom. I used the Authentic Knitting Board's Adjustable Hat Loom
Stitches: Knit (e-Wrap), Slip 1 with yarn in front
Gauge: 4 Stitches and 5 Rows = 1 inch (Approximately)
Cast-on : e-Wrap cast-on 32 pegs
Row 1: Knit
Row 2: K1, *Knit 1, slip 1 wyif repeat from * to last 2 then K2
Row 3: Knit
Row 4. K2, *Slip 1 wyif, Knit 1 repeat from * to last then K1
Row 5: Knit
Repeat Rows 2 – 5 until you reach 8 inches. My square took 45 Rows to complete.
Bind-off: Basic Bind-off
To correct rolling edges tighten Loose Loops and Block your square.
Video Tutorial: Linen Stitch
I always recommend watching the video from beginning til the end before attempting the project. This makes the task easier and makes you bolder on your knitting journey. Feel free to leave me any questions or comments. And if you like the video : Subscribe !

Is it possible to avoid ideologies?[1]
In Italy, after about 70 years, Fascism is still a dissonant heritage. To be sure, there is a past not yet elaborated by Italians. The topic is more often than not, after the end of the so-called 1st Republic, exploited by the political forces in a quite rigid framework: from the myth of the partisans on the left, to the revisionism – indulgence toward fascism – on the right.
Is Italy an exception? Apparently the answer is negative. Indeed, socialist Yugoslavia and its remembrance are not experiencing an easy life in the public memory.
After the end of WW2, the new socialist regime lead by Josip Broz – Tito, had to re-write the narrative of their country after the tragic experience of the war, the dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom and the so-called fratricide conflict. Talking about the recent past, during socialism, it was not allowed to discuss about the war avoiding a regime sponsored narrative, in which the partisans were the heroes. It was, politically, a taboo: to adopt a critical thinking was not allowed because it was an attack to the regime.
The partisan myth went unchallenged for decades, but then, in the 1980s, after the death of Tito, the first critics grew, from Slovenia to Serbia. During the first half of the 80s, some irresolute attempts of repression of the dissent failed (as the so-called white book of Stipe Suvar, or the repression of some intellectuals by Stane Dolanc, head of the security services). The public intellectuals, that criticized, at some extent, the regime, attacked vehemently exactly that myth: the partisan heroic war, Tito etc. They did so because it was a way to attack the politicians and the government. To many Yugoslav citizens, at the end of the 1980s, the partisan myth was nothing more than empty rhetoric, empty and outdated words. It had no real appeal on the population, it was not anymore a mobilizing factor: at the time just nationalism was able to mobilize the people.
The rhetoric adopted by the dissidents usually was nationalist (Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian etc.) and at the time was usually interpreted as democratic by the West. In other words, socialist Yugoslavia got money and help also from the West – in particular the USA exploited the heresy of the titoist regime in the European eastern flanks as an instrument against the Soviet Union. At the same time, while during the Cold war a stable regime in Belgrade was functional for Washington, the opponents, critics and dissenters of socialist Yugoslavia were generally welcomed and supported by the very same West, while not formally or officially. The long term goal was to promote, one day, a pluralistic democracy in Yugoslavia.
The socialist regime punished, in an authoritarian way, the dissent, blocking their career, with imprisonment, banning them from the political life or even killing some opponents abroad. While Yugoslav socialism was far more liberal compared to the Eastern bloc (because of the travel's freedom, the consumerism, just to mention a couple), it was, without doubts, an authoritarian, illiberal political regime. The regime did not avoid censorship and political persecution and repression against any form of political criticism. This historical heritage was just made more controversial with the end of the regime, the dissolution of the common Yugoslav state and, in the end, with the wars during the first half of the 1990s.
In the main former Yugoslav republics, there was – and still is – a major trend in the use of public history and the memories of socialism. While each republic developed its own narrative – because they had to justify the independence from the past federation in the last twenty years, generally speaking, the rhetoric about the independence is mainly a prerogative of the center-right. On the other side, to indulge toward Yugoslavia and socialism is seen as a prerogative of the center-left, and in particular (but not only) the social-democrat parties heirs of the national league of communists.
What does it mean practically? Recently, in Croatia, for example, the political advisor of the President of the Republic was fired during the pre-electoral campaign for the presidential elections, because they wrote that the referendum about independence (held in 1991) was not properly legal. In the national discourse in Croatia the patriotic war is the prevailing myth, everything that is connected or linked with socialism is seen by the voters of the center right and their interested leaders as something horrible, a crime, a dangerous revisionism. Still, just recently, in Rijeka a new university center about the studies of socialism emerged (such the everyday life of the people during socialism etc). Moreover, a younger generation of historians is trying to rehabilitate part of the socialist era, going on public debate in the media. Anyway, to be sure, to be too soft toward socialism or, even worst, to question the independence of Croatia is a kind of taboo in the public discourse.
While I can't talk about every single former Yugoslav republic, I would like to mention few other cases. In Slovenia, the political feud between the center left and the center right is basically an everyday matter. For example, in 2009 there was an exhibition at the Museum of the contemporary history about the Slovenian 1989 and a celebration of its independence of Slovenia from Yugoslavia. This is the kind of cultural product that is functional for the right, such as Janez Jansa. The very same year, a street in Ljubljana was named after Tito, but a court in 2011 considered it unconstitutional. In 2011 a 2 euro commemorative coin portrayed Franc Rozman, a Slovenian partisan, and again new polemics in the public opinion emerged (with some minor indignation in Italy, because it was linked, symbolically with the “foibe” topic, which is by itself very controversial). Among the most recent case, I can mention the referendum advanced by the center right about opening and digitalizing all the documents in the archives of the ministry of internal affairs. The basic idea was to attack publicly the Slovenian citizens who collaborated with the regime as informers. In the end the referendum did not achieve its goals (actually it was a very long and expensive project).
What about Serbia? Serbia had quite a different path compared to Slovenia and Croatia. It was a kind of latecomer. Since during the 1990s the former communists held power – Milosevic – the process of revision of the public memory started just in the past decade and still is ongoing. Milosevic's regime maintained the same currency (dinar), the same name of the country (Yugoslavia), and never repudiated the socialist inheritance. When the opposition in 1996/97 got the power in the city of Belgrade (Zoran Djindjic), the red star on the top of the town hall was promptly removed. On the contrary, in the years following the 5th October 2000, new/old names were given to the streets (such as Bulevar revolucije/kralja Aleksandra), with a very strange effect to the least. Politically, the Socialist party of Serbia, recently took distance from the 1990s and the years of euphoric nationalism (this is also an effect of the EU pressures), but did not make a radical U turn toward socialism. SPS still is the heir of the socialist memory. Ivica Dacic, the leader of the SPS, last year spent generous words towards the widow of Tito (Jovanka), and somehow tried to reconsider the figure of Rankovic, the chief of the security services fall in disgrace in the 60s. The center right supports a process of historical revision in order to 1) denounce the crimes of the partisans, especially at the end of WW2 (e.g. with exhibitions and TV series), and 2) trace the corpses of the victims of partisans, including Draza Mihailovic, the former head of the Chetniks, the royalist Serbian army. In other words, there it is clearly an attempt to shape a new and alternative discourse that could represent the values of the right wing public opinion of Serbia.
If we change republic, such as in Macedonia, the situation is not that different after all: the right, the VMRO-DPMNE nationalist party, is pushing for a wave of “lustracija” (the intent is similar to the right in Slovenia – to accuse members of the current establishment of being collaborators of the criminal socialist regime). In Kosovo there are recent cases of destruction of partisans monuments, because they are connected with the idea of Yugoslavia, Serbia and oppression of the Albanian population. Bosnia and Herzegovina is somehow mirroring the quarrels of its neighbors, while Tito is still a kind of popular hero among part of the Muslim population (because the regime recognized Muslims as a nation in the 1960s and supported Bosnia as a third player between Serbia and Croatia).
As we can see, the socialist memories of Yugoslavia are a battlefield used and abused by political parties. Socialist Yugoslavia was not able to confront its past because of the regime. The democratic regimes are confronting the past with a very parochial point of view, opposing and comparing a crime with another one. At the same time, the memories of socialism, who is seen today by many across the boundaries with indulgence because at that time there was work, money, welfare state etc. But the public opinions of former Yugoslavia is actually “overcrowded”. They have to cope with the myth of independence (generally speaking), they have to deal with the wars (and the cooperation with the ICTY). On the top of that, there is one more dissonance process, such as to recognize that the recent past was a kind of evil and the public opinion should take distance from certain events (e.g. the paramilitary formations in Bosnia and their war crimes). The very same fact that t-shirts with Ratko Mladic are sold at the bus station in Belgrade, or Ante Gotovina is considered a hero (and it is quite common to find graffiti depicting them in Dalmatia), is a signal that the field of public history and shared memories is, to the least, controversial, and is undergoing some sort of revisionism. Finally, the EU is pushing the Western Balkans, directly and indirectly, to assume a different approach toward their recent past, because EU members should not have open conflicts. The transition from a nationalistically minded public discourse to a one politically correct, as usually prevail in the West, is not an easy one. To consider the cultural heritage as just a piece of history, that could be economically exploited (e.g. with tourism), is very hard when contemporary events are in question, because it opens fresh scars.

T. Boone Pickens' energy plan isn't powered by details
T. BOONE PICKENS describes themselves as an oil-and-gas man, but what they have really been adept at producing over the years are attention and ruckus, with them at the center of both.
Back in their corporate raiding days in the 1980s, their takeover bids for Gulf, Phillips and Unocal generated so much attention and ruckus that just the suggestion that Pickens might take a run at The Boeing Co. was enough to scare the Washington Legislature into special session to enact a bill to thwart such hostile threats.
Pickens is back in the headlines, on television -- and in a forum they didn't have 20 years ago, the Internet -- to promote an energy plan called, surprisingly enough, the Pickens Plan. The decisive and bold plan (his characterization), they say, is a national call to action at a time of crisis to break the reliance on foreign oil and provide "cleaner, cheaper and domestic energy resources."
The details and components of the Pickens Plan?
More wind power to generate electricity. And natural gas as a motor fuel.
That's it.
That's it?
Cue your favorite sound effect at this point -- chirping crickets or nervous throat-clearing and paper rustling. At some point, the uncomfortable quiet will have to be broken by someone pointing out a few, shall we say, nuances and complications to such a straightforward proposal.
First, it's not as though neither idea occurred to anyone before Pickens enlightened us. The taxi you ride from Sea-Tac to downtown is likely powered by natural gas. Truck manufacturer Paccar plans to build liquefied- natural-gas heavy-duty trucks at its Kenworth Renton plant next year.
Extensive wind farms with hundreds of turbines are already generating electricity in Eastern Washington and Oregon. More are coming.
Second, there's the little matter of getting the energy to its user. Pickens envisions planting a swath of the Midwest and Great Plains, from North Dakota to Texas, with wind turbines (to illustrate why there, the Pickens Plan Web site uses a map from Seattle-based 3Tier, which assesses wind, solar and hydro potential). But that's not where the people are. Getting the electricity to them will cost hundreds of billions on top of the $1 trillion bill for the wind farms (those estimates are from the Pickens Plan, which maintains that it's a bargain compared with the tab for foreign oil).
The attraction of gasoline as a motor fuel is that the distribution system, built over decades, is already in place. Natural gas works decently for motor vehicles for fleets that operate from a central dispatching and refueling center. Maybe one day we'll have car refueling ports in our home, connected to the same lines that supply our furnaces and water heaters. But those will cost someone money, as will refueling stations, should we want to venture out a way.
Leaving aside those issues (and a trillion bucks is a lot to set aside), we come to the small matter of whether we'll have enough wind or natural gas to do what will be asked of them.
For natural gas, the issue is supply. Some in the energy industry, such as Puget Sound Energy Chief Executive Steve Reynolds, have been warning that natural gas supplies just for the uses we've got now -- home water and space heating, industry, electricity production and a small bit of transportation -- are thin enough as they are. "On a world basis there is plenty of natural gas available for an extended period of time," they say. "Whether there is in North America is another question."
True, there's a lot of gas in Alaska (provided it can get to the Lower 48, and there's that pesky issue of expensive infrastructure again) and western Canada. But Reynolds says those supplies will at best offset the decline in production from current U.S. reserves.
The most promising relief from tighter supplies and volatile prices, they say, are imports of liquefied natural gas. Provided, of course, you can build LNG terminals, no easy feat, as recent bruising battles in Oregon have suggested.
For wind, the issue is availability. For an illustration of the problem, drive up to Puget's new visitor center at its Wild Horse wind farm 16 miles east of Ellensburg.
At midmorning on a recent bright summer day, the center offered a sweeping view of the installation's 127 turbines -- only a handful of which were turning, none at sufficient speeds to generate electricity (the turbines work at wind speeds of 9 to 55 miles per hour, Puget says).
Later in the day, the utility reports, the wind picks up considerably and the electricity flows. That's great, if that's the time of day you happen to want power. If you'd like it at other hours, you're going to need something else.
In the Northwest, that something else is the hydro system. But it's also natural gas, the very fuel the Pickens Plan wants to divert from electricity generation to motor vehicles.
"You run the wind when you can, just like we run the hydro when we can because the incremental cost is very low," Reynolds says. "But then you have to be concerned about the reliability of the system, and that you're protected and that you can meet loads when you lose your lower-cost and volatile resource."
That's why Puget is investing in both wind and natural gas. Taking natural gas out of the electricity business "would be nice if there were alternatives," Reynolds says, but for now it's the best option.
Is there a good long-term alternative? "We're all looking for it," Reynolds says. "That's why we've got the solar panels" now being installed at Wild Horse.
At least the Northwest has the hydro option. If other parts of the country are gong to rely more heavily on wind, what are they going to "firm up" that power with, if not natural gas? Some out-of-favor fuel such as coal or nuclear?
The most workable and affordable energy plan is one that throws in pieces of everything, from increased oil and gas exploration and production to increased conservation and efficiency in heating and transportation to multiple fuels and power sources for vehicles and electricity generation, old and new (wind, solar, tidal, geothermal, biofuels, even new coal technologies and a nuke or two).
Such an approach doesn't make for flashy advertising campaigns or snappy slogans. It will have to do, though, until the technology arrives to convert Pickens' ability to generate near inexhaustible amounts of attention, hype and publicity into a similarly inexhaustible resource for generating electricity and motor-vehicle fuel.
Moving to quell the uproar over the return of big paydays on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs announced on Thursday that its top executives would forgo cash bonuses this year and that it would give shareholders a say in determining compensation.
With a resurgent Goldman set to award billions of dollars in bonuses — a trove that could rival the record payouts of the bubble years — the bank said that its 30 most-senior executives would be paid in the form of a special stock, rather than in cash. Goldman said that it would also let its shareholders vote on its executives' pay, although the decision would be nonbinding.
A year after Washington rescued the nation's financial industry with billions of taxpayer dollars, Goldman is enjoying one of the most profitable years in its 140-year history. Its bonanza — fostered by its own government bailout, as well as the rescue of the broader financial system — has angered the many ordinary Americans who are still waiting for an economic recovery.
Much of the resentment has been directed at Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who after first staunchly defending the bank's outsize profits and pay, and then bristling at calls for restraint, apologized for mistakes that led to the financial crisis.

Whether Goldman's shareholders will contest its pay practices is uncertain. Goldman insists that it must pay its employees well to keep them from defecting to rivals. So far, it has set aside $16.7 billion to pay its workers this year, a figure that translates into roughly $700,000 an employee. Top producers will earn millions.

Goldman stockholders, who have been richly rewarded as the bank's share price soared roughly 82 percent this year, may be reluctant to challenge the bank's pay practices. Indeed, Goldman has reached out to big investors to make its case.

A lawsuit has been filed against a San Diego-area school district for its student yoga curriculum, claiming the exercise classes are "inherently and pervasively religious."
The National Center for Law and Policy filed the lawsuit on Wednesday on behalf of Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their children, who are students in the Encinitas Union School District.
The district last fall began offering yoga during physical education classes. Children have the choice to opt out of the program.
The Sedlocks allege the school district is not complying with the California constitution's right to religious freedom. The lawsuit also calls the children participating in the program "religious guinea pigs."
Encintas schools accepted a $533,000 grant for the yoga classes from the Jois Foundation, which the conservative legal firm that filed the lawsuit claims is a religious organization. The attorney who filed the suit called the relationship between the foundation and the school district "improperly cozy."
Jois Yoga states on its website that it works as an "extension of the Ashtanga philosophy and practice." The organization is based in Encinitas, where Ashtanga yoga was first introduced to the United States, according to the website.
The yoga group's foundation is focused on "educating the whole child" by bringing yoga to schools, particularly in underserved communities.
School district Superintendent Timothy Baird said he's shocked a lawsuit was filed against the district.
"We have not stripped religion out of it. We never put religion in it," Baird said. "What we took out were cultural connections, so we don't use Sanskrit words. But basically what you have kids doing is stretching, moving, breathing. That's not religious."
An FAQ on the program on the district's website states: "There is no discussion of spiritualism, mysticism, religion in any context. The students simply perform the physical components of movement and breathing related to mainstream yoga."
Yoga originated thousands of years ago in India and is associated with Hinduism and other Eastern religions. In recent decades, it has become the subject of widespread practice across the United States, often with little spiritual element to classes.
In a press release issued by Escondido-based National Center for Law and Policy, attorney Dean Broyles said the Encinitas yoga program was a "breach of public trust" that sets a "dangerous precedent."
"This is frankly the clearest case of the state trampling on the religious freedom rights of citizens that I have personally witnessed in my 18 years of practice as a constitutional attorney," Broyles said.
The lawsuit, which alleges civil rights violations, was filed in San Diego Superior Court. It ultimately seeks to suspend the yoga program indefinitely and "restore traditional physical education to the district."
The National Center for Law and Policy is a nonprofit legal group focused on conservative causes, including religious freedom, as well as "the sanctity of life, traditional marriage, parental rights, and other civil liberties," according to its website.

With spring football in full swing – two teams play spring games Saturday – let's see how the NCAA would rank the 2014 college football strength of schedule.
RELATED: 2014 SEC Strength of Schedule
This is based on opponents' win-loss record from the previous year; so, it's not perfect. The opponents' win percentage is calculated by adding up the total wins and losses for the 12 teams on the schedule.
A couple flaws exist ranking schedules this way, as noted by Phil Steele. The first flaw would be a 10-2 FCS opponent shouldn't carry the same weight as a 7-6 FBS team. In this method, they carry more weight. Secondly, the records are from the previous season, which was an entirely different team.
But it's fun to look at where the SEC's strength of schedule compares to other teams around the country. SDS will rank our own schedules closer to the season.
The NCAA would say Arkansas has the country's toughest schedule, followed by Tennessee, Texas A&M and Kentucky in the top 10. All SEC teams are bolded below:

Lance Franklin is set to join teammates for pre-season training in December.
Star forward Lance Franklin is on track to join senior teammates when they return to training in early December.
Franklin returned to the club earlier this month to undergo their standard end of season exit interview with the club's coaches and medical staff after taking personal leave to deal with their ongoing mental health condition.
General Manager of Football Tom Harley said the club was confident of a return from the star forward at the beginning of pre-season training.
“He will be back when the other players are due for sure,” Harley said.
“Lance is training at the moment; they are in preparation for pre-season mode which is what players do now.
“He is in good spirits and in pretty good physical condition as well.”
The club's first to fourth year players return to the track on November 23 with the remainder of the playing group to commence training the following week.
It will be the first time new Swans Callum Sinclair and Michael Talia get the opportunity to meet their new teammates after joining the club during the trade period.
The first training session will also be the first official chance for International Rookie Colin O'Riordan to meet their new teammates as they make the relocation from Ireland.
'These are tactics that are well-known. You start by tearing down statues and burning books, and eventually you go after people.'
Federalist senior correspondent John Daniel Davidson joined Fox News's “Tucker Carlson Tonight” to explain why the Left's impulse to tear down Confederate monuments is totalitarian. Davidson noted that leftists calling for the destruction of statues memorializing Confederate figures has been going on for quite some time.
“I remember two years ago we had the 150th anniversary of the Confederate surrender and you had people in the mainstream media at that time calling for the desecration of Confederate graves,” Davidson said. “Not just tearing down statues but digging up remains, removing them. You know, bulldozing over cemeteries — and this iconoclastic impulse is native to the Left. This is what China's cultural revolution was all about. If you want to see where tearing down statues by mobs will get you, look at pictures of China's cultural revolution where they tore down statues, temples.”
“This is not about the Confederacy,” they continued. “This is not about the Civil War. This is about political power and it's about a small group of people on the Left trying to exert outside influence on American politics by following in the footsteps of Mao, of the armed thugs in Weimar Republic, of the Taliban. These are tactics that are well-known. You start by tearing down statues, and burning books, and eventually you go after people.”
“This is what happens with identity politics,” they said. “If you push identity politics, eventually you get around to identity politics for white people, which is a dangerous thing in a country that has a huge white majority. You know, this is why the Left has been sowing these seeds of what's been happening for a long time. Are they surprised eventually some white people are going to say, ‘Yeah, let's do identity politics,' and we have white identity politics. It's all poisonous garbage.”
“It's totally un-American, too,” Davidson said of the totalitarian impulses exhibited by both leftist protestors and white supremacists. “America is not about ethnicity. It's not about national origin. It's about creed. There is no place in the American constitutional system for identity politics, left or right. Plain and simple.”

A lot less people are interested in what conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh has to say after they called Georgetown University law student a “slut” and a “prostitute,” according to one industry ratings source.
Politico reported on Monday that Abritron's key demographic ratings between March 29 and April 25 showed Limbaugh's show had fallen 27 percent in New York City, 31 percent in Houston, 35 percent in Jacksonville and 40 percent in the Seattle-Tacoma market.
“Clearly Sandra Fluke isn't the only one who didn't like Rush calling them a ‘slut' given how many viewers that comment incinerated,” a listener told Politico‘s Dylan Byers.
In late March, Limbaugh had claimed that the ratings were up by between 10 percent and 60 percent after they called Fluke a “slut” because they advocated that health insurance cover contraception for women.
“The advertisers who hung in here are going gangbusters, yes,” they told their listeners. “I mean, that's the simple truth. The only ones who got hurt are the ones who left.”
A radio insider speculated to Politico that Limbaugh's ratings had briefly surged as new listeners tuned in to hear them respond to the controversy.
Earlier this month, Cumulus CEO Lew Dickey said that their company had lost millions dollars after dozens of advertisers pulled their sponsorship from Limbaugh's show. Dickey added that the radio giant was “hit pretty hard” by the loss.
The Arbitron report also indicated that ratings were up by as much as 79 percent in both the San Francisco and Las Vegas markets.
The effects of regular exercise on our health – both physical and psychological – are well known. Many people with diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, even osteoarthritis see improvements once they begin to exercise, sometimes to the point that medications are reduced or even no longer necessary. And yet, according to recent surveys, only 49% of Americans meet recommended physical activity guidelines.
Researchers have found another significant exercise-health connection: adults who do not exercise on a regular basis have a 20% higher risk of having a stroke than do their more active peers, according to a study published earlier this week in the journal Stroke. This research backs up earlier findings, including those from a 2010 multi-country study that identified physical inactivity as the second leading risk factor for strokes. This current study, however, is the first to look at such a large multiracial group of both men and women.
Each year, nearly 800,000 people in the United States experience a stroke, referred to medically as a “cerebral vascular accident” or CVA. That comes out to one person every 40 seconds. Strokes are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S., taking 130,000 lives annually. It is also the leading cause of disability.
For this study, researchers followed more than 27,000 Americans who were 45 years old or older to see what impact physical exercise had on their health. The study participants were divided into three groups: those who reported exercising once a week or less (not physically active), those who exercised one to three times per week, and those who exercised four or more times per week (moderately active). The participants did not report on the duration of exercise, just how often exercise was performed.
One third of all the participants reported that they were not physically active and it was this sampling that had the highest risk of stroke. The patients who had the lowest stroke risk were those who exercised four days or more per week. “Unlike heart disease, in which even mild to moderate exercise has good benefit, [preventing] stroke is trickier,” says Osman Mir, MB., BS, neurologist on staff at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas. People who exercised two to three times per week did have some benefit over those who did not, but it was those who exercised the most who had the greater advantage. This is in line with the current physical activity recommendations, says Mir: “The American Heart Association recommends that you exercise for 30 minutes on more days of the week than not. That would give you four days per week.” The advantage was more obvious in men than in women.
For people who still aren't convinced that exercise is all that necessary, Mir points out that some studies have shown that the risk of stroke from inactivity is not all that different from the risk of stroke from smoking.But getting that exercise can be daunting if you've gotten out of the habit or never ascribed to it in the first place.
“I think the biggest problem for people is when they think they have to all of a sudden go out and do an hour of cardiovascular exercise and then they have to really pound out a huge workout to make it worthwhile,” says David Jeter, MPT, CMPT, a physiotherapist and owner of Acceleration Physical Therapy in Spokane, WA. But that is just setting up yourself up for failure and you have to feed off your successes. “If that means just five minutes of walking, then that is what you can do and then hopefully you can build on that,” explains Jeter.
Not sure of what type of exercise you might like? Try thinking about what you enjoyed when you were younger. “You can do a stationary bicycle if you liked biking as a kid,” suggests Mir. If joint pain makes walking or running painful, swimming may be an option, as can be an elliptical machine, which puts minimal stress on your joints.
Jeter agrees and points out that many people think that they can't exercise or they have to stop exercising because they have pain, particularly in the knees, hips, or back. Of course, pain should always be assessed and people who are inactive should speak to their doctor before embarking on a new exercise program, but a proper exercise program could actually reduce the pain in the long run, depending on its cause.
“Our bodies were built to move, to run and walk, and move vastly more than we do in our society,” says Jeter. “Sitting is just plain killing us in various ways, whether it be from stroke, from heart attack, or degenerative joint disease. We've got to move more than we are.”
The rate of heat building up on Earth over the past decade is equivalent to detonating about 4 Hiroshima atomic bombs per second. Take a moment to visualize 4 atomic bomb detonations happening every single second. That's the global warming that we're frequently told isn't happening.
There are periods when the ocean heats up more quickly than the surface, and other periods when the surface heats up more quickly than the oceans. Right now we're in a period of fast ocean warming and overall, global warming is continuing at a very fast pace.
The confusion on this subject lies in the fact that only about 2 percent of global warming is used in heating air, whereas about 90 percent of global warming goes into heating the oceans (the rest heats ice and land masses). But humans live at the Earth's surface, and thus we tend to focus on surface temperatures. Over the past 10–15 years, Earth's surface temperature has continued to rise, but slowly. At the same time, the warming of the oceans – and the warming of the Earth as a whole – has accelerated.
This was the conclusion of a scientific paper I co-authored last year, in which our team found more overall global warming (of the oceans, air, land, and ice combined) over the past 15 years than during the prior 15 years. Just recently, another paper published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters found that the warming of the oceans since the turn of the century has been the most sustained in the past 50 years. They also found that, consistent with my team's research, about 30% of overall global warming has gone into the deep oceans below 700 meters due to changing wind patterns and ocean currents. This accelerated deep ocean warming is also unprecedented in the past 50 years.
We often hear from the media that the (surface air) warming has slowed or paused over the past 15 years. This isn't a puzzle; climate scientists are well aware of several contributing factors, as a recent Reuters article – "Climate scientists struggle to explain warming slowdown" – eventually discussed. The accelerated warming of the oceans is likely the main contributor.
During years with La Niña events, more heat is transferred to the oceans, and surface temperatures are relatively cool as a result. The opposite is true during El Niño years. During the 1990s, there were more El Niño than La Niña events, which resulted in more surface air warming. One of the strongest El Niño events of the century happened in 1998, which not coincidentally was 15 years ago.
When people say 'no warming in 15 years', they're cherry picking the timeframe to begin in an abnormally hot year. It's like arguing that your car must have broken down because it hasn't moved in the 15 seconds while you've been stopped at a red light. The argument selects a short timeframe that's not representative of the whole.
Since 2000, there has been a preponderance of La Niña events, which has acted to temporarily bury more global warming in the oceans. A new study published in Nature Climate Change found that by taking into account the short-term changes caused by factors like El Niño and La Niña cycles, they could accurately forecast the slowed warming at the surface several years in advance. The paper concluded,
"Our results hence point at the key role of the ocean heat uptake in the recent warming slowdown."
Reuters did not talk to the authors of this study, or ask any other climate scientists about this surface warming slowdown that they're supposed to be puzzled about. Actually that's not quite true. Just a week earlier, Reuters interviewed the lead author of that paper in an article with the headline "Oceans may explain slowdown in climate change". The article noted,
"Experts in France and Spain said on Sunday that the oceans took up more warmth from the air around 2000. That would help explain the slowdown in surface warming but would also suggest that the pause may be only temporary and brief."
Reuters didn't connect the dots between these two articles, telling us one week that oceans help explain the surface warming slowdown, and the next week claiming the slowdown is puzzling climate scientists. However, these 'slowdowns' happen on a regular basis. You can find one every 5 to 10 years in the surface temperature data, as illustrated in a graphic I created nicknamed 'The Escalator'.
Average of NASA GISS, NOAA NCDC, and HadCRUT4 monthly global surface temperature anomalies from January 1970 through November 2012 (green) with linear trends applied to the timeframes Jan '70 - Oct '77, Apr '77 - Dec '86, Sep '87 - Nov '96, Jun '97 - Dec '02, and Nov '02 - Nov '12.
During periods with more La Niñas, surface temperatures temporarily flatten out. But global warming does not. As long as humans continue to increase the greenhouse effect by burning massive quantities of fossil fuels, the planet will continue to warm, as is clear from the acceleration of global warming since 2000.

Obama Orders Rising Seas Built In to Building Standards
Flood risk from sea level rise brought about by climate change will have to be factored into the building standards of any new and rebuilt federally funded construction project, including those built by local governments receiving federal money, according to an executive order President Obama issued Friday.
The order requires projects funded by the government to adopt tighter construction standards so that scientific projections for how climate change could affect flooding in a given area can be factored into where and how the projects are built.

The executive order is a huge shift for the federal government, which has relied mostly on historical flooding data when determining the location of flood plains, not projections for how flooding may change in the future.
Builders now have several options to reduce a project's vulnerability to flooding: They can use the best available climate science to determine the best place in a flood plain to reduce exposure to future floods as sea level rises, or they can construct new buildings two feet above the 100-year flood mark and build new hospitals and other critical buildings three feet above the 100-year flood mark. Or, they can build all projects above the 500-year flood mark.
The building standards are to be updated every five years using the latest flood risk projections based on available climate science.
The order follows a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers report released earlier in January assessing the flood risk climate change poses for communities along the East Coast following Hurricane Sandy.
“Hurricane Sandy brought to light the reality that coastal storms are intensifying and that sea-level change and climate change will only heighten the vulnerability of coastal communities,” Brig. Gen. Kent D. Savre, commanding general of the Army Corps' North Atlantic Division, said in a statement.
In a statement, the White House singled out the flooding in Manhattan that occurred as Sandy came ashore in 2012 as a reason to rebuild infrastructure to a higher standard so it can withstand greater storm surges and other coastal flooding.
More than $1 trillion of property are at risk from two feet of sea level rise in the U.S., a level that could be reached by 2050, the statement said.

The rate of sea level rise on the Atlantic Coast is accelerating and has already risen at least 8 inches on both coasts since 1880. Because of the melting of glaciers and the expansion of the warming ocean, between 10 inches and several feet of global sea level rise is expected by 2100. Some projections show it leading to more than 10 feet of rise in the next two centuries, affecting more than 12 million people in the U.S. and nearly 29,000 square miles of land.
Higher sea levels mean more devastating floods. Low-lying urban areas such as those along New York City's coastline, many of which were devastated during Sandy, could have up to a 3-in-4 chance of historically unprecedented flooding by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not dramatically reduced. About $100 billion in property sits within flood-vulnerable areas of New York City, and the homes of nearly 500,000 people are at risk of climate change-driven sea level rise there.
Sea level rise is also causing less dramatic nuisance flooding, with some cities such as Washington, D.C., already seeing 30 days or more of flooding annually, according to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study released last year.
Other cities such as Baltimore and Charleston, S.C., could see 30 days or more of nuisance flooding because of sea level rise by 2020, followed by San Francisco and Philadelphia in 2030.

12-year-old Loyal Grandstaff loves their Bible. So you can imagine how miffed they felt when their teacher at Bueker Middle School in Marshall, Missouri told them they aren't allowed to read it in school:
Loyal says they love reading their Bible and decided to bring it to school before the Christmas break so they could read it during their free time. But the seventh grader said their teacher told them it wasn't allowed. “I like to read my Bible because it's a good book,” Loyal said. They said they aren't reading out loud and said they aren't sharing the Bible with their classmates.
That's… pretty messed up. I mean, I'm on the kid's side. Who wouldn't be?
How did Principal Lance Tobin respond to all this? A few days after Monica Evans reported the story for FOX 4 — Kansas City, they finally had a chance to investigate the story and their conclusion was… surprising to say the least:
[Tobin] told TheBlaze on Friday that claims made by Loyal Grandstaff, a 7th grader at the school, had not been substantiated when a local outlet published them and that the situation has since been resolved. “We just all agreed and we talked about school and religion,” Tobin said. “And I wanted to make sure that they were comfortable understanding that their child could have the Bible at school and could read the Bible at school.” Tobin, who declined to go into specific detail when asked why the family alleged that a teacher had banned the 12 year old from reading the book if that story wasn't accurate, said that going public with the claims was likely “something that [the family] felt like they needed to do at the time.” When asked how the teacher accused of banning the Bible is faring in light of the attention the situation has been given, the principal added, “There is no teacher involved whatsoever.”
… the hell?
I appreciate how Tobin isn't throwing the family (or student) under the bus for what appears to be a fabricated story, but make no mistake, that's all this is.
It was a ridiculous one to begin with, too. I mean, when it comes to accusations you shouldn't believe, “Christians are persecuted in America” falls just under “Sarah Palin said something intelligent.”
The blame for this becoming a pseudo-controversy falls on Justin Grandstaff, the father in this story, who spoke with Evans on Monday:
Justin says they haven't been able to talk to the teacher in question or the principal because of the Christmas break, but they plan to talk to them when school reopens on Tuesday.
In other words, they didn't bother talking to them about this issue because the school was on break… but they felt perfectly fine accusing them of wrong-doing and publicly shaming them without hearing all the facts.
Watch out, Todd Starnes. You have competition in the bullshit department.

“Cops Charge 7-Year-Old for Bringing Toy Gun To Class.” “Police charged the 7-year-old with possessing an imitation firearm in or on an education institution – a misdemeanor and a minor juvenile offense in New Jersey.” This “was a $5 toy gun, similar to a Nerf gun, that shoots soft ping pong type balls, according to the school's superintendent”; the video attached to the story suggests the toy looks like a real gun, but it didn't show the toy, so it's hard to tell.
Why all the administrative measures the school system could take are insufficient, and the criminal law has to respond, is beyond me. Nothing in the story suggests that somehow the 7-year-old had, in past incidents, proved themselves unwilling to respond to administrative measures: “School officials described the child as ‘a nice kid' and ‘a good student.'”
Of course, such actions have an effect beyond the particular student, and send a message to the public at large. But this message, I think, will not only be “never ever ever bring nerf-guns to school.” Rather, I suspect that it will be the message suggested in the headline to the post.
Thanks to Little Miss Attila for the pointer.
The nation's highways will connect more than 90 percent of cities with a population of more than 200,000 by the end of 2015, according to a report released by the Ministry of Transport Thursday.Sun Guoqing, director of the planning department of the Ministry of Transport, said at a press conference Thursday that by the end of the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-15), the national highway network will be basically completed, and its total length will reach 108,000 kilometers.China had no highways before 1988, while by the end of 2010, the length of highways under construction was 74,000 kilometers, coming a close second to the US. According to statistics, both the US and Japan spent more than 40 years building their national highway networks, while China will have spent only half of that time to do it, China News Service (CNS) reported.The rapid rate of construction has resulted in various problems, such as the illegal charging of toll fees."Without the policy of charging tolls on the roads, there would not have been the achievement in the present Chinese transport situation and the development of roads in the countryside," Weng Mengyong, vice minister of transport, said at a press conference earlier this year.Pan Xiaojun, director of the fixed asset investment department of the National Audit Office, said that the policy of "building roads with loans and then repaying the loans through tolls" will continue for a certain period in the future, reported CNS.But according to a report from the Beijing Municipal Audit Bureau, by the end of December 2004, the Beijing section of the Beijing-Shijiazhuang highway had collected 1.7 billion yuan ($262 million) in tolls and made a profit of about 600 million yuan ($92 million) after repaying its loans.Some roads also reportedly have irregularities in charging tolls. The Shandong-based Jinan Daily reported that 16 provinces and municipalities including Hubei and Liaoning provinces built 158 illegal tollbooths on 100 roads that earned about 14.9 billion yuan ($2.29 billion) by 2005."Against the backdrop of high living prices, the high tolls from the highway have increased the cost of social operation and people's economic burdens," Zhou Minliang, a researcher at the Institute of Industrial Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Beijing-based The First.Zhou suggested that the tolls from highways be gradually abolished, and the relevant departments should make their financial situation known to the public.Zhang Zhuting, a professor at the Transport Management Institute affiliated with the Ministry of Transport, does not think the abolition of tolls will be a trend in the future."Without charging tolls, the public will be responsible for maintaining the roads by paying taxes, which is unfair to those who don't usually use the highways," Zhang said.
Episode 424: How Much Is A Firefighter Worth?
Enlarge this image Caitlin Kenney/NPR Caitlin Kenney/NPR
On today's show, we visit Fire Station Six in Contra Costa County, Calif.
Firefighters don't go to fires as much as they used to. That's because, thanks to modern building codes, fires are much less common than they used to be. Yet the fire dept is still set up the same way: big trucks, lots of fire stations, and lots of firefighters who retire with lifetime pensions.
Rather than close fire stations, the firefighters in Contra Costa County agreed to take a pay cut a few years back. But the county still couldn't afford the fire department.
So the firefighters came up with a new plan: Ask the local citizens to support the fire department by paying higher taxes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers newly applying for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week and regional manufacturing slipped in January, hinting at some slowing in the pace of economic recovery.

The Labor Department said on Thursday initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 36,000 to 482,000 last week as a backlog of applications from the holidays was processed. It was the third straight week that claims rose.
Analysts had expected new claims to slip to 440,000.
Separate data showed factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region slowed in January to a three-month low, while a gauge of economic prospects scaled a record high last month.
“The recovery of the U.S. economy continues, but it's at a slower pace than we have seen at the end of 2009. The biggest problem is companies remain reluctant to expand their capacities, which is weighing on the labor market,” said Harm Bandholz, an economist at Unicredit Research in New York.
Analysts believe the U.S. economy grew at an annual pace of between 4 and 5 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 2.2 percent rate seen in the July-September period.
The jobless data and plans by U.S. President Barack Obama to curb risk-taking by banks pressured U.S. stocks .N and enhanced the safe-haven allure of Treasury debt <US/>. There are fears the measures will limit bank profits.
The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI and the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX suffered their biggest one-day drops since October. The U.S. dollar tumbled against the yen <USD/>.
The Labor Department said the jump in initial claims for jobless aid last week was administrative and not economic.
Analysts, however, argued the rise suggested the figures for prior weeks had been understated, though that did not alter the labor market's course toward stability and job growth at least by March.
PREVIOUS CLAIMS UNDERSTATED
“That implies claims in previous weeks were understated so the reduction in new jobless claims between December and January is not as extreme as had been thought,” said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York.
“But with lay-offs diminishing, the labor market is still gradually healing.”
The claims data covered the survey week for the Labor Department's closely watched payrolls report for January, due on February 5. Employers unexpectedly cut 85,000 jobs last month.
Labor market weakness remains a major obstacle to the recovery, which started in the third quarter of 2009 following the longest and deepest downturn since the 1930s.
Analysts were not too troubled by the drop in the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index to 15.2 this month as orders fell.
The index, which measures factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region, hit a 4-1/2-year high of 22.5 in December. Markets had expected the index to come in at 18.0. A reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing.
The survey's employment index hit its highest since February 2008.
“The data still point to growth in activity this month, and we don't see any need to significantly alter our view that the factory sector is shifting from being on the mend to steady expansion,” said Omair Sharif, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
Bolstering views the recovery remains intact, the Conference Board, a business research group, said its index of leading economic indicators rose 1.1 percent to an all-time high of 106.4 last month.
Although the Labor Department report also showed the four-week moving average of new jobless claims, a measure of underlying trends, snapped a 19-week trend of declines last week, it remains below the 450,000 level that analysts say indicates stability in the labor market.

“Conditions are still improving. It might be only a few months before the economy generates sustained gains in employment,” said Paul Ashworth, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The number of workers still collecting benefits after an initial week of aid fell to its lowest since January 2009.
The drop probably reflected people exhausting unemployment benefits rather than a pick-up in hiring. There were 5.9 million people receiving extended benefits under special programs at the beginning of January.
Their name was Sean, though their last name is currently unknown. Until their death Sunday, Sean lived in a tent outside the Union Rescue Mission in Los Angeles' Skid Row. Sean's neighbors nicknamed them “Africa” in honor of their homeland of Cameroon. They told a nearby resident that he'd been living in the area for four or five months after leaving a nearby mental institution, though another resident claimed they were there for 12. A little over one day has passed since Sean's death and many of the critical details about their life are difficult to verify. The LAPD has yet to release Sean's last name, for instance. They aren't confirming their first name, either. Government-issued ID cards are relatively uncommon among the homeless; the only way journalists learned Sean's exact age of 39 was from the city coroner's report.
A rain-soaked protest was held in Pershing Square the night of Sean's death but if there was a protest in downtown Los Angeles on Monday, I could not find it. A march to LAPD HQ was scheduled for Tuesday.
A little after 8 PM Monday night, two ambulances were parked next to the site of Sean's demise, but they were there for a fresh injury. One of the ambulance drivers blipped the siren as they pulled from the curb, and a man across San Pedro St. threw up their hands and yelled, "I didn't do it!" The tension among Skid Row residents shows no sign of subsiding.
What is known about Sean is that their life ended around noontime Sunday courtesy of five gunshots leaving four bullet wounds delivered by three LAPD officers. Sean's death was captured on at least two cellphone videos and one security camera outside the Union Rescue Mission. All three videos have been posted online, the most popular of which was viewed over a million times before being removed from Facebook for its graphic content.
Of the three videos, the most comprehensive happens to be the one with the least emotion. Though the Union Rescue Mission's security camera footage lacks audio, it shows the altercation from a higher angle and for greater length than either of the two smartphone recordings. Four LAPD officers are visible from the beginning, grouped around the zippered doorway to Sean's tent, attempting to extricate him.
Like many incidents of brief intensity, the prologue takes far longer than the actual event. The four officers stand around waiting for Sean for over a minute. We see the tent rustle as Sean moves inside. One of the officers shuffles around, hands on their hips. Backup arrives next—a fifth officer joins the group. A cyclist intends to bypass the scene, slows down, and begins to walk their bike. Out of a Parisian-style public toilet next to the tent, a man in a red sweater exits, looks to their left, notices the standoff, and continues walking away, zipping up their pants. The sixth officer joins. At this point, the video indicates over a minute and a half have passed since the beginning of the incident.
An internal LAPD investigation into the shooting has yet to reveal why the officers were called to the scene. One report claimed they were responding to calls of a robbery. The Union Rescue Mission's executive director, Andy Bales, indicated that an argument between Sean and the resident in the next tent escalated into a fistfight, which prompted the 911 call, though Bales stopped short of stating that call came from their organization. Other reports mentioned that Sean was living with an untreated mental illness. What's clear is that when officers arrived on the 500 block of San Pedro at 11:36 a.m., Sean's tent was in violation of a 2007 compromise between the LAPD and the ACLU, giving the homeless the right to sleep on L.A.'s public streets between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. On-duty officers have a right to enforce this ordinance, though the security camera footage does show at least one other tent across the street.
The footage continues; the situation escalates. The man in the red sweater turns around to watch one officer dive headfirst into the tent. The two the nearest officers bend down to assess the situation and draw their weapons. At least one onlooker has started recording video. By the two-minute mark, the zippered door has been opened and two officers have collapsed the rest of the tent around Sean, who still refuses to leave. They break free, spinning their way out of a handhold, flailing their arms and aiming toward the adjacent alleyway. Within seconds, Sean is subdued and lying on the ground. Out of nowhere, a woman in a gray hoodie runs toward the scene and picks up a loose nightstick dropped by one of the officers.  They are tackled by another officer and immediately handcuffed.
For a few more agonizing seconds, the incident drags on. Then, around the 2 minute 40 mark, the onlookers suddenly recoil and run for cover. One of the men recording cellphone video runs off-screen. Another man lies prone on the sidewalk.
What the closed-circuit video failed to capture was any audio of the incident. The sickening click of a Taser delivering electricity. The first gunshot, followed quickly by four more. And most critically, the voices of the men involved. After reviewing the incident footage himself, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said, “You can hear the young officer who is primarily engaged in the confrontation saying that, ‘He has my gun. They have my gun.' And they say it several times.”
Naturally, others find the on-duty probationary officer's language more difficult to decipher. But Chief Beck is drawing from different information than the general public—two of the officers involved in the shooting were wearing body cameras as part of the city's pilot program to outfit every officer on the LAPD. Anonymous sources are already saying that the imagery from the body cameras is inconclusive, though the audio is likely better, as it is closer to the source. The plan to purchase 7,000 cameras was announced by Mayor Eric Garcetti in December 2014, though only a fraction of officers has been equipped since then. The policy on releasing these videos to the public is undetermined and the police will have to move fast if they want to stave off trial by YouTube.
Ethan Miller via Getty Images 'The Sarah Silverman Program' writer Harris Wittels and comedian Sarah Silverman arrive at Comedy Central's Emmy Awards party at the STK restaurant September 21, 2008 in Los Angeles, California
Harris Lee Wittels died on February 19, 2015 of a heroin overdose alone in their Los Angeles home. They were 30 years young.
They were my son. They were the world's comedian. My son grew up in an affluent, white suburban neighborhood. They were a “nice Jewish boy.” Their dad is a physician and I am a retired teacher. My son would never, ever take that drug called heroin! These kinds of kids don't do such a thing! I am sharing this story because I want other families to hopefully know what we did not know.
Harris accomplished more in their 30 years than most can accomplish in a lifetime. At their Bar Mitzvah speech, the Rabbi stood up and said to watch out for this kid. They would be at the Laff Stop one day. At just 18, they won third place in Houston's funniest comedian contest at the Laff Stop! They attended the Houston High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and graduated from Emerson College with a degree in TV/ Video production.
At 22, they were discovered by Sarah Silverman in a club, doing standup. They asked for them to submit some of their writing to them for their upcoming TV series on Comedy Central. The rest is history. They climbed the ladder of success quickly.
They wrote many Hollywood scripts. They invented the word “humblebrag” that now resides in the Oxford Dictionary and authored a book about it, Humblebrag, the Art of False Modesty. On the book jacket they wrote: “Humblebrag, the Art of False Modesty, by Harris Wittels, who would love some free time but has been too busy writing for ‘Parks and Recreation,' ‘Eastbound & Down,' and a bunch of other stuff!”
They performed standup with Louis C.K., Aziz Ansari and Sarah Silverman. They died as co-executive producer of the acclaimed television series, “Parks and Recreation” and was seen on the show occasionally as the animal control guy.
“All Harris ever longed to do was make people laugh. However, on the inside, they were not laughing.”
They were the go-to joke guy. Aziz said that Harris was the comedian's comedian. They even wrote a joke for President Obama.
They loved leftovers and McDonald's as much as they loved gourmet restaurants. They worshiped the jam band Phish. They began attending their concerts at age 15 and saw well over 300 concerts. When Sarah Silverman hired him, they informed them that part of their contract would have to include time off for these concerts. They told them it was their religion! Who does that?!
They did many hilarious podcasts with Scott Aukerman of “Comedy Bang Bang” fame and they did one very serious podcast with Pete Holmes in 2014 about their heroin addiction. It is well worth a listen about the reality of chasing heroin. They were also a drummer in the band, “Don't Stop or We'll Die.” Their last project was writing for and co-producing the Netflix series “Master of None” and they were going to star in it as Aziz Ansari's best friend but they died instead. The show was up for four Emmys and it won in one category.
All Harris ever longed to do was make people laugh. However, on the inside, they were not laughing. They admitted to doing recreational drugs since 12 years of age. How could we not know?! We did not bury our heads and we were not stupid people. We were great parents. They would tell you that themselves as they told therapist after therapist. We were very involved in their life. They made straight As, had tons of friends, and was very driven and straightforward about what they wanted to do with their life. They were a total self-starter. We never had to beg them to do their homework. They got a scholarship to college.
Once they tried cocaine in high school and stayed home from school for three days because it made them so sick. They swore from that time on that they were never going to be a drug user. During the last few years of their life, we would visit them in Los Angeles and they always acted like we were intruding. We finally decided not to visit and we attributed this to their hectic life they lived in Hollywood land. They came home for fewer and fewer holidays and special occasions and, if truth be told, I saw the light literally go out of their eyes and suspected nothing. Why? Because they were busy being so successful! Harris had become a very successful high-functioning drug addict.
I knew they were seeing a therapist and was happy about it. They finally told their sister three days before their wedding and two years before their death that they were hooked on OxyContin but their therapist was going to help them get off. They forbid them to tell us about it. They were their best friend and they were their biggest confidante. The drug was stealing their brain. The old Harris (free of opioids) who adored their sister would never have chosen to place sadness on one of the happiest days of their life. When their daughter was born a year later, Harris decided to enter rehab and they had to tell us what was going on. They entered a very cushy rehab for a month in Malibu and began to have some very meaningful interactions with us again.
Once they got out, we were thinking that was the end of that nonsense. Six months later, I was with their sister who received a text from Harris, which said, “I am headed to Oregon to Hazelden because I am addicted to heroin.” I saw their face turn ashen and they showed me the text. I fell on the floor in a fetal position and wailed. When I finally stopped, I called them and they said, “Mom, I caught this in time. I am nipping it in the bud. Stop worrying so much.”
“I saw the light literally go out of their eyes and suspected nothing. Why? Because ... Harris had become a very successful high-functioning drug addict.”
I decided to visit them for family week. They were there for a month. I was so annoyed at the end of my week there because I was only allowed to see them for one hour a day, and the very last day, I was allowed a 10-minute session with them and their therapist. I felt like I had so much more to say to them and so much more to learn about how their treatment should progress after their release.
They entered one more rehab two months after leaving Hazelden and then their sober living home. It would have been nice to know that they had checked themselves out a week early. They died during that week. Perhaps I could have stayed more in touch with him, given that information, and their outcome might have been different. There is a serious disconnect that exists between the families and the rehabs.
I received an email from Harris the night before they died. They were speaking about the finale of “Parks and Recreation” and their future life in Manhattan. It said:
harris wittels Feb 19 There's only one more episode left and its the big farewell episode that will make you cry. i found a cool place to live in Manhattan. I feel good!! I am feeling very fortunate. Love you
I was flying high from that connection with him. They worked so hard to land the part in “Master of None” and I hadn't heard that kind of excitement in their voice for a very long time. I was totally convinced that they were finally getting their life on track.
My world fell apart the next day as TMZ got hold of the story of their death and leaked it to the world. I found out in a text from a friend after the world found out! I was in total shock. As their mom, I really believed this time was different. We never lose hope. It will never make sense to me. I adored my son and wish I could have found some way to make that love heal him. I did all I could with the tools that I had at the time. They would never have chosen to leave this devastation behind. I lost half of my future: my daughter-in-law, my grandchildren, and the carrying on of the Wittels name for many generations to come.
I firmly believe that the current model of treatment is not working. Overdose deaths are the number one cause of accidental death in the United States. It is officially an epidemic. In addition to starting the first Houston, Texas support chapter of GRASP (Grief Recovery After a Substance Passing), I have made it my business to learn as much as possible about addiction and advocate for changes. Here is what I wish I had known before I lost my precious son:
1. Our current drug laws must change, and the way we treat this epidemic must change.
First and foremost, substance misuse must be treated as and called a health issue. Why can some people pick up that first drink or smoke that first joint and then put them down with no addiction issues? Some of us have addictive personalities and can't put them down. I personally feel like it takes a minimum of six months to rewire the brain from the physical effects of opioid use but insurance is very expensive and most only allow for a thirty day stay and then these people are expected to leave and attend meetings and be good and sober from then on.
2. Medically assisted treatment (MAT) using Methadone, Buprenorphine, Vivitrol, or Suboxone should all be offered as a means of maintenance.
If people need to be on maintenance drugs for a lifetime, then so be it! It's about treating the individual so that they may live and function as close to normal as possible. In some cases, it might just be about buying some time until they can figure it out. At some point they may finally have the desire to totally quit and get treatment without maintenance drugs. The stigma associated with addiction must be obliterated. People who struggle with addiction should be able to ask for help without feeling afraid or embarrassed. When they do ask for help, their loved ones must get involved and help them find the best method of treatment.
3. There must be total availability of Naloxone, the drug that reverses an overdose if given in time.
It should be available to people who use drugs and their families and friends, and to every first responder. 911 should be called without fear of consequences with the law if someone is with someone who has overdosed. Good Samaritan laws should be instated everywhere.
4. We need safe syringe access programs and injection sites.
Overdoses can be controlled if people can use in a safe environment, when other methods fail.
5. Doctors writing prescriptions for opioids must be better regulated.
Many addictions start there and they move on to heroin as it is cheaper and easier to get, and problems occur because street drugs can be laced with too many unknowns.
6. Rehabs must be better regulated.
They need to be up to date with the most current trends for treatment – not just relying on the 12 steps to fix the problem.
7. Relapses occur frequently right after leaving rehabs.
The families rely on what the professionals are telling them and people who struggle with addiction often lie. Each person must be treated on an individual basis and families must be better informed of what kind of treatment might be necessary. Outpatient care and follow-ups are crucial. AA and Nar-Anon should be offered as part of the whole process, and people need to be offered safe medical options as well if that is not working for them.
8. People who struggle with addiction should not be treated as criminals.
Drug charges for getting caught with a small amount that is obviously not for resale are too harsh. We need drug courts that put these people into beneficial treatment instead of jail. Hospitals need to have a way in place to send these people into treatment. When an addict is open to treatment, it must be made available immediately.
9. The drug epidemic has spread to middle and high schools and into all walks of society.
There must be more truthful information about drugs and treatment offered in every school. Family members who have lost their loved ones to overdoses need to tell their stories to these kids whenever possible. I have beat the pavement in Houston, trying to do just that with very little success. I wish my son had heard a parent tell this story to them when they were twelve and started using recreational drugs!
“[Heroin] stole our son, brother, uncle, friend, writer, comedian, actor and drummer. It stole too many pieces of our hearts.”
Harris worked very hard to achieve their dreams. They fought valiantly to beat their demons. When they died, we received so many testimonials of just how kind they were to everyone no matter who they were. One of their most famous Harris-isms was, “Let's stop burning the witch of the week. We are all wonderful and horrible and figuring it out.” They gave everyone the benefit of the doubt. Something else they would say was, “Stop future-tripping. All we have is today.”
I have become a warrior mom, trying to live a new life without my hero in it and trying to make some sense out of their death by attempting to save others from this nightmare. All I have is today, and I am trying really hard to make it count, for him.
They had so much more love, laughter and talent left to give this world, but heroin took their life. It won. It stole our son, brother, uncle, friend, writer, comedian, actor and drummer. It stole too many pieces of our hearts.
A few months before their death, they said something on a podcast that is worth sharing:
Hey, it's Harris callin' from heaven. Ahh it's pretty great up here. Ahh it's beautiful for starters. Hitler's up here, however, for the vegetarianism thing so callin' bullshit on that. But other than that it's pretty cloudy. You sit on them so that's cool. Oops gotta' go, ice cream buffet!
So how's that ice cream, son?

BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) — The Latest on a reported explosion at a Minnesota mosque (all times local):
5:50 p.m.
An FBI official says investigators are looking for suspects after an explosive device detonated at a mosque in suburban Minneapolis.
Witnesses reported seeing something get thrown at the imam's office window from a vehicle just before the blast Saturday morning at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington.
Police say there were no injuries, but the explosion damaged a room in the mosque.
Richard Thornton is the special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis Division. They say investigators have recovered components of the device to figure how it was put together.
The mosque primarily serves people from the area's large Somali community.

3:30 p.m.
A Muslim civil rights group is offering a $10,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the bombing of a suburban Minneapolis mosque.
The reward is being offered by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR. It comes after a different group earlier said it was also offering a $10,000 reward.
The blast occurred around 5 a.m. Saturday at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington. Police say there were no injuries. The FBI is leading an investigation into the explosion.
CAIR's local chapter says its national office is urging Islamic centers and mosques to step up security.
The organization's civil rights director says the group hopes the reward will help authorities quickly apprehend the perpetrator of the "act of violence."
___
1:50 p.m.
Authorities say a preliminary investigation shows that an illegal destructive device caused an explosion at a suburban Minneapolis mosque.
The blast happened at around 5 a.m. Saturday at the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington. The police department tweeted that the FBI field office in Minneapolis is now the lead agency investigating the explosion. An FBI spokesperson didn't immediately reply to a phone message seeking comment.

With the 519-stall South Bellevue Park and Ride shutting down as early as next month, the Mercer Island City Council requested that Sound Transit give a presentation about its plan to mitigate traffic impacts from the closure.
A light rail station, 1,500-stall parking garage and rail guideway will be constructed at the South Bellevue site, with a planned opening in 2023 to coincide with the start of East Link light rail service. South Bellevue will also serve as a staging zone during construction.
In the meantime, Sound Transit has to figure out where Bellevue commuters will park. Paul Cornish, light rail development manager, said that Sound Transit was able to lease about 350 total stalls from seven churches in Renton and Bellevue. A “one-to-one replacement” with the 519 lost stalls was not required, they said, though that was the goal. The agency also identified 850 available spaces at existing park and rides.
However, as Councilmember Dan Grausz pointed out, none of those lots fall along the 550 bus route, which Cornish said is the most popular one that runs through South Bellevue. Where the 550 does stop, and frequently, is Mercer Island.
Grausz said that it is “not only a possibility, but a high risk probability” that 550 riders will park at the Mercer Island Park and Ride, and asked if Sound Transit had a contingency plan for that scenario. Cornish said that Sound Transit had scoped out some locations along the 550 route in Bellevue and contacted churches and private businesses, but “none of that came to fruition.”
Grausz predicted that many people who usually use the 447-stall Mercer Island Park and Ride will be displaced. They noted that the garage is usually filled by 7:30 a.m., and with at least 50 percent “off-Islanders.” They suggested that Sound Transit have some sort of back-up plan, even a temporary solution, so that it doesn't displace its customers on the Island and “leave 100 to 150 people stranded.”
Many community members want Sound Transit to build more commuter parking in Mercer Island. Mayor Bruce Bassett said that won't solve the problem, as additional spaces are more likely to be filled by other Eastside commuters than Island residents. What the city needs is Mercer Island-only parking, which will also be useful when light rail service begins.
Cornish said that all park and rides operate on a first come, first served basis, but said that Sound Transit could do license plate studies and other monitoring to see if its parking plan is working or if it needs to “step up its game” on the Eastside.
Residents who addressed the council after Sound Transit's presentation said it was “half-hearted” and even “insulting,” that Sound Transit was “not as creative as they could have been” and that it “doesn't sound like anyone prioritizes Mercer Island,” imploring the council to stand up for their interests.
Sound Transit had committed about $6 million to build about 200 stalls of parking in a green area near the Mercer Island Community and Event Center that would be used by South Bellevue commuters during the closure, then revert to Mercer Island, but residents opposed that location. The agency then decided that it would seek parking alternatives east of the East Channel bridge. Cornish said that when Sound Transit was developing its plan for South Bellevue, it intentionally did not look for parking in Mercer Island.
East Link is in “various stages” of construction at the moment, Cornish said. Sound Transit recently broke ground in Bellevue, starting work on the downtown tunnel.
It is planning to start work on Interstate 90 in 2017, closing down the center roadway in July when HOV lanes in the outer roadways open.
Cornish also noted that Bellevue Way Southeast will be narrowed to three lanes, with a reversible lane in the middle.
The 550 will continue to run its current route on Bellevue Way throughout construction, along with ST Express buses 555 and 556, and Metro buses 241 and 249.
For other mitigation measures, Sound Transit added 12 trips a day to the 554 bus route (six each way, with East Link paying for eight of the trips), but did not lease any extra stalls in Issaquah or Sammamish.
It also plans to create awareness of existing travel programs like VanPool, RideShare, emergency ride home credits, bicycle and pedestrian options and other awards and incentives programs.
Mercer Island was initially part of a permit program that Sound Transit is implementing at nine parks and rides to encourage carpools. City Manager Pam Bissonette said that the city requested to be taken out of that program, as it would take up commuter parking spaces and wouldn't grant priority to Island residents.
Cornish said that Sound Transit will continue to work on community outreach, and give a two-month warning before closing the South Bellevue Park and Ride. They said that the contractor may not start work until the “things warm up and dry out.”

MacIver News Service | October 1, 2012
[Madison, Wisc…] At least 30 Wisconsin municipalities failed to send absentee ballots to military voters before the 45 day deadline, according to former U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony Principi, and he's demanding the Government Accountability Board address the problem immediately.
As reported by the website WisPolitics.com, Principi sent a letter to the GAB on Monday pointing out the failure to meet the 45 day deadline is in violation of Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act.
“This violation is particularly unsettling in light of the fact that, only six months ago, a federal court entered a consent decree against Wisconsin and the Government Accountability Board for similar violations of military voting rights,” wrote Principi.
Principi cited a study by the Military Postal Service Agency, which found less than 45 days is not enough time to ensure service members can receive, complete and return in time.
“Your office's violations therefore may deprive service members of their fundamental right to vote,” they wrote.
This comes on top of a report by the MacIver News Service that the Federal Voter Assistance Program was providing Wisconsin service members the incorrect deadline for when their ballots must be received by for the general election.
The Department of Defense is scrambling to undo any damage caused when the Federal Voting Assistance Program provided the wrong absentee ballot deadline to Wisconsin service members.
Also in Washington, DC, House Administration Chairman Dan Lungren, (R-Calif.) took action to ensure that the voting rights of military and overseas voters are protected, including sending a staff attorney to meet with state election officials here.
“It's alarming to know that an untold number of our men and women in uniform were provided incorrect information,” said Lungren. “This is an unacceptable error that cannot continue. Whether it's from the battle field or at the ballot box, our men and women in uniform deserve to have their vote counted.”
Principi also sent their letter to Nelson Hermilla, U.S Department of Justice Chief Civil Rights Division, and J.B. Van Hollen, Wisconsin Attorney General.
Principi was U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs under President George W. Bush from 2001-2005. They now serves as National Chair, Veterans and Military Families for Romney Coalition.
MNS will have more on this story on Tuesday.
NBC News is using the November 14 Rancho Tehama school shooting to whip up fear about guns that are already illegal in the state of California.
Their report revolves around “ghost guns,” which they present as something that can be purchased and assembled in just “a couple of hours.” Their report omits the hours of milling required to complete a lower frame before assembly can happen and, more importantly, they completely omit that gun laws in California require that any homemade gun be affixed with a serial number and entered into the state's gun registry (like any other gun).
Yes, they mention that Rancho Tehama gunman Kevin Neal's long guns are already banned by the “assault weapons” law in the state of California, but this admission is sandwiched between descriptions of rifles “with multi-round magazines” and intimations that “ghost gun” legislation needs to be taken up at the federal level. They point to the “loophole on so-called ‘ghost guns'” and assure readers that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D- New York) wants to take action.
They report how easily one can acquire a kit to build on an 80 percent frame and attempt to show how dangerous “ghost guns” are by citing two instances of their use, one in Baltimore in 2016 and the alleged used of such guns in the Rancho Tehama attack. In other words, they provide details on two criminal uses of such guns as grounds for preventing law-abiding citizens from owning them.
But their report does not mention that California bars guns on K-12 campuses, even by law-abiding teachers with concealed carry permits. That law was completely ignored by Kevin Neal, as were laws against murder.
Moreover, NBC News does not actually know if Neal's alleged “ghost guns” had serial numbers on them or not, so they leave the door open in the event that Neal's guns were registered after all. But worrying about what is legal and illegal is not nearly as important as pushing gun control, which is what the NBC News report is really about.

An on-the-run sex offender who could be living in Leeds as a man or a woman will feature on BBC's Crimewatch tonight.
Lisa Hauxwell was convicted of a number of sexual assaults last year and was sentenced in their absence to 14 years in prison.
The TV appeal comes after Hauxwell spent several months on the run, having been sentenced at Durham Crown Court in November.
The string of sex assaults took place in the Newton Aycliffe area in 2001 and 2002. Hauxwell, who was born in Darlington and still has links to the town had been charged with the offences in 2015 under the name Craig John Hauxwell.
Police say the 48-year-old could possibly still be living as a man. Them last known address was in Leeds but there has been no record of them at that property for many months.
Despite extensive enquiries since then police have been unable to trace Hauxwell so they can begin serving their sentence.
Tonight's Crimewatch programme, on BBC1 at 9pm, will feature photos of Hauxwell as both male and female in its ‘Wanted Faces' segment, in a bid to bring them to justice.
Hauxwell speaks with a stutter and when last seen on CCTV footage in the West Yorkshire area, last year, they had bleached blonde, shoulder length hair.
“We have carried out exhaustive enquiries to trace Lisa Hauxwell and these are continuing,” said Det Insp Yvonne Dutson.
“There has been no activity on their bank account for several months, no record of any dealings with agencies such as the DWP or HMRC and no confirmed sightings of them since they were recorded on a security camera at a petrol station in Dronfield, Derbyshire in April 2016.
“Hauxwell was convicted of two rapes and seven indecent assaults, which were truly horrendous crimes.
"We hope the appeal on Crimewatch will bring new information which ultimately will result in them being locked up and sent to prison to begin their sentence.” A
n incident room – tel 0191 375 2550 - will be staffed during the programme. After tonight, calls relating to Lisa Hauxwell's whereabouts can be reported to police on the usual non-emergency number, 101.

EAST LANSING, Mich. — Does your insurance cover amusement park visits? Maybe it should.
For years, David Wartinger's patients told them stories of passing kidneys shortly after riding roller coasters .
"Most urologists wouldn't be surprised by this," said Wartinger, a professor emeritus within Michigan State University's Department of Osteopathic Surgical Specialties. Jarring motions and vibrations often jostle stones stuck on the outer area of kidney, enabling them to be passed.
But one patient's story prompted Wartinger to look at roller coasters more seriously. The patient told Wartinger they rode Big Thunder Mountain Railroad inside Disney World's Magic Kingdom three times in an hour and passed a stone shortly after each ride.
So Wartinger decided to test it himself. Alongside then-urology resident Mark Mitchell, Wartinger visited Disney in 2008.
They and Mitchell rode coasters with a backpack loaded with a 3D model of a kidney between them. Testing nearly 200 stones of different shapes and sizes, the pair found Big Thunder Mountain was particularly effective.

They found nearly 70% of stones were primed for passage when riding in the rear car at Big Thunder Mountain. Other carts on the ride weren't nearly as successful. The pair also tested Space Mountain and Aerosmith's Rock 'n' Roller Coaster, which failed to replicate Big Thunder Mountain's success.
Rough-riding coasters with quick turns are most likely to help stones move along, Wartinger said. Anyone looking to try Wartinger's method should avoid coasters with inverted loops or upside-down movement.
The potential cost savings for patients, employers and insurance companies are substantial, Wartinger said.
"We want to offer people something cheaper than a $5,000 Lithotripsy," they said, a procedure which breaks up large stones using ultrasound shock waves.
Coasters like Big Thunder Mountain won't work for everyone, Wartinger said. Much like a person's fingerprint, the inside of a person's kidney has a unique pattern. But for patients who know they have a small stone, recently had a larger stone broken-up or women looking to pass a stone before becoming pregnant, roller coasters are a logical proactive measure.
"I can tell you, if insurance companies want to save money, they'd cover visits to amusement parks," they said.

Contrary to some recent media reports, the closure of Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack had nothing to do with lack of support from Gordon Ramsay. I've never said anything about Gordon. I'm not stupid. I wouldn't be where I am without their Kitchen Nightmares programme. I've become a household name all over the world. I had an email from Beijing the other day.
It was the economic climate that did for the restaurant. We went into administration two years ago because things were tight. Then my daughter bought the company and was running it under licence. But just as we were starting to see things pick up, the recession hit hard. People just stopped coming during the week (although we were still very busy at the weekends).
After Kitchen Nightmares, we were incredibly popular. I was turning away 80 people a day. It got to the stage where even the waiting list was too long. With the benefit of hindsight we shouldn't have moved to bigger premises. But Gordon made the same mistake as me. He's expanded too big and too quickly and it hasn't worked. Yes, it's on a totally different scale but it's the same principle. Did Gordon call me when the restaurant closed? No, they didn't.
You have to take Kitchen Nightmares for what it is. But if you go on a programme like that, be sure to go on a business course as well, or at least bring someone on board who understands business, because you can have the best food in the world but if you don't have enough customers coming through your doors or if you don't understand the nature of VAT or PAYE, you will struggle. They were just initials to me but they're the things that can shut you down.
It's been a really tough time for me and for everyone. Love's, another Brighton restaurant that was on the show, has also closed. Even Gordon's had a few problems. But I haven't given up. I'm selling my food at farmers' markets and catering at a Brighton club night, Soul Survivors. And I'm writing my second cookbook along with trying to sell my range of sauces into supermarkets. American soul food is still here. I'm still here. Watch this space.
In the wake of the announcement of the FIA WEC's new for 2014 ‘Second Screen' App we had an opportunity during and after the Press Conference to ask questions of both Pierre Fillon (the App is an ACO initiative) and Gerard Neveu.
Q&As (all answers Gerard Neveu unless otherwise noted)
Will a full archive of race video be available on the website, or via the app?
Gerard Neveu: “Not the full race coverage no, the app will give access, with a week's delay, to 52 minute highlights packages of every race.”
What about multiple devices – is the price a one-shot device or multiple devices?
“It will be for up to five devices on the same platform.”
What about wifi capability at circuits, this will require a very good level of bandwidth to support large numbers of users at a track?
Pierre Fillon: “Whilst we are working on improving wi fi capability at the track the app is really for people who are not at the track.”
Gerard Neveu: “It is a very good question, it is a big concern for us. There is a big variation between the tracks, some are good with coverage, others, for example in Brazil, there is a worse situation. It is, for sure the start of a new adventure and the technology is ready for that. But it is impossible to think that for example at Le Mans you could provide the wifi capacity for 200,000 people.”
“The ACO is working very hard to build in more facilities and more capacity but the reality is that it will never be enough. Try for example to send a picture from your mobile phone at half time at the Stade de France and find out if you can!”
“We really believe that this app can help the people who stay in the paddock, for example, because there is always more capacity there than in the some of the fan areas.”
“However if you are somewhere else other than at the event you will have access as if you were there – that is exactly the target of the app.”
“We also know that the specifics of endurance racing, the regulations, the different classes, and the actual length of the races makes it impossible to fully understand if you just watch the TV. To find a broadcaster that will agree to a proposal to broadcast live a full race of 6 hours is unusual.”
“The App is therefore a compliment to the full TV coverage, to give fans the depth of information that they need to get the best out of the event.”
You have said that the aim of the app is to get more visibility for the Series, more access for the fans. Last year fans could watch the video streaming free, could get access to live timing free. Do you think it is a good idea in terms of raising visibility to suddenly take away the free access and now selling it to the fans?
“It is a good question but I would just ask for your patience. I don't think you will be asking the same question on Sunday because you can't really compare what you had last year to what we are offering this year. It is like the difference between a golf cart and a sports car.”
“We had a lot of requests for more detail, more depth and that is what this provides. More news, more highlights, more access to the cameras. Last year you had a simple option to watch live streaming of the race. Here you have a lot of options as to how you choose to do that.”
“The problem is that when you do that it is not permitted to offer a service free of charges you have to make a choice, a strategic choice.”
“The first presentation to Apple saw them say they were very impressed, that this was the most beautiful motorsports app that they had seen, but that they were surprised that we were offering it for such a low cost. They have a good experience of the market and said they were 100% sure that we could push.”
“We told them though that this was not our business strategy, that we wanted to increase visibility, that we did not want to make any profit on the revenue from the download. We have another plan for that.”
“We wanted to keep the price accessible for a large majority of the fans. If you take a full package including Le Mans we believe that this is a very reasonable price at €30. In France, at a movie theatre, that price will get myself and my two kids in for one movie. Our service gives you the whole season for that, including the premium event at Le Mans. How much does it cost for Moto GP, Formula One or WTCC for the whole season – Have a look and benchmark and you will see!”
Is there a commentary available on the app?
“Yes to commentary – It is a voice you know very well, John Hindhaugh will be the voice for the whole races. They have a very good knowledge and as we explained earlier there is complexity to the formula and it as very important to the ACO that we have someone to explain correctly the endurance.”
“I am not saying that's not the case on TV coverage but here you can be sure that you have a good commentary with someone who knows very well Endurance, the WEC and Le Mans.”
If you log in online, can you use the same account on other devices?
“No, there are three markets, one online, Android and IOS, there is no cut across.”
“It is complex. I asked for an opportunity to buy 200 apps because we wished to offer the opportunity to you the media, and to others, to get the app to experience it. That is not possible because Apple say that it is only the owner of the iPad that can buy it across available platforms? ”
How big a team is working on this app?
“We have three teams currently working on the project – a 6-person development team which will, of course, begin to wind down.”
“There is a 4-person team from WEC helping the development team to bring them all of the knowledge they need of the WEC and endurance racing.”
“Then we have a 6-person team dealing with content including a cameraman, reporters etc.”
“Then we have the opportunity to work too with the existing TV crew, with the Director here who looks after our TV output and ensures that the variety and quality of the pictures is at the maximum possible.”
How many languages will be available?
“Text will start in both French and English to start, commentary will be English from the beginning.”
“From there we will see where people download the app from and that will help us to determine where the highest demand for other language services exists.”
“Early signs are that there are already a lot of downloads but the data we need to decide on developments will be coming along very soon. If we discover, for example that 10,000 people from Japan have downloaded then it would be a good situation for us to decide whether or not to do something in Japanese.”
The Sportscar Audience is one that has become used to interactivity. This is an impressive but complicated App – what reassurance can you give about a feedback mechanism for the inevitable comments and teething troubles?
“Social media, there is a feedback button on the app itself – There is a special team dedicated to responding to those enquiries, in particular in the early days.”
“We are very aware that the fans will have comments and opinions. We know that many of those points will be that they would prefer this was free, but with respect that is not the question at this point.”
“We want as many people as possible to download the app fro free, and for many of them to use the premium service too because we believe it will add enormously to their ability to enjoy the race.”
“We want to get some feedback too from you, the media, and from the competitors too as to how you find the app is working.”
Will there be a Paypal payment option (some have complained that there are financial penalties from some markets without this).
“Not yet it will depend on the level of demand for the paid service.”
The key here is surely to determine what this is designed to do, and what it isn't designed to do?
“Absolutely – there is no doubt that this is principally being promoted as an opportunity for those not at the track to develop more understanding of what is going on on track. This is an absolutely essential part of adding the additional level of information that we need to complement the existing TV coverage, to get people more depth of access and understanding.”
What does success look like?
I will be sad if we don't have some dozens of thousands in the next couple of weeks having downloaded the app and by the end of the year I would like to see around 200,000 – If we can manage that it marks a very significant uplift on what we were getting through the website last season. It's about building an audience, not just building the knowledge of our current audience but finding a new one.”
The WEC Twitter feed announced in February that live streaming would be free? (answer requested via FIA WEC PR)
“That was an error, which we are obviously very sorry about, and was issued without knowledge of the restrictions which exist over offering free versions of content that sits within a paid for app.”
The rotation is one of the key areas of need for Boston this offseason.
BOSTON -- Starting on Tuesday, the Red Sox can negotiate with free agents on other teams. And that could include a pitcher the Red Sox are extremely familiar with in lefty Jon Lester, the man they traded to the Oakland Athletics for Yoenis Cespedes back in July.
BOSTON -- Starting on Tuesday, the Red Sox can negotiate with free agents on other teams. And that could include a pitcher the Red Sox are extremely familiar with in lefty Jon Lester, the man they traded to the Oakland Athletics for Yoenis Cespedes back in July.
The rotation is one of the key areas of need for Boston this offseason.
"Again, we're going to try to build the best team we can, and that is one of the areas we need to add to, the rotation," general manager Ben Cherington said on Thursday. "We know them well and hope we get a chance to talk to him. I'm sure he'll talk to others and I'm sure we'll talk to others. We just have to get into the offseason and see what comes of it."
Despite the trade, the Red Sox and Lester parted on good terms, keeping at least some hopes alive for a reunion.
"The relationship is in place that will allow for a conversation, and from there, we'll see," said Cherington. "He'll have options; we will, too. And we look forward to having a constructive conversation at some point."
The 2014 season was one of the best in Lester's career, as they went 16-11 with a 2.46 ERA in 32 starts.
I was pairing with Zi at work today, and we hit onto an interesting problem.
The Problem
We were working on a Spree application, which is a really nice Rails engine/gem e-commerce platform. Out of the box, it contains a bunch of factories. Here's the default user_factory.rb in Spree:
FactoryGirl . define do sequence :user_authentication_token do | n | "xxxx #{ Time . now . to_i }#{ rand ( 1000 ) }#{ n } xxxxxxxxxxxxx" end factory :user , class: Spree . user_class do email { generate ( :random_email ) } login { email } password 'secret' password_confirmation { password } authentication_token { generate ( :user_authentication_token ) } if Spree . user_class . attribute_method? :authentication_token factory :admin_user do spree_roles { [ Spree :: Role . find_by ( name: 'admin' ) || create ( :role , name: 'admin' )] } end factory :user_with_addreses do ship_address bill_address end end end
Now, our Rails application which uses Spree has an extra attribute username . We could have use traits, and create a new factory like :user_with_username . The tiny problem with that is the original :user factory is used EVERYWHERE.
One terrifying solution would have been to crack open the Spree gem and make the modification there. My suggestion was quickly dismissed.
We tried something like this:
FactoryGirl . define do sequence :user_name do | n | "user_name_{rand(1000)} #{ n } " end factory :user , class: Spree . user_class do user_name { generate ( :user_name ) } end end
Unfortunately, this only throws a DuplicateDefinitionError: :user already registered: user exception.
We tried unregistering a factory, especially since there's a Factory.register , but again no luck. We tried deleting a factory, and we were left depressed.
The Solution
The solution wasn't complicated. Finding it on Google and StackOverflow was. This explains the post's title.
There are essentially 2 steps to this solution.
Step 1: Make sure Spree's factories are loaded first.
In spec_helper.rb , you need to add require 'spree/testing_support/factories in order to use Spree's built-in factories. Make sure this is included before the your custom factories.
That's because you are going to modify Spree's factories, so you need to make sure that the Spree one gets loaded first.
Step 2: Modify the Factory
I never knew Factory.modify existed:
Factory . define do sequence :user_name do | n | "user_name_{rand(1000)} #{ n } " end end Factory . modify do factory :user do user_name { generate ( :user_name ) } end end
Note that the sequence :user_name has to go into it's own Factory.define block. Therefore, this doesn't work:
Factory . modify do sequence :user_name do | n | "user_name_{rand(1000)} #{ n } " end factory :user do user_name { generate ( :user_name ) } end end
That's it!
We saw green again, and prevented anyone of us from getting bald. Hope this saves someone a couple of hours work.

A study led by researchers from the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Pitt Department of Psychology has identified a possible link between adolescent sleep habits and early substance abuse. The study, published today in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, found that both sleep duration and sleep quality during late childhood predict alcohol and cannabis use later in adolescence.
“Treating problems with drugs and alcohol once they exist and preventing them can be challenging, and we are always looking for modifiable risk factors,” said Brant P. Hasler, Ph.D., assistant professor of psychiatry and psychology, and lead author of the study. “Doing what we can to ensure sufficient sleep duration and improve sleep quality during late childhood may have benefits in terms of reducing the use of these substances later in life.”
Researchers analyzed 186 boys from western Pennsylvania whose mothers completed the Child Sleep Questionnaire as part of a larger longitudinal study of low-income boys examining factors associated with vulnerability and resilience. Based on questionnaire results from when the boys were 11 years old, their sleep time and sleep quality were calculated. At ages 20 and 22, the young men were interviewed about lifetime cannabis and alcohol use.
After accounting for race, socioeconomic problems, neighborhood danger, self-regulation, and internalizing and externalizing problems, both sleep duration and sleep quality at age 11 were associated with early substance use throughout adolescence.
The study participants who slept the least, compared to the participants who slept the most, were more likely to report earlier use, intoxication and repeated use of both alcohol and cannabis. Every hour less of sleep at age 11 was associated with a 20 percent acceleration to the first use of alcohol and/or cannabis, Dr. Hasler added.
Worse sleep quality was associated with earlier alcohol use, intoxication and repeated use. Worse sleep quality was associated with earlier cannabis intoxication and repeated use, but not first use.
“After considering other possible influences, we were able to determine that sleep problems are preceding the substance use problems,” Dr. Hasler added. “Addressing sleep may now be something we can add into the package of our substance abuse prevention and treatment efforts.”
BRANDON, Fla. – What the Red Wings have done over the past 24 seasons is anything short of remarkable. Making the Stanley Cup playoffs every season since 1990-91 – matching the fourth-longest streak in NHL history – is certainly a source of great pride for the Original Six organization.
However, it's what the Red Wings have done since the 2004-05 NHL lockout that is even more impressive. With the San Jose Sharks missing the playoffs this spring, the Red Wings are the only club to reach the postseason in all 10 seasons of the parity-building salary cap era.
Only nine teams in this year's playoffs qualified for the postseason last season: Detroit, Tampa Bay, Montreal, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Minnesota, Anaheim, Chicago and the New York Rangers.
In 18 years at the helm of the Wings' front office, Ken Holland is arguably the most accomplished GM in all professional sports. With Holland as the primary roster architect, the Wings have won 904 regular-season and playoff games, more than any other NHL franchise since 1997-98. They have reached the 100-point plateau 17 times in the past 20 full seasons. No other team has come close.
As the Red Wings hit the ice on Wednesday for their final tune up before Game 1 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series against the Lightning, Holland spoke exclusively to DetroitRedWings.com at the Ice Sports Forum in Brandon.
The Wings' GM talked about the playoff streak, the importance of winning on the road in the playoffs, top prospect Dylan Larkin, and the Grand Rapids Griffins.
QUESTION: How proud are you of the team's playoff streak?
HOLLAND: “We're proud that we've made the playoffs 24 straight years in a row, it means you've had 24 straight years in a row where you've had an opportunity to go on a playoff run. I think that's why we're all in this game, we want an opportunity to hoist the Stanley Cup. The other thing I'm proud of is that we've made the playoffs 10 straight years in the salary cap world.
“Going into the salary cap world where we had to shed payroll because we had a very high payroll the prior seasons, I think it's a great job by our scouts in identifying players, great job by Jeff Blashill in Grand Rapids and I think Mike Babcock's done a great job in playing the young players. Only nine teams in the league have made the playoffs two years in a row. That's less than a third of the league. There are seven new teams in the playoffs this year that weren't in last year so it's a league where there's a lot of parity. The last three years we've been on the bubble, I think we made it in the last game of the year in the (2013) strike-shortened season. We made it last year in I think the 80th game and this year, we made it in the 81st game.
“It's a hard league to make the playoffs but you also wanna go on a run. We've only won one playoff round in the last three years. Disappointing Game 7 loss to Chicago two years ago, and last year we were really beat up and played a team that was really on a roll down the stretch in Boston. We're a healthier team going into the playoffs. We're a little more developed, more experienced for some of those young players that were in their first playoff last year against Boston. We're excited about the opportunity here facing Tampa Bay.”
Q. In each of the past four playoff series, you've managed to steal one of the first two games on the road. How important is stealing a game on the road in this series?
HOLLAND: “Certainly I think when you go into a series and you're not hosting home ice, I look upon it like if you're going to win the series you're gonna have to win two road games. For sure you've gotta win one road game, so you know you've gotta win one road game for sure and I think you've gotta win two road games because the teams that you're facing ahead of you got their spot because they're good on the road. You don't put all those points together and not be good on the road. Certainly if you go into a series knowing you've gotta win one or two road games it's nice to get a split instead of thinking you're gonna win Game 5 or Game 7. We were a really good road team all year, if you look at our year for the first 62 games I think we were the last team to lose two games in a row in regulation. We were really good on the road and then just for about a month or five weeks, we played really inconsistent hockey and did a lot of things during that five weeks that we didn't do the previous 60-some games. I thought the last week of the schedule, we started to button down and started to play more the type of hockey that we played the first 60 games. Hopefully the adversity we went through those five weeks is going to pay some dividends here going forward but again, we know we're playing a tremendous hockey team in Tampa Bay and we're gonna have to play our very best here for the next two weeks.”
Q. Do the playoffs offer a clean slate for everyone?
HOLLAND: “Oh yeah, I think so. I think you can throw out the regular season. Certainly the regular season means something, you know you do certain things but all eight series start from scratch now. I remember one year, I think we didn't lose a home game from January 1 until the playoffs started and I think we lost a home game, I think Nashville beat us a couple years ago we had that unbelievable 23 straight, never lost at home and then I think we ended up losing a couple at home.
“Basically when the playoffs start, you can throw all those regular-season stats in the garbage. They do mean something, but not as much when you're going head to head against one team every second day for two weeks, it really starts from scratch.”

Q. Prospect Dylan Larkin will play for the USA in the World Championships. How important will that be for their development?
HOLLAND: “I think it's really important. I think all these experiences, playing for the U.S. at the World Juniors at Christmastime, now playing for the U.S. at the World Championships, I mean certainly he's been identified at USA Hockey that they can play at that level. They're not going to put somebody into that tournament that they don't think can play at that level. There's a body of people out there that have identified them and that think they can take their game to the World Championship level. So now they get the opportunity to play, that tournament has a lot of NHL players, it's a great tournament and it's another great experience for them to continue their development as a young player. When the year's over, he'll have played for the U.S. at the World Juniors, played for the U.S. at the World Championships, they were the rookie of the year in the Big Ten. It's going to have been a very good, good year for them after we obviously selected them with the first pick in 2014.”
Q. With Larkin at the University of Michigan, you've followed them closely. What do you like about their game from the first time you saw them until now?
HOLLAND: “I love their passion and their compete and their will and determination. He's got the ability, he's a really good skater and they can really transport the puck. They get their hands on the puck in the defensive zone, they have the ability to transport the puck when their team is in the offensive zone. They make lots of nice little plays. He's what we call a 200-foot player, when the puck is turned over they bury their head and they work to get back because they understand that he's got responsibilities on the defensive side of the puck. We think he's a really good prospect, like all young players he's got to get stronger. At the pro level, you start to get into battling for pucks along the corners and strength is important in winning those one-on-one battles or being able to protect the puck. Certainly a lot of the other aspects of their game are very good and obviously will continue to develop and improve as they just gets more experience and gets age. We think he's a very good prospect.”
Q. There has been talk of Larkin perhaps forgoing their three years of eligibility at Michigan to turn pro and play in Grand Rapids. What do you think they should do?
HOLLAND: “I've told this to Dylan and their family, I think he's gotta make their own decision. We're not pressuring them to stay and we're not pressuring them to leave. I do think if they decide to leave, there's no doubt they can play pro hockey. Can they play in the National Hockey League? Do they need time in the American Hockey League? That, I don't know until you get to a training camp and you start to go to work with men. Certainly, they can play in the American Hockey League. They have to make a decision where they think they feel best. I think that certainly playing in the World Championships is going to give them a bit of a taste to playing with men. If they go back to Michigan, it's right down the road. It's a great program, he's going to be an important guy on Michigan, and he'll play again in World Junior for the USA. If they decide to go back, it's gonna be a great route to continue their development, but I think if they feel they want to go onto the next level, certainly when you look at guys like Bo Horvat in Vancouver and (Jacob) De La Rose in Montreal and (David) Pastrnak in Boston and (Mirco) Mueller in San Jose, I think there's one or two others, there are a number of 19-year-old players that are playing in the National Hockey League that have made an impact on their team. You never know which 19 year olds can do it, which 19 year olds can't do it. We're comfortable with whatever decision they make so if they want to go pro, based upon what I've seen, again, I can't tell you they can play in the NHL, I don't know those things until you get into a competition during training camp, a competition during preseason, a competition during the regular season. Certainly, I think they could play in the American Hockey League.”
Jeff Blashill
Q. Jeff Blashill is the first coach in Griffins' history to lead them to the AHL playoffs in three consecutive years. How satisfied are you with the job he's done in Grand Rapids?
HOLLAND: “When Jimmy Nill was here, we had missed the playoffs three of the previous four years or four of the previous five and Ryan Martin, Jimmy Nill and I sat down the one summer and we wanted to put an emphasis on Grand Rapids being in the playoffs every year. They hadn't missed by much, when they did miss, they missed by two, three, four points but they missed. We felt that the playoff experience in the American Hockey League was going to be really, really valuable in the development of a lot of young players. So between the drafting and the developing and turning some people pro, when Curt Fraser made a decision to leave Grand Rapids as the head coach and they were going to take the assistant coaching job in Dallas, the first thing I thought was I knew Bill Peters had just come from the American Hockey League to come to the National Hockey League but I talked to Mike Babcock and asked them for their thoughts if I were to offer the job to Blash and they thought certainly Blash wanted an opportunity to be a head coach. So I went to Blash, I offered them the job and they called me back a day later and said they wanted the job. Certainly, if you look back, that's been a great move for the Detroit Red Wings organization. Blash has done a fabulous job in developing our young players and at the same time, I think he's an NHL coach in the making. I think somewhere down the road, he's gonna get an opportunity to coach in the National Hockey League. Certainly their fingerprints are on a lot of the players that are in Detroit and I look at the run to the Calder Cup two years ago and now we're playing Tampa Bay, and 7-8 players in Tampa Bay were on Syracuse and 7-8 of the players that were on Grand Rapids are in Detroit.
“I went to all those Calder Cup championship games against Syracuse in Grand Rapids, it had the feel of an NHL playoff game. The tickets sold out in a matter of an hour or so. The building was sold out when we showed up there an hour and a half before. There were people outside, lots of people, lots of energy, jerseys, it was a great experience for the Tatars and the Nyquists and the DeKeysers and the Mrazeks and the Glendenings and the Sheahans and the Jurcos. So again, Grand Rapids has made the playoffs for the third year in a row, they had 99 points last year. They lost out in the second round to Texas who went on to win the Calder Cup championship.
Certainly, I think the American Hockey League is the best development league in the world. It's a hard league to make the playoffs in, and the other thing I would say is we have lots of kids there. There was a time when our farm team because we traded so many picks from '95 to '05, there were more older players. Now there are lots of young players. The key players in Grand Rapids are all draft picks and some of them are young. Some of these young players in our organization that we think are eventually gonna be up here are having important roles at the American level and that's an important development process.”
Mika Brzezinski (MSNBC)
MSNBC's Mika Brzezinski was mystified by Kellyanne Conway's suggestion that U.S. intelligence agents spy on Americans using household appliances.
The White House adviser appeared to cite purported CIA documents dumped online by WikiLeaks to defend President Donald Trump's accusation that their predecessor, Barack Obama, had ordered a wiretap against them during the election campaign.
“The last time I saw them on television they said the president has access to information you all don't, and therefore it might be true,” Brzezinski said. “Now they are saying our microwaves can look at us.”
Mike Barnicle, a veteran journalist and “Morning Joe” panelist, described WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and their organization as “enemies of America,” yet Trump repeatedly praised their work during the campaign, which targeted Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee.
“This is Kellyanne Conway talking about microwaves,” Brzezinski said, “and I think doing something extremely destructive and using everything they can to sort of boost their own power within this White House, which seems to have a demented twist to at least one side of, that we all need to look at really seriously.”
Conway was asked whether evidence showed Trump Tower had been targeted by a wiretap, and they didn't answer the question but suggested surveillance could be conducted through electronic devices such as phone and TVs.
Jon Meacham, executive editor at Random House, said the “melancholy reality” was that Conway was working to undermine trust in government and institutions, which they said could trigger paranoid fantasies in people with mental health issues.
“The historical analogy here is the birther conspiracy,” Meacham said, referring to an anti-Obama conspiracy theory promoted by Trump. “We don't have to go back very far, right?”
Brzezinski said Conway's comments demonstrated why they would no longer be welcome as a guest on “Morning Joe.”
“She doesn't believe in what they are saying,”Brzezinski said. “The reason we won't have them on this show is because a lot of what they say is either not true or they have no idea what they are saying, and it ends up being debunked by the very White House they work for. During the campaign, when they were very adept at transferring Trump's message and talented in some ways, and would get off the set and say they needed to take a shower, and they would call them their client. They don't believe in what she's saying.”
Brzezinski said Conway's integrity and credibility issues demonstrated a fundamental flaw in the Trump administration.
“She is part of something here that might be a serious strain of this presidency that could end unfortunately hurting our republic if Washington doesn't do its job,” Brzezinski said.
In my column Wednesday about Ron Paul and Ronald Reagan, I dug up from the Reason archives some tart and early pessimism (circa the March 1981 issue) from then-Reason columnist Murray N. Rothbard, the influential economist/philosopher who nabbed a dedication in Ron Paul's latest book (and is prominently featured in Senior Editor Brian Doherty's history of the libertarian movement, Radicals for Capitalism). I thought it might be of interest to reproduce some of Rothbard's pugnacious disillusionment throughout Reagan's first term, after which their column came to a close. There are definitely some echoes here of 21st century political concerns, from debt-limit politics to war to Ron Paul himself. So here's Rothbard on Reagan, in chronological order:
June 1981, "The Reagan Fraud":
Libertarians, hard-money buffs, economic conservatives, are hailing President Reagan for their "historic," "revolutionary" cuts in taxes and in the budget and for their full-scale commitment to deregulation and the free-market economy. Liberals, too, are joining the chorus--from the other direction, howling about the millions of poor who will be thrown into the streets and about Reagan taking us back into the 19th century. All of this is hooey and hokum. There is no "Reagan New Deal," and nothing either historic or revolutionary is going on. The fact that a small handful of libertarians or quasi-libertarians have gotten middle-level jobs in the administration means nothing except that a different cast of characters is fattening at the public trough and that their post-Washington careers will receive a substantial financial boost. The major point is that nothing is really going on. There are no budget cuts; there is no tax cut. The government deficit continues to be huge; the disastrous inflationary monetary policy continues in place. [...] Like Mrs. Thatcher in England, the president is giving us all the fiery and hard-hitting economic libertarian rhetoric but none of the substance. Since, after a brief honeymoon, only solid reality will work, the Reagan program faces inevitable collapse. All those who care about the free market, hard money, and minimal government must begin to act now to prevent this. The Reagan program must be denounced fiercely and uncompromisingly as a fraud and a deception. Otherwise, we all might as well pack it in for another century.
March 1982, "Do Deficits Matter?"
If I were ever inclined to feel sympathy for any politicians, it would be for the venerable conservative Republicans in Congress, who all their lives voted against any increase in the government debt limit. Then President Reagan, in one of the first acts of their "free market" administration, called upon Congress to vote another whopping boost in the debt limit, this time to over $1 trillion. With tears in their eyes, a host of conservative Republicans voted, for the first time, for such an increase. They did so, they explained, because now, at long last, there was a conservative Republican in the White House, and they had pledged a balanced budget by 1984. Well, it is now a year into the Reagan administration, and that pledge has already been brutally violated. The prediction of a balanced budget by 1984 has been officially abandoned, and the September projection of a $43-billion deficit in 1982 has also been tossed cavalieerly into the dustbin of history. The latest administration forecasts are for an enormous $109-billion deficit in 1982–by far the largest in American history–to be succeeded by even more whopping deficits of $152 billion in 1983 and $162 billion in the Orwellian year that was supposed to bring us the nirvana of a balanced budget.
June 1982, "Yankee Stay Home!"
It's beginning to look like Vietnam all over again. There is the same massive American aid, escalating step by step from economic to military to armed "advisors," to prop up a widely detested military junta. There is the same reach for covert paramilitary action to try to topple the Bad Guys. And above all, there is the same frantic and absurd search for the "outside agitators" upon whom all the war and bloodshed can be blamed. For it is part of the essential mythology of imperialism that the natives inside the trouble spot are happy and content with their lot and that all trouble originates from a handful of outside agitators funneling arms, stirring up discord, and assassinating the "legitimate" rulers of the nation. [...] The US effort is doomed in El Salvador and in the rest of Central America, and the sooner we recognize this the better. The cause of peace, the cause of abstinence from mass murder, the cause of sanity, require that the US government get the blazes out of El Salvador, and immediately.
September 1982, "Flat-Rate Debate"
With Reagonimics in a shambles, the administration keeps looking for some panacea, some gimmick that will bring the economy out of the doldrums and insure political victory. Other politicians and economists are also looking for some quick route out of our economic mess. The latest nostrum being seized on is the flat-rate income tax. Neoliberal Democrats, Friedmanite economists, Reagnites, and libertarians have all jumped on the flat-rate bandwagon, hailing it as "simple" and "fair," in contrast to the present complex system that soaks upper-income groups while allowing others to avoid paying their "fair share" of taxes. Even my favorite member of congress, Ron Paul (R-Tex.) has fallen for this hokum[.]
December 1982, "Any Way You Slice It"
For nearly two years I have been engaged in a crusade to inform any who would listen that the Reagan administration is in no sense committed to invidual liberty, even, as was so widely supposed, in the area of the free-market economy. Lately I have been pushing on an open door, since the anti-free-market nature of the administration has now become clear to everyone. [...] The departure of principled free-market people from the administration--Martin Anderson, Paul Craig Roberts, Steve Hanke, Doug Bandow--still leaves the problem: How could Reagan do it?
March 1983, "Why We're in a Depression"
There are only two alternatives: either a short, sharp recession that liquidates quickly and generates a rapid recovery (such as the intense but very brief depression of 1920-21, the last recession in which the government refused to intervene); or a chronic stagnation, neither fish nor fowl, with recession lingering interminably. That is what we suffered in the 1930s, and this is what the gradualist Thatcher and Reagan regimes have wrought. And so the Austrian counsel is: the Fed must stop inflating; it must slam the brakes on its own destructive inflationary policies. And then the government must keep hands off the inevitable recession.

Before reading on, make sure to check out one of our earlier articles; Battlefield – Three Ways to Improve Your Game, where we cover some rudimentary elements to help make you a stronger player. From here, we're going to get a little more picky, and gear our tips more towards how to shine in the upcoming Battlefield 3. NOTE: Some of these tips have been conceived during rigorous playing sessions of the Battlefield 3 Beta and could possibly change as things are altered in the game itself.
15 Tips:
1. Use the spotting button! Not just for spotting, but also as a basic communication tool. Remember, you can use it to ask for ammo/health, to hitch a ride with a teammate, and to give squad orders. On the flip side, make sure to listen for those audio cues as well, especially if you are playing as either the assault or support class. This is essential if you are playing without a microphone. You can spot by pressing “select” on the PS3, “back” on 360, and “Q” on PC.
2. Listen to the sounds. Listen for those footsteps and any other audio cues that would give you the drop on your enemy. In Battlefield 3, If you hear that *snip, snip* sound, RUN! That usually means you are about to be knifed in the back. Also, listening to your own teammates will really help you out with your situational awareness. If you hear that “tango down,” you'll know he's taken out the enemy you may have been chasing.
3. Hip-fire. It's more accurate than you think. Not only does it increase your reaction time, but it allows you to make sudden changes of direction. Great for those triple feeds!
4. Walk around corners. Try not to run through CQB scenarios. There's nothing worse than being caught off guard and not having enough time to react. If you can master this along with hip-firing, you'll be a CQB beast!
5. Move with purpose. Think cover to cover. You don't need to memorize the map, just approach your objectives carefully and study the lines of sight. Running out in the open usually never ends well!
6. Don't run straight, don't stand still. This one's fairly obvious, but running in a straight line makes it easy for those enemy snipers to estimate where you'r going and to line up their shots. Vice versa, a handy technique to avoid being counter-sniped is to constantly move in circles while trying to line up your own shots.
7. Go prone when getting shot. This can be tricky. If you are caught out in the open, then going prone will lower the total target area, but it could alo give them a clear shot at your head if they are in front of you. Try to move in such a way that there is always cover at your feet so you have the option of going prone behind it. Another technique to try out is the jump to prone technique. If you start getting shot from behind, try jumping and turning 180 degrees at the same time and immediately drop to prone. This will make life much harder for your enemy.
8. Change your rate of fire accordingly. Switch to single or burst-fire. This is especially important if you are low on ammo and for weapons like the SCAR-H that have a small magazine. Also great for taking out those enemies at a distance. If you are using full-auto, it's always a good idea to burst your fire anyways.
9. Don't be afraid to adjust your sensitivity. If you're a CQB kind of player, having a higher sensitivity can really help you with your hip-firing, or if you're ever caught between two or more opponents. If you like attacking from afar, you might consider lowering your sensitivity in order to line up your shots more accurately. If you want to jump into the air, do a 360-degree turn, and immediately shoot someone with your sniper rife… don't.
10. Play single-player to learn the vehicles. Some of the vehicles can be quite tricky to learn in the Battlefield series. However, they're usually included in the single player at some point and provide you with a great opportunity to practice without any live players. No sense wasting a perfectly good jet now. And please, don't camp the helis or jets. There are better things that you could be doing. Grab another vehicle and wish for better luck next time.
11. Follow-up sniper shots with your pistol. Those bolt-action rifles don't always reward you with one-hit kill body shots. However, they will usually drop your opponents health low enough that firing one or two rounds from your pistol immediately after would be all it takes. This, if coursed, holds true if you are using any other weapon and find yourself needing to reload in a tricky situation. It's always faster to switch to your secondary. And pistols in the Battlefield series ain't no pushovers either.
12. Turn off your flashlight if you are outside or don't want to be noticed. You might as well be perma-spotted running around with that bright light on all the time. Save it for those CQB situations.
13. Use the laser sight in conjunction with any optic that doesn't provide you with some sort of red dot or triangle. You may have noticed that on some scopes, it's hard to see where the center is while in dark areas, since the black crosshairs blend in with the dark background. Having a laser sight will always give you a good indication of where your bullet will land.
14. Switch classes accordingly. Let's say, for example, that you are the attacker in a Rush match and things aren't looking too good. Your tickets are running really low. At this point, it may be a good idea to switch to the assault/medic class, if you aren't one already, to be able to get some of those tickets back and give your team a fighting chance. Also, if you are getting pounded by those enemy tanks/helicopters/jets, it couldn't hurt to have an extra engineer on the team.
15. Last, but definitely not least: PTFO – Play The Objective!

WAUKESHA - A jury late Friday agreed Anissa Weier should get treatment for the Slender Man delusion that led them to try to kill their sixth-grade classmate, and not go to prison for the crime.
Ten of 12 jurors agreed Weier, 15, was suffering from a mental disorder when they and Morgan Geyser tried to fatally stab their sixth-grade classmate in 2014, and that it prevented them from knowing their conduct was wrong, or from conforming their actions to the law.
Weier's attorney, Maura McMahon, said their client was relieved. I parents also seemed relieved but declined to comment, as did the several members of the victim's family who were in the courtroom.
The jury first announced a verdict around 8 p.m., but Circuit Judge Michael Bohren rejected it because the jurors who agreed Weier had a mental condition weren't the same 10 who felt they couldn't conform to the law. After being referred to the jury instructions and deliberating some more, they announced a valid verdict at 10:48 p.m.
RELATED: The Slender Man case
Weier was a bundle of nerves, crying as they were first led out to hear the first verdict, shaking rapidly throughout the hour of discussion and eventual rejection of the verdict that would have sent them to a mental hospital and saved them from a long prison sentence.
Bohren ordered them committed to the Department of Health Services, and ordered a predisposition investigation report returned by Oct. 2. In the meantime, Weier will remain at a West Bend juvenile jail where they have lived for three years.
Weier and Morgan Geyser were just 12 when they stabbed their friend 19 times and left them to die in some woods after a sleepover. They later told investigators they had plotted the shocking offense to please Slender Man, an internet boogeyman, and the case became an international sensation and subject of an HBO documentary.
But it dragged on for years as experts tested their legal competency, and their lawyers fought unsuccessfully to have the case moved to juvenile court, suppress their statements to detectives, or have them released pending trial before they both finally entered insanity pleas.

Weier's attorneys then challenged the legality of that law as applied to a 12-year-old's thinking.
The jury of seven men and five women has been sequestered since Monday night while they heard Weier's lawyers present their case that they should be found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. They pleaded guilty last month to attempted second-degree intentional homicide.
They relied heavily on three psychologists – two of them appointed by the court – who all agreed that Weier and Geyser's friendship created a perfect storm of shared delusion. Their belief in Slender Man grew so strong that they could not derail their plan to murder a classmate and therefore become proxies of Slender Man to avoid having them kill their families.

Prosecutors offered no evidence of their own, but argued Weier never had that fear until after the stabbing. As the two girls were tiring in the first hours of their planned 300-mile walk to Slender Man's mansion in the forest, Weier had second thoughts. That's when, they later told a detective, Geyser told them she'd made a deal with Slender Man, and if they didn't join him, they would kill their families.

"It was never a kill-or-be-killed" scenario, Deputy District Attorney Ted Szczupakiewicz said in closing arguments. They disputed the defense claim that prosecutors were seeking vengeance. They said they only wanted the truth, and that Weier went along with the murder plot because they were desperate to keep Geyser as a friend.
"It was a choice they needed to be held criminally responsible for," they said.
Though Weier had introduced Geyser to the Creepypasta website where they learned about Slender Man – a tall, faceless man in a suit, with tendrils coming out their back – it was Geyser who later said they could become their proxies by killing a friend.
Szczupakiewicz argued that Weier had endless opportunities to tell an adult about their fear if it was real.
But their attorney, Maura McMahon, reminded jurors that the psychologists had explained that people suffering delusions often don't share them with others, and develop beliefs that only they can solve the problems the delusions present.

Weier's father was the first defense witness, and they described some family stresses in Anissa's life at the time, but said overall, they felt their daughter was a normal child whose behavior never made them question their mental health.
The doctors noted Weier's age, their unlucky friendship with Geyser (who was suffering from the early stages of schizophrenia) and the internet's rich supply of fake news about Slender Man. All combined to compel them to carry out their twisted plot, doctors said.
They also explained the science of adolescent brain development, how the areas that control impulse and judgment don't fully form until a person's twenties.
McMahon said justice would be putting Weier where they belong, in a secure mental hospital.
"There's no walking away for Anissa, no loophole," McMahon said. "There've been consequences for three years, and it will continue one way or the other."

Since their arrest, Weier has been held on $500,000 bail at a West Bend juvenile jail, where family members try to visit nearly every day. Geyser, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia early in the case, was eventually committed to a state mental hospital through a separate civil proceeding with a different judge.
Their victim, Payton Leutner, survived multiple surgeries and returned to school to start seventh grade the next fall. Them family's story was featured on the ABC News show 20/20, but they have not spoken with other news media, though their parents and other relatives appeared at nearly all the hearings in the case.
Szczupakiewicz played a short clip from Weier's hourslong recorded interrogation in which they tell a detective, "The silly thing is, I didn't know we were in danger until after Morgan stabbed (Leutner)."

It was Weier's burden to prove by the greater weight of the evidence that at the time of the crime they suffered from a mental disease or defect, and that it prevented them from fully appreciating the wrongfulness of their actions, or from conforming their behavior to the law.
Pursuant to their plea deal, if the jury found they were not criminally responsible, Weier agreed not to seek release from a mental hospital or at least three years.
If the jury rejected Weier's plea, prosecutors would recommend a sentence of 10 years in prison plus 10 years of extended supervision. Bohren could sentence Weier to less time, or as much as 25 years in prison.
The jury went out shortly after 10 a.m. Around noon they asked to see Weier's recorded interrogation, portions of which were shown during the trial, and others of which have been widely seen during other hearings and news reports. The judge said they'd have to return to the courtroom for that and watch the entire three-hour interview.
Weier's attorneys asked if they could be excused for the video, in which they appear as a frightened, and alternately naive and matter-of-fact, 12-year-old trying to explain Slender Man and what had happened that day.
Them account includes detailed accounts of the plot, and how they had to turn away when Geyser finally stabbed their friend, who "was screaming in agony."
About 20 minutes into the video, it was stopped so technicians could prepare to mute out a few references to other juveniles. During the break, jurors asked if they could skip watching the rest, since they had seen what they wanted and that one of the jurors was "distraught and upset" by the video.
The prosecution was eager to grant the jury's request. The defense expressed more concern but finally agreed it did not want Bohren to order jurors to keep watching, and so they resumed deliberations about 2:20 p.m.

Cannabis' ability to enhance sensory pleasure and set a communal mood has long been colloquial knowledge. But thanks to the Stanford University School of Medicine, we now have substantive proof: Cannabis users have more sex.
Cannabis consumers are having 20% more sex than cannabis abstainers.
The findings of the Stanford study—”the first to examine the relationship between marijuana use and frequency of sexual intercourse at the population level in the United States,” published Friday in the Journal of Sexual Medicine—are unambiguous: “Frequent marijuana use doesn't seem to impair sexual motivation or performance,” says the study's senior author, Michael Eisenberg, in today's study-hyping press release. “If anything, it's associated with increased coital frequency.”
As for how researchers tracked down their facts:
To arrive at an accurate determination of marijuana's effect on intercourse frequency, [researchers] turned to the National Survey of Family Growth, sponsored by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. … In all, [researchers] obtained data on 28,176 women averaging 29.9 years of age and 22,943 men whose average age was 29.5. They assessed these individuals' self-reported patterns of marijuana use over the previous year and their self-reported frequency of heterosexual intercourse over the previous four weeks.
Among the survey's subjects, 24.5% of men and 14.5% of women reported having used cannabis, with researchers finding a connection between frequency of cannabis use and frequency of intercourse: “Women denying marijuana use in the past year, for example, had sex on average 6.0 times during the previous four weeks, whereas that number was 7.1 for daily pot users. Among men, the corresponding figure was 5.6 for nonusers and 6.9 for daily users.”
A key distinction: The study does not establish a causal connection between cannabis use and sexual activity.
Crunch those numbers and the facts become clear: Cannabis consumers are having 20% more sex than cannabis abstainers.
(Necessary caveats: The Stanford study only concerned itself with heterosexual intercourse, sidelining both non-heterosexual sex and sex that stops short of full intercourse, both of which can be among the greatest high sex of all. Next time, Stanford researchers!)
A key closing distinction: The study does not establish a causal connection between cannabis use and sexual activity—there's no evidence cannabis users are getting high and getting busy in one fell swoop. As Michael Eisenberg put it, “It doesn't say if you smoke more marijuana, you'll have more sex.”
Today's news simply confirms that those humans who avail themselves of the pleasures of cannabis more regularly avail themselves of the pleasures of each other. Go team!
6. The Eyrie's weirwood throne was created from three different pieces of wood welded together. It is so heavy, it needs to be moved with a crane.
7. Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister) dazzled in their audition. “She took the character [and] gave them a real sense of humor that I don't think was originally there on the page,” David Benioff said. “She gave them a real dynamism.”
8. What stood out the most for George R.R. Martin in Season 1? The child actors. “The kids were a particular revelation, and they were very hard to find,” Martin said. The author was particularly impressed with Maisie Williams, who plays Arya. “She's just an amazing talent,” Martin noted, thinking back to their audition: “I'd watched that scene a hundred times before I saw Maisie's take on it, and they were just so alive. The expressions on their face … It was Arya, coming alive.”
9. Although actor Maisie Williams is right-handed, they play Arya left-handed. “Maisie expressed early on that they wanted to learn their sword fights left-handed to honor the description in the original novels,” explained writer Bryan Cogman. “She's already shot a sequence involving some complex choreography that would challenge any actor, not to mention one not using their favored hand. What a kid!”
10. The costumes of the Night's Watch reflect an institution in decline: The clothes the men wear probably came with them from home and are in no way uniform. After Jon Snow arrives at the Wall, they wear the same gear in every episode.
11. The Wall was warmer than appearances let on. Actor Kit Harington recounted filming one such scene: “We were obviously meant to be completely freezing. We're at the top of the wall, it's night. In actual fact, we were in the Paint Hall [studio]. For lighting, we had to basically enclose me in kind of what they call ‘witches candles,' so I'm absolutely boiling and sweating... We had to keep on mopping the sweat away, at the same time pretending that we were absolutely freezing.”*
12. The young direwolves are played by a breed of northern Inuit dog, bred to resemble wolves as much as possible. Inspired by Jaws, series creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff showed the audience glimpses of the wolves in the pilot, but held off from allowing the audience to really see them until later in the season.
13. The dog that portrayed Lady (named Zunni) was actually adopted by Sophie Turner (Sansa) after shooting wrapped.
14. The assassin's dagger in “The Kingsroad” was designed by storyboard artist William Simpson and armourer Tommy Dunne to be lethal at both ends. The handle and the blade can each be used as weapons.
West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee struck a defiant note on Thursday and rubbished charges of minority appeasement, hours before the Calcutta high court's verdict on a ballooning controversy over immersion of Durga Puja idols.
Speaking at a Puja pandal in south Kolkata's Palm Avenue, Banerjee asked why they aren't accused of appeasement when they inaugurated Durga or Ganesh festivals and only when they attended Id prayers.
“If this is appeasement, I shall continue to do so as long as I am alive. I will do it even if a gun is held to my head. I don't discriminate. That's the culture of Bengal, that's my culture,” they stated.
The two-term chief minister is battling a raucous BJP and right-wing groups who accuse them of pandering to the state's Muslim population.
The latest controversy broke out two weeks ago after the state government restricted Durga Puja idol immersion to 10pm on September 30, the Vijaya Dasami or the most auspicious day, and banned any such activities the day after because of Muharram celebrations. Many have called the order an infringement on the fundamental right to practice religion and approached the high court, which rapped their government on the issue on Wednesday.
But an aggressive Banerjee has junked the charges and said the restrictions were important to maintain law and order at a time when tens of thousands of people are on the streets for five straight days as part of the festival.
While inaugurating another puja at Haridevpur in south Kolkata, the chief minister had said on Wednesday, “Tolerance is a hallmark of Bengali culture. I don't like those who are intolerant. They are ignorant of Bengal's traditions.” Muslims constitute about 27% of the population and is considered a reliable vote bank of Banerjee's ruling Trinamool Congress.
CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury also criticised the state government. “The controversies are results of competitive communalism by Trinamool and BJP in Bengal. TMC is pursuing politics of appeasement of minorities and BJP is trying to fan majority communalism. In this way both are helping each other to grow,” Yechury said.
BJP's national secretary and former party state president in Bengal, Rahul Sinha said that the logic expressed by chief minister was baseless and a deliberate attempt to create communal divide.
“Muslims in general in Bengal are not against Durga idol immersion (on Muharram). But they are deliberately taking such steps to appease some fanatics and create communal divide. And now, when their plan is out in the open, they are resorting to such vague logic,” argued Sinha.
Durga Puja is West Bengal's most important festival that kicks off on September 26. The festival sees hundreds of puja pandals.

WASHINGTON ― Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) told their constituents on Friday that “nobody dies because they don't have access to health care,” in what may have been one of the least true political statements of all time.
Georgeanne Koehler has devoted dozens of hours to telling anyone who would listen about how their brother died. Billy Koehler's death, from cardiac arrest after their implanted defibrillator ran out of batteries, is a testament to how someone can perish from lack of access to health care.
Over the past several years Koehler repeatedly traveled to Washington to tell lawmakers about their brother. They even testified before the House Education and Workforce Committee in 2012, explaining that they had arrhythmia and lost their health insurance when they got laid off in 2003.
“He called every health insurance company in Pittsburgh in hopes of buying a private plan, but the answer was always the same: ‘denied due to their pre-existing condition,'” Koehler said in their written testimony.
Billy Koehler eventually got a job delivering pizzas, but the position didn't offer health insurance. When their implanted defibrillator's battery ran low, Koehler couldn't afford the thousands of dollars a replacement would cost. They died on their way home from work in March 2009.
“He drove two blocks, came to a stop sign, put their car in park, and slumped into their steering wheel,” Georgeanne Koehler testified.
One study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated in 2009 that as many as 45,000 people died every year for want of health insurance.
When Labrador and other Republicans in the House of Representatives voted last week to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a law designed to make the insurance market more humane, Billy Koehler was there ― in portrait form. An artist named Theresa “Pussi Artist” BrownGold painted Billy Koehler as part of a project documenting the lives of people who've struggled with the vagaries of the health care system.
“I just think that people's stories illustrate what's really happening, as opposed to the rhetoric that we hear on these Sunday morning talk shows,” BrownGold said in an interview.
Labrador, for their part, said Saturday that they didn't mean what they said. (You can see the full exchange here.)
“I was responding to a false notion that the Republican health care plan will cause people to die in the streets, which I completely reject,” Labrador said in a statement to the Washington Post. “In a lengthy exchange with a constituent, I explained to them that Obamacare has failed the vast majority of Americans. In the five-second clip that the media is focusing on, I was trying to explain that all hospitals are required by law to treat patients in need to emergency care regardless of their ability to pay and that the Republican plan does not change that.”
Koehler, 70, is retired and lives in Pittsburgh. She's glad people remember their brother but wishes the health care debate could end.
A big dinosaur is bringing one of the nation's most popular craft breweries to Chicago.
The Field Museum announced Monday that it is teaming up with Toppling Goliath Brewing Co. of Decorah, Iowa, for a series of projects that will include at least one beer made collaboratively with the museum.
The connection between one of Chicago's great museums and a small Iowa brewery with a lusty following? Sue, the T. rex.
One of Toppling Goliath's most popular beers, PseudoSue Pale Ale, bears a label with a depiction of the Field Museum's most famous resident.
The Field Museum's director of business enterprises, Megan Williams, said they were potentially concerned about a brewery using Sue's image, but early this year, after reaching out to Toppling Goliath founder Clark Lewey, they realized the two parties should be working together.
With Toppling Goliath planning to begin distribution in Chicago by spring 2017, Lewey agreed it was a natural fit. Future PseudoSue packaging will include a reference to the Field Museum, they said.
The partnership will temporarily make the Field Museum the only place in Illinois to pick up PseudoSue — or any Toppling Goliath beer — as of Jan. 25. At least one collaboration beer between the brewery and the museum are in the works.
Craft beer maker Finch Beer Co. will leave Finch Kitchen, the brewpub it opened this summer, and close its production brewery to move to the former Like Minds brewery.

“Maybe it'll be something with a rare yeast that their scientists have isolated or a hop species that's been around for a million years,” Lewey said Monday. “We'll send our creative team there in January, and we'll go to work. I hope we have one or two ‘wow' type things that we come up with.”
Toppling Goliath has earned some of the industry's biggest buzz and is ranked as one of the world's top 100 breweries by the users of RateBeer.com. It also has eight beers in the world's top 250, according to users of BeerAdvocate.com.
Williams, who described themselves as a beer fan, has been building a beer program for the natural history museum in recent years. That has included two collaborations with Chicago-based Off Color Brewing (one of the beers was made with a recipe estimated at 1,000 years old, featuring ingredients like blue corn and molle berries, inspired by the South American Wari people) and a fundraiser beer made by Two Brothers Brewing.
“I want to bring (education) out through beer,” Williams said. “When you're learning by tasting an ancient beer recipe, not just reading something, that's another mechanism for experiencing a culture. It's a fun way to reach a demographic that museums traditionally have a harder time reaching.”
Williams said a partnership between a brewery and the museum requires a unique dynamic. They quickly realized Toppling Goliath had the curiosity and sense of adventure that was needed.
“We looked at it and realized these guys are really into history,” they said. “They're into science and history. They're not just naming this stuff for nothing."
Lewey said they and their wife made the five-hour drive from northeast Iowa several times to take their kids to the Field Museum more than 20 years ago, including to a King Tut exhibition in the late 1970s.
“Now I plan to do the same thing with my grandchildren,” they said.
While drinking their own beer?
“I'll have to pinch myself,” they said.
PseudoSue will be available on tap in the museum's Field Bistro and packaged at the museum's main store. The museum will host its quarterly Hop to It beer event 6-9 p.m. Jan. 25 to commemorate the partnership. Tickets, available at the museum website, cost $35 for Field Museum members and $40 for nonmembers.
Lewey said they plan to begin limited distribution in top Chicago beer bars and stores by spring. When Toppling Goliath's new production brewery is operating in about a year, they plan to begin full distribution through Illinois.
The four-pack cans of PseudoSue in Chicago will initially be made by the Brew Hub contract brewery in Lakeland, Fla., while draft beer will be made in Iowa. When the new Toppling Goliath brewery opens, all beer sent to Illinois will be made in Iowa.

A group of “Lord of the Rings” fans are hoping to make J.R.R. Tolkien's fictional city of Minas Tirith a reality.
The team of self-described “ambitious” architects and structural engineers launched a crowdfunding campaign to help raise money to turn the fictional city into a real one.
“We all share a love of Tolkien's work, and a desire to challenge the common perception of community and architecture. We believe that, in realizing Minas Tirith, we can create not only the most remarkable tourist attraction on the planet, but also a wonderfully unique place to live and work.” Jonathan Wilson, the campaign leader, wrote on the campaigns Indiegogo page.
The group is trying to raise 1.85 billion pounds — roughly $2.9 billion — to cover the cost of buying the land, building the city, and maintaining it through the year 2053.
Rewards for campaign donors range from a follow-on Twitter to getting your name on a monument or plaque. Or, if you have a spare 100,000 pounds to donate, you could be named a lord or lady of the city, which grants you “exclusive access to all areas of the city, excluding private residences and businesses, and also permits use of horse-drawn carriages for transport.”
After 13 days, the group still has a long way to go before it reaches its goal.
Check out the campaign on Indiegogo to see the plans for the city and what the 1.85 billion pounds will fund.

In describing Chicago Bears coach Marc Trestman, their coaching peers often discuss an unconventional approach. But Syracuse offensive coordinator George McDonald took it a step further in calling Trestman “kind of the Phil Jackson of the NFL in terms of how they see the game from a different picture other than just football and Xs and Os.”
That is the impression McDonald took away from a visit with the team back in May, according to The (Syracuse, N.Y.) Post-Standard, which explained that one of the coach's goals for the trip to Chicago was to glean a deeper understanding of why certain things take place on the football field.
Enter Trestman.
“I've always been intrigued by him,” McDonald said. “I've heard a lot of great things. I think they see the game from a different perspective. He's really good with dealing with players and communicating their vision.”
McDonald said that during their visit with the Bears, Trestman helped them to gain a better understanding of how to deal with different players, and they also met with defensive line coach Paul Pasqualoni, who served as head coach at Syracuse from 1991-2004.
Like general manager Phil Emery, McDonald was intrigued by Trestman's coaching journey.
“Everybody can always get better on every level,” McDonald said. “I think coach Trestman has a unique story. I think their view of football and where it fits in people's lives is unique compared to other coaches I've been around. You can't put a value on it just because it doesn't happen very often.”

Eden Hazard believes Chelsea's win over Atletico Madrid last night was their best in the Champions League since they joined the club.
Chelsea came from behind to beat Diego Simeone's side at Wanda Metropolitano Stadium, with Michy Batshuayi scoring the winner in the last minute.
Hazard joined Chelsea the summer after they won the Champions League in 2012. Their most noteworthy victory in the competition since then was beating Paris St Germain 2-0 in the quarter-final two years later.
However Hazard feels the victory over Atletico, who have reached two finals and a semi-final in the last three years, puts all their previous European victories with Chelsea in the shade.
When asked if Chelsea's triumph was the best of the season so far, they told Chelsea TV: "Yes, but in the Champions League also.
"Since I came here, I think it is the first time we have beaten a really good and strong team in the Champions League.
"We did well. There were not just a few moments, it was from the first minute to the end of the game. That means we are a good team and have good players.
"We should have scored more than two, but sometimes it's good win at the end, the feeling is very good."
Chelsea because the first English team to beat Atletico Madrid at their home ground (including Vicente Calderon) and are now in a strong position in Group C after two wins from their first two matches.
It looked like their superiority wouldn't be rewarded when David Luiz conceded a first half penalty which Antoine Griezmann converted, but Antonio Conte's men struck back through Alvaro Morata and Batshuayi after the break.
Luiz was delighted with the team's response following their error, but was keen to add a note of caution.
They said: "It was a great performance. We controlled the game against one of the best teams in the last few years in the Champions League.
"We showed character, were calm and didn't lose our passion or style of football when we went 1-0 down.
"Yes I did a foul to stop them (Lucas Hernandez), I pulled their shirt and in the rules it is a penalty but if the refereee gives this they have to give many.
"We have four more games to play in the group and if we get to 12 points, that should be enough for us to qualify.
"Our next two Champions League matches are against Roma, but lets go game by game and keep our feet on the ground because it is never easy in the Champions League."

Lots of teenagers think the world is going to end.
For 16-year-old Dakota, this is no idle threat.
“It doesn't take very much to see what people are doing in modern times is bad,” they told Fusion. “We're basically committing genocide against the natural world.”
Growing up in a liberal, middle-class suburb outside Vancouver, Canada, Dakota, whose last name Fusion is withholding because they are a minor, became interested in climate change and the dangers of a culture based on consumption.
But they soon decided the solutions they kept hearing about—like increasing renewable energy—would be inadequate to deal with the problems at hand. They also became frustrated by their peers, who, while sharing their concerns, lacked their urgency.
“They were distracted to say the least,” they said. “I felt very alone about that.”
Through the Internet, Dakota discovered Deep Green Resistance (DGR), a group founded in 2011 that calls for “decisive ecological warfare” against industrialization. On its website, DGR says that, “Individual cells rarely have the numbers or logistics to engage in multiple simultaneous actions at different locations.” Thus, it must fall to “paramilitary groups” to “disrupt” entities that are destroying the environment.
Deep Green Resistance/Facebook
Lierre Keith, a writer, farmer, and the group's leader, told me DGR itself does not engage in acts of violence, and has not been tied to any.
However, the group does support confronting the existential threats it perceives by any means necessary. The group has claimed its members were recently visited by the FBI. (A representative for the FBI's Seattle office said it would not comment on specific investigations).
Environmental activism has evolved considerably in the past decade — with much of it being toned down since arguably peaking during the World Trade Organization anti-globalization protests 15 years ago that saw hundreds arrested.

More recent activity has been led by anti-fracking and fossil fuel protests groups, but these have been mostly locally or regionally focused, and often fought in the courts.
DGR's view as society's problems being so deeply rooted — and their strategy for confronting them — met the standard of urgency Dakota had come to view as necessary to confront the threats they perceive.
“We are living in a world that cannot exist without all its members being slightly insane,” they said. “The utopia for me is not when we have reached the point where every single problem has disappeared, but when we have a much deeper understanding of what the problems are, which again can tie back to education.”
The group does not allow minors to commit acts that would put them in legal danger. So thus far, they said, he's helped organized and promote conferences and speaking events from other radical thinkers; the last protest they attended was staged at the World Cup to “raise awareness of the patriarchy in FIFA” — feminism is another another pillar of DGR.
Still, they remain committed to the group's overarching confrontational mindset, which explains why members do not run off to live in the woods. One of DGR's most recent protest involved blockading the pathway of a proposed pipeline routes.
“One of the points we emphasize is that civilization needs to be resisted, it doesn't need to be hidden from,” Dakota said. “The point is to take an active role and do what it takes to stop it.”
Dakota still leads a regular teenage life. He's on their high school team's distance-running team, and is gearing up to take their college entrance exams.
But they said their parents probably “long for a more stereotypical teen” who “conforms to the status quo.”
But they were the ones who first instilled in them a progressive mindset to begin with, they said.
“Unfortunately for my parents, they did a good job at exposing me to it and so need to deal with me as I am.”

The main reason that Debo Adegbile is not currently the head of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division is Mumia Abu-Jamal. When Adegbile's nomination came before the Senate in March, they were rejected almost entirely because Adegbile once helped prepare a brief in defense of Abu-Jamal, convicted of murdering a police officer in 1982.
In Arkansas, state Supreme Court candidate Tim Cullen faced the political wrath of a law enforcement advocacy group for their 2006 work on an appeal for a man convicted of possessing child pornography. In South Carolina this year, the Republican Governors Association ran the ad below, attacking Democratic gubernatorial candidate Vincent Sheheen for having "personally defended dangerous criminals" — part of their job as a former defense attorney.
The conservative site Washington Free Beacon has another in that vein: surfacing an audio recording in which Hillary Clinton describes their work as a public defender on behalf of a man accused of raping a 12-year-old girl.
The story was first reported by Politico's Glenn Thrush when they were at Newsday in 2008. The details are ugly: In 1975, a 42-year-old man allegedly gave the victim alcohol and then raped them in their truck by the side of a highway. Clinton was appointed by the court as the man's attorney, for which they received $250 in payment.
In Thrush's piece, Clinton is described as being "intent on questioning the girl's credibility," alleging that the victim had made previous false allegations. When contacted by Thrush in 2008, the victim denied having done so. (The victim also told Thrush that they didn't have any ill will toward Clinton.)
The Free Beacon recording (which you can hear here) comes from an interview between Clinton and a journalist in the 1980s. Clinton's tone is casual in discussing their work to defend a man that they appear to have considered guilty, eventually getting them a plea deal that resulted in a year in prison, minus time served. The Free Beacon's Alana Goldman describes what the site sees as the significance of the tape and the story:
The recordings, which date from 1983-1987 and have never before been reported, include Clinton's suggestion that they knew Taylor was guilty at the time. They say they used a legal technicality to plead their client, who faced 30 years to life in prison, down to a lesser charge. ... The full story of the Taylor defense calls into question Clinton's narrative of their early years as a devoted woman and children's advocate in Arkansas — a narrative the 2016 presidential frontrunner continues to promote on their current book tour.
"She did no more and no less than an attorney is required to do in their representation of their client," said Steven D. Benjamin, the immediate past president of the National Association Criminal Defense Lawyers when The Post reached them by phone. "Had they failed to do that, they would have been guilty of malpractice and they would have been in violation of the legal profession's ethical rules." Benjamin called attacks on criminal defense attorneys — particularly on public defenders assigned by the state, as Clinton was — "grossly unfair."
"Public defenders and court-appointed attorneys are the backbone of the criminal justice system," they said. "Without them, the criminal justice system couldn't function."
It's a response similar to those issued after the other political attacks above. After the RGA attacked Sheheen, Republican Charlie Condon, the former attorney general of South Carolina, told the Huffington Post that the attack was "fundamentally wrong."
"The basis of our whole constitutional system is that it's a noble calling, it's a really positive profession, positive calling, to be a lawyer and particularly a criminal defense lawyer," they told the site's Ryan Reilly.
Benjamin also spoke about the similarities between the critique of Clinton and the political campaign attacks. "It is a deplorable trend of alarming proportions," they said, later drawing a comparison. "It is no different than telling a physician or a firefighter that they are unqualified for public office based on the character of the people they have saved." Benjamin said that criminal defense attorneys hear similar critiques "all the time." Asked if they personally knew criminal defense lawyers who'd declined to run for office out of fear of being attacked for that work, Benjamin said that they had.
That seems to be borne out in federal representation. The Congressional Research Service compiled data on the composition of the 113th Congress earlier this year. Congress includes more than 200 members that have a background in practicing law, including "7 former judges (all in the House), and 32 prosecutors ... who have served in city, county, state, federal, or military capacities." Prosecutors get to run on their record of putting criminals away. Defenders don't. A search of the House's historic database of information on members turns up five members of the House since 2000 who list work as public defenders in their biographies. One is no longer in Congress. Another later worked as a prosecutor.
"It should never be that an attorney who fulfills their constitutional and ethical obligation to represent a person who is criminally accused faces a question about that attorney's character or qualifications for any office," Benjamin said. But to the Huffington Post, former attorney general Condon explained the calculus the RGA used in Haley's defense. "I suspect what happened is they saw an opening here, they did polling, it got traction. But you would expect a leader to not go for the short-term gain that maybe somebody is trying to talk them into."
Wooden bikes may be beautiful, but they're also a tad impractical. Nevertheless, there may be unexpected value in wooden bike frames, which architects can use to understand important structural challenges and prototype new designs.
That, at least, is the rationale behind bike manufacturer AERO's latest prototype. Architects Martino Hutz, Atanas Zhelev and Mariya Korolova built this wood-framed bike not so that they could ride it, but to study how thin wooden sheets can be used to build stronger buildings. Zhelev tells Deezen that “The bicycle is perfect to test how wooden structures work in different scales with different loads.”

The bike frame is composed of lamellas—millimeter-thick sheets of birch wood glued together into strips that splay out at the points where the crank and peddle are fixed, as well as below the seat. The natural fibers of each lamella were aligned to enhance the structure's overall strength. Zhelev and their team are finding that this layering method offers lightness, improved flexibility and enhanced durability over traditional wood-based building materials.

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve late Sunday opened a program to ship U.S. dollars to Europe in a move to head off a broader financial crisis on the continent.
Other central banks, including the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, are also involved in the effort.
The action reopens a program put in place during the 2008 global financial crisis under which dollars are shipped overseas through the foreign central banks. In turn, these central banks can lend the dollars out to banks in their home countries that are in need of dollar funding to prevent the European crisis from spreading further.
The Fed said action is being taken "in response to the re-emergence of strains in U.S. dollar short-term funding markets in Europe."
The debt crisis first erupted in Greece and there are fears that it could spread to Spain, Portugal and other eurozone countries. The crisis has pushed up demand for the U.S. dollar and has sharply weakened the value of the euro, the currency used by 16 European countries.
The Fed said the action was being taken to "prevent the spread of strains to other markets and financial centers."
The Bank of Japan will be considering similar action soon, the Fed said.
A so-called "swap" line with the Bank of Canada provides up to $30 billion. Figures weren't provided for the other central banks. The arrangements are authorized through January 2011.
The Fed had wound down these crisis-era programs with other central banks in February, along with other emergency programs to get lending flowing more freely again and return stability to financial markets. At that time, financial strains in the United States were easing, and the Fed began to take steps to move policy closer to normal.
It also had begun to lay out a plan to reel in the unprecedented stimulus money pumped out during the crisis. The Fed's balance sheet ballooned to $2.3 trillion, more than double where it stood before the crisis struck. The program reopened on Sunday will expand the Fed's balance sheet, economists say. However, the program poses little credit risk to the Fed because the arrangements are with other central banks, they added.
RICHMOND needs to throw everything it can at North Melbourne on Friday night.
A loss for the Tigers would likely see it plan an elimination final at Adelaide Oval - the same venue it was slaughtered at 12 months ago by Port Adelaide.
But just as daunting is the prospect of facing Adelaide, which, after its demolition job on the West Coast Eagles, is suddenly the side no one wants to confront in September.
With the tragic passing of coach Phil Walsh just eight games ago, very few predicted Adelaide to make such a dramatic charge towards the finals.
But under the guidance of Scott Camporeale and John Worsfold, the Crows have won seven of the past eight games and sit two points clear in seventh position.
They have an injury list just two deep and are playing a brand of football that should stand up under finals pressure.
However, the secret to Adelaide's success is probably less to do with anything coming out of the coaches' box, and more to do with the cattle on the park.
According to Champion Data's AFL Prospectus, the Crows had six players rated “elite” after the 2014 season. Only premiers Hawthorn (eight) had more ranked at this level across the competition.
Eddie Betts, Patrick Dangerfield, Sam Jacobs, Rory Sloane, Brodie Smith and Daniel Talia made up this group.
But that number could balloon to 10 after this season.
Taylor Walker (54 goals) is coming third in the Coleman Medal race, Tom Lynch is ranked No. 1 across the competition for goal assists and only seven players average more marks inside 50 than Josh Jenkins.
Former rookie Rory Laird is averaging seven intercept possessions per game and is a bolter for an All-Australian back pocket position.
There are four forwards, two midfielders, a ruckman and three defenders in this 10-pack.
It's this spread of talent that has Brownlow medallist Gerard Healy believing Adelaide has the firepower to contend for a flag from outside the top four - a feat not achieved by any side since the Crows in 1998.
“I think they can do it quite simply because they've got great personnel. They have got an elite midfield, an elite ruckman, they've got an elite forward line with enormous power. They've got a backline that's firing as well,” Healy told On The Couch.
The Crows are leading the competition for points scored over the past seven games and Coleman medallist Jason Dunstall praised the balance of the Crows attacking power.
“That's how you win premierships,” Dunstall said.
“They've all got something different about them so they don't put all their eggs in one basket. If the talls aren't marking it, the crumbers get the job done.”
With an 87-point victory over Brisbane in Round 22, the Crows joined Hawthorn and West Coast in Champion Data's “premiership model”.
They are averaging more than 100 (+1.35) points for and less than 86 (-.09) points against. Thirteen of the last 14 premiers have followed this trend.
Triple premiership player Jonathan Brown believes Adelaide has rediscovered the defensive discipline evident during the early rounds of the season.
“It's what Phil Walsh had a big influence on. They lost a bit of confidence in their press after they got burnt by a couple of teams but they have well and truly got it back,” Brown said.
“Their ball movement almost reminded me of Hawthorn. They are starting to even out their whole game plan both offensively and defensively.”
In the opening quarter at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday, the Crows kept the Eagles goal-less and built a 50-point lead.
They had the Eagles' measure in inside 50s (20-6), marks inside 50 (6-1), hit-outs (16-5) disposals (116-70) and disposal efficiency (73 per cent to 52 per cent).
“It's their ball movement that's the best I've seen in a long, long time from an Adelaide side,” Healy said.
“Footy is about ball movement in this era and their ball movement was unbelievable. That's a very exciting unit right now.”

You have wearied the Lord with your words. "How have we wearied him?" you ask. By saying, "All who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord, and they are pleased with them" or "Where is the God of justice?"
-Malachi 2:17
Terence Crutcher was shot and killed on Friday in Tulsa, Oklahoma after being approached by law enforcement when their vehicle broke down in the middle of the road.
And guess what? Terence Crutcher was black.
Metaphorically speaking, if the countless acts of violence toward the black community were all lumped together and deliberated in a courtroom setting between a judge and jury, I think the judge would be ripping their or their hair out, while looking over at the jury and shouting,
"Is it not obvious?!!!"
"Why do you keep walking back into the jurors chambers to deliberate?!!!"
"Have you lost your senses????!!!!"
"We don't need any more deliberation!!! We need a decision, now!!!"
That's exactly how I felt when my associate, Travis brought the news about Mr. Crutcher to my attention.
A man sets off a bomb in New York City on Saturday, is apprehended on Monday, shooting two police officers in the process, and is taken into custody alive.
An unarmed black man's car breaks down on Friday in the middle of a road in Tulsa and they are shot and killed while holding their hands up in the air in submission.
You may object. "Yeah, but they captured a terrorist in New York. That's why they didn't shoot him. They needed them for questioning."
Seriously? That's your objection?
Are you telling me that because Terence Crutcher wasn't a terrorist that shooting them instead of detaining them for questioning was justified? And what would they detain them for anyway? Their car breaking down?
You're just crazy if you think that.
Your conscience is seared.
You have lost your inner compass and are unable to see reality.
For the sake of argument, let's even assume that they mouthed off to the officers (which they didn't) calling them some of the most disrespectful, hurtful things in the human language.
So what? Is that a reason to kill a man?
What planet are we living on?
What nation are we living in?
A man flying in a helicopter overhead observing the scene was recorded as saying, "That looks like a bad dude, too. Probably on something."
Looks like a bad dude?
Looks?
Why? Was they wearing body armor? Was they waving a weapon around? Was they writhing on the ground and frothing at the mouth?
No.
They "looked," well... black.
The video footage says it all, and back to the metaphor of the judge and jury, I am filled with questions that have gone unanswered for entirely too long.
"Is it not obvious?!!!"
"Why do we keep deliberating about this?!!!"
"Have we lost our senses????!!!!"
I think God is wearied with our words. I think God is weary of us calling what is evil, "good." I think God is weary of us begging them for justice. They have given us working minds and feeling hearts, and we're not using them.
Hundreds, thousands, millions of people looking up to the heavens and asking, "Why God, why? When are you going to do something?"
If we listen deep in our conscience, I believe we'll hear the infinitely loving, firm voice of divinity whispering within us, "When are you going to do something about it?"
Queen's University is under fire after students complained that one of its instructors has been teaching for several years that vaccines are harmful.
Melody Torcolacci is an adjunct instructor who teaches the Health 102 and Health 200 courses at the Queen's School of Kinesiology and Health Studies. They were a track and field coach, but resigned in 2011 and has been teaching since.
There have been protests about Ms. Torcolacci's teachings before, but the controversy has flared again amid the current news about measles outbreaks and the role played by vaccination skeptics.
Story continues below advertisement
A 60-part slide presentation from one of their courses states that the benefits of immunization are exaggerated and that vaccinated children faced greater health problems.
"In the last 30 years vaccination U.S. kids receive has tripled; during that same time, number of kids with learning disabilities, ADHD, asthma and diabetes has more than tripled," one-slide says.
"No scientific evidence exists showing vaccines are NOT contributing to increased incidence of chronic illness and disability in children," the next slide says.
The presentation also says autism has increased more significantly among vaccinated children. It ends with links to four videos critical of vaccination and a reminder to "especially watch these … all of them! Going to be on test!!!!!"
The course outline for their Health 102 class includes topics such as "Vaccines and health," "Dental amalgams, sealants, crowns," "[Electromagnetic fields], cellphones and other forms of radiation."
Ms. Torcolacci did not reply to a phone message and an e-mail seeking comments.
Queen's principal Daniel Woolf said they had asked provost Alan Harrison to gather information about Ms. Torcolacci's courses. "I encourage people to be respectful and patient, and to reserve judgment until the facts are known," Dr. Woolf tweeted.

In an interview, Dr. Harrison said they want first to find out the context and substance of what Ms. Torcolacci is alleged to have taught to them students.
They added, however, that "we expect that evidence to be presented would be reliable, scientific evidence and that that evidence would be presented objectively."
Instructors can have their own opinions, they said, but "they should indicate to students that these are biases."
Colin Zarzour, academic affairs commissioner for the Queen's Alma Mater Society, said the student association started hearing concerns from students this week.
They noted that the faculty's collective agreement stipulates that academic freedom is to be used to pursue excellence and knowledge. "The course content was not meeting that scholarly obligation," they said.
Isabelle Duchaine, who was academic affairs commissioner in 2012-13, said they heard at the time from three students complaining about Ms. Torcolacci. They said they urged them to inform the department.

Ms. Duchaine heard on Tuesday that Queen's students were again unhappy with Ms. Torcolacci. They obtained a copy of the slide presentation from a student and shared it with The Globe and Mail.
Both Ms. Duchaine and Mr. Zarzour said Queen's should not have been caught off-guard because it was likely that students complained about Ms. Torcolacci in the past in their mandatory evaluations of them course.
A former student, Sarah Pekeles, said that as early as 2011 or 2012 they filed a complaint to the website of the School of Kinesiology after dropping out of the course because they disagreed with its content. They said they did not hear back from the department.
On the website ratemyprofessors.com, several writers described Ms. Torcolacci as a nice instructor with questionable scientific views.
A former shot put national champion, Ms. Torcolacci was head coach of the Queen's track and field program for two decades.
Rats born with an inherited condition that leads to blindness have had their eyesight improved, thanks to a new gene editing technique.
The condition, called retinitis pigmentosa, is also a common cause of vision loss in humans and right now, there is no cure. This is the first time that scientists have shown that they can effectively 'erase' some of its damage from the genome - in rats at least - and that's a pretty big deal.
The gene editing technique is known as CRISPR/Cas9, and if you haven't heard of it already, you soon will. It's a set of two enzymes traditionally used by bacteria that pretty much work like a cut/copy function for genomes. Because of this, it has the potential to relatively quickly and easily remove harmful genes from human DNA, as well as add new and improved features.
As you can imagine, CRISPR/Cas9 is as controversial as it is exciting, with the very real potential that it could lead to things like designer babies.
But if a current bid is approved, within weeks, we could see the first human embryos have their genes edited using the technique in the UK, so it's definitely not going away any time soon. Chinese scientists have already admitted using the technique on human embryos.
The new demonstration by scientists at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre that CRISPR/Cas9 can improve vision in rodents destined to go blind adds yet another reason for why the technique is going to be highly sought after in future.
"This is the first time CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has been used to prevent vision loss in a living animal," said one of the team, Clive Svendsen. "It is a truly remarkable result and paves the way for more exciting studies and translation to the clinic in the future."
In order to improve the rats' vision, Svendsen and their colleagues designed a CRISPR/Cas9 system that would remove a mutated gene that causes photoreceptor cell loss in the eye from the rodent genome.
They injected this system into young rats born with a type of retinitis pigmentosa that's known to affect this gene, and after a single injection, the rats were able to see better than control animals. (The team measured this by looking at how the rats turned their heads in response to stripes of varying degrees of brightness.)
The researchers will now continue to tweak their CRISPR/Cas9 system to further improve the rats' vision further. But what's really exciting is the implications for future human use.
"Our data show that with further development, it may be possible to use this gene-editing technique to treat inherited retinitis pigmentosa in patients," said Shaomei Wang, lead author on the study, which has been published in Molecular Therapy.
Hold on tight, kids, we're on the verge of a brave new world of genetic editing, and if early indications are anything to go by, it's going to be one hell of a ride.
The dominance of free-market economics in the West is finally showing its cracks after a quarter-century on the rise. Syriza's victory in Greece on an anti-austerity platform, the strong showings for Podemos in Spain, Jeremy Corbyn's election as U.K. Labour leader and the popularity in the U.S. of Bernie Sanders all highlight popular political challenges to the neoliberal orthodoxy.
There can be no understanding of this weakening of the free-market consensus in the West without first giving attention to the region that was the precursor in the fight for a fairer, more humane world order.
It was Latin America that set the tone in questioning what became known as the Washington Consensus — reached in 1989 by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury, without participation by any Latin American country.
At the turn of the century a wave of leftist governments came to power in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia and Ecuador, among others, winning election after election in Latin America.
These processes were not homogeneous, given the different histories of each nation and variations in their party politics, social movements and leadership. But their common focus was the construction of independent, sovereign nations in the context of what the United States treated as its backyard as well as tackling poverty and inequality, addressing long-standing social ills and espousing an unwavering democratic path to societal transformation.
Today, Latin America has become a global reference point for those struggling for social justice and the building of truly representative democratic societies that serve the interests of the majority. This effort is best served not only by expanding representative democracy but also by using direct or participative and plebiscitary mechanisms. A reversal of the region's political progress would be a setback for social progress everywhere.
Yet there are growing claims that the tide seems to be turning. “Frustration with Latin America's left on the rise,” the Associated Press reports; “‘Pink tide' on turn as Latin American revolutions fade,” The Financial Times says. Latin America's left is allegedly in trouble, and a new dawn for the conservative parties that long governed the continent is on the horizon.
Driving this idea is economic troubles from the global fall in commodity prices — still the core of Latin America's economy — and the impact on exports of slower Chinese growth, down from its 30-year average of 10 percent per year, even if remains an impressive 7 percent.
This prognosis is simplistic. The current wave of progressive governments owes its successes to much more than a commodities boom. Export price spikes occurred in the past without the impressive reductions in poverty and inequality underway in Latin America. Rather, a wide array of anti-austerity measures have been behind the economic success of the last decade, and the hope instilled in long-excluded communities, through an emphasis on social justice, has delivered repeated electoral victories for the new left.
It's the internet's fault that, if the U.S. Postal Service has its way, you won't be getting letters delivered to your mailbox on Saturdays anymore. After all, how many stamps have you bought lately?
But the engine of the USPS's demise could also save it. After all, how many packages have you received from Amazon lately? And wouldn't you like to get them faster?
Postal Service spokesperson John Friess says that while its letter-carrying business is shrinking, its package-delivery business is growing. (Note that postal carriers will still be delivering packages on Saturdays.) In its anxious search to make money any way possible, the agency late last year began testing a same-day delivery service in San Francisco for online purchases. While the experiment, called Metro Post, is starting out small, it also comes at a time when the world's largest online retailer might be looking for a lot of trucks and a lot of drivers who can do same-day delivery cheap.
Amazon's strategy for consumer domination includes erecting million-square-foot warehouses near the country's largest cities. The company has played coy on whether its expanding physical infrastructure signals plan to offer same-day delivery on a wide scale. If so, it will still need a transportation infrastructure to go along with it.
And that fleet can't just consist of UPS trucks that Amazon tells to go faster. Same-day delivery requires a fundamentally different logistical framework from its standard system, logistics experts say. To get orders delivered even as quickly as overnight, Amazon pulls together the orders at its distribution centers before turning the packages over to UPS or FedEx. The carriers then feed those packages into their own logistics operations, which typically means traveling to UPS or FedEx distribution centers and depots before heading out on trucks to people's houses.
All of that transit doesn't move fast enough for same-day. To make same-day work, the orders must travel straight from the distribution centers to customers.
Of course, Amazon could hatch plans with UPS and FedEx to offer same-day. Unlike those two companies, however, which both have thriving businesses doing what they already do, the USPS has drivers with fewer letters to deliver and a desperate need to innovate. According to the optimistic logic of the so-called sharing economy, that seemingly dire scenario doesn't look like a problem; it looks like idle capacity just waiting to be leveraged.
According to Friess, the Postal Service wouldn't need to hire new drivers or buy more trucks to offer same-day, Friess says. The agency would simply have to adjust where its drivers were going and when.
"We already have the existing infrastructure in place," they say. "That's what sets us apart."
The postal service still has miles to go before becoming Amazon's courier of choice. The pilot program is limited to delivering a maximum of 200 packages per day to customers of 1-800-Flowers.com's sister brands, which sell popcorn, cookies, chocolate and gift baskets. Friess says the USPS is planning to add more retailers soon. If the test is successful, which they say the agency believes it will be, Metro Post will roll out to other large markets across the country.
Friess declined to speculate on whether the USPS' 214,000 trucks – what the agency calls the world's largest civilian fleet – could end up in the service of Amazon.
But they said they believed the USPS will start to look increasingly attractive to other companies exploring the same-day option: "We'd never close the door on ways to expand our revenue."
Video shows Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbing Michelle Fields Embed  Copy Share       Play Video 0:34 The Jupiter, Fla. police department released a video that appears to show Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, grabbing Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Lewandowski was charged with battery by police on March 29. (Jupiter Police Department)
Florida officials have decided not to prosecute Donald Trump's campaign manager Florida officials have decided not to prosecute Donald Trump's campaign manager Corey Lewandowski for grabbing and yanking a reporter away from the candidate at a press conference last month, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg announced Thursday afternoon.
Aronberg, a Democrat, says that their office reviewed the facts of the March 8 incident at Trump's golf club in Jupiter, Fla., and concluded that the reporter — Michelle Fields, who then worked for Breitbart News — infiltrated a protective bubble around the presidential candidate and "brushed or touched Mr. Trump's arm," prompting the candidate to "pull their arm back and away from her." Although a nearby Secret Service agent did not feel the need to distance Fields from Trump, campaign manager Corey Lewandowski "grabbed Ms. Fields' arm, pulling them away from Mr. Trump," Aronberg said. Lewandowski was charged with one misdemeanor count of battery on March 29.
"It's our belief that, what we saw in the video, that any contact was incidental," Aronberg said, explaining that prosecuting someone for simple battery would require "intentional and unwanted touching." Although there was probable cause for police to charge Lewandowski, Aronberg said prosecutors did not have the grounds to further pursue the case.
Aronberg noted that Lewandowski had originally denied that they had touched Fields, even though video from Trump's surveillance cameras clearly shows contact between the two. They said they have encouraged Lewandowski to apologize for what happened, although that was not a condition of the case being dropped, and said that Lewandowski's attorney had shown them a draft of an apology. The state's attorney noted that had the campaign manager apologized at the time of the incident, authorities might not have had to get involved.
"I think that had an apology been given at the beginning of all this, we could have avoided the whole criminal justice process for this matter," Aronberg said.
The Trump campaign released a statement Thursday afternoon that said: "Corey Lewandowski is gratified by the decision to drop the misdemeanor charge and appreciates the thoughtful consideration and professionalism by the Palm Beach State Attorney and their staff who carefully reviewed this matter, as well as Mr. Trump's loyalty and the support of their colleagues and family during this time. The matter is now concluded."
Fields has yet to respond to a request for comment. On Twitter on Wednesday night, they expressed frustration that the state's attorney's office leaked the news to the media before informing them At that point, they had yet to receive an apology.

Throughout this process, Trump has stood by their campaign manager and aggressively questioned Fields's version of the events and motives. Aronberg said that Trump themselves reached out to the prosecutors to share their version of what happened in a conference call a "couple weeks ago." Prosecutors did not interview Lewandowski, although they did communicate with their attorney.
"[Trump] gave their version of the facts and their opinion of the case and then urged us to do the right thing," Aronberg said. "The version of the facts was that they touched them and, pretty much, that's it. That they touched him, and they did not think that Mr. Lewandowski should be prosecuted for it."
During the news conference, a reporter asked Aronberg if Trump had in any way threatened him.
"I don't remember any such threat," Aronberg said. "I can tell you that the conversation we had with Mr. Trump had no bearing upon our final decision on this case. ... What did have the sole bearing on our decision were the facts of this case and the law."

The Old National Bank/Ball State University 2017 Hoosier Survey finds 41 percent of those surveyed in Indiana, the home state of Vice President Pence, approve of the job Trump is doing, while 45 percent disapprove.
“These survey results add to the evidence that the president's approval has slipped a great deal since January,” Chad Kinsella, assistant professor of political science and survey analyst at the Bowen Center for Public Affairs, told the IndyStar.

The poll finds, however, that 77 percent of Republicans surveyed approve of the job Trump is doing.
The poll, which was released Monday, was conducted from Oct. 2 to 15 among 600 people in Indiana. The margin of error is 5.3 percentage points.
In the 2016 election, Trump won Indiana by about 19 points.

In that survey, Trump had a 38 percent job approval rating, down from 42 percent last month. Their disapproval rating was at 57 percent.
Since last week's announcement that J.J. Abrams would be directing the hotly anticipated film Star Wars Episode VII, everyone's been wondering, “What happened?” After the film was first revealed, Abrams was asked if he'd be interested in helming and they said “No.” Fast forward a few weeks and now the director of Star Trek is heading to a galaxy far, far away.
The main reason for Abrams' change of heart was Kathleen Kennedy, the head of LucasFilm. In an new interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kennedy explains in detail how they went about persuading the director the make the movie, which included long, secret meetings at Bad Robot with screenwriter Michael Arndt and consultant Lawrence Kasdan.
Read the full story below, which includes Kennedy's admission that the film's 2015 release date isn't set in stone.
The Hollywood Reporter has an in-depth profile on Kennedy that starts with their latest work at LucasFilm and moves along into their incredibly diverse and eclectic history. It's a great read and you can check it all out at that link. Here's a brief excerpt about Abrams, as written by THR reporter Kim Masters:
Kennedy already had called Beth Swofford, Abrams' CAA agent, and been told Abrams was too deeply engaged in the next Star Trek movie and other obligations at Paramount — not to mention innumerable television projects — to consider the job. Nonetheless, Abrams agreed to meet with Kennedy on Dec. 14 at their Bad Robot offices in Santa Monica. Famously plain-spoken, they summarize their pitch like this: “Please do Star Wars.” And they had cards to play. Not only was Oscar winner Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine, Toy Story 3) writing the script, but Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote 1980's The Empire Strikes Back and 1983's Return of the Jedi, was on board to consult. Abrams “was flipping out when they found out that Michael and Larry were on the movie already,” says Kennedy. Abrams tells THR, “I learned firsthand how incredible and persuasive they are.” Some — but not all — of their reservations were dispelled. “The thing about any pre-existing franchise — I'd sort of done that,” they say. “But when I met with Kathy, it was suddenly very tantalizing.” Kennedy, Abrams and the writers met secretly for about three hours Dec. 19, and “J.J. was just on the ceiling when I walked out the door,” they recall. But still, they say, Abrams had “very genuine concerns” about their obligations elsewhere and the impact on their wife and three kids, given the likelihood that the film would not be shot in Los Angeles. And then there was the unique nature of the franchise. “If there was any pause on J.J.'s part, it was the same pause everybody has — including myself — stepping into this,” they say. “Which is, it's daunting.” Indeed, the six-Star Wars films have grossed more than $4.3 billion at the worldwide box office and spawned an empire that includes TV spinoffs like The Clone Wars, books, theme park rides and, of course, merchandise sales. Disney has said Lucasfilm generated about $215 million in licensing revenue in 2012 without having released a Star Wars-related movie in five years. Managed correctly, Star Wars by far is the most valuable franchise in Hollywood, making Kennedy — its new flight attendant — one of the most powerful figures in entertainment. So Kennedy had to do what they do so well: put one of the industry's most prominent directors at ease. And she's known Abrams since they were 14, when Spielberg had read an article about them winning a Super 8 moviemaking contest and hired the future director to restore their own childhood Super 8 videos. “We spent a lot of time talking about how meaningful Star Wars is and the depth of the mythology that George has created and how we carry that into the next chapter,” they say. Finally, after a day of furious negotiation, the deal closed the afternoon of Jan. 25. To the bitter end, Abrams was telling associates that they still aren't fully committed to directing the project. But Kennedy is confident that they will be in the chair when the cameras roll.  They are less clear that the first film in the new trilogy will be ready by 2015. “Our goal is to move as quickly as we can, and we'll see what happens,” says Kennedy. “The timetable we care about is getting the story.”
What do you think about this story? Are you happy Kennedy pushed so hard? Do you understand Abrams' trepidation? Will Star Wars Episode VII be released in 2015?

So far we have seen 8-bit style box artwork , soundtrack remixes , and even an early stage Sega Master System port , but Newgrounds user ‘ UnrealCanine ‘ is the first person to actually create a full-blown Half-Life 8-bit remake, or rather, a ‘demake'.
The 8-bit ‘demake', referentially entitled ‘Radioactive-Decay‘ was released on January 26, 2015 as an Adobe Flash Player game and spans the first four main chapters of Half-Life, titled respectively as ‘Divergent Substances‘, ‘Unexpected Repercussions‘, ‘Admin System‘, and ‘Tango Spotted!‘ Sound familiar?
Radioactive-Decay features even more nods to the original game; the main character, Jordan Feynman, works in a high-security research facility in New Mexico, called Mount Noire. When the Resonance Cascade occurs, they are given the task of reaching the ‘Sigma Team'. What's more, the game's motto is ‘Race! Consider! Fire! Survive!‘ Even the music, composed by Rasmus Ohlin, resembles Half-Life's tracks. All of which give the game a Gang Garrison 2 like feeling.
Here are some screenshots of some of the levels:
The controls are rather simple: use the W, A, S and D keys to move, O to interact with buttons, doors, scientists or Barneys, P to shoot, and Backspace to alternate between your weapons. Be cautious when choosing your arm though, since backspace works as a back button in some browsers, clicking it when the game's windows isn't active may give you an unpleasant surprise. Good thing your progress is autosaved quite often… right? While the old builds of Radioactive-Decay seemed to have trouble continuing the game after a restart, making it unplayable, this function has apparently been fixed. You can also load a specific chapter directly from the main menu, using D to choose the one you want.
Various hazards in the form of lasers, tripmines, sentries, HECU marines, Headcrabs, Houndeyes and other enemies make the game quite difficult, especially during the last chapter. What's also interesting is that Radioactive-Decay also features the cut Panther Eye enemy. Your arsenal includes the iconic crowbar, 9mm pistol, shotgun, submachine gun and grenades.
Radioactive-Decay is a pretty fun game to play if you have half an hour to spare.
You can play the first part, Radioactive-Decay: Day 1 over on Newgrounds.com.
According to the ending screen, it's apparently not the end of Jordan's adventures though as UnrealCanine has also revealed screenshots of some of the next chapters – Blast Pit and On A Rail. Stay tuned!

A baby seal gave a Tauranga woman the shock of their life when it fumbled its way through their cat door and cuddled up on the couch.
"I was looking at it thinking, it's got flippers, it's not a cat or a dog ... I thought I was hallucinating," said Annette Swoffer, who found the pup on Sunday.
It crashed its way through the cat door and up into their kitchen, where Swoffer discovered it hanging out with the cats.
Not knowing quite what to do, they called a friend to come and look.
"I said to them 'what's that?' and they said 'a seal' so I know I wasn't having a stroke or something."
Swoffer said at first they though the cats had brought in a rabbit, or perhaps the noise was an intruder. But they knew it was something different when the dog didn't react.
"I got a shock. It's kind of like finding an elephant in your house," they said.
The baby fur seal, however, was not perturbed.
It waddled its way into the lounge and onto the couch, where it then took a nap.
"It got itself quite comfortable. I wanted to pat it because it was just so beautiful but I knew you aren't supposed to touch wild animals," Swoffer said.
"Apparently they have a very vicious bite and are quite toxic so I'm glad I didn't."
Swoffer called the SPCA, who called the Department of Conservation, who were already looking for a seal reported ambling along Welcome Bay Rd.
Biodiversity programme manager Chris Clark arrived to remove the young pup and release them back into the water.
They told the Bay of Plenty times he'd spent the afternoon catching what was likely the same seal after it wandered along the Devonport Rd area.
Clark said the pup had probably just weaned from its mother.
They said anyone who encountered a seal, or other wild animal, should call the DOC hotline 0800 DOC HOT before emergency services.
Swoffer, meanwhile, said they believed the seal would be back.
"I'm just waiting to see if it comes flopping back up the driveway."
Can Mild Ale Make it in America? All About Beer Magazine - Volume , Issue Jeff Alworth
Alistair Reece is a peripatetic Scot currently living in Virginia, and a bit of a contrarian. “My dad used to tell me as a kid that ‘if it's easy, it's not worth it,' and anyone can advocate for super hoppy strong ales when they are 10 a penny.” So of course he's championing mild ale, a style so obscure many Americans have never encountered it in the wild. Each year, the United Kingdom's Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) promotes mild ale in May, and Reece decided to launch American Mild Month to run concurrently on this side of the Atlantic. “Mild is such a rare beast that I wanted to give if it's own moment in the spotlight.”
Rare this beast is—even in England. Mild was, as recently as the 1960s, the best-selling style in Britain. (Just after World War II, it had a staggering 70 percent market share.) Bitters finally supplanted them in 1968, and milds went through a precipitous drop in popularity, bottoming out at around 1 percent of the market. It got so bad that CAMRA created Milds in May to promote the style. Ales have made a booming recovery in the U.K., but stronger, hoppier beers are leading the resurgence, and milds look out of step with the times, even there.
Recently, the Guardian published what amounted to an obituary for the style, arguing, “Tastes have changed. People have moved on. Mild looks destined to wither away. … During Mild Month, CAMRA encourages pubs to carry at least one mild, but the idea it will ever return as a regular feature feels farcical. Tastes are heading in the opposite direction. Modern beer drinkers crave flavour—trying to hold back that tide back seems pointless, retrograde even.”
And that's what they're saying in England.
But hold on. There's a countervailing trend in the U.S. toward smaller beer, led by the rapid growth in “Session IPAs.” Furthermore, the “traditional” British mild is actually vastly different from milds of earlier centuries, so we can't foreclose the possibility of further adaptation. What Reece proposes is not the manufacture and sale of extinct curiosities, but something living, speaking with an American accent. “Part of the project has been to encourage brewers to create an ‘American Mild' style using American ingredients,” Reece explained. “So while I love the traditional dark mild, I am happy to try new things within the style as well.”
All About Mild
Let's back up and look at that nearly-extinct curiosity struggling to survive in Britain. From the 1700s through to the early 20th century, a mild was any beer served fresh, rather than aged (or “stale”). Ales aged in casks picked up the characteristic flavors of Brettanomyces, which the young ales lacked. The word “mild” could apply to any beer, light or dark, weak or strong (and a lot of them were quite strong), so long as it was un-aged. It was an adjective more than a style.
Modern milds developed as a consequence of two events. The first, in 1880, was a change in the law that allowed brewers to use sugar and adjuncts in beer. Then came the world wars, rationing, tax hikes and what came to be known as the “great gravity drop,” as ales made do on far slighter grists. Milds, typically dark, weak (3% to 3.5%), and, well, mild-tasting, emerged after Hitler's fall and slaked the thirst of the war generation.
They declined in the 1970s in part because they seemed out of fashion and in part because they were made very cheaply, but then enjoyed a quality renaissance when the first wave of small breweries started arriving in the 1970s and 1980s. (Unlike modern British “craft breweries,” these earlier pioneers made classic cask ales.) One of the practitioners of quality mild is John Boyce, founder of Essex's Mighty Oak Brewing. Their Oscar Wilde Mild has won the mild category twice and in 2011 won Champion Beer of Britain, the country's highest laurel.
Boyce believes good milds should be made with quality malts and no sugar. “Milds are predominantly dark colored beers,” they say, outlining the style. “They usually use black malt to build some burnt/malt flavor to make up for the low bitterness.” The malts should layer in flavor, and the hops, “traditional English varieties such as Goldings, Fuggles, Challenger,” should round out the flavor profile, making a classic British cask tipple. Boyce's is stronger than most milds (but still just 3.7%), and when it won champion beer, judges said it had a “great depth of character, and for the style has a lot of hop bitterness as well.”
Milds may be a niche style in Britain, but at breweries like Mighty Oak they manage to become flagship brands. The Guardian's opinion notwithstanding, there's no reason to think characterful examples of mild won't find an audience in Britain.
American Mild?
That can't be said for the U.S., though. Milds still fall (barely) within the British palate, but even great beers like Boyce's are well outside America's. They start out with three strikes against them: 1) they're weaker even than light beer, 2) they're mostly dark, and 3) they depend on an appreciation of subtle flavors. Americans are warming to session beers, but anything below 4% isn't going to fly unless it's intense. Dark beers are on the wane in the age of hops, and Americans love strong, vivid flavors. So while a Berliner weisse (super-low alcohol, but super-high flavor) or a session IPA (low alcohol, high hops) might make it, English-style milds are doomed.
But could they be Americanized just enough to creep into our preferred palate? What if you dialed down the color a notch or two to something between an amber and a brown, added a specialty malt or three (oats, rye, or something curious like buckwheat, spelt, or quinoa), and added the requisite level and type of American hopping? Would a dark amber oatmeal mild, dry-hopped with Citra, sell in the U.S.? And perhaps as relevantly, would an amber oatmeal Citra mild still qualify as a mild? (Color Reece skeptical. “Just because Citra tastes great doesn't mean Citra is all I want to taste in my beer.”)
I'm willing to see boundaries stretched. While I love a proper English mild, I think I'd really enjoy this oatmeal Citra mild, too. Styles survive when they evolve with the times—and they die off when they stick needlessly to tradition. (Had any good Cöpenicker Moll lately?) I have no idea if Americans and milds can come to a meeting of the minds, but I'd like to see them try. Alistair Reece has managed to coax 48 breweries into making a mild for this inaugural Mild Month, which seems like a decent proof of concept. I hope others join in, and I hope even more come back next year and try their hand at a mild.
(Extra credit to anyone willing to try a dark amber, oatmeal Citra mild.)

It is difficult to imagine Roy Hodgson learnt too much about their England side from a disappointing friendly. The most interesting area of the side, however, was in central midfield, where Hodgson fielded Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and James Milner.
Republic of Ireland v England: five talking points Read more
Wilshere occupied the deepest role, the position they have often played for England since the retirement of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard after last summer's World Cup. While sometimes this has been as part of a midfield diamond, here it was at the base of a triangle in a 4-3-3.
Wilshere was usually the English midfielder in space, and took advantage of this freedom to shuttle forward in possession, typically looking for quick one-twos with players in more advanced positions. A couple of these sudden darts offered rare moments of excitement, and there was also a superb diagonal ball towards Ryan Bertrand's overlapping run midway through the first half.
Wilshere's tendency to storm forward meant one of the other midfielders dropped in to cover. Henderson and Milner – now Liverpool team-mates – showed good understanding holding their position as England's midfield trio temporarily flipped, and it has become increasingly common to see such fluidity from Hodgson's side. For a manager who has generally based their teams around structured formations and two banks of four, it marks a significant change in approach.
Republic of Ireland 0-0 England: how Roy Hodgson's players rated Read more
That fluidity is vital considering Wilshere, Henderson and Milner are not naturals together in a midfield trio. They are reasonably similar footballers, box-to-box midfielders who primarily offer the ability to get up and down the pitch regularly. Ideally one would be used in conjunction with a genuine playmaker and a natural defensive midfielder, but England lack options in the centre.
Defensively, they are not perfect. All three like to press opponents, which can be useful: Henderson's closing down created England's best chance, early in the second half, when they dispossessed Marc Wilson then squared for Wayne Rooney, whose horrendous first touch bobbled into the arms of the Ireland goalkeeper Keiren Westwood.
But with even Wilshere always wanting to move up the pitch into challenges, England's defence wasn't protected as keenly as Hodgson would have liked. A more disciplined, experienced holding player such as Michael Carrick, unavailable through injury, would provide more support for the defence.
This will be particularly important against opposition of a higher quality in a more high-tempo match– especially teams playing with quality attacking midfielders. The trip to Slovenia next Sunday, against a team possessing genuine midfield creativity in the shape of Fiorentina's Josip Ilicic and Dortmund's Kevin Kampl, will be a tougher test.
The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has issued a warning to White House social media director Dan Scavino for using Twitter to interfere with an election.
The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed a complaint with the OSC after Scavino called for the primary election defeat of Trump critic Rep. Justin Amash Justin AmashHouse to push back at Trump on border Ex-GOP lawmakers urge Republicans to block Trump's emergency declaration This week: Congress, Trump set for showdown on emergency declaration MORE (R-Mich.) on Twitter, claiming their actions violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits many government employees from taking part in campaign activities.

“Mr. Scavino has been advised that if in the future they engage in prohibited political activity, while employed in a position covered by the Hatch Act, we will consider such activity to be a willful and knowing violation of the law,” a letter from the OSC to CREW this week reads.
“The rules are clear that government officials aren't allowed to use their position for campaign activity,” CREW Executive Director Noah Bookbinder said in a statement Friday.
“OSC has made clear with this ruling that they are going to enforce these important rules and work to keep the government free from inappropriate politics,” they said.
The White House said Scavino immediately responded to the OSC's concerns and cooperated with the counsel. The administration also said they have worked with the Office of the White House Counsel to ensure that the Hatch Act is being followed.

The Imam of the Hala Sultan Tekke mosque in Larnaca proves a prickly customer as they stand up for the rights of Muslims in Cyprus. THEO PANAYIDES meets them
Imam Shakir Alemdar is just about fed up with the present government. The previous government was better, they insist, sitting in their office at the Hala Sultan Tekke, the beautiful mosque just across the road from the old Larnaca Airport. Mr. Sylikiotis, in the days when they were Minister of the Interior, came to a reception on the Prophet Muhammad's birthday and gave a lovely speech. But the present government has proved un-supportive and un-cooperative. Imam Shakir asked to see the President six months ago, to congratulate them on their appointment, but received no reply; as for the current Minister of the Interior, “I don't believe I will ever see him”.
Yet “I am a major person in this republic,” they tell me, their temper rising. The Imam is a shrewd, courteous man, but they do have a tendency to rant. “I'm representing the Mufti's office, I am a mufti and I am Turkish Cypriot Muslim clergy. Why are you ignoring me? I did not expect them to ignore me, honestly.
“Show me you are supporting us,” they go on, as if the island's politicians were standing in their smallish office, the silence outside broken only by the distant sounds of tourists roaming the grounds. “You don't want me? This is the question I am asking. Do you think I am too much? Well, if you think I am too much, open your Constitution. And you will see if I am too much or not”. They were expecting more open-mindedness, they sigh, more understanding. Instead, “to be honest with you, I find them still 50 years back. This government, I find is still 50 years backwards”.
‘Is this off the record?' I ask, surprised by their vehemence. ‘Or can I mention it?'
“You can mention it,” they reply simply. “I am not saying anything wrong. I have not seen any move from the government, neither from the President nor from the Interior Ministry. Because we are an important part of the Cyprus Republic,” they go on, getting increasingly agitated. “Yet you are choosing to ignore me? Sorry, you cannot ignore me. I mean, what are you going to do? Hang me? Kill me? Wipe me out? I-am-part-of-this-island!” they cry, emphasising each word in turn. “I am Cypriot! You cannot ignore me!
“Why, as President, you didn't open up your mouth and say ‘Happy Eid, happy Bayram'? Huh? Why not? Barack Obama, the American President, said it. The American Ambassador sent me a celebration for Ramadan. And yet, yet, yet…” They shake their head disapprovingly. “As President of Cyprus, you are not only president for the Greek Cypriots, you are president of the Muslims as well. You should have opened your mouth and said ‘Happy Eid, celebration of Ramadan, for our Muslim citizens'. Did they say that? I didn't see it.”
It is indeed Bayram, the day after the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting and contemplation having obviously honed Imam Shakir's appetite for argument. Their anger is at odds with our surroundings – because the Hala Sultan Tekke is a very serene place, perched in a clump of trees on the edge of a salt lake. In winter, the lake fills up and it looks like Switzerland; in summer it looks like the surface of another planet, an implacable vista of salt which the locals used to harvest on picturesque donkeys back in the old days.
There are 110 mosques in Cyprus (eight of them open for worship) but this is by far the most important. Wikipedia quotes various sources claiming it's the third- or fourth-holiest place for Muslims in the world, though Imam Shakir dismisses such crude list-making – but it's certainly, they say, the holiest Muslim site in Europe. The mosque contains the tomb of Umm Haram, the Prophet's aunt, who died in 647 but still appears in visions to the faithful. “This is a very well-known phenomenon, you know, having spiritual visions of them It happens to us as well, many times.”
Really? It's happened to them personally?
“Yeah, many times.” He'll sometimes see them on the first or second night of Ramadan, when they start praying. “I see her, like, welcoming us at the entrance. I see them figure, their dress, etc.” Just a fleeting vision, they explain, like an image appearing in time-lapse. “Many people see them Many people see them in a dream as well. She's very… uh, active,” they add, searching for the right word. “She's very active.”
That, coincidentally, is also the word to describe the Imam himself. They lead an active lifestyle, being a sporty chap as well as a devout Muslim. They love fishing, sailing, kayaking, the sea in general. They do archery (of all things). They like going camping with their family – they and their wife have two daughters, 21 and 15, the elder now studying in the UK – likes going off-road and exploring “uncharted places”. And of course he's even more active in their work, being the type (I suspect) who's very hard to shake when they want something. “I started here five years ago, 2008,” they say, “and since then we've covered a lot of distance with the authorities. There has been much progress. But of course there are still many things that need to be fixed”.
The main thing is access. The Republic of Cyprus views the Tekke as an ancient monument, so it's only open during museum hours. This is not right, says the Imam hotly, “because the people who use it are alive. I mean, we are not fossils, you know? You cannot make a place that I use a museum”. At the moment, the doors open at 8.30am and close at 5.30pm in winter, 7.30 in summer (an exception was made during Ramadan, with a midnight extension for night-time prayers); thus, the Imam can only perform two of the five daily prayers required of Muslims, missing the sunset prayer, evening prayer (9.30pm) and morning prayer (5am). “I keep telling them ‘Listen, I have an obligation',” they explain plaintively. “‘I cannot follow the museum hours'.”
The battle is ongoing. There's now an official sign at the entrance to the Tekke, warning tourists that “this is a place of worship” and asking them to dress respectfully – a welcome acknowledgment of the mosque's status as a mosque. On the other hand, right in the middle of Imam Shakir's office is a hole, about eight feet deep, covered with a sheet of plexiglass: the Antiquities Department carried out an excavation in 2002, saying they'd found an ancient settlement “in order to claim it's a museum. No. This is illegal”. He's happy for the mosque to be listed as a monument and tourist attraction, they explain – but it should be like Kykko Monastery, where the busloads of tourists don't prevent the monks from doing what monks have to do.
Yet there's also a larger – and more frustrating – issue: the fact that they feel he's being treated as part of the Cyprus problem (what they call “the political abnormality”), whereas they have nothing to do with that. “Turks and Greeks, they've done a very bad thing,” they intone: “They have involved – between their Turkish and Greek thing – they have involved Muslim and Christian as well. The conflict is not religious. The conflict is political, it's got nothing to do with my faith”. They have no love for the ‘government' up north, nor do they feel they represent him. They don't even live there, they point out; they live in Nicosia, on the Greek Cypriot side, their car is registered there and their children go to school there. As for the thorny issue of reciprocity, the Imam's position is clear: “Any church in the north should be accessible for Christians. 100 per cent, I agree with this… Military zone or not, I don't care. Church is a church, mosque is a mosque. You should give freedom to this. But the politicians, they have hijacked this”.
Their own official title is Representative of the Grand Mufti of Cyprus in the Republic of Cyprus (the Grand Mufti themselves is a Turk, whereas our Constitution calls for a Turkish Cypriot) – and of course Imam of Hala Sultan Tekke, the first in decades after the last Imam was forced out by the troubles. “Hala Sultan is empty,” lamented their spiritual master Sheikh Nazim – the 91-year-old Sufi who lives in Lefka and runs various centres in the UK – and Imam Shakir came back from London on a personal quest, to “look after my heritage” and restore the holy shrine to its full glory.
They lived in London for 18 years, trained by Nazim's organisation (who also introduced them to their wife). At the Tekke, their sermons are usually in English. “Our approach is very un-traditional,” they insist. “Very humanitarian, very universal”; the centres are playfully known as “United Colours of Sheikh Nazim”, because they attract Sufis from all over the world and every nation gets a differently-coloured turban. “I don't have traditional Islamic education,” they explain. “My family is extremely secular”. They were born in Kyrenia 45 years ago, their dad a civil servant, their mother a housewife (“very nice people, beautiful people”); they went off to study Physics but had meanwhile started “questioning life” as they put it, and found the answers in Islam. “The message is pure. And it feeds us. It feeds my soul and my heart very, very efficiently.”
Couldn't they find the same satisfaction in a non-religious way?
“Some people have a hunger for spirituality,” they reply. “Like some people love the sea”. Some people don't, and there's nothing you can say to convince them. “This is a state of the soul. For me, from birth, I have been hungry for spirituality. And I am the only one in my family like this.”
Their parents and siblings remain quite secular. Their wife wears traditional hijab, but their daughters don't and he'd never force them. “To be a devoted Muslim or not, it's up to them,” they insist. “We are open-minded. We are a very free family. But we have standards”. Having ‘standards' does impose some restrictions: he'd never go on holiday to Ayia Napa, for instance. “Because religion don't support craziness. Religion don't support drunkenness”. Still, it all sounds quite civilised, a “European attitude” as they like to say – and a far cry from the public perception of Islam, I point out, inevitably triggering another rant.
“Taliban?” fumes Imam Shakir, taking a sip of their coffee (it's hot but they drink it from a glass, in the Middle Eastern style). Suicide bombings? Kidnappings? “What is this? My religion is not giving me such an order.” You have one billion peaceful Muslims in the world, they hector, “so why show extremism as representing Islam? No! We are normal people. We eat, we drink, we laugh, we cry. We have neighbours. We have lived with Greek Cypriots, we live with British. We are normal people. We don't have guns, we don't have Kalashnikovs. What is this? These people, they just come down from the mountains and hijack religion. We don't accept this… How can Taliban represent me? I have thousands of years of heritage. I have thousands of years of civilisation. It's an insult.”
Yes – but maybe their “European attitude” doesn't represent many Muslims either.
“I don't give a toss about that!” they reply, 18 years of North London coming out unexpectedly. “I don't care. Because we want Islam to be presented peacefully.”
You see a lot of that when you talk to Imam Shakir – the reckless passion that ‘doesn't give a toss' about naysayers, the self-assurance (maybe even arrogance) that's equally insulted by being associated with Taliban or snubbed by the Minister of the Interior. There's no doubt he's a prickly customer. Still, the agenda he's pursuing – to extract religious matters from the fearsome maw of the Cyprus problem – is a worthy one, and they clearly have a point: Muslim rights are enshrined in the 1960 Constitution, however battered and threadbare. After all, “Islam is part of Cyprus since the time they came here” (‘she' being the 1500-year-old woman who still appears in visions now and then). “It's not newly introduced. We are here since the 7th Century”.
“This is a place of worship,” they say firmly, with a nod to the serene grounds behind him. “This is a blessed place. I want everyone to come and benefit from it. But first give me my rights. So that I can serve you better”. Ignore them at your peril.
Visit the main blog post (http://bit.ly/azgKeG) for up to the minute updates on the attack.
Over the past few weeks I have been investigating the Anonymous DDoS assault against media authorities around the world. This is small, but vocal Internet community launched an attack campaign called “Operation Payback”, which targeted DDoS attacks against various companies and agencies who support the anti-piracy lobby. This attack, provoked by a similar attack carried out by an Indian firm against file sharing sites, caused the organizers of Anonymous to go nearly mental in rage. Monitoring their communications over the past few weeks reminded me of the 1976 scene from the movie “Network”, where Peter Finch gets everyone to yell out of their windows, saying “I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!”
Recruiting fliers (pictured below) were posted all around the world in multiple languages. Sites like Reddit, Digg, 4chan, and Twitter were used to encourage thousands of people from all around the world to join in, stand up, and attack the anti-piracy lobby.
During my investigation, I got the chance to speak with some of the Anonymous organizers in a Q&A session. Here is the result of that chat:
Q: Who is Anonymous?
A: I believe it is just a description of what we are. Anonymous is not an organization with hierarchy and leaders. We manifest as Anarchy. We are comprised of people from all walks of life. In short, we feel strongly motivated to do what we can to fight back against things which are morally questionable.
Q: What is your current mission?
A: To fight back against the anti-piracy lobby. There been a massive lobbyist-provoked surge in unfair infringements of personal freedom online, lately. See the Digital Economy Bill in the UK, and “three strikes” legislation in the EU which both threaten to disconnect internet connections based on accusations supplied by the music and movie industries. In the USA, a new bill has been proposed that could allow the USA to force top level registrars such as ICANN and Nominet to shut down websites, all with NO fair trial. Guilty until proven guilty! Our tactics are inspired by the very people who provoked us, AiPlex Software. A few weeks back they admitted to attacking file sharing sites with DDoS attacks.
We recommend reading our official statement here: http://pastebin.com/kD52Af4N
Q: Do you advocate piracy?
A: Yes. It is the next step in a cultural revolution of shared information. Imagine it as the beginnings to an information singularity; a beginning of true “equality of opportunity”, regardless of wealth or capacity. I would not have gotten anywhere near my accomplishments today without the books I pirated. I can't afford them!
Q: What websites have you attacked?
A: The Motion Picture Association of America [MPAA], The Recording Industry Association of America [RIAA], The British Phonographic Industry [BPI], The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft [AFACT] ,Stichting Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland [BREIN], ACS:Law, Aiplex, Websheriff, and Dglegal.
Q: Your original poster mentioned that “botnets” would be used in this attack. Do any of you profit from cyber crime?
A: That depends on if you're using the anti-piracy lobby definition of cyber criminal or not. To be clear, we do not condone any sort of profit from botnets or malware for that matter, but the vast majority of what is constituted as Cyber Crime can be something as simple as downloading your favourite song, instead of paying ridiculous fees for that song (which the artist will only see a fraction of).
Q: What's your affiliation with 4chan? Are you all active members?
A: Some of us frequent 4chan, but we have no affiliation with any forum or website for that matter. We simply use them to communicate.
Q: How long will this attack go on for?
A: There is no time frame. We will keep going until we stop being angry.
Q: Are you prepared to go to jail for your cause?
A: Yes, but we've taken every measure we can to make sure that our anonymity remains in tact. More importantly, why isn't this question asked to the very people who hired Aiplex to attack us in the first place?
Q: If you were able to resolve this situation, what would you want the respective media authorities of the world to do?
A: Personally, I would want them to basically go the fuck away altogether. Remove the barbaric laws they have lobbied for. Treat people like PEOPLE instead of criminals. Their long outdated traditional views on copyright infringement enforced solely by rich and powerful corporations need to be modified in light of the modern age on the Internet, the Information Age.
Artists under the media conglomerates have very little say in the content they produce and make a fraction of the profit. This is fairly evident with several mainstream artists who've now defected from the media regimes control. Take Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead as two great examples. Both groups have embraced piracy and have still continued to make a significant profit for themselves.
Q: Are you aware that this sort of attack is illegal in many countries and that your group can potentially put innocent people who support your cause under legal scrutiny?
A: I think that most people/participants are aware of that risk. In a world where our voice is ignored we feel we have no choice but to revert to direct action.
Q: Some people view this as the future of protests. Do you foresee future protests like this for other causes in the future?
A: Certainly. As for the protests, I hope the future of protests is ACTION. Not walking in circles with useless signs that are ignored.
Osama Bin Laden wore a COWBOY HAT to avoid detection from U.S. drones, reveals secret report into their life on the run
The terror chief was almost caught shortly after the 9/11 attack, said the wife of one of their guards, when their car was stopped for speeding
Bin Laden was in the habit of wearing a cowboy hat in their Abbottabad compound because they thought it would shield them from U.S. drones
They spent their last night with their youngest wife, and the two initially thought the noise from approaching Chinook helicopters was just a rainstorm
A Pakistani government commission decided that killing bin Laden was an act of 'murder' - and that they were a 'victim'
Bin Laden was so secretive about their compound that they and their followers waited until after an earthquake to add a third story to the house
Dr. Shakeel Afridi, now imprisoned in Pakistan for helping the U.S., wasn't arrested for three weeks following the raid, allowing the CIA time to help them escape if U.S. officials had wanted to help them
One of bin Laden's relatives said they often wore a cowboy hat to avoid detection by U.S. drones. Pictured - how the terror leader might have looked in a stetson
A secret Pakistani report leaked online on Monday provides a series of stunning revelations about the life and death of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden, the long-time Al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 9/11 attacks against the United States in 2001.
The report, placed online by the Al Jazeera news network, recounts the testimony of more than 200 witnesses including bin Laden's family members.
On one occasion during 2002 or 2003, bin Laden was almost caught while headed to a market with their security guard Ibrahim al-Kuwaiti and the guard's wife Maryam . The car they were riding in - it's unclear who was driving - was pulled over for speeding, but bin Laden 'quickly settled the matter,' according to Maryam's testimony, and the al-Qaeda leader was once again off and running.
One of bin Laden's relatives said 'The Shaikh,' as they were known, often 'wore a cowboy hat to avoid detection from above' by overhead U.S. drones, and that 'a complete collapse of local governance' allowed them to hide inside the country for six years before U.S. President Barack Obama gave the order to have them killed in a Navy SEAL raid.
That 'kill mission,' Pakistan's official inquiry declared, was 'a criminal act of murder which was condemned by a number of international lawyers and human rights organizations.'
'Due process was deliberately denied the victims,' the commissioners wrote - referring to bin Laden as a victim - 'and their killing was explicitly ordered by the President of the US.'
The US Navy SEALs raid that killed the al Qaida founder in the town of Abbottabad outraged Pakistani officials because they were not told about it beforehand.
US officials have said they kept Pakistan in the dark because they were worried that bin Laden would be tipped off.
May 2, 2011 marked the end of bin Laden's reign of terror as the leader of al-Qaeda. President Barack Obama announced that the United States had killed the most-wanted terrorist in an operation led by Navy SEALS
The fact that the compound where bin Laden was hiding was located only about half a mile from Pakistan's equivalent of West Point led many in the US to suspect Pakistani officials of aiding him, although Washington never found evidence to back that up.
The report said it also found no evidence that current or former Pakistani officials helped bin Laden hide, although it could not rule it out completely.
It said very little is known about the network of support that bin Laden enjoyed in Pakistan, other than the group of family and backers that lived with them in Abbottabad.
The report attacked all levels of government, including the powerful army and intelligence services, for failing to detect the terror leader as they lived in six different places in Pakistan over nine years.
'To summarise, negligence and incompetence to a greater or lesser degree at almost all levels of government are clear,' said the report, which was based on testimony from more than 200 witnesses, official documents and site visits.
The criticism of the army and intelligence services was noteworthy in a country where officials often steer clear of taking these powerful organisations to task.
The commission recommended the government make the report public for fear it would be ignored or suppressed, but that never happened, even though it was completed months ago.
The report said it was shocking that nobody in the Pakistani government discovered bin Laden while they were living in Abbottabad for six years.
They were in a compound described as 'hardly normal,' because it was isolated from homes around it, had very high walls and was protected by barbed wire.
Did they get the idea from Barack? Bin Laden was in the habit of wearing a cowboy hat in their Abbottabad, Pakistan compound because they believed it would shield their identiiy from U.S drones
Thunderclaps or Chinook helicopters? Bin Laden and their youngest wife reportedly thought at first that the Nave SEAL raid's noises were due to a rainstorm
'The extent of incompetence, to put it mildly, was astounding, if not unbelievable,' the report said.
Among the dozen of new details in the report is the revelation that bin Laden and their supporters waited to build an unauthorized third story on the compound until after a devastating earthquake hit Pakistan in 2005.
According to an account given to the Abbottabad Commission by their wives, with whom they were able to father four children while they were on the run, they often liked to have an apple and a piece of chocolate when they were feeling weak.
The Guardian reports that the terror leader actively encouraged their grandchildren to compete over who could grow the best vegetables.
It also said the children of one of their Pakistani couriers knew them as 'poor uncle'.
The child had reportedly asked why they never went out shopping, and was told they were too poor to buy anything.
Of the raid itself, the commission wrote that bin Laden and their youngest wife Amal were together in the bedroom when the U.S. helicopters first arrived.
'After the evening meal and prayer,' the account reads, 'Amal and the Shaikh retired for the night. Shortly past midnight, they were awakened by the noise of what at first sounded like a storm.'
It wasn't a cloudburst. Minutes later, bin Laden lay dead on the floor.
Scene of the 'murder'? Pakistan's commission decided that killing 'the victim' bin Laden in their compound, pictured, was a criminal act since they were executed without due process in a court of law
In this now-famous photo, White House national security officials and cabinet members watched the SEAL Team Six raid in real-time as then stalked, found and killed Osama bin Laden
The report also explores the case of Dr. Shakeel Afridi, a Pakistani physician who used their position as a public health vaccination volunteer to attempt to be admitted into bin Laden's compound.
Pakistani doctor Shakeel Afridi helped the U. S. track down Osama bin Laden. They were sentenced to 33 years in prison for 'conspiring against the state'
Although they failed to get in, Afridi got a good enough look at the complex system of locks on the front door to help the Navy SEALs design a specialized package of explosives designed to blow the door off.
They also provided their CIA handlers with crucial information about the voices of the people inside the compound.
Aftridi 'met with the CIA operatives [assigned to him] on more than 25 occasions,' the report concludes, 'and received approximately Rs. [Rupees] 10 million from them.
10 million Pakistani Rupees is equal to about $100,000.
The Pakistani government arrested Afridi and they remain in prison, sentenced to more than three decades behind bars. Despite the doctor's key role in the mission's success, the United States has done little to secure their release.
'[T]he fact is that they were arrested 3 weeks after the raid during which time the CIA could have ferreted them out of the country.'
Al Jazeera's release of the commission's report came on the same day the United States government was exposed for going to great lengths to hide its own collection of information related to the 2011 raid.
The alarm of a catastrophic meltdown of the Antarctic cycles up and down every year or two. A journal article says the rate of melt is increasing, the popular press picks up on it and breathlessly warns about huge sea level rises sinking coastal cities around the world. We are told that x number of gigatonnes of ice per year are being dumped off the continent and wreaking their havoc on the world. Then another study says “not so fast,” the mass losses aren't that great after all. Or, some crazy old skeptics ruin all the fun by recklessly bringing some logic to the discussion.
Today we have “Volume loss from Antarctic ice shelves is accelerating” (Paolo, et. al., Science, 2015). The abstract warns us
“Overall, average ice-shelf volume change accelerated from negligible loss at 25 ± 64 km3 per year for 1994-2003 to rapid loss of 310 ± 74 km3 per year for 2003-2012.”
310 km3 per year (roughly the same as 310 gigatonnes per year) is pretty high compared to most other estimates. So you will probably see many references to this number because the bigger and scarier the more the press likes it. But for the more sober minded, consider the following comparison of ice loss estimates from “Ice sheet mass balance and climate change” (Hanna, et. al., Nature, 2013)
How does the recent Science paper compare? If we place it on estimate plots from Hanna's paper it would look like this..
The Paolo Nature paper is an outlier. But lets take them at their word. They say that the Antarctic, on average, shed about 300 more Gigatonnes of ice per year during the 2003 to 2012 period than during the 1994 to 2003 period. Where did all this ice go? In to the oceans, of course. That is why we have the great sea level rise scare.
So it follows that the sea level should have been rising faster during the 2003 to 2012 period than during the 1994 to 2003-year period. How much faster? Well, every gigatonne of water dumped into the oceans raises the sea level by about 2.78 microns. So 300 gigatonnes of extra water per year would raise the sea levels about an extra 840 microns a year, or about an extra 0.84 mm per year. We are told that satellite data indicates that the global sea level is rising about 3 mm per year. 0.84 mm per year is a significant fraction of 3 mm per year, so such a rate increase should really stand out in the sea level rise data..
Well, here is some of that satellite sea level rise data…
This slideshow requires JavaScript.
This discussion has been about ice that is moving from the land to the sea and raising the sea level. But let's take a quick moment to look at the sea ice that surrounds Antarctica. While this ice does not contribute to changes in the sea level, it does say something about the conditions in that area.
Do you see a trend? I see a trend. And I know there are variety of “just-so stories” to explain away this trend, but I am unconvinced.
Conclusion
Between 1994 and 2003 the average sea level rise rate was 3.77 mm/yr, according to satellite data (University of Colorado). If the Antarctic were depositing an average of about 300 more gigatonnes of water in the ocean per year in the following years (2003 to 2012), then the average sea level rise rage from 2003 to 2012 should have increased by about 0.84 m/yr, to 4.61 mm/yr.
Instead, the average sea level rise rate from 2003 to 2012 dropped to 2.66 mm/yr.
The claim of a huge rise in ice loss from the Antarctic over this period is quite implausible.

THE BASICS: San Jose Earthquakes
Western Conference
Home: Avaya Stadium HONORS: MLS CUP: 2001, 2003
Supporters' Shield: 2005, 2012 SJEARTHQUAKES.COM: Tickets
Schedule
Jerseys/Gear
As MLS' only two-time entrant, the San Jose fan base has a bit of a chip on its shoulder after the Quakes left town in 2005. Never the flashiest team, San Jose have embraced their history of outworking opponents -- the kind of attitude that brought the original Quakes MLS titles in 2001 and 2003. The return of former coach Dominic Kinnear represents a link to the Quakes' past, but the club is also ushering in a new era with the opening of Avaya Stadium.
Rivals
With Chivas USA gone, the Quakes and LA Galaxy are MLS' only two remaining California clubs, which should only heighten an already contentious relationship. (As is the case for Bay Area-L.A. showdowns in many sports, this rivalry seems to burn a little hotter for Northern California fans.) The Quakes have also developed a chippy history with Seattle, and they have a potential instant rival as the Dynamo -- the franchise that spirited Kinnear and the Quakes from San Jose in 2005 -- join the Western Conference.
2014 Recap
In a word: dreadful. The Quakes removed the interim tag from coach Mark Watson's title after an 11-5-3 run to finish 2013, but things fell apart in their first full season. Injuries wreaked havoc on an often moribund offense, dogging talented winger Yannick Djalo and knocking out new DP Matias Perez Garcia after just six appearances. Chris Wondolowski sandwiched 14 goals around their World Cup stint, but the Quakes' slide nevertheless culminated in a franchise-record 15-match winless streak and Watson's dismissal.

2015 Prospectus
Kinnear has made significant roster changes since coming over from Houston at the end of last season. Gone are long-time MLS veterans such as Jon Busch, Sam Cronin, Atiba Harris and Jason Hernandez. In terms of replacements, Kinnear and general manager John Doyle focused on speed, nabbing defender Marvell Wynne, midfielders Leandro Barrera and Sanna Nyassi and, perhaps most importantly, forward Innocent Emeghara, a Swiss international who is expected to stretch defenses, creating pockets for Wondolowski to get free. Key questions include whether the center-back pairing of Victor Bernardez and Clarence Goodson can return to form and what playmaker Perez Garcia can do in a full MLS campaign.
CLUB SOURCE: "I don't expect a very wide field in San Jose, even though they have a new stadium. It's going to be a rugged game, in which they're very good on set pieces."
CLUB SOURCE: "In our league, you have to have a couple midfielders who are gonna do the dirty work, but also possess and be clean with the ball, and I'm not sure they have that."
PROJECTED LINEUP: 4-4-2 Bingham; Wynne, Bernardez, Goodson, Stewart; Barrera, Pierazzi, Perez Garcia, Salinas; Wondolowski, Emeghara Complete roster [sjearthquakes.com]
FANTASY SOCCER SLEEPER PICKS: Leandro Barrera
Cordell Cato
JJ Koval Looking for an inexpensive starting goalkeeper? David Bingham ($5m) will finally get their chance between the posts. The back line in front of them is priced to move, but also somewhat injury prone and still settling in under Kinnear. At wide midfield, there are four players for two spots, with only Shea Salinas ($8.5) a safe bet to start. Plus, how will the lineup change when Innocent Emeghara ($9m) is healthy? Who knows, but you can bet on Wondo ($10.5) being in the picture.
Armchair Analyst's Best Case Scenario
New coach, new 'keeper, new DP, maybe an entirely reconstructed midfield... that's a lot of questions for any team heading into any season. Kinnear's track record (and the hope that Goodson and Bernardez stay healthy) should give this team a solid defensive foundation. It's just a matter of putting the pieces together beyond that.
And, well, the pieces don't really seem to fit all that well. Getting Wondo, Emeghara and one of the target forwards all on the field together - remember, Kinnear made re-signing Lenhart a priority and traded for Sherrod - will take a bit of wizardry, as will constructing a central midfield that can balance each other on defense while finding a way to add a bit more in attack. There are a lot of square pegs and round holes to sort through.
Add in the age factor, and just how loaded the Western Conference is, and it feels like a stretch to say this team will compete for a playoff spot.

WAUSAU, WI (WSAU) - Wausau's first Gay Pride Parade is set for June 22nd, but not everyone welcomes the idea.
Parade organizer Daxx Bouvier has said the event is long overdue.  They are putting about 15-thousand dollars into the event, and encouraging young people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender to come out as see there is support.
Groups including Wisconsin Family Voice oppose the parade, saying it's “nothing more than a display of immorality and propaganda” and sends the wrong message to young people.
A city alderman weighed in during the Council's public comment period Tuesday night. 3rd District Alderman David Nutting expressed their opposition to the Gay Pride Parade, and says many of their constituents don't want it.
Nutting says the Gay Pride Parade is inappropriate, and it should not be hosted. They encourage people to not attend the parade, or if you go, turn your back as a sign you don't support them.
Police Chief Jeff Hardel says the department will handle this parade like any other parade. They say they will be looking for inappropriate nudity or exposure, like they would at any other event.
The Gay Pride Parade is planned to go from Marathon Park to the 400 Block in downtown Wausau.

VANCOUVER, B.C. - Today is a very important day from coast to coast as Bell is raising awareness for mental health issues with Bell Let's Talk Day. Mental health issues affects people from all walks of life all over the world. It doesn't matter if you're an athlete, lawyer, teacher or a bin man or woman. Each and all of us most likely know a close friend or family member that has had a tough time with a personal mental health issue. The Vancouver Whitecaps organization are fully behind helping and supporting people who need help with mental health issues. Carl Robinson always backs their players to the hilt and that's no different when it comes to off the pitch situations. "It's important that we support anyone within the club that could do with a little bit of help in relation to making it a little bit more comfortable for them. We're always supportive of our players with health issues." It is often assumed that people playing sports don't have anything to worry about. The make pretty decent money, play sports and travel the world. What kind of problem is that? That's simply not true. The pressure to perform, train, stay healthy and fit is massive. No player wants to lose a place on a team-sheet. The day-to-day grind can take a toll and cause stress for anyone. Whitecaps goalkeeper David Ousted acknowledges some of the pressures footballers can face. "I think it's an issue in a sense that obviously we are under pressure every single weekend to perform. I think it's important that you don't shy away from that and you acknowledge that there are pressures. Find someone to speak with. If it's a friend, family, a coach. Seek the help that you can get."
#BellLetsTalk . Let's keep the support going 'Caps fans. #VWFC #preseason15 #whitecapsfc — Mau Rosales (@mdr7) January 28, 2015 Former Vancouver Whitecaps centre-back Andy O'Brien spoke about their battle with depression when they played football for Leeds United. O'Brien's move to Major League Soccer helped them overcome some of their lowest points. Playing with Vancouver gave them a new perspective on life and an opportunity to play with the Whitecaps. The Whitecaps participate in hundreds of community events each year. Having a presence in the community helps to put a face on the team, fans, and others not familiar with MLS and the Whitecaps. Ousted knows how important it to make a connection within the community. Bell Let's Talk Day is another way to close the gap and open more of a discussion on important issues like mental health. "I think our presence in the community is very important. I think opportunities like these gets us out and helping in any possible way. I think it's a great initiative from Bell to do this. As a club were happy to help." It's vital to ask for help. Too many people sit by thinking that they don't want to burden someone with what they are going through. Ousted has a message for those worried about reaching out for help. "You'd say seek help. I think you'd be surprised at how many people would love to help people in those situations. I think mental illness is better to speak about than to not say anything about it and seek the help that's available." A lot has changed since Carl Robinson was a football player. In those days you would never hear any sort of talk about off the pitch issues. Any sort of information perceived as a weakness would certainly result in ridicule and mocking from opposition spectators and even teammates. Fast forward to today and the spotlight for mental health issues is getting better. Finding a solution is not as easy as buying a Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D) lamp. Robinson has seen the changes with the awareness level and has their own three key steps to helping those who need some help. "I think it's been magnified a lot more and it's important that it is. It is a problem that does exist and it's important you address it. It's not something as simple as dealing with it overnight. It takes a prolonged period. Identifying it is the first thing, dealing with it and helping people through it is the second thing, and supporting them after they think they're through it is the third thing. We as a club are always supportive of our players, which is why we have open communication to try and allow them to feel comfortable whatever they need and whatever they worry, that they come us, the club and also me on a personal level as a manager." Gershon Koffie is one of the longest tenured Vancouver Whitecaps. They have seen a lot of players come and go and they have lived through the ups and downs of the club. The 24 year-old admitted that they have probably unknowingly helped their teammates through a difficult time at some point. Not everyone is willing to talk openly as others. Koffie wants to see more of an online presence with mental health issues. "I think to help each other we have to put it on social media more for players to get awareness about it. When we see that we are having a conversation about it we can bring it in so people can get to know." Bell Let's Talk Day is a great way to start the process, but mental health issues aren't just a one day problem. Breaking the code of silence and opening up needs to occur more as a normal everyday practice. Everyone has something that they are dealing with. Talking is the key to breaking the silence cycle. Carl Robinson has a final message for those who dealing with mental health issues. "I do yeah, I think it's important that it continues to grow. There are problems, everyone has problems and issues. Life in general is hard, the world is a hard enough place to live in without any problems so if there is an issue or a problem with mental issues. These people need to know that we are 100 percent behind them as a club and individuals as well and we are. We want everyone to be well."

Are we going to let capitalism destroy life on Earth?
According to 99 percent of climate scientists – we'll know by the end of the century.
Scientists have agreed for three decades about what is causing atmospheric temperatures to rise – humans are burning Earth's carbon resources to fuel economic activity.
But even before we knew what was causing the temperature to rise – scientists warned about the dire global impacts of a two degree increase in atmospheric temperatures.
Earth's climate has been basically stable for hundreds of thousands of years.
See more news and opinion from Thom Hartmann at Truthout here.
But that changed during the industrial revolution – when Great Britain realized the potential of coal-powered steam engines.
Soon continental Europe and the US followed suit.
And more than 150 years later – coal, oil and natural gas dominate the global politics and economics: wars are fought over oil; communities are destroyed for coal; and increasingly scarce water supplies are poisoned by natural gas extraction.
The Earth has already warmed about one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels – which means we have to change our energy system completely before the Earth warms another degree in order to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change.
Is it possible?
Scientists say “Yes!” – BUT it will require us to take bold and immediate steps towards a completely renewable energy system.
The technology exists – the shortfall is in investment.
According to the IMF – oil companies get $5.3 trillion in subsidies worldwide per year.
And the oil companies pay only a portion – if any – of the environmental costs of ripping fossil fuels from the ground and burning the CO2 into the atmosphere.
In other words, every living human being and government are paying for coal, oil, and gas companies to profit from the destruction our planet.
And that's not a market failure – that's how the market was set up.
Capitalism as we know it isn't the solution – it's the problem.
In a report in “Nature Climate Change” – scientists point out that we can keep temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius – if every country takes bold and immediate action to deploy current clean energy and limit the use of fossil fuels.
The biggest failure in our system is that there is no price on carbon.
Burning fossil fuels and releasing carbon into our atmosphere has very real costs that corporations aren't paying for – costs that are being kicked down the road for future generations.
In the US, we've let the fossil fuel industry become so profitable that it relentlessly funds campaigns and lobbies to keep oil subsidies in place and weaken environmental regulations – all at the expense of our communities and our planet.
Our current oligarchs claim that renewable power isn't efficient or cheap enough to be competitive or to reliably replace fossil fuels – but that's just not true.
Solar, wind, and wave technology are all ready to be deployed at large scales – and Denmark, Germany, the UK and China, among others, are doing it right now.
Our transportation system is ready for renewables – solar roadways in the Netherlands are proving more effective than expected – and over two dozen models of electric cars are now out on the market.
Our households are ready for renewables: LED lightbulbs and high efficiency appliances mean that households use less energy – and affordable rooftop solar means that households can meet a lot their own energy needs.
We can make renewables competitive if we just cut subsidies to oil and coal companies and enforce our clean air and clean water regulations – but that means getting money out of politics so that legislation is written in the interest of communities and the planet – instead of corporations.
Capitalism is great at creating profits and products – but it doesn't care about environmental justice.
Capitalism doesn't care whether we restore our forests and soils so that the planet can begin to reabsorb the carbon we've dumped into the atmosphere.
Capitalism doesn't care whether streams are poisoned or if the air is noxious – it doesn't care if a river burns because of pollution – and it doesn't care if another technology is ‘cleaner' – unless the ‘dirty' option becomes unprofitable.
That's why we need both more regulation of the fossil fuel industry – and public investments into clean energy like solar and wind.
Capitalism is to make money – but a government like our republic is put into place to protect the people from those whose quest for money harms society. We cannot replace democratic government with capitalism – and climate change proves this.
In fact – climate change challenges capitalism at its very root – is an economy really growing when all the costs are dumped on society while a handful of corporations and billionaires take all the profits?
Science says that we can keep global temperatures from rising another half degree – but it can't be left to a private sector that makes its profits from leaving the costs to everybody else.
It's time for a New Green Deal – we need to stop directly and indirectly subsidizing the fossil fuel industry and we need to invest in a large-scale deployment of current clean energy technologies – one that will create permanent, sustainable jobs, and protect the Earth for future generations.

2012 has been a difficult year for Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister. Justice and Development (Ak) Party Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has faced prisoner hunger strikes and many demonstrations by students and the general public. In just the last weeks of December, thousands of people held protests. Many of these protesters are university students who are tired of seeing fellow students, professors, journalists, and novelists put into prison for speaking against Erdoğan and their oppressive policies that hinder freedom of speech in Turkey.Last week, Student protesters converged on Erdoğan's visit to Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ) in Ankara. Police used so much pepper spray against them that the noxious gas drifted toward the Prime Minister. Kocaeli University students marched through the usually sleepy college town of Izmit and demanded liberty for victims of Erdoğan's political imprisonment. They also disrupted a university meeting. Police used extreme force against student protesters in Istanbul.Earlier this year, three students who simply held up a banner asking for free university tuition at a sports rally were given eight-year prison sentences. Erdoğan often labels those who oppose them as terrorists or backers of a coup. Even army generals have been put in prison under this tactic. Hundreds of prisoners went on a hunger strike this fall, putting further pressure on Erdoğan and drawing world attention.Today on Turkey's news station TRT1 , Erdoğan looked worried and even a little frightened during a live interview. They stated that next year would be their last as Turkish Prime Minister."The press is reporting only bad things about me lately," they said. "They don't mention all the good I've done such as strengthening the economy of Turkey."Indeed, Turkey's economy has seen growth under the Ak Party and Erdoğan. Yet, they have used tactics such as giving away refrigerators to poor families and iPads to students in a ploy that opposition leaders condemn as buying votes.Erdoğan's successor will likely be another Ak Party man because the Ak Party got most voter support in the latest (2011) elections. The Ak Party has been pushing pro-Islam legislation, such as requiring public schools to teach Islam more frequently to students and allowing mosques to be built on public university grounds—with tax-payers money. These principles go against the secular democratic views of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk , founder of the modern Turkish Republic which began on Republic Day , October 29, 1923.Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu of the Republican People's Party (CHP), the main opposing party (and Atatürk's party), has been extremely critical of Erdoğan this year. On Republic Day, October 29 2012, thousands of people turned out to celebrate Atatürk's ideals of freedom of speech, religion, the press, and assembly despite the fact that Erdoğan declared all public celebrations of Freedom Day to be illegal. Police used water cannons and pepper spray against the crowd which was led by Kılıçdaroğlu who even suffered some irritation to their own eyes. Local news stations such as Haber Turk covered this event, and Erdoğan told their police force to back down--but not before Associated Press and other premier news sources brought these events to international attention.Recently, clandestine listening devices (bugs) were found in Erdoğan's home office . CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu called this wiretapping, " a grave situation ."The tide seems to be turning in Turkey. Perhaps this will effect the United States of America. Supporters of Erdoğan have called them " best friends with President Obama ." Opponents have labeled Erdoğan as Obama's puppet. In any case, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is worried."I've never seen Erdoğan look so subdued on public television," one young Turkish man stated (his identity is protected for security reasons). "Usually they are yelling, but now you can tell that they are scared. Just look at their eyes. I don't know who will be the new Prime Minister of Turkey, but they will probably be from the Ak Party. Thirty years ago in Turkey, when so many students began protesting, there was a sudden change in Prime Ministers and ruling parties. Erdoğan sees that their time is ending."
Vermont lawmakers just approved a 46% tax hike on all vapor/electronic cigarette products, including e-liquid.
The Vermont state house approved the measure, narrowly in a 70-67 vote. One of the bills the biggest proponents Jim McCullough, D-Williston said “If we permit this to continue without regulation, then we are aiding and abetting nicotine addiction, guaranteed for our children in middle school right now”.
Unfortunately Mr. McCullough seems to think a tax hike will somehow deter children from purchasing Vapor products. Apparently middle school students are very informed about tax policy in the lovely state of Vermont.
But we won`t pick on Mr. McCullough too much, since he's only one of countless politicians beginning to sound like a broken record. The same argument repeated over and over again, with their unfounded claims, exaggerated interpretations of data and just good old fashioned out right lies.
The irony is, mouth breathing politicians like McCullough defeat their own arguments while also revealing their ulterior motives.
Case in point: how exactly does a tax hike deter middle school students from purchasing vapor products?
Minors cannot purchase e-cigs. They usually acquire them through third parties i.e.: older person getting them one. A tax hike only harms and hinders small business owners, reducing vape shops profit and causing them to close.
Seems like they want small businesses and vape shops to close. State governments are worried about the loss of tax revenue from tobacco sales.

The issue here isn't just the tax, although it's unfair, at the end of the day taxation will be unavailable for our industry. As the saying goes, there are only two guarantees in life death and taxes. The issue is the propaganda and misinformation used by politicians to justify regulations. Masking their greed with false concern for children instead of being transparent.
Dean Robinson is suing Essendon for damages over the supplements saga
ESSENDON'S former high performance manager Dean Robinson will press on with their million-dollar breach of contract case against the club.
Robinson, a key figure in the Essendon supplements scandal, says the club breached its terms of employment with them when they were suspended from their role in February 2013, days after revelations players may have been taking illegal performance-enhancing supplements.
They resigned in July and claims the club didn't offer them procedural fairness from the time it stood them down until their departure.
Their lawyer, David Galbally, said on Tuesday their client had breached court-ordered deadlines in the case because of significant financial and emotional pressure, but was now ready to proceed.
They said the club stood Robinson down with pay, on agreement that they not speak about the supplements issue, before denigrating them and forcing them to resign.
"He has suffered significant depression, they have four children under four, their wife has depression and post-natal depression and has been in and out of hospital," Galbally told the Melbourne Magistrates Court.
Robinson had co-operated with the Australian Sport Anti-Doping Agency investigation into the supplements issue and incurred legal costs.
Paul O'Grady, representing Essendon, said the case had gone nowhere in six months and Robinson had missed many appointments to view its documents in the case.
Galbally said it was in Robinson's best interests to move forward.
Supreme Court Associate Justice Melissa Daly agreed, but warned Robinson would face penalties for any further delays and awarded costs for the hearing against him.
 They are seeking $1.2 million in lost income, as well as damages and court costs.
Both ASADA and the AFL have investigated Essendon over the supplements scandal.
On Friday, ASADA issued show-cause notices to 34 past and present Essendon players.
Among other penalties, the AFL banned Essendon from last season's finals and suspended coach James Hird for 12 months.
Robinson's case is set for a further direction hearing on September 9.

THE GUERRILLA ANGEL REPORT — Charles Barkley, the former NBA star, sports commentator and now, Weight Watchers spokesperson, posed in drag for the upcoming Weight Watchers campaign to get men on board with losing weight.
Now, this may or may not cause a ruckus with some, but Barkley, who has been known to perform in drag in the past, might be doing us a favor by helping reduce some of the negative stigma some people in society have against those who do not conform to their rigid set of beliefs. Barkley, after all, is the kind a guy many of those same people would gladly have a beer with.
It'll be interesting to see how this new Weight Watchers campaign plays out — does it open a few minds while getting the attention of those in need of a weight loss program or does it backfire and causes heads to roll at the advertising firm that thought up this promotion?

They already are, of course, but now they want to spend your dollars to propagandize you! Action Alert!
Hidden within a large federal spending bill is a proposal for $3 million to go toward consumer education and outreach to “promote understanding and acceptance of agricultural biotechnology”—a campaign to be carried out jointly by the FDA and the USDA.
In plain English, this proposal would spend taxpayer dollars on an effort to convince Americans that GMOs are just fine—perhaps even that they shouldn't be labeled.
This is far from the first time that the feds have spent taxpayer money to browbeat those same taxpayers with government propaganda. Last year, we reported on federal efforts to enhance “vaccine confidence”—essentially, an attempt to steamroll citizens who have legitimate concerns. Now it's the same on the GMO front.
Sneaky maneuvers like this are only necessary because an overwhelming majority of Americans want to see their food labeled for GMO ingredients. Consumers have spoken loud and clear on this issue, and luckily Congress listened: industry-backed voluntary labeling legislation failed to pass the Senate, and a compromise is not likely to be reached by the time Vermont's mandatory labeling law goes into effect in July.
Strong grassroots support for mandatory GMO labeling was defeated in California, Washington, and Oregon—but only after massive campaign spending promoting all sorts of misinformation by the Grocery Manufacturers Association and its allies.
Clearly, it is some members of Congress, not consumers, who must be “educated” on the lack of information confirming the safety of GMOs and the millions of tons of toxic herbicides that are being dumped on our food as a result of this technology.
Action Alert! Write to Congress and urge your representatives to oppose the inclusion of a rider that would spend taxpayer dollars on “education” programs to convince Americans to “accept” GMOs. Please send your message immediately.

It's time to wrap up March 2017 in this month's Monthly Lojban Community Roundup, where I attempt to find the month's most interesting material from IRC, the mailing list, Reddit, Facebook and Twitter, and present it here in a condensed form.
Previous issues:
Unlike last month, where picking out interesting topics to cover was at least somewhat akin to finding needles in a haystack, there really wasn't much hay in March at all. It was a calm month, though there were at least a few things worth appreciating.
CLL update
Robin Powell reported that the ebook and print versions of the CLL “are finally linked” (there used to be a problem with getting Amazon to link the ebook to the new print edition instead of the old one). Also, the “Look Inside” feature is finally working, which means people can read part of the book directly on Amazon before buying it.
In a way, this marks the end of a long and painful process of getting a new CLL both in print and in ebook format out and to set up a toolchain that would allow us to generate new editions more easily (the first edition of the CLL was created in Word, and the huge index in the back was put together by hand). The bulk of the work on CLL1.1 was done by Robin Powell themselves (who considered this project the last thing they owed the Lojban community).
Thank you, Robin.

Returns and Re-returns
A handful of people announced their return to the logjamming party this month. One of them (fi'i la .temlat.) even drew a comic for the occasion:
Can you understand what the cat is saying?
The following is another example:
Really, this seems to be a common theme around the lojbosphere. People leave, but most people come back at some point. Unfortunately, said comebacks are often followed by another subsequent disappearance. I've seen some people slilu in and out of jbopre-hood with dazzling frequencies, and some of them would have to start from scratch everytime. On the other hand, those who stick around for a while tend to make a lot more progress in their studies, duh. Therefore, stay, be patient, and keep at it. Just accept the fact that Lojban will not let you go.

Experimental Grammars
A bunch of people asked about where to find the different experimental grammars.
If you go to http://lojban.github.io/ilmentufa/camxes.html and open the Parser dropdown menu you can choose from among a few different experimental grammars, most notably a CBM (cmevla-brivla-merge) grammar, and CKT (ce-ki-tau) grammar and zantufa. There are of course plenty of other grammars, but these are a good start, with so many people now favoring a cmevla-brivla-merge and CKT being at least partially popular. And zantufa is worth checking out no matter what, make sure to read the wiki page!
NOIhA
Since we're already on the topic of grammar(s), I have made another step in my journey to deciding on NOIhA's grammar (see my article on NOIhA for context — it's very useful stuff). In that article I sketched out three possible grammars. Option 2 used to be my favored candidate, but now that I've had the chance to use and analyze NOIhA-ful Lojban (as opposed to the old NOIhA-less variety) for a while I can more adequately judge the advantages and disadvantages from a practical standpoint, and I have also made a few realizations why Option 3 might actually be the way to go after all.
First of all, if we think back, the main downside of Option 2 was the need for be to link additional arguments to the adverb. The question was whether this be been too much of a burden. In plain numbers, it now seems as though most uses of poi'a and noi'a are followed by a sumti. An option that saves that be would be Option 3 (then you get to say poi'a cabna lo crisa “concurrently with summer” without any be).
Option 3 has the grammar of FIhO. Really, with Option 3, NOIhA is simply a better fi'o, with clear semantics and precision.
The reason I originally didn't love Option 3 was that I was put off by the ku in expressions like soi'a cafne ku mi tatpi “Often, I am tired”, but this is how other prepositions work in Lojban, even adverbials that cannot tag anything require ku when they aren't selbri tcita (NA and (arguably) CAhA). With that in mind, it shouldn't be weird if NOIhA were the same.
Option 3 comes with more advantages that are simply a consequence of the FIhO grammar: Being able to combine NOIhA with gi or jai, for instance.
Consider this example:
lo jai poi'a temdu'e fe'u denpa
“That which is no longer possible due to having waited too long”
This should really show the expressive potential of poi'a and its flexibility when it has FIhO's grammar.
Option 3 is also the only of the three that allows for the rather necessary possibility of attaching adverbs directly to the selbri (and thus, the bridi-tail).
Bottomline, I feel like Option 3 just sits better with the rest of Lojban's adverbial-prepositional machinery.
Also, remember this tweet?
The day, nay, the hour the community has settled on short NOIhA, I will start working seriously on my second #lojban album. https://t.co/d6B6HlL2IR — Djemynai (@Djemynai) October 14, 2016
I now favor the idea of using pu'a for poi'a and nu'a for noi'a. I doubt we'll be able to get anything shorter that still uses p- and n- and doesn't needlessly destroy some other part of the language. pu'a and nu'a AGE pretty enough and they won't be badly missed in their old faculty (nu'a is a relatively uninteresting mekso cmavo that I'm sure a replacement can be found for; xorxes has long ago proposed that me could even do nu'a‘s job). I say try out pu'a and nu'a for a bit and let me know what it's like!

Human-caused climate change helped fuel the current California drought, says a Stanford University study released Monday.
Climate change has increased the chance that the two main weather conditions that led to the drought — higher than average temperatures and little rain or snow — will occur at the same time, the study shows.
Almost 98% of California is now enduring a drought, which is entering its fourth year and shows no signs of relenting, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
The study, led by Stanford scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, found that the worst droughts in California's history occurred when conditions were both dry and warm, and that global warming is increasing the probability those two weather patterns will coincide.
Diffenbaugh said having very dry years that are also very warm would not have happened without human influence.
Burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal increases the amount of carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" gases in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes.
The study also projected that the trend will continue of dry and warm years happening together.
Diffenbaugh and their team looked at historical weather records and computer model simulations to reach their conclusions.
Other scientists not involved in the Stanford study questioned some of its methodology and findings.
Scientist Martin Hoerling with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the current lack of rain or snow in California is clearly not part of a long-term trend, or part of human-induced climate change, as many studies have already shown.
They also said a drought measurement tool used by the Stanford team — the Palmer Drought Severity Index — is "flawed and unreliable" to assess the impact of climate change.
"The warming trend can only account for a small fraction of the actual warmth in California the past two winters," Columbia University scientist Richard Seager said.
They said most of the warm temperatures were caused by the same ridge of high pressure in the atmosphere that also minimized any rain or snow.
Hoerling and Seager were co-authors of a NOAA report in December that said natural weather patterns, not human-made global warming, were the primary cause of the drought.
The Stanford study appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“Musicians don't work very much,” Zach Frankel says with a smile. Their brother Alex, of the DFA duo Holy Ghost!, laughs. The brothers have just opened Frankel's Delicatessen & Appetizing in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, so Zach has thought about this a bit—"this" meaning, why it seems like more and more musicians are embracing their inner-gourmand as of late. “They have plenty of time to eat food and talk about food,” they say, “and meet up with their friends to talk about and eat food.”
Zach's idea about the musician lifestyle does hold some water, but there's got to be more to it than that. On one hand, bands tour, so their members have more opportunities than most to see the world and try different foods along the way. On the other hand, they ride in vans and busses down long stretches of highway where their culinary options involve a drive-thru, maybe Waffle House if they're lucky. Then there's the day job thing. There's a decent chance someone from your favorite band, before they “made it” (whatever that even means these days), found themselves bussing tables, taking orders, cooking on the line, or bartending.
Alex would like to edit their younger brother's theory: It's not that musicians don't work very much, it's that they don't usually have to wake up early because of when they work. “We can meet up and have late dinners.”
There's a different energy in a restaurant past a certain time, when all the first dates and business meetings are winding down, when the drinks seem to pour easier and the people there actually seem to like each other. Of course, these boozy late-night dinners lead to rough mornings (or early afternoons, to be more accurate), and that's where one of the most intriguing items on the Frankels' menu comes in. The basic New York City egg and cheese sandwich, a staple of any hangover recovery program, is paired with another local favorite, pastrami. This is a sandwich that basically dares you to go out and get drunk just to have an excuse to eat one the next morning.
On a recent day at Frankel's, we spotted Neon Indian's Alan Palomo and the greatest mean-mugged dog ever, Sammie.
Late nights and long tours aside, the Frankel brothers' new deli is far more than an excuse to flex their knowledge, like Alex's label boss James Murphy did last year when they opened the Four Horsemen wine bar in Williamsburg. This runs a little deeper than that—it's something from their past.
“The brisket we grew up on is nothing like what you see in restaurants,” Alex says of their sweet, salty, and sour brisket, a combination of their grandmother's recipe mixed with chef Ashley Berman's grandmothers' very different takes on the Jewish staple. This is the kind of comfort food the brothers grew up eating, just like their parents, and their parents' parents. The Frankels aren't rewriting the rules or doing anything totally out there; they're paying tribute. But serving some of the most iconic foods in one of the most famous food cities in the world isn't necessarily an easy task.
While the Frankels' brisket was already well-known in some circles (“Our friend A-Trak has a Hanukkah party, and four years ago we started bringing the brisket because people freaked out,” Alex says), when it was announced that the brothers were opening a Jewish-style deli, it seemed obvious that they were wearing their influences on their sleeves, namely Manhattan food landmarks Barney Greengrass and Russ & Daughters. Sure, musicians often say an album or specific era influenced them when recording, but New York City food is a different story. You can be an iconoclast, like Mile End's Noah Bernamoff, who went from playing bass in the band the Lovely Feathers to pairing Montreal-style smoked meats with bagels—something still considered sacrilege in certain food circles. Or you can do what the Frankels are doing, side more with tradition. Both paths are treacherous in their own ways in the fast-moving New York food scene. Like music, tastes are always changing and critics can ruin you.
Here's my general rule of thumb for any place that prominently boasts bagels and smoked fish as a centerpiece of the menu: If the whitefish sucks, walk out. That, I believe, is the best measuring stick, and the stuff they serve at Frankel's, I swear, might be some of the best I've ever had. Making good whitefish salad is incredibly difficult and fraught with pitfalls ranging in severity from being too chunky or creamy, all the way to tasting like cold fish paste (literally like you mashed up whitefish with Elmer's). The brothers' whitefish is meaty and hearty, but also doesn't weigh you down after you've had it, so there's room for more. Which is good, because there's definitely more worth eating at Frankel's.
Since the most important thing is taken care of, there's the other aspect of their story, and that's the music. With the help of friends like El-P and Despot as investors, the brothers have made their deli as close to a DIY effort as you can ask for in a new Brooklyn restaurant. They aren't part of a corporate restaurant empire, and while Zach and Chef Berman both come from food backgrounds (Berman was a longtime food stylist who worked with Zach at Brooklyn's Meat Hook), there's no celebrity chef attached to the project. Yet their friends were still willing to get involved. “The first people we asked to be partners just said, 'Yeah, sure,' just like that,” Alex says. “People really trusted us because when two brothers say they're going to do something, people know they're going to do it.” They also mention Andrew Raposo, who was in Midnight Magic and Hercules and Love Affair, as the first person they approached as a partner. “After him, everyone came in,” Alex says.
Of course, there are still little things they're figuring out, like managing the lunch rush, smoking enough meat so they won't run out by dinner, and most importantly, queuing up the deli's daily soundtrack. Alex is in charge of that, and when I ask what they tend to hear, Zach mentions the classical stuff their brother was playing during the morning rush. “Steve Reich's Music for 18 Musicians,” Alex replies. I can see how Reich's love of repetition might keep things humming along and give a nice flow to a long line of hungry customers looking for kippered salmon or latkes topped with caviar.
*The brothers behind the counter during lunch rush, a few days after opening. *
Ultimately, what this all boils down to is feeling. No matter how good your brisket or lox are, if it doesn't have neshama (the Hebrew word for “spirit”), then it won't work out. Frankel's looks great—with bright white subway tiles, a big red neon sign, classic hand-painted lettering, and bottles of U-bet syrup on the shelves next to boxes of matzo—but more importantly, the brothers' love for what they're making is evident. Incidental but telling proof that this is more than just a side business or a hobby for Alex when they aren't making music (which he'll continue to do with Holy Ghost!, with a new EP out later this month) arrives as they point to their hat, embroidered with the Frankel name, and says, “I would never wear my band merch.”
BEREA, Ohio -- Ben Tate on Sunday will face their former team, the Houston Texans, with no idea how many carries he'll get.
That's not an ideal reality for Tate, who said "I'd be lying" if the Cleveland Browns' three-back rotation that came to life Thursday at Cincinnati was satisfying for them personally.
Running back Ben Tate has carried the ball 20 times for 37 yards and a touchdown in the past two games, both victories for the AFC North-leading Browns. Andrew Weber/USA TODAY Sports
Tate, Isaiah Crowell and Terrance West each scored a touchdown against the Bengals, with West leading the crew with 26 carries compared to 12 for Crowell and 10 for Tate.
Tate acknowledged he'd prefer being a 20-carry-a-game player, which they expected to be when signing a two-year deal in the offseason worth a reported $7 million.
"It's not [satisfying]," said Tate, who has 342 yards and four scores on 104 carries this season for the AFC North-leading Browns (6-3). "But whatever the organization thinks is best for the team, that's what they are going to do."
Tate was explosive in Weeks 5 and 6, combining for 202 yards and two touchdowns against Pittsburgh and Tennessee. Since then, he's registered 99 yards on 51 carries. The Browns have involved them in the passing game the past two weeks with six receptions for 56 yards. Crowell, an undrafted rookie, leads the team with five touchdowns despite only 64 carries, the lowest workload of the three. West, a third-round pick in May, has re-emerged after falling out of the rotation in October.
Tate said the Browns indicated he'd be the workhorse for the offense, which he's been for much of the season but not in back-to-back 10-carry games. They said the running game's emergence Thursday -- 170 yards on 52 attempts -- was a byproduct of better play across the board, from the backs to the offensive line.
"The player I was against Tennessee, I don't think I've changed," said Tate, referring to their two-touchdown performance against the Titans. "I don't think I've gotten a step slower all of a sudden. I think it's just a combination of everything."
The emergence of West and Crowell has contributed to the sporadic rotation. Tate said both other players have gotten better throughout the season. Tate isn't going full-blast mode on the Browns, acknowledging, "You look like the bad guy." Tate and Crowell both said this week that they find out the Browns' tailback distribution plans during the game when they are called onto the field. The production is not outlined beforehand. That's not always easy.
"We're winning. We're 6-3, in first place," said Tate, who rushed for 1,992 yards and 10 touchdowns over three seasons as Arian Foster's backup in Houston. "That's all that really matters."
Getting a read on the Browns' weekly tailback plans is an arduous task, but they won't give up on Tate, who understands Cleveland's zone-blocking scheme and brings a veteran presence. It seems the Browns are looking for big plays, carries of 20-plus yards, to ease the tension on the passing game. That's in part why Crowell and West keep getting chances.
Coach Mike Pettine said all three backs have been productive and are "team guys."
"When their number's called, they have to step up and respond," Pettine said. "I'm not going to get too wrapped up in the psychology behind it. They are professionals."
