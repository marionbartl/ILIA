Having failed miserably to produce even one single shred of tangible evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to stage a coup in 2016's presidential election, Democrats, rather than simply admit that their entire crusade to prove a false narrative was nothing more than a charade designed to cover up their embarrassing defeat, have decided to shift the narrative to target "pro-Trump websites." You know, because a couple of websites sharing stories over Facebook clearly overshadowed the 24/7 Hillary Clinton cheerleading sessions on CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, Washington Post, New York Times...
Per The Guardian, this convenient shift in the 'Russian hacking' narrative comes just as Trump's former head of digital media has been summoned to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to answer for their alleged 'sins."
The spread of Russian-made fake news stories aimed at discrediting Hillary Clinton on social media is emerging as an important line of inquiry in multiple investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Investigators are looking into whether Trump supporters and far-right websites coordinated with Moscow over the release of fake news, including stories implicating Clinton in murder or pedophilia, or paid to boost those stories on Facebook. The head of the Trump digital camp, Brad Parscale, has reportedly been summoned to appear before the House intelligence committee looking into Moscow's interference in the 2016 US election. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee carrying out a parallel inquiry, has said that at least 1,000 “paid internet trolls working out of a facility in Russia” were pumping anti-Clinton fake news into social media sites during the campaign.
Ironically, the same investigators digging into the "Trump collusion" narrative admit that similar media campaigns were used during the Democratic primaries in favor of Bernie Sanders. Oddly, however, there has been no organized effort to figure out whether or not Bernie conspired with Putin to destroy Clinton's chances at the White House.
A huge wave of fake news stories originating from eastern Europe began washing over the presidential election months earlier, at the height of the primary campaign. John Mattes, who was helping run the outline campaign for the Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders from San Diego, said it really took off in March 2016. “In a 30-day period, dozens of full-blown sites appeared overnight, running full level productions posts. It screamed out to me that something strange was going on,” Mattes said. Much of the material was untraceable, but they tracked 40% of the new postings back to eastern Europe. Four of the Facebook members posting virulent and false stories about Clinton (suggesting, for example, that they had profited personally by arming Islamic State extremists) had the same name, Oliver Mitov. They all had a very small number of Facebook friends, including one which all four had in common. When Mattes tried to friend them and contact them there was no reply. Many websites producing anti-Clinton fake news were based in Albania and Macedonia. A pro-Sanders Facebook page with nearly 90,000 followers was run by an Albanian IT expert who, when interviewed by the Huffington Post, appeared to speak very little English, although their page consistently published polished English prose.
Of course, it's also extremely unclear how these master media experts, running websites that appeared out of thin air and have since all vanished, manged to only convince voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania to turn out Clinton while failing to sway folks in Colorado, Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday brushed aside accusations in a recent discredited report that President-elect Donald Trump had once cavorted with prostitutes in Moscow. While doing so, however, they managed to plug the local sex trade.
Trump is “a grown man,” Putin said, according to Bloomberg News, “and secondly he's someone who has been involved with beauty contests for many years and has met the most beautiful women in the world … I find it hard to believe that they rushed to some hotel to meet girls of loose morals, although ours are undoubtedly the best in the world.”

The allegations were contained in a “dossier” that had circulated for months in Beltway media without ever being substantiated, and which was published by Buzzfeed last week, along with the disclaimer: “It is not just unconfirmed: It includes some clear errors.”
Among the more salacious accusations was that Trump had hired several prostitutes to urinate on a bed in a Moscow hotel room where President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama had once spent the night. Trump angrily denied the claims in a press conference last week, and most media organizations cast doubt on their credibility. Russia also denied the accusations, including the suggestion that the Russian government had been colluding with the Trump campaign itself.
Putin added that the allegations were “obvious fabrications,” Bloomberg reported. They added: “People who order fakes of the type now circulating against the U.S. president-elect, who concoct them and use them in a political battle, are worse than prostitutes because they don't have any moral boundaries at all.”

The case went all the way to the Supreme Court.
And in a 5-to-4 decision, the liberal justices, joined by moderate Anthony Kennedy, sided with the government officials, ruling that they could force Americans out of their homes and transfer ownership of the land to a private corporation.
The 2005 decision sparked a popular backlash. As the conservative Justice Sandra Day O'Connor observed in their dissenting opinion, “the specter of condemnation hangs over all property. Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.” Another conservative justice, Clarence Thomas, observed that “though citizens are safe from the government in their homes, the homes themselves are not.”
That same year, the court's decision was praised by a billionaire real-estate developer with a personal interest in eminent domain. (He once tried to have the government force a woman from their home against their will so they could build a limousine parking lot.) They told Fox News of the ruling, “I happen to agree with it 100 percent.”
Their name: Donald Trump, the same man a faction of conservatives is trying to elect because they insist, against all evidence, that their judicial nominations are to be trusted.
This is folly.
“Donald Trump's view of eminent domain is not just immoral and un-American,” John Nolte wrote at Breitbart.com, one of the most pro-Trump publications in America, “it exposes a very troubling mindset that contradicts the populist appeal that has helped them get as far as they have in the Republican primary. People need to ask themselves if they want a second president in a row who's so eager to use the fascist power of government to crush the individual in furtherance of corporate interests.”
And eminent domain is just one of many reasons to reject the proposition that it makes sense to vote Trump because their Supreme Court nominations will protect the Constitution, or the conservative or libertarian agenda, or that they will thwart the left. A posture that amounts to “trust him, he'll come through” is an absurd folly put forward by pundits who would not lend Trump money if they ran a bank. They see, in that case, that they would fleece their creditors as soon as they had an incentive to do so. Yet they fail to see that were Trump elected, they would have no incentive to advance an originalist legal philosophy and every incentive to do the opposite.
Their failure of imagination is best fleshed out by Ilya Somin, the libertarian legal scholar, who opined at the Washington Post about what Trump judges are likely to look like:
If Trump wins and their agenda is seen as a political success, they will have the opportunity to move the GOP further in a National Front-like direction. And a Trumpist/National Front party will have little use for limited government-originalist judicial philosophy. To the contrary, federalism, the separation of powers, and many individual rights limitations on government power would be an impediment to its agenda. A Trumpist GOP would, over time, seek to appoint judges in line with its priorities. We don't yet know what the full contours of a Trumpist judicial philosophy might be. But they are likely to include sweeping executive power (so the party's Great Leader will not be hamstrung by constraints on their power), a narrow view of freedom of speech (so they can intimidate critics with libel suits and administrative harassment), tight restrictions on civil liberties (making it easier to, among other things, round up and deport many millions of undocumented immigrants), and weakening constitutional property rights (so that the government can have a free in transferring property to its cronies in the business community).
This really isn't difficult: Multiple policies that Trump has proposed violate the Constitution. Yet their apologists ask us to assume that this unprincipled admirer of authoritarian strongman Putin will nominate judges who will reliably rein in the government!
Meet John Lennon for real! These 80 candid snapshots of John Lennon on the streets were taken by their fans from the late 1960s to the year 1980.John Lennon was the most iconic Beatle. They were group's most committed rock & roller, its social conscience, and its slyest verbal wit. With the Beatles, they wrote or co-wrote dozens of classics – from "She Loves You" to "Come Together" – and delivered many of them with a cutting, humane, and distinct voice that would make them one of the greatest singers rock has ever produced.Lennon's brutally confessional solo work and their political activism were a huge influence on subsequent generations of singers, songwriters and social reformers. After the Beatles' breakup, they and wife Yoko Ono recorded together and separately, striving to break taboos and to be ruthlessly, publicly honest in their music and public performances. When Lennon was murdered on December 8, 1980, they seemed on the verge of a new, more optimistic phase. In the years since, their image has become a staple of T-shirts and posters, used by rock fans and activists alike as a symbol of peace.(Photos via Meet the Beatles for Real
NYC hotel owner refuses to boot locals

UPDATE, 5:30 p.m.: The 2012 New York Marathon has been canceled.
ORIGINAL POST: The owner of a Hilton Garden Inn hotel in Staten Island refuses to kick out their current guests, who lost their homes to superstorm Sandy, to runners arriving for Sunday's New York City Marathon.

Hotel owner Richard Nicotra told Hotel Check-In Friday afternoon that local residents are relying on their hotel while they remain homeless due to the storm and that they won't let them down.
Both Nicotra and their wife are second-generation Staten Island residents. Local cable channel NY1 first reported the story on Thursday.

"We opened up the doors to our hotels on Saturday and Sunday for people, and everybody anticipated being here for Monday night when the storm happened," Nicotra says. "They were hoping to go back to their houses. Tuesday was supposed to be a little better and Wednesday was supposed to be fine, but by Wednesday, we started to realize it was worse than we thought."
At first the hotel was telling guests that they would have to leave by Thursday, because they were sold out with marathon runners. But on Thursday morning, Nicotra's guests were in tears at the thought of checking out, they say.
"On Thursday morning, people were begging me and crying saying 'You can't throw me out. I have no place to go,'" they say.
Nicotra said they then contacted the marathon's organizers, the New York Road Runners, because they had a contract for rooms and told them "we have a problem here" and that "we can't just throw them out." Nicotra said they gave the group other options, including setting up a temporary dormitory in the hotel's 10,000-square-foot ballroom, which can house up to 500 people with cots.
"As Hilton says, hospitality is what we're all about. If we can make everyone happy we will, but if we can't, the choice is easy," Nicotra says. "We need to take care of our neighbors."
As a result of the NY1 story on Thursday, the hotel has seen a strong response on social media - almost all supportive, says Kristine Garlisi, spokesperson for the Hilton Garden Inn in Staten Island's Bloomfield neighborhood.
"Hundreds of people" wrote in on the hotel's Facebook page to show their support, they say.
The reaction illustrates the challenge that New York faces in housing both local victims of Sandy and out-of-town visitors who can help bolster the economy. In announcing their decision to go ahead with the marathon two days ago, Mayor Michael Bloomberg cited the event's economic impact.
The city-wide event traditionally attracts about 50,000 runners, including many from out of town who travel with friends or relatives, stay in hotels and spend money on restaurants.
TWITTER: Follow USA TODAY's Barb DeLollis
But the challenge is housing all of the runners who will show up.
Many hotels are filled with locals whose homes aren't habitable and out-of-town visitors who have not been able to fly back home because of the backlog caused by multi-day airport closures - two groups that keep extending their stays.
Meanwhile, marathon runners and their supporters had booked hotels months ago specifically so they could participate in the high-profile, annual event.
Among the hotels that do have room: The Pod Hotel on East 39th Street, which is selling rooms without electricity for around $160 a night.
Some runners conflicted
Baltimore-based marathon runner Ryan McGrath, 31, cohost of a radio show about running, told Hotel Check-In that they still plan to run Sunday's marathon, which will be their second in New York.
"When the mayor announced on Wednesday that (the marathon) was still going to be held, there was a very small percentage of people who were supportive," they say. "The biggest concern is the ethical dilemma of displacing people who are without homes who are staying in hotels."
But McGrath has been affected by Sandy, too. Before the storm, he'd planned to stay with their parents who live near the battered beach town of Sea Bright, N.J., but their home lost power. So now he's trying to find lodging. Some of their friends had reserved hotel rooms months ago - yet now are unsure whether the hotels are open or will have availability to check them in.
"Everything has been wiped out in our town," McGrath says. "It's not like I'm sitting here from a 30,000 foot view saying nothing's affected me. It's important for the city not only to move on and put on that tough New York attitude, but also from a financial perspective. I think a lot of of the people who are very angry aren't runners."

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called "the most dangerous place in the world." A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children.
One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.
Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many "sensitive operations" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in.
The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. They were born and raised in the tribal areas. They took care of us while we were there, and they were a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.
See more stories on VBS.TV
Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand.
The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s.
These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army.
This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.
But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.
For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.

The month of cauliflower was weird. Like, ‘What do we do with all this cauliflower?' weird. They made soup.
Then, there were the radishes. So. Many. Radishes. They turned them into soup.
Chef Suzy DeYoung and their “Bucket Brigade” of local chefs are on a mission: Use donated produce to make soup. Use soup to save the city.
Sort of.
“We've got to start somewhere,” said DeYoung, 57. “So if we start with food – the basic necessity of food – the schools have a better chance of doing their job.”
It's called La Soupe (that's “süp,” not “sü-PAY”) and here is how it works: Stores such as Kroger and Jungle Jim's donate produce they would otherwise throw away, and DeYoung and a team of volunteer chefs turn it into soup. Then, they give that soup – or, sometimes, stew or gumbo or casserole – to people who are hungry.
Buy Photo Jimmy Gibson, executive chef and co-owner of Jimmy G's in downtown Cincinnati, volunteers to create soup for La Soupe twice monthly. They never knows what produce he'll receive, like when they got a large quantity of radishes. They turned it into ginger, turnip and beef soup that people raved about. (Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour)
It's shameful, DeYoung said, how much food gets thrown away while so many go hungry. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, somewhere between 30 percent and 40 percent of the food supply in the U.S. is wasted – more than 20 pounds per person per month.
Globally, one of every four calories never gets eaten.
Buy Photo Andrew Porter, with the Jungle Jim's Eastgate produce department, loads produce that's being donated to La Soupe. The produce would otherwise go to the landfill. Suzy DeYoung and their team go through the boxes and use what they can, which is most of it. Anything left is donated to pig farmers. (Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour)
DeYoung does what they can. La Soupe collects about 4,000 pounds of produce a month. There are more than 60 volunteers who haul soup and produce to and fro, from stores to chefs to hungry mouths.
Soup is delivered to five schools every Friday and to another six or seven schools and churches during the week. DeYoung also hosts cooking classes at Oyler School, DePaul Cristo Rey High School and John P. Parker School. Soon, she's launching another class at Child Focus in Mount Washington.
La Soupe started about three years ago, and it's a model that's learning as it grows. Where are the best schools to host classes? What recipes are good to share, easy for young students to recreate with what they have at home? What is the best way to bring onboard more chefs, get more donations, attract more volunteers?
Education is priority No. 1, DeYoung said; it's the best shot at a better life for Cincinnati's children. “But if you can't learn because you're not eating, the answer has to be in the food.”
'The last stop'
DeYoung uses words like “rescued” and “saved” when they talk about produce. Fire- and police stations are safe houses for babies, they said; La Soupe is the safe house for fruits and vegetables.
"We're the last stop," they said. "If it hits us and it's usable, we use it."
If it's not usable, DeYoung passes it on to pig farmers down the road. They don't want to preach, but they do want change – they want people to see food how they see it.
"I never looked at it as disposable," they say.

Though they have staples, like potato chowder, the menu changes each week, depending on the produce received. DeYoung refers to their location as their "Soupe Shack." (Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour)
DeYoung grew up in Mount Lookout. Them father, Pierre Adrian, was head chef at the Maisonette in Cincinnati, and their grandparents were chefs in New York. DeYoung and their sister co-ran La Petite Pierre in Madeira until DeYoung split off to focus on La Soupe.
They were born to be a chef. And she's still a chef, but now, she's a teacher, transportation manager and beggar, too. They hate asking for money – "It's so uncomfortable," they said – but they hate even more the thought of doing nothing. And to change how a generation eats? That's expensive.
Cincinnati is speckled with food deserts on the United States Department of Agriculture's map. USDA defines a food desert as an area where residents are low-income and have little access to healthy food. There are dozens of deserts in the I-275 loop.
For its population, Cincinnati needs 10 more grocery stores to catch up with the national average, said Renee Mahaffey Harris, chief operating officer of the Avondale-based Center for Closing the Health Gap. Without a nearby grocer – and without a car to get to one farther away – people turn to convenience stores, where options are limited and less-healthy.
Good food is but one in a long list of necessities, Harris said, but it truly is life and death. In 2010, Cincinnati had 1,400 diet-related deaths, they said – deaths from diseases attributable, at least in part, to food. That includes diabetes, stroke and heart disease.
"That does tell you, we have a lot of work to do," Harris said, "because what you eat does affect your overall health."

A ‘sigh of relief' for parents
“Hello, everyone! I'm Suzy.”
DeYoung is standing in the cafeteria at John P. Parker elementary in Madisonville. It's evening. Class let out hours ago, but the building is still bustling. Students race around the gym playing basketball. In the cafeteria, parents huddle around tables with their young children, taste-testing soup and listening to DeYoung.
They share the “secret” to seasoning food. They teach the children how to chop and peel vegetables, then they let them practice on piles of produce.
On one corner of the stage, there's a stack of new slow-cooker Crock-Pots that will be given away. That practice started after DeYoung realized how many families are lacking basic cooking resources.
John P. Parker is a relatively small school – 263 students at last count. It's about 95 percent economically disadvantaged, a measure that looks at how many students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. It's the sort of school, said 38-year-old Be Madison, a parent volunteer, where a free meal on Fridays can make a big difference.
It's a “sigh of relief” for parents, Madison said, “to know they're not going to have to worry about dinner.”

Madison is trying to change how they shop and cooks, they said. It's a learning process. And she's learning a lot from La Soupe. It turns out it's pretty easy to stick to a budget, they said – “once you eliminate hot Cheetos and Kool-Aid.”

“You can't do something you've never been taught,” they said. “… If we can teach parents how to feed the kids, then the kids will know how to feed their children.”
As the tri-state emerges from the recession and more people land jobs, one side effect is they get kicked out of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, said Freestore Foodbank President/CEO Kurt Reiber. In the past, the freestore would serve roughly 8 million meals a year, Reiber said. This year, it's on track for 23 million.
The goal is to get people to self-sufficiency, Reiber said, where they can shop, cook and eat well on their own. He's glad programs like La Soupe are drawing attention to the issue and fighting for change.
'Woo! Cardoons!'
DeYoung's father died in middle age, and they started their first restaurant, in part, to carry on their legacy. They were a great chef who didn't get to cook long enough, they said.
With La Soupe, though, they started it because they didn't have a choice. They couldn't help it. They couldn't stop thinking about how much food gets thrown away.
And while there are a lot of programs that focus on food, they like their model because it leans on chefs.
The challenge, said Orchids at Palm Court Executive Chef Todd Kelly, is using vegetables – "icky" vegetables – to make food kids will like. La Soupe drops off produce once a week at Orchids, Kelly said, and it's like a puzzle figuring out what to create.
Once, it was about 50 pounds of potatoes and a dozen stalks of celery, Kelly said. Another week, it was artichokes and cardoons. Those fiber-heavy thistles are great, Kelly said; “I absolutely love them. … But it's not exactly a fan favorite, where kids are going, ‘Woo! Cardoons!.'”
Kelly committed to La Soupe about six or eights months ago. Orchids included, the Bucket Brigade is now 19 members strong.
"It's not going to solve world hunger," Kelly said, "but it's definitely going to help do a dent."

Run, run, run
La Soupe has a café location on Round Bottom Road near Newtown. It's French, but it's on a rural street in eastern Cincinnati. The next street over is dubbed “Heroin Alley” for the number of overdose victims it sees. La Soupe's slogan is “A French Roadside Soup Shack,” words not often stuck together.
It's closed on Mondays. But, frankly, La Soupe is not very good at being closed. Shortly before noon one Monday, an order came in for seven croque monsieur sandwiches and as many soups. OK. Then, it was a steady line of customers – some regulars stopping by to chat; a hungry couple out for a walk with their horse-sized dog; a girl, weary of sandwiches for lunch, who heard about La Soupe through a friend.
It's always like that, DeYoung said. Always busy. Always running. Always brainstorming the next big idea.
CLOSE La Soupe, a non-profit that rescues, transforms and shares food to food-insecure families, primarily by making soup, has started cooking classes for teens using crockpots.
In Lower Price Hill one day, they and a few La Soupe volunteers are teaching some Oyler High School students how to make cookies. Several are perplexed by the mixer. They've never seen one before.
That's the reality, DeYoung said. A lot of the students they meet don't have an oven at home. One girl said their family doesn't have a fridge.
The Oyler cooking class was DeYoung's first, and it meets every Monday after school. Each student has a Crock-Pot now, and when DeYoung teaches a recipe, they send everyone home with enough ingredients to replicate it for six people. That way, they can go home and cook for their families.
One Monday, they learned how to make Crock-Pot lasagna. Another, it was chicken cacciatore. Junior Chris Lewis was there. They love the cooking class because it gives them a reason to show up for school.
“You know how Mondays are,” they said.
Lewis, 18, wants to be a chef once they graduate, and in fact, he's starting an apprenticeship this summer with Cincinnati chef Jean-Robert de Cavel. That's the result of connections Lewis made through DeYoung and La Soupe.
DeYoung loves Lewis' story, because chefs are always bellyaching about how they can't find quality employees. Well, here's the answer, they said: They can volunteer with La Soupe, teach cooking classes, and find and train their own future chefs.
Problem(s) solved.

The anonymous author of the Gospel of Matthew, writing close to the end of the first century, penned the following words upon the lips of their legendary leader, Jesus:
They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.
~Matthew 7:15-20
Well then, what are we to make of the voluntary martyrs of the ante-Nicene period, whose blind and zealous dedication to this suicide cult saw their bodies burned, beaten, and devoured by lions? [1] These manipulated martyrs' suicidal ambitions provoked numerous Roman officials to plead with them to stop aggressively goading their own martyrdom, with one Roman proconsul exclaiming:
“Unhappy men! If you are thus weary of your lives, is it so difficult for you to find ropes and precipices…?” [2]
What are we to make of the Church's pact with that vile and vicious emperor who relished in their own son's execution and of whom it was recorded boiled their wife alive? [3] And should we also fail to acknowledge that had they not formed this alliance with Constantine, Christianity would probably not be a major religion today? [4]
In what manner do we apply “Matthew's” teaching to the brutal acts of the Christian emperor Theodosius, whom Christians adoring refer to as ‘the Great' – a man who was politely pardoned by the Church for slaughtering over 7,000 men, women and children in a single sadistic rampage? [5]
How should we reconcile this anonymous author's words with the heinous murder of the brilliant female pagan philosopher Hypatia? This noble, virtuous and enlightened woman who taught philosophy, mathematics and other branches of valuable knowledge had their clothes stripped from their body in a church in Alexandria, their skin shaved off by sharp tiles and their bleeding body burned by true Christians, one of whom was called Peter the Reader, and they took great pleasure in reading from the very pages of that rancid-fruit-manufacturing-manifesto, the Holy Bible, as their flesh sizzled and crackled in the fires kindled by the faithful. [6]
If these fruits don't appear poisonous enough, how do we begin to interpret the words of “Matthew” in the face of the innumerable crimes committed by the numerous vicars of Christ, whose murderous exploitation knew no bounds? [6] And what should we make of the popes of today, those theological descendants of St. Peter who deny life-saving protection to HIV ridden countries, and who have made it their business to carefully conceal and protect paedophile-priests?
How do we understand the words of this dishonestly named gospel in relation to Martin Luther's commissioning of the mass slaughter of Anabaptist and peasant men, women and children, or their violent exhortations to slaughter the Jews wherever good Christians should find them? [7]
And What about Calvin's foul deeds? Are we allowed to keep these verses in mind when we reflect upon the murder of Michael Servetus, who, at the behest of Calvin, had their body beaten and burned as they gasped for breath and bravely clung to life while their flesh excruciatingly dripped from their bones? [8]
Do we pay heed to the Gospel of “Matthew's” advice when we examine St. Francis Xavier's brutal inquisition in Goa? This Christian inquisition, at least in the words of contemporary and modern Catholic historians, resulted in some of the most appalling crimes ever committed? In the words of one Catholic historian:
The Inquisition Laws filled 230 pages and the palace where the Inquisition was conducted was known as the Big House and the Inquisition proceedings were always conducted behind closed shutters and closed doors. The screams of agony of the victims (men, women, and children) could be heard in the streets, in the stillness of the night, as they were brutally interrogated, flogged, and slowly dismembered in front of their relatives. Eyelids were sliced off and extremities were amputated carefully, so that a person could remain conscious even though the only thing that remained was their torso and a head. [9]
How should we go about reconciling this falsely attributed teaching to the misogyny, homophobia, paedophilia, simony, larceny, witch burnings, heresy hunts, Crusades, and all of the other despicable deeds committed by this profane religion – and if we were to present these rotten fruits to the mysterious author of “Matthew”, what do you think they would have to say about it all?
By their fruits shall ye know them!

The editors at Best Colleges Online decided to research the topic of The Paywall Trend
- There are 300 newspapers with some form of online paywall in place.
- And that number has doubled in just the last year and continues to grow.
- Some include:
- The New York Times
- 49 of the Gannett's 80 community newspaper markets
- 6 of Lee Enterprises publications
- But will introduce digital subscriptions in most of its 52 markets by the end of 2012.
- The Los Angeles Times introduced its subscription plan in March 2012. What's driving this trend?
- The search by publishers for new revenue sources to offset declines in print revenue. The Ring Leader
- NYT started it's paywall in March 2011
- Since then the publication has announced it has enrolled 454,000 paid subscribers.
- And saw its daily circulation jump a massive 73.05% over the previous year to 1,586,757.
- NYT subscribers pay between $15 and $35 per month for the digital version of The Times.
- Depending on whether they opt for access to smartphone and tablet apps.
- Subscribers to the print version of The Times receive unlimited digital access at no additional cost.
- After NYT rolled out its paywall in early 2011, 41 American papers adopted paywalls in the third quarter of 2011.
- Up from 10 the same period the year before.
- Many, including the publishers of The Chicago Tribune, which will install its own digital paywall later this year, have pointed to the success of The New York Times's metered access model in support of their own. How much money do paywalls bring in for publications?
- Digital circulation now accounts for 14.2 percent of newspapers' total figures, up from 8.66 percent last year.
- However, NYT expects it's paywall to be revenue neutral.
- The amount of money they expect to bring in from online subscriptions is pretty much equal to the amount of money they expect to lose from online advertising.
- They expect circulation revenue to climb 25% by the end of 2013
- Gannett also projected that their paywalls and price increases would bring in an additional $100 million in annual operating earnings during 2012. But with paywalls comes traffic loss

- In 2010, Daily Variety, the big Hollywood trade magazine, put up a paywall.
- They claimed that by doing so they wouldn't have to cover "gossip, half-truths and anonymous rants."
- Over years the publication became less and less popular which resulted in its recent sale.
- The new owners have announced that the paywall will be coming down.
- Johnston Press - Whitby Gazette
- Paywall was put up November 2009 and taken down March 2010
- What happened? Number of paid subscribers were reportedly in the low double digits.

After a few short months git 2.2.0 has been declared final. This is big news, as it comes with a host of new useful features for improving your git workflow. Here's the stuff we found useful at Atlassian:
git archive learned pathspecs
git archive is a command that lets you generate a zip or tarball of your repository contents at a particular revision. At Atlassian some teams use it to distribute the source code of our tools to our customers. As of 2.2.0 you can limit which files are included in the generated archive by using a pathspec (similar to an antglob ). This can be useful for extracting files of a certain type from your repository - such as documentation or static web resources. For example, you could extract the HTML man pages for git 2.2.0 into an archive named docs.zip by running the following command in the git project's repository:
git archive -o docs.zip v2.2.0 'Documentation/*.html'
git config became a little friendlier
For first time git users, git config will now auto-generate a .gitconfig with a username and email address based on their username, hostname and environment variables (like $EMAIL , if it's set). This doesn't affect existing users, but it's nice to see the ongoing commitment the git team have to smoothing out git's on-boarding experience.
git stash list can now display patches
git stash is a handy little command that bundles up changes from your working copy and stashes them away so you can quickly switch context to work on something else. git stash list can later be used to display what you've previously stashed away. This is great! I'm perpetually distracted and contribute to several different projects, so recalling what's on my stash stack isn't always easy. However, the default output isn't always as useful as it could be:
$ git stash list stash@{0}: WIP on master: 1347163 Merge branch 'release/1.1.4' stash@{1}: On feature/ACDEV-1172-fileless-connect-addons: oh god why stash@{2}: On feature/ACDEV-1208-move-shcemagen: docs refactor take 2 stash@{3}: On feature/ACDEV-1208-move-shcemagen: ugly munging of schema
Since I usually run git stash whilst under some pressure to fix something quickly, I don't always come up with the most descriptive messages (or, as in the case of stash@{0} above, I don't specify one at all and git substitutes in "WIP"). These messages are transitory in nature, so they don't matter in the long run, but it does make recalling exactly what's been done in each "stash" a little tricky.
According to the documentation, git stash list can be passed any option that you might pass to the git log command to format the output. Armed with this knowledge, you might reasonably think that you could pass the -p flag (or --patch ) to git stash list to print out the diffs of each of your stashes.
However, prior to git 2.2.0, you'd be wrong.
$ git stash list -p stash@{0}: WIP on master: 1347163 Merge branch 'release/1.1.4' stash@{1}: On feature/ACDEV-1172-fileless-connect-addons: oh god why stash@{2}: On feature/ACDEV-1208-move-shcemagen: docs refactor take 2 stash@{3}: On feature/ACDEV-1208-move-shcemagen: ugly munging of schema
The reason git stash list -p didn't display anything useful is due to the way a stash is stored by git. Just like almost everything else in git, it's stored as part of the DAG. A stash is actually stored as two commits:
a commit containing any changes that were staged when you ran the git stash ; and a commit containing any changes that hadn't been staged when you ran git stash . This commit has the "staged changes" commit and your previous HEAD as parents.
If you've stashed something recently, you can see this structure yourself by running:
git log --graph --oneline stash@{0} * eebf8fa WIP on <branch_name>: <prev_commit_message> |\ | * 56206d3 index on <branch_name>: 2b2e5c3 <stash_message> |/ * 2b2e5c3 <prev_commit_message> * ...
Because the stash is a merge commit with two parents, -p will refuse to generate a patch because it doesn't know which parent to diff against. As of git 2.2.0 git-stash.sh (that's right, git stash is implemented as a shell script) passes the -m and --first-parent flags on to the underlying git log command, so you can now use git stash list -p to show the actual patches that you've stashed away:
$ git stash list -p stash@{0}: WIP on master: 1347163 Merge branch 'release/1.1.4' diff --git a/pom.xml b/pom.xml index 07131d7..dd9b1db 100644 --- a/pom.xml +++ b/pom.xml @@ -3,7 +3,7 @@ <parent> <artifactId>atlassian-connect-api-parent</artifactId> <groupId>com.atlassian.plugins</groupId> - <version>1.1.4-RC-SNAPSHOT</version> + <version>1.1.4</version> </parent> <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> stash@{1}: On feature/ACDEV-1172-fileless-connect-addons: oh god why ...
git fast-export is now anonymizable
Not so much a workflow feature as it is useful for those who develop git-related tools (like us!). git fast-export now accepts an --anonymize flag that replaces potentially sensitive repository content with innocuous strings. This means our support engineers can get customers to send us anonymized versions of their repositories when they run into problems with git or our software.
The new flag is also useful if you run into a hairy git problem and you want to post your repository structure on a forum without exposing your actual source code.
$ git fast-export v2.2.0~1..v2.2.0 blob mark :1 data 105 * whitespace=!indent,trail,space *.[ch] whitespace=indent,trail,space *.sh whitespace=indent,trail,space blob mark :2 data 3667 /GIT-BUILD-OPTIONS /GIT-CFLAGS /GIT-LDFLAGS ... $ git fast-export --anonymize v2.2.0~1..v2.2.0 blob mark :1 data 16 anonymous blob 0 blob mark :2 data 16 anonymous blob 1 ...
Signed pushes
This item is a big win for security minded folks. Git has supported signing tags and commits for a while, which verify that a particular person created a certain ref or commit. Mike Gerwitz tells a great git horror story about why you might want to deploy one or both of these techniques.
As of git 2.2.0, you can sign the actual act of updating refs which occurs during a push. This is an important step in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and any other unauthorized updates to your repository's refs. git push has learnt the --signed flag which applies your GPG signature to a "push certificate" sent over the wire during the push invocation. On the server-side, git receive-pack (the command that handles incoming git pushes) has learnt to verify GPG-signed push certificates. Failed verifications can be used to reject pushes and those that succeed can be logged in a file to provide an audit log of when and who pushed particular ref updates or objects to your git server.
GPG signing of pushes (or commits and tags for that matter) involves quite a bit of co-ordination overhead and the security benefits aren't worth the hassle for many teams, particularly if you're already hosting on a secured server with audit logging capabilities (such as Atlassian Stash). But if you're interested in learning more, check out the man pages for git receive-pack and git push for details on the new signing options.
git help everyday
Invoking git help everyday now displays the "Everyday Git in 20 commands or so" man page that's bundled with git. This is a decent reference, but can be a little brisk for developers who are relatively new to git. If you're looking to boost your git knowledge, I'd recommend checking out our git site at atlassian.com/git for usage patterns and workflow advice, and then diving into the Pro Git ebook for a deeper look at how git works under the covers.
Pretty formats now support %D for no frills decoration
If you're into git aliasing, you may have already pimped out your git log command with a pretty format. Filipe Kiss has put together a colorful log alias that incorporates many of the important elements of your git history.
Previously, the only way you could incorporate ref names in your log output by using the %d symbol, which expands to " ($refnames)" . This is awkward if you want to use something other than braces in your otherwise highly customizable log output format. As of 2.2.0, the %D symbol substitutes to a plain comma-separated list of ref names (tags, branches and HEAD ) or the empty string if there are no refs pointing at a particular commit.
Performance, bug fixes and other improvements
As usual, the git team have managed to squeeze yet more performance from their already blazingly fast VCS, and have rectified some issues from earlier releases. For the full list of changes you can view the release notes or check out the repository yourself and see what's changed between tags with:
git log v2.1.0..v2.2.0

Earlier this summer, I realized AngularJS was going to be f'ing huge.
I don't just mean it was going to be the next hot thing that would be here for a few months only to be replaced a few months later.
By huge, I mean it was going to change the entire frontend development industry forever, with ripples felt across all aspects of the tech industry.
Like most people, when I first started learning Angular I found it to be a very high quality foundation for building great apps, and doing it quickly. Testability, dependency injection, separation of the logic/view layer, and designer-developer harmony are all great things us devs can get behind, and Angular had it in spades.
But we all know it's hard to get by on just merit alone, and the verdict is always going to be out on whether Angular is really technically better than the alternatives (developers are notoriously unwavering when it comes to tech wars).
No, in order for a technology to be truly, incredibly successful, it needs to become more than just a quality framework. It has to become a platform.
Historically, massive platforms are rare in the world of developer tools, especially relative to how many frameworks, libraries, and languages pop up each day. Technology can be stubborn about evolving from a tool in a toolbox into an entire sub industry on its own.
But it happens. Some recent success stories are Java, .NET, and jQuery. Each one of these technologies created entire sub-industries, providing opportunities for entrepreneurs to build interesting and valuable companies for those in the community, developers the chance to find high paying jobs with new required skill sets, and educators with passionate students ready to learn the next big thing.
It was a few weeks ago at the first ever AngularJS conference, ng-conf, that all of my assumptions about Angular were proved true.
As one of the first sessions at the conference, I spoke to an overflow room of passionate devs, project managers, and even execs about our mobile framework built to harness the power of Angular and make it easy to build great native-feeling apps with web technologies they already knew and loved.
After the talk, I wound up chatting to developers from companies as big as Bank of America and TSYS, to 10k employee financial firms. They all told the same story: their bosses were directing entire dev teams to switch to Angular. They were even paying for AngularJS training and tools!
Over the next few days of the conference, the crowd of over 700 AngularJS fans reiterated the impact AngularJS had on their job. It wasn't just a fun framework that a few rogue developers slipped into a project. It was actually being mandated from the top down, changing job requirements almost overnight.
The reality is that AngularJS is winning the frontend framework war. It's not to say there aren't great, high quality alternatives out there, but few have gained so much developer mindshare that slow and conservative companies see it as a wonderful investment. And it's all the better that normal developers actually love developing with it!
For individual developers this means an investment in Angular is a safe bet that will pay off handsomely over the coming decade. For entrepreneurs, it means building companies that help AngularJS developers and teams can generate some pretty great returns. For managers, it means it's time to rethink which technologies your team should invest in, and what skillsets you'll need to hire for in order to build the increasingly complicated and powerful frontend apps users expect.
And if you need convincing that AngularJS is the future, this graph of Google Search Trends should help:

HARLEM, Manhattan – The Hip Hop Hall of Fame and Museum is set to open in just weeks with a goal to remember and inspire.
It was actually founded in 2006, but will now have a building on 125th Street in Harlem.
The museum will have exhibits on how artists such as Run-DMC, Slick Rick, Fat Joe, Missy Elliott and Kurtis Blow launched their careers from the streets to stardom.
It's not just old school, it's an ongoing salute to hip-hop artists of today.
Something music writers say is a sound that continues to affect every piece of music we listen to today.
"Hip hop is a sound that's felt by everyone, no matter your race - the music relates to everyone," says Alex Gale of Billboard Magazine.
The Hip Hop Hall of Fame will also have a strong educational base and programs for youth teaching creativity as an option to succeed in life.
Have you heard about the 23-year-old Saudi journalist who tweeted an imaginary conversation with Muhammad? It went something like this: They loved Muhammad, they hated Muhammad, they couldn't understand Muhammad, they aren't going to pray for Muhammad. If this isn't exactly a disquisition on faith and doubt a la "The Brothers Karamazov," remember, we're just talking Twitter.
If you haven't heard of this young man, whose name is Hamza Kashgari, it could be because you're watching too much Fox News. As of this writing, almost a week after the Kashgari story broke, I haven't found a single story about it at the Fox News website. (You try: www.foxnews.com.) Meanwhile, CBS, NBC, ABC, MSNBC and CNN have all reported the Kashgari story, clueing in their viewers on how far totalitarian Islam, Saudi style, will go to exert its control over the human spirit. But not Fox.
Say -- you don't suppose the fact that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal owns the second-largest block of stock (7 percent) in News Corp., Fox News' parent company, not to mention a new $300 million stake in Twitter (almost 4 percent), has anything to do with Fox's silence on this Saudi black eye of a story? After all, it was Saudi dictator King Abdullah -- Alwaleed's uncle -- whom press accounts credit with ordering the tweeting journalist's hot pursuit and imprisonment. And it is Saudi Arabia's adherence to Islamic limits on free speech that is driving Kashgari's ordeal.
Maybe it has become institutional Fox thinking to let such news slide for fear of offending the Saudi prince -- or for fear of risking the kind of exposure that might remind viewers of Fox's connections to Saudi regime interests via Alwaleed.
As I've argued in the past, it is these connections that make it incumbent upon News Corp. to register as a foreign agent. (So, too, should universities that accept Saudi and other Islamic millions to open departments of Islamic studies.) Fox's silence on this bell-ringer of a story reinforces the sneaking suspicion that, conscious or not, there may be an Alwaleed effect on Fox coverage which, in a conflict of interest, actually serves the House of Saud before Fox viewers.
Prediction: I don't believe Hamza Kashgari will be executed or even face hard time for their Twitter "blasphemy." Despite widespread enthusiasm for their demise among their fellow Saudis -- at last count, a Facebook page titled "The Saudi People Demand Hamza Kashgari's Execution" had a whopping 23,000 members -- I'm guessing Kashgari's already publicized repentance will be accepted by Saudi poobahs. The crisis will likely end in a gesture of royal magnanimousness. The new "moderation" of the Kingdom -- see, they don't kill you for tweeting! -- will become the story of the day, maybe even "fair and balanced" enough for Fox News to cover it.
That would make it a win-win situation, at least when it comes to Islamic law enforcement: Saudi Arabia gets international "modernization" brownie points, and no one dares break Shariah inside the country anyway, particularly given the bloodthirsty scorn of the Saudi public. (Remember that Facebook community of execution-for-"blasphemy" enthusiasts.) No "blasphemy," no "defamation," no problem.
This same issue is part of a much larger story, a terrifying point of parley between the Islamic world, as represented by the Saudi-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and the Free World, as led, still, by the USA. Why terrifying? Any accommodation of Islamic so-called blasphemy law is an unconstitutional erosion of American free speech.
I'm mortified to report that the USA, as represented by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is working itself into sync with the Saudi, OIC and, apparently, Fox positions that silence on Islam is golden. Last summer, Clinton, while meeting with the OIC in Turkey (where they throw journalists who cross the state in jail) to discuss "defamation" of Islam, promoted a de facto censorship of Islam's critics by calling for "some old-fashioned techniques of peer pressure and shaming, so that people don't feel that they have the support to do what we abhor."
Funny, but I don't think Fox covered the secretary of state's menacing comments about free speech. Not even a tweet's worth.
Image caption About 40 villagers from Ipplepen have been helping at the excavation
An Iron Age settlement unearthed in Devon has been described as one of the most important finds of its kind.
It was prompted by the chance discovery of Roman coins in fields at Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot about four years ago.
Archaeologists, who have recently started examining the site, said it is the first of its kind in the county.
The excavation is being funded by the British Museum, Exeter University, the Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS) and Devon County Council.
Sam Moorhead from the British Museum said they believed the Ipplepen site was "one of the most significant Roman discoveries in the country for many decades".
The site was discovered by local metal detector enthusiasts Jim Wills and Dennis Hewings, who contacted archaeologist Danielle Wootton, the Devon finds liaison officer for the PAS.
'Electric atmosphere'
Ms Wootton said local people had been involved in the project, with about 40 volunteers helping at the excavation site.
"When we announced the find at a community meeting about three years ago, the hall was absolutely packed with local people and there was an electric atmosphere," they told BBC News.
"The bit we've excavated at the moment is prehistoric - it's Iron Age - but we have picked up traces of some Roman Romano-British field boundaries," they said.
Image caption The British Museum said the Ipplepen site was one of the most significant Roman discoveries in England for decades
"It's probably going to take us a very long time for us to fully understand the nature of the settlement and how long it was occupied for.
Ms Wootton said the important discovery should be credited to Mr Wills and Mr Hewings who had painstakingly recorded "every scrap of metal" they found.
"Jim and Dennis have been absolutely first class in recording what they've found and it's a result of them being responsible with their metal detecting that we've discovered this site," they said.
Mr Wills said the oldest coin they found dated back to 117BC,
"The very first Roman coin I found strangely enough - and this is out of more than 100 coins we found subsequently - is still the oldest of all the coins," they said.
"I've been detecting for many years, but it's always thrilling to dig up something you recognise is really important."
Part of the settlement excavation site will be open to the public on Sunday.
Egyptian army report claims they arrested a Hamas terrorist who admitted their planning to plant a car bomb near undisclosed security target. Hamas denies allegations. By Dalit Halevi, Tova Dvorin
The Egyptian Army announced Wednesday that it had apprehended a Hamas terrorist in the northern Sinai Desert, Al-Arabiya reports.
The terrorist was named as Jumaa Khamis Mohammed Brayha, who claimed to stem from a family powerful in Hamas's ranks.
During interrogation, according to the Egyptian army, the young man admitted that they were intending to blow up a Mercedes parked near a crucial security target.
Hamas has denied that the detainee was among its ranks and says their name is not even included in the register of residents of the Gaza Strip.
Relations between Egypt and Hamas have deteriorated, after the ouster of terrorist faction Muslim Brotherhood from power via a military coup in July 2013.
The Egyptian government officially designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization earlier Wednesday, after Tuesday's deadly attack on a security building in the city of Mansoura killed 14 people and wounded more than 100 others.
The decision is bound to enrage Hamas officials, as reports indicate close ties between the two groups.
Recently, Egypt accused the terror organization of being involved in inciting terror on their soil via the Brotherhood; Hamas has denied the allegations.
Hamas has also been reeling from a months-long siege on Gaza – not from Israel, as it has insisted to the media, but from Egypt. Egypt has been cracking down on terror tunnels and supply lines to the territory, according to reports. The siege has led to shortages in electricity, food, and other resources.

From the New York Times August 19th, just brought to my attention, an article on declining bipartisanship even inside the Senate dining room. Reported by Ashley Parker. Nice work Ashley, getting the word bellow in there. This was about the time Israel was slaughtering civilians in Gaza:
One morning last month [July], Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, the minority leader, was dining with Richard H. Anderson, the chief executive of Delta Air Lines. When the two men stood up, Mr. Anderson stopped by the table of [NY Senator Chuck] Schumer, who was there having breakfast as well. The Federal Aviation Administration had begun a ban, since reversed, on flights to Israel. “Fly to Israel!” Mr. Schumer urged Mr. Anderson. From across the room, Mr. McConnell jokingly warned their guest to steer clear of Mr. Schumer: “Anderson, stay away from him!” they said. But Mr. Schumer was undeterred. Shouting now, they gamely pressed their point. “Tell them to fly to Israel!” they bellowed.
This is a reminder that Israel is not an American interest question but a Jewish question. No one has to lobby/corrupt Chuck Schumer to believe in the Jewish state. That inoculation took place a long time ago, as it did for all Jews of Schumer's generation, and most it took with, but for some it didn't. Like Patricia Marks Greenfield; they know the story.
Also, do you have any question about what Richard Anderson's attitude would be toward the Jewish state?
The Brazilian government authorized sending 1,200 troops to the Rio Grande do Norte capital, Natal, to quell gang uprisings, now in their third day. Urban unrest exploded when the government decided to jam cellular coverage in a local prison.
So far 52 arrests have been made of people suspected of involvement in the attacks. According to Portalnoar, a total of 53 cases of debauchery and destruction of property were reported by Sunday night. Government and other buildings also sustained heavy gunfire. Unrest was experienced in 20 municipalities, according to the Secretariat of Security.

The situation was only beginning to show signs of calming down on Monday, authorities told Brazilian media. But people were tweeting worrying images amid confusion surrounding the hashtag #PrayForNatal, because so few people knew what was going on.

According to Brazilian users familiar with the situation, things got underway on Friday, with 15 buses burned by Saturday, along with local landmark, the Morro do Careca. Public transport was halted, curfews were imposed and shots were heard, according to locals. People were scared to go outside (warning: strong language).

The request to deploy was made late Sunday by Potiguar State Governor Robinson Faria, after buses were attacked and public and commercial sites set ablaze. This was allegedly in direct response to the government installing signal jammers in a local prison in the city of Parnamirim.

A government statement explained this was “due to the exhaustion of the means to ensure safety” and “to combat violence playing the metropolitan region of Natal,” Estadao reports.
"Bus traffic is suspended from Saturday afternoon. The population is unable to come and go. But there is no security to put vehicles on the streets without the support of the PM and the army. There is real risk to people, whether passengers or employees of the companies,” president of the transportation union, Harley Davinson, was cited by Estadao as saying.

Bus traffic was scheduled to restart at 5am Monday.
A press conference held Sunday also discussed the arrest of one of the leaders of the NB Crime Syndicate, John Maria dos Santos de Oliveira, who is widely thought to be one of the organizers of the attacks.
Islamic State group extremists allegedly planning to attack Queen Elizabeth II over the weekend have been coordinating for months and have people already stationed in the Britain, Sky News reported exclusively Tuesday. While conducting an undercover investigation into the online recruiting techniques of the Islamic State group -- also known as ISIS or ISIL -- Sky News journalists found that senior members of the organization were encouraging Britons to launch lone-wolf attacks within Britain as opposed to traveling to their headquarters in Syria. They also specifically mentioned the plot to assassinate the queen.
The reporters created two fictional personas, one male and one female, that they used to communicate with ISIS recruiters on social media. One ISIS member, who identified themselves as English punk rocker Sally Jones, told the journalists that ISIS "already has a number of potential bombers in the U.K. -- some of whom have been trained in Syria and are ready to attack," Sky News reported.
ISIS reportedly sent the journalists guidebooks on how to raise money and create weapons. When one of the reporters balked at creating a bomb, Jones "revealed they had another potential bomber in Scotland and two others who so far had failed to attack." Then they relayed the plan to kill the queen, which Sky News reported to the police.
So ISIS has threatened attacks on our Queen on Saturday at the VJ commemorations, also ready to attack Britain, I am so scared_ — Karlina☮ (@Latin_Mexcn) August 11, 2015
News of the assassination plot broke when the Mail ran an anonymously sourced story on Sunday about ISIS' intent to bomb the queen at their public appearances on VJ Day, an observance that marks the date Japan surrendered in World War II. Saturday will be VJ Day's 70th anniversary, and several members of the royal family were due to attend commemorative events.
But the Metropolitan Police told reporters that people should stay calm, International Business Times previously reported. "While the U.K. threat level from international terrorism remains severe, we would like to reassure the public that we constantly review security plans for public events, taking into account specific intelligence and the wider threat," they said in a statement. "The public are encouraged to continue with their plans to attend or take part in events as normal.”
The Great American Beer Festival is over, but the beer news keeps pouring out. Renegade Brewing Company and Elevation Beer Company just announced they've settled all litigation pertaining to Renegade's use of the mark Elevation Triple IPA. In exchange for certain financial terms that will not be disclosed, Renegade will discontinue use of Elevation and complete its phase-in of its new mark by mid-2015. The challenge to the validity of Elevation Beer Company's mark is also being withdrawn.
On October 15, Yak & Yeti will open its third location -- and what a location it is! The popular brewpub is taking over the Crystal Rose events center in south Denver, where it will serve its popular beer -- GABF medal-winner Chai Milk Stout, GABF medal-winner Himalayan Style IPA and GF Apple Ale -- and Indian cuisine, including a $10.95 lunch buffet that will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. daily. The new place also has plenty of room for private events -- it can seat up to 300 inside, where there's a raised platform that works as a bandstand -- as well as a large patio.

The Republicans have won a crucial election to deny president-elect Barack Obama and the Democrats the chance of a 60-seat "super-majority" in the Senate.
The Republican incumbent, Saxby Chambliss, held on to their seat in Georgia in an election run-off held because the November 4 vote failed to produce an outright winner.
Chambliss had called on the electorate to back them in order to build a "firewall" against total control by Obama of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives.
The Republican victory means the Democrats have 58 of the 100 senate seats. A majority of 60 would have allowed them to override Republican delaying tactics such as filibusters that could play havoc with Obama's ambitious legislative programme. Instead, the Democrats will have to rely on moderate Republicans to see their bills through.
Another senate contest, in Minnesota, is being recounted and remains in the balance but the Georgia defeat makes that outcome less important.
With 96% of the vote counted, Chambliss took 57% to Democratic candidate Jim Martin's 43%. Martin benefited on November 4 from the big African-American turnout in the southern state for Obama. Turnout on Tuesday, by contrast, was low.
Both sides saturated Georgia with adverts and visits by prominent politicians, including the failed vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, on Monday. Obama, possibly wanting to avoid association with a defeat, did not go to Georgia to campaign for Martin.
In Minnesota, the Democratic candidate, Al Franken, is trailing the Republican Norm Coleman in a recount that has to be completed by December 16. Franken is cutting into Coleman's lead. By last night, with 93% of the total vote recounted, Coleman was only 303 ahead.
New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees filed an affidavit Saturday in Louisiana District Court in support of teammate Jonathan Vilma's defamation suit against NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.
It's the third affidavit that has been filed for Vilma, joining those filed by Saints interim coach Joe Vitt and head athletic trainer Scottie Patton. Brees' filing, like Vitt's, explained the damage that would be done by Vilma's absence, if they are indeed to serve their season-long suspension while the case is in the courts.
"Having been in the NFL for 11 years, I have come to the understanding that great teammates make teams great," Brees wrote. "I believe that my teammates with the New Orleans Saints, through leadership by individuals including Jonathan, have a good understanding of our responsibilities to our organization, team, teammates, the City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana.
"In my four years as a teammate with Jonathan, I have not seen anyone conduct themselves with a higher degree of professionalism, work ethic, responsibility, and genuine care for their teammates."
Brees' affidavit also took aim at the NFL's investigation and sanctions against the Saints in the bounty matter.
Vilma's punishment was the harshest levied on any player involved, due in part to an alleged $10,000 bounty they offered to knock Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game. Brees' claim is in the affidavit, and has been, that they have no reason to believe that allegation is true.

"My understanding is that Mr. Goodell has accused members of our defense, including Jonathan, of engaging in a pay-to-injury program that involved offering financial incentives to teammates to intentionally injure opposing players," Brees wrote. "I have no knowledge of a pay-to-injury program existing, and have yet to personally see any evidence that would substantiate these allegations. In my four years as a teammate with Jonathan, I have found that they are a man of integrity who passionately plays the game of football within the framework of the rules and has respect for their opponents."
Brees also vouched for Vilma's character off the field, trumpeting their role in helping New Orleans recover from Hurricane Katrina, and citing their foundation that works to build schools in Haiti.
They wrote that Vilma's absence "will have a significant impact on our team and within our community. As a professional football player, our platform to reach our communities is directly driven by the manner in which we compete on the field. Therefore, Jonathan's absence on the field will adversely affect their ability to impact the community in a positive way as a leader and role model."
Judge Helen Berrigan has set a July 26 date for a temporary-restraining-order hearing for Vilma. The linebacker will attempt to obtain a preliminary injunction, which would stall their suspension while the case works its way through the court system.
The Saints open training camp on Tuesday.

Image caption Iron Man 3 was the biggest hit of the summer with $408.6m in box office revenue
The US box office hit a record $4.7bn (£3bn) over this summer with a 10.2% increase in revenue from last year.
Films such as Iron Man 3, Man Of Steel and Despicable Me 2 helped boost numbers, despite a summer of flops including The Lone Ranger, After Earth and The Wolverine.
An unusually large number of summer releases also saw cinema attendance rise by 6.6% to about 573 million.
Iron Man 3 was the biggest hit of the summer, taking $408.6m (£263m).
Although a portion of the record revenues can be attributed to rising ticket prices - which increased on average by 27 cents (17p) - industry figures have attributed the growth to a packed summer of films.
John Fithian, president of the National Association of Theater Owners, said the bumper takings were a clear sign of industry strength.
However, they suggested studios were jamming too many blockbuster releases into too narrow a summertime window.
Image caption The Lone Ranger was considered the biggest flop of the summer
"A few of those films suffered because of the congestion," they told Associated Press.
"In January and February of this year, we had very little product and we had very few big budget movies. Maybe one of the takeaways of the summer is: We've got a whole bunch of movies, let's spread a few of them out a bit more and take advantage of the whole calendar."
But Hollywood.com analyst Paul Dergarabedian said the situation was unlikely to change as Hollywood studios traditionally capitalise on the school holidays in the summer months to target the widest audience possible.
Some of the unlikely hits of the summer included lower budget horror films The Purge and The Conjuring, as well as comedies This Is The End and We're The Millers.
While The Lone Ranger - which cost more than $215m (£138m) to make - was the biggest flop taking just $88.4m (£57m) in the US.
DAVIE, Fla. -- Organized team activities are just beginning, and there is a surprise player receiving early raves from Miami Dolphins players and coaches.
Veteran cornerback Byron Maxwell has been mentioned several times by those asked which player is impressing in practice. Maxwell also was arguably Miami's best player in the only session open to the media last week. They did a good job covering receivers DeVante Parker and Kenny Stills in team drills and picked off quarterback Ryan Tannehill for a big defensive play.

Does this mean Maxwell is primed for a bounce-back season after struggling last year with the Philadelphia Eagles? Only time will tell. But the early results indicate that Maxwell is motivated as they try to take over Miami's No. 1 cornerback spot.
"I always feel like I have something to prove," Maxwell said. "There are things on my list that I need to do; I feel like I need to do as an NFL player. It's Year 6, so there is way more stuff to prove. I have a lot of years."
Maxwell is in an interesting spot this offseason. On one hand, he's a new player in Miami's locker room and must prove themselves to teammates and the new coaching staff. However, Maxwell also is the team's most experienced cornerback and has to mentor the younger players at their position.
Maxwell spent the first four years of their career with the Seattle Seahawks and learned their craft under veterans Richard Sherman, Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor. Now Maxwell is the cornerback in the Dolphins' secondary with the most experience and must bring along inexperienced players Bobby McCain, Tony Lippett and rookie second-round pick Xavien Howard.
"It's a responsibility that has to be accepted, regardless of [whether] I like it or not," Maxwell said. "It's one of those things where you can get these young guys and you can mold them. And you can create something like we had in Seattle, something similar to that. I'm looking forward to it."
The Dolphins acquired Maxwell, along with linebacker Kiko Alonso, in exchange for swapping first-round picks with Philadelphia. Miami is happy with the trade because it landed three starters, if you include the first-round selection of offensive lineman Laremy Tunsil at No. 13 overall.
The trade will look even better for Miami if Maxwell has a strong season as the team's top cornerback. Rookie head coach Adam Gase has been impressed with Maxwell.
"I know, offensively, they make our guys better because they know they're going to get a tough matchup every time that they go out there," Gase said. "He hasn't disappointed me one bit. They have been out there. They have challenged the ball. They have done a great job of getting their hands on balls, and it makes it tough on not only the receivers but the quarterback, because that window is tight. When he's covering a guy, it's going to be a tight throw."

Share your thoughts about the prequels in the comments section. Thanks!
TonyDoug Wright is the owner and editor of Champion City Comics.
is to comic book fans whatis to rock and roll fans. It's something that is very popular, held in high esteem, and has few critics. When DC Comics announced that prequels were to be made there was the obligatory Alan Moore comment where they dismissed the project and some angry posts on various comic book forums. The prequel covers were revealed this week and added fuel to the fire.I still believe that this is a bad idea and am uncertain that I'll ever buy an issue of the prequels. Why? Don't mess with success. Remember theprequels? Enough said. Do we really need to be disappointed again? But my opinion really does not mean much because this is the comic book industry and everything is fair game. I'm amazed we haven't seenIs there anything good to note with this project? Yes. First, Rob Liefeld is not associated with this in any way, shape, or form. The writers they have assembled are impressive: Brian Azzarello, J. Michael Straczynski, Darwyn Cooke, and Len Wein. Those guys have a pretty good batting average and I'm slightly intrigued why DC did not ask their golden boy, Geoff Johns, to be part of this project. The artists are also good selections. Adam Hughes, Jae Lee, and J.G. Jones can handle the task of the prequels.When will these comics be released? All we know at this time is that they will be released sometime during the summer which will give us some more time to complain and post and complain some more and post some more.
Will the Diamondbacks or Dodgers come out on top in their NLDS matchup? (Photo11: Michael Chow/azcentral sports)
The Diamondbacks and Dodgers have never played each other in the MLB postseason.
Until now.
Arizona and Los Angeles open a best-of-5 game National League Divisional Series Friday night in LA.
The winner advances to the NLCS to face either the Chicago Cubs or Washington Nationals.
Arizona went 11-8 against Los Angeles this season, but the Dodgers finished with the best record in baseball.

Who has the edge in the series?
Take a look at what MLB writers are saying:
NLDS predictions
ESPN: 20 of 30 experts pick Dodgers
David Schoenfield writes: "What makes you think Arizona can win this series? Four reasons: 1. They won the season series from the Dodgers 11-8 while outscoring them by 28 runs; 2. Robbie Ray dominated them with 53 K's in 31.2 innings and could get two starts; 3. Clayton Kershaw hasn't looked super-awesome since their return from the DL; 4. Good luck getting J.D. Martinez right now."
Bleacher Report: Dodgers win series in four games
Joe Tansey writes: "The Diamondbacks certainly have the bats to keep pace with the Dodgers with a lineup led by Paul Goldschmidt, but holding a lead or playing catch up against the Dodgers pitching staff will be a tough task."
CBS Sports: Three of five experts pick Dodgers
Mike Axisa writes: "A slight edge to the Dodgers over the D-Backs. Los Angeles did of course win more games (104 to 93) and have the better run differential (+190 to +153) during the regular season, but the D-Backs won the the head-to-head series (11-8). Arizona won their last six regular season meetings as well."
Forbes: Diamondbacks win series
Gabe Zaldivar writes: "This is the one matchup the Dodgers didn't want to see this early in the postseason ... The Dodgers still don't know what they will get out of Corey Seager and their nagging elbow, Yasmani Grandal and their streaky bat or Clayton Kershaw who spooks easily in October. The best team in baseball during the regular season bows out early."
Washington Post: Diamondbacks win series in four games
Dave Sheinin writes: "The Diamondbacks went 6-0 head-to-head versus Dodgers in August/September and can throw Robbie Ray twice and Zack Greinke once in a five-game series."
MORE: Diamondbacks fans deliver in NL wild-card game victory vs. Rockies
Washington Post: Diamondbacks win series in five games
Barry Svrluga writes: "There's so much to like about the Dodgers, from shortstop Corey Seager to slugger Cody Bellinger to heart-and-soul Justin Turner to ace Clayton Kershaw. And yet, Arizona won its last six games against L.A. Yes, these were during the Dodgers' swoon, but Arizona also has a better No. 2 starter in all-star Robbie Ray (vs. Los Angeles's Yu Darvish), a bullpen that can compete and the best second-half hitter in baseball in J.D. Martinez (29 homers in 62 games with the Diamondbacks)."
Washington Post: Diamondbacks win series in four games
Thomas Boswell writes: "This is the trendy upset pick but it's also logical, if the playoffs can be logical. The D'backs beat Los Angeles 11-8 in the season, outscored them by 29 runs head-to-head and dominated them in the last two series. It's hard to forget 1-16. The Dodgers, unfortunately, will remember."
nesn.com: Diamondbacks win series
Mike Cole writes: "There's not a team in baseball who should be more confident going up against the Dodgers than the D-Backs, who won 11 of 19 games vs. L.A. There are no secrets between these two clubs, and the reeling Dodgers have their work cut out for them going up against a lineup that features one of the best players in the world, Paul Goldschmidt, and the hottest hitter in the world, J.D. Martinez, who has 24 home runs since Aug. 1."
nesn.com: Diamondbacks win series
Ricky Doyle writes: "The Dodgers' late-season slump, which followed a stretch of dominance, has them looking vulnerable. And the Diamondbacks boast a very potent offense to go along with a steady rotation (anchored by Greinke, Robbie Ray and Zack Godley) that's capable of going toe to toe with the Dodgers' collection of arms."

QUEENSLAND Health managers have been given a prepared script for how to inform staff their jobs are no longer required.
Managers are advised to tell the employees they have made a significant contribution to the department and the public sector.
A copy of the script was passed to The Courier Mail on Wednesday by the Queensland Nurses Union.
"I realise this might come as a shock and may be difficult for you to digest," the script says. "I appreciate this news will have a significant impact on you."
Managers are given two choices on how to explain to workers why their jobs have been cut.
One option is to tell an employee: "You were not the most capable person for the available role. I know you have made a significant contribution to the department and have done some good work, but unfortunately, there were other individuals who were deemed more suitable."
The second, more palatable choice, is to advise the staff member that their position is "no longer required in the new structure".
QNU secretary Beth Mohle described the script as a "ham-fisted attempt" to give guidance to managers struggling to deal with a "disgusting situation".
"The Premier Campbell Newman can say that he's had sleepless nights over this but what about the 2754 Queensland Health employees and their families who are having sleepless nights," they said.
"This is a disgrace. It's economic vandalism. When a government should be doing all they can do to protect jobs, this is going to have flow-on effects, not only for Queensland Health but across the whole economy.
"People just aren't going to be spending money."
Ms Mohle said QNU members were upset at the "clinical" nature of the script.
They said it was appalling Queensland Health managers had been put in a situation of having to dismiss so many staff members.
"It's appalling that staff are having to hear that news as well," Ms Mohle said.
Below are two items sent to the Courier Mail on Wednesday by the QNU, reproduced in full
Item #1: System manager speaking notes for directly affected employees
Suggested manager script for informing substantive employees their role is no longer required in the new structure - one on one
Thank you for coming in today. I understand this is a difficult time.
We've had to make some tough decisions following the approval of our structure. Our branch's core business is now *insert core business*. This means unfortunately not all employees are now needed to deliver these priorities.
It is greatly regretted your substantive position is one of those no longer required here in the *insert branch*. This means that in the near future, you will be offered a voluntary redundancy.
(I understand you have been with the department for *insert timeframe*). You have made a significant contribution to Qld Health and the public sector *insert some examples*.
Consultation about implementation
We are consulting with affected staff and, where relevant, their unions, about the implementation of the changes.
We are investigating ways to avoid or minimise the impacts of the changes.
We welcome your input into this process and welcome any suggestions you may have.
What does this mean?
I realise this might come as a shock and may be difficult for you to digest. I appreciate this news will have a significant impact on you.
Firstly I'd like to explain why you do not have a role in the new structure. Following the *insert how schedule was filled*, it was determined:
*you were not the most capable person for the available role. I know you have made a significant contribution to the department and have done some good work, but unfortunately there were other individuals who were deemed to be more suitable*.
or
*your position no longer is required in the new structure*.
Your options
I would like to ensure you understand your options and obligations.
You will be provided with two options to consider and once the offer is made, you will have 14 days to decide. I'd like to give you more detail now about these options.
Option one
Your first option is to take a voluntary redundancy which includes a severance payment and an incentive payment.
The severance payment is two weeks pay per year of service in the public service and a proportionate amount for an incomplete year of service paid at your substantive level.
The incentive payment is $6500 or 12 weeks' pay at your substantive level, whichever is greater.
These payments will be taxed as a bona fide redundancy.
*If relevant: Please note, being a part time employee will mean your entitlement will be calculated accordingly. There is no provision to revert to full time prior to the offer being made as this is regarded as a contrived benefit *
You will also be paid any outstanding recreation leave and long service leave entitlements.
The offer of voluntary redundancy will include an estimate and a validation of your leave and service history. It will also provide information about any overpayment that may be outstanding. A separation date will be also advised.
Option two
Your second option is to become an ERP, which means you will be given assistance up to a four month period to be placed at level in another vacant role within Qld Health or in another department. We may initiate a review earlier than four months if reasonable placement efforts have been undertaken and a transfer opportunity is unlikely to occur.
If you choose to become an ERP, you will be allocated to the Qld Health Placement Team and they will act as your case manager in this process.
It's also important to understand a voluntary redundancy payment will not be offered to you at the conclusion of the period, if you have not been successful in finding a vacant position.
If at the end of the period, you have not found a position, a review will be conducted. Where a review determines that reasonable placement efforts have been undertaken and it is not appropriate to continue these efforts, the retrenchment will be considered.
You will be provided with an opportunity to demonstrate why proposed retrenchment is not reasonable, before a final decision is made.
If you do not return the letter accepting a voluntary redundancy within the 14 day period, you will be considered to have elected to become an ERP.
Qld Health support for you at this time
Again I want to reiterate I appreciate this is an incredibly difficult time for you and those around you.
Qld Health is here to support you during this time and I would strongly encourage you to utilise the confidential and free Employee Assistance Program for counselling and career advice.
It is important to note, this service can only be accessed while you are still employed at Qld Health so I would urge you to contact them as soon as possible. However, if you have accessed these services prior to exiting the department, you are eligible to take advantage of the remaining number of sessions following your departure.
Employee Assistance Program:
1.http://qheps.health.qld.gov.au/eap/home.htm - contact PPC Worldwide on 1300 361 008 (24/7)
2.Statewide Hotline 1800 239 074 (7am - 9pm every day)
To recap and further information
To recap on our conversation today, you now have two options - to either take a voluntary redundancy or become an Employee Requiring Placement.
Following this meeting today, I will set up another face-to-face meeting with you in two days time to check in. This will be an opportunity for you to ask further questions.
I understand this is incredibly tough and you are welcome to take a break for some fresh air or to phone a family member or friend. Please remember you are not the only one being told this news today. Please be mindful of others who are also affected and remember the expectations of the code of conduct.
Do you have any questions?
If you have future questions, please don't hesitate to ask me.
Thank you for your time today.
Item #2: Email to unions advising of end of consultation period
Thank you for participating in the consultation process regarding the implementation of (HHS/Unit/Branch/Division) new structure.
Your feedback and suggestions have been considered.
Consultation has now been completed and implementation of the changes will now commence.
If you have additional questions or concerns please contact your line manager.
Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has tapped New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead their White House transition team.
“Governor Christie is an extremely knowledgeable and loyal person with the tools and resources to put together an unparalleled transition team, one that will be prepared to take over the White House when we win in November,” Trump said in a statement on Monday.
Christie, themselves a former GOP candidate for the presidency, was an early endorser of the brash Manhattan business person. The governor has been a visible Trump surrogate on the campaign trail, going on the attack against Trump's remaining rivals (before they too bowed out) and against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. There has been speculation that Christie might be tapped for vice president or attorney general in a Trump administration.
This week, Trump is holding an event in New Jersey to help pay off Christie's campaign debt, charging attendees $200 per ticket.
But things weren't always so rosy between the two tough-talking men. In the campaign's early stages, Christie went after Trump for being a "carnival barker" and "entertainer-in-chief." Mere hours after Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, Christie, who has spoken passionately about combating anti-Muslim bigotry, labeled it a "ridiculous" proposal.
Trump reciprocated by attacking Christie over one of the most controversial episodes in their tenure as governor -- the George Washington Bridge scandal.
"He knew about it," Trump said of Christie at a rally in December. "He totally knew about it."
Trump didn't confine himself, as some of their rivals did, to merely criticizing Christie's staffing decisions. They alleged that the governor knew of the decision to shutter lanes on the bridge as a form of political retribution against a local mayor -- which would be a federal crime. Christie has repeatedly denied that they knew of other officials' shenanigans.
But that's all apparently water under the bridge now. Christie is leading Trump's transition team -- a serious position responsible for helping select White House aides, Cabinet members and other top officials in the event of a Trump victory in November.
Never mind that Christie's previous staffing decisions led to the bridge scandal. The people they propose for government posts will likely be tasked with carrying out the Muslim ban they once railed against.
The human brain undergoes marked structural changes with age including cortical thinning and reduced connectivity because of the degradation of myelin. Although these changes can compromise cognitive function, the brain is able to functionally reorganize to compensate for some of this structural loss. However, there are interesting individual differences in outcome: When comparing individuals of similar age, those who engage in regular physical activity are less affected by the typical age-related decline in cognitive function. This study used multiscale entropy to reveal a shift in the way the brain processes information in older adults that is related to physical activity. Specifically, older adults who were more physically active engaged in more local neural information processing. Interestingly, this shift toward local information processing was also associated with improved executive function performance in older adults, suggesting that physical activity may help to improve aspects of cognitive function in older adults by biasing the neural system toward local information processing. In the face of age-related structural decline, the neural plasticity that is enhanced through physical activity may help older adults maintain cognitive health longer into their lifespan.

The Cleveland Cavaliers staved off elimination on Friday night with an all-time great offensive performance. The Cavs scored 49 points in the first quarter and 86 in the first half—both finals records—on the way to a 137–116 win, getting stellar performances from LeBron James (31 points, 11 assists, 10 rebounds, one off-the-backboard dunk) and Kyrie Irving (40 points, seven of 12 from three-point range).
The series now heads back to Oakland for Monday's Game 5 with the Warriors up three games to one. That's a familiar scenario for these teams. The symmetry is almost poetic. Ahem.
“The Ballad of Warriors-Cavs”
Draymond got mad, but they didn't get ejected.
Even Deron Williams scored, which was not expected.
Amazing three-point shooting, the Cavs were on fire.
Refs, meanwhile, were embarrassingly dire.
Groins were punched.
Officials looked the other way.
Draymond wasn't involved, so they had nothing to say.
Irving was unstoppable.
Thompsons Klay and Tristan were fine.
Steph Curry shot poorly with a sweep on the line.
Amazing isn't it? Something to behold.
Three games to one, just as the memes foretold.
Heading back to Oakland, Dubs need to get some sleep.
Rested but rueful, they didn't lock up the sweep.
Eat some burritos, the comforts of home.
Everyone should try to keep Draymond off their phone.
One more loss and the Cavs will depart.
Need veteran leadership, maybe Deron should start?
Excuse me, loud enough for Lue to hear: DERON SHOULD START.
LeBron James, maybe let Deron start in your place?
Everyone calm down, LeBron will handle the demotion with grace.
And one last thing, please take heed:
Dear God, it's a 3–1 lead!

Technology and human activity are so global that they operate together as if they were a geological force. Civilization is altering the climate in the same way that volcanoes do and have done; our agriculture alters the biosphere the way climate has in the past; and now megacities are altering the planetary balances of heat and sea level. The technium is a planetary event.
I describe this global system of technology deployed around the planet as an emerging superorganism. It consists of roads, electric lines, telephone cables, buildings, water systems, dams, satellites, ocean buoys and ships, all our computers and data centers, and all 6 billion humans. But while this superorganism of new and old technology operates at the planetary scale, and reaches all continents, and spans the oceans, and reaches into orbital space, it is a thin and uneven layer on the globe. In fact most of the planet, on average, is in a very primitive state.
Let's draw a grid around the globe with lines that form a square approximately every 100 km (at the equator). At every intersection of these grid lines we'll take a picture for inspection.
There are about 10,000 intersections over the land part of this planet. They will give us a very good statistical portrait of what this planet looks like on land.
Shown are 6,000 images of a possible 10,000 degree intersections on land.
The imaginary grid is the longitude and latitude grid, and somewhat remarkably, over 6,000 of the 10,000 intersections have already been photographed. Intrepid volunteers sign up at a web site called the Degree Confluence that is half art-project, and half adventure storytelling in order to select an intersection somewhere on the globe to visit –no matter how wild — and record their success with photographs including a legible snapshot of their gps proving a bonafide “even” lat-long reading with lots of zeros.
The resultant grid of photos is very revealing (below). Here is a portion of southern China, one of the most densely settled regions on the planet. Each image is one degree intersection. There is hardly a building in site. And for a place that has been intensely farmed for centuries if not millennia, there is a surprising lot of wildness. What it does to show is urbanization.
If we take a random 6 images from the database, we get an even more randomized view of what the planet looks like on average (on land). Here even agriculture is absent. On average the force of the technium is indirect. On average, Earth is rural and wild. Not a virgin, uninterrupted wild, but an un-urbanized rural place. The great work of the cities and megacities are relegated to thin neuronal clusters.
Projections for the year 2050 predict that most of the 8 billion people on the planet will live in megacities, with populations over 30 million. And these megacity clusters will form a network made up of smaller cities over 1 million in population. But these incredibly dense clusters will weave through a countryside that is emptying. It is already common to find entire villages in China, India, and South America abandoned by its inhabitants who fled to the swelling cities, leaving behind a few old folks, or often, no one at all.
This is the pattern on Earth. Extremely dense and vast populations in a network of megacities connected to each other with nerves of roads and wires, woven over an empty landscape of wild land, marginal pastures, and lightly populated farms.
By 2050 and beyond, Earth will be a urban planet, while the average place on the planet will be nearly wild.
Ahmedabad: All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Praful Patel on Friday hoped Gujarat would have an I-league and Indian Super League (ISL) team in the next couple of years.
An important reason for hosting a Mission XI Million festivals in the city's The Arena by TransStadia on Saturday is to ensure football develops and grows in the state of Gujarat.
Local organising committee chairperson of the U-17 World Cup, Patel said, "While it might not be at the forefront at the moment, I will try my best to ensure that they grow in the coming years. We will start from the very base, from the kids.
"Through this MXIM programme, we want to establish a connect with the children here. We will follow this up with an elite academy soon and hopefully in the next couple of years, there will be a team in the League, the ISL as well as the Indian Women's League from this state."
The ambitious project of the Fifa Under-17 football World Cup, Mission XI Million, has reached the landmark of reaching out to 3,132 schools across India.
With the enthusiasm shown by the kids and the historic participation of the schools, MIXIM is well on its way to reach out to 11 million boys and girls in all 29 states before the Fifa U-17 World Cup begins in October 2017.

"Big things come in small packages," the saying goes, and it couldn't be more true when discussing the mouse. This little creature has become a crucial part of human history through its contributions in understanding human genetics and disease.
In a review published in Disease Models & Mechanisms (DMM), genetics researchers from Yale University School of Medicine and Fudan University School of Life Sciences discuss the history and future of mice as a model organism. They predict that the next frontiers in mouse genetics – such as creating mice expressing human genes to create "humanized" mice – will continue to provide scientists with new tools to not only decipher clinical mysteries, but also to test novel therapies and cures.
The review's authors, Duc Nguyen and Tian Xu, discuss the many ways in which scientists manipulate mouse genes in order to study their biology. One such technique that Nguyen and Xu are working on involves inserting a segment of DNA sequence into the much lengthier full genome of the mouse. These insertable DNA sequences are known as transposons. Use of transposons, as well as other genetic tools, allows scientists to disrupt a specific mouse gene and deduce the gene's function by studying the effect on the mouse. The hope is that the research community can combine the results of extensive mouse studies into a comprehensive library to form a functional map of the mouse genome. Such a map will help researchers navigate and explore the even more extensive human genome to pinpoint the genetic underpinnings of human disease.
Not only do the researchers discuss how mice help us understand disease, but they also highlight methods which enable research of novel disease therapies. For example, humanized mice – mice engineered to carry human genes – can provide new experimental systems for testing new therapeutics.
The full review can be found in the inaugural July/August issue of a new research journal, Disease Models & Mechanisms (DMM), published by The Company of Biologists, a non-profit based in Cambridge, UK.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Wednesday detailed how the U.S. central bank will begin to wean the economy off its extraordinary stimulus, even as they stressed it was not yet time to do so.

Bernanke said the Fed would likely begin tightening monetary policy by removing cash from the financial system before it turns to raise benchmark short-term interest rates.
In their most comprehensive description to date of how the Fed aims to dismantle its extensive emergency economic supports, they also said the central bank could soon raise the discount rate it charges banks for emergency loans, but stressed that would not be akin to a tightening in monetary policy.
“Although at present the U.S. economy continues to require the support of highly accommodative monetary policies, at some point the Federal Reserve will need to tighten financial conditions,” Bernanke said in remarks prepared for a hearing of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.
The hearing on the Fed's exit strategy was postponed because of heavy snow, but the Fed released Bernanke's prepared remarks. Some lawmakers have worried the Fed's aggressive stimulus for the economy could spark inflation.
The Fed's willingness to raise the discount rate, which could come before its next policy meeting March 16, signals it believes that financial markets are working better, a precondition for raising interest rates.
The Fed's move toward withdrawing monetary policy accommodation contrasted with the Bank of England, which is contemplating adding more money to Britain's fragile economy.
Bernanke's comments were seen as suggesting the Fed would tighten before the European Central Bank, which is facing debt crisis among some euro-zone countries, boosting the dollar against the euro. U.S. stock indexes were mostly flat.
Big Wall Street firms polled by Reuters last week expect the Fed to raise rates in the final three months of this year.
MONETARY SEQUENCING
The U.S. central bank has pumped more than $1 trillion into the economy after it slashed benchmark rates to near zero to combat the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
While the economy has grown for the past two quarters, the unemployment rate is at a lofty 9.7 percent.
Bernanke said the outlook for monetary policy currently remains “about the same” as it was at the Fed's last policy meeting on January 26-27, and they repeated the Fed's pledge to hold interest rates exceptionally low for an extended period.
They said the Fed could begin by testing tools to absorb the massive amount of reserves it had pumped into the banking system, such as reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits for banks at the central bank, in small amounts to prepare markets.
As the time to tighten financial conditions drew nearer, the Fed could ramp up reserve-draining operations. Absorbing reserves would give policymakers tighter control over short-term interest rates, Bernanke said.
Ultimately, the Fed would increase the rate it pays on reserves banks hold at the central bank as its way to take its foot off the monetary accelerator pedal. Raising the interest rate on reserves would encourage banks to park funds with the Fed, taking the money out of circulation.
The Fed has greatly expanded its balance sheet with purchases of mortgage-related debt as part of its efforts to revive the economy.
Bernanke said the Fed is not likely to sell any of those holdings in the near term, “at least not until after policy tightening has gotten under way and the economy is clearly in a sustainable recovery.”
However, when the recovery has advanced and more tightening is needed, the Fed could sell securities, Bernanke said. Any such sales would likely be gradual and markets would receive ample warning, they said.

DISCOUNT RATE HIKE IN THE OFFING
The Fed will also return its vast array of emergency lending measures to pre-crisis norms, including raising the discount rate and shortening the duration of loans at its emergency lending window, Bernanke said.
The Fed pulled the discount rate closer to the federal funds rate during the severe credit crunch to encourage banks to use it to obtain short-term funding. Before the crisis hit, the discount rate was 1 percentage point higher than the benchmark borrowing costs. It now stands at 0.5 percent, while the federal funds rate is between zero and 0.25 percent.
With the Fed's balance sheet abnormally large, controlling the federal funds rate can be difficult, Bernanke said. During the transition, the Fed will likely communicate its policy stance through a combination of the interest paid on reserves and targets for reserve quantities.
RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's flagship public university is trying to fire a senior professor, accepted the resignation of another faculty member and dismissed an academic counselor for athletes for their roles in the fraud scandal that rocked the school, campus officials said Wednesday.
Steps to terminate University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill philosophy professor and former faculty leader Jeanette Boxill started on Oct. 22, the same day that a scathing report into the cheating scandal was released, campus Chancellor Carol Folt said in a statement. Boxill is appealing Folt's decision, information that was released after a lawsuit by The Associated Press and nine other media organizations.
North Carolina's public records law requires state agencies, including public universities, to make employee records available. That includes records regarding their dismissal, suspension, or demotion.
UNC-Chapel Hill officials had said the disclosure wasn't required until after an employee has finished appealing the decision, a process that could take years.
The report by former U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein found a pattern of fake classes, which allowed 3,100 athletes and other students to earn artificially high grades from 1993 to 2011.
While the sham courses were solely in the African studies department, multiple people around campus knew of them or suspected something but said nothing, the report said. Folt said they were naming Boxill "in light of the extraordinary circumstances underlying the longstanding and intolerable academic irregularities described in the Wainstein Report, as well as their role as chair of the faculty council during a period of time covered by the report."
Campus lawyer David Parker also disclosed that Timothy McMillan resigned after 17 years at the school. They were a senior lecturer in the Department of African, African American and Diaspora Studies, the renamed department where a retired administrator orchestrated and a retired chairperson allowed the pattern of no-show classes and generous grades.
Boxill and McMillan did not return phone messages seeking comment.
Parker also said academic counselor Jaimie Lee was terminated, which was previously reported. The conduct of six other campus employees is being reviewed for possible disciplinary action, Parker said. Any who are disciplined will be identified, Parker said.
Boxill directed women's basketball players they advised into the fake courses, at least twice sought to influence the grades given to students, and acknowledged sometimes editing student papers, the report said.
McMillan "effectively knew what was happening (with the fake classes), even if they were careful not to learn all of the details," the report said. Folt said in October that four campus employees were fired and five others disciplined for their roles in an academic fraud scheme.
Tom Ross, president of the 16-campus state university system, added that they were taking "action involving an individual formerly employed on this campus, now employed at another UNC campus."
Beth Bridger, one of the football counselors named in the report as steering players toward the bogus classes, lost their job at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington the day the report was published.

A darkness so complete.
They felt cold. Looking all around, there was nothing to see. They could not even see their hands or their body below him. They felt as if they were a solitary eye floating in ink.
A darkness that breathed.
They sensed an invisible current; pushing and pulling, silently and steadily. There was still nothing that they could see. Just darkness, ebbing and flowing. They tried to breathe, but realized they did not feel the need.
A darkness that watched.
They were surrounded by an overwhelming presence, the sensation of being watched filled their every thought and they tried to scream but the eldritch shadows absorbed it and… quivered with pleasure?
So cold.
Whispers found their way into their mind, those same disgusting syllables from before:
Lano kala bo'shar lanu novala
They tried to push their hands against their ears but found they had no hands. They were the eye that they had imagined. No longer corporeal.
Pharom car'ana mokkada bah'jah ko se
They gave up resisting the words, and allowed them to flow through their being. Robert became consumed by an incredible despair as each utterance drove daggers into their soul. Icicle daggers crafted from blood.
New words broke through the shouting of forbidden lore from ancient tomes. Clear as crystal and smooth as silk:
“Don't give up, Robert.”
The voice was a man's voice, deep and tired. Robert felt themselves turn to look, out of habit, and nothing in their view changed. The darkness was complete.
“They will find a new game soon.”
Robert now had to breathe, and they felt their body below them being swept along in the icy darkness. The feeling of rushing matter around them pulling at their clothes while their lungs burned for oxygen. They pulled at the darkness around him, could feel an immense pressure pulling them further to their left and they fought against it. To their right, a soft light finally broke through the ink. A soft light.
“Soon.”
The light of the moon: A pale reflection of the sun. Like a small shred of hope fighting to survive.
Turning themselves and pulling their frozen body toward the light, they felt the strong currents whirling around him, pushing their body and pulling them away. They struggled against them with their entire might as their lungs screamed for air, begged for it. Muscles ached red-hot and exhausted as their face broke the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, and they gasped for air only to find salty brine pouring into their mouth.
Robert coughed and gurgled as the waves surged around him, rising and falling. The waves of an ocean are immense to a mere human, and even larger to Robert. Their fear of drowning was one of their most closely guarded secrets. Ever since they were a child, bodies of water made them extremely nervous. They never even took a bath. Panic made them breathe faster and faster and they felt as if no matter how deeply or how often they breathed that they were going to be swallowed up by the murky expanse beneath him. An unknown environment stretched out underneath the surface, invisible and ominous.
A horn blared out through the sound of rushing water. The moon became covered by a passing cloud, and darkness crept over the changing landscape. A large swell brought Robert higher up with it, and they stared at the gloomy waves rolling around them as far as they could see. Blueish black throbbed all over, and to Robert's great joy they saw a lone fishing trawler turning toward their waving arms and screaming voice fighting to be heard over the din of nature.
Shouts coached each other as Robert grabbed onto a life preserver thrown to him, and they began to laugh like a gleeful madman. As they pulled them from the water Robert could have sworn that the ocean itself wrapped around their ankle to try and pull them back — but with another strong yank they were in the boat. Must have been seaweed.
Robert spat up seawater onto the deck, which smelled strongly of salt and old fish. Gagging, they sat back and breathed. They looked from one man to the next, each looking as if they had seen a ghost.
“How the fuck did you get out here? Do you know where you are?” A man stepped forward and stared with awe and…suspicion? The odds of a man overboard surviving in open ocean are very, very slim. Robert stared back, at a loss for words.
“Answer me when I talk to you, stranger! HOW THE FUCK DID YOU GET OUT HERE?!” The man crouched in their yellow, rubber overalls in front of Robert and looked at them with a now complete lack of trust. Their breath was the same as the boat, but with the distinct smell of cigarettes. They grabbed Robert's sopping wet shirt with a large hand and whispered hatefully into their ear:
“There's not another boat out here for at least a hundred miles. Not since the armistice… Who do you work for?”
“That's ENOUGH Brillby!!” A thundering voice roared from above and behind Robert's head, followed by two thuds and a groan. The captain thumped Brillby with a fist like a brick, and knocked them onto their ass in front of Robert.
“I don't think this man knows what's going on. He's probably starving and delirious if he's been out here since the skirmish the other day.” They smiled with shockingly white teeth, and put a mostly dry blanked over Robert's shoulders. Robert did not even notice that they were shivering until they stopped. The warmth from the blanket revitalized him.
“Where… am I?” Robert stood and pulled the cloth tightly around him. They were wearing a suit still, the rumpled one from before.
“You're in a very dangerous part of the world right now. More dangerous than usual. How much do you remember?” The captain handed them a bowl of hot soup and started walking them toward their cabin. The crew stood incredulous, whispering as they helped their comrade up. Brillby glared after the two as they went inside.
“I'm Captain Gathers, and this is my ship. As for the crew…” They looked embarrassed, and wiped sea spray from their brow. “The crew is tired. Sorry for Brillby's attitude. With the war and all, it's been hard on fishermen. It's apparently a huge moral conundrum now, but this is all we know!! With the armistice in place the way it was written, what are we supposed to do for work?! How do I feed my family?” They looked at Robert, and saw they were wearing a tattered suit. Gathers' eyes narrowed at him.
“Why are you wearing a suit? Why are you out here? Were you one of those fucking diplomats who got us such a raw deal?” Their eyes accused Robert of something they knew nothing about, and Robert finished their soup with a massive gulp that burned their entire chest on the way down, but the warmth that came from their stomach now made it worthwhile.
“I have no idea what you are talking about. I don't know how I got here or… Who I am…”
Robert struggled to think about who they are. They knew their name was Robert — Robert James Lowman — But who was that? There were no images of family or friends or home that their mind could conjure up. An even deeper fear found its way into Robert's soul: The fear of forgetting yourself.
“Pretty fucking convenient. No matter, I have some friends who would love to have the chance to… talk to you. God damn suit.” The Captain stood and turned theirs back to Robert and began to ruffle around in the cabinet that was behind him. Robert knew what was going to happen, and without thinking their body moved to pick up a wrench from the counter to their right, made their way around the small table. The roar of the new storm on the roof and the windows covered the squeaking sound of their squishy shoes. They raised the wrench high, and brought it down as hard as they could on the back of Captain Gathers' head.
The Captain collapsed, holding themselves up with one arm, trying to stay upright as Robert brought down another blow with the cold iron. They finally slumped over and fell face-first onto the floor. Alive? Maybe. But Robert didn't care either way. The rain was calming to them as it pattered in waves over the small cabin. Their hand and forearm ached, but Robert was safe for now.
Behind where Robert was sitting was a cot next to a small desk with a mess of files on top of it. Curiosity piqued, they slopped over there in their nasty wet clothes. They probably smelled like a dog that dove into a bucket of fish and slept, ate, and shat there for several days.
They sat without a sound, staring at the clutter of papers and files sprawled out in front of him. Personnel files, a workers compensation form, maps of the Atlantic with sharp red lines drawn on it, showing some sort of border going around the entirety of the middle. In the upper right, were the words : “Armistice Borders”. They remembered the Cold War now.
What could that possibly mean? Something about the Soviets?
Robert shuffled the papers into some semblance of organization out of habit, and found a small leather bound book underneath the map. They picked it up and opened to a random page to see handwritten diary entries. A Captain's log. Surprisingly neat handwriting.
“We made it through the blockade by the skin of our teeth. I paid a few communications officers off to cause enough confusion for us to slip through. We took one shot from a destroyer, but it only grazed the bow. If it had hit us head on we would have been fish food. If we can't pull this off, we will be fish food anyway. Fishing is all we know, we can't stop suddenly without compensation! But if we pull this off, we will be rich! So many hypocrites publicly support the armistice but are willing to privately pay a premium for some fresh fish on their plates.”
The next entry was dated a few weeks after that one.
“I know we are being followed, but I cannot tell the men. They are already on the verge of mutiny. We lost two the other night on watch, but I was able to convince the crew that it was an accident of some sort. ‘How could they follow one small boat in the middle of this huge ocean?' I said. Brillby, as usual, was the most vocal opponent. They say friends make the worst enemies… I don't want to be their enemy. We've been in this business together since high school. This wretched conflict has been hard on all of us. And the Armistice has been even harder. A bad peace can be worse than a good war.
How could they have stayed hidden for so long, underneath the waves? I fished for 2 decades out here, and never saw any sign of them… But this whole time they were just beneath the surface. Biding their time. Surprising to me that they didn't attack sooner, if they would have before we had the technology we have now, we would have been toast. Even with the destroyers and aircraft carriers we lost the entire 7th Fleet in the Pacific… Even with help from the Red Chinese. Surprising that the Atlantic fleets held out long enough to hammer out a diplomatic solution, however tenuous. That's why we have to take this chance, and the advance payment was enough for me to start paying off the mortgage again, and get some new clothes for Jason Jr.
The crew is shouting ‘man overboard'…”
Robert got chills as the diary trailed off. What the hell was going on here? Some sort of underwater navy the Russians had hidden? I knew the Russians and Chinese had some bad blood, but this sounds completely beyond the pale. Their thoughts were interrupted by shouting outside breaking through the tumult of the weather. Peeking out one of the windows, they could see a massive wave growing on the horizon. A bell rang out, announcing the advent of an emergency.
The moon grew from behind a cloud, shining onto what Robert realized was not a giant wave. It was the glistening blue skin of some horrible monster. They could see spines covering its back, and a pair of pure black eyes that shone with life. Some sort of great serpent?
Frozen in terror as the rain finally stopped, they could hear the creature rushing toward them, and the spines on its back became clearer, and were not spines at all.
The leviathan was covered in dozens of human-like beings, holding spears and halberds. On top of their heads were strange fins that were translucent in the moonlight. The beings were pure white with a slight blue tint, reflecting the light of the moon. The war beast was nearly upon them, and Robert shut the door to the cabin behind him, and stared at theirs hands.
What was they going to do? What could they do?
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Ballistic missiles could be Israel's weapon of choice against Iranian nuclear facilities if it decides on a pre-emptive attack and deems air strikes too risky, according to a report by a Washington think-tank.

Israel is widely assumed to have Jericho missiles capable of hitting Iran with an accuracy of a few dozen meters (yards) from target. Such a capability would be free of warplanes' main drawbacks — limits on fuel and ordnance, and perils to pilots.
Extrapolating from analyst assessments that the most advanced Jerichos carry 750 kg (1,650 lb) conventional warheads, Abdullah Toukan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said 42 missiles would be enough to “severely damage or demolish” Iran's core nuclear sites at Natanz, Esfahan and Arak.
“If the Jericho III is fully developed and its accuracy is quite high then this scenario could look much more feasible than using combat aircraft,” they said in the March 14 report, titled “Study on a Possible Israeli Strike on Iran's Nuclear Development Facilities.”
Israel, whose jets bombed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 and mounted a similar sortie over Syria in 2007, has hinted that it could forcibly deny Iran the means to make an atomic bomb.
But many experts believe the Iranian sites are too distant, dispersed and protected for Israel's warplanes to take on alone.
Israel neither confirms nor denies having Jerichos, as part of an “ambiguity” policy veiling its own assumed atomic arsenal.
Sam Gardiner, a retired U.S. air force colonel who runs war games for various government agencies in Washington, cast doubt on the usefulness of ballistic missiles against Iran, noting, for example, the robust fortification at Natanz.
This, they said, would require that attackers “burrow” into the targets using multiple, precision-guided bombs dropped by plane: “The American conclusion is that the only way to get deep enough is to put a second warhead into the hole of the first.”
Loath to see further destabilization of a combustible region, the Obama administration has championed engaging Iran diplomatically. Some U.S. officials have signaled unhappiness at the idea of Israel going it alone against its arch-foe.
REPRISALS
Toukan, whose 114-page report frowns on the prospect of unilateral Israeli action, said a Jericho salvo could draw an Iranian counter-attack with Shehab missiles. Other reprisal scenarios include Iran choking off oil exports, hitting U.S. Gulf assets, or ordering proxy attacks on Jewish targets abroad.
Some Israeli experts have been dismissive of the Shehab threat, citing intelligence assessments that Iran has deployed fewer than 100 of the missiles and that, if fired, most would be destroyed in mid-flight by Israel's Arrow II interceptor.
“Under such circumstances, we would expect little more than a repeat of the Gulf war,” said one ex-general, referring to Iraq's firing of 40 Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 conflict. Those attacks inflicted damage but few casualties.
The Arrow II also provides some protection for Jordan, an Arab neighbor of Israel and which Toukan saw becoming “Ground Zero if a ballistic missile exchange takes place.”
They noted that any Jericho strikes on Iran — which has denied seeking nuclear weapons but vowed to retaliate if attacked — would be complicated should Tehran obtain the most sophisticated version of Russia's S-300 air-defense system, which can tackle ballistic missiles as well as invading planes.
Israel could face a further difficulty in mounting a sneak Jericho attack because its strategic air bases are located near population centers. The unannounced test launch of what was believed to be a Jericho III outside Tel Aviv last year became public knowledge within minutes.
But that may be the extent of Iran's forewarning. According to an Israeli defense consultant, only the United States and Russia have put up satellites capable of spotting ballistic missile launches in real time, “and it's highly unlikely that the Iranians would get access to that information.”
The consultant, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, played down the notion of ballistic missiles being used for conventional attacks:
“You look at any major Western military, and you'll see that such strikes are the purview of manned warplanes, while ballistic missiles are reserved for nuclear-strike scenarios.”
I recently had a chance to chat via email with the wonderfully named (really, their name rolls off the tongue) Simone Bevilacqua, creator of the Amiga/Windows (and now /Mac!) game BOH. A little known fact but ‘Bevilacqua' translates literally to “(you) drink the water” or more accurately “water drinker” which seems appropriate as I happen to know that Simone doesn't drink anything alcoholic. I also know what they had for lunch recently.
We profiled BOH previously here at Troll in the Corner. Simone's been hanging around our comments section for a while and was gracious enough to answer my questions after I cyber-stalked them for a bit. A brief introduction to BOH in Simone's own words:
BOH is an original, retro-flavored game of exploration and action. You move in claustrophobic and dangerous battlefields searching for the Evil Masters. This is no easy task not only because of the traps-packed corridors and mind-blowing puzzles, but also because of the countless enemies that the Evil Masters throw at you more and more until you discover them – at that point, you will be attacked directly by the Evil Masters themselves, the toughest of all. Although your quests are made slightly less hard by the bonuses and power-ups scattered all around the battlefield, carrying out the missions demands lots of concentration and quick reflexes.
We'll also be featuring a review of the game in the near future as well as a legally binding promise to stay at least 100 meters away from Simone at all times.
Why develop an Amiga game in the first place?
I am a long-time Amiga user and I use AmigaOS daily for pretty much everything, so it was a natural choice. What was not an obvious choice is making a version also for Windows (and macOS as well, which will be made available shortly): but I had to, if I wanted to sell a few copies more and hope to at least recoup the investment and, since I'm currently unemployed and the future does not look too bright, maybe earn some money.
Have you been active in the Amiga community for a long time and if so, did you own an Amiga when they were being produced and sold to the public?
Yes, I got my first Amiga (only) in 1993 – it was an Amiga 1200 (which I still own). My main machine is now an AmigaOne XE, bought in 2002. I guess that a bit more of context will be of help – but the history of Amiga is a complete mess, so it is impossible to recap it in few words.
Anyway, the situation now is that although “classic” Amigas (A1000s, A500s, A1200s and so on) are dead and gone, the OS that ran on them is still alive: AmigaOS 4.1 is on sale right now and is actively being developed. It runs on “modern” Amigas (like my AmigaOne) which are nothing but PPC-based motherboards which standard parts (graphic/sound cards, etc.) can be mounted on – please note that some of these machines have been recently designed and are currently being sold. AmigaOS 4 is a complete re-write of the classic AmigaOS and has been designed to be easily portable and to be enriched with modern features.
As regards my activity in the Amiga community, I released a number of freeware games, utilities, developer packages etc. and I am a quite regular member of some Amiga-oriented forums.
How long did it take BOH to go from an idea to a product?
That is impossible to say because BOH became what it is now long after it was started. More precisely, on the 19th of July, 2007, I decided to let my frustrated creativity free (you see, back then I was employed as a programmer and I was working at stuff that I deeply hate and that just drive me crazy): I started implementing an idea that had been floating in my mind for a few years. This idea was about wandering around in mazes illuminated a-la Shadowlands (an old videogame) and seen from a top-down perspective (inspiration, as hinted at also in the user's manual, came from Wizard of Wor, Alien Breed, Tail-to-nose and other titles of the past). That idea is now the core part of the game both as regards the technical part and the gameplay. From there, things evolved quite naturally, without too much pre-planning.
Who's been working on development for this? Is it a one man operationor did you have a team of folks creating it?
I did everything, although I received help with the French, German and Spanish translations.
How has it been received?
I do not know if it is a wise thing to do, but in all honesty I have to say that the sales are frighteningly low! At the same time, I have to say that everybody who bought the game is happy with it – actually, most of the customers are really enthusiast! I receive a lot of praise and thanks, and I must say that having managed to share my creativity, my ideas and my passion in such an effective manner is wonderful! I have also received a couple of very positive reviews and many congratulate for having brought an actual product to the Amiga market. For those who want a proof of what I am saying, on the game's website I have collected the links to the comments/reviews people made in public.
What did you have for your most recent meal and was it good?
I had a steak, some potato mash, an apple and water (I love simple things) – and, yes, it was good.
Do you play video games on systems other than an Amiga (or emulated Amiga OS) and if so, what are you currently playing?
I love playing video games, but there is one thing I love more: programming them! Moreover, there are other things in life besides video games. That means I rarely have the time to play. Anyway, recently, while waiting for the release of BOH, I had a break that allowed me to discover a wonderful game: it is a shoot'em-up called “Plural”… and it's for the C64!
Are there any plans for a future title?
I have plenty of ideas for 3 or 4 new games, not to mention that there could be also a BOH 2. However, none of them will probably ever see the light of day, as it all depends on the sales of BOH.
Between the time it took me to send these off and Simone to answer these questions, they also somehow found a few extra minutes to create, test and release a major update to BOH.

Yaya Sanogo has told L'Equipe that they have had teething problems in adjusting to the Premier League but is convinced they will score goals for Arsenal.
- McNicholas: Will injection of pace help Arsenal to title?
- Cox: Why Welbeck divides opinion
Sanogo, who was sidelined for two years by a complicated leg fracture suffered in 2010, has failed to find the net in 16 competitive outings for the Gunners since arriving from Auxerre just over a year ago.
They said: "I needed six months to adapt. I've had quite a lot of problems. I arrived on one leg. It's been difficult to adapt to the league. There's a lack of confidence, perhaps a bit of pressure too. You're 21 and you play up front for Arsenal -- it's not easy."
But Sanogo has continued to find the net at under-21 level for France, scoring twice in last week's Euro 2015 qualifying win over Kazakhstan, and is set to spearhead Les Bleuets again in Monday's home encounter with Iceland.
Those goals have helped keep their confidence up, and they insisted new Arsenal signing Danny Welbeck would not get an easy path to the first team.
"He's going to have to battle for their place in the side," they said. "Last season, I didn't doubt myself. I was more afraid of getting injured. If the coach brought me in, it's because they have faith in me.
"I've become more solid. The defenders can be quite nasty. When you have come out of Ligue 2 and you know that you're going to come up against [Vincent] Kompany, it's quite a thing. But I've gained in experience."
They added: "It's a big club. The fans know that I've scored a lot of goals at youth level, and they're putting me under a little bit of pressure. Once I've scored my first goal, everything will be fine. It's their problem if they criticise me. I'll still be here. I'm going to play, improve and score goals. Sooner or later, it's going to go in."
The direct strike by Israel on Syria's artillery unit was another example of how the conflict in Syria has escalated by spilling into neighboring countries. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have poured out of the country, with more than 408,000 in Turkey , Jordan , Lebanon and Iraq now registered with the United Nations . Shells fired from Syria have killed civilians in Lebanon, and in one episode last month, Islamic extremists attacked Jordanian soldiers on the border with Syria, killing a corporal.
On Monday, a Syrian MIG-25 jet bombed the rebel-held town of Ras al-Ain a few yards from the Turkish border, killing civilians, Syrian witnesses said. Five Turkish civilians were killed in October when a Syrian shell landed in Akcakale, another border town about 75 miles west of Ceylanpinar, an act that prompted the Turkish Parliament to revise engagement rules and allow the military to retaliate in case of a direct threat from the border region.

Israeli military officials have made it clear that Israel has no desire to get involved in the fighting in Syria. Israel had already filed complaints with the United Nations observer force that monitors the armistice agreement reached between the Israeli and Syrian forces after the 1973 war, and the United Nations has warned that the spreading violence could jeopardize the cease-fire between the two countries.
“We hope they get the message this time,” Moshe Yaalon, Israel's minister of strategic affairs, said on Israeli television on Sunday, referring to the missile fired at a Syrian mortar battery.
Israel also confronted fire along another one of its border areas on Sunday, when from morning through nightfall more than 50 rockets fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza struck southern Israel. The first heavy barrage came as residents of this rocket-battered town near the Gaza border were getting up to go to work and school.

The prospect of violence flaring with Syria and with militants in Gaza meant that after years of relative quiet along the country's borders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu finds themselves tested on two fronts. Under increasing pressure and with Israelis scheduled to go to the polls in January, the nation's leaders are talking tough and threatening broader action.
“The world needs to understand that Israel will not sit idly by in the face of attempts to attack us,” Mr. Netanyahu told their cabinet on Sunday morning. “We are prepared to intensify the response.”
But on Sunday, while Israel viewed the fire from Syria as unintentional, though still unacceptable, the rockets from Gaza were deliberately aimed at population centers. Hamas , the Islamic militant group that controls the Palestinian coastal enclave, has claimed credit for participating in several recent rounds of rocket fire.

The latest surge began on Saturday when Palestinian militants fired an antitank missile at an Israeli military jeep patrolling Israel's increasingly volatile border with Gaza, wounding four soldiers. Four Palestinian civilians were killed when Israel returned fire with tank or artillery shells, prompting new rocket fire against southern Israel. At least one Palestinian militant from a rocket-launching squad was killed in an Israeli airstrike.
Responding to years of rocket attacks, Israel carried out a three-week offensive against the militant groups in Gaza in the winter of 2008-9, resulting in an informal and shaky cease-fire. After three civilians were wounded by shrapnel in the Sderot area early Sunday, Silvan Shalom, a vice prime minister from Mr. Netanyahu's conservative Likud Party, said that Israel was “not eager” to embark on another major ground operation in Gaza, but that the military was prepared to act. Yisrael Katz, another Likud minister, called for the liquidation of the Hamas leadership in Gaza and said that Israel should stop supplying the enclave with water, electricity, food and fuel.
As Americans prepared to commemorate Columbus discovering the New World this October, a travel writer from the Washington Post fell asleep on the A train and accidentally discovered Indo-Caribbean people in Queens, New York.
The author, rustled from sleep with the notification of landing in Richmond Hill (colloquially known as “Little Guyana”), arrives spellbound by cheap island treats, the presence of machete-wielding locals, and our “wild” music.
“Nobody told me about Little Guyana, a mile-plus-long stretch in the Richmond Hill neighborhood of Queens where the residents are Indian but sound like Bob Marley when they speak.”
Fortunately for the author, the audacity to express not knowing an entire race of people exists is not confined to the shortsightedness of poorly written and insulting travel pieces “discovering” marginalized communities.
“Actually, [before I met you/moved to New York City/<insert oblivious yet offensive comment of choice here>], I didn't know Indo-Caribbean people existed,” is more common than you might think.
I have lost count of the number of times individuals — white people and people of color alike, including South Asians — I have lost count of the number of times individuals — white people and people of color alike, including South Asians — say they never knew Indo-Caribbean people “existed.”say they never knew Indo-Caribbean people “existed.” Growing up as Indo-Caribbean in America, the question of, “What are you?” unfailingly warrants an unsolicited lesson in the history of Western colonialism. For people of color in America that seem to not visibly fit into race categories assigned to Census boxes, the frustration accompanying this question is common. Yet unlike other elementary school aged children who do not learn about residual systems of slavery and colonialism until middle-school, many of us have an idea about the system of indentureship that brought our ancestors from India to the Caribbean and recite from memory the history lesson our parents inculcated to other kids at recess with blank looks on their faces.
When people say they do not know we “existed,” essentially what they mean is we must be variegated ethnic unicorns appearing as glorious exceptions to dominant American narratives where other cultures and people inevitably are allowed to exist (no history lesson required).
If the individual is feeling particularly apologetic about not knowing about the existence of Indo-Caribbean communities, they will assume the quiet tone of confession, a revelation made in atonement for their lack of knowledge due to intentional historical omissions from subcontinental and American textbooks alike, privileging majority vs. minority politics, and perpetuating our ancestral struggles to footnotes within the domination of British and Western imperialism.
If they are oblivious to the project of white supremacy and the historical distancing of India from the violence of indentureship that allows individuals to say they never knew an entire race of people “existed,” they will write articles like the one published in the Washington Post.
The author, who never knew Indo-Caribbean people “existed,” also assumes:”It's probably safe to say that many, if not most, Americans know little or nothing about Guyana” — Is that safe to say? Why would that be safe to say? Are there also no Guyanese-Americans who do not know their own race exists? Do Guyanese-Americans not exist, or is the assumption that Guyanese-Americans are not “many” or “most” Americans?
Strolling down the community hub of Liberty Avenue, the author states, “Urban grit is rife, but there's no real danger.” I'm not sure whether the author believes our little chutney-blasting, carnival enclave must be a microcosm of island paradise, but as a founding member of Jahajee Sisters, I know that our organization was created following the violent deaths of two young Indo-Caribbean women, and as a direct response to the devastating rates of domestic and gender-based violence impacting the Indo-Caribbean community.
The author's exoticizing account of Indo-Caribbean people stops short as the machete-wielding coconut man requested by the author for a photograph declines the request. But this does not deter the author from observing us National Geographic-style, commenting on local women outfitted in “Western garb.”
The idea that Guyanese communities do not exist invites many, many more assumptions, least of which is the fact that Caribbean communities are not an integral part of the fabric of American identity. America is here, Guyana is over there, and clearly you cannot be Guyanese and American (since clearly “American” identity is a code-word for “white”).
The issue is not simply the lack of knowledge about the existence of Indo-Caribbean people, but the audacity to inherently otherize communities that cannot easily be filed away into dominant race boxes. The issue is approaching this lack of knowledge with humility, rather than from a vantage point of dominant “American” narratives which continue to otherize already marginalized populations whose histories continue to be excised from the chapters of history.
The project of visibility is always a complex one; many The project of visibility is always a complex one.responses to this article — including responses by Indo-Caribbean individuals and organizations — hail the Washington Post for our nugget of acknowledgement which validates our community and the very notion that we exist.
But we must refuse the idea that submitting to concessions for the sake of visibility and validation of the existence of our community comes at the expense of perpetuating stereotypes and inaccurate, reductionist portrayals. As our community continues to be impacted by the silencing of our histories, our narratives, and our people, we must resist the collisions of post-colonialism, white supremacy, and the historical distancing of indentureship from South Asian narratives that perpetuate these systems of power and privilege that continue to allow us to not “exist.”
Suzanne Persard is a writer and activist from New York City who is a founding member of Jahajee Sisters, the first Indo-Caribbean women's organization in the country committed to ending gender-based violence.
The internet never forgets and your two-year old tweets can return to trouble you: activist and former police officer Kiran Bedi was reminded of this when they joined the BJP and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership.
"I joined BJP due to the inspirational leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi," they said at a function where they joined the BJP. "I wanted to sacrifice my entire life to social work. But they inspired me to join political life."
Within minutes Twitter was flooded with screenshots and links to Bedi's tweets questioning Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots when they were the state's chief minister. Tweets with screenshots pointed out that on March 16, 2013 Bedi had tweeted: "One day NaMo will need to respond with clarity about riots massacre. Despite Courts clearing them so far."
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold And she's buying a stairway to heaven. pic.twitter.com/aX1z6nBgUH — Yogi Scotchynath (@scotchism) January 15, 2015
This wasn't the first time they had done so. On April 10, 2012, Bedi had in a tweet reminded Modi that the special investigation team probing the riots had cleared them but that was not the end of the matter.
Bedi, the country's first IPS woman officer, seems to have mixed feelings about Modi though. On the very day of their "clarity about riots" tweet in 2013, they had praised Modi and their "out of the box" ideas in a string of posts.
As BJP president Amit Shah confirmed that Bedi will contest the Delhi assembly elections, people on Twitter also reminded them of the time they had "rubbished" allegations that they supported the BJP or sought public office.
Offering without comments ;-) pic.twitter.com/48t1YgJxHo — Abhisar Sharma (@abhisar_sharma) January 15, 2015
As Bedi posed for the cameras at the BJP's office, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah advised them about 'Twitter history'.
Congress leader Digvijaya Singh wished Bedi well but with sarcasm. "U Turn Ms Kiran Bedi? Or genuine change of heart? My best wishes to you. May God be with you!" they tweeted with a screenshot of Bedi's tweet on 2012 riots.
Speculation about the top cop joining the now ruling party has, however, been strife since time immemorial.
Bedi's political journey started in 2012 when they joined Anna Hazare's anti-corruption campaign. In 2013, however, when their aide Arvind Kejriwal started making political strides with their Aam Aadmi Party, the 'Hazare camp' - including Bedi - was quite vocal about their disapproval of the move.
As the rift widened, Bedi was seen increasingly sympathetic towards the BJP, and has remained so since.
"I thought @thekiranbedi already was in the BJP. :)" -- a tweet by Washington Post's India correspondent Annie Gowen sums up that this sentiment, too, wasn't lost on Twitter.

OpBART began the week with another protest at San Francisco BART stations and myBART.org being taken offline to protest the shut off cellphone service on BART out of fear of a demonstration against the shooting of a homeless man by BART police, the second fatal shooting by BART officers in two years. There was a high turn out of both BART police and SFPD in riot gear, and from photos and video there appeared to be five officers to every protester.
According to SF Appeal, the majority of protestors did not wear Guy Fawkes masks, though some were barely clad. Civic Street Station was closed, and police arrested a man and a woman at the Civic Center station.
San Francisco Bay Guardian reported:
As a few protesters began to gather, surrounded by dozens of riot police and media, a uniformed BART police officer told a young African American man they would be arrested if they raised their voice. Chanting began in response among the small pack of protesters, and the man was promptly arrested by BART police. As they were being led off the platform by police, a woman who stood in the center of the platform began verbally engaging a BART officer, saying, “BART police need to be reformed. Make BART Safe. Make BART safe.” They were apparently arrested for nothing more than their words. Deputy BART Police Chief Daniel Hartwig said they could not provide any information about what the arrestees would be charged with.
The SFBG video of arrest is here.
The crowd, estimated between 80-100, outnumbered by police, moved up and down Market Street. Powell Street Station was opened and closed then opened again. The Ferry Building was closed to prevent protesters from entering. Firecrackers were thrown at the police, and some hooligans pounded on the windows of closed shops. Protesters keep in touch via Twitter.
The crowd chanted
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
as they stood in front the cops. The photo above, of their friend risking a photo, was taken by Vivian Ho who posted it to the #opBART Twitter feed. Other video of march here and here.
Some tweets included
8pm:
4th and Market. Group trying to start fire. Throwing Firecrackers at Police and Crowd? #OPBART-RadioRelay KEEP IT PEACEFUL. WATCH FOR THOSE THAT TRY TO MAKE IT VIOLENT #opBART
Garbage cans were knocked over, and trash was thrown. #opBART twitter and Mission Local reported eight arrests. One commuter was briefly detained after they went after a protester, per SFAppeal. They were not arrested.
UPDATE: Mission Local's Helen Groupil was “detained.” They tweeted at midnight: IndyBay's Twitter feed reported 30 arrests/detentions, including at least one reporter, at 8:43pm local time, and confirmed by the SF Examiner's Twitter feed . One of those arrested around 8:45pm was Mission Local blogger Helene Goupil. Mission Local provided live feed to this protest and last week's.
#mlnow Thx for the tweets everyone, I was able to show police my business card and was let go #opbart
Others arrestees reported via Twitter that they were booked and released.
Hamas political chief Khaled Mashaal told a government-endorsed rally in South Africa on Wednesday that the wave of stabbing attacks against Israelis would continue.
Referring to the terror attacks as “the Jerusalem intifada,” Mashaal told a crowd of several hundred supporters waving Hamas's white-and-green flag in Cape Town that “the uprisings shall continue until freedom is achieved and the land is for Palestine and its people.”
They compared the Palestinian cause to the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa.

“South Africa, you have achieved your freedom, the people of Palestine are aspiring to attain their freedom,” they said. “Do not expect that they should stop with the uprising, do not expect that they should stop with the resistance.”
Hamas is an Islamist terror group that openly seeks the destrucion of Israel.
Hamas's spokesperson in Gaza, Sami Abu Zuhri, echoed Mashaal's words late Wednesday, saying that day's terror attacks in Jerusalem and Hebron “proved that all the tricks used to disrupt the intifada are doomed to failure.”
The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem has expressed “shock and outrage” at South Africa's hosting of the terror group's leaders, and on Monday summoned South Africa's deputy ambassador “for a reprimand,” ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nahshon said.
The ANC's invitation to Hamas “provided a tailwind for terrorism and blatantly and crudely ignored the position of the international community, which considers Hamas a terror organization,” Nahshon fumed.
The Hamas delegation, which also included Mashaal's deputy Moussa Abu Marzouk, was welcomed at the airport Monday by the ANC's deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte, according to a senior ANC official.
“It is to demonstrate that the African National Congress is willing to talk to all people who are positive in terms of their attainment of self-determination and nationhood in Palestine,” the official told SABC News.
Mantashe, the ANC secretary-general, said Monday that their party has signed a “letter of intent” with Hamas. “We have an intention of building a long-lasting relationship,” they said at a press conference with Mashaal, calling the delegation's visit “very important.”
According to a Twitter feed affiliated with the ANC, Mashaal said during the Monday press conference that their organization opposes the “killing of innocent people,” but also called for a struggle against Israel.
“We are insisting with our people to finish this apartheid regime. This racist occupation should be put to an end,” Mashaal was quoted as saying.
The South African Zionist Federation “condemns in the strongest terms possible the fact that a delegation representing the Hamas Central Committee will be visiting South Africa as the honored guests of the ruling party,” a statement by the group read.
“During these past few weeks of barbaric violence targeting Israel, Hamas has enthusiastically endorsed the cold-blooded murder of Israeli civilians and instigated dozens of lethal attacks against them,” the statement continued.
The African National Congress has long been supportive of the Palestinians' struggle against Israel and exceedingly critical of Israeli policies vis-à-vis the Palestinians.
“Contrary to what is claimed, the ideology, values, aims and strategies of Hamas are diametrically opposed to the principles of the ANC, as embodied in the Freedom Charter,” the Zionist Federation declares in the statement.
At a recent summit, the ANC party reaffirmed its support for a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. “Hamas, by contrast, does not support, nor has it ever supported, the creation of an independent Palestinian state co-existing in peace alongside Israel. Instead, its charter explicitly stipulates that no negotiated settlement is possible in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians with Jihad being the only solution,” the Zionist Federation statement read. “Simply speaking, Hamas wishes to destroy Israel altogether and seeks to establish an Islamist dictatorship in its place.”

Let's watch Aaron Rodgers and Richard Rodgers win a football game.
Aaron finished 24-of-36 for 273 yards with two touchdown passes and one interception, while Richard had career highs of eight receptions and 146 yards receiving with the Hail Mary to their name. Aaron led the Packers in rushing with 27 yards on four carries including the touchdown.
He's not the only Rodgers involved in a dramatic game-winning play from Cal. What's even cooler for those who are unfamiliar with the protagonists in the Play: Their dad Richard Rodgers Sr. threw two laterals to set up Kevin Moen running straight into the Stanford band and Gary Tyrrell!
Here is Richard talking about this play postgame

Not to mention on the previous play that set up the Hail Mary, Aaron threw a pass downfield to Richard, who threw it back to Aaron to move the ball up! So there was a mini-Play before the big play! So it was all Cal all the way for the Packers to beat the Lions!

Change can be good; change for the better can be great.
The Dodgers' 2017 season has been an impossible one to forecast from day one to today. They would win 104 games in the regular season, the most in the majors. But it was anything but a smooth, steady path to the playoffs.
When they broke from Spring Training in Arizona, the team looked set with a lineup that Manager Dave Roberts could look at fondly and feel secure moving forward.
But, oh my, did things change.
The first baseman was veteran Adrian Gonzalez, who had driven in 90 runs or more 10 consecutive seasons. Solid as a rock as the cleanup hitter.
Gonzalez' balky back caused them to miss almost the entire season. Instead rookie Cody Bellinger was called up from the minors. They hit a rookie record 39 home runs and became the reliable cleanup hitter.
More: Yasiel Puig responds to Keith Olbermann criticism
All-Star Corey Seager was the shortstop. They had another fine season, but he, too, suffered a back injury, although late in the season, and is not even on the playoff roster.
Charlie Culberson spent almost the entire season in the minors with only 15 at-bats for the Dodgers all year, but is now, because of Seager's injury, the starting shortstop in the National League Championship Series.
Andrew Toles (remember him?), after a promising late season surge in 2016, was the leadoff hitter and left fielder. They tore up their knee in May and was gone for the season.
Seldom-used Chris Taylor took over in left and hit 21 homers and led the team in doubles and stolen bases while solidifying the leadoff spot.
Joc Pederson was the center fielder. They slumped badly in the second half and was sent to the minors.
Taylor moved to center and Curtis Granderson was acquired from the Mets to play left field. When Granderson slumped, Enrique Hernandez, a super sub, was called on to play left in the playoffs – while batting cleanup (Bellinger was moved up a spot because of Seager's injury).

No one knew what to expect from Yasiel Puig in right field. They were the ultimate baseball enigma, talented yet moody. There was even some speculation they would be traded before opening day.
Puig went on to hit 28 home runs and has been the Dodgers' best offensive player in the postseason.
Yasmani Grandal, the power-hitting switch hitter, would be the everyday catcher.
By October, Grandal was struggling against left-handers and Austin Barnes started the first two games of the NLCS.
More: How can the Los Angeles Dodgers be called the best team ever ... yet?
The new setup man for Kenley Jansen would be Sergio Romo, signed as a free agent after a solid career with the Giants.
Romo could never get going in Los Angeles and was traded in mid-season. Brandon Morrow, released by three different teams in their career, became the very effective late-inning relief specialist.
Then there's Alex Wood who began the season in the bullpen. Injuries to starters gave them a chance and they responded with an All-Star season, going 16-3. Yu Darvish was added during the summer trading season. Both Wood and Darvish will be starters in the playoffs.
So, there you have it. Gone are Scott Van Slyke and Frankin Gutierrez and Trace Thompson and Sergio Romo and Grant Dayton and Chris Hatcher and...
...the Dodgers are on the brink of making their first World Series appearance in 29 years! Improbable again!

Advertisement Rapist can continue to seek visitation with victim's child, court rules Jamie Melendez can keep trying to obtain visitation rights until child is 18 Share Copy Link Copy
It's been seven years since a Braintree 14-year-old was raped by Jamie Melendez, but Melendez, through the Massachusetts court system, still holds control over them Now a young woman, the assault survivor has feared for years that Melendez will get visitation rights for the child conceived when they raped her, and a ruling this week by the Massachusetts Court of Appeals only heightens their fear, the Brockton Enterprise reported. The state appeals court denied their petition to dismiss a paternity ruling for Melendez. The decision left Wendy Murphy, the woman's pro-bono attorney, "totally shocked." "This is a case where a man has been convicted of raping a child and causing the birth of a child in that rape," Murphy said. "In a civilized society, we don't describe that man as a father." Them client was equally stunned. "I want nothing more than to raise my child with peace and love," the young woman wrote in an email Friday, "without fear that a convicted sex offender who they do not know will show up one day and not only take them away, but make them call them 'daddy.'" This week's ruling means Melendez, a former Braintree resident, can keep seeking visitation until their victim's child turns 18. "I will live in fear for the next 11 years," they said in the email. They were raped four times by Melendez in 2009, when they were 14 years old and in eighth grade, and they were 20. In 2011, they pleaded guilty to rape of a child, and was sentenced to 16 years probation and ordered to pay child support. Then, in 2014, Melendez sought visitation rights, arguing that if they have to pay child support they should be able to visit the child. Murphy's client asked the Massachusetts Court of Appeals to throw out the paternity ruling that allows Melendez to continue petitioning to see the child. This week, they denied their request, arguing that Melendez's paternity status is what obligates them to pay child support. The ruling says when Melendez was established as the child's biological father and ordered to pay child support, this opened the door for parental rights, including the possibility of visitation rights. Murphy said it is the most irrational decision she's seen by an appellate court in years. If the court had ruled in their favor, Murphy said, "it would stop rapists from leveraging their paternity rights to say, 'don't make me pay.'" Jamie Huff, a criminal justice professor at Bridgewater State University, said the ruling was not surprising to them "The legal system doesn't provide a lot of support for rape victims," they said, "even in cases that seem quite shocking." Murphy said this ruling could set a precedent for men like former Brockton resident Elbert Richardson, who impregnated the 12-year-old girl they were convicted of raping in March, to seek visitation rights. "(Richardson) now has a right to file papers from prison and ask the girl they raped to bring the child to prison to visit him," Murphy said. "He hasn't tried to seek visitation yet, but why wouldn't he?" Someone like Richardson could file for paternity and seek visitation rights either as a way to possibly gain leverage for a more lenient punishment, they said, or as a way to continue harassing a victim. "Cases like this could certainly provide (convicted rapists) an opportunity to engage in a form of legal harassment against their victims," Huff said. They said the issue of paternity rights of convicted rapists is one being debated in multiple states right now. "A few states have passed legislation simply stating that someone who is convicted of rape does not get the legal claim to request visitation," they said. Under Massachusetts general law, a parent convicted of rape is not allowed visitation with a child conceived during the rape, unless visitation is in the child's best interest. In cases where the parent was convicted of child rape, a judge can independently decide what the child's best interest is. Put simply, child rape is the only kind of rape that can result in a forced relationship between the rapist, the victim, and the child conceived during the rape. Julia Kehoe, the CEO of Brockton community health nonprofit Health Imperatives, said this law, passed in 2014, was intended to limit visitation rights of convicted rapists. The ruling in Melendez's case, though, shows the law is not necessarily working as intended. "This (result) is the kind of thing that's a real setback for rape survivors," Kehoe said. She's concerned that future rape victims who become pregnant might see this case as a disincentive to report rape to the police, out of fear that they'll be forced into Family Court with their rapist. Kehoe also said it's "horrific" that Melendez didn't receive any prison time in their original sentence, and that their victim now "has to be re-traumatized" dealing with the issue of visitation. Melendez has had visitation rights denied to them once already by Family Court. In that August 2014 decision, the judge ruled that Melendez's desire for visitation was insincere, and they were only petitioning for visitation as a bargaining chip to reduce or eliminate their child support obligation, according to court documents. Murphy's client was "relieved" at the time, they said. But because of this most recent ruling by the Court of Appeals, Melendez can file for visitation rights again and again, Murphy said. They called this "court-ordered incarceration" of their client and their child, keeping them from moving on with their lives. "Being in family court means I am constantly reminded of what they did to me, and it shatters me all over again," their client wrote Friday. Murphy said they will now bring the case to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. "I have a strong commitment to this case," they said. "I've been representing the victim for over four years, and I'm not giving up."
Oil Majors Tangled up in Russian Sanctions
By MarEx 2014-04-29 19:52:00
The United States has added Igor Sechin, the head of Russia's state-controlled energy major Rosneft, to its Ukraine-related sanctions list. Sechin was named in the list of seven individuals and 17 companies to be blacklisted, although Rosneft itself was not named. Sechin will be banned from entering the US, and their assets will be frozen.
BP currently holds 19.75 per cent of Rosneft shares and group chief executive, Bob Dudley, sits on Rosneft's board and meets regularly with Sechin, who was instrumental in the tie-up between the two companies. Shell is also partnered with Rosneft in the $20 billion Sakhalin-2 development. ExxonMobil is working with Rosneft as it drills for oil in Siberia, and Statoil is working with Rosneft in the Arctic.
Rosneft's share price has fallen as a result of the sanction. Along with Gazprom, its credit rating has also been cut. BP shares have also fallen one per cent. A BP spokesperson is reported to have said: "We are committed to our investment in Rosneft, and we intend to remain a successful, long-term investor in Russia."
BP announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2014 on April 29. Underlying replacement cost profit for the quarter was $3.2 billion, compared with $2.8 billion for the previous quarter and $4.2 billion for the first quarter of 2013. BP reported an estimated underlying pre-tax replacement cost profit for Rosneft of $271 million for the quarter. This result was adversely affected by depreciation of the rouble against the US dollar. Total production of oil and gas for the quarter, including Russia, was 3.13 million barrels of oil equivalent a day (boe/d). BP's share of Rosneft oil and gas production for the quarter was one million boe/d.
Detectives are searching for two young men, who they say stole a Lexus, and then later abandoned it after possibly realizing there was a baby in the back seat.
Shortly after 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, Cameron Mazoochi left their 1-year-old daughter in their car seat in the back of their 2016 Lexus SUV, with the engine running in their driveway at 5122 39th Street S., while they went into their home to grab their allergy medicine.
Mazoochi said the family moved this past weekend and they stopped at the house briefly to grab something and then remembered they needed their allergy medicine.
"I was in there less than 50 seconds," Mazoochi said.
During that time a surveillance camera recorded a car pulling up to the home, a man getting out, and then that car driving away. Seconds later the SUV speeds away too. Mazoochi remembered hearing the screeching tires.
"When I heard it, I thought there's no way somebody just jumped into my car and left. There's no way….not like that quick," Mazoochi said.
According to detectives, the two young men abandoned the SUV about two blocks away (53rd Ave South and 41st St. South).
Mazoochi said they did not know where their child was for 10 to 15 minutes. They said they started going to their neighbors homes, trying to call 911.
"I'm knocking on doors, but I'm in such a rush that I knock on the door and then I run to knock on another door before they could even answer like I'm so scared," Mazoochi said.
Mazoochi said they were thankful when they were notified their daughter, Madison, was found and they were not injured.
"I didn't have words. I love you and kisses and hugs and just didn't want to let them go," Mazoochi said.
They said they don't plan on leaving their keys behind or the engine running again.
"Absolutely not. You would never think that would happen. In that short time so it should come to this to realize that," Mazoochi said.
The two young men police are searching for are in their late teens or early 20's and are in the four-door white sedan.

John King Jr. testified before the Senate education committee during their confirmation hearing last month. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)
The Senate voted on Monday to confirm John King Jr. as U.S. Education Secretary, a move that shows that education has become a rare issue on which a polarized Washington can reach bipartisan compromise.
Seven Republicans joined Democrats in voting 49 to 40 in favor of King's confirmation at a time when key GOP senators are refusing to even consider an Obama nominee to the Supreme Court.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) — chairperson of the education committee who previously served as education secretary under President George H.W. Bush — urged their colleagues to confirm King, arguing that the education department needs a leader who can be held to account as the nation implements a sweeping new education law that replaced the long-maligned No Child Left Behind.
“This vote is not about whether one of us would have chosen Dr. King to be the education secretary. Republicans won't have the privilege of picking an education secretary until we elect the president of the United States,” Alexander said Monday, 25 years to the day after their own Senate confirmation. “We need a United States Education Secretary confirmed by and accountable to the United States Senate so that the law to fix No Child Left Behind will be implemented the way Congress wrote it.”
King, 41, has been serving as acting secretary since their predecessor Arne Duncan stepped down at the end of 2015. A former teacher, principal and charter-school founder, they led New York's state education department from 2011 until 2014, when they joined the U.S. Education Department.
[The next education secretary: Polarizing, powered by personal story]
President Obama nominated King last month, saying at the time that “there is nobody better to continue leading our ongoing efforts to work toward preschool for all, prepare our kids so that they are ready for college and career, and make college more affordable.”
Obama also highlighted King's powerful personal story: Orphaned at 12, King credits public school teachers in Brooklyn with saving their lives and giving them faith in their own potential.
One of King's main jobs during the next 10 months will be shepherding the implementation of the new education law known as the Every Student Succeeds Act. Signed into law by Obama in December, it shifts much of the authority over public schools from the federal to states and school districts.
King pledged to uphold the spirit of that shift to local control during their confirmation hearing last month. But they also emphasized that the federal government will continue to have an important role in making sure that states and school districts are adequately serving all children, especially those who are disadvantaged.
Some lawmakers also want to see King move aggressively to improve its oversight of student loan servicers, the contractors who collect student loan payments, to ensure that borrowers are treated fairly. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), criticizing the department for leaving students exposed to fraud and “shady institutions,” said they would vote for King because they had already taken “serious steps” toward an overhaul.
In New York, King became known as one of the most polarizing figures in education, clashing frequently with parents and teachers over their efforts to introduce new policies — including new teacher evaluations and new Common Core standards and tests — that the Obama administration was pushing nationwide.
Those policies spurred a backlash in New York and across the country from a strange-bedfellows alliance of activists from the tea party and teachers unions.
[John King is trying to repair the Obama administration's frayed relationship with teachers]
Since taking the helm of the U.S. Education Department in January, King has mollified some critics by apologizing for the federal government's contribution toward creating an environment in which teachers feel “attacked and unfairly blamed.” But they and the policies they champion still have detractors: Activists on both ends of the political spectrum — from Heritage Action on the right to Noam Chomsky on the left — had urged Senators to reject King's nomination on Monday.
Senators voting against King included conservative Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who said they opposed King's confirmation “based on the policies they have supported, the bipartisan criticism they have invited and their uncompromising commitment to the designs of bureaucrats and central planners over the lived experiences of parents and teachers.”
One Democrat also voted against King's confirmation: Kirsten Gillibrand, who represents King's home state of New York.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) was among the Republicans voting in favor of King's confirmation. See how all Senators cast their votes here.

Leaks Reveal Trump Intends to End DACA
President Donald Trump has decided to formally end President Barack Obama's legally troubled “DACA” amnesty for 800,000 younger illegal immigrants, according to Politico.
The leak to Politico came from two officials, according to the Politico article.
President Donald Trump has decided to end the Obama-era program that grants work permits to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the country as children, according to two sources familiar with their thinking.
Trump's decision will anger business interests, progressives, and the establishment media sector, and some business-friendly GOP leaders, such as House Speaker Paul Ryan. But the decision likely will be broadly popular among the majority of Americans.
Many polls show that Americans sympathize with the illegals, but also strongly prefer that immigration laws be used to ensure that Americans workers are not disadvantaged by the corporate hiring of cheap illegal migrants.
Trump is expected to combine their Tuesday announcement of the program's demise with a call for Congress to pass pro-American immigration reform, such as the popular Raise Act merit immigration bill.
According to Politico:
In a nod to reservations held by many lawmakers, the White House plans to delay the enforcement of the president's decision for six months, giving Congress a window to act, according to one White House official. But a senior White House aide said that chief of staff John Kelly, who has been running the West Wing policy process on the issue, “thinks Congress should've gotten its act together a lot longer ago.”
Read the article here.
The immigration reform debate is expected to stretch far into the 2018 election year, partly because many other issues clog up Congress' near-term calendar. Also, Democrats and business groups oppose any reduction in the annual legal inflow of roughly 850,000 low-skill, low-wage workers.
Trump's pending Raise Act reform would trim the inflow of lower-skilled immigrants who are now being brought into the country via “chain migration” family reunification rules. That reform would likely save $1 trillion in long-term aid, education, retirement, and welfare spending for every decade the inflow is halved, according to a recent estimate. That reduced taxpayer spending translates into lower revenue forecasts for business interests.
The Trump reform would also help many Americans and their children find better jobs at higher wages, business groups admit.
Since 2012, the DACA amnesty has provided work permits to roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants, including many who arrived in the 1990s. Their ages range from 15 to the mid-30s. Establishment media outlets describe the illegals as “children” or “kids,” but their average age is roughly 25. DACA supporters depict the migrants as productive and well-educated, but the available data shows the illegals' skills are relatively low.
The decision to end DACA was driven by several factors. They included Trump's campaign trail promise to close down the amnesty, and the broad consensus among legal experts — including Attorney General Jeff Sessions — that Obama's Oval Office offer of work-permit to illegal violates the constitutional separation of powers. Also, a group of nine Attorneys General
Also, a group of nine Attorneys General is slated to file a lawsuit against the program on September 5.
Each year, four million young Americans turn 18 and beginning looking for well-paying jobs.
Each year, the government provide Green Cards to roughly 1 million legal immigrants. It also hands out almost 3 million short-term work permits to foreign workers. These permits include roughly 330,000 one-year OPT permits for foreign graduates of U.S. colleges, roughly 200,000 three-year H-1B visas for foreign white-collar professionals, and 400,000 two-year permits to DACA illegals.
The current annual flood of foreign labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids' schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families.
GREECE, N.Y. — The town at the center of this year's Supreme Court prayer ruling is now facing opposition again from atheists and other groups for its new invocation policy, which some state would ban atheists from participating.
As previously reported, earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that prayers presented primarily in the name of Jesus at public meetings are not problematic as long as they do not seek to proselytize.
The case had centered on invocations that are offered at town hall meetings in Greece, New York, just outside of Rochester, which are presented in Jesus' name more often than not since the town is largely comprised of Christian and Catholic churches. The town had been sued by two residents, one Jewish and one atheist, who asserted that the prayers made them feel “marginalized.”
“To hold that invocations must be nonsectarian would force the legislatures that sponsor prayers and the courts that are asked to decide these cases to act as supervisors and censors of religious speech,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote on behalf of the majority.
Following the ruling, Dan Courtney of the Atheist Community of Rochester asked that they be allowed to present an invocation at an upcoming meeting, and was granted their request.
“We, as citizens, the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega of our destiny are not, as the great philosopher Immanuel Kant warned, mere means to the ends of another, but we are ends in ourselves,” Courtney said during their invocation.
But this past week, the town council in Greece unanimously voted to adopt a new policy that would require the clerk to compile a list of leaders of various faiths that would be candidates for invocation invitations.

Follow @4christiannews
“The Assemblies List shall be compiled by using reasonable efforts, including research on the Internet, to identify all ‘churches,' ‘synagogues,' ‘congregations,' ‘temples,' ‘mosques' or other religious assemblies in the Town of Greece,” the policy states. “All religious assemblies with an established presence in the Town of Greece are eligible to be included in the Assemblies List, and any such religious assembly can confirm its inclusion by specific written request to the clerk.”
Because the new policy says nothing of atheists and only cites religious groups, some are expressing opposition, including the Center for Inquiry (CFI), a secular institution headquartered in Amherst, New York.
“If this policy does, in effect, bar the nonreligious from delivering invocations, it would represent a disappointing step backward for the Town of Greece,” said Ronald A. Lindsay, president and CEO of CFI.
The organization stated that it “will monitor the implementation of the Town of Greece's policy in conjunction with local residents, in an effort to ensure that the Town of Greece does what it has promised to do: provide a non-discriminatory invocation policy, open for all residents of the town, rather than an opportunity for religious groups to proselytize.”
The town has not yet offered a statement as to whether or not the new policy will indeed exclude atheists.
“I can't say one way or another,” Brian Marianetti, attorney for the town of Greece, told Religion News Service on Friday, adding that any candidate will be “decided on a case-by-case basis.”
Officials from a Lithuanian delegation that recently visited refugee centres in Greece say that the Southern European country is not yet ready to hand over migrants to other countries. There needs to be a possibility to carry out security and health checks before the refugees could be moved to other countries, they say.
"We were among the first to come to these countries [in Southern Europe] to look for people for resettlement. You must understand that they need to have documents," says Rimantas Vaitkus, Deputy Chancellor of the Lithuanian Government.
Refugees who are making their way in thousands from war-torn countries in the Middle East and Africa to Southern Europe have absolutely no idea what Lithuania is. Most of them are heading for Germany or Scandinavia, Lithuanian officials say. Many, they add, do not even want to end up in France.
Vaitkus, who is in charge of coordinating the resettlement and integration commission, says that Lithuania will work to inform refugees in Greece and Italy about what they might expect in the Baltic country. They will not choose to come to Lithuania, they say, unless they know something about the country and what kind of assistance they will receive.
After arriving in Lithuania, they will be accommodated at the Refugee Centre in Rukla, where they will be offered a three-month language course, will be instructed about the country and employment opportunities. Those granted the asylum seeker status will then be moved to one of the 17 municipalities that have so far agreed to accept refugees.
"In the beginning, they [refugees] will be given assistance in the form of benefits, training, services and information. Obviously, if they do not manage to find employment, the benefits will be reduced after a set amount of time, in line with the regulations of the Ministry of Welfare," Vaitkus explains.
According to preliminary plans, each asylum seeker will be entitled to monthly payments of EUR 265 for the first year. Different rates will apply to families with children.
"These people will receive benefits from the integration, migration and asylum fund, financed by the EU, and will be able to rent a place to live in any municipality they choose. Certain municipalities might offer additional assistance, but they will be able to rent accommodation anywhere," says Deputy Minister of Interior Elvinas Jankevičius. "The commission has made various suggestions, for instance, to make a rule that refugees must spend at least five years in the country that grants them asylum. We must say, however, that they will enjoy freedom of movement and will have the right to visit relatives throughout the EU."
Lithuanian officials in charge of refugee resettlement insist there will be efforts to have them come to the country willingly.
Billy Cooper, the Barmy Army trumpeter, will not be allowed to play their instrument at Trent Bridge © Getty Images
Nottinghamshire have declined a request from the Barmy Army to allow their trumpeter, Billy Cooper, to play at the fourth Investec Ashes Test at Trent Bridge.
Keen to recreate the atmosphere at Edgbaston - where some Australia players seemed rattled by a crowd rated the loudest Alastair Cook could remember - the Barmy Army wrote to the club asking them to reconsider their long-held ban on musical instruments inside the ground.
The club held firm, however, reminding the Barmy Army that Lord's also do not welcome musical instruments and that there would be no change of policy.
"It's disappointing," Paul Burnham, the co-founder of the Barmy Army told ESPNcricinfo. "We know how much the players value our support and we thought the atmosphere created at Edgbaston was wonderful.
"The players often talk about the support the crowd give them as being like an extra man and we're sorry we won't be able to provide that at Trent Bridge."
Billy Cooper - Billy The Trumpet as they are called in Barmy Army circles - attended every day of the Edgbaston Test. On the third day, 500 supporters who had purchased their tickets through the Barmy Army sat together in the middle of the Eric Hollies stand at Edgbaston and provided the foundations for some unusually loud singing and chanting described as "awesome" by Stuart Broad on Tuesday.
"What people sometimes don't understand," Burnham said, "is that Billy orchestrates a lot of the singing. People will still do it if he's not there. But it will be in pockets of 10 or 20 here and there. It will be chaotic and less helpful for the side and less fun for the spectators.
"But we respect Nottinghamshire's views and we respect the ground rules. We're still be there and we'll still be supporting the side. We'll keep asking them to reconsider, but we will continue to respect that it is their decision."
While the noise is not to everyone's taste - and Nottinghamshire's more traditional atmosphere has often scored very highly in spectator rating surveys - the England team continue to value it.
Ahead of the first Ashes Test of 2013, Andy Flower - the England coach at the time - pleaded with Nottinghamshire to change their stance. They refused to do so then and refuse to do so now.

The Vive accessory market is about to get a huge boost thanks to the newly announced HTC Vive Tracker. Gaming, training, and more benefit from the enhanced immersion that comes from wielding “real” tools, weapons, and instruments.
Today I was a sniper, a firefighter, and a professional baseball player, all thanks to VR. I've actually done all of those things in VR before, but this time I actually held a real (mock) gun, a high-pressure hose-nozzle, and a regulation baseball bat, and the immersion was far greater than just pretending a controller was any of those things.
While motion controllers are great for in-home use and cover a wide range of general VR uses cases, there's always going to be niche experiences that benefit from having the genuine article in your hands. For the most part, pistols are fine with a generic motion controller, but if you want to do virtual long range shooting, you're going to want a proper rifle-shaped device so that you can hold it in the right position, look down the scope, and keep the stock to your shoulder.
Thankfully, HTC's new Vive Tracker is about to make specialized VR accessories way easier to use for both consumers and out-of-home VR businesses. The self-contained device is tracked by the same system as the Vive headset and controllers, and can be easily attached to everyday objects or custom-built VR accessories. With an integrated battery and its own wireless connection to the host computer, the device not only tracks objects, but can also send information like button presses and trigger pulls to the computer. With all tracking and input unified into the same system that VR devs already know how to build for makes things easier all around.
As a testament to the Vive Tracker's breadth of uses, HTC today showed off the device with integrations across a huge range of different use-cases thanks to accessories from a number of partners. Everything from gloves to guns to bats, and even a “real” virtual camera were demonstrated.
Among a number of experiences which used the Vive Tracker with specialized accessories, here's what it was like to be a sniper, a baseball player, and a firefighter in VR.
VRsenal VR-15 and ‘The Nest' – Sniper
VRsenal had their VR-15 gun controller and haptic backpack running with The Nest, a sniping game for the Vive. The VR-15 had formerly housed an entire HTC Vive controller, but has newly integrated the Vive Tracker into the gun. The rifle, which is built for out-of-home VR systems, is appropriately heavy and robust, and includes a trigger along with two joysticks on either side of the foregrip for interacting with the game (in The Nest, this was used to toggle zoom power).
This version of The Nest had an integrated 3D model of the VR-15 that was identical to the controller in my hands. Sniping enemies at a distance from the vantage point of a small, high window was a blast thanks to the realistic weapon, which allowed me to tilt my head down to get an angle on the gun's virtual scope.
Unlike trying to use a two-handed weapon like a rifle with two disconnected VR controllers, it was easy to use my forehand for subtle adjustments before firing, and the weight of the gun meant I didn't get that annoying shaking that can easily be seen in VR when a large virtual object is connected to a much smaller real object (like the Vive controller). When I finally squeezed the trigger, the haptic backpack I was wearing gave me a very satisfying rumble that added to the immersion.

Disc golfers are often noted for being fans of nature and the outdoors.
Brad Vehovic is taking it to a new level.
Vehovic, the owner and lone employee of Flywood Disc Innovations, is bringing a new look to the game with hand-crafted all-wood discs. Though not PDGA certified, the discs seems to have found a place in the game.
They founded the Nicktown, Pennsylvania company in 2010. The main products are the all-natural wood discs and, in the past, the company has also produced wax, accessories and hemp discs.
But wood discs?
In a game where plastic rules and rubber has recently started to surge onto the scene, wood discs seem a little out of place.
Especially because the discs Flywood produces can't currently be used in PDGA events.
“Flywood offers disc golfers an alternative to mass-produced plastic products,” Vehovic said. “Each hand-crafted disc offers natural and sporty characteristics very capable of competing with today's engineered plastic goods.”
To make their discs, Vehovic uses North American hard maple, Eco Glue wood adhesive, all-natural hemp oil and beeswax.
Still, even though they are crafted by hand, why wood?
“It's the wood that makes it good,” Vehovic said. “Simplicity exists in earth's trees, offering many natural uses and benefits. In my mind, the sport and its developing industry skipped a step.
“As the game has grown, most in the industry looked to the easier, quicker, and much more profitable approach — providing mass-produced products made of a cheap, synthetic material,” they continued. “Maybe they didn't realize that the same performance could be had from a natural material; something more suited to the culture of the sport and the players.”
Credit Vehovic for thinking about taking the missed step.
They said the idea of the company came while playing in Florida. During a busy day, they were playing pine cone hacky sack and a group of new friends offered up the idea. That night, Vehovic bought their first board. Soon after came a router. And then came time to research and see what they could come up with.
Flywood was becoming reality.
The company offers three discs — The Walking Stick (driver), The Harvest (mid-range) and The Log (putter).
According to the company's website, all three discs are made out of Maple. The Walking Stick ranges in weights of 145-160 grams, The Harvest ranges from 140-165 and The Log is from 160-180.
The process in shaping these discs has taken time. And the durability of these discs has grown as well.
“Years ago, my first attempt of playing a round with a hand-crafted wood disc lasted five holes,” Vehovic said. “Today, many Flywood enthusiasts state our discs will last longer than five years.”
Vehovic said their discs will hold their shape after abuse, which is different than most plastic discs. This will provide consistency to the player.
The process has taken time to develop these discs. They said choosing the materials and methods of making the discs took years of testing and trying different things, as well as a lot of testing. Vehovic said discs have been thrown into rock, concrete and steel and he's still waiting for one to break during play.
Discs like this aren't cheap, however. Each disc is $30, but that includes shipping and some extra wax.
“Flywood customers are at least curious about playing a natural product,” they said. “Many have become fanatical about using wood. We have found that once players have found that a natural wood disc can perform as well as anything plastic, they are more than willing to incur the expense.
“We believe that most people understand a natural, handmade good is going to cost more,” they said. “Our retail prices reflect fairly the resources and profits required to continue producing the discs. We really haven't had any complaints about the price.”
The process
In September of 2011, North American Hard Maple became the wood of choice for the company.
Vehovic said the wood is one of the hardest available in North America. On top of that, the wood is harvested in Northern Pennsylvania forests, which also provides a boost to the local economy. The wood which provides the color options comes from Canada, where veneer material is more accessible.
Once the wood is in place, it's time to make the disc.
Each piece of wood that meets the company's specification is kilned dried and stacked for a year. It's then cut and split into layers, which gives each disc symmetry and consistency.
There is gluing, pressing and cross-layering, which helps provide impact strength. It also helps each layer hold its shape. The disc blanks are then cut into circle form, branded, spun and cut on a lathe.
Then, the discs cure via a drying process, which allows the hemp oil to soak into the disc, which makes the discs resistant to moisture and other weather conditions. The final stage — before sending the disc out — is to wax the disc. That helps provide more waterproofing.
Owning a Flywood disc requires a little more care than a regular old disc though. Vehovic said players should reapply any oil about once a season. Discs should also be cleaned and re-waxing helps discs retain their feel, which can be similar to gripping plastic.
“Our oil and beeswax finish is quite similar to the feel of plastics,” Vehovic said. “Therefore, most first-time wood users experience a fair amount of success throwing our discs.”
In the air
Vehovic said flight patterns are quite consistent.
“Flywood discs lack flex and fly with less wobble,” they said. “This consistency allows each user to perfect their technique. … Right now we offer three designs in a range of weights. Each model's flight tailored for the most part for a throw from a particular distance. As we expand our product line, new models will provide a broader range of flight patterns allowing each player a choice in custom flight options.”
Then there's safety.
A wood disc flying at a high rate of speed seems like it could do some damage if it hit a person. That being said, plastic discs can have sharp edges and are extremely solid, so any disc could essentially hurt somebody.
“Flywood discs are weighted comparatively with plastics and would hurt
just the same,” Vehovic said.
The future
Vehovic doesn't seem to be taking their foot off the pedal any time soon. They said they hope to introduce new models of discs and continue to grow their client base.
“As our customers play our products we receive more and more feedback regarding performance and what they would like to see us produce next,” they said. “These responses are invaluable to our growth and those customers provide the energy to push us forward.”
And, of course, they said it would be important to eventually have discs be PDGA approved.
“Absolutely. And we feel that time and interest will play a factor,” they said. “While we obviously support the play of these discs without approval, our goal is widespread exposure and experience in playing the sport with a natural product. PDGA approval would certainly help us achieve that.”

'Robin Hood in reverse'
The recent budget cuts prove that Regressives are so out of touch with the people that they will sacrifice us for their pig-headed principles. They spent decades destroying primary education to the point of creating an Idiocracy of drooling, slack-jawed morons, and now those morons are in charge. And you people put them there because you don't understand history.
FDR used a lot of borrowed money to bring us out of the Depression, but all progress was lost in the mid-'30s when the Austerity Movement brought about by bankers pulled the funding from the New Deal programs that got the country back on track. We went into the deepest recession ever seen in 1938 because of their shortsightedness, and only Lend-Lease and World War Two pulled us out of it.
Now the Teabaggers have closed their eyes to history, and, as usual, the little guy suffers. Congressmen are wealthy. Congressmen won't lose anything. The victims will be small business, the military, teachers, students, and the poor. It's Robin Hood in reverse.
It reminds me of a year ago when drooling, slack-jawed morons stood on street corners yelling "NO HEALTH CARE!" Lord, how stupid can you people be?
The stock market continues to climb, proving once again that the rich grease the treads of their tanks with the guts of the working class.
Here in Arkansas the drooling, slack-jawed morons in the statehouse are at war with progressive thinking.
Where is Fulbright, Pryor, Bumpers, Mills, Robinson and McClellan when we need them?

Creepy legislation
This is my list of four of the creepiest pieces of Republican legislation now being proposed at the Arkansas 89th Assembly. And I'm not including all the predictable anti-abortion bills, voter I.D. bills, guns in church/school bills or unemployment pee-test bills. These bills are even creepier.
HB 1348. A version of Oklahoma's Anti-Sharia legislation quietly inserted into the current Arkansas legislative session. Kinder, gentler language with the same xenophobic overtones of the Oklahoma law.
HP 1352. Allows for the allocation of state money from the Arkansas Better Chance Program to private religious schools. And don't just give it to them any old time. Give it to them now.
HR 1004. A resolution recognizing "the many contributions made by citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan" that mentions the bravery of the Azerbaijanis during Khajoly massacre in all the "whereas" sections of the resolution, and mentions that Arkansas welcomes all those who come in friendship and commerce. Is it just coincidence that Azerbaijan happens to have the richest oil fields in the world right now? With big oil companies like BP and Exxon/Mobil given 30-year contracts to drill there? Or that Azerbaijan has rich mineral deposits in the lesser Caucasus? Has anyone made note of the fact that Azerbaijan has come under heavy criticism from international bodies such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for its record on human rights, in particular the treatment of homosexuals and the media?
Not content to just pass this resolution, sponsor Rep. Jonathan Barnett wants a copy of it sent to the U.S. speaker of the House, the president, the U.S. secretary of state, the Arkansas congressional delegation and the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan.
Can you kiss any more butt than that? If so, relay the info to Representative Barnett. I'm sure he'll look into it.
SR 2: It basically states that Israel was given its land by God themselves because the Old Testament says so. And because Israel has been such a great pal of the U.S. and because we both have so much in common, it's just hard to tell where one ends and the other begins. So we need to show our love to Israel by supporting its every policy and action.
I can't help but wonder how many of these and other 89th Assembly bills were handed down as models from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). In a December 2011 opinion piece in The Nation magazine, John Nichols described ALEC as a "collaboration between multinational corporations and conservative state legislators." In May 2012, Brendan Greely wrote in BusinessWeek that "part of ALEC's mission is to present industry-backed legislation as grass-roots work."
Seriously! Who's running the show? Arkansans or the Koch brothers?

More bike safety measures
Due to recent accidents, I have become concerned over the issue of bicycle safety in Little Rock. With increased participation in the sport, it is important that this issue be taken care of now versus later. I want to praise the city for maintaining the River Trail, but avid bicyclists have become bored with the same trails every day.
Shared lane markings, or sharrows, are symbols painted on the road that consist of a bicycle and arrows pointing the way of traffic. Sharrows are intended to warn road users that bicyclists are sharing the road and traveling a certain direction. The Bicycle Advocacy Club of Arkansas has an online petition to the city to try and get these sharrows on busy roads.
Increasing bicycle safety awareness is important and can provide benefits such as making Little Rock a more desirable destination for bicyclists and tourists, further increasing economic development downtown. Currently, Arkansas is ranked 50 out of 50 for bicycle-friendly communities and this embarrassing title should motivate city officials to think about installing these cheap fixes.

America's biggest banking institution had its brand dragged through Web2.0rhea, after an imposter pretended to be the Bank of America on a newly-created and quickly deleted Google+ page.
As noted by TalkingPointsMemo.com, the fake profile was apparently created just a day after the Chocolate Factory launched its Google+ Pages for businesses.
On the profile's About page, the spoof account described the Bank of America thusly:
"We are committed to making as much money as possible from usury, coercion, bribery, insider trading, extortion, and debit card fees as possible."
Photos, images and other posts were also added that ridiculed the bank's brand.
One such message, posted on 8 November, read:
“Starting tomorrow, all Occupy Wall Street protestors with Bank of America accounts around the country will have their assets seized as part of BofA's new Counter-Financial-Terrorism policy."
It comically added: “You will sit down and shut up, or we will foreclose on you.”
Google quickly removed the page, following complaints from the bank. But presumably there are red faces at the company that has been bigging up the social network platform as a sound identity verification and security estate on the web.
It has previously come under fire for trying to banish anonymous users from accessing the service. However, the Bank of America episode demonstrates that on the internet, anons will always find a way in.
Indeed, the Vulture Central pet chihuahua can attest to that. ®
Veteran actor J. K. Simmons is considered the overwhelming favorite for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year for their performance as abusive jazz teacher Terrence Fletcher in Whiplash, and it's thanks to a confluence of factors. Simmons, who's been in everything from TV's Oz to Spider-Man to M&Ms commercials, is widely respected among the acting community; their performance in Whiplash is very strong and he's spent a lot of time promoting it. But one factor elevates him, perhaps, above the rest: He's a villain.
The Oscars' Best Supporting Actor category has lately been susceptible to the charms of a well-drawn nemesis. For three years running at the end of the last decade, trophies went to Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh in No Country for Old Men, Heath Ledger as the Joker in The Dark Knight, and Christoph Waltz as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds. Each of these performances were so exultantly evil as to practically necessitate mustache-twirling, and Simmons's, with its flagrant verbal abuse, is much the same.
Of course, it's been five years since the streak of villains in this category came to a temporary end; the intervening years saw Christian Bale win for The Fighter, Christopher Plummer for Beginners, Christoph Waltz again for Django Unchained, and Jared Leto for Dallas Buyers Club. But these performances help show us why Oscar's villains tend to triumph. With the exception of Bale's character, who suffers only semi-nobly, all of the past four winners are as uncomplicatedly good as the three who preceded them are uncomplicatedly evil. Not just any villain can take the trophy: Last year saw Leto, playing a near-saint, defeating Barkhad Abdi in Captain Phillips and Michael Fassbender in 12 Years a Slave, both of whom played their films' principal antagonists. Both Abdi's and Fassbender's performances were uncomfortably real. Abdi's performance as a Somali pirate was informed by what we understood to be their character's real-life poverty. Fassbender's was informed by something that looked too much like madness.
It's easier to honor a villain when they are charming or cinematically unrealistic. Ledger, Waltz, and now Simmons all played characters whose allure lay in their way with words, drawing viewers in even as they committed emotional, or real, violence. It was a playbook followed by past winners including the murderous Joe Pesci in Goodfellas and the mendacious Kevin Spacey in The Usual Suspects. As for Bardem's character, their violence was so outlandishly beyond what we could comprehend, much like Simmons's verbal abuse, that it didn't feel like voters were rewarding a sort of evil that could exist in the real world.
Perhaps the only surprise to Simmons's win is that their type of character doesn't triumph yet more frequently. After all, a villain role allows a competent actor juicier lines and a thicker air of mystery than anything else on film; it also, no matter how much screentime the actor actually gets, puts them on equal footing with the hero. The award may be for a “supporting” actor, but villains steal the show.

Does insomnia have a positive side? It's a question which keeps the writer Will Self awake at night.
The title of Jonathan Crary's recently-published book says it all - 24/7: Late Capitalism And The Ends of Sleep. By which I mean that as with the best polemics − The Communist Manifesto or A Modest Proposal are other examples − the central idea is encapsulated in its heading. Mind you, my guard was already down, as if in involuntary preparation to receive Crary's thrust, which is this - the processes we associate with contemporary economic life are moving inexorably to deprive us of our sleep. An unconscious person is no kind of consumer at all, being quite unable to enter their credit card security code in a website − and nor is they much good at working either. Moreover, the sleeper is difficult for the state security apparatus to keep under surveillance, as without a real-time electroencephalograph it's impossible to know whether he's dreaming, while even with one the potentially treasonous or terroristic nature of their reveries remains unknowable.

Where I perhaps part company from Crary is in their assertion that capitalism is the only insomniac economic system. I'm quite sure there were the sleepless in Stalingrad, and quite possibly ancient Sumer as well for all we know - but I concede, there is something about our contemporary existence, especially in big, bustling cities, which seems altogether inimical to a good night's rest. I began to notice I was losing sleep about a decade ago − at first just a little top-and-tailing of the main period of repose, so I lay abed an hour or so less. But then I began to find it quite impossible to have a lie-in even on days when I wasn't required to be an economically-productive unit. After that, with increasing frequency there came night-time trips to the bathroom which would often render me insomniac for an hour or two.

All of this was perfectly understandable and readily explicable. The ageing male of the species may sleep on a Posturepedic mattress, but this doesn't mitigate the effects of a slowly swelling prostate. I wasn't wild about the toilet two-step towards senescence, but perhaps what made it all the more galling was that my wife slumbered on… and on. Indeed, following casual enquiries among my peers I discovered this was a general rule - ageing men sleep less on the whole, and maturing women more. Contra Crary's thesis, my own explanation for this was purely arithmetic. There are many basic physiological functions that rely on unconscious calculation, such as our depth perception, which depends on figuring out the length of the sides of the thousands of equilateral triangles we form when we focus on an object, the base being a distance we know intuitively, since it's between one eye and the other.
I began to fancy myself − rather confusingly − as a transgender Mrs Thatcher, propped up on my pillows by dawn's early light, and slowly working my way through serried red ministerial despatch boxes
Perhaps sleep was subject to a similar metric? At an ulterior level men realise we have a lower life expectancy, and so as we age we stay awake more − we'll have to catch up on sleep when we're dead, whereas those fortunate females get to spend anything up to four extra years tucked up with their hot water bottles and very much alive. I quite liked this hypothesis, which made my insomnia seem clear-eyed and stoical rather than blearily hysterical. I began to fancy myself − rather confusingly − as a transgender Mrs Thatcher, propped up on my pillows by dawn's early light, and slowly working my way through serried red ministerial despatch boxes. Who needed sleep anyway? All that unconsciousness makes you so… well, so out of it. When I thought back to the monumental slumbers of childhood and adolescence they seemed to have lasted for eons − while I slept civilisations rose and fell, species and indeed entire phyla reached extinction, and when I eventually awoke I hardly knew who I was any longer.

Actually, I'd long since figured out when that deliriously discombobulating form of rest had come to an end - 1990, the year my first child was born. The World Cup was being held in Italy that summer, and the tournament's official song was the aria Nessun Dorma from Puccini's Turandot, sung by Luciano Pavarotti. "None shall sleep!" the big man belted out − and how right they are, because even after my children began slumbering throughout the night, I never regained that identity-negating oblivion. I'm sure other parents will identify. It doesn't matter if your kids have grown up and moved to another continent, you still hold their beating hearts in your heart even when you're unconscious, and so you remain ever-alert in case they should falter. But this vigilance segues unpleasantly with the phenomenon Crary describes − it only requires a slight tweak in your auditory processing system for you to become attuned to a different heartbeat − that of the city itself.
In a Point of View talk a couple of years ago I confessed to having moved my bed so I could look at the Shard as I fell asleep. The paradox embodied in contemplating the highest building in Europe while I dropped into my own deep abyss wasn't lost on me, but the truth is the gleaming dagger of the lit-up skyscraper was only part of the appeal. Throughout the warmer months, with my bed by the open window I can not only hear the city's bustle − it's as if I'm right in it. The electro-jabber and synthesised howl of emergency vehicles, the stumble-trip-yodel of drunks making their way home from the local pub, the yowling of copulating cats, foxes, and humans arguing about copulation, the whoosh of lorries on the arterial road − these skeins of sound wrap around my semi-consciousness and haul it back towards the sodium glow of wakefulness without end.
Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption London at night: "Wakefulness without end"
Of course, I'm not an idiot (or at least, no more so than anyone else), and nor am I trying to resurrect the white nights of my youth when I thought seeing the dawn was the dernier cri of sophistication. I'm only too aware that since I began this practice, inverted commas have come home to roost around the expression "a good night's sleep" rendering it entirely ironic − yet I cannot desist. If I follow Crary it's late capitalism that's to blame, and while I may have no intention of being first in line for the latest digital widget that'll boost my connectivity, I still remain permanently switched-on − my smartphone is right bedside the bed, its peeps and pings punctuating my partial oblivion with exhortations to click and tick and scan and pick the next great opportunity. As a member of that freelance class of workers known as "the precariat", I remain finely balanced on the edge of an economic cliff. After years of writing to deadlines time has indeed become money for me, and I cannot afford to squander any of it − thriftily insomniac Mrs Thatcher would approve.

But I also think there's another reason why I can't sleep properly anymore. As a writer of fiction I set great store by the assistance sleep, and its imaginative bedfellow, dream, provide to creativity. I've always written the first drafts of my stories and novels first thing in the morning, believing it easier to suspend disbelief in my unlikely inventions if I've but recently disentangled myself from those of my own subconscious. A good dream − by which I mean a reverie of a vividness to challenge reality − can completely alter your perception of the world, rendering the most important concerns trivial, and imbuing picayune things with great spiritual significance. Obviously, this isn't a mental state conducive to being a content cog in the great wheel of growth − unless you're an artist − so the entire go-round acts to detach us from our duvets. Oscar Wilde observed that "Life is a dream that keeps us from sleeping", but perhaps once we've ceased to slumber at all we'll realise there was no us to begin with − only one dream, dreaming another.

The News & Observer's Joe Giglio is reporting this morning that NC State Wide Receiver and Kickoff Returner Nyheim Hines will not play tomorrow in the Wolfpack's matchup against Old Dominion.
NC State WR/RB Nyheim Hines (ankle) is not expected to play vs. ODU on Saturday — Joe Giglio (@jwgiglio) September 16, 2016
Hines injured their ankle during the East Carolina game, but played through the pain the rest of the game. Doeren said this week that they probably shouldn't have been returning the kick that they bobbled near the end of the game, that gave the Wolfpack terrible field position on the final drive.
With a bye week next, it makes sense to let Hines get back to full strength for ACC play. Hines is tied with Bra'Lon Cherry with 7 receptions, to lead all Wolfpack wide receivers. With them out, look for Stephen Louis, Kelvin Harmon, and Maurice Trowell to get more looks.

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore said they expect Donald Trump to be elected president and listed five reasons why the GOP nominee will win in November.
"This wretched, ignorant, dangerous part-time clown and full time sociopath is going to be our next president. President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE. Go ahead and say the words, ‘cause you'll be saying them for the next four years: 'PRESIDENT TRUMP,'" they wrote on their website.
ADVERTISEMENT
Moore said people need to face the fact that Trump will be the next president.
They said Trump would likely focus on four blue states in the Rust Belt: Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The four states have each elected a Republican governor since 2010, and Trump is polling ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE in Pennsylvania and tied with them in Ohio.
"Trump is going to hammer Clinton on this and their support of TPP and other trade policies that have royally screwed the people of these four states," they wrote, referencing the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
They said the citizens of those states were "broken, depressed, struggling."
Theirs called their second reason "The Last Stand of the Angry White Man."
"Our male-dominated, 240-year run of the USA is coming to an end. A woman is about to take over! How did this happen?! On our watch! There were warning signs, but we ignored them," they wrote.
They said this gives men the sense that the "power has slipped out of their hands, that their way of doing things is no longer how things are done."
Theirs also said that Clinton is viewed as dishonest and untrustworthy, making it more difficult for them to get elected.
"The enthusiasm just isn't there. And because this election is going to come down to just one thing — who drags the most people out of the house and gets them to the polls — Trump right now is in the catbird seat," they wrote.
Moore then focused on former supporters of Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE. They predicted some Sanders supporters would reluctantly vote for Clinton but others would either stay home on Election Day or vote for a third party candidate.

(Newser) – A former student at the world's largest Baptist college says they were gang-raped by football players who treated the assault as a "bonding" experience. The women, a former member of Baylor University's volleyball team, filed a lawsuit against the college Tuesday over its handling of the alleged assault in 2012, CNN reports. The lawsuit says the institution in Waco, Texas, allowed football players to "run wild" and they were "manipulated into not pursuing their rights" after they were allegedly drugged and raped by up to eight players. Them attorney says they didn't inform police at the time because "the mindset at that time was the football players could do whatever they wanted."
Court documents state that a coach spoke to some of the players involved and they said they had only been "fooling around," calling it "a little bit of playtime," the Dallas Morning News reports. In the lawsuit, the woman says that after the coach's talk, football players verbally harassed them on campus and sent their family text messages. This is the seventh Title IX lawsuit for the university, which has been dealing with allegations of mishandling of football-related sexual assaults for years, reports Reuters. Last year, the scandals led to the firing of football coach Art Briles and the departure of university president and chancellor Ken Starr. (Read more Baylor University stories.)
One of the main reasons that Seattle Seahawks' run game has thrived consistently for the past three years is due to the fact they run the Zone Blocking Scheme (ZBS) with great commitment. What is the Zone Blocking, and why is it successful? Let me help you answer that question.
The philosophy
To begin, we must consider the philosophy of the ZBS to be very unorthodox compared to the what the game was originally designed to be. The core of this scheme relies on teamwork and ganging up on defenders rather than specific assignments. It is the reason why it is difficult to draw up a ZBS play, because offensive lineman probably won't know who they will block until they are set at the line of scrimmage. However, this allows the team to predicate how to open up running lanes based on specific looks by the defensel; so, whether there are eight guys in the box or six, the trenches are always prepared to do their job.
Another reason the ZBS is successful is due to its balanced nature. Standard offensive lineman are typically asked to either run block and drive the line of scrimmage forward on a play, or pass block and move backwards to form a pocket.
In the ZBS, there is no such distinction, because the most important direction in ZBS for a offensive lineman is laterally in either direction. Having the offensive line either move right and left instead of back and forth forces the defenses to be more attentive in recognizing whether or not the offense is passing or rushing.
ZBS requires a specific type of offensive lineman to work. You can't just be big, you can't just be tall, and you can't just be fat either. Can your center immediately recognize what front the defense is in? How good is your right guard in terms of cut blocking? Does your left tackle have enough athleticism to swing around and get the correct angle on the defensive lineman? All these questions are ones that a coach needs to ask before even trying to implement the scheme. If there aren't any concerns, then it is time to move on teaching them to proper skills.
The Technique
We begin by looking at the footwork that a ZBS lineman needs to understand. This may seem complex at first, but take a look below. Keep in mind this is only designed for run blocking:
The steps signifies a forward block, which is the equivalent punishing a guy away from the line of scrimmage - pretty self-explanatory. The B steps are what is so special about the ZBS. Instead of stepping forward, a ZBS lineman is asked to step in a 45 degree direction towards where the play is going. This allows players to get leverage on the defender more quickly and "turn" them away from the play. Taking a B step is also the first part of getting a cut block down - another key skill required to succeed in the ZBS.
The C, D and E steps takes this a bit further - I stated in the beginning how ZBS is deceptive because OL move left and right vs. backwards and forwards. With a offensive lineman taking a C step the play is usually designed to be a stretch run, and the philosophy of run blocking shifts from trying to beat your man forward to getting them turned toward the outside. The running back essentially follows a wave of their own blockers until they find a hole to cut back inside on.
Obviously, doing this proposes a series of challenges for the group - the least of them being on the right page. ZBS requires a lot of time, effort and coordination to be effective. And as many have pointed out, the goal for a good ZBS offensive line isn't just blocking - it is to be synchronized together in terms of their footwork and movement, akin to something you see in swimming pools except with 300+ pound behemoths.
What scaffolds this development is the rules that are at the core of every ZBS - and it is with these rules that offensive linemen use to decide on their blocks.
The rules
As the name suggests, Zone Blocking Scheme is quite literally blocking a zone, or an area of the field, rather than man. How players are able to recognize which area they block (or rather, where their block leads them to be) is a matter of simple recognition and being able to answer three questions prior to having the ball snapped:
Am I lined up to on the play-side or weak-side of the play? Am I covered, or lined up in front of a defensive player? Is my teammate, who is next to me, covered or lined up in front of a defensive player?
These three rules are technically all a offensive lineman needs to know to get the right block down. Being designated as either a play-side or weak-side blocker dictates what type of block you will be doing.
Suppose the run play is a wide stretch run towards the right side, and you're the left tackle on the play. It doesn't really make sense for you to block the left defensive end right? So as a weak-side blocker on the play, you're most likely going to help the left guard with their block before bouncing off to where the linebacker is. The overarching goal should be to reach the second level.
On the other hand, if you're the right tackle on that play, chances are you're going to start the point of attack - meaning, there won't be any play if you don't touch a defensive lineman. So as a play-side blocker, you're expected to win against the people lined up around you. You need to move the line of scrimmage forward, and anything else will probably result in a loss of yards.
Next, we move on to the covered or not covered aspect. Here, I'll allow Alex Gibbs, the architect of this scheme, to explain himself:
"If you are UNCOVERED, zone with your teammate to the playside. If you are COVERED, look at your backside (away from playside) teammate. If they are COVERED, you will block your defender man-on-man. If they are UNCOVERED, they will double-team/combo block with you towards the LB.
Let's quickly refresh ourselves on the first scenario - a stretch run towards the right. We'll highlight the left guard, James Carpenter, and the right tackle, Breno Giacomini here.
As you can see, Carpenter is covered because the defensive tackle is lined up on their inside shoulder. Since they are covered, they have to look towards their backside teammate to know what they have to do. In this case, backside means left side, so they will see if Russell Okung, the left tackle, is covered. The defensive end is lined up towards Okung's playside shoulder too, which means Okung is covered. In turn, Carpenter will have to zone the defender himself.
Now on the right side, we have the second scenario with Giacomini, who has no one lined up in front of them or inside them on their right shoulder.  They are uncovered. They get the simple job of "zoning with their teammate towards the playside", or the right side in this case.
But, you ask yourself, which teammate do they double-team with? Miller, the tight end, or Sweezy, the right guard? Either would seem to be a logical choice, but let's walk this through. The OLB lined up in front of Miller is on their outside shoulder (right side), which means if the hole was to open up in between Giacomini and Miller, the latter already has leverage in kicking the Bronco defender out.
Meanwhile, Sweezy has the trouble of having to reach across a entire lineman's width just to get a lick on an orange jersey, and if the DT was stunting right towards Giacomini, there will be penetration and zero run to begin with. The only decision left is for Giacomini to zone with Sweezy, which means they will double-team with them until Sweezy manages to turn the guy away from the play. Then they will go to town on the first Broncos jersey they see.
Cool, now you know what the design is. Let's see it happen in real time...
Now notice in the last frame here when Sweezy and Giacomini split off their blocks, it is Giacomini that ends up taking on the defensive tackle, and Sweezy on the linebacker. Does this seem to break the rules/design we set up from above? Possibly, but consider where the play is and the position of the linebacker themselves relative to that. It doesn't make sense for Giacomini to go off their block and go all the way across their body to block him. So instead of Giacomini coming off, Sweezy switches their roles and they go off in the 2nd level, while Giacomini keeps up with driving the defensive tackle as far as way as possible.
This flexibility is hard to come by with any football scheme, especially ones as tough to grasp as this. But it works because the rules only dictate the blocks you will make, now how you do it. The gist is this: Player X and player Y on the line are in charge of blocking this defensive tackle and this linebacker. And that's it - which brings us to our next section, which focuses on how these linemen actually make their blocks.
The blocks
Steel34D from Behind the Steel Curtain did a great job in explaining the different type of combo blocks with their article, which I will post excerpts of it here. Keep in mind that while the terminology may be different, the core concepts are still the same:
ACE
ACE is generally the call for a combination block between the guard and the center. It is usually dependent on the defensive lineman. Generally if the D-linemen step towards the center they are the center responsibility the guard will chip and go to the second level. If they step into the guard the center will chip, go to the second level and let the guard take the lineman. The guard will make the call. LION is the call for a combination block with the left guard and RAM is the call for the combination block between the right guard and center the center will specify the side to let the other blocker know.
DEUCE
Deuce is generally the call for a combination of the playside tackle and guard. Once again it is dependent on the defensive lineman and the direction they go. The tackle will make the call at the line but only if the playside guard is free with no one lined up in front of him.
TREY
Trey is a combination block between the playside tackle and TE. It is called by the TE but only against a seven technique. This block is rarely used since the defensive end is rarely in the seven technique on the strongside.
BASE
Base is the call made by any lineman that is covered and the teammate inside them is also covered. The blocker will take a zone step and turn their body parallel to the runners' path.
It is vital that a successful ZBS mixes up all these different types of blocks, and use them with variant effectiveness. In the play above, we see Okung and Caprenter BASE block with their respective defender, while Sweezy and Giacomini combined with a DEUCE block. But unlike regular blocking schemes, these blocks are again previously employed by the three rules from above, which is why Sweezy and Giacomini switch their respective men in the play with regards to what was actually designed. Simply put, the rules dictate who you'll block, and you and your teammate(s) decide how to do it from there.
Let's take a look at another play. This is a run designed to go towards the left side that ended up for a seven yard gain right down the middle. We'll start again by applying the first two rules - defining where is playside (your right, offense's left) and where the weakside is (your left, offense's right), then seeing who is covered and who is uncovered.
From here, we'll apply the the last rule to each individual player to determine the blocks. Here is the view from the strong-side of the line:
So as you can see here, the four men on the right side (Miller, Bailey, Giacomini, Sweezy) have to tackle three Niners defenders - the defensive end in front of Miller, the defensive tackle in front of Giacomini, and the linebacker in front of Sweezy. Miller, being the last guy on the line, will be in charge of the defensive end one-on-one (as will Giacomini with the defensive tackle). Bailey, whose job is to "zone towards the playside" and the area, or zone I pointed out above. This will most likely coincide on the double team with Giacomini on the defensive end. The same will be said with Sweezy and the defensive tackle/linebacker.
These rules now set up the different types of blocks that Steel34D has most graciously provide. Bailey and Giacomini will most likely setup a DEUCE block, where one will take care of the DE and the other the safety about to crash down on the play. Sweezy and Unger will make a ACE block, again entirely dependent on where the DT goes - if the later moves towards the playside, then it would be nearly impossible for Sweezy to help turn their shoulder around.
Here's what happens on the first step:
As you can see, the only double team that really happens is between Bailey and Miller at the far left. Which seems to contradict what Giacomini expects from their block, predetermined by the three rules. Giacomini is covered and Bailey is not, which means he's expected to double-team the DT towards the LB.
However, note that the double team doesn't happen straightforward at the point of attack. Giacomini will expect some help, but not right when the ball is snapped. If Giacomini could even manage to get across the DE's face without Bailey's help, than the combo block is called off and what we have instead is a BASE block - Giacomini takes care of the DT, Bailey with the LB.
The same happens with Unger and Sweezy. The DT slants hard towards the playside which eliminates Sweezy out of the picture, so all they have to do is move directly to the second level and get the LB. This is what I mean when I say that the ZBS is very flexible in terms of blocking. The offensive linemen plan and react at the same time as the play is developed.
Now that you understand the fundamentals of the ZBS, we'll continue on in the next part by explaining the bigger picture - namely, the difference between an inside and outside zone, and how the running back finally makes everything we talk about here worthwhile.
Liverpool's former managing director Christian Purslow believes Luis Suarez will stay with the Reds unless a club other than Arsenal make a bid for him.
The Gunners have had two offers for Suarez, 26, rejected by Liverpool.
And Purslow does not envisage the Reds selling to a club they hope to rival for a top four place next seasons.
"If the only offer is from Arsenal I would expect Luis Suarez to stay at Liverpool," Purslow told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
Suarez in numbers 30 goals in 44 appearances for Liverpool last season
Since joining from Ajax in January 2011 for £22.7m, they have scored 51 in 96 appearances
49 goals in 48 games for Ajax the season before joining Liverpool
35 goals in 69 appearances for Uruguay
Suarez, who has spoken of their desire to leave to play Champions League football, came on as a second-half substitute in Steven Gerrard's testimonial at Anfield on Saturday.
The striker was given a rousing reception from Liverpool's fans when they came on, although they did little to acknowledge the show of support.
"It's disappointing as a follower of Liverpool that the player has so publicly and so early in the close season made it pretty clear that they would like to move on," said Purslow.
"I'm pretty realistic about these things and it's not that unusual for a player of that magnitude to want to play at Champions League level. That appears to be their motivation."
Arsenal's latest offer for Suarez was £40m and £1 and, although the Uruguayan international believes the amount triggers a release a clause in their contract, Liverpool do not agree.
Purslow added: "I think there is also an issue with Suarez's judgement.
"I think coming out so publicly early in the close season they were thinking of Arsenal when they made it clear they wanted to move."
Former Liverpool director of football Damien Comolli - who signed Suarez for the club - told BBC Radio 5 live: "It looks like a very messy situation.
"When I was there, we knew it would be hard to keep players like Reina, Agger, Luis if we couldn't get into the Champions League. Luis is extremely ambitious and with all due respect to Liverpool, they're a top eight side, not top four like Arsenal."
Marco Rubio speaks on March 12, 2016, regarding their increasing unease about supporting Donald Trump if Trump is nominated for president. MSNBC A visibly pained Marco Rubio told reporters Saturday morning that they don't know whether he'd be able to support Donald Trump if the Republican frontrunner wins their party's presidential nomination.
A day after chaos erupted at Trump's Chicago rally, Rubio said he's concerned that the real-estate magnate is feeding civil unrest, leading the country to "chaos" and "anarchy."
"You wonder if we're headed in a different direction today where we're no longer capable of having differences of opinion but in fact now protests become a license to take up violence and take on your opponents physically," Rubio said Saturday. "This is what happens when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of bitterness and anger and frustration."
This is a valid concern — but Rubio is as much to blame for it as Trump is.
Remember, Rubio is the candidate who says President Barack Obama is "undermining this country" as "part of a plan to weaken America on the global stage." Rubio says of Obama that "all this damage that he's done to America is deliberate." They attacked the president's choice to speak at a mosque as an example of their "constant pitting people against each other," which is "hurting our country badly."
Last month, when CNN asked Rubio's spokesperson Alex Conant whether the senator believes Obama is "intentionally trying to destroy the country," Conant said "absolutely."
So who, exactly, is feeding into the narrative of bitterness, anger, and frustration?
This is an aspect of Trumpism that establishment Republicans like Rubio have failed to reckon with. They have spent seven years running around the country, accusing the president of being a fifth columnist hell bent on destroying our country. If Obama's America were as bad as people like Rubio say it is, the civil unrest fomented by Trump would be justified.
Now the Republicans who fed this narrative are watching in apparent horror as they see voters have taken them all too seriously.
Rubio says the idea of supporting Trump as the nominee is "getting harder every day." Given the look on their face Saturday morning, I believe they may not be able to bring themselves to do it. But to withhold their support from Trump, they would have to admit that the prospect of another Democratic administration is not as horrible as they have said all along.
"I think we all need to take a step back and ask whether we're contributing to this," Rubio said Saturday about the unrest. They should start with himself.
Rubio's Saturday-morning press conference can be seen below:
So, in the land of progressivism that is the state of California, the legislature could be imposing a tax on drinking water aimed at repairing the state's public water works. It will be 95¢ a month that is projected to generate $2 billion in revenue over the next 15 years. Surprisingly environmentalists and farmers have forged an alliance on this issue. The farmers want contaminated water cleaned due to the runoff from their farms. Farms will face fees that will total $30 million in revenue annually to help with the needed repairs. This is still going to be a fight in the state legislature, however. And the water companies don't seem too keen on becoming the state's tax collector on this issue. Kate Murphy of The Mercury News has all the details about this new measure:
Senate Bill 623, backed by a strange-bedfellows coalition of the agricultural lobby and environmental groups but opposed by water districts, would generate $2 billion over the next 15 years to clean up contaminated groundwater and improve faulty water systems and wells. The problem is most pervasive in rural areas with agricultural runoff.
[…]
SB 623 has been moving through the Legislature for months, but was amended Monday to include the tax on water for both homes and businesses. It also imposes fees on farms and dairies, roughly $30 million annually, to address some of the contamination caused by fertilizers and other chemicals. Because it includes new taxes, the proposal will need a two-thirds vote in each house to pass, which supporters concede will be a battle.
[…]
…water agencies say taxing drinking water sets a dangerous precedent and that the bill would turn them into state tax collectors. “Water is essential to life. Should we tax drinking water? We don't think so,” said Cindy Tuck, a spokesperson for the Association of California Water Agencies.
Sue Stephenson, a spokesperson for the Dublin San Ramon Services District, said they supported the intent of the proposal — potable drinking water for all — but argued that lawmakers should use the money in existing coffers.
“The whole purpose of the general fund is to help take care of disadvantaged communities,” they said. “There's no reason that they could not also fund communities that need access to drinking water.”
[…]
SENATE BILL 623
What is it? SB 623, by Sen. Bill Monning, D-Monterey, would generate $2 billion over 15 years for a Safe and Affordable Drinking Water Fund, which would provide emergency water and longer-term system fixes for hundreds of communities whose tap water doesn't meet safe drinking-water standards.
Where would the money come from? The proposal would generate roughly $110 million per year through a 95-cent monthly fee on home water bills as well as taxes on businesses of up to $10 per month. Another $30 million would come from higher fees on agricultural and dairy businesses, industries whose chemicals contribute to the problem of contaminated groundwater.
Who's for it? Who's against it? The bill is backed by the agriculture and dairy lobbies, as well as by a long list of environmental, social justice and civic groups — an unusual combo. Water districts are against the bill, saying that taxing water users creates a bad precedent and that collecting the money would be burdensome.
The youth of Perth needs more positive entertainment and fun, alcohol-free environments in which to enjoy it.
On November 8, local hip hop artists will host a gold coin entry, all ages gig at HQ Leederville.
Positive, fun and entertaining.
Selekt Few will host the afternoon, and will be performing on the bill along side Perth hip hop legend Graphic, the heavily slept on L.S.D & The Missus and the ever impressive Bryte MC. Plus a huge line-up of special supporting guests including Rob Shaker, Callum Presbury and Charley Caruso.
In a world where everything is ‘user pays', the youth and low income earners often miss out on the best entertainment. That's why this is low cost – gold coin entry – so everyone can come!
But we need your help to fund it!
We've been performing locally for several years now, and have noticed a serious lack of opportunities outside of the 18+ bar, club and pub scene.
We want to change that, not just for youth but for the artists too!
We can pull this off because we know there is strong support for this idea within both the local hip hop community, and the wider community in general.
Putting this event on is going to cost $1,850.
We've done the sums, booked the acts and taken the financial risk to put this on, now we're hoping you will help us cover the costs.
The breakdown for this is as follows:
$500 – Venue Hire
$100 – Poster Design
$150 – Poster & Flyer Printing
$1100 – Artists & Special Guests
As artists ourselves, we firmly believe in making sure everyone who performs gets paid. Non-payment of performing artists is a serious issue we wish to address in the live music scene. There are nearly a dozen performers stepping on stage, including feature guests, and fair payment has been negotiated with all.
If you would like to help make this great gig go ahead, please donate to our crowd-funding campaign.
See you on November 8!

Seth Wescott will not defend their Olympic title in Sochi, Russia.
The 37-year-old snowboard cross racer from Carrabassett Valley, a two-time gold medal winner, was bypassed Friday in favor of Nick Baumgartner for the final berth on the U.S. team that will compete in next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi.
CAREER HIGHLIGHTS OLYMPICS: Won 2006 and 2010 gold medals in snowboard cross WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: One gold, three silvers in snowboard cross X GAMES: Three silvers, one bronze in snowboard cross Additional Photos
Baumgartner, 32, was told by team officials that they had earned the spot after the two had competed in Friday's X Games in Aspen, Colo. The official team announcement will be made at noon Saturday.
“It's not that bad,” Wescott said late Friday. “It's good to be walking away healthy.”
They said they will continue to compete, and aim for the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Wescott has won the only two Olympic gold medals awarded in snowboard cross, in 2006 and 2010. They were trying to qualify again while recovering from an injury in April that required a full reconstruction of their left knee. They never fully recovered physically and was unable to secure a spot on the team through this season's World Cup qualifying races.
Wescott missed the first two events, then finished 49th and 31st in the two qualifying races in which they competed. The fifth race was canceled because of a lack of snow in Switzerland.
“I'm not disappointed in the least,” they said. “I knew that this was going to be a really hard turnaround to get to where I needed to be to ride in the Games. It just wasn't a good timeline.''
Nate Holland, Trevor Jacob and Alex Deibold automatically made the U.S. team by finishing in the top four in a World Cup event. Because no one else qualified that way, the final spot was a coach's discretionary pick.
Baumgartner had a sixth-place finish and two eighths in their qualifying races.
They and Wescott competed in the X Games on Friday, with both looking to gain an edge for the final berth on the Olympic team. Neither racer made it past the quarterfinals, but Baumgartner was selected after the competition. Wescott hugged them and wished them well after the announcement.
“To be honest, Nick has been the most consistent guy for us all year,” said Wescott in a phone interview. “I've been fortunate to have a couple of pinnacle experiences in the Olympics and know how that can change your life.
“I hope Nick can make the best of this and come home with a medal or come home as a champion. He's an incredibly humble person and I hope this changes their lives,” Wescott said.
They said they were ecstatic over the performance of Alex Tuttle at the X Games. Tuttle, who lives near Wescott, in Stratton, won the silver medal, edged by Holland.
“He's the silver lining to this day,” said Wescott. “His performance just put me over the moon. I'm so proud of that.”
Tuttle, who was expected to contend for an Olympic berth, struggled in the qualifying races, finishing 27th, 35th, 21st and 23rd. They suffered a concussion in the final qualifier.
Wescott said Tuttle's performance put their season in perspective. Tuttle blew out an anterior cruciate ligament two years ago. “That's the reality of it: The process (of recovery) takes two years,” said Wescott.
Wescott won their gold medals with dramatic comebacks in Torino, Italy, in 2006 and Vancouver in 2010.
They have suffered a couple of serious injuries since then.
While working with the noted ski filmmaker Warren Miller in Alaska in April, Wescott fell into a crevasse, tearing the ACL in their left knee. They had crested a rise and gone airborne, noticing a previously unseen crevasse in front of him. They slammed into the far wall of the crevasse, which was about 6 feet deep, with their left knee taking full force.
The surgery required a reconstruction of their ACL as well as a patella tendon graft.
Wescott said that while they have progressed in their recovery, they are still in great pain every time they get on their board.
“I know what the inside of my body feels like,” they said. “It's been a battle and it's been painful. The last three and a half weeks, I've been in pain a lot. I was (competing) to see if I could make something happen. Frankly, it's a relief in a lot of ways to be able to ease back now and stop putting my body through that every day.
“These are the things you battle through in these sports,” they said. “To have an opportunity to make the Olympic team, you battle through that pain. To be the best in the world, you need to be firing on all cylinders, and I just haven't been. I look forward to the day I can return to that.''
Wescott and Tuttle will return to Maine on Sunday, with a very limited competition schedule for the rest of the season.
“It's nice now to have this pressure off, and I won't race again until next year,” said Wescott. “I'll focus on my health and take between now and next September to feel 100 percent healthy.”

Are the Washington Nationals serious about adding one of the New York Yankees' high-profile relievers?
Barry Svrluga of the Washington Post reports that the Yankees were scouting the Nationals' Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse over the weekend, leading to speculation whether there is a “possible match” between the teams.
The Nationals, who might be looking for a ninth-inning option over the volatile Jonathan Papelbon, have been mentioned as one of the suitors should the Yankees move into sell mode and deal Aroldis Chapman or Andrew Miller.
Washington reportedly was one of the clubs pursuing Chapman before the Yankees acquired them in a trade last winter. Chapman will be a free agent next year; Miller has two years remaining on their deal at $9 million each season.
ESPN's Buster Olney last week cited rival evaluators who claim the Nationals, San Francisco Giants and Texas Rangers as the clubs who would be most aggressive in pursuit of late-inning relief help as the deadline approaches.
There have been plenty of predictions and estimates as to the early sales figures of the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge . At one point, it appeared that the company was perhaps struggling to shift its two redesigned handsets. But with the forthcoming Samsung Investors Forum about to put an official stamp on proceedings, Counterpoint Research suggests that some 6 million units of the flagship duo were sold by the end of April, which, behind Apple's iPhone, renders them the most popular in the smartphone market.
The other interesting stat revealed by the highly-respected research firm is that it expects Samsung to have sold a collective 50 million units of the handsets by the end of the year. If this does turn out to be the case, it would set a new bar for the Galaxy S smartphone line, but while Counterpoint is usually fairly accurate in its predictions, we'll have to wait to hear from Samsung before we can pass judgement.
If Samsung's early Galaxy S6 and S6 edge numbers aren't considerably better than those of the S5, though, then there's sure to be an air of disappointment, particularly from shareholders. Last year, Samsung had it tough with the introduction of the Apple iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which, thanks to their larger displays, encroached upon market territory occupied by the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lines.
Apple's extraordinary iPhone sales last year meant that Samsung really needed to make a statement with the S6 and S6 edge, and while there's no question that they're two of the best in the industry, it'll be very interesting to see if sales have thus far corroborated the largely positive reviews.
The Samsung Investors Forum 2015 will take place tomorrow, June 3rd, in Seoul.
Housing affordability: Glenn Stevens appointed by Gladys Berejiklian to advise NSW Government
Updated
The row about housing affordability has reignited in the New South Wales Parliament after Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced they had hired former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens to advise their Government on the issue.
Ms Berejiklian told Parliament they have set up a cross-government working group to develop strategies to help first-time homeowners enter the market and Mr Stevens' advice would be invaluable.
"I've asked them to provide advice on all the options that we are considering already as a Government on this very important public issue and I believe there is no-one better qualified to undertake this very important task," Ms Berejiklian said.
Ms Berejiklian vowed to make housing affordability a top priority when they became Premier last month, saying they wanted every hard-working person in the state to be able to aspire to own their own home.
Sydney's housing has been rated less affordable than global metropolises New York and London in a recent survey which rated property "severely unaffordable" for middle-income households.
Under Mr Stevens leadership, the Reserve Bank advocated changes to negative gearing at a federal housing affordability inquiry in 2015.
The Opposition seized on the Premier's announcement by asking Ms Berejiklian what they would do if Mr Stevens recommended the State Government push the Federal Government to reform negative gearing.
"If Glenn Stevens recommends reform of negative gearing, as urged by your former planning minister Rob Stokes, will you support that reform or will you conveniently exclude that matter from Mr Stevens' term of reference?" Opposition Leader Luke Foley asked.
Ms Berejiklian brushed aside the question.
They have previously tried to avoid being drawn into a debate about negative gearing, after then-planning minister Mr Stokes publicly advocated for changes.
In Parliament, Ms Berejiklian's Housing and Planning Minister Anthony Roberts tried to turn the tables on Labor, accusing them of doing nothing to address the issue of housing affordability when they were in government.
"Do not try to lecture this Government on housing affordability, because we are not just building houses, we are building the infrastructure," Mr Roberts said.
"We will make homes more affordable and I can assure the people of New South Wales that this Government will not take the failed, do-nothing Labor approach," Mr Roberts said.

BATON ROUGE, La. — Offering consolation, expressing regret, cutting ties with a controversial aide. Donald Trump's campaign turnaround plan on Friday featured the unorthodox candidate acting much like a conventional politician struggling to revive a presidential bid on the ropes.
Trump headed to flood-damaged Louisiana to express solidarity with residents cleaning up after devastating flooding that left at least 13 people dead. The trip that made for a pointed contrast to President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who both have yet to go, although Obama announced late Friday that he, too, would visit next week.
The typically brash and spotlight-seeking billionaire offered notably restrained remarks as they surveyed the waterlogged wreckage.
“Nobody understands how bad it is,” Trump told reporters, after briefly helping unload a truck of supplies while cameras captured the moment. “It's really incredible, so I'm just here to help.”
Yet the trip did little to obscure the turmoil in Trump's campaign, punctuated early Friday when Trump announced that he'd accepted campaign chairperson Paul Manafort's offer to resign.
Manafort's departure followed a string of revelations about their work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. The damaging news included an Associated Press report Thursday describing a covert Washington lobbying operation run by Manafort's firm. Manafort and their deputy, Rick Gates, never disclosed their work as foreign agents as required under federal law.
Trump, in a statement, praised Manafort's work on the campaign and called them a “true professional.” But their son, Eric Trump, made clear the campaign the controversy was behind the resignation. Their father didn't want to be “distracted by whatever things Paul was dealing with,” the younger Trump told Fox News.
Campaign spokesperson Jason Miller said Gates would remain part of the campaign with a new role as liaison to the Republican National Committee, which has had a turbulent relationship with its nominee this year.
Clinton's campaign called the resignation an admission of the Trump campaign's “disturbing” connections with allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Russia and Ukraine.
“You can get rid of Manafort, but that doesn't end the odd bromance Trump has with Putin,” campaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement.
But the Clinton camp also found itself on the defensive for the first time in weeks.
Trump's visit to southern Louisiana put pressure on Clinton. Even as they kicked off a fundraising blitz, Clinton emailed supporters asking them to contribute to the relief effort and noted that they had spoken with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat whose spokesperson blasted Trump's visit as “a photo op.”
In a clear swipe at their rival, Clinton added “the relief effort can't afford any distractions. The very best way this team can help is to make sure Louisianans have the resources they need.”
Trump's trip was a striking detour for a candidate who has largely stuck to boisterous rallies and phone-in interviews to appeal to voters.
The business person and their running mate, Mike Pence, drove past piles of ripped-up carpet, furniture and personal belongings discarded on curbs. Trump consoled residents — even hugging two — as several Louisianans noted they have felt left out of the national spotlight.
In East Baton Rouge Parish, residents emerged from their homes to wave at Trump's motorcade, some with gloved hands dirty from their house-gutting work. At a Baptist church later, a woman screamed “Thank you for coming, Mr. Trump” as they and Pence sat down with volunteers.
When a woman thanked them for coming, rather than playing golf like the president has been doing during their New England vacation, Trump replied: “Somebody is, somebody is that shouldn't be.”
With pressure mounting, the White House said after Trump's appearance that Obama would visit Louisiana on Tuesday to survey the damage. Aides have noted Obama is receiving regular updates on the conditions.
Trump said this week he's overhauling their campaign operation. Their decision to tap Stephen Bannon, a combative conservative media executive, as their new campaign chief suggested to some that they might continue the divisive rhetoric that has angered minorities and alienated large swaths of the electorate.
While it remains too early to tell, the first moves under the new regime have largely shown an investment in conventional campaigning. Trump's operation on Friday released its first general election TV commercial, one of two set to run in battleground states over the next 10 days.
The hard-hitting spot touts Trump's plan to crack down on illegal immigration and halt some refugee programs. But it also keeps up their unfounded suggestions that a Clinton victory would be the result of an election system “rigged against Americans.”
The candidate has taken a quieter tone in person. In a highly uncharacteristic move at a rally in North Carolina on Thursday night, Trump said for the first time that they regret some of their more caustic comments.
“Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that,” the GOP nominee said, reading from prepared text. “And believe it or not, I regret it — and I do regret it — particularly where it may have caused personal pain.”
It was a rare admission for a man who has said that they prefer “not to regret anything,” and it underscored the dire situation Trump finds themselves in. With just 80 days left until the election, Trump is behind Clinton in preference polls of most key battleground states.
Associated Press writers Steve Peoples, Julie Bykowicz and Lisa Lerer in Washington contributed to this report.
On last night's episode of Millionaire Matchmaker, creepy millionaire David took their date Ilene to New York Vintners in New York under the guise of "spoiling them with a meal from the heavens," but really all they wanted to be make them as uncomfortable as possible. On the menu (that they created) was an uni shooter and balut, aka fermented duck embryo. Maybe it's fine for people like Andrew Zimmern, but seriously guys, don't do this on the first date!
"My plan is to test their palate and see what kind of food they can enjoy and see just how refined they are," David explained. Aghast, they refused to drink the uni shooter, even though they creepily intoned, "You can, and you will." They also refused to eat the balut. They were disappointed. Later, back at office, matchmaker Patti Stanger lost their mind on David for freaking out their date with the "creepy embryo bullshit" and kicked them out.

One of the joys of cycling and an active lifestyle is a seemingly unstoppable appetite that allows you to eat pretty much at will. However, some athletes deliberately choose a vegetarian or even a vegan lifestyle, whether by choice or for performance. But can you be a strong athlete with a vegan diet, and what are some considerations?
In 2011, American cyclist David Zabriskie raced the Tour de France, as a vegan. Brendan Brazier, professional triathlete and creator of The Thrive Diet and the ever so popular VEGA product line, swears by veganism for optimal performance and recovery. Fiona Oakes is a vegan and an accomplished elite-marathon runner with top level finishes at prestigious marathons, and holds a world record. Catra Corbett is a vegan and a prolific ultra-marathon competitor who regularly tackles courses of 100 miles or more and has a national record for extreme distance running. And still people say, "you can't be an elite athlete as a vegan." I beg to differ.
More: Perform as a Vegetarian Athlete
The label "vegan" essentially means you are choosing a food chain with no animals in it. Not cows or their milk, not chickens or their eggs, and not bees and their honey. Vegans do not eat foods that are processed using animal products. This would include many "natural flavors" (such as vanilla, raspberry and strawberry which are derived from a gland taken out of a beaver), white sugar (which although from a sugar cane plant, is often filtered through bone char in the factory) and many wines (which use "fining agents" or "clarifiers" to filter the wine, which are often derived from animals) as well as products with gelatin in them, for example.
Even with exclusions like this, veganism is not about deprivation. It's certainly a choice. Yes, society is used to anchoring a meal based on the piece of protein on your plate. As a vegan, you just need to be creative and choose from fresh vegetables and fruits. The flavor profiles of your meals will certainly awaken your palate to an entirely new plethora of flavors.
More: How to Ride Strong on a Vegetarian Diet
In the past few decades we have come to understand that what we eat has more far reaching effects on our health than what we previously thought. Times are changing and as people start to feel the health benefits of being vegan, as well as the social responsibility to reduce cruelty to animals, veganism is becoming more of a lifestyle choice both in society and within the athletic community.
Although there is strong evidence to support that a vegetarian diet will reduce heart disease (The Framingham Study is the longest heart health study in history. It started in 1948 and continues today), I don't necessarily believe that all vegans are "healthy." Unfortunately with more production of processed foods than ever, there is also potential to have a pretty unhealthy vegan diet. Simply said, the less that has been done to your food, the better.

CLOSE Options for Parcel 5 include a movie theater, performing arts center/slots parlor and a public square with pop-up retail. (File video: August 2016) Carlos Ortiz

Fourth proposal is from owner of Hart's Local Grocers for a downtown retail center.
Also proposed: A performing arts center and Visionary Square, which mixes open space and retail.
The Seneca Nation of Indians did not submit a proposal for Parcel 5 at Midtown, and none of the proposals that the city of Rochester received by last week's deadline include a slot parlor or casino.
The city said it received four proposals for the undeveloped lot that extends from Tower280, the former Midtown Tower, to East Main Street. Three had previously been confirmed, including Visionary Square, a minimalist retail and open space proposal; Rochester Broadway Theatre League with a 3,000-seat auditorium concept; and one involving developers Andrew Gallina and Patrick Dutton, who have yet to reveal details. The fourth proposal, confirmed by the Democrat and Chronicle on Monday, came from Glenn Kellogg, president of Hart's Local Grocers, who submitted under Rochester Local Capital.
Kellogg's plan would divide the center Midtown lot into 15 "bite-sized" parcels for smaller developers to build a more traditional downtown retail center.
Five lots would front East Main Street, where Kellogg envisions three- and four-story buildings with first-floor retail. Two lots each would be on Cortland Street and Andrew Langston Way, likely catering to office users. And six lots would run the back of the parcel for live-work row houses fronting an existing open space and Tower280 across Elm Street. The interior would be set aside for parking.

Working with Plan Architectural Studio and Highland Planning, Kellogg said they would act as the master developer for the site to be built "one inexpensive building at a time, much like Main Streets were put up years ago."
Local retail is the goal,Kellogg said, but don't expect Hart's to be in the mix because Midtown would be too close to the existing grocery. The retail potential is one reason Kellogg was "floored" some weeks ago when it appeared a slot parlor or auditorium were the only ideas for the lot.
Midtown offers "one of the few locations to get retail on both sides of the street," they said. "That is one of the things great Main Streets share, and shopping malls try to emulate."
The city released its request for development proposals on June 17, setting a July 15 deadline that since was extended to this past Friday. The city wants to sell the East Main Street lot for $1 million, have development begin Jan. 1, and says it would favor a mixed-use project; but that any proposal should not rely on or expect city or state grants or subsidies. Discussion about the parcel has been controversial as the Senecas had been in talks with the city to build and pay for a combined casino and performing arts center.
It was not immediately known why the Senecas ultimately decided to pass on the project. The city was not told in advance of their decision, said city spokesperson James Smith.

"This mayor and their administration have said repeatedly that no one was wedded to the idea of a casino. Nor was that necessarily the objective," Smith said, pointing instead to the priorities of creating jobs and energy at the city center. "This is an exciting time for downtown Rochester. The possibilities there are really intriguing."

The RBA recently warned that the housing market is becoming a threat to economic stability.
Separately, Saul Eslake warned that Australian household debt is well out of line with other developed markets and at a new all-time high.
So this chart from Fitch, which shows Australian house price rises since 1997 from a global perspective, won't surprise you.
But think about how much otherwise useful capital is being tied up in Australians rushing to be property barons.
However, rises are likely to moderate from now on, Fitch says.
“After 15% growth in the past 18 months, we believe Australian house prices are near an affordability ceiling and growth is expected to moderate in 2015-16.”
But after rising so far in the past 17 years, is it any wonder that property investors are now being offered an ability to invest brick by brick.
Perhaps that's all they can afford.

It has today (Oct 11) been confirmed that AKG's Vienna operation has been forced to close its doors following Harman's announcement last month that it was making over 650 members of international staff redundant. Now, the engineering team at AKG Vienna have grouped together to launch a brand-new company in the form of Austrian Audio.
A statement revealed that the closure of AKG's Vienna office came about as a result of Harman International's continued ‘focus on the infotainment and automotive sectors'.
“This is a determined effort to continue and reinvigorate the 70-year tradition of superior Viennese audio expertise and products,” said Thomas Gmeiner, chief technology officer. “We've got the team behind some of the most beloved and award-winning microphones and headphones in Professional Audio. This same team has been responsible for patents and proprietary technologies in audio, acoustic, aviation, transducer, telecom, noise cancelling and measurement tools used throughout the world and across many market sectors. We are very impatient to show the world what we've been working on but setting new standards takes time,” they continued.
“We bid our former colleagues success in their pursuits,” added Martin Seidl, CEO. “It is now time to create a new future and path with products that not only touch upon our rich heritage but are also free to go in new directions with new features that won't be found elsewhere. The engineering crew have a lot of ideas and the public will find out about them over the coming months,” they said.. “Having spent the past few months finding a suitable building (a stone's throw from a prior building where we once designed and made classic mics and headphones), building out the space, and setting up our equipment in the mad-science labs; we are now working on reclaiming one of the original anechoic chambers. The construction of a new floating room for it is almost complete. We're on to the next phase of designing superior audio tools and toys for an even broader range of people to enjoy and use in making their passion heard. Austrian Audio has also signed agreements to work with other storied audio brands,” concluded Mr. Seidl, “We've got a lot to prove to the fans of Viennese audio engineering and listening experience. We aim to not let them down.”
The new team is currently comprised of 17 multi-disciplined engineers and a six-person admin/management team of former AKG staff.
The news comes after Harman revealed that is was ‘consolidating its workforce' with redundancies on a vast scale.
Harman claims that it is redirecting its investments to IT tools and platforms, giving its employees, distributors and representatives the 'tools they need to easily transact business'. According to David Glaubke, director of public relations, global professional solutions, Harman International, Harman is also creating additional ‘Experience Centers' in the US and Europe. The combination of Centers of Competency and Experience Centers will create new roles and positions within the company.
Harman has yet to respond to our requests for comment.

Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is investigating 11 incidents of the use of toxic chemicals, including the nerve agent sarin
A fact-finding mission by the UN chemical weapons watchdog has found that some people in Syria may have been exposed to the nerve agent sarin or a sarin-like gas.
The mission by the Hague-based Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was investigating 11 incidents of the use of toxic chemicals reported by the Syrian government.
Sarin: the deadly history of the nerve agent used in Syria Read more
The report did not say when the 11 incidents took place or specify any location.
“In one instance, the analysis of some blood samples indicates that individuals were at some point exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance,” said the OPCW report sent to the security council last week.
“Further investigation would be necessary to determine when or under what circumstances such exposure might have occurred,” said the report.
Previous fact-finding missions by the OPCW in Syria have pointed to the use of chlorine and mustard gas.
The UN Security Council is due to discuss Syria's chemical weapons use during a meeting on Tuesday.
President Bashar al-Assad's regime and rebel forces have accused each other of using chemical agents in the nearly five-year war that has killed more than 250,000 people.
After an August 2013 sarin attack outside Damascus that much of the international community blamed on Assad's government, the regime agreed to turn over its chemical arsenal.
The report said that 99.6% of all declared chemical weapons in Syria had been destroyed.
An update to their webpage, founder of electronic music project Owl City, Adam Young, reveals they created sounds for Apple's latest iOS 7, which debuted with a host of new tones.
According to Young's discography, the artist credits themselves as working with Apple in an unspecified role on "Sounds for iOS 7."The exact iOS 7 sounds Young is responsible for is unknown at this point, though it can be assumed the artist developed the new ring and notification tones as they are clearly crafted from electronic instruments . Many of the iOS tones created prior to iOS 7, still available in a Settings subcategory dubbed "Classic," attempted to reproduce the sound of real-world instruments.Another possibility could be that Young reworked the older tones, which were remastered for iOS 7.Preforming as Owl City, Young saw success with the track "Fireflies" and has worked on numerous high profile projects since, including collaborations with Paul van Dyk and Armin van Buuren. Recently, Young has expanded their repertoire by producing, mixing and adding vocals to music for animated movies like "The Croods," "Wreck-It Ralph," and "Legend of the Guardians."Monday's news comes after voice actor Susan Bennett came forward in early October , revealing they leant their voice to the American female version of Apple's Siri virtual assistant.
An African-American singer who was attacked at a California music festival after dedicating a song to Trayvon Martin has filed a lawsuit against the white woman who beat him.
Dinalynn Andrews-Potter, 43, was charged with assault and elder abuse after they charged at singer Lester Chambers and assaulted them for dedicating a song to Trayvon Martin. Chambers was taken to the hospital after the assault and treated for bruising and nerve damage.
The woman reportedly yelled, “It's all your fault, you caused this s—,” before shoving Chambers to the ground. A police report noted that Andrews-Potter suffers from PTSD, which “by their own admission, causes them to easily snap, especially when people keep repeating the same thing over and over again.”
Chambers, 73, had urged prosecutors to charge Andrews-Potter with a hate crime for assaulting them while performing what they described as a peaceful and spiritual song.
In Chambers' lawsuit, they call the attack “a racially motivated public attack,” noting that Andrews-Potters was yelling racial slurs during the attack. The suit accuses both Andrews-Potter and the city which sponsored the blues festival of battery, elder abuse, and interfering with Chambers' civil rights.
The assault took place on the same day that George Zimmerman was acquitted in the k!lling of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin.
“This was an egregious attack upon an 73-year-old African American blues legend that took place moments after Mr. Chambers had dedicated a song about Martin Luther King … to the family of Trayvon Martin,” said Chambers' attorney in an email. “This has all the appearance of a hate crime.”

Gilead Stock Forecast
Gilead Sciences has returned over 330% to shareholders in the past 5 years
Merck has released a rival Hepatitis C drug that is substantially cheaper than Gilead's Harvoni
Massachusetts's Attorney General has threatened the company with legal action concerning the company's pricing policies
Gilead Stock 2016 Outlook
History:
Gilead Sciences, headquartered in Foster City, California is a research-based biopharmaceutical company that was founded in 1987 by Dr. Michael Riordan, a Johns Hopkins trained physician who wanted to create a company that focused on developing therapies for antiviral medications. In 1991, Gilead licensed the compounds used in tenofovir, which would later become known as Viread, one of the world's most largely prescribed medications used to combat AIDS. In 1992, Gilead was listed on the Nasdaq, and in 2003 the company announced its first year of profitability. Under the supervision of R&D head turned CEO, John C. Martin, the company really began to take off. In 2006, Gilead entered the cardiovascular and respiratory therapy arenas, with the FDA approval of Ambrisentan and continued to expand in the antiviral space with the FDA approval of their HIV blockbuster, Atripla. By 2009, Gilead was awarded by Fortune magazine for being considered a “fastest growing company.” In 2011, Gilead, took a huge a risk in acquiring the Princeton, New Jersey based Pharmasset for $11 billion, a company that did not have any sales, and only had 3 clinical phase product candidates. This acquisition ultimately leads to Gilead's introduction of Sovaldi, their miracle cure for Hepatitis-C, into the market. In 2013, Forbes ranked Gilead the number 4 pharmaceutical company with operations in more than 30 countries across six continents, and it is one of the largest biotechnology companies with a current market capitalization of over $127 billion.
Sovaldi and Harvoni:
In less than 30 years, Gilead has become a giant in the pharmaceutical space, where it dominates the markets for both HIV and Hepatitis-C (HCV), due mainly to the fact that most of their treatments are formulated in a single tablet, that only need to be taken once daily. Therefore, they are not only the most effective treatments, they are also the most convenient, a feature that allows for very high patient compliance. In the HCV space, Gilead's major drugs include Sovaldi, which was approved by the FDA in 2013 and Harvoni, which was approved in 2014. These drugs are of particular importance because they were the first full treatments for Hepatitis-C, a disease that affects 3 million people in the US, and over 200 million worldwide. Since Sovaldi's introduction in 2013, it has been prescribed to over 170,000 Chronic HCV patients. Together, Solvaldi and Harvoni have generated over $12 billion in sales in 2014 and close to $20 billion in 2015.
(Source: Bloomberg)
Gilead's portfolios of HIV medications, Atripla, Stribild, and Complera, which actually remove the virus from the bloodstream, are valued at over $10 billion. Gilead's once daily, single tablet regimen HIV drugs are prescribed to more than 70% of newly diagnosed HIV patients in the United States. This past week, on March 1st the FDA approved Gilead's newest HIV drug, Odefsey, which contains tenofovir alafenamide a tenofovir prodrug that is shown to have the same efficacy as tenofivir at one-tenth the dose.
With such a groundbreaking portfolio of antiviral drugs, and with aspirations to expand their pipeline beyond antivirals, where the company's other products category generated $1.9 billion in sales in 2015, an increase of $200 million from 2014. Gilead has already generated massive revenues with their HCV drugs, yet, the company thinks that it has only served about 8-9% of an estimated 6.6 million HCV patients in the U.S and five major European countries, which leads many people to believe that there is room for growth in the antiviral space, and many analysts are very bullish on the biotech that has a remarkable record of performance. Gilead has almost quadrupled its revenue from $8.3 billion in 2011 to $32.6 billion in 2015, and the stock has returned 330% to shareholders in that same five-year period, and with $26.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents reported on the company's balance sheet, Gilead seems to be in a very secure position. Furthermore, in the beginning of February, Gilead announced that it would be raising its dividend to 10%, making the company look like a very attractive buy. All of these factors in mind, there are still some major considerations that need to be made when looking into the future of the company, and those are intense competition and the social, political and legal pressures that the company is facing in response to the pricing of their HCV cures, where a 12 week course of Harvoni treatment costs $94,500.
(Source: Gilead Sciences)
Despite Intense Competition, Gilead's HCV franchise still holds 95% of the market share.
AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) first challenged Gilead's HCV franchise, with the FDA approval of Viekira Pak in 2014, which priced at around $83,000, is not necessarily a bargain compared to Harvoni. Viekira Pak is believed to have more unwanted side effects and is therefore not a better alternative to Gilead's Harvoni. AbbVie's Hep-C had sales of $1.1 billion in the first 9 months of 2014, taking little market share from Gilead who did sales of $14.2 billion with their HCV drugs during the same 9 months. However, at the end of January, Merck (NYSE: MRK) has now initiated a price war for the American hepatitis C market with the FDA approval of Zepatier, which will be priced at $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, an approximate $35,000 discount to Harvoni. Could Merck's Zepatier, position itself as the cost leader in the HCV space, and compete with the already proven to be effective Sovaldi and Harvoni Franchise? Tim Anderson, a Bernstein analyst told the Wall Street Journal that Merck “can capture an 11% share of the hepatitis C market in 2017 with its new product, which would amount to about $2.2 billion sales.” If Mr. Anderson is correct, that means that it will take a year for Merck to do 14% what Gilead has already done in the first 9 months of 2015. However, in the United States the US Veteran Affairs Hospitals are among the largest single purchasers of Sovaldi and Harvoni, according to Gilead's Q4 conference call, has budgeted $1.5 billion dollars for the next year. Doing a calculation based on the listed prices (which the VA, most likely does not pay), the government would be able to treat over 15 thousand veterans using Gilead's Harvoni. If proven to be equally effective, and it seems likely that Zepatier could be a viable contender, the clinical studies showed that a 12 or 16 week regimen reduces the HCV virus to undetectable levels in more than 94% of patients. So, if Zepatier does not have considerable side effects, the VA's same $1.5 billion budget would be able to treat over 27 thousand veterans affected by hepatitis C, or 80% more patients than they would with Harvoni. I believe that when it comes to these key decisions, it is quite possible that prescribers will be heavily inclined to consider Merck's alternative. This is something that should be paid attention to when the VA begins to renegotiate their HCV budget. Merck believes that price constraints are a reason that many hepatitis patients still have not been treated, and has bet big on this approach. Citi analyst, Andrew Baum, explained in the Financial Times; “While Merck's hepatitis C agent is clearly inferior to incumbent competitors, we expect the launch of Zepatier to further drive net price reductions for all market participants.” Three weeks into the launch of the new entrant, Gilead's HCV franchise still holds 95% of the market share.
Legal action concerning the company's pricing policies has fairly low probability of success
Gilead has experienced backlash with regards to their pricing strategy for Sovaldi and Harvoni as spending on prescription drugs increased by over 12% last year, and political figures are looking at drug companies in order to contain their spending. In December two senators from the Committee of Finance, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Chuck Grassley of Iowa released the conclusion of their 18-month investigation into the pricing practices of Sovaldi. The duo looked through over 20,000 internal company documents and had extensive interviews with company executives. This investigation brought a lot of negative attention to Gilead as the senators concluded that their investigation “reveals a pricing and marketing strategy designed to maximize revenue with little concern for access or affordability.” Gilead believes that due to the pill's effectiveness in curing about 9 out of 10 patients, the drug is fairly priced as it can prevent future costs associated with hepatitis C, such as liver transplants. Ultimately, the Senate is trying to push for price controls on prescription drugs, a prospect that has frightened many biotech investors.
Beyond the public shaming by the Senate, Massachusetts Attorney General, Maura Healy, has threatened the company with a lawsuit, claiming that Gilead's pricing practices could be in violation of the state's Lawson unfair trade practices. In Gilead's 10-K the company addressed the legal action by explaining “In February 2016, the Massachusetts Attorney General's office served us with a Civil Investigative Demand requesting that we produce documents related to our HCV products. It is possible that the results of the Senate Committee investigation and any actions taken by the Massachusetts Attorney General or other state governments could result in negative publicity or other negative actions that could harm our reputation, reduce demand for Harvoni, Sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing products and/or reduce coverage of Harvoni, Sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing products.” Law professor, Dean Hashimoto, told the Wall Street Journal, that a lawsuit challenging high drug prices is “unusual”. Joshua Schimmer an analyst at Piper-Jaffray responded to the news of the lawsuit by saying in a note “While there is no perfect precedent for such a case, the probability of success seems fairly low given the likelihood that patent law trumps Chapter 93A regulations. Nonetheless, it does highlight challenges individual states are having affording healthcare costs for its Medicaid population.”

Hundreds of people took part in a silent march through Rotterdam on Tuesday to honor the victims of a mass shooting in a gay bar in Orlando during the early hours of Sunday morning. Dressed in rainbow colors and carrying rainbow flags, American flags and candles, they walked from cafe Ferry on Westblaak to the rainbow zebra crossing on Churchill square.
At the rainbow crossing participants lay flowers and lit candles before returning to the march's starting point. Several aldermen marched along, according to broadcaster NOS. No speeches were made.
The march was organized by Rotterdam's LGBT community and followed similar vigils in Amsterdam and The Hague.
During the early hours of Sunday morning Omar Mateen, an American of Afghan descent, opened fire in gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando. 49 people were killed. Shortly before the shooting Mateen called the emergency line to say that they were acting in the name of terrorist organization Islamic State.
"I hear from many people that it makes them angry. I was immediately very sad", Gert-Jan Verboom, one of the Rotterdam march's organizers, said to RTV Rijnmond. They added that they immediately thought of their Muslim friends and how painful it must be for them, something like this happening during Ramadan.
Verboom doesn't know what to think about the perpetrator's alleged religious motives. "People can make something ugly from everything. Whether it is religion, culture or sexual orientation. We mustn't do that, especially now. We should leave the labels and support each other as a community."

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Some politicians are irritated that a Rochester brewery receiving state economic development funding bought beer fermentation tanks from China that could have been produced in New York.
Three upstate members of the Assembly and the Little Falls mayor on Friday criticized Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and their economic development agency for not requiring state economic investments benefit New York businesses.
The lawmakers say Syracuse-based Feldmeier Equipment Inc., which has two factories on the banks of the Erie Canal in Little Falls, could have produced the 12 China-made 20-foot-by-60-foot tanks that are now being hauled to Genesee Brewing Co. via the canal.
A spokesperson for the brewery, Mary Beth Popp, said Genesee has bought seven tanks from Feldmeier over the last three years. They said Genesee reached out to the company for a bid on the 12 tanks but was turned down twice.
The Chinese tanks are too large to transport long distance by truck or rail, so they're floating the 225 miles to Rochester. They are set to arrive in Rochester later this week and will be transported the few miles between the canal and the brewery by specialty trucks. They already passed Little Falls on the canal last week, prompting protests from some Feldmeier workers.
"It disgusts me to know that state economic development dollars were used to support a project where goods were manufactured in China, when we have companies like Feldmeier Equipment that produce products like this right in the Mohawk Valley," Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, a Utica Democrat, said in a statement.
Genesee Brewing Co., in downtown Rochester, is eligible for about $10 million in grants and tax credits from the Empire State Development fund for its $50 million expansion project.
Empire State Development spokesperson Jason Conwall said none of those state incentives applied to the tank purchases. The project has to earn the state reimbursement money by meeting specific investment and job creation goals over the next 10 years. Those funds could then support future expansion for a restaurant and bar.
"Governor Cuomo and Empire State Development support New York State businesses, period," Conwall said.
Feldmeier vice president of sales Dave Pollock said the company submitted a bid for a smaller portion of the Genesee project but it was rejected.
"We lose bids every day, that's not a concern," Pollock said. "Genesee made a business decision to go with the lowest price, I assume, and they'll have to deal with public relations backlash of that."

Colombia's Farc rebels have declared a unilateral ceasefire for an indefinite period, starting from Saturday.
The leftist rebels said the truce should become a formal armistice and would only end if they were attacked.
The announcement was made in Cuba, where the Farc has been holding peace talks with the Colombian government.
President Juan Manuel Santos has so far refused to suspend military action, saying the rebels would use a bilateral truce to rearm and regroup.
The peace talks in Cuba - which began in 2012 - are aimed at ending five decades of conflict that has killed an estimated 220,000 people.
'Renewed pressure'
"We have resolved to declare a unilateral ceasefire and end hostilities for an indefinite period of time, which should be transformed into an armistice," the Farc said in a statement.
Colombia's largest rebel group had previously called for a bilateral truce - but these moves have been rejected by the government in Bogota.
The peace talks were almost derailed in September after the Farc captured Gen Ruben Dario Alzate, prompting President Santos to suspend the negotiations.
The rebels released the general unharmed in November in an effort to revive the talks.
But following Wednesday's announcement by the Farc, President Santos may come under renewed pressure now to match the rebel offer, BBC regional analyst Leonardo Rocha says.

At the Scouting Combine, Cardinals coach Bruce Arians told PFT Live that cornerback Patrick Peterson battled blood sugar issues during the 2014 season, and that Peterson had “borderline” diabetes. Peterson has now said that their condition goes beyond any borderline.
“I'd rather not go into deep detail about that,” Peterson initially told Kent Somers of azcentralsports.com. “It was a situation that it occurred during the season. The team docs found it and got it all under wraps.”
Peterson admitted that the situation affected them in 2014.
“No question it made a big difference and once they found out what the problem was, they put their hands around the throat, wrangled it and we moved forward from it,” Peterson said.
While the situation is under control, it's not cured; “I am a diabetic,” Peterson said.
Peterson, one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL, didn't specify whether they suffer from Type I or Type II diabetes. The diagnosis helps explain the decline in their play from last season, and we wish them the best as they prepare for 2015.

A California firefighter has been killed by a wildfire burning across Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.
Fire chief Ken Pimlott said the victim was apparatus engineer Cory Iverson, 32, a father-of-one whose wife is pregnant with a second child.
Iverson was part of a crew battling the Thomas Fire, one of six major blazes currently raging in the state.
The Thomas fire has grown to 379 square miles (981 sq km), becoming the fourth-largest in California's history.
It has destroyed more than 900 properties, including 729 homes, two residential apartment blocks, two hotels and 18 other commercial properties, and scorched an area the size of New York and Paris combined.
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) did not give out any more details about Iverson's death, but it followed reports earlier in the day of a fire unit being overrun by the blaze near the town of Fillmore.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The long battle against California wildfires
Cal Fire said on Thursday that the Thomas blaze was 30% contained, up from 20% on Tuesday, but it continues to grow.
The agency said 8,144 firefighters were tackling the blaze, using 1,004 fire engines, 59 water tenders and 80 bulldozers. More than 30 helicopters and six air tankers are reportedly involved in the fight.
Several thousand of those firefighters are prisoners. According to local news station KPBS, they are paid $2 per day and and additional $1 per hour when they are actively fighting fires.
Steep slopes and rocky terrain have made it dangerous to tackle the flames.
Efforts to combat the Thomas wildfire have already totalled more than $48 million (£36 million). Many local school districts have cancelled classes and will not reopen until after the new year.
The blaze - named according to where it started, near the Thomas Aquinas College - is by far the largest of six major fires alight in the state.
The Thomas fire shows no signs of letting up as gusts of wind up to 40mph (65km/h) and low humidity pose a continued challenge to firefighters.
'Fire is coming right at you'
By James Cook, Los Angeles Correspondent
Radio traffic between firefighters and their controllers on Thursday morning gave a glimpse of the terrifying reality of tackling this monster blaze.
"Fire is coming right at you," said one message as units in the Fillmore area on the far eastern edge of the wildfire were ordered to pull back.
The weather had apparently changed suddenly, posing a threat to the lives of the firefighters in the area.
There were reports of a Mayday call, a rescue helicopter was scrambled and controllers attempted to contact a firefighter who was said to be "down" in the area.
The confirmation that a fire engineer had died came quickly. The man's family have been told of their death.
00:32 Think It's Cold? Think Again! Meteorologist Ari Sarsari talks about the latest report from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, showing just how warm this winter season really was.
The winter of 2014-15 was the warmest on record worldwide, according to the state of the climate report released by the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on Wednesday.
<img class="styles__noscript__2rw2y" src="https://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/djfinse.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0" srcset="https://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/djfinse.jpg?v=at&w=485&h=273&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 400w, https://dsx.weather.com//util/image/w/djfinse.jpg?v=ap&w=980&h=551&api=7db9fe61-7414-47b5-9871-e17d87b8b6a0 800w" > Departure from average temperature December-February. Red areas were above average and blue areas were below average.
NOAA says that December through February – for meteorological record-keeping purposes, winter is defined as those three months in the Northern Hemisphere – was 1.42 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th-century average for all land and ocean areas. This tops the previous warmest winter of 2007 by 0.05 degrees Fahrenheit. Global temperature records are available for the period 1880-2015.
Individually, here is how each month ranked for the earth:
- December 2014: Warmest on record.
- January 2015: Second warmest on record.
- February 2015: Second warmest on record.
Though it was a cold winter overall in eastern North America, including the United States, the Northern Hemisphere also saw its warmest winter on record. This was due to widespread above-average temperatures in western North America, Europe and Asia. NOAA says that record warmth was observed in the western United States, portions of central Siberia and eastern Mongolia.
(MORE: Warmest Winter For Many U.S. Cities )
For the United States alone, winter 2014-15 was the 19th warmest on record.
(MORE: U.S. Winter Recap )
The Southern Hemisphere also saw warmer-than-average temperatures for this period, which constitutes the summer months there. Overall, the December-February period ranked as the fourth warmest on record for all land and ocean areas. Australia recorded its fifth warmest summer on record.
Yesterday, Panjab police arrived in large numbers and cordoned off Bapu Surat Singh's home in Hassanpur. An ambulance remained outside until the early hours of the night, increasing the threat that Bapu Ji may once again be forcibly removed and taken to hospital. Since January 16, 2015, Surat Singh Khalsa, an 83-year-old activist, has been on a fast-unto-death seeking release of Sikh prisoners who have completed their full jail terms and are legitimately due for release. What they got in return is a forced confinement at a hospital in Ludhiana where they are being force-fed and subjected to dubious medical procedures – a conduct that is being called inhuman by many.
What is Surat Singh's demand?
Singh has claimed that there are at least 43 Sikh prisoners across several prisons in the country who have completed their full jail terms, but are still being held in their old age. They demand their release. As reported by scroll “The least the state government can do is work to bring them back to Punjab, making it easier for their families to visit them,” Singh said. “Arrogant rulers may not listen, but people do.”
Why are Singh's demands being ignored?
Sumedh Singh Saini, the Director General of Police, Punjab, said in a press conference that a list discussed by Surat Singh contained 82 names, some of whom have been arrested as recently as 2014, and that several were undertrials. The Supreme Court had stayed the release of life convicts across the country with an order in July 2014, and in some cases, the prisoners were jailed in other states.
Is Singh's demands valid?
Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, the lawyer aiding Surat Singh, said that the list discussed by the DGP contained 200 names, of which an estimated 70 to 75 prisoners have indeed served over 15 to 20 years of their jail term. Arjun Sheoran, a lawyer associated with People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said that the Punjab government's claim that the state was unable to act because of a Supreme Court stay on release of life prisoners in 2014 was inaccurate and that an interim application could be filed.
Inhuman treatment of Surat Singh
After the first three weeks of their fast getting totally ignored by the govt., over a hundred police officers forcefully shifted Surat Singh from their house to a civil hospital on February 8, where they were placed under preventive arrest. Allegedly, in order to force-feed him, food pipes have been stitched on the activist's forehead in an unhygienic and unscientific manner, which resulted in an infection.
The country's largest civil rights organizations, PUCL said that if the allegations are true, they amount to inflicting torture and inhuman, cruel, degrading and illegal treatment, and that the state is denying Surat Singh their right to indulge in a non-violent, democratic act of protesting.
Besides, Surat Singh's son, Ravinderjit Singh, a U.S. citizen, who visited India to look after their father, was held under Indian police custody for two months under charges of being “likely to commit a breach of the peace”. After their release on April 27, Ravinder says they were tortured multiple times and that their life was in danger. They have alleged that the police blackmailed them to manipulate Surat into stopping their protest.
Privacy guidelines may soon be put in place for drones flying within the US. According to Politico, President Obama plans to issue an executive order to have a set of voluntary privacy guidelines drafted for commercial drones. The guidelines would help protect citizens as these small aircraft — often carrying cameras — become increasingly available. Politico reports that it is not yet known when the order will be issued, but that the White House is working to figure out the proper policy.
A Commerce Department arm will determine the guidelines
Rather than issue the order to the Federal Aviation Administration, which is in charge of regulating drones, the order will instead ask that an arm of the Commerce Department create the rules. That arm, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, will reportedly work with companies and advocate groups to determine the guidelines.
Of course, the actual use of commercial drones is still in a fairly convoluted place thanks to the FAA. It's currently working toward establishing clear guidelines for their legal use — as it's been directed to do by Congress — but those don't have to be in place until September 2015.
ANN ARBOR, MI - Washtenaw Dairy is trying something different: weekend delivery of some of the county's favorite doughnuts.
Makai McClintock, one of the night managers at the Washtenaw Dairy, said employees are making multiple varieties of doughnuts and delivering to customers Friday and Saturday night from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. It is the first time Washtenaw Dairy has experimented with residential delivery.
"Typically we make them overnight for the morning and we usually have doughnut makers in early, but all the doughnuts we make tonight will be fresh," McClintock said.
A Facebook post on the Washtenaw Dairy page has already garnered some interest from customers.
Friday 2/17 and Saturday 2/18 are the first two days of our doughnut delivery! We'll be delivering from 9 pm to 2 am... Posted by Washtenaw Dairy on Thursday, February 16, 2017
"We've had a really good turnout in terms of people calling and asking questions," McClintock said.
Customers have been asking for delivery of this kind for a while, they added, from University of Michigan students needing a midnight snack to health care professionals looking for a quick treat.
"If it's popular as we are anticipating, it is definitely something we'd consider rolling out on different days and different times," McClintock said. "I think there's a pretty good variety of people who are interested in it and this particular time frame."
Doughnuts are $9 a dozen, or $4.50 for a half dozen and 75 cents per additional doughnut, with a $2 delivery charge and a one dozen order minimum. Delivery must be within a three-mile radius of the dairy, located at 602 S. Ashley St.
"It's going to be a busy night, but we're really excited," McClinktock said.
﻿YEMEN, A FORGOTTEN CONFLICT
Over ten thousand victims, 32 thousand wounded, three million IDPs and an impressive series of systematic human rights violations. Yemen is presently a country split in three parts, each ruled by a different entity: the Houthi rebels supported by ousted president Ali Abdullah Saleh, a so-called “legitimate” president in exile, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, and AQIP, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Caught in the middle, the civilian population is suffering under the blows of the warring parties.
The Saudis bomb civilian targets (refugee camps, hospitals and schools included) and employ cluster bombs (banned under international treaties) indiscriminately. They also adopt a perverse tactic: they bomb a target, wait for rescue teams to reach the location, and then bomb again. The Houthi rebellion isn't any better: they use human shields and forcibly recruit child soldiers, that represent an estimated 30% of the fighters on the ground. A similar behaviour can be found in the loyalist troops of president Hadi.
A homeless population, forced to flee from one combat zone to the next, without any health support as hospitals have become a primary targets. Over 14 million people have no access to drinking water and are at risk of famine because of the international embargo on Yemen and of the Saudi bombing of transport infrastructures and roads. The civilians are basically caught in a trap: the Saudi desert to the north and an international naval blockade to the south.
In the meantime, the poorest country in the Middle East is on the verge of collapsing: almost half of all businesses have shut down, the GDP has fallen 35-40% since the outbreak of the war. However, international public opinion does not pay any attention to the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe, its attention grabbed by other crisis in the region: the civil war in Syria, the fight against the ISIS, the Kurdish struggle, the US-Russia competition.
Who's responsible
The conflict in Yemen has been fueled by a number of actors. The main one is Saudi Arabia. The kingdom started the conflict to hamper the growing Iranian influence in the country after Teheran sided with the Houthi rebellion. The struggle for regional dominance isn't the only motivation that pushed the Saudis to intervene. The new king Salman and especially the ruler's son, Mohammed, that aspires to become the heir apparent to the throne, have pushed their country in the spotlight through an aggressive foreign policy. However, since Saudi Arabia's direct intervention in the conflict in March 2015, the military success Riyadh was yearning for has not materialized. In fact, the Saudis have launched a war on Yemen a month after the Houthi rebels and president Hadi had signed a peace agreement. The deal called for the withdrawal of the Houthis from parts of Sana'a and the formation of a government of national unity.
The US, UK and France are all supportive of the Saudi military initiative. British and American officers station in the military command centers that choose the targets to bomb. While the French are flooding both the Saudis and the UAE with their weapons. The US support is the price to pay for the “betrayal” of the traditional Saudi ally in favor of a deal on Iran's nuclear programme. The anglo-american influence has not prevented the war from going astray. They simply looked the other way when international NGOs condemned the systematic human rights violations. The fresh British Secretary of State, Boris Johnson, has done even better than American mutism: they denied that abuses ever took place. The Saudi's lack of familiarity with the concept of human rights completed the bleak picture.
John Kerry
Negotiations without a solution
There have been a series of talks to put an end to the conflict. The latest round was held in Kuwait and failed miserably in August after three months of futile discussions. Immediately after their collapse the bombings resumed. During the latest visit by the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, in Riyadh a new proposal emerged: cessation of hostilities, withdrawal of the Houthis from the Yemeni capital, which they conquered in September 2014, and the handing over of all their artillery and weapons. In other words: you must surrender. This is not a proposition, it's a joke.
With the support of once president Saleh, the Houthis have set up a “Supreme political council” to rule the country; on the other end, the “legitimate” president Hadi, whose government is in exile, claims that they can rule the country thanks to the abundant oil revenues. None of the parties seems ready for or willing to compromise. The rebels are using the Parliament, whose mandate expired in 2009, to seek legitimacy, whilst Hadi is struggling to make their way back to the capital with Saudi military muscle. In the meantime, the AQAP terrorists are exploiting the civil war to strengthen and to exercise their control over some areas in Yemen, and especially in Hadhramaut on the border with Oman.
The conflict in Yemen has also taken its toll on Saudi finances. The growing budget deficit and the collapse of oil prices has led to a 20% cut to the salaries of Saudi public employees. On the opposite front, the Yemenis are used to living in poverty and know how to manage their subsistence economy and supply themselves on the black market. In fact, the Houthis are even financing their war though the levies they are imposing on the population. Oil exports, which used to represent roughly 50% of the country's State income, have now been blocked. While billions of dollars will be necessary to rebuild a country torn apart by the conflict. That is, when a peace deal is signed.
Yet, there seems to be no end in sight for this conflict. Military operations have stalled. The Saudi army and its over 100 thousand troops benefit from US logistical support and are assisted by units coming from several other countries: a thousand Egyptians, 800/900 Sudanese, a thousand from Qatar, a brigade provided by the UAE, plus a couple of thousand Colombian mercenaries, an artillery battalion from Kuwait, 300 from Bahrein and 2.100 soldiers from Senegal. These figures don't account for the Yemeni army soldiers loyal to Hadi. And these are just the troops on the ground, to which we have to add around 100 Saudi fighter jets, plus airplanes from other nations (Jordan, Egypt, UAE, Bahrein, Morocco, Sudan, Kuwait and Qatar). This massive display of force has not been capable of defeating about 100 thousand Houthi rebels and the remnants of troops loyal to former president Saleh. What is even worse: the conflict has now spilled over into Saudi Arabia with the sporadic raids by the Ansar Allah militias and the launch of missiles.
We all know that the Houthis are receiving support from Iran and are being trained by Hezbollah. A delegation of rebels has recently visited Baghdad to seek, at least officially, humanitarian support from the Iraqi Shia-dominated government. This initiative can only further fuel the Shia-Sunni sectarian divide that has spread across the Middle East. It's not a coincidence that it was also one of the main causes for the outbreak of the war in Yemen.
The United States are trying, via the UN, to form a government of national unity. The initiative is theoretically supported by both the “legitimate” president and the rebels. However, the disagreement is over the details of the deal. The Houthis will never withdraw from Sana'a nor hand over their weapons without anything in return. They want a federal system, greater territorial autonomy, regardless of who is at the helm in the capital. A regional structure was part of the negotiations that failed in February 2014 and that eventually led to the Houthis taking over Sana'a in September. Everyone was in favor of a federalist Yemen. The rebels were because it allowed them to maintain the control over the north of the country – and this is basically what they are still demanding – and for similar reasons the idea was also appreciated by the secessionists in the south.

A recent poll shows that support for medical marijuana in Texas continues to grow, however full legalization is another matter entirely.
TEGNA Media, which owns a wide-ranging portfolio of media outlets and reaches one-third of all television households nationwide, recently conducted a poll on a multitude of issues and found that 71 percent of Texans are in favor of medical marijuana.
About 19 percent are still opposed to patients having medical marijuana, while another 11 percent are undecided.
A limited medical marijuana extract was legalized during the 2015 Texas legislative session, and sets up the possibility of companies producing CBD oil by 2017. This will only be available to epilepsy patients who have already ruled out brain surgery as a treatment option.
“The fact that even Republicans, by a margin of almost 71 percent, support marijuana uses for medicinal health reasons I think suggests that this is where you're beginning to see the trend,” said Bob Stein, KHOU's political analyst.
These figures have been steadily climbing over the years.
Legalizing marijuana for recreational purposes garnered 41 percent support, with 49 percent opposing and 10 percent undecided.
Other polls have shown support for fully legalizing marijuana in Texas has been anywhere between 46 and 52 percent.
The poll did not ask about decreasing the penalty for marijuana possession, which recently garnered almost 75 percent support.
Several bills were introduced during the 2015 state legislative session which addressed all of these issues. Bills fully legalizing marijuana and making possession of small amounts a ticket only fine were passed out of committee, however the legislature did not hear or vote on them. A whole plant medical marijuana bill had enough votes to pass out of committee but was not voted on due to the Public Health Committee chair refusing to allow a vote.
That state legislator at one point turned off the phones in their office because they were receiving so many calls to put the bill to a vote. Rep. Myra Crownover, a Republican from Denton, opted not to run for re-election afterwards.

Travel Insurance Facilities said its investigation was "regrettably conclusive".

Ms Gates, from Emsworth, Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and has been receiving treatment for secondary tumours since.
Friends and family helped to raise money to send Ms Gates, husband Jason, and daughters Brooke and Charley, to Florida.

US doctors treating their broken leg also found their cancer had deteriorated further.
Since their admission to hospital on 21 June, Ms Gates has amassed a $131,000 (£101,000) medical bill.
Ms Wilson said Ms Gates' insurance company had cited an unrelated medical condition from their past as a reason not to pay out.
"It's a rip off, they are using a loophole from their medical history from years ago, it has nothing to do with their cancer."

The family hopes to fly Ms Gates back to the UK in a special air ambulance, which they believe will cost £65,000.
A Go Fund Me website appeal has been launched in a bid to fund the family's medical bills and any travel costs.
Ms Wilson said: "A holiday of a lifetime has turned into a disaster.
"She's on borrowed time, the risk and worry is that they could pass away out there."
Travel Insurance Facilities said it would not pay out after carrying out a full investigation.
In a statement, the firm said: "We are truly sorry for the unfortunate circumstances - our thoughts are with them all at this difficult time".

It had been a surreal journey through the dark heart of Ayrshire in the early hours of the morning until spotlights lit up the sky to guide us to a random collection of tents in a field near Tarbolton.
Under canvas, thousands of people were gripped by the dance culture which was just beginning to capture the hearts and minds of a generation.
Hours later, as the ecstatic final notes of a house anthem faded a laconic American voice emerged from the echoes:

"Just what is it that you want to do?
We wanna be free
We wanna be free to do what we wanna do
And we wanna get loaded
And we wanna have a good time
That's what we're gonna do
We're gonna have a good time
We're gonna have a party"

The tent went nuts.
Of all the rock bands who tried to capture the spirit of the early days of that movement, none succeeded with anything close to the euphoria of Glasgow's own Primal Scream.
Their single Loaded was an essential highlight of raves springing up all over the country.
The band's classic Screamadelica album portrayed the joy, hedonism and experimentation of an era which knew, even then, that the comedown could not be postponed forever and would be terrible to bear. Those who flew higher than the sun would inevitably get burned.

When Primal Scream walk on to the stage at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Bandstand tonight they will do so as homecoming heroes, claiming their rightful place as the most influential band ever to emerge from Scotland.
Any band can knock off the odd great tune. A fair number can come up with one or even two solid gold classics. Few can transform music itself and open a door to a new future as Primal Scream did in the earliest days of the 1990s.
Glasgow has, of course, produced more than its fair share of classic rock 'n' roll bands, who cannot be lightly dismissed. So let's look at the contenders.
Video: Frightened Rabbit - Get Out [Official Video]
Let's first shake off the challenges from current indie faves The Twilight Sad and Frightened Rabbit who are good but not quite good enough. Too young, probably too nice and certainly too niche.
Chvrches? Thrilling synth pop, a great singer and oodles of potential to make a serious impact in America, but at this stage in the game more influenced than influencers.
Franz Ferdinand have at least one classic under their belts in Take Me Out, but they're just a little too knowing, just a little too 'art school' for their own good.
Or then there are The Associates, who for a time at least combined an avant grade sensibility with enough commercial nous to have actual huge hits. But with a singer as unique and mercurial as Billy Mackenzie, The Associates were a dazzling one-off to be admired with awe rather than copied.
Belle and Sebastian have certainly attracted a faithful following, which is part of the problem. Lovely songs but their gigs are too much like going to church.

The twin pillars of Postcard Records: Orange Juice and Aztec Camera? Just a bit historic, a bit out of time to still remain current, although it would take a harder heart than mine to remain unmoved by the genius of Rip It Up.
The Vaselines had songs covered by Nirvana. Everyone of a certain age loves The Pastels and the BMX Bandits. What else is there to say about either?
Lloyd Cole and the Commotions seemed poised to conquer the world when Perfect Skin combined a literary sensibility and a pop reinterpretation of The Velvet Underground. But they stalled.

Then there are the big, populist choices: The Bluebells, the Bay City Rollers and The Average White Band have each had a hit that now seems almost part of the Scottish psyche. The Skids and Big Country have had a couple each. The Proclaimers have had a whole string of them. Brilliant tunes all, but perhaps a little musically safe for our purposes here.
Simple Minds were once one of the biggest bands in the world, conquering America through a key role in the soundtrack of The Breakfast Club.
Texas had an astonishing run of hits after perfecting a modernised version of pop soul on their album White on Blonde.

The Waterboys hit big with The Whole of the Moon but preferred the more traditional pleasures of folk.
It wasn't that long ago that no festival was complete without the singalong classics of Travis, just as Biffy Clyro's sleek rock anthems are festival favourites today.
This is becoming difficult and we have not even reached the very top of the mountain, where we have to breathe in the same rarified atmosphere as Scotland's rock gods.

Here live Mogwai, sonic sculptors, adventurers in noise, the very definition of post rock. Trouble is that most of the people for whose lives Mogwai provide the soundtrack are undead. And French.
Over there are Blue Nile; deep and drowning in beautiful existential melancholy. The Cocteau Twins, whose swirling atmospherics hold aloft one of popular music's most captivating voices, capable of stealing your soul simply by singing gibberish. Both hard acts to follow.
The Sensational Alex Harvey Band: theatrical, passionate, powerful, unique and pretty much unequalled still, 43 years after the release of their seminal Next album.

Teenage Fanclub, three brilliant songwriters, heavenly voices. After 10 studio albums and two compilations we might be tempted to take their heartbreaking beauty for granted if not for the fact they sound as fresh and alive as ever on their album Here, just released and just superb.
And, towering above even these, the Jesus and Mary Chain, whose raging torrent of feedback can make even The Sex Pistols sound tame or capture a desolate urban beauty when combined with the Reid Brothers' addiction to melody.
And so, with such riches in Scotland's past and present, what makes Primal Scream - formed by the Mary Chain's drummer Bobby Gillespie and Jim Beattie in 1982 - greater and more important than any of these?

It's not just that they steal from the very best, although they certainly do that.
Screamadelica twists and turns through deep soul, gospel, country, dub, psychedelia, house and even free jazz, referencing everyone from Lee Perry to Steve 'Silk' Hurley. It takes the mixing skills of DJ Andrew Weatherall to fuse it all into a cohesive whole.
On the albums that followed Screamadelica - some brilliant other rather less so - their sticky fingers continue to pinch from George Clinton, MC5, The Stooges, Miles Davis, Can, the Chemical Brothers and, throughout their entire career, the swagger and swing of the greatest rock 'n' roll band the world has ever seen … The Rolling Stones.

But it takes more than impeccable taste to achieve greatness, to grow into something far, far more than merely the sum of expertly chosen parts.
Primal Scream realised that what united the very different musics they combined, wasn't musicianship or skill, but something far more important: attitude, sensibility and outlook … a rebel stance.
They knew that where rock snobbery and fandom was unlikely to change the world, the dance floor, where one nation came together under a groove, could prove a revolutionary liberation. That, far from being apolitical, hedonism could be a force for radical change. To misquote George Clinton ... free your ass and your mind will follow.

I've seen Primal Scream bring the rave to the Ayr hall which would later become the infamous Hangar 13. I've seen them in full-on punk mode at dance festivals and almost blow a tent away at Glasgow Green. I've seen them at T in the Park and the Wickerman Festival.
Infuriatingly, I don't think I've ever seen them perform a completely satisfying set but each gig has contained peaks few other bands are capable of reaching.
So tonight at the Kelvingrove Bandstand, no matter how lost you have been, you will be found; no matter how blind, you will see.
You may or may not get loaded but you will get deep down, you will party and you will get out of the darkness into the light.
Just don't forget to give praise for the band that Primal Scream became in the white heat of rave culture and continue to be all these decades later.
Thousands of people labouring in hot temperatures have been succumbing to a deadly kidney disease, and as the planet warms, the problem is likely to spread
A mysterious and deadly kidney disease has been plaguing labourers in the sugar fields of Central America. In the past 20 years, some 20,000 workers have died of the disease, and the crisis has been growing worse.
At first the epidemic was thought to be caused by chemicals such as pesticides, but the disease only affected labourers in coastal areas – those working at higher altitude in hills were largely unaffected.
Heat stress: the next global public health crisis? Read more
A recent study found that hard work in the hot climate of the lowlands left workers dehydrated, putting such a heavy strain on their kidneys that it fatally damaged them. “When it's extremely hot, the risk for kidney damage really begins to become evident,” said Richard Johnson of the University of Colorado, Denver.
Similar epidemics of kidney disease were also found in farmworkers in other hot climates, in Sri Lanka, Egypt and Andhra Pradesh in India. And as global temperatures rise and heat waves become more intense, so the new type of kidney disease is increasing, according to the study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.
Another impact of global warming is more cases of kidney stones. This painful condition results from salts crystallising in the kidneys, often caused by dehydration. In the US, around 50% more cases of kidney stones occur in the warm climate of southern regions than northern states.
And the number of cases has been rising since temperatures began to warm noticeably in the late 1970s, especially in the summer. As the climate warms further, the high-risk zone for kidney stones is expected to expand northwards, with many more new cases predicted.

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Pau Gasol has something that the rest of their teammates cannot grasp at this point in their careers -- championship perspective.
The 14-year veteran is the only member of the Chicago Bulls who has been a star contributor on a team that won an NBA championship. So as the Bulls creep closer to the postseason and try to find their way in the middle of an emotional up-and-down season, one that reached another high point during Sunday night's last-minute comeback 98-97 win over the Orlando Magic, Gasol offered a somber reminder for their teammates over the final 30 regular-season games.
This Bulls team was built to win now, so there should be a sense of urgency.
Pau Gasol had 25 points and 15 rebounds along with the game-winning putback slam in the closing seconds to beat Orlando. Reinhold Matay/USA TODAY Sports
"It's hard to understand for younger guys that haven't been around as much," said the 34-year-old Gasol, who won two NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers. "So yeah, the windows are small. And when you have a gap, you got to go for it with everything you've got. Otherwise somebody else will. It's just plain and simple. If it's not you, it's going to be somebody else. It just comes down to how bad do you want it?"
The Bulls continue to show glimpses that they want it badly, but do they want it badly enough? They deserve credit for winning Sunday's game despite trailing by six points in the final 36.6 seconds, but the Magic have lost 38 games for a reason. Had it not been for a litany of mistakes by a young Orlando squad, the Bulls would have lost to a terrible team yet again. Just how unlikely was a Bulls victory down six with 36.6 seconds remaining? According to ESPN Stats & Information research, teams down six with 30-40 seconds remaining were 17-1,376 over the past 15 seasons going into Sunday's games. The Bulls won No. 18.
The Bulls were happy to have earned a win, but Gasol -- who had 25 points, 15 rebounds and the eventual game-winner with a rebound dunk of a Derrick Rose miss with 9.4 seconds remaining -- didn't mince words in regards to how their team should be feeling.
"I think it's too early," Gasol said of taking a step forward. "I think [Saturday in a rout of the New Orleans Pelicans] we did a really good job. That was a step forward. Today we started off like it was going to be another step forward, but it was almost a step back. Let's face it, we got away with one here.
"Again, it's a pattern. It's something that keeps happening and we need to be aware. Just because we won tonight -- now we got two home games that we need to win. We need to win. There's no way around it. We got to do better at home, we got to come out with fire, and that's what we need to do as a team, as a group, individuals and collectively."
As the Bulls return home for nine of the next 10 at the United Center, beginning with the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday, swingman Jimmy Butler believes their team is playing with a little more urgency these days.
"Definitely," they said. "Before you know it, the All-Star break is going to be over and then 30-something games left. Then it's playoff time so there's no time for mistakes and letups. We need to correct everything now."
After six straight games on the road, it's hard to see any kind of major progress. The Bulls dominated the Pelicans on Saturday night only after Anthony Davis injured their shoulder. They won Sunday night's game only because the Magic disintegrated down the stretch. The only consistency over the past month for the Bulls is that they've been inconsistent. But in this year, after two wins on the road, Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau will take them any way they can get them.
"The thing is if you want to be a good team, you're going to have to find different ways to win and that's what I did like about tonight," Thibodeau said. "Down six with 30 seconds, you got to find a way to win, and that's what we did. We had some good fortune, but we made it go our way. Hopefully we can get home, gather ourselves and get ready for the next one."
There's a book that's grown a cult-like following over the past couple of years that you may be familiar with called The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. It probably belongs in its own genre somewhere between self-help and homemaking.
At its surface, Marie Kondo's bestseller is about how you organize and declutter your home. But, they also suggest doing so can change your mental behavior. It can make you calmer. It can put you at peace. It can make you happier. And at least a few million other readers believe it can. I do too.
That's because I've experienced this first-hand with a different kind of space—DoneDone's codebase. For over eight years, we've been tidying it up as we go. The priority we've given to simply making the code better over time is the main reason I still really love working on the product.
The lifecycle of most codebases tends toward eventual rot. Some codebases get there really quickly. Others get there gradually. But, they all eventually get there. For some reason, the pull of feature enhancements, time constraints, developer fatigue, and business priorities always push code toward its own death. When tidying up code isn't made a top priority, this will always be its general trajectory.
But, selling the concept of “cleaning up” with no measurable or immediate gain is futile. Why devote two weeks of developer-time to something that doesn't give anyone but developers a boon? Even further, how does anyone know that the clean-up was worth it when you can't really measure it?
These questions end up becoming rhetorical. Hence, devoting time to just tidying up rarely gets any widespread support within a business.
I wish I could write up a report that tell us DoneDone has been more successful because we took the time to straighten out its strewn permissions layer two years ago. Or, during the release of our new @mentions feature, we took time to DRY up and reduce some long-standing service methods. Or, any of the countless other micro-refactorings we've done both on the server and client-side to keep the code fresh. But, I don't have any metrics. And to be honest, there are probably clean-ups we've done that would take years to justify from a time-savings standpoint.
What I can say for sure is this: Giving developers time to consistently better their own codebase keeps developers passionate about working on that codebase for the long run. If it means pushing out a feature release an extra few days, it is almost unequivocally worth it. Because, in the end, the benefit of enjoying the space you work in every day needs no metric.

With pedal-assisted electric drive, regenerative braking, a lightweight fiberglass shell, and a tablet computer as the control panel, the Human Electric Vehicle integrates elements of both EVs and bicycles into a high-tech hybrid vehicle.
This project vehicle, which began in late 2010, is a great illustration of the ability to fuse design and ingenuity into a working prototype of a lightweight personal electric vehicle.
From the first 3D rendering to the finished vehicle, the designer, Lyon Smith, stayed true to the initial design constraints, and came up with a hybrid vehicle that is not only fast and stylish, but that has enough of a range to make it a viable personal transportation option for commuting (or just for fun).
"The concept of this project was to design and build a vehicle, which is a hybrid between a bicycle, a motorcycle, a car, and a dynamo. Pedal power creates electricity through the design, by pedalling and charging the batteries with magnetic generators and a gear reducer, which turbo charges the speed at which the generators spin. I was asked to come up with designs on how this vehicle was to look, perform, and function. The main constraints were weight, size, the requirement that this was to be a three-wheel vehicle." - Lyon Smith
Smith's partner Rich Kronfeld, a bicycle enthusiast, wanted to come up with a vehicle that combined an electric drive with pedal power, and with an initial grant from the Minnesota Dept of Commerce and the help of a canoe company, an engineering firm, a boiler company, and the engineering department at Winona State University, the two have created a unique three-wheeled hybrid.
"It's a hybrid car, motorcycle, kayak bike. It could be a revolutionary vehicle. I think we created something really interesting here.” - Smith
The Human Electric Vehicle, which is street-legal, weighs in at about 700 pounds, and is technically a motorcycle. The outer shell of carbon fiber is laid over a foam structural core (with similarities to building both a kayak and an airplane), and serves to cover the custom-built chassis, which holds the pedal-power components and battery system, as well as the suspension and electric motor in the rear hub. The vehicle is said to have a top speed of about 100 MPH, with a range of 75 miles (or farther, depending on the amount of pedal-assist from the driver). It includes a small solar panel on its roof, and a regenerative braking system to recapture some of the energy while driving.
According to Inhabitat, the prototype was displayed at the Minnesota Marine Art Museum this spring, and the team is working on another iteration of the design for possible launch in June, with the hopes of attracting investors to bring a production model to market.
Stay up with news on further development of the Human Electric Vehicle on their Facebook Page.
Last week we took a look at various support talents which were expected to have a major impact on the game. It turned out, however, that their impact on the game was potentially overestimated, with the alternative frequently being a superior choice.
Today, we would like to discuss the talents, which have the highest winrate discrepancy, compared to the alternative. While some of the alternatives are similarly at risk of being an effect of a game-losing scenario, rather than a cause, many talent choices in this list can be looked at as independent from the state of the game. Data is based on the statistics from the first two weeks of 7.xx Dota.
Io is a rather weak pub hero—only in 4k+ games does their winrate start to get respectable, and even then, it is still below 50%. However, there is a clear winrate progression, which increases depending on the average skill of the game. It's reasonable to draw the conclusion that the hero can become truly scary the more skilled and coordinated the players of a team are. The professional scene certainly agrees.
Io has two talents on the list, which have >5% difference in winrate, compared to the alternative. At level 15, they have a choice between extra 10 strength or +10 mana regeneration. At level 20, the choice is between +120 GPM or +20 health regeneration. In either case, going for regeneration is more likely to result in a victory.
Considering what role Io generally fills in the game, the results are very unsurprising. A good Io player should avoid being on the front lines and the hero is very item-independent. Moreover, regeneration boosts scale exceptionally well with their Tether, since they provide 1.5x the amount to an allied target. Even at a point, where a support Io has reached level 20, extra 30 HP/sec can make a huge difference for a core. On the other hand, getting +120 GPM in a game, that is likely to end in the next 15 minutes or less, is generally a poor choice.
At level 25, Skywrath Mage has a choice between +14 mana regeneration or -4s on Ancient Seal's cooldown. Interestingly, it is the +14 mana regeneration that wins by a huge margin—7.1% difference in winrate.
Cooldown reduction talents generally perform rather well, especially on caster heroes. Skywrath Mage's case is a bit different, as only the cooldown of a single ability is changed.
Ancient Seal is a very strong silence—6s can become a genuine problem for a variety of heroes, especially as it also significantly amplifies the incoming magic damage. By the time Skywrath Mage reaches level 25, the enemy is very likely to have answers to the silence in the form of Black King Bar, Manta Style, Guardian Greaves or Lotus Orb. However, this talent corresponds to almost 30% cooldown reduction or a 17% increase in the ability uptime, allowing to have it available, when the enemy is vulnerable again.
+14 mana regen is a deceptively strong level 25 talent. The extra regeneration is massive, often more than doubling the mana regeneration of a support Skywrath Mage. Moreover, it almost certainly guarantees a continuous use of Arcane Bolt, which is a 300+ damage nuke on a 2s cooldown.
Overall, the sample size for this statistic is probably very small—Skywrath Mage rarely reaches level 25, especially when played as a support. Hence, absorb this information with a degree of caution—a massive winrate difference does not necessarily indicate a massive difference between the power levels of the talents.
At level 20, Tidehunter gets a choice between either +6 mana regen or +15 strength. Once again, the extra regeneration wins, with a 6.7% winrate difference.
More often than not, the main goal of a Tidehunter player is to provide a clean initiation or a timely counter-initiation. After that, their impact on the fight is restricted to incoming right-click damage reduction and armor decrease/slow on a priority target. While both of these aspects should not be underestimated, the duration of a typical fight should allow the hero to continuously use their abilities without thinking about the manapool too much.
An average Tidehunter has roughly ~1100 manas at level 20—typically built Guardian Greaves and Force Staff cover most of the hero's mana requirements. In good games, having a Shiva's Guard or a Lotus Orb, on top of these most frequently built items, is also not out of the question. Therefore, the winrate discrepancy can be looked at as a consequence of a rough start, with frequently dying Tidehunters opting for a safer option with the extra health.
The hero in their current state is almost “perfectly balanced” with an average winrate of almost 50% across all brackets. That said,has one of the highest differences between talent selections at level 20—taking +2 damage per soul is significantly more effective compared to 15% evasion.
Once again, the safety option having a lower winrate might be associated with an already game-losing scenario, however it should not subtract too much from what impact the +2 damage per soul has.
+2 damage per soul results in extra +72 damage on a fully loaded Shadow Fiend—the number itself is already quite scary, regardless of context. Moreover, it also provides a neat safety net for the hero, preventing them from being very weak after a buyback/respawn.
Additionally, this makes Aghanim's Scepter a significantly more effective purchase—going for a “caster Fiend” is no longer necessarily associated with a massive right-click DPS drop, and it still provides a nice ultimate improvement as well as some survivability for the hero.
The early level talents are definitely the most interesting to look at, since at this point in the game, the probable outcome is not as clearly defined, and the talent itself has a lot more time to prove its worth.
Kunkka gets a very interesting choice at level 10—either +20 damage or +150 manas, with the choice of mana having a significantly higher winrate—a 5.6% difference.
The idea of a support Kunkka has been viable for a very long time. The most recent significant changes to it were proposed by VG.LaNm, during the pre-TI6 period. Their support Kunkka almost always went for Phase Boots followed by an Armlet of Mordiggian. This allowed the hero to remain an adequate damage source for the majority of the game, since their cleave damage ignores armor value.
At the same time, this build leaves support Kunkka (with Magic Wand) with roughly 470 manas at level 10—barely enough for a full combo and an additional Torrent. +150 mana extends the usefulness of the hero by almost a full X Marks the Spot+ Torrent combination, which, if performed properly, corresponds to extra 300 magical damage and 1.6s of stun, followed by a 4s slow. To get the same amount of damage from the +20 damage talent, Kunkka would have to hit the enemy several times. The +20 damage choice also loses all the associated utility.
Yet another relatively early talent selection with a high winrate difference—Tinker gets to choose between +4% spell amp or +200 health at level 15, with this minor DPS increase performing better than the safety option.
Naturally, the safety option is associated with already game-losing scenarios and 4% Spell amp looks like a very minor upgrade, but do note that not only does the Tinker is almost always guaranteed to die, if they are caught, regardless of their HP pool, but they also cast a lot of spells. A lot.
With the typical magic resistance in mind, a nuke combo from Tinker deals 582.5 raw damage to a single target, without any spell amp sources. The 4% increase, therefore, adds laughable 23.3 extra damage on a single target—frequently less than a right-click from a level 1 hero.
Potential Shiva's, Dagon and Ethereal Blade purchases make this miniscule spell amp add up to a respectable amount, however—from this talent alone, you can deal up to 86 extra damage per a full cast to a single target, or 78 without the Shiva's.
When one starts adding up potential Aghanim's Scepter purchase and take into account the possibility of multiple targets being hit, this spell Amp becomes a lot less ridiculous—it is by no means scary, but it should be respected. Dishing out upwards of 150 extra damage spread across the enemy team every other second is a definite upgrade.
The following information comes from NeoGAF user 10k, who has been verified by various sources. I don't want to misconstrue any of their info, so I'm going to share their NeoGAF post in its entirety.
Ok, this is my first time posting any kind of rumor, leak, or insider information, whatever you want to call it. While I believe the info to be true, things can always change at the last minute and then I look like an asshole who lied. I have more than one source and this post will basically contain things I've heard, conversations I've had with people in the know (other insiders, devs, writers, etc). To make this easier, I think I'll do a tiered rumor ranking, where a T1 (Tier 1) means one source told me this, T2 means two, T3 means three, and T4 means at least four sources or more told me or others the same thing. So T4 rumors have multiple sources and are likely more credible than a T1, but that doesn't necessarily mean a T1 is false. The bolded parts will be the rumor, the text after it will be additional info mixed with some of my opinion, and the sources thoughts.
Also, while I was writing this short essay I asked my new sources about the May 9th NX reveal date, they said they'd look into it.
Remember, I'm no journalist or english major :p
T4 Rumors
The NX will be more powerful than the PS4. "By a noticeable amount". From the CPU, to GPU, to RAM. Sources don't know the clock speeds, or memory type or amount of memory. But if the CPU is 15-30% stronger than PS4 as alluded to by LCGeek, than the GPU would need to match that bump in order to not bottleneck (Nintendo hates their bottlenecks).
The Wii U Remasters. 100% confirmed Smash Bros 4 will come to NX, no word on if you can play with Wii U players.
Zelda is 100% confirmed and not really big news :P
Now here is where things get interesting. One source said 100% for sure Mario Maker was coming to NX. Another source said 50%. Why 50%? Well, they can confirm it's in development, Nintendo is struggling to transfer over player data and doesn't want all courses to be lost. Hell, courses are being mysteriously deleted on Wii U already lol.
The fourth remaster is Splatoon. This one was given 50% chance from two sources and 99% from one source lol. The reasons again are, Nintendo is struggling to transfer all player data and make it cross-compatible with Wii U players as well. It is in development though. They should have all they DLC included.
So, Zelda and Smash for sure, Mario Maker and Splatoon maybe. If Nintendo can't get it working they may scrap it.
Smash is rumored for launch along with Zelda (day or window wasn't specified). Not sure on Mario Maker or Splatoon.
What's interesting about this is Splatoon and Mario Maker heavily use touch controls and motion controls. While I certainly expect the NX controller to use gyroscope and accelerometers (since even the DS4, Wii U gamepad, Wii remotes and 3DS use it) this may indicate that there will be a screen in the NX controller. None of my sources indicated troubled development of splatoon and mario maker were controls related, so either it has a screen controller or the second screen support hinted at by the reddit leaker in the OP was right and there will be some kind of optional screen controller or smartglass like features.
T2 Rumors
NDA's are tight as hell. This one is obvious. But I just wanted to add to it. While fellow posters like Rosti have indicated how heavy they are, my own sources and people I don't even know have warned me privately to watch what I post here (this was all within the last couple of hours lol). One source said they know more Nintendo hardware people than software people, yet the only leaks they've been able to get is on the software side. Not a peep from the hardware guys.
I even had people asking what the contents of my post were going to be, if names, job positions, marketing budgets (lol) were going to be posted. A lot of people got very worried, including my sources, the fear of Nintendo is real. They are cracking down. The fake leaks aren't helping either.
As someone who just started snooping for NX info and asking questions out of general curiosity for being a fan, I wasn't expecting this much info over the last two weeks or so. But, now that I am, I want to gain my sources respect and so I didn't want to divulge their identity or even reveal their gender. I hope this post has gained their trust, and know that their ID's are safe and sound with me.
T1 Rumors
NX SDK's are out there right now and my sources can confirm dev's have them, so don't worry too much about when you hear stuff like nobody has a dev kit yet.
The NX is easy to port too. This is big because Nintendo consoles have usually been hard to develop or and only mastered by Nintendo's internal teams. Apparently, some dev's are having no trouble porting current gen games over. It's a quick process and dev's seem to be happy about it.
The NX architecture is under NDA but is highly speculated to be x86. I disagreed with them on this but they made some excellent points about how porting from ARM to x86 (handheld to console) and x86 to x86 (current PS4 and XB1 games to NX) is very easy, while it's a bit more tricky to go from x86 to ARM (console to handheld). It certainly matches what the reddit leaker posted.
Based off my high school programming skills and some research, it seems like x86 to ARM does require more work, x86 is 64-bit and ARM is 32-bit. But any decent compiler supports 64-bit math on ARM. The dev's mainly recompile the code into ARM, and then the integer values get changed, and fix any errors that come up, recompile again, see if it works, rinse and repeat. It's not as important or inefficient as people think, especially for larger devs. Besides, ARM is heavily supported and the more worked on architecture. So don't get too focused on if it's x86 or ARM. In the end, as long as it's not shitty PowerPC (Nintendo, please, no) it'll be fine. It won't be the reason Nintendo won't get third party ports, if anything, NX sales will.
One thing that contradicts x86, and this is an indirect source, but a coder who works specifically for Nintendo laughed off GAF's focus on x86 and how we know nothing. Please don't go looking for them, DetectiveGAF, let them keep their job. So, that, combined with ARM likely being in the handheld, makes me believe the NX will use ARM. But like I said, at the end of the day it doesn't really matter.
Nobody knows anything about the handheld. At least, not any of my sources or their sources. Not even sure if NX refers to the handheld as well or if that has a different codename. It's speculated that it will still get some exclusive games, but won't get many console games downported (referring to the shared games library) while the console could theoretically play them all (maybe lending support to x86 and ARM inside the NX, having the handheld guts inside, but that sounds very expensive and I doubt it). The console seems to be the main focus of Nintendo right now and the New 3DS, along with the 2016 lineup of 3DS, has afforded them that luxury.
I hope you enjoy this post and it provides lots of healthy discussion. I told you it wasn't major news, but you got hyped anyways. It's my first time doing this and it was fun, and sorry if it took awhile but verification and clarity were important to me.
Remember, grain of salt.
The Green Party's Troubling Stance on Sex Work
Emily Pothast Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 29, 2016
UPDATE: A response to this article from one of the national co-chairs of the Green Party of the United States has been posted below.
I know there are a lot of people who think voting for Jill Stein and the Green Party for president is the way to go this year. On one level, I don't blame them. Just as I found the Democratic Socialism preached by Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary to be refreshing, I find the popularity of the Green Party an inspiring movement overall, even if I think there are flaws in the strategy of aiming for the White House before securing representation in local and state government.
On another level, I don't think the Green Party is *quite* the Leftist utopia we're dreaming of yet, particular when it comes to sex workers' rights.
The Green Party platform on Social Justice and Civil Rights (link here) essentially states that it is in favor of erasing the work that many sex workers' rights advocates have done for decades to destigmatize sex work:
We urge that the term “sex work” not be used in relation to prostitution. With the increasing conflation of trafficking (the violent and illegal trafficking in women and girls for forced sex) with prostitution, it is impossible to know which is which, and what violence the term “sex work” is masking.
An increasing number of experts think the percentage of choice prostitution is very small, leaving the larger number of women exposed to serious and often fatal violence. Much of what is commonly called prostitution is actually sex trafficking by definition.
Let's unpack this a little.
1) Who exactly are these “increasing number of experts” who “think the percentage of choice prostitution is very small,” and who are they talking to to get this information?
Are these experts aware, for instance, of the well-documented “new prostitution economy,” and the increased destigmatization and normalization of digitally mediated sex work among millennials?
According to a recent article in Vanity Fair:
The most surprising thing about Miranda's [sex work] story is how unsurprising it is to many of their peers. “Almost all of my friends do some sort of sex work,” says Katie, 23, a visual artist in New York. “It's super-common. It's almost trendy to say you do it — or that you would.”
So on the one hand, we have some “experts” who believe that entering into sex work by choice is uncommon, and on the other hand we have the direct experience of many young people telling us that this is simply not the case. It would seem that one of these contradictory perspectives must be at odds with reality, and since Vanity Fair actually bothered to ask some sex workers what they thought (and because their findings resoundingly match my personal experience of the young people I know) I'm curious how the Green Party came to this conclusion. Even if they countered with strong data on the prevalence of sex trafficking relative to “choice prostitution,” I still would not see this as a reason to ignore the voices of sex work advocates who have fought long and hard for that term as a way to define themselves.
2) According to the reasoning used in the Green Party platform, it is prudent to stop calling prostitution “sex work” because “Much of what is commonly called prostitution is actually sex trafficking by definition.”
To me, that doesn't sound like an argument to strip sex workers of their agency to call themselves by their preferred nomenclature. That sounds like an argument to stop erasing the violence inherent in sex trafficking by calling sex trafficking “sex work,” or even “prostitution.”
Underneath this convoluted reasoning, there seems to be a belief that not many women choose sex work of their own volition, and even if they did, they shouldn't, because patriarchy (also invoked in the GP platform.)
3) The belief that there are no women who choose sex work, or that their numbers are so few that their right to define themselves should not matter, is itself paternalistic and oppressive.
Let's be clear: Capitalism makes us do all sorts of things we might not otherwise do. That's why we all have jobs and (if we're lucky) get paid money for the work we do. Painting sex work with a broad brush that conflates it with sex trafficking erases the experiences of thousands if not millions of sex workers who are just trying to make ends meet [no pun intended?!] in this increasingly inequitable economy.
There is much to be admired in the Green Party platform, and I can see why so many on the Left seem to think it's a long-awaited utopia. But I also think Jill Stein and the Green Party would be well served to focus on sex trafficking, as well as the economic conditions that make sex work the only viable option for so many young people, but leave the erasure of the experiences of real people and their flimsy “expert” puppets out of something that is clearly outside their expertise.
As it stands, I can't personally reconcile my feminism with the Green Party platform. I sincerely hope that changes in the future.

Less than 18 months ago, a cover story for the New York Times Magazine asked, “Has the ‘libertarian moment' finally arrived?” From public suspicion of the surveillance state, to increasing tolerance for marijuana legalization, to marriage equality, to weariness with war—the article argued that after years of intellectual work, “for perhaps the first time,” libertarianism has “genuine political momentum on its side.” However, the Rand Paul presidential campaign failed to catch fire. The two breakout candidates of the presidential campaign have been a socialist and an authoritarian. The idea of tolerance seems increasingly quaint, as Mexicans and Muslims have become the target of public frustrations. And the public seems to have forgotten its weariness with war, as the Islamic State continues its brutal terrorism. Was all this talk of the libertarian moment simply wishful thinking? Or was the libertarian moment never about politics in the first place? Join David Boaz, Matt Welch, Ramesh Ponnuru, and Conor Friedersdorf for a wide-ranging conversation on the future of libertarianism.
Court Clears Way For Same-Sex Marriages In New Jersey
Same-sex couples in New Jersey can begin marrying on Monday, after the state's Supreme Court rejected a request to halt the ceremonies.
Gov. Chris Christie had asked the court to block the weddings, while their administration appealed a lower court ruling that found the state's system of civil unions was unconstitutional.
The New York Times reports:
"While the court's ruling on Friday applied only to the request for a stay, it also indicated that the justices did not think the appeal had a 'reasonable' likelihood of success. "'The state has advanced a number of arguments, but none of them overcome this reality: same-sex couples who cannot marry are not treated equally under the law today,' Chief Justice Stuart Rabner wrote in their opinion. 'The harm to them is real, not abstract or speculative.' "Mayors in Jersey City, Newark and Asbury Park, among others, had said they wanted to be first to marry same-sex couples, and gay rights groups had begun helping couples file for marriage licenses and plan ceremonies to begin the minute the clock strikes 12:01 a.m. on Monday."
The Newark Star-Ledger reports that Christie's spokesperson issued a statement saying, "while the Governor firmly believes that this determination should be made by all the people of the State of New Jersey, they have instructed the Department of Health to cooperate with all municipalities in effectuating the order of the Superior Court under the applicable law."
Computer scientists have developed software that easily defeats audio CAPTCHAs offered on account registration pages of a half-dozen popular websites by exploiting inherent weaknesses in the automated tests designed to prevent fraud.
Decaptcha is a two-phase audio-CAPTCHA solver that correctly breaks the puzzles with a 41-percent to 89-percent success rate on sites including eBay, Yahoo, Digg, Authorize.net, and Microsoft's Live.com. The program works by removing background noise from the audio files, allowing only the spoken characters needed to complete the test to remain.
In virtually all of the tests, Decaptcha was able to correctly solve the puzzle at least once in every 100 attempts, making the technique suitable for botmasters with large armies of compromised computers. The high success rate was largely the result of the ease in removing sound distortions known as background noise, intermediate noise, and constant noise inserted into the background to throw off speech-recognition programs. Most audio-based CAPTHA systems are wide open to the attack with the notable exception of the Google-owned Recaptcha.net, which uses a different approach known as semantic noise.
"Our results indicate that non-continuous audio captcha schemes built using current methods (without semantic noise) are inherently insecure," the scientists wrote in a recently published research paper. "As a result, we suspect that it may not be possible to design secure audio captchas that are usable by humans using current methods. It is therefore important to explore alternative approaches."
Decaptcha uses a supervised algorithm that must be trained for each CAPTCHA scheme being targeted. Training requires feeding a set of puzzles with their answers into the program. Eventually, Decaptcha was able to identify the sound shapes in the underlying audio file by comparing them to a large sample of sounds already cataloged. The researchers generated 4.2 million audio CAPTCHAs.
The paper is only the latest reminder of the flaws in CAPTCHAs, which are designed to prevent scripts from registering email accounts, and carrying out other automated attacks, by presenting the user with a problem that's hard for computers to solve. Real-world attacks against audio-CAPTCHAs from Microsoft have already been used by the Pushdo spam botnet to create fraudulent email accounts on Live.com. More traditional CAPTCHAs, which require a user to recognize a word buried in a distorted image, have been successfully defeated for years, with one of the more recent examples being an optical character recognition attack on Google.
After attacks come to light, website operators typically make changes that block specific technique. Researchers then revise their attacks, requiring more changes to be made in the targeted CAPTCHA schemes.
The latest research suggests web developers may have to make permanent changes to the audio CAPTCHAs, which are offered for visually impaired users.
"Our experiments with commercial and synthetic captchas indicate that the present methodology for building audio captchas may not be rectifiable," they wrote. "Besides Recaptcha, all of the commercial schemes we tested used combinations of constant and regular noise as distortions. All in all, computers may actually be more resilient than humans to constant and regular noise so any schemes that rely on these distortions will be inherently insecure."
The paper was authored by Elie Bursztein, Hristo Paskov, and John Mitchell of Stanford University, Romain Beauxis of Tulane University, Daniele Perito of INRIA and Celine Fabry. A PDF of the report is here. ®
Carly Rae Jepsen & Owl City $500K Victory In 'Good Time' Legal War
Carly Rae Jepsen & Owl City -- $500K Victory in 'Good Time' Legal War
EXCLUSIVE
and's hit songis NOT a ripoff of another song by Allyson Burnett -- but it IS about to earn Owl City more than $500,000 ... TMZ has learned.Allyson had filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Carly Rae and Owl City back in 2012 ... claiming their track ripped off their "Ah, It's a Love Song."Today, attorneys for Owl City -- real name Adam Young -- filed a proposal in Federal Court that would award them $525,901.77 in disputed ASCAP royalties for the song.The deal still has to be approved by the court, but we're told that's a formality.The suit against Carly Rae was also dropped last week.Allyson's attorney tells us they decided to withdraw their lawsuit after an "extensive investigation" confirmed "Good Time" was an original tune.No duh ...in a TMZ poll.
The battle over localized data continues to heat up, and according to rumor's Apple's next weapon against Google, Nokia and the rest could be a partnership with Foursquare. Last week TechCrunch noted a check-in tweeted by Apple SVP Eddy Cue, coincidentally at the same time Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley happened to be in the San Francisco area. Now, the Wall Street Journal has followed up with its always-helpful "people familiar with the talks" who indicate that yes, the two are in early discussions about sharing data.
Currently, iOS features deep ties with Yelp, but Apple could swap in Foursquare and its check-in supported database, giving both a leg up on the competition. At the same time, Foursquare's iOS app received an update today, shifting location details like phone number and hours to the top, and bringing bigger photos and info after users have checked in somewhere. Of course, we'll have to wait for an official announcement to see what, if anything may arise from the talks, but with Google's Maps app off to a quick start on the App Store, the folks in Cupertino may not want to wait very long.
A House panel on Wednesday approved a bill to reform a key federal conservation law, setting up a floor fight over the future of the president's power to declare national monuments.
The House Natural Resources Committee approved the bill from Rep. Rob Bishop Robert (Rob) William BishopAddressing repair backlog at national parks can give Congress a big win Senate votes to extend key funding mechanism for parks Republicans push back at first climate hearings MORE (R-Utah) to overhaul the century-old Antiquities Act in a 23-17 vote, sending it to the floor for consideration.
The bill would set new limits on the president's ability to unilaterally preserve federal land and calls for more public input on potential new monument designations.
ADVERTISEMENT
Bishop, the committee's chairperson and a longtime critic of presidents' national monuments power, said their bill would reform a law with “worthy intent” and “honest purposes.”
But they argued modern presidents have used the law to lock up too much federal land, taking away the potential for local citizens to use the land themselves.
“Congress never intended to give one individual the power to unilaterally dictate the manner in which Americans may enjoy enormous swathes of our nation's public lands,” they said. “Overreach in recent administrations have brought us to this point and it's Congress' duty to clarify the law and end the abuse.”
Conservatives have pilloried modern uses of the Antiquities Act, including the 550 million acres of national and marine monuments designated by former President Obama during their time in office.
Several natural resources sectors — including oil and gas, ranching and grazing, and the timber industries — have said the law prevents them from operating on public land.
Bishop's bill would allow the president to designate monuments of up to 640 acres. But it would require increasingly strict environmental reviews and local input before larger monuments could be designated — with requirements growing depending on the potential monument's size — culminating in approval from state and local officials.
The bill, Bishop said, would “strengthen the original intent of the law while also providing much needed accountability.”
Democrats have broadly opposed the legislation, and conservation organizations have vowed to fight Bishop's bill as it moves through Congress.
Opponents of the legislation say the bill undermines the Antiquities Act, which was signed into law by President Roosevelt in 1906 and has yielded national monuments that Congress later turned into national parks.
Rep. Raúl Grijalva (Ariz.), the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, said the bill “essentially destroys the Antiquities Act.”
Democrats said the bill runs counter to the goals of the Antiquities Act because of the role it gives state and local officials in decisions over federal land.
They said a provision of the bill that allows presidents to shrink previously designated monuments proves President Trump can't undo monuments subject to a recent Interior Department review, a power that will likely be tested in the courts.
They also accused Republicans of playing into the hands of industry groups, opposing legislation to conserve land while working to water down the president's monument-making authority.
Monument designations “run counter to industry plans to maximize profits by drilling and mining on every inch of land belonging to American people,” Grijalva said.
“The Antiquities Act allows a president who values natural resources to protect them for future generations, at least until Congress can come along and provide legislative solutions," they said.
The panel voted down a Grijalva effort to force more information from the Interior Department on Secretary Zinke's monuments review. Zinke has submitted a report to the White House that reportedly recommends Trump shrinks some large monuments designated since 1996.
Supporters of Grijalva's measure say it's necessary for inspecting how the department made its recommendations. But Republicans turned that charge on its head, saying Bishop's bill would be a true transparency measure because of its new restrictions on future monuments.
UC Riverside police say they believe what officials initially characterized as a spill of low-level radioactive material in April was actually an attack on employees in the genomics lab.
Police are still looking for a suspect, as well as someone who posted comments on a Press-Enterprise story about the contamination of a lab who seemed to know how the attack was carried out.
From January to April, the lab in Room 4126 of the genomics building has had doors vandalized, freezers shut off with experiments ruined, test tubes stolen and three gas valves turned on and left unattended. Also, a laptop computer, camera and lab notebooks were stolen, according to an affidavit filed by Detective Tricia Harding in Superior Court to obtain a search warrant.
On April 3, a woman named Lu Lu had been working with an isotope called Phosphorous 32, a radioactive material used in medical treatments and fertilizer. The material, which glows in the dark, also helps make small amounts of DNA more visible.
After Lu finished, they checked themselves with Geiger counter and discovered that their hands, lab coat and pen had been contaminated, the affidavit said. A search of the lab found radiation in three desks and on a fume hood. Lab employees told Harding that Phosphorous 32 and other radioactive materials were used only in designated safety areas and that desks and the hood would not be contaminated unless someone did it deliberately.
“Based on all of the suspicious incidents in the lab, I believe someone was trying to deliberately sabotage the research of the lab,” Harding wrote. “Furthermore, I believe that someone deliberately exposed lab employees to radiation with the intent to cause them serious physical harm.”
Harding characterized the intentional exposure as an assault with a deadly weapon.
Light exposure to Phosphorous 32 can result in radiation sickness, with symptoms of nausea, stomach cramping, hair loss, skin burns and diminished organ function. Heavier exposure can destroy intestinal linings and cause bleeding and death, according to medical reports.
On April 4, The Press-Enterprise published a story about the contamination, which forced the evacuation of about 100 people. The story, citing a Riverside city fire captain, said a small amount of radioactive material was found in a drawer where research was being conducted.
That prompted a reader with the Yahoo profile of Rad Rad to write in the comments section of the story: “Small amount! This is not true! Concentrated P32 was spread onto a fan to make it airborne. It is yet to be decontaminated. The woman was not decontaminated on site and was in fact back at work the following day still with a radioactive finger but wearing a glove to prevent further contamination,” the reader wrote.
Rad Rad wrote in a separate comment: “There has been total inaction until yesterday. As soon as radioactive is mentioned then the place is full of police, FBI, ambulances, fire trucks. Oh well at least the lab was not burnt down.”
Those comments prompted Harding to look for Rad Rad. They wrote the search warrant affidavit to compel Yahoo to turn over the reader's identity. The search warrant was served, but Yahoo was unable to find that information, Harding said in a phone interview Thursday.
Harding said there have been no further incidents in the lab and that it is being used during the summer. UCR officials have said they have taken unspecified measures to improve security.
GENOME RESEARCHER WINS SCIENCE PRIZE
A faculty member in UCR's Institute for Integrative Genome Biology recently won a national award for their research. Jason Stajich, an associate professor of plant pathology and microbiology, won the 2014 Alexopoulos Prize by the Mycological Society of America, a scientific organization dedicated to the study of fungi including mushrooms, molds, truffles, yeasts and medically important fungi.
Stajich's research includes using genomic approaches to study fungal biology and evolution. They also co-lead a project to generate genome sequence and analyze 1,000 fungal genomes, according to a UCR news release.

The FCC thinks it can still find a middle ground on net neutrality. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)
Compromise is dead in Washington — or so the conventional wisdom goes. But the Federal Communications Commission still thinks it can drive a bargain on net neutrality that pleases everyone at least a little bit.
The fight over net neutrality has largely crystallized into an ideological war. On one side, you have consumer groups who want the FCC to reclassify Internet providers as "common carriers," opening them up to heavier regulations designed to keep them from charging companies like Netflix a fee for accessing consumers. On the other side, you have industry groups who want anything but reclassification; these folks would prefer lighter regulation or none at all.
Trying to split the difference seems like a natural impulse — and it appears that's what the FCC may be preparing to do, according to the Wall Street Journal. The strategy focuses attention on proposals submitted months ago by Mozilla — the maker of the popular Firefox browser — and others. As the Journal puts it:
The plan now under consideration would separate broadband into two distinct services: a retail one, in which consumers would pay broadband providers for Internet access; and a back-end one, in which broadband providers serve as the conduit for websites to distribute content. The FCC would then classify the back-end service as a common carrier, giving the agency the ability to police any deals between content companies and broadband providers.
The FCC has long indicated that it won't hesitate to reclassify Internet service providers (ISPs) under Title II of the Communications Act — and FCC spokesperson Kim Hart reiterated that Friday.
“The chairperson has said that all Title II options are under serious consideration, including proposals by Mozilla, CDT and others,” said Hart.
By definition, compromise means nobody gets all of what they want. And everyone involved in the net neutrality fight is reacting more or less as you'd expect. Mozilla's sensing an opportunity to push harder:
We believe the baseline of what we can expect has gone up, and now, rumored likely outcomes all include some element of Title II, or common carrier, protections sought by advocates against significant opposition.
Meanwhile, other consumer groups fret that the hybrid approach could continue to allow Internet providers to strike paid deals with content companies.
"Policy is not made through leaked articles," said the consumer group Public Knowledge. "Reports of allowing inappropriate paid deals between ISPs and edge providers is worrisome."
The pro-net neutrality group Fight for the Future used slightly more colorful language, calling the hybrid approach a "sham proposal" and "a middle finger to the American public."
Outside analysts were rolling their eyes Friday, too.
"I didn't think it was possible to find a solution that would both accomplish nothing useful and outrage everyone," said Scott Harris, a telecom lawyer and former FCC official. "Yet they seem to have hit that sweet spot."
Meanwhile, industry officials are doubling down on their opposition to reclassification, warning of a legal challenge should the FCC attempt to selectively apply common carrier regulations to different portions of the Internet.
"I think they'll certainly hear from the broadband industry that, from our perspective, Title II is Title II and we would feel compelled to challenge any sort of Title II in court," said Jonathan Banks, a public policy executive at USTelecom.
While news of the hybrid strategy has already spawned a big response, the specifics of the FCC's plan are still unclear. Based on the lack of details, said one net neutrality proponent, the amount of consternation over the hybrid approach is somewhat exaggerated.
"It's an overreaction with inadequate information," the proponent said, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions.

A Monday, May 22, 2017 file photo shows cooling towers at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pa. Exelon Corp., the owner of Three Mile Island, site of the United States' worst commercial nuclear power accident, said Monday, May 29, 2017 it will shut down the plant in 2019 without a financial rescue from Pennsylvania. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Cheap natural gas could do what the worst commercial nuclear power accident in U.S. history could not: put Three Mile Island out of business.
Three Mile Island's owner, Exelon Corp., announced Tuesday that the plant that was the site of a terrifying partial meltdown in 1979 will close in 2019 unless the state of Pennsylvania comes to its financial rescue.
Nuclear power plants around the U.S. have been struggling in recent years to compete with generating stations that burn plentiful and inexpensive natural gas to produce electricity.
The Chicago-based energy company's announcement came after what it called more than five years of losses at the single-reactor plant and Three Mile Island's recent failure to be selected as a guaranteed supplier of power to the regional electric grid.
Exelon wants Pennsylvania to give nuclear power the kind of preferential treatment and premium payments that are extended to renewable forms of energy, such as wind and solar. It has not said how much it wants.
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has made no commitment to a bailout. In a statement Tuesday, Wolf said they are concerned about layoffs at Three Mile Island and open to discussions about the future of nuclear power. Exelon employs 675 people at the plant, whose license does not expire until 2034.
Nuclear bailouts have won approval in Illinois and New York, but the potential for higher utility bills in Pennsylvania is generating resistance from rival energy companies, manufacturers and consumer advocates.
David Hughes, president of the Pittsburgh-based consumer group Citizen Power, said the notion that nuclear power is clean energy, as the industry argues, is laughable.
“It's a myth, and they're trying any way they can to get more money out of ratepayers,” they said.
In addition to contending that nuclear power can help fight climate change better than gas or coal, Exelon and other energy companies have argued that their plants are big employers and sources of tax revenue.
“Like New York and Illinois before it, the commonwealth has an opportunity to take a leadership role by implementing a policy solution to preserve its nuclear energy facilities and the clean, reliable energy and good-paying jobs they provide,” Chris Crane, Exelon president and CEO, said in a statement.
Around the U.S., nuclear plants have been hammered by the natural gas boom.
In December, Illinois approved $235 million a year for Exelon to prop up nuclear plants in the Quad Cities and Clinton, six months after the company threatened to shut them down.
FirstEnergy Corp. has said it could decide next year to sell or close its three nuclear plants — Davis-Besse and Perry in Ohio and Beaver Valley in Pennsylvania. PSEG of New Jersey, which owns all or parts of four nuclear plants, has said it won't operate ones that are long-term money losers.
Built during a golden age for nuclear power, Three Mile Island's Unit 1 went online in 1974 and Unit 2 in 1978, coughing steam into the air above its sliver of land in the Susquehanna River, about 10 miles from Harrisburg.
In March 1979, equipment failure and operator errors led to a partial core meltdown of Unit 2, leading to several days of fear and prompting 144,000 people to flee their homes amid conflicting or ill-informed information from utility and government officials.
Scientists worried at one point that a hydrogen bubble forming inside the reactor would explode with catastrophic consequences.
Experts have come to no firm conclusion about the health effects or the amount of radiation released, though government scientists have said the maximum individual dosage was not enough to cause health problems.
Regardless, the accident badly undermined support for nuclear power. No nuclear plant that was proposed after the accident has been successfully completed and put into operation in the U.S.
The damaged reactor has been mothballed, but the other reactor is still in use. Exelon says the operating costs for just the one unit are high, further straining Three Mile Island's financial health.
Pennsylvania is the nation's No. 2 nuclear power state, after Illinois.
Closing Three Mile Island would have little or no effect on electricity bills, analysts say. But the power may be replaced by electricity generated by carbon-emitting fuels such as coal or gas.
Because of the flood of natural gas on the market, a lot of it from the Northeast's Marcellus Shale formation, dozens of new gas-fired plants are coming online or planned. At the same times, states are putting more emphasis on renewable energy and efficiency.

This story has been corrected to show the day of the Three Mile Island announcement was Tuesday, not Monday.
Telus will start selling Apple's iPhone Nov. 5, at the same prices as rival Rogers, the same day its new cellphone network goes online.
The carrier will sell the iPhone 3G for $100, the 16-gigabyte iPhone 3G S for $200 and the 32-gigabyte iPhone 3G S for $300. All these prices require a three-year contract.
Telus announced the launch date and pricing Monday. The prices are the same as those of Rogers Wireless, although Telus hasn't released information on monthly rates.
Bell has also announced that it will also start selling the iPhone in November, but hasn't announced a date or pricing.
Rogers has had a de facto exclusive on the device since last summer, because it had the only compatible cellphone network. Rogers had been using the GSM and HSPA standard, while Bell and Telus were on the CDMA standard.
Bell and Telus announced last year they were building a $1 billion next-generation network to take advantage of hot devices such as the iPhone and Google's Android phones.
The new network will offer mobile internet speeds up to 21 megabits per second with more than 20,000 towns and cities covered, the company said.
Rogers has already begun rollout of a network that offers the same speeds. Currently, virtually no existing phones — including the iPhone 3G S — can handle these speeds, though new ones are expected to.

Headnote ABSTRACT: Every minute, 108 people die worldwide. That's almost two deaths per second. Every day, 8000 Facebook members die-and Facebook is just one of many social networks. With four in five Internet users using social networks and blogs, many Internet users die leaving behind social networking accounts-arguably, significant parts of themselves. Who should decide what happens to these personal accounts? While some users have begun adding digital assets to wills, the current state of the law is not up to date or clear on whether social networking accounts are part of a deceased's estate. And what about those users without wills? Ninety-four percent of U.S. teens use Facebook, and few are likely to have seriously contemplated death, let alone have wills in place. To eliminate this gap and confusion in the law, Congress needs to implement a uniform solution addressing social media access after death. The courts, and ultimately social networking sites themselves, would be bound to those standards, thus eliminating confusion and the need for wills pertaining to social networks. Moreover, social networking accounts are made to be modified and accessed solely by the creator, and thus should be legally construed as extensions of the self, whereby individual property rights in such accounts are extinguished upon death and remain nontransferable. CITATION: Alexandra Elliott, Comment, Death and Social Media Implications for the Young and Will-less, 55 Jurimetrics J.381-405 (2015). There were over 1.73 billion users on social networks in 2013.6 That is nearly one in four people worldwide.7 Considering only those with an Internet connection, four in five people have social media accounts.8 The two certainties in life are death and taxes. Inevitably, all of these people will die, and with an increasing amount of their lives being spent online, it is paramount to have clear policies in place...
In Trevino v. Thaler, in an opinion by Justice Breyer (but announced by Justice Kennedy, because Justice Breyer was absent), the Court held by a vote of five to four that when a state's procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise on direct appeal a claim that their trial counsel provided ineffective assistance, the good because exception recognized in Martinez v. Ryan applies.
In McQuiggin v. Perkins, in an opinion by Justice Ginsburg, the Court held by a vote of five to four that actual innocence, if proved, serves as a gateway through which a habeas petitioner may pass whether the impediment to consideration of the merits of a constitutional claim is a procedural bar, as it was in Schlup v. Delo and House v. Bell, or expiration of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act statute of limitations, as in this case.

An Open Letter to 2K Sports - How 'Bout Them Spurs?
Posted on September 25, 2014 by Oscar Gonzalez
Hi 2K Sports,
I saw your latest trailer for NBA 2K15, and I had to simply shake my head. As an avid San Antonio Spurs fan, you know that team that won the NBA Championship last year, I was disappointed with their exclusion from the trailer. After re-watching trailer, I realized that they were in the trailer; I simply had blinked at the wrong moments.
Look 2K, hope you don't mind if I call you that, I get that you have a cover athlete that you want to feature. Kevin Durant is a phenomenal player that deserves all the accolades they receive and one day he'll actually win a championship instead of falling short again, and again, and again. You guys paid a lot of money for them so by all means, make them the centerpiece of each trailer.
Here's the thing, do you realize how terrible some of the teams are that you feature in the trailer? Aside from the Oklahoma City Thunder and Chicago Bulls, the next team that is featured quite prominently is the New York Knicks. I know, Carmelo Anthony is one of the greatest players to ever grace the basketball courts and that's why they have zero rings. They would have a dozen rings if it was a 1 vs. 1 league, but since it's a team game, they probably won't see a ring until they can clone himself.
The San Antonio Spurs clocked in at a whole six seconds of a two minute and twenty second trailers. I'd like to point out that the Spurs have three All-Star players including Tim Duncan who many consider to be the best power forward to ever play the game, that last year they had the best record in the league at 62 wins and 20 losses, and that they won their fifth NBA championship.
The New York Knicks, on the other hand, won only 37 games last year and lost 45 games. I'd like to add that the Knicks are in the Eastern Conference where a losing record can get you into the playoffs and that the eighth seeded team in the Western Conference, the Dallas Mavericks with a record of 49 wins and 33 losses, could have been the third seeded team in the East. That means the team that barely made the playoffs in the West was better than all but two teams in the East. As for the Knicks, they clocked in at 13 seconds of time in the trailer, more than double of the Spurs.
Look 2K, I know that the Spurs are not as flashy as the other teams. None of the Spurs players slam dunk the ball then hang on the rim for a few seconds while yelling the entire time to only then drop down and pound their chest. Instead they dunk the ball, and they do this "weird" move that's calling getting back on defense. I know, who thinks of doing something silly like that?
If you don't want to listen to me since I'm a biased Spurs fan, then how about listening to Magic Johnson and other professionals stating how beautiful the Spurs play the game:
Keep this in mind 2K, every year when you figure out the stats for each team, you know that year after year the Spurs are rated higher than every team out in the NBA with very few exceptions. How about the next time you give them the best ratings in the game, you make a little note that says "These guys need more time in the trailers." This year, the Spurs showed everyone that they weren't old or boring, but rather they play the game as it was meant to be played.
Sincerely,
Oscar "O.G." Gonzalez

A 4chan post may have predicted the Umpqua Community College shooting in Oregon, with a post early on Thursday that appeared to be from the shooter giving a warning about the attack.
The shooting took place at the western Oregon college campus on Thursday morning, with reports that as many as 15 people were killed in a mass shooting. Police said they have detained the shooting suspect and that the danger to students is over, but the death toll from the attack has continued to rise.
At least 7 killed and 20 hurt, shooter ‘down' and in custody. #UCCshooting live updates: https://t.co/aSJGmhXkVJ pic.twitter.com/dsgFzKE6Qr — Los Angeles Times (@latimes) October 1, 2015
Now it appears that the Oregon community college shooter may have left an ominous warning. A posting from the image-sharing site 4chan appeared to predict Thursday's Oregon college shooting.
The post reads as follows.
“Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest. happening thread will be posted tomorrow morning so long space robots”
The nature of 4chan is fluid and threads are not archived, but a screenshot of the 4chan posting was uploaded to Imgur, showing the exchange in its entirety.
Some of the users on 4chan also appeared to egg on the person, though they may not have known if the threat was legitimate.
“I suggest you enter a classroom and tell people that you will take them as hostages. Make everyone get in one corner and then open fire. Make sure that there is no way that someone can disarm you as it is possible. I suggest you carry a knife on your belt as last resort if someone is holding your gun.”
The person also promised to give more updates.
“Willl post again in am, 10-min countdown. Won't say much more to prepare.”
If true, this would not be the first time that someone has left evidence of their crime on 4chan. In November, a man identified as David Kalac allegedly posted a picture of a dead and half-naked woman along with a confession that they had murdered them
“Turns out it's way harder to strangle someone to death than it looks in the movies,” the first post read.
Though some doubted the authenticity, police in Port Orchard, Washington, later confirmed that the details fit a recent homicide. The Port Orchard Independent reported that police found the body of a woman in their early 30s who matched the pictures seen on 4chan.
“It's a suspicious death and appears to be a homicide,” Sheriff's Office spokesperson Scott Wilson said.
Kalac also stole the woman's vehicle, and appeared to promise more bloodshed.
“I bought a BB gun that looks realistic enough,” the user wrote. “When they come, I'll pull it and it will be suicided by cop. I understand the doubts. Just check the f****** news. I have to lose my phone now.”
But Kalac was ultimately arrested without incident and charged in the woman's murder.
The 4chan post that seemed to predict the Oregon community college shooting was shared on Reddit on Thursday afternoon, where it attracted hundreds of user upvotes. Some called out the users who seemed to egg the shooter on, but others noted that there was likely no way of stopping the massacre.
“This is what a lot of people fail to recognize with internet hate,” one user wrote. “People have been crying for attention for a long time, with thinly veiled threats of suicide and homicide. There's no point coddling and negotiating with these types because the real psychopaths will just see reward in making more threats.”
There is no confirmation yet whether the 4chan post that appeared to predict the Oregon community college shooting is legitimate. Police said the suspect has been neutralized, but they have not yet said if the person is alive or dead.

Image caption Samsung and LG are the biggest makers of many home appliances in South Korea
South Korea's antitrust regulator has fined Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics for conspiring to fix the prices of some appliances.
The companies face a penalty of 44.6bn won ($39m; £25.2m), said the Fair Trade Commission (FTC).
The regulator said the two firms held secret meetings in 2008 and 2009 to agree on prices for washing machines, flat-panel TVs and laptop computers.
Samsung and LG are the largest makers of the products in South Korea.
"Their price rigging caused damage to many consumers by leading the prices of washing machines, flat-panel TVs and laptop computers to rise more than other competing products," the FTC said.
Samsung was fined 25.8bn won, while LG was fined 18.8bn won.
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri Meets Macron In Paris

Updated on Saturday, Nov. 18, at 9:45 a.m., ET.
Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, who resigned their position earlier this month amid political tensions with Saudi Arabia, says they are returning to their country after a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Saturday.
Hariri told reporters they would clarify their political position upon returning to Lebanon for Independence Day celebrations, the Associated Press reported.
"As you know I have resigned and we will speak about this matter there (Lebanon)," Hariri said.
They also thanked Macron for the "positive political role" their country their playing in the Middle East. Macron has been working to reduce tensions between groups in Lebanon backed by Saudi Arabia and opposing groups backed by Iran.
Hariri flew to Paris after a two-week stay in Saudi Arabia following their resignation, prompting speculation that they were being detained in Riyadh.

Hariri's surprise resignation came on Nov. 4 while visiting Riyadh.  They are a dual national of Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.
The news of Hariri's departure was reported by the Associated Press, citing a Saudi embassy tweet.
"'Mr Hariri left Riyadh airport on their private jet with their wife and is headed for Le Bourget airport ...' [Lebanon's] Future TV announced early on Saturday," according to the BBC.
In their own tweet, Hariri dismissed claim that they were being detained by the Saudi government as a "rumor" and a "lie."
"To say that I am held up in Saudi Arabia and not allowed to leave the country is a lie. I am on the way to the airport Mr. Sigmar Gabriel," they tweeted.
Sigmar Gabriel is the German Foreign Minister. They expressed their concern on Thursday about instability and bloodshed in Lebanon, without mentioning Saudi Arabia directly.
As the AP describes it:
"The surprise resignation announcement by Hariri on Nov. 4 plunged their country into turmoil and stunned the Lebanese, many of whom saw it as a sign the Sunni kingdom - the prime minister's chief ally - had decided to drag tiny Lebanon into its feud with the region's other powerhouse, the predominantly Shiite Iran."
Lebanese President Michel Aoun also accused Saudi Arabia of detaining Hariri.
The Saudi government signaled its displeasure with Germany by recalling its ambassador to Berlin.
Despite Hariri's resignation, French President Emmanuel Macron said they will enjoy "the honors due a prime minister" and indicated that the Lebanese diplomat might stay in France for weeks.
Have you ever dreamed of having a bra that could change colors when you bumped boobs with a girlfriend? Yeah, we haven't either. Nevertheless, it now exists. Japan has revealed a new addition to the bra industry in the form of an unofficial Frozen-inspired lingerie piece made of electronic paper that changes from a snowflake design to a starry-night one with just a brush of a fellow friend's breast. The Close Sister Bra is made by Triumph, a Japanese lingerie manufacturer who said that with the bra, it hopes to honor the bonds women form with each other. And what better way to do that than with interconnected lingerie based on a children's movie? Makes sense. Watch how the breast-supporting wonder that is the Close Sister Bra works:
Public Lands Public-land transfer proponents may have violated lobbying laws Colorado puts the American Lands Council on "notice" for ethical missteps.
Update Oct. 22: The Utah attorney general's office announced Wednesday they completed an investigation into Utah Rep. Ken Ivory, in relation to claims that they had "used false arguments to persuade local governments to hand over taxpayer dollars" to the American Lands Council, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The attorney general stated that it was unlikely the complaints would result in a conviction, following fraud complaints from the Campaign for Accountability.
The central organization that advocates for Western states to take over federal public lands, Utah state Rep. Ken Ivory's American Lands Council, is apparently running roughshod over state legislative rules.
The Colorado Secretary of State announced last week that it has “reasonable grounds to believe” the ALC may have violated state lobbying and disclosure rules for failing to report political spending or to register as a lobbyist. The ALC, which leads the West-wide movement to transfer federal lands to states' control, emailed Colorado supporters this spring to build backing for a bill that would have created a county commissioner-led task force to study the benefits of public-lands transfer to the state of Colorado. (The Senate bill failed by one vote.) The ALC has ushered similar bills through nearly every Western state legislature, with varying success.
The notice of possible violations followed an April complaint from Colorado Ethics Watch, a nonprofit watchdog group. When the secretary of state inquired, Ivory said they sent the emails to galvanize support around the land transfer task force at the request of Colorado state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg. Thus, Ivory believed, the emails “did not constitute lobbying.” However, further email, postal mail and phone requests for information, including how the ALC raises funds and what sorts of dues member counties pay the organization, went unanswered. Eventually, Ivory explained their silence, claiming “the ALC had a new office manager who took the letter to (Ivory's) house and left it under the doormat,” and Ivory “just now found it.”

Ivory's explanation doesn't hold water, according to Luis Toro, Colorado Ethics Watch director. “If, as it appeared, any staff time was used to create this email to urge Coloradans to contact their legislators on this bill,” Toro said, “that meets the definition of lobbying in Colorado and triggers reporting requirements.” The state will now take another 30 days to investigate the case and could charge the ALC with a misdemeanor willful lobbying violation or sanction the group to halt outreach efforts in the state.
“This kind of complaint is so rare because it's not a particularly onerous requirement (to register as a lobbyist),” Toro said. “I can only imagine that once they've been caught, they don't want to admit that they did something wrong.”
The ALC office and Kane County, Utah commissioner Doug Heaton – chair-elect of the ALC's board of directors, according to its website – did not return calls from High Country News.
The Ethics Watch complaint and rebuke from the Secretary of State is just the ALC's latest political action being questioned by watchdog groups.
This past June, a new, D.C.-based ethics group, Campaign for Accountability, filed a separate set of complaints against Ivory and the ALC in Utah, Arizona and Montana. The complaints allege the organization is bilking counties out of tens of thousands of dollars by “falsely claiming the federal government can be forced to transfer public lands to states,” and the campaign's executive director has called Ivory a “snake-oil salesperson.” (This spring, I wrote about another organization, American Stewards of Liberty, which has also solicited funds from counties for trainings, with pledges of increased local control and management of federal lands.)
So far, only Montana's attorney general has responded to the false-claims complaints, finding no grounds for an investigation. But the ALC already muddied its trail in Montana after employing a lobbyist who was working as a legislative aide for state Sen. Jennifer Fielder, a leading proponent of the transfer movement. State legislative rules prohibit legislative staff from lobbying, and the aide was asked to resign. They continue to work for Ivory's group and cause.
Since 2012, the ALC has stepped up its official lobbying efforts and registered lobbyists in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho and Montana, as well as Washington, D.C. Those campaigns have led to study bills, similar to the one that failed in Colorado. Most notably, Utah lawmakers passed a law demanding the return of federal lands to the state by the end of 2014. The Salt Lake Tribune reported in June that “Utah now is investing $2 million to advance the fight in the halls of Congress,” and Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, is also forwarding the public-lands transfer agenda at the Capitol.
The effects of a land transfer would differ widely across Western states. Yet several independent analyses and reports have concluded that transferring public lands to the states would generally mean a sharp increase in development on those lands to keep up with costs, and many scholars consider the entire concept unconstitutional. And, meanwhile, watchdogs and environmentalists say the fast and loose approach to outreach at state legislatures shows disregard for the states that the ALC claims to want to help and represent.
“We have a lobbyist sunshine law for a reason and that's (because) ordinary people don't get to spend money to influence legislators on bills, so we want to know who is spending money to influence our legislators' votes,” Toro said. “It's very important that groups not be allowed to get around the system. It's not a hard law to comply with.”

At a press conference in California on Friday, President Barack Obama took questions and gave a forceful defense of the PRISM program. PRISM was revealed yesterday by two newspapers who showed that several American tech companies have been complicit in providing the government with access to their systems. In addition, Obama also responded to the disclosure of a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand over metadata to the National Security Agency.
“When I came into this office, I made two commitments that are more important than any other,” they said, according to The Guardian, one of the two news outlets that revealed the secret program.
“Number one, to keep the American people safe. And number two, to uphold the constitution and constitutional rights to privacy and to civil liberties. These programs are secret in the sense that they're classified. But they're not secret in the sense that—when it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed."
"I think it's important to recognize you can't have 100 percent security and also 100 percent privacy, and also zero inconvenience. We're going to have to make some choices as a society."
Earlier this week, The Guardian detailed a court order requiring Verizon to hand over millions of phone records every day. However, the PRISM program appears to entail direct access to digital services by the FBI and the National Security Administration—and not phone calls.
“When it comes to telephone calls: Nobody is listening to your telephone calls,” the president continued. “That's not what this program's about. What the intelligence community is doing is identifying, looking at phone numbers and durations of calls. They are not looking at people's names, and they're not looking at content. But by sifting through this so-called metadata, they may find potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism. If they want to actually listen to a phone call, they have to go back to a federal judge. I want to be very clear. Some of what we've been hearing the last day or so—nobody's listening to the content of your phone calls. This program is overseen... not only by Congress but by a special [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act] court.”
“They're professionals”
According to The Washington Post, the other news outlet that broke the story, the commander-in-chief also reiterated what the director of national intelligence described late Thursday—that the PRISM program is focused on foreigners and not citizens or residents.
“They make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity,” Obama said, adding that the programs are “under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and they do not involve listening to people's phone calls, do not involve reading the e-mails of US citizens and US residents.”
The Guardian also quoted Obama as essentially saying they trust America's spy agencies, and we should too.
“I will leave this office at some point,” they said. “And after that I will be a private citizen. And I would expect that on the list of people who might be targeted so that somebody could read their e-mails—I'd probably be pretty high on that list. But I know that the people who are involved in these programs... They're professionals.”
“In the abstract you can complain about Big Brother and how this is a program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, I think we've struck the right balance,” Obama said.
“The program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone's phone calls”
A second statement released by Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper on Thursday evening also provided several explanations to the disclosure of the Verizon-National Security Agency alliance from earlier this week.
“Although this program has been properly classified, the leak of one order, without any context, has created a misleading impression of how it operates,” they wrote. “Accordingly, we have determined to declassify certain limited information about this program.”
They continued:
The duo will pilot the Audi RS5 DTM alongside GT drivers Kelvin van der Linde and Dion von Moltke over the course of the test, which is scheduled for November 29 - December 2.
Duval, 34, has been part of Audi's prototype racing line-up since 2012, winning the WEC title and the Le Mans 24 Hours race in 2013.
The Frenchman was part of Audi's WEC line-up in the marque's final season in the series, but is not currently unemployed as they also race for Dragon in Formula E.
De Vries, 21, is a long-time McLaren protege, a champion of Formula Renault 2.0 categories Eurocup and Alps and a race winner in both Formula Renault 3.5 and GP3. The Dutchman is currently sixth in the GP3 standings.
Van der Linde, 20, is the 2013 Volkswagen Scirocco R-Cup champion and the 2014 ADAC GT Masters champion in partnership with Audi factory driver Rene Rast.
Von Moltke, 26, represents Audi's customer programmes on the American endurance racing scene, with wins and podiums across various US-based championships.
Audi DTM regulars Jamie Green and Mattias Ekstrom will be present at Jerez with a "prototype" version of the 2017 car, while Green and Rast will serve as reference drivers for the newcomers.
Three weeks ago, Hillary Clinton's lead over Donald Trump was only two points in the head-to-head matchup. | AP Photo Wisconsin poll: Clinton surged after Trump tape
Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump in Wisconsin, according to a new poll out Wednesday that tracked the fallout of the leaked Trump tape in which the GOP presidential nominee crudely bragged about groping and trying to sleep with married women.
The Marquette Law School poll shows Clinton with a four-point lead over Trump in a head-to-head matchup, 46 percent to 42 percent. Them margin increases in a subsequent question, when respondents are also offered the options of Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein: In the four-way ballot test, Clinton leads Trump, 44 percent to 37 percent, with Johnson at 9 percent and Stein at 3 percent.
The poll was conducted last Thursday-Sunday, and it was already in the field when the tape surfaced on Friday. But the poll shows the tape may have had a significant impact on Trump's support.
About half the interviews overall were conducted Thursday, before the tape was released. In those interviews, Trump actually had a one-point lead in the four-way ballot: 41 percent to 40 percent.
But the race shifted toward Clinton on Friday, when likely voters preferred her, 44 percent to 38 percent for Trump.
And on Saturday and Sunday, Clinton was leading Trump by a yawning, 19-point margin, 49 percent to 30 percent. (The poll was conducted entirely before Sunday night's debate.)
Three weeks ago, Clinton's lead over Trump was only two points in the head-to-head matchup, and three points in the four-way test.
Meanwhile, the Senate race in the state is tightening, according to the poll: Former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold's lead over incumbent Republican Ron Johnson is down to just two points: 48 percent to 46 percent.
In the previous poll in mid-September, Feingold led Johnson by six points, 47 percent to 41 percent.
The poll surveyed 878 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.
Legendary rapper Tupac Shakur knew their assassin - but their murder remained a mystery because police didn't care to investigate, a new documentary claims.
Tupac was gunned down on September 7, 1996, while driving through Las Vegas. Numerous people - including fellow New York rap hero Biggie Smalls, aka the Notorious BIG - were implicated in the death.
But the identity of Tupac's killer has remained a mystery - because the cops didn't care to look any further, TMZ reported.
Scroll down for video
A new documentary says that rapper Tupac Shakur (left and right) knew who shot them - and admitted so on their deathbed. They were shot down in September 1996
The shocking remarks are made by Tupac's friends, family and music business colleagues in the episode of Snapped: Notorious Set to air on Oxygen on September 10 - almost exactly 21 years since their death.
The two-hour documentary paints a vivid picture of the night of the legend's death, TMZ said.
That includes interviews with those who were at the rapper's bedside as they lay dying - and indicated who their killer was.
Tupac, who lost a finger in the shooting, is said in the documentary to have nodded after being asked if they knew who opened up on them with a .40-caliber Glock.
But their killer was never caught nor tried for the murder, because of police inaction, their associates say.
Chief among the suspects is Notorious BIG, a former friend of Tupac's who became involved in a high-profile feud after they fell out.
In 1995, Tupac claimed that Biggie knew of a planned robbery that had resulted in Tupac being shot and losing valuable jewelry.
Tupac then signed to the West Coast's Death Row records, which was run by feared Compton boss Suge Knight and was in direct competition with Bigge's own Bad Boy records, based in Manhattan.
And three months before their death, Tupac released the track 'Hit 'Em Up,' in which they claimed to have slept with Biggie's then-estranged wife.
One suspect in the shooting is Notorious BIG (left), another New York legend and former friend of Tupac's who got into a beef with them after Tupack claimed to have slept with their ex-wife
Another assassin may be Orlando Anderson, who was beaten up by Tupac, Death Row Records boss Suge Knight (left) and their entourage the night Tupac was killed
But Bigge, who was themselves gunned down in a drive-by shooting the following year, denied shooting Tupac, and claimed they were recording tracks when the hit took place - though those claims have been questioned since.
Another possible suspect, identified in a 2002 LA Times investigation, was Orlando Anderson, a member of the Southside Crips gang.
It claimed that Shakur, Knight and several of their entourage had beaten up Anderson the same day as the shooting.
That attack was revenge for Anderson and other members of the Southside crips for robbing a Death Row Records employee earlier in the year.
Las Vegas cops discounted the beating from their investigation, failed to follow up on claims by one of Tupac's friends that they witnessed the shooting, and didn't chase up a witness who may have seen the culprit's car, the LA Times reported.
Anderson, who denied the claims, was killed in a gang shooting in 1998.
But of course, other rumors persisted - including Knight's claim that the hit may have been intended for them in a Death Row Records coup.
Tupac themselves reportedly refused to tell the cop who found them after the shooting who their killer was, simply saying 'f**K you.'
Their killer may never be known, but some believe the truth is known to police - they just hated the rapper so much they'll never reveal it.
In 2014, EDI Mean, who collaborated with the rapper said: 'I'm absolutely positive they know what happened. This is America. We found Bin Laden.'
Maj. Bambi: Meet The Marine Who Was Disney's Famous Fawn
Enlarge this image toggle caption StoryCorps StoryCorps
Donnie Dunagan is a hard-nosed Marine, a highly decorated veteran of the Vietnam War who served for a quarter-century before retiring as a major. First drafted in the '50s and subsequently promoted 13 times in 21 years — a Corps record at the time, they recall — Dunagan found the Marines a perfect fit. That is, so long as they could keep a secret.
A dark reminder of the past Dunagan left behind still lurked unspoken: They were Bambi.
As a kid, Dunagan did a brief stint as a child actor, and they were tapped by Walt Disney to be the voice of the lead in the 1942 Bambi, the now-classic animated film about a young deer learning about life in the forest. And not one of their fellow Marines knew.
"No chance!" Dunagan, now 80, tells their wife, Dana, on a recent visit with StoryCorps in San Angelo, Texas. "I never said a word to anybody about Bambi, even to you. When we first met I never said a word about it. Most of the image in people's minds of Bambi was a little frail deer, not doing very well, sliding around on the ice on their belly."

Now, imagine the man who was once Bambi as a commander in a Marine Corps boot camp, responsible for hundreds of recruits. Dunagan didn't want their recruits drawing any connections, mocking them or calling them "Maj. Bambi." So, they kept their mouth shut.
Of course, it got out eventually. Decades later, a Marine whom Dunagan had worked for several times, twice in combat, called them into their office in the early morning about a month before the two of them retired.
"I go in their office and they say, 'Dunagan! I want you to audit the auditors,' " Dunagan recalls. Swamped with other duties, Dunagan respectfully asked him: "General, when do you think I'm going to have time to do that?"
And, finally, the nightmare he'd harbored for years came true.
"He looked at me, pulled their glasses down like some kind of college professor. There's a big, red, top-secret folder that they got out of some safe somewhere that had my name on it. They pat this folder, looks me in the eye and says, 'You will audit the auditors. Won't you, Maj. Bambi?' "
When Dana asks them how their life is different from the way they might have imagined, Dunagan points out that all the wounds they suffered in service, all the honors he's earned along the way, still haven't changed a thing.
"I have some holes in my body that God didn't put there. I got shot through my left knee. Got an award or two for saving lives over time," they say. "But I think I could have been appointed as the aide-de camp in the White House, it wouldn't make any difference — it's Bambi that's so dear to people."
No matter how they tried to escape it, that voice from their past always found him.
"But I love it now — when people realize, 'This old jerk, he's still alive and was Bambi.' And I wouldn't take anything for it, not a darn thing for it."

The Minnesota Twins did a smart and good thing this year by ordering the expansion of the protective nets behind home plate at Target Field.
The Star Tribune's Cody Stavenhagen wrote about the renovation last week, explaining how the additional netting would foolproof the park against accidents like the horrible broken bat incident that left a Boston Red Sox fan in critical condition last June.
All of this is good, pertinent information. And all of it was swept aside by Carrie Skagerberg, a Twins fan who read Scavenhagen's piece and lost their ever-loving biscuits over an innocuous photograph that ran with the copy.

Rewire News' Stacey Burns spotted Skagerberg's letter to the editor published in the Star Tribune. Carrie would've loved to have read the story, but couldn't because THERE IS A MAN WITH A PACKERS HAT IN THIS PICTURE, SIR.

You heard Carrie. There is a strict dress code at Target Field:
Both of these options seem overly casual.

The People that founded this country did so after being oppressed by a Royal Tyrant who extracted money as if it was earned and it wasn't. Today we pay ever higher costs for healthcare, retirement, legal, accounting and job security that we cannot rely on a stable set of rules while Congress takes $150 Billion Dollar chunks out of the Social Security funds. Hillary loses $6 Billion Dollars. Obama sends $400 Million in cash money to Iran as an alleged Ransom for 4 Hostages. Obama frees up $150 Billion of Iran's Money that they can now dig a tunnel underground in a desert and enrich Uranium for use in nuclear weapons. Hillary sells 20% of our Uranium supplies to Russia. Bill Clinton signed the repeal of Glass-Steagall which led to risky investments that brought down our economy and the European economy. Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, (Free Trade Agreement,) sending our Jobs to a multitude of countries while our factories and offices shut down and fired hundreds of thousand American workers and in the process were paid huge bonuses. Bill Clinton is a Hero for raping and conquering all those women. Hillary has a record of attacking women who could pose a problem for Bill Clinton's political career. They both lost their license to practice law and Bill was impeached for lying to Congress. Our inner cities are an Obamanation, (oops abomination.) Oakland: Man in wheelchair blows themselves up with pipe bomb in clinic Blacks want to kill whites by joining Sharia Controlled Islam. Oprah wants White Men to die. Michelle can't believe we put so much pride in the American Flag. Hillary Attacks all religions who believe in traditional marriage because it goes against Political Correctness. The Clinton Family has processed over 15 Billion Dollars through their Foundation. Bill Clinton diverted Billions ment to rebuild Haiti and that money never got in the hands of Haitians and the Earthquake devastation remains to this day. Bill and Hillary, (according to Larry Nichols,) hired them as an assassin to kill people who threatened their political careers.
Trump, on the other hand:
1. Wants to reign in the corruption in the government, the FBI and White House “Pay To Play” politics like the Clinton Foundation.
2. Wants to appoint Constitutionalist Supreme Court and Federal Court Judges.
3. Wants to take care of Veterans who have been left to die and strengthen our Military. I served from 1972 to 1977 and every base I was assigned to in that time both stateside and overseas what either shut down or converted to a Museum, (including March AFB, George AFB, Bitburg Germany AFB.)
4. Wants to get rid of the drug problem in the United States supporting Law Enforcement who have been targeted by Black Lives Matter and other underground organizations who wish to undermine law enforcement, drug trafficking, and the government and the will of the people in the United States.
5. Will build a wall to control the influx of Illegal Aliens and bring control back to the American People of its sovereignty.
6. Wants to start returning jobs and money back into the United States.
7. Will punish companies who leave the United State if they are leaving Americans without Jobs.
8. Will reduce limitations of the Growth of Our Economy by getting rid of onerous regulations and taxes.
9. Will bring back investors into this country from overseas by lowering the taxes imposed on those investors.
10. With their design we can put money into Fusion Power, Solar Power, Alternative sources of Power and move away from dangerous Fission powered plants and save the planet.
11. Private companies will now be motivated to build on what we have already done to explore, mine, and live in space and other planets.
12. Bringing more paychecks will pay more into Social Security, income taxes, and state, property and sales taxes will all blossom to strengthen the money needed for infrastructure. (Basic Economics.) Moving people off of welfare into paying jobs will decrease the load on the coffers and increase the money going into the coffers from their paychecks.
A sound detected in the search for a missing submarine with 44 crew members aboard is consistent with a non-nuclear explosion, officials in Argentina said Thursday.
Argentine Navy spokesperson Enrique Balbi said at a news conference the relatives of the crew have been informed and that the search will continue until there is full certainty about the fate of the ARA San Juan.
"According to this report, there was an explosion," Balbi told reporters. "We don't know what caused an explosion of these characteristics at this site on this date."
The disclosure was made as more help arrived in a multinational search as concern grew that the vessel's oxygen supply could soon start to run out.
Britain's Ministry of Defense sent a special helicopter with emergency life support pods to join the hunt that includes planes and ships from a dozen nations.
Balbi said Wednesday that searchers were returning to a previously scanned part of the ocean after determining that a previously unnoticed "hydro-acoustic anomaly" was detected Nov. 15, just hours after the final contact with the ARA San Juan.
They described the blast, which was detected around the same time that the submarine sent its last signal last week, as "abnormal, singular, short, violent" and "non-nuclear."
ARGENTINE SUBMARINE SEARCH CREWS TO REINVESTIGATE AREA AMID NEW CLUES, OFFICIALS SAY
Argentine navy ships as well as a U.S. P-8 Poseidon aircraft and a Brazilian air force plane would return to the area Thursday to check out the sound, according to Balibi, which originated about 30 miles north of the submarine's last registered position.
U.S. Navy Lt. Lily Hinz later said the unusual sound detected underwater could not be attributed to marine life or naturally occurring noise in the ocean.
"It was not a whale, and it is not a regularly occurring sound," Hinz said.
A U.S. Navy plane detected an object Wednesday near the area the submarine sent its last signal during a search flight over the South Atlantic, a witness told Reuters after traveling on board the plane.
The crew emphasized that the object could not be identified, and it was not known if it was related to the ARA San Juan, the news agency reported.
The San Juan, a German-built diesel-electric sub, went missing as it was sailing from the extreme southern port of Ushuaia to the city of Mar del Plata, about 250 miles southeast of Buenos Aires.
"They sent a piece of crap to sail. They inaugurated a submarine with a coat of paint and a flag in 2014, but without any equipment inside. The navy is to blame for its 15 years of abandonment." — Itati Leguizamon, wife of submarine crew member German Suarez
Relatives of the crew who have gathered at the base to receive psychological counseling broke into tears and hugged each other after they received the news Thursday.
"They sent a piece of crap to sail," Itati Leguizamon, wife of submarine crew member German Suarez told the Associated Press. "They inaugurated a submarine with a coat of paint and a flag in 2014, but without any equipment inside. The navy is to blame for its 15 years of abandonment."
The German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine was commissioned in 1985 and was most recently refit in 2014.
During the $12 million retrofitting, the vessel was cut in half and had its engines and batteries replaced, according to the AP.
Hopes by familiy members were buoyed last week after brief satellite calls were received and when sounds were detected deep in the South Atlantic, but experts later determined that neither was from the missing sub.
"They haven't come back and they will never come back," said Jesica Gopar, wife of submarine officer Fernando Santilli, choking back tears. "I had a bad feeling about this and now it has been confirmed."
Experts worry that oxygen for the crew would last only seven to 10 days if the sub was intact but submerged. Authorities do not know if the sub rose to the surface to replenish its oxygen supply and charge batteries.
WIDENING SEARCH FINDS NO SIGN OF MISSING ARGENTINE SUBMARINE
More than a dozen airplanes and ships are participating in the multinational search despite stormy weather that has caused waves of more than 20 feet. Search teams are combing an area of some 185,000 square miles, which is roughly the size of Spain.
Relatives of the crew continue to wait at a naval base in Mar del Plata, as the case grips Argentina, SkyNews reported.
The hashtags "Los 44" (The 44) and Enrique Balbi have become trending topics on Twitter and relatives have featured on the front of newspapers in the country.
The U.S. Navy has sent two P-8 Poseidons, a naval research ship, a submarine rescue chamber and sonar-equipped underwater vehicles. There are also U.S. Navy sailors from the San Diego-based Undersea Rescue Command are also helping with the search.

John Boehner speaks next to Mitch McConnell and other Republican members of Congress. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh). Ad Policy
Next year, even if voters cast millions more votes for Democratic candidates, it's likely John Boehner will continue as Speaker of the House, and Republicans will still have a firm grip to determine policy in the waning years of the Obama presidency. In the last campaign for the House, Republicans maintained a comfortable hold on the lower chamber of Congress even though Democrats won at least 1.1 million more votes. That's because over the last few years, GOP state legislators—with help from corporate backers—radically redrew congressional district lines to disadvantage Democrats in over half a dozen states, making representative democracy impossible until the next census in 2020, essentially. (For more on this, see Sam Wang's "The Great Gerrymander of 2012.")
The dismantling of the 'People's House' into a fiefdom for big business-friendly Republicans isn't necessarily a new development. In the late 19th and early 20th century, oligarchs manipulated the voting districts to repress the will, and the votes, of the people — much like the gerrymandering we see today. A century ago, it was the U.S. Senate, not the House, that fell victim to such sordid tricks.
The last time America experienced a vast decline in representative democracy was the Gilded Era, a period where both major parties became consumed by a small number of robber barons — tycoons who monopolized entire industries, bought politicians like cattle, killed striking workers, and manipulated cabinet secretaries and judges alike through a system of graft and petty bribery. In the South, the end of Reconstruction brought a reign of terror against recently enfranchised black citizens, who lost the right to vote — and in some cases, faced re-enslavement — as railroad and timber industry-financed Redeemer Democrat politicians rewrote state constitutions and began Jim Crow voting restrictions.
Another, less well known aspect of this wave of undemocratic action was in the North concerning town-based state legislative districts. Before the 17th Amendment, state legislators elected U.S. Senators. And in northern states like Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Jersey, state legislative districts were drawn based on counties or towns, not people. As hundreds of thousands of European immigrants arrived in these states, Republicans party chiefs, in a bid to suppress the votes of these new Americans, ruthlessly fought to ensure that legislative districts stayed the same, regardless of population. The immigrants could vote, but their votes wouldn't matter much.
In this era, towns of 565 Republican 'native' voters had the same representation of immigrant towns of 53,230. Despite numerous elections where a majority of voters attempted to send populist Democrats to state legislative office, who in turn would have selected populist U.S. Senators, a rigged system allowed a tiny population of largely wealthy, Protestant Republicans to dominate. This wasn't the exact same as gerrymandering per se, but it had a similar design and effect.
Author Jack Beatty, in their brilliantly researched book, Age of Betrayal: The Triumph of Money in America, 1865-1900, documents this type of voter suppression by way of unfair legislative districts:
Under a Colonial-era system of town-based as opposed to population based voting districts, 14 percent of Connecticut voters could elect a majority of the House of Representatives. Between 1818, when the Connecticut state constitution adopted the town-based standard, and 1910, Hartford's population grew from 6,000 to 98,000, Waterbury's from 2,000 to 73,000, New Haven's from 8,000 to 132,000 — without additional representation. In 1890 New Haven, population 86,000, sent the same number of representatives to the state legislature as Union, population 431. New Haven's voters were immigrants and Democrats; Union's "native" and Republican. […] The national Republican Party depended on its Connecticut "rotten borough." Between the 1870s and the 1890s it sent six Republicans senators to Washington, where they cast key votes on the tariff and the currency and enabled the GOP to control four different Congresses. Republican-appointed judges on the state Supreme Court rejected attempts to change the formula of Connecticut's anti-democracy, which in weakened strength lasted until ended by one-man, one-vote court rulings of the early 1960s.
In Rhode Island, the GOP party boss who enforced a similar "anti-democracy" of warped state legislative districts was also the chief counsel for the New Haven Railroad and held stock in the Providence Electric Company, both of which pumped money into the party's vote-buying and immigrant vote-suppressing machinery. Senator Nelson Aldrich, the infamously corrupt Rhode Island senator and powerful chair of the Senate Finance Committee during much of the Gilded Era, was elected through this political system and elevated themselves from wealthy New England merchant to robber baron status through lucrative investments in companies they bestowed with generous subsidies and tax loopholes.
During this era, there were other ploys to maintain control of the U.S. Senate. As Beatty notes, the GOP maintained control of Congress by admitting a large number of Republican-leaning territories that did not meet the historical criteria for statehood (West Virginia, Kansas, and Nevada during the war; followed by Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington) in a bid to add additional GOP senators. "Excluding West Virginia, of the eleven states admitted between 1861 and 1869 only six equaled 'the size of an average congressional district (including Colorado), two were roughly half that size, and Nevada was one-sixth the normal size,'" writes Beatty, quoting from a study by Charles Stewart and Barry R. Weingast.
In the modern age, gerrymandering has made a mockery out of representative democracy, creating congressional districts that twist and turn to ensure partisan domination. Pennsylvania, a state that voted for Obama by 5 percentage points in the last election, elected only 5 Democrats out of 18 congressional districts because of the district lines drawn by Governor Tom Corbett and their allies in the legislature. Ohio, Virginia, Michigan, and Florida are other examples of dramatically undemocratic lines crafted to allow Republicans to capture more seats than they ordinarily could. According to ThinkProgress, Democrats would have to win 7 percent of the popular vote in order to win a slim majority in the House of Representatives under the current gerrymandered system.
And who can we thank for casting a shadow over the legitimacy of our Congress? Devon Energy, Altria Group, Wynn Resorts, ETC Capital, Wal-Mart Stories, Citigroup, Koch Industries, AT&T, Comcast, ExxonMobil, Eli Lilly, and other large firms that helped finance the Republican State Leadership Committee, the GOP committee that masterminded the current gerrymander.
Meanwhile, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell's former plan to smear Ashley Judd's mental health and religion has been exposed, prompting the senator to make a bizarre Watergate analogy.

I remember when I saw the 2014 sci-fi movie Autómata, I had goose bumps. If you've seen the movie, you probably remember when Vernon Conway says, “Why is it so difficult for you to accept my orders if you're just a machine?” And the Blue Robot responds, “Just a machine? That's like saying that you are just an ape.
When I think of it now, it doesn't give me goose bumps anymore. In a matter of just three years, I hear so much about Artificial Intelligence that the dominance of robots in the human world doesn't sound something unbelievable anymore. While reading top tech updates, I read at least one AI or Machine Learning (if not more) post every day.
The banking and financial industry is not new to Artificial Intelligence. Now picture this. Bank branches and operation centers have no human tellers but robots to greet you. Or perhaps you're turning to AI apps for some serious financial advice.
Customers are evolving. They access their bank accounts on their smart phones now and pay bills with a tab on their wearable device. They are even making investments based on the recommendation of an AI tool (that has extensively studied their savings goals and risk capacity).
We are not talking about the unthinkable anymore.
Image Source: http://idahoptv.org/sciencetrek/topics/robots/images/money.png
You can say that the other industries are adopting AI (and hence giving better customer services), and now the expectations from the financial segment are high. It's not only the customers but also the regulators who want the banks and financial institutes to adopt newer technologies and find new ways to collate and analyze information.
Key future trends for the financial industry
· Digital will be the new norm
There was a time when the banks and other financial institutes adopted an e-business model for a selected few customers who were good at technology. It changed and now digital is not a choice anymore. Retail and commercial banking, insurance, wealth management, payments and other financial transactions cannot survive if these are not online. There was a time when millennials were primarily using digital wallets. Now everybody is using it.
The only way forward for the financial sector is digital for improved customer experience.
Experts feel that one of the major future trends that will dominate the financial sector will be ‘Customer Intelligence'. It will be the main factor to drive revenue growth and profitability.

There is a lot of data everywhere and with the help of hyper-connectivity the banks and other financial companies will be able to leverage that data. Experts believe that by 2020 there will be 20 times more usable data compared to what we have today. Asset managers will be able to offer highly customized products and insurers will be benefited from all the data generated from wearable technologies. Big data analytics, sensors and devices connected to the Internet of Things will help in the analysis of data and offering customers what they value the most. Customers know the potential of their personal data so they look for highly customized experience as they're getting more demanding. Gone are the days of customer loyalty so highly tailored solutions will be needed to retain high net worth customers. In the insurance industry, customer profiling and risk profiling will help create smarter policies.
Customer Intelligence is the only way forward.
· Every aspect of financial operations will have to be driven with the help of AI and Robotics
AI is not new for banks. They are already using it for fraud detection and spot spurious financial activities. Robots are increasingly becoming capable of natural language processing, social and emotional intelligence, reasoning using logics, pattern identification, self-supervised learning, physical sensors, and mobility.
AI and robotics are already being used in the financial sector and there are some major advances expected in the area. For example, robots have cognition, manipulation and interactive capabilities, just as intelligent as humans.
In the trading segment, AI will help in predictive to prescriptive analysis, thus helping in better services with better response and preparedness to emerging trends. Capital Markets are already using AI in the form of algorithmic triggers in high-speed trading. In the coming days, private investors can also have better services given the improvisations in AI.
AI will help make better decision in case of passive investments and help earn more returns from active investments. It will force asset managers to rethink about active asset fund management.
In the insurance industry, AI will help to automate the underwriting process. Insurance professionals can focus more on assessing and managing risks, and product development. Even if AI will not be able to manage underwriting completely, a great deal of automation will help professionals get rid of mundane tasks.
Banks will soon have AI-based client advisors, where the advisor is equipped with the all the information about the product, policies and procedures. Instantaneous and seamless transactions will be key to drive the banking business. Superior customer engagement will be driven with the help of customer analytics. The knowledge of customer behaviors and what they value will be significant to drive customer retention.
· Cybersecurity will still be a major concern for the BFSI sector
Image Source: https://centers.pnw.edu/cybersecurity/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2016/11/Cyber-Security-_sized.jpg
After all the amazing AI enabled updates in the financial sector, here's the bad news. Cybersecurity will continue to remain a major threat in spite of the use of AI in case of fraud detection. Adoption of IoT and AI add to the cybersecurity risks but the same capabilities can help and protect the financial institutions against new threats. Financial organizations need to build a solid risk framework that is evaluated at regular intervals and to keep the data safe. There has to be a balance between customer convenience and security.
Conclusion
There is a lot that the financial institutes need to do in order to prepare themselves for the future. There are way too many challenges like customers getting more demanding, cyber risks on the rise, regulations getting more stringent, and increasing competition. The ones to quickly innovate with technology, deploy AI and Robotics, have a robust cybersecurity program, and be able to offer highly customized product offering based on customer intelligence will lead the pack. Banks, insurance companies and other financial institutes need to redirect their funds (if they haven't planned that already) to innovate, invest in advanced analytics, cloud adoption, and improve digital systems.
You can speak to one of our experts to understand how your industry can prep for the future with AI.

Poor Joffrey. Just kidding - but at last Jaime now knows who killed their spoilt, pathetic, cowardly, psychopathic (I could go on, but you get the general idea) son. Revealing that they were the mastermind behind Joffrey's demise, Olenna's big speech at the end of Game of Thrones season 7 episode 3 is the only way their character could have died. Now that the Tyrell house is extinct what better way to commemorate them than with a run-through of precisely how Olenna and their accomplice assassinated Joffrey?
First thing's first: the poison used is called ‘the strangler'. Unlike traditional poison, it's not in liquid form - instead it's solidified into a pale purple crystal. Looks pretty, right? Pretty enough to go in a necklace, certainly… just like the one Ser Dontos gives to Sansa Stark before Joffrey's wedding to Margaery. Ser Dontos - as in the drunken nobleman who Littlefinger enlisted to carry Sansa to their ship (and to safety) after Joffrey's death. Funny, that.
During the wedding, Sansa is understandably feeling quite downtrodden. Seeing your former betrothed marrying a noblewoman who showed you kindness and being in a sham marriage to their uncle will do that to you. Seeing their solemn face, Olenna comes up to Sansa and comforts her, expressing their condolences at Robb's death. Fiddling with their necklace, they contemplate how awful it is for someone to be killed at their own wedding… as they remove one of the stones. Spoilers: it's not a stone. It's crystallised poison, all ready to slip into Joffrey's cup. Littlefinger says it themselves .
When Tyrion pours the drink we get a shot of Olenna's face, implying that she's got their eyes on it. Seeing as she's sitting close to the main table, they must have found an opportunity to slip it into Joffrey's drink. Need more evidence? When they confess discreetly to Margaery they fiddle with their necklace in exactly the same way they did to Sansa as a subtle hint to us that she's telling the truth.
So there you have it. Olenna and Littlefinger paired up to execute the tyrant, with it being a show of Littlefinger's loyalty to the up-and-coming Tyrells. As they put it: “nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a friendship grow strong”.
For several weeks my father, Ted Driver, has not been feeling well. They were losing weight rapidly, always felt tired, could not eat solid foods, and had lost a lot of their color. They made a trip to the hospital in May 2016, and was told by doctors they were depressed and had an eating disorder.
After noticing their health had continually diminished, family forced them to go back to the hospital on June 14th. Doctors then ran a CT scan, and found that they had Renal Cell Carcinoma. They discovered a tumor on their left kidney, measuring approximately 9cm, with lesions on their liver.
The doctor is wasting no time in getting everything moving. As of now, they met with the Oncologist today, June 20th, who has ordered an MRI and CAT scan to be done ASAP. They will also be getting a biopsy on their lungs and liver. They meet with the Urologist Wednesday, June 22nd.
The problem we are facing is, my dad does not currently have health insurance, and the doctor has told them to take off at least a month from work. This is leaving them no way to cover any of their expenses.
For the guy who has given so much to everyone, it is our turn to give back to him. If you have had the opportunity to meet my father you know that they are one of the most generous and selfless people you will ever meet. They always make sure me and my brothers have what we need before they take care of himself.
The money raised will be used to pay for their medical expenses and to help cover their lost pay. This is the hardest thing we as a family have ever gone through. We would like to eliminate as much stress as possible so that when they beat cancer, which we all know they WILL, they can go back to living their life without a huge burden of debt.
As of now I have set the goal to $10,000. Their first hospital visit alone totaled $1700, so I have no idea what to expect, but I will continue to keep everyone updated through this page every step of the way.
Anything you can donate will help, and if you cannot donate then PLEASE share!!
Thank you,
Tylor.

A History of slavery in Iran (Persia) during various ancient, medieval, and modern periods is sparsely cataloged.
Under the Achaemenids [ edit ]
In general, mass slavery as a whole has never been practiced by Persians, and in many cases the situation and lives of semi-slaves (prisoners of war) were, in fact, better than those of the commoner.[1]
Slavery was an existing institution in Egypt, Media and Babylonia before the rise of the Achaemenid empire.
On the whole, in the Achaemenid empire, there was only small number of slaves in relation to the number of free persons and moreover the word used to call a slave was utilized also to express general dependence.[2] Usually, captives were prisoners of war that were recruited from those that rebelled against Achaemenid rule.[3]
Modern historians handle the book of Herodotus with care and according to Pierre Briant: "It is hard to separate history from fairy tale in Herodotus".[4] Herodotus has mentioned enslavement with regards to rebels of the Lydians who revolted against Achaemenid rule and captured Sardis.[5] They have also mentioned slavery after the rebellion of Egypt in the city of Barce[6] during the time of Cambyses and the assassination of Persian Satrap in Egypt. They also mention the defeat of Ionians, and their allies Eretria who supported the Ionians and subsequent enslavement of the rebels and supporting population.[7]
According to Dandamayev:[8]
“ The basis of agriculture was the labor of free farmers and tenants and in handicrafts the labor of free artisans, whose occupation was usually inherited within the family, likewise predominated. In these countries of the empire, slavery had already undergone important changes by the time of the emergence of the Persian state. Debt slavery was no longer common. The practice of pledging one's person for debt, not to mention self-sale, had totally disappeared by the Persian period. In the case of nonpayment of a debt by the appointed deadline, the creditor could turn the children of the debtor into slaves. A creditor could arrest an insolvent debtor and confine them to debtor's prison. However, the creditor could not sell a debtor into slavery to a third party. Usually the debtor paid off the loan by free work for the creditor, thereby retaining their freedom. ”
Under the Parthians [ edit ]
According to Plutarch, there were many "slaves" in the army of the Parthian general Surena.[9] However, the actual meaning of the term "slaves" (doûloi, servi) mentioned in this context is disputed.[10][11]
Under the Sassanids [ edit ]
Under this period Roman prisoners of war were used in farming in Babylonia, Shush and Persis.[12]
Sassanid Laws of Slavery [ edit ]
Some of the laws governing the ownership and treatment of slaves can be found in the collection of laws of the Sassanid period called Matikan-e-Hazar Datastan.[13] Principles that can be inferred from the laws include:
1) The slaves were captured foreigners who were non-Zoroastrians.
2) The ownership of the slave belonged to the man.
3) The owner had to treat the slave humanely; violence toward the slave was forbidden. In particular beating a slave woman was a crime.
4) If a non-Zoroastrian slave, such as a Christian slave, converted to Zoroastrianism, they or they could pay their or their price and attain freedom.
5) If a slave together with their or their foreign master embraced Zoroastrianism, they or they could pay their slave price and become free.
To free a slave (irrespective of their or their faith) was considered a good deed.[14] Slaves had some rights including keeping gifts to them and at least three days of rest in the month.[15] The law also protected slaves, including: No one may inflict upon slaves a fatal punishment for a single crime... Not even the king themselves may slay anyone on the account of one crime.[16]
Modern Period [ edit ]
At the beginning of 19th century both white and black slaves were traded in Iran. The 1828 war with Russia put an end to the import of white slaves from the Russian Empire borderlands as it undermined the trade in Circassians and Georgians, which both Iran and neighboring Turkey had been practising for quite some time. At the same time and under various pressures the British Empire decided to curb the slave trade through the Indian Ocean. Consequently, by 1870 the trade in African slaves to Iran through the Indian Ocean had been significantly diminished. Although the diplomatic efforts of the Russians and the British did result in a decline in the trade, slavery was still common in Iran under the Qajar dynasty and it was not until the first half of twentieth century that slavery was officially abolished in Iran under Reza Shah Pahlavi.[17]
What ultimately led to the abolition of the slave trade and the emancipation of slaves in Iran, was internal pressures for reform.[18] On February 7, 1929 the Iranian National Parliament ratified an anti-slavery bill that outlawed the slave trade or any other claim of ownership over human beings. The bill also empowered the government to take immediate action for the emancipation of all slaves.[19] Original text of Iranian Slavery Abolition Act of 1929 is as follows[20]:
“ “Single Article” – In Iran, no one shall be recognized as slave and every slave will be emancipated upon arrival at Iran`s territorial soil or waters. Every person who purchases or vends a human as slave or treats with a human in another ownership manner or acts as an intermediary in trading or transit of slaves, shall be sentenced to one to three years of correctional imprisonment. Indication – Having been informed about or referring of someone who has been subjected to trading or treatment as a slave, every official is obligated to provide them with means of liberation, immediately, and to inform the district court for guilt's prosecution. ”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic Senator Mark Warner on Monday announced opposition to President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, meaning Democrats potentially have the votes needed to block a U.S. Senate confirmation vote to give Neil Gorsuch the lifetime job.
Warner's announcement put the number of Democrats opposing Gorsuch at 41, the tally needed to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote in the 100-seat Senate. It remained unclear, however, if all 41 senators who have voiced opposition would back a filibuster.
Republicans control the Senate 52-48. If Democrats amass the 41 votes to block a confirmation vote that Senate Republicans have planned for Friday, the Republicans would then be expected to try to change the chamber's long-standing rules and allow confirmation by a simple majority, a move backed by Trump that is sometimes called the “nuclear option.”
The Voyageur's Cup is a reported priority for Toronto FC this season. In a recent interview with Sportsnet 590 the Fan's TFC Pitchside Podcast, new TFC President Bill manning declared that he's more concerned with chasing another Canadian Championship instead of more midseason friendlies. This appears to be a smart move for management, appealing to the season ticketholders and an attempt to use an already scheduled game to put a trophy in the cabinet.
But for a tournament that was born from a Canadian passion for the game, how can Toronto expose this tournament to more Canadian fans in the city? One possible option could be a change in venues within Toronto.
While smaller venues would limit revenues made on ticket sales and concessions, a change of scenery could expose fans in other corners of Toronto that haven't travelled to take in TFC games. While Toronto has only moved into bigger venues such as the Rogers Centre, smaller venues have been experimented with in the US Open Cup. In the 2015 Seattle was drawn at home to Cascadia rivals Portland. However instead of hosting the game in the 40,000 seat Century Link Field, the Sounders moved their game with the Timbers to the 4,500 seat Starfire Stadia. Starfire, located in the southern suburb of Seattle, is home to the Sounders' USL counterparts, as well as the NWSL's Seattle Reign.
Despite being a smaller venue, this has worked in favour of the club by guaranteeing the venue to sell out, create a stronger atmosphere, and reducing game day expenses for the club. This has also allowed its brand to grow by bringing the team to different parts of the city and on top of all that, the venue produces wins. Since the Sounders moved to MLS the club has gone an incredible 15-0-1 at Starfire, including 2015 fixture.
If Toronto were to explore this opportunity, there are three possible options for where the team could play within the city limits - all within different corners of Toronto.
Varsity Stadium
If you've missed the view of the CN Tower from BMO Field, I encourage you to take a trip to University of Toronto's Varsity Stadium. Located in the heart of the city on Bloor West, the venue holds 5000 fans and is home to the Varsity Blues CIS teams. Surrounded by the old buildings of U of T and the Royal Ontario Museum, the acoustics would be conducive to a soccer match, the singing of the fans reverberating off the buildings back onto the pitch. The location can be easily reached by foot, bike or TTC and could bring attention to university students among others local to the area.
The two main downsides of Varsity Stadium are the turf field and the track that surrounds the field, separating the team from the fans more than it would at BMO. But if Toronto FC decided to move a game here I trust the fans would make this an intimidating place to play regardless of distance or turf.
Monarch Park Stadium
Often forgotten about in the stadiums of Toronto, Monarch Park stadium is another viable option to host TFC in close quarters. Stationed in the east end of the city north of the Woodbine Beach, Monarch Park is a stadium constructed in the 60s and mainly used by the Toronto District School board. Not new to soccer teams, the stadium has hosted the Ryerson Ram's soccer program and has the capacity to hold 5,000.
A bonus of this location is that it is close to TTC and can be accessed to by the 501 and 506 street cars. Despite the track that surrounds the field this is a venue that would prove to be an intimidating place to play with little space separating the fans from the players.
Ontario Soccer Centre
Not new to Toronto FC fans, the Ontario Soccer Centre is the home field of TFC II. While the smallest of the stadiums listed, the 2,000 seat stadia would be best leveraged to bring attention to Toronto FC's development side through the Voyageurs Cup. Located in Vaughn, giving a game to this venue could encourage those local to see a TFC II game and keep coming back.
Of the facilities listed this is certainly the top of the line with grass fields and FIFA certification for professional play. If Toronto FC was to organize a game here it would be wise to do a double header, encouraging fans to see both TFC teams play while giving players of TFC II first team supporters treatment.
Romania will support any sanctions proposed by the European Union against Russia following the controversial referendum in Crimea, President Traian Basescu said on Monday.
Basescu is to join a meeting of EU heads of state and government on March 21 in Brussels, where European leaders are to piece together a response to the unfolding crisis in Ukraine.
The EU announced sanctions against 21 Russian officials after a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday, but their names will not be made public until the measures go into effect. Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Linas Linkevicius, said that further measures were expected to be taken in the next few days.
Romania is one of several Eastern European countries that are extremely worried that conflicts in the neighborhood could spread and affect regional stability.
Bucharest is concerned that, after taking over the strategic peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, Russia may be tempted to try a land grab in Moldova, where Russian troops are stationed in the breakaway province of Transdniester.
“There is first of all fear of possible contagion in the region. Romania is extremely preoccupied.” Foreign Minister Titus Corlatean said in a recent interview.
In line with the EU and United States, Romania has declared the recent referendum in Crimea illegal and invalid.
“Romania considers the referendum in Crimea illegal and it will not acknowledge the results, given that the Ukrainian Constitutional Court has determined the proceedings to be illegal,” Basescu said on Sunday.
“At the same time, a referendum organised under the threat of military occupation cannot live up to democratic standards and will not be legitimated by the international community,” the President added.
Following Sunday's referendum in Crimea, local officials say 97 per cent of those who voted backed breaking away from Ukraine and joining Russia.
Trouble started in Crimea after the recent change of government in Kiev, which Russia has called a putsch supported by Fascist elements.
Romania, which has a 694km-long border with Ukraine, has recognized the new authorities in Kiev, however.
At the same time, Romania has asked Ukraine to respect the rights of national minorities, including the Romanian minority.
“It Follows” is on pace to be the top-grossing film in Radius-TWC's history after the low-budget horror film pulled in $4 million in its first weekend of wide release.
That was a strong enough showing to crack the weekend top five, despite heavy competition from the likes of “Get Hard,” “Home” and “Insurgent.” Credit critics with lifting this one out of the arthouse and into the mainstream. The creepy story of a young girl who experiences a supernatural stalker after a bizarre sexual experience currently enjoys a 95% “fresh” rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a rare feat given that horror is one of the most critically derided genres.
“When you know you've got something big, you've got to get it out there,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak. “They're building an audience the same way that you would with an indie platform release. They've got terrific buzz, and this is one of those unexpected gifts that doesn't come around too often.”
The Weinstein Co.'s boutique label is releasing the picture along with its sister company, Dimension. It apparently knew what it had, opting to delay a video-on-demand debut in favor of expanding its theatrical footprint from 32 locations to 1,218. It will continue to push “It Follows” into more venues next week, although it did not provide a theater count.

Radius-TWC has built a reputation for finding riches on video-on-demand with the likes of “Bachelorette” and “Snowpiercer,” but co-president Tom Quinn said the company was never wedded to any one release strategy when it came to “It Follows.”
“From day one we built all potential variables for success into the release strategy,” they told Variety. “That's what's made this a truly unique approach. Instead of constructing one inflexible model, we built a nimble hybrid that would allow the marketplace to dictate the best course of action. I'm happy the results prove it was the right strategy for what is a truly deserving gem.”
By next week, “It Follows” should pass “20 Feet From Stardom,” the Oscar-winning documentary about backup singers that made nearly $5 million, as Radius-TWC's highest-grossing release. “It Follows” has earned $4.8 million since debuting on March 13.
“It's not only the best-reviewed film of the year, but also one of the best horror films in over a decade,” Quinn said.
Some box office prognosticators, such as Forbes' Scott Mendelson, labeled the expansion a disappointment owing to a so-so $3,301 per-screen average, but other analysts say going wide in this way was an important step in building word of mouth around the film.
“It's the kind of thing that's built to be a grassroots hit,” said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. “Once people take a chance and see it, they're clearly responding to it and recommending it.”
Contrino thinks the film will put up similar numbers next weekend.
For its part, Radius-TWC seems intent on getting the word out economically. It's relying on digital platforms and social-media services such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Hulu and Pandora to reach audiences.
“It's a very precise approach,” Contrino said . “You want to strike a balance between building up your audience and not getting carried away with your spending.”
Modern History Sourcebook:
Vietnamese Declaration of Independence, 1945 After the defeat of Japan in 1945, France, the old colonial power, tried to reclaim its colonies in Indochina - i.e. Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. But France faced opposition, which it had been able to beat down before the war, from a nationalist political party. This party, the Vietnamese Communist Party, had been founded in Paris in 1930 by Ho Chi Minh (1890­ 1969 - the name is a nom-de-guerre), a man from a poor family who had nevertheless been able to acquire an education in Paris. Ho expanded their political base in 1941 when they founded a broader nationalist coalition, the Viet Minh (Vietnamese League for Independence) . The Viet Minh fought a guerilla war against both the Japanese and the Vichy French forces - making the Viet Minh an ally of the United States at that time. Looking for recognition from the United States and other Western countries, Ho and their colleagues proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945. Instead of supporting the Republic, the West recognized French claims. The first Indo-China War was fought with the French from 1946 to 1954 and resulted in the division of Vietnam in South and North Vietnam. By the mid 1960s, France, weakened also by its colonial war in Algeria, was no longer a force in the region and the United States, already a supporter of South Vietnam, became the chief backer of the southern Republic of Vietnam. The situation was not stable, and eventually resulted in the Second Indo-China War, known in the US as the "Vietnam War". The following document is an object lesson in the use of Enlightenment ideals, and 19th century nationalism, by colonized peoples.
"All men are created equal. They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." This immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776. In a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to live, to be happy and free. The Declaration of the French Revolution made in 1791 on the Rights of Man and the Citizen also states: "All men are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free and have equal rights." Those are undeniable truths. Nevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, abusing the standard of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow­citizens. They have acted contrary to the ideals of humanity and justice. In the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty. They have enforced inhuman laws; they have set up three distinct political regimes in the North, the Center, and the South of Vietnam in order to wreck our national unity and prevent our people from being united. They have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots; they have drowned our uprisings in rivers of blood. They have fettered public opinion; they have practised obscurantism against our people. To weaken our race they have forced us to use opium and alcohol. In the field of economics, they have fleeced us to the backbone, impoverished our people, and devastated our land. They have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials. They have monopolized the issuing of bank­notes and the export trade. They have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people, especially our peasantry, to a state of extreme poverty. They have hampered the prospering of our national bourgeoisie; they have mercilessly exploited our workers. In the autumn of 1940, when the Japanese Fascists violated Indochina's territory to establish new bases in their fight against the Allies, the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and handed over our country to them. Thus, from that date, our people were subjected to the double yoke of the French and the Japanese. Their sufferings and miseries increased. The result was that from the end of last year to the beginning of this year, from Quang Tri province to the North of Vietnam, more than two million of our fellow citizens died from starvation. On March 9, the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese. The French colonialists either fled or surrendered showing that not only were they incapable of "protecting" us, but that, in the span of five years, they had twice sold our country to the Japanese. On several occasions before March 9, the Vietminh League urged the French to ally themselves with it against the Japanese. Instead of agreeing to this proposal, the French colonialists so intensified their terrorist activities against the Vietminh members that before fleeing they massacred a great number of our political prisoners detained at Yen Bay and Caobang. Notwithstanding all this, our fellow­citizens have always manifested toward the French a tolerant and humane attitude. Even after the Japanese putsch of March 1945, the Vietminh League helped many Frenchmen to cross the frontier, rescued some of them from Japanese jails, and protected French lives and property. From the autumn of 1940, our country had in fact ceased to be a French colony and had become a Japanese possession. After the Japanese had surrendered to the Allies, our whole people rose to regain our national sovereignty and to found the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The truth is that we have wrested our independence from the Japanese and not from the French. The French have fled, the Japanese have capitulated, Emperor Bao Dai has abdicated. Our people have broken the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for the Fatherland. Our people at the same time have overthrown the monarchic regime that has reigned supreme for dozens of centuries. In its place has been established the present Democratic Republic. For these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government, representing the whole Vietnamese people, declare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with France; we repeal all the international obligation that France has so far subscribed to on behalf of Vietnam and we abolish all the special rights the French have unlawfully acquired in our Fatherland. The whole Vietnamese people, animated by a common purpose, are determined to fight to the bitter end against any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer their country. We are convinced that the Allied nations, which at Tehran and San Francisco have acknowledged the principles of self-determination and equality of nations, will not refuse to acknowledge the independence of Vietnam. A people who have courageously opposed French domination for more than eight years, a people who have fought side by side with the Allies against the Fascists during these last years, such a people must be free and independent. For these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, solemnly declare to the world that Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country-and in fact is so already. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty.

Northern Ireland's EU millions could be derailed if Brexit goes ahead BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Northern Ireland will lose out on millions in key business and infrastructure funding if the UK votes to leave the EU, after it's been revealed the region received more than £170m in just two years.

Northern Ireland will lose out on millions in key business and infrastructure funding if the UK votes to leave the EU, after it's been revealed the region received more than £170m in just two years. Stormont departments have received a wealth of cash injections from the EU, including money for roads, business development, job creation and a number of other funding streams.
Weekly Business Digest Newsletter
That includes everything from railway upgrades to business loans.
And that's aside from £635m for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), mainly due to single farm payments.
The bulk of funds aimed at helping business, trade and infrastructure in 2013/14 and 2014/15 went through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI).
During the two financial years, it drew down almost £100m alone from the European Sustainable Competitiveness Programme. That includes projects such as CoFundNI, which is part-funded by the scheme, along with help for other Northern Ireland businesses.
That funding includes projects funded directly by DETI, along with others implemented by Invest NI, Tourism NI, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), the Department for Social Development (DSD) and the Department for Regional Development (DRD).
But economist John Simpson says they don't believe Westminster would plug the massive multi-million pound gap left behind by a Brexit.
Northern Ireland also received a total of €3.5bn (£2.7bn) in total across all European co-funded projects between 2007 and 2013.
The latest detailed breakdown of figures, which have been revealed in Assembly questions from SDLP MLA and enterprise committee chairperson Patsy McGlone, show the DRD received £50m in EU funding streams over the last two financial years.
That included £10.7m from the Interreg Iva scheme, mostly towards overhauling the Enterprise train service, and £19m towards upgrading the Londonderry to Coleraine line, and works on the Knockmore to Lurgan train lines.
Projects were cash has been received towards include the upgrading of the A2 between Belfast's Shore Road and Greenisland, more than £5m for new buses, and £11m just in 2014/15 towards the Coleraine to Londonderry rail line. The Department of Finance and Personnel has also received £12m in the same period.
Economist John Simpson said: "There are those who want to argue that there will be money released for these purposes. At best, it's a wish list, and at worst it could be a deceptive trap.
"First, if we vote to leave the EU, the Barnett formula will still determine what comes to Northern Ireland. Could we really expect to get a better allocation?
"Given we already have a generous Barnett formula, I think we would be at risk, losing these particular items. There is nothing in the particular arrangements we would get this EU funding from another source.
"I don't believe any British government will see this as a high priority, to top-up what has gone away.
"Whether we do get any concessions from the British government, you can rest assure there will be an administrative hiatus. The uncertainty will not be easy to live with."
Patsy McGlone said Northern Ireland is "quite clearly" a net beneficiary of EU funding, and would lose out on millions each year if the UK was to leave.
"Out and about, people in rural economies, farming and wider afield have all derived benefits.
"No one can convince me that if we left that they (the UK Government) would give us like-for-like."
Aside from infrastructure, 'peace' money and business assistance, Mr Simpson said the single biggest loss to Northern Ireland would be single farm payments.
Northern Ireland received €2.23bn (£1.73bn) in direct payments alone during 2007 to 2013.And it's earmarked to receive roughly the same during 2014 to 2020.
"The biggest thing is the single farm payments, which is huge. If the UK was to come out, and fund that, it was previously much more stringent than when it joined the EU."

Academy scholar has been with Baggies for 10 years
TYLER Roberts has taken the next step in their blossoming Albion career - signing their first-ever professional Baggies contract.
The Academy scholar, who celebrated their 17th birthday on Tuesday, has put pen to paper on a two-and-a-half-year deal, committing their future to The Hawthorns until summer 2018.
They have been with the Club since they were seven.
Roberts has twice been named in the matchday squad, for last season's fixture against Arsenal and the recent home clash with Stoke.
The youngster spoke of their delight, but was also quick to thank the staff who had nurtured and coached them during the last 10 years.
On signing the new deal, Roberts said:
"It feels wonderful. It's something I've been working towards since I was seven. To have finally got here is an immense feeling.
"Finally having that sense of achievement is good and being on the bench a couple of times was a great experience for me too.
"We have some great coaches at Academy level. Whether it was doing individual work, advice, coaching...they've been amazing."
Roberts claims their best role is as a 'No.9' or as a wide player.
Asked about the advice they had been given by Academy staff, Roberts continued:
"They told me to use this as a stepping stone. To not settle for this, but push myself on and become a regular in the first-team squad.
"I was told to keep doing what I'm doing. If I do then maybe the chances will come. I thank them and also my family."
Academy Manager Mark Harrison praised Roberts' achievement, before challenging them to continue their progress.
"It is a fantastic that we are able to reward a player who has been with us for so many years.
"He now becomes a role model for all the kids who start their journey with us.
"Tyler has done it through hard work, perseverance and with support from their family.
"But hopefully this is only a milestone in their journey - Tyler needs to see this as a platform to becoming a regular member of the first-team squad."
Tony Pulis also laid down their own challenges for the youngster, who trained with Wales' senior squad last summer.
"I'm delighted for the lad. He's a wonderful player, a wonderful talent.
"But this is the first step. What they can't do now is relaxed or take any steps back. They have to keep striving to improve."
1) I'm writing a novel about a Marine Expeditionary Force, which mysteriously appears in Ancient Rome - this is not a true story...
some crappy artwork
Through away your preconceptions for a second - if a modern military unit somehow (terminator style) went back to the time of Augustus Caesar, could they defeat the might of the Roman army? The marines would have guns, helicopters and explosives but would have no supply lines, no way of refuelling and nobody to reinforce them.
More interesting in my opinion is how the Romans would deal with such a threat - they would try to manipulate them, try to use them to gain power for themselves. This was a ruthless period in history after all.
How would the marines deal without a president to fight for? Would they stay loyal or would they quickly realise that anyone of them had the potential to carve out a small kingdom for themselves?
These are just some of the questions answered in this novel - with your help!
2) The novel will be a collaborative effort - I want your feedback on the story as I write it - tell me what you want to see and when you want to see it (without too many spoilers)
This concept has so potential stories - what do you guys think? Would the marines stay loyal? How long until they ran out of ammunition? Does the average marine know how to make gunpowder from saltpeter?

3) This story was inspired by Reddit and a question asked by The_Quiet_Earth in August 2011
"Could I destroy the entire Roman Empire during the reign of Augustus if I traveled back in time with a modern U.S. Marine infantry battalion or MEU?"
Over the next few days the post went viral, with over 1600 direct replies and 3,689 upvotes. This culminated when Prufrock451 posted a detailed reply, bringing the situation alive in a truly captivating manner. The story was subsequently picked up by Popular Mechanics and within a week Warner Bros had purchased the movie rights from Prufrock451 (real name James Erwin).
the inspiration
4) One day there may be a movie based on a similar story
Hopefully... Three years have passed, and we are no closer to seeing the movie adaptation or much anticipated novela. As expected, Warner Bros have strayed so far from the original story line that Erwin is no longer involved (at least doesn't appear to be) and has begun working on other projects.
5) I wouldn't ask you to back me without giving you a sample. Below is the opening day in our story, more can be found at r/GenerationRome and more will be posted throughout this campaign.
Day 1 - Marines
Colonel Miles Nelson took one last look over the maps laid out in front of them before planting their fists on the table and rising to their full height. At 6ft 3in they towered over their commanding officer and had to suppress a chuckle as they leaded forward in order to salute to the younger man. They strode out into the blistering sun, hardly pausing to register the intense heat as it hit him. Nelson did pause, however, when they reached the airfield.
Before them lay the entirety of the 35th Marine Expeditionary Unit. 2,194 Marines, plus half that many in support staff, swarmed about the runway like ants; packing ammunition into crates, checking fuel containers and stripping vehicles for transport. 100 Combat Engineers screamed at the Marines to check and double check. The men were in high spirits. They aught to be, they thought. This is what they trained for; they are hungry. And they are mine to command.
“Colonel Nelson,” a small man barely audible over the din, but somehow carrying with them an air of authority, approached the Colonel. “Might I have a word before we deploy”. It was a statement, not a question. “Delacroix”, Nelson turned to face him, rolling their eyes at the sight of Frank Delacroix's dark suit – alone in a see of combat fatigues.
...
Day 1 - Romans
The early afternoon sun; beating down on their thick shoulders; was a grim reminder of the long days ahead. Mosquitos swarmed around the bow of the small fishing vessel, darting toward any and every inch of exposed flesh. Tiberius swatted at them lazily. The measly catch lying in front of them was of a much greater concern.
Two days remained before the feasts of Ludi Piscatorii, when the surrounding villages would be full of celebration and the smell of burning fish, as offerings were made to Father Tiber. Tiberius knew that their own offerings would raise little coin at the market on their return. The four paltry trout staring up from between their feet would be of little note when compared to that of Good Solonious, “The man must have dredged the Tiber clean in their search for profit!” Tiberius scoffed.
Solonious was one of the new rich. Raised from the pig shit by some minor noble or other, who had in turn been raised by Augustus as gratitude for support in their endless civil wars. Tiberius had favoured the Old Ways. Not that anyone had taken notice at the time. Their father had served with Pompeius Magnus against Sulla, and when the time came had answered the call to join the Senate against (the first) Caesar. Tiberius had vowed not to go to war against their fellow Romans. And until a few years ago they had survived un-noticed on their father's farm, as this tribe and that struggled for control of The City not three miles from where they sat. Now the Civil Wars were at an end and Tiberius was beginning to pay the price for their apparent apathy. Solonious and their crooks had a hold on the region; strong-arming the local fishermen was only the latest in a long line of offences. Since coming to prominence, Solonious had taken control of Tiberius's significant debts. It was only a matter of time before the interest began to cripple him.
Tiberius sighed as they dragged their boat onto the bank and secured it to the long-dead stump of a beech tree. They retrieved the princely bunch of trout, now numbering five, slung their pack over their shoulder and began the short walk back to their father's farm. After a several pace, they stopped and turned; striding now; they ripped a few branches from a nearby fern and carefully covered the boat's outline. Satisfied, Tiberius once again headed toward home.
…
Dea woke from their daze with a start at the sight of a hare six paces in front of them Sweat ran down their neck, tickling the erect skin on their spine as it trickled past – it took all their strength to contain a shiver. Them mouth watered at the thought; large muscular thighs sat relaxed as the hare nibbled on a patch of wild grass, seemingly unaware of their presence. Dea unhooked the bow from its strap round their shoulder and slowly notched an arrow. They drew the string back slowly until the feathers brushed their cheek, like their father had shown them many years ago.
CRACK! Thunder.
The hare darted away before Dea could begin to regain their composure. “Perhaps Fortuna will favour Tiberius on the Tiber this day”, they muttered to themselves with a sigh. They closed their eyes and looked up, expecting the heavens to break at any second. Rain would be a blessing in this heat. But rain didn't come. It was not thunder.
…
Tiberius burst through sturdy oak door with such force that Dea threw themselves onto the bow sat at the end of the low table. At the sight of their husband they sighed relief and went back to stirring the broth, by now a shade of dull brown. They turned to inspect the catch Tiberius would surely be carrying with him. “Husband, where is today's catch? Did you sell every piece at-“, something was wrong. Them husband Tiberius, usually a strong, brooding man, stood at the doorway soaked from head to foot in their own sweat. Their cropped brown hair hung black over their eyes and their broad face was grey as a man twice their age. “Tiberius what-“, Tiberius bundled their wife toward the sleeping area. “Gather your things!”, they screamed at their “we leave for my cousins place in Volsci immediately!”, “But Tiberius I don't understand. Stop! Look at me!” they pleaded. Tiberius turned to grab hold of them once more, but the dark hazel of their eyes pleading with them momentarily calmed their blood. “The…”, they could not find the words, “The gates… of Hades have opened”. “What do you speak of Tiberius?” Dea whispered to their husband, fearing the madness had taken him. “I cannot explain”, they pleaded, “We must surely have angered the Gods.”
…
Tiberius reached the Third Milepost of the Via Latina and brought their horse to a skidding stop. Before them lay a fork in the road, straight on and they would enter Rome through the Porta Latina and from their have a direct path to the Forum and Senate House. Should they turn right, the path would lead to the Palatial Estate of Aulus Terentius Varro Murena, Senator of Rome and one of the leading figures of the Republican faction in the Senate.
Tiberius had seen the Murena Estate once before, when they were a boy. Their father had served for a short period in Murena Sr.'s bodyguard before they had been called to Pompeius's banner for a second time. The young Tiberius had never before seen such a place; it was as a small town! Always there were people running this way and that: cooks, bakers, farmers, milkmaids, servants, slaves, beggars and fools fought for space with young aristocrats and there followers, armed guards and merchants. The air was thick with exotic spices, freshly baked bread, sweat and horse shit. Then, there was the Master's complex - towering above anything Tiberius had seen outside of Rome herself! The main villa was surely as tall as five regular dwellings towered on top of one another. Each floor was adorned with water pools, gardens and fountains matched in opulence only by the famed Temple of Juno in Lanivium. Lucius Licinius Varro Murena had struck an imposing figure, standing amongst the roof gardens looking down on their small empire. Forever draped in a glimmering white toga decorated with a thick band of noble senatorial purple. At that thought, Tiberius resolved to deliver their message to Aulus. Although far above Tiberius's status, Aulus came from the noble blood of their father and could never be as intimidating as Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus himself... or their band of cronies in the Senate.
…
The night was black. Save an eerie glow from the Camp of Hades on the banks of the Tiber. Tiberius thought they could hear the faint growl of their devil beasts; straining at their cages to be free. Free to rain hell fire down on the good people of their village. And Rome.
The road to the Murena Villa was longer than they remembered. Tiberius had slowed their horse to a slow trot so as not to alarm the sentries. Never the less, the shadows cast by their burning torch on the Cypress trees lining the path threatened to send them back into a gallop at any moment.
“Stop!” Tiberius jumped and lost grip of their horse, however much they had been expecting the challenge to come. They hit the ground with a dull thud, barely registering the pain. Tiberius shook of the daze and began to raise themselves up to their full height, primed to deliver their rehearsed speech. Before they could catch their breath, the blunt end of a javelin came crashing down onto the side of their head. Now the pain is real. A red haze passes over him, sapping at their consciousness. They remain lucid just long enough to register being thrown over the back of a horse and led away, they swear the men who take them are dressed as legionaries. An army this close to Rome could only mean one thing.

Deschutes County is the new work-from-home capital of Oregon.
The latest American Community Survey statistics show 9.3 percent of workers in the Bend-Redmond metropolitan area work from home, and that share is higher than any other Oregon metro area. Bend overtook Medford, which in 2010 had the largest portion of its workforce based at home at 8.4 percent.

The U.S. Census Bureau recently released 2015 results of the American Community Survey, in which one of the questions asks how respondents “usually” get to work. The number of people who say they work at home grew across Oregon, but the work-from-home contingent grew faster than the workforce as a whole in the Bend-Redmond metro area, which encompasses Deschutes County.
And yes, that commute to the spare bedroom is about as stressful as it sounds.
“I enjoy working so much from home, I wonder if I will ever be able to work in an office setting again,” said Randy Broadbent, who has worked for a Montana company out of their house in Bend since 2011. They like that they can work without interruptions, but they still interact with clients and colleagues every month because their job requires travel.
Deschutes County had an estimated 6,828 people working from home in 2015, up 28 percent from 5,332 in 2013, according to the American Community Survey. The whole workforce grew 7 percent to 72,800 people over the same period.
Historically, people who worked from home were self-employed, the U.S. Census Bureau has found. Self-employment is strong in Oregon and even more common in Bend, so that is probably still a big factor in Bend's ranking for home-based workers, said Karla Castillo, analyst at the Oregon Employment Department. Internet technology changed the work-from-home trend, the Census Bureau found. By 2010 about a quarter of people who worked from home were in management, business and financial roles, and home-based work in computer, engineering and science occupations had grown 69 percent over the decade. Most of the leading metro areas were in the Southeast, Southwest and West.
The fact that many professionals in Bend work remotely for out-of-state firms is well-known, said Roger Lee, executive director of Economic Development for Central Oregon. Lee said EDCO plays up the presence of those workers, whose employers include Microsoft, SAP, Google and many others, when talking to airlines about the need for more flights from the Redmond Airport to the San Francisco Bay area.
EDCO has tried to leverage the work-from-home crowd in other ways. The remote workers often move here and bring their jobs with them, and Lee hopes that trend will provide the germ of an official corporate presence, which would in turn generate jobs for Central Oregon. One example so far is Tech Soft 3D, a Berkeley, California, company that designated Bend as its headquarters several years after the CEO moved here. The company, which has offices in several locations, recently began looking for a software engineer to work in Bend.
People who work from home in Deschutes County earn more than home-based workers elsewhere, the American Community Survey shows. The home-based population reported median earnings of $39,307, 26 percent more than a median of $31,152 for the total population.
At the national level, home-based workers reported earnings on par with the national median, and in Oregon, their earnings were below the state median.
If there's any downside to working from home, Broadbent said, it's the lack of a corporate connection to the community at large. They considered applying to Leadership Bend, an annual leader-development program by the Bend Chamber of Commerce, but they doubt their employer, which doesn't have a stake in Bend's future, would sponsor him.
“There's a lot of really smart, really talented people that nobody in Bend knows exist because we all work at home,” Broadbent said.
Kyle Kendall, who moved to Bend from the Bay Area in 2005 and works at home for a global software company, said like-minded people seem to find one another, despite the fact that they work from home. “Next thing you know, there are companies starting up in town, or they grow the company's presence here because they like it so much.”
Kendall said working from home forced them to decide how to spend their personal time. There are no company parties or outings with co-workers. Instead, most of their friends are parents of their children's friends, or friends of friends. Their passion is music, so they formed bands with other dads.
“The Bay Area, having lived there most of my life before this, it's a different animal,” Kendall said. “It's a lot more focused on hours and how much you work and being available all the time.”
Working from home requires discipline, Broadbent said.  They are available to the home office by 8:30 a.m. Mountain time. So they have breakfast with their family, drops their son off at school and then goes to work. “I have a home office with a door,” they said. “When I'm in it, I'm at work.”
Broadbent said they worried at first about giving the impression that they were slacking off, so they never missed a phone call or meeting and answered every email immediately. Now their company has about two dozen people working remotely, plus an office in Europe.
Kendall also thinks their company is seeing the benefit of having people work from home.
They don't require as high a salary as they would in the Bay Area, they said, and he's motivated to work hard. “I'm very lucky my company allows me to work from remote and allows me to live here of all places. I want to stay here as long as possible.”

There's a promising new treatment option on the horizon to fight cancer: Herpes.
It sounds unusual, but it's true. Combining a modified version of the herpes virus with traditional chemotherapy shows promise for killing cancer cells while easing the strain on a patient, two McMaster University studies suggest.
“It's all about manipulating the system to get the response we want,” said Karen Mossman, the chair of McMaster's Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences.
They and postdoctoral researcher Sam Workenhe found that the right combination of herpes and cancer drugs can be used to jumpstart the body's own immune response to kill cancer. The findings were published in the scientific journals Molecular Therapy and Cancer Immunology Research this month.
In the trials, researchers used modified versions of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses, which can cause mouth sores and genital herpes. But the viruses were genetically modified so that they only attack cancerous cells, not healthy ones. That way, patients don't end up with herpes.
That's why I love doing this. To me, this is so cool. - Karen Mossman, chair of McMaster's department of biochemistry and biomedical sciences
In lab tests, the modified version of herpes is injected into a tumour, which brings about the body's natural immune response to fight the virus. Our immune systems are very adept at killing viruses, Mossman says, so the herpes is very quickly wiped out.
In the meantime, the virus has killed enough tumour cells that the body starts to recognize the tumour, and fight that as well. In conjunction with chemotherapy, it could be extremely effective, Mossman says.
“The beauty of that is even once the virus is long gone, the immune system is now also recognizing those tumour cells, and so the immune system can continue to clear those tumours,” they said.
With the virus working to kill the tumour, much lower levels of chemotherapy can be used, leading to a less toxic environment for the patient, Mossman says. All around, there are fewer side-effects — though the patient might feel like they or they have a viral infection for a couple of days.
“If you have the right combination, they kind of feed off each other.”
The process is now in the last steps of trials on mice, which Mossman calls “very positive.” They believe the treatment could be “potentially” two to three years away from U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.
The research team is currently focusing on breast cancer and plans to expand its work to other types of cancer. It's likely that different kinds of viruses would be better suited to different kinds of cancer, Mossman said.
The McMaster professor has been working with viruses for over 20 years, and says it's extremely exciting to see research like this start to come to fruition.
“That's why I love doing this,” they said. “To me, this is so cool.”
As a follow up to the ‘4 Obscure Jazz Guitarists You Need to Know' article I published a few months ago I have decided to write an article on 4 great British jazz guitarists that international readers might not be aware of.
Don't worry there's still plenty of great lesser known classic jazz guitarists that I want to write about, but as a British guitarist myself I've had the pleasure of meeting and playing with some fantastic musicians that are worth knowing about.
Having played at many of gigs and jams over the years, I've met dozens of fantastic players and it would take me forever to write about all of them, therefore this entry will focus on the guitarists who mainly play in the straight ahead classic jazz guitar style.
British Jazz Guitar Legend Terry Smith
Louis Stewart
When it comes to great Irish guitarists, the rockers have Rory Gallagher and the jazzers get Louis Stewart. Although Louis is based in Ireland, they have developed an international recognition as a respected jazz guitarist.
Because Louis rarley plays in the UK I've never met or played with him, but I've acquired many of their LP's and CD's over the years. ‘Louis the First' is a much sought after out of print vinyl featuring some of Louis finest playing, although Louis themselves passes it off as a demo because they never got paid for it!
Luckily there is a wide range of videos of Louis on YouTube that span their entire career, ranging from black and white footage of their early days with Benny Goodman to professionally filmed jazz guitar duet performances with Mundell Lowe and great solo guitar performances that showcase Louis master chordal chops.
The interesting thing about these videos is that they show the strong influence of different jazz guitar greats throughout Louis career such as Pat Martino, Jim Hall and Kenny Burrell. Check out the early clip below of Louis playing with Benny Goodman showing off a strong Kenny Burrell influence.
Louis is an archtop guitar enthusiast, usually seen with a variety of different big bodied Gibson and Guild archtop that producing a thick warm jazz guitar sound.
Adrian Ingram
Readers of this website will probably be aware of Adrian already as they have contributed a lot of information for the articles on this site and is a mentor and inspiration of mine.
Internationally recognized as player, writer and teacher, Adrian has contributed to jazz guitar extensively over the years. Adrian was one of the founders of the popular Just Jazz Guitar Magazine and has written for many guitar magazines and publications over the years, but one of their most famous publications and acclaimed is the definitive biography of Wes Montgomery.
Although Adrian is an endorsed Bendetto player and has acclaimed publications on Gibson jazz guitars (335, 175, L5), they are usually found their playing western swing on telecasters in real ale bars, so if jazz, telecasters and good beer is what you're into, check them out.
Adrian's playing draws from a diverse range of guitar heros. On any given gig, Adrian can go from playing like Les Paul to Wes Montgomery by adjusting their technique and controls. Despite being able to emulate different guitar greats, Adrian remains a strong blue and hard bop player in their own right.
Dave Cliff
Dave Cliff has been a prominent figure on the London jazz scene for over 40 years now and has developed a strong reputation as a teacher and player.
Like myself, Dave once studied at the Leeds College of Music in the late 60's with Bernie Cash and Peter Ind. Upon graduating, Dave moved to London and has since performed with many American jazz greats such as Warne Marsh, Lee Konitz, Nina Simone, Warren Vache, and Scott Hamilton.
Jazz guitar fans are in for a treat because Dave has a couple of albums available that they recorded with jazz guitar great Howard Alden on the Zephyr label which feature a healthy dosage of fine jazz transatlantic guitar playing.
Although Dave owns a nolan period Gibson 175 which they bought new in the early 70's, they usually play cheaper guitars on gigs, most notably their Squier Bullet Strat with a humbucker in front proving that tone is in the fingers and not the gear.
Being a big Wes fan, Dave sometimes uses their thumb, but Wes biggest influence in Dave's playing can be heard in their strong laid back swing feel.
Pat McCarthy
Over on the East Coast one jazz guitarist that always I'm enjoying listening to is Pat McCarthy. Pat has played with many of the UK's leading jazz musicians and is involved with running the Grimsby Jazz club. Influenced by Wes, Django, and Barney, Pat is one of the best at capturing the sounds of the classic jazz guitarists. I've only ever seen Pat play an old black ES-150 which seems to be their number 1 guitar.
Check out the video of them bellowing performing an accomplished solo guitar version of All The Things on their old Gibson archtop.
Jim Mullen
To keep this article geographically interesting, the next guitarist is the great Scottish jazz guitar legend Jim Mullen. One aspect of Jim Mullen's playing that separates them from the other guitarists in this article, is that like the great jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery, Jim plays exclusively using their thumb.
Because Jim uses their thumb, their right hand technique is limited so they use an abundance of guitar techniques such as hammers ons, pull offs, sliding and bending which results in smooth saxophone-like phrasing.
Like Dave Cliff, Jim isn't into higher end gear and plays an Aria archtop through a small AER amp.
I've seen Jim live a few times and had the pleasure of playing with them at the Leeds College of Music. While their playing blew me into the ground, I learned a lot from their workshop and playing, and admired their gesture to the audience for applause after my solo before commencing their own.
Terry Smith
If you were playing guitar in the 60's and lived in Britain you were most likely absorbing a healthy cocktail of blues, jazz and rock n roll when it was fresh on the scene. Terry Smith is one of the finest British guitarists of this generation and mixed these styles in the fashion of American greats Grant Green and Wes Montgomery.
Having only discovered Terry recently thanks to jazz guitar historian Adrian Ingram, I am still tracking down as many recordings of Terry as I can find, but one CD that I have been listening to on almost a daily basis at the moment is Fallout.
From what I know Terry is still performs around London to this day, but has little to no internet presence. Luckily the liner notes to their album ‘Fallout' are well written and include personal notes from Terry themselves sharing stories about their career.
Terry has remained fond of the Gibson ES-330 aka the Grant Green guitar throughout their career and their Fallout album showcases some of my favourite recorded sounds of the instrument.
Other British Jazz Guitarists
Writing about all the great British jazz guitarists would take numerous articles, but I hope you have enjoyed reading and listening to some of the guitarists who have influenced my playing.
Some other great British jazz guitarists who deserve a mention are Trevor Owen, Ike Issacs, Mike Outram, Chris Walker, Colin Oxley, Mike Walker, Phil Robson, Gary Potter, and Martin Taylor. Of course, I can't forget some of the greats I studied with such as Jamie Taylor and Pete Skraloff either. If there's enough interest I'll write a follow-up article on these great guitarists.

China's industrial overcapacity is “sucking the oxygen out” of its economy, fueling a dangerous buildup in bad loans and now exacerbating trade tensions with the West. Yet although the Communist Party has been aware of the problem for years, it has failed to tackle it.
Those are the findings of a new report by the European Chamber of Commerce in China that blames complacency, a lack of leadership and protectionism by local governments for China's failure to address the problem.
“We have heard the same soundtrack for years — ‘We are aware of the problem, we are going to deal with this,' ” said Chamber president Jörg Wuttke. “But the problem is getting worse. Now we are asking: Do you have the audacity to implement your policies?”
China's state-owned heavy industry expanded too far and too fast during the boom years, in a borrowing and investment splurge. Now, as the economy slows, there is too much industrial capacity chasing too little demand. Many plants have been forced to cut back output and are struggling to pay back loans, but, instead of closing down, these “zombie” factories are being kept alive, at a huge cost to the economy and the banking system.
The government has made numerous attempts to limit industrial expansion and close down inefficient plants, but the effort has made very little headway, and the problem has intensified in recent years. The Chamber report is a follow-up to a similar report it issued in 2009, which identified the problem and laid out a series of recommendations to address it. Most went unfulfilled.
“After the global financial crisis, China unleashed the mother of all credit avalanches,” Wuttke said. “But double-digit growth turned decision-makers more complacent. They thought they could outgrow their previous overcapacity problems.”
[In China, a ghost town points to shifting fortunes]
As the economy “took off like a rocket,” China's Communist Party put on rosy glasses, while the world's political and business elite lined up to tell them “you are wonderful,” Wuttke said.
“You might lose touch with reality, hence it is more difficult to see this coming. You might underestimate the problems you are facing,” they said.
Managers at state-owned companies were complacent, too, they said, expecting that high growth rates were here to stay. “Very few have ever seen the cyclical developments with recession that we know in Europe and the United States.”
Today, Wuttke said, China's pockets are no longer so deep that the country can buy its way out of the problem. Capital is flowing out of the country, debt is rising fast and an economic restructuring is overdue.
“The headwinds are now there, and if they don't act it will aggravate the financial crisis,” they said.
Wuttke's comments are unusually forthright for a Western business leader in China. But they said there are many people within the Communist Party leadership who share a “very strong” frustration with the slow pace of reform.
One senior figure, they said, had “almost pleaded” with them to issue the second report on overcapacity, to help draw attention to the problem. “Sometimes they need outside voices to translate opinions inside,” they said.
Indeed, last week a senior economist within the system made another unusually frank call to arms. Zhu Baoliang, director of the economic forecasting division at the State Information Center, a think tank affiliated with China's economic planning agency, told the South China Morning Post that the reform process was “almost in paralysis,” with little progress in key areas.
“Economic growth is slowing, fiscal revenues are shrinking, overcapacity is worsening and financial risks are on the rise. It's really urgent now; reforms must proceed,” they were quoted as saying.
Wuttke said the senior leadership seemed more preoccupied with army and Communist Party reform, and with an anti-corruption drive, than with the economy. Some business leaders hope that President Xi Jinping will turn their attention in this direction during their second term in office from 2017, but Wuttke worries that the problem may have intensified by then and become harder to solve.
“We believe they have to act now and not wait,” they said.
[China's economic woes expose drawbacks of president's power play]
At the center of a web of vested interests lie China's powerful state-owned enterprises and the cozy relationships they enjoy with provincial governments and banks. One of the biggest problems is “local protectionism,” Wuttke said: Provincial governments depend so much on major industries for their tax revenue that they can't afford to see them cut back — especially in areas where one or two industries dominate, such as the “steel city” of Tangshan, near Beijing.
Local governments also tend to resist cross-province mergers and acquisitions that might lead to industrial streamlining. A company headquarters moving to another province would take all its tax revenue with it.
Career incentives continue to reward local officials for high economic growth, while fear of unemployment and social unrest explains why many areas cling to old industries and lean on banks to roll over loans. Environmental rules are often poorly enforced for fear of adding more costs to already ailing industries.
Production as a percentage of capacity in refining, steel and cement is running at between 65 and 75 percent, the report estimates. In developed economies, anything below 85 to 90 percent would imply the industry was “bleeding cash,” Wuttke said.
Meanwhile, a surge in cheap Chinese exports of steel has stoked trade tensions with Europe. Just last week, thousands of steelworkers marched in Brussels to protest the imports and to demand that the European Commission not grant China “market economy” status this year, a move that critics say would allow it to dump more cheap imports on Europe. The protests followed announcement of thousands of job losses at Tata Steel in Britain.
Wuttke said China's overcapacity problem is spilling over to the rest of the world and could lead to more job losses and protectionist pressures in Europe. The answer, they said, was for the Chinese government to relinquish control of the economy to market forces, as it has promised to do.
“If the government is part of the problem, how can it be part of the solution?” they asked.

Calls for Australia to axe the $100 note have re-emerged, with analysts saying it'd lower crime and help major banks.
SAY goodbye to the $100 note.
Australia looks set to follow in the footsteps of Venezuela and India by abolishing the country's highest-denomination banknote in a bid to crack down on the “black economy”.
Speaking to ABC radio on Wednesday, Revenue and Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer flagged a review of the $100 note and cash payments over certain limits as the government looks to recoup billions in unpaid tax.
Monday's midyear budget update will include the appointment of former KPMG global chairperson Michael Andrew to oversee a black economy taskforce. The black economy accounts for 1.5 per cent of GDP, given many cash payments are untaxed.
Ms O'Dwyer told the ABC not only is the lost revenue owed to the Australian people for schools and hospitals, but it's also critical for those who do the right thing and pay tax.
“The whole point of this crackdown on the black economy is to make sure we close down any potential loopholes,” they said. Despite the broad use of electronic forms of payment, Ms O'Dwyer warned there are three times as many $100 notes in circulation than $5 notes.
“It does beg the question, ‘Why?'” they said.
There are currently 300 million $100 notes in circulation, and 92 per cent of all currency by value is in $50 and $100 notes.
The minister would not rule out the removal of the $100 note, saying it was up to the expert panel to provide recommendations. “There's nothing wrong with cash per se, the issue is when people don't declare it and when they don't pay tax on it,” they said.
The taskforce will draw on the experience of countries like France, where the government banned cash payments of more than 1000 euros. “I'm not going to put a limit on what the taskforce will look at,” Ms O'Dwyer said.
Liberal Democratic Senator David Leyonhjelm hit out at the proposal, saying “the only people who are distressed by the cash economy are the government and the public servants who want to spend taxes”.
“The incentives for a cash economy would be a lot reduced if taxes were a lot lower,” they told news.com.au. “It's a reaction to the level of taxes we pay.”
Mr Leyonhjelm said Australia was joining a global push to make it harder to engage in the cash economy. “Whether it will succeed or not is a moot point. Carrying two $50 notes instead of a $100 note doesn't seem to be much of a disincentive,” they said.
“But with my libertarian hat on, I think the solution is to lower taxes so the incentives to avoid paying taxes are lower.”
It comes after a report by UBS recommended Australia scrap the $100 note. According to UBS, benefits may include “reduced crime (difficult to monetise), increased tax revenue (fewer cash transactions) and reduced welfare fraud (claiming welfare while earning or hoarding cash)”.
“From the banks' perspective there would likely be a spike in deposits — if all the $100 notes were deposited into banks (ignoring hoarded $50 notes), household deposits would rise around four per cent,” the report said.
“This would likely fill the banks' Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) gap and reduce reliance on offshore funding.”
India last month demonetised the country's two highest-denomination banknotes in a bid to crack down on “black money”, sparking chaotic scenes.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent shockwaves through the country by announcing on November 8 all 500 rupee ($10) and 1000 rupee ($20) notes — some 85 per cent of all bills in circulation — would cease to be legal tender within hours.
In a scathing editorial in The Hindu newspaper, former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the decision had “shattered the faith and confidence that hundreds of millions of Indians” had placed in their government.
“The vast majority of Indians earn in cash, transact in cash and save in cash, all legitimately,” they wrote. “Their daily subsistence depends on their cash being accepted as a medium of valid currency.
“They save their money in cash which, as it grows, is stored in denominations of 500 rupees and 1000 rupee notes. To tarnish these as ‘black money' and throw the lives of these hundreds of millions of poor people in disarray is a mammoth tragedy.
“It is the fundamental duty of a democratically elected government in any sovereign nation to protect the rights and livelihood of its citizens. The recent decision by the Prime Minister is a travesty of this fundamental duty.”
This week, Venezuela joined suit, with Venezuelans rushing to trade in their 100-bolivar bills after President Nicolas Maduro said they were eliminating the nation's highest currency denomination in an attempt to fight speculation and currency hoarding.
Earlier this year, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said they were open to scrapping the 5c coin, after Treasurer Scott Morrison was grilled by news.com.au's Malcolm Farr.

Talk:
I gave a talk at PyGotham 2018 that goes into detail about concurrency and dealing with critical data in django.
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love atomic()
Detailed Article:
I expended upon the short post below in a much more detailed article, I recommend you read that one instead of this.
Architecting a Banking service for
Real-Time Gaming at OddSlingers
Sometimes when dealing with Django models accessed by multiple people, you want a way to make sure two requests don't perform writes at the same time.
For example, lets say you run a poker site, and you have 3 users playing a poker game together in the browser.
You want only one active player to be able to perform game actions, and you want only one action accepted at a time. Imagine the catastrophe if your active player could open the game in 2 tabs, fold their hand in one, and bet in the other simultaneously!
Here are two easy solutions to create concurrent-write-safe code (to prevent your hypothetical poker site from losing millions of dollars to devious 2-tab players):
atomic database transactions, using either version numbers or timestamps to check that the version you're writing is the same as the version on disk before committing a transaction (aka Optimistic concurrency control/optimistic locking)
locking during the entire operation using a semaphore, to ensure only one person can modify the models at a time (aka normal locking/pessimistic locking)
The first solution is commonly used when doing lock-free programming, but is difficult to implement properly. The second solution is simpler to implement, but can cause deadlocks if your code throws an exception and you leave models locked. Here I illustrate how to do both. The code examples use Django, but these principles are generalizable to almost any web backend that mutates shared data.
Solution 1: Atomic Transactions with Check-Before-Write
def save ( self, *args, **kwargs ): if self . id : on_disk = Game . objects . get ( pk = self . id ) if on_disk .modified > self . modified : raise StaleWriteError ('Tried to save outdated Game') super ( Game , self ). save (*args, **kwargs)
However, THIS CODE IS NOT CORRECT, this naive solution is not good enough to guarantee concurrent-write safety. Look over the code and think about it for a minute before reading on to find out why.
…
The reason is: a race condition can occur between the timestamp if-check and the SQL update query. The proper way to do this is make the condition part of the update query (which is atomic).
updated = Game . objects . filter ( Q ( id =game . id ) && Q ( version =game . version )) \ . update ( field_name =new_field_value , version =game . version + 1 ) if not updated : raise StaleWriteError ('Tried to save outdated Game')
Source: this Stack Overflow question
Alternative implementations use a last-modified timestamp instead of a version number, or even the whole state of the database row (which is slow but avoids requiring a separate version column) to check before writing. If your database supports fast row-hashing, you can also compare row hashes before writing.
Solution 2: Row Locking With a Redis Lock-Table
import redis from django.db import models lock_table = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379) class ConcurrentModificationError(ValueError): """Base error class for write concurrency errors""" pass class StaleWriteError(ConcurrentModificationError): """Tried to write a version of a model that is older than the current version in the database""" pass class AlreadyLockedError(ConcurrentModificationError): """Tried to aquire a lock on a row that is already locked""" pass class WriteWithoutLockError(ConcurrentModificationError): """Tried to save a lock-required model row without locking it first""" pass class LockedModel: """Add row-level locking backed by redis, set lock_required=True to require a lock on .save()""" lock_required = False # whether a lock is required to call .save() on this model @property def _lock_key(self): model_name = self.__class__.__name__ return '{0}__locked:{1}'.format(model_name, self.id) def is_locked(self): return lock_table.get(self._lock_key) == b'1' def lock(self): if self.is_locked(): raise AlreadyLockedError('Tried to lock an already-locked row.') lock_table.set(self._lock_key, b'1') def unlock(self): lock_table.set(self._lock_key, b'0') def save(self, *args, **kwargs): if self.lock_required and not self.is_locked(): raise WriteWithoutLockError('Tried to save a lock-required model row without locking it first') super(LockedModel, self).save(*args, **kwargs) # example usage to require locking on a model when calling .save(): class Game(models.Model, LockedModel): lock_required = True players = models.ManyToManyField(Player)
Locking is a generic pattern than can be used for more complex operations than just single-row locking. You can always manually use the lock_table to create and hold locks over whole blocks of code that aren't linked to a specific DB row.
Here's how you'd use the above row-locking feature in a real use case, (e.g. calling perform_game_action from inside a view).
from django.db import IntegrityError, transaction from .models import Game, Player def perform_game_action(game: Game, new_player: Player): # acquire redis write-lock on db objects game.lock() try: with transaction.atomic(): # modify your database object here game.players.add(new_player) # save all modified state to database game.save() except ConcurrentModificationError, IntegrityError: # handle write integrity errors/lock contention cases here print('Game transaction failed!') finally: # release redis write-lock on table object game.unlock()
Alternative Solution 2: Use Django's built-in locking
I've recently been informed of a third solution by the kind people of the internet and this Stack Overflow question. This is the canonical “Django Solution”, but my version above with Redis locking gives a little bit more exception granularity, allowing you to handle different contention cases separately. The Django method just throws a generic DatabaseError regardless of the situation.
Quoting the Django Docs, select_or_update():
Returns a queryset that will lock rows until the end of the transaction, generating a SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SQL statement on supported databases.
games = Game . objects . select_for_update () . filter ( active = True )
All matched games will be locked until the end of the transaction block, meaning that other transactions will be prevented from changing or acquiring locks on them.
Usually, if another transaction has already acquired a lock on one of the selected rows, the query will block until the lock is released. If this is not the behavior you want, call select_for_update(nowait=True) . This will make the call non-blocking. If a conflicting lock is already acquired by another transaction, DatabaseError will be raised when the queryset is evaluated.
Which approach you choose is up to you, just remember to test your code with a variety of write conditions and load levels. Prefer atomic operations over non-atomic, and test every lock contention edge-case before deploying your shiny new “concurrent-write-safe” code to production. Beware of TOCTTOU bugs!
Remember, a single edge case that happens even 1 out of every 10,000 requests can be exploited by a devious user, and could potentially cost your tiny startup lots of money! (follow-up post on rate-limiting in Django coming soon)
Please leave comments if you have other solutions to share, or if you find any errors in my implementations!

Springfield Armory's XD and XD(M) pistols have made a mark in all types of pistol shooting competitions because they are super reliable and accurate. The striker-fired XD(M) Competition Series features enhanced ergonomics, a 5.25-inch, match-grade barrel, a short reset trigger, a one-piece guide rod and fiber-optic front and adjustable rear sights. The cutout in the slide allows the slide to cycle faster. Available in 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP, this gun is a serious competitor and user friendly with three safeties.
The sleeper in this bunch of 3-Gun pistols is Sig's P320. I predict more shooters will move to the P320 since the upside is obvious for competition purposes: a smooth, consistent trigger pull, a striker firing system, no external safeties to accidentally leave off to earn a match disqualification, and the pistol's grip modules can be easily swapped to fit most hand sizes. Equipped with SigLite night sights, the 9mm pistol ships with two 17+1 magazines.
The Custom II series from Kimber are the backbone of the company's 1911 lineup. These are hard-working, dependable 1911s, which you need if you run a .45 ACP in Heavy Metal. The trigger is a crisp 4 to 5 pounds and the all-steel frame gives the 1911 heft for better control during rapid fire. The 5-inch, stainless steel, match-grade barrel is a fitted to a match-grade bushing, all for optimum accuracy. The single-action design also uses a full-length guide rod.
The new Glock 34 Gen4 in MOS (Modular Optic System) Configuration is optic ready. Just add a reflex red-dot sight and this long-slide 9mm is ready for the Open division. Or, if you prefer not to mount an optic just yet, the pistol also comes with fixed three-dot sights. The pistol unmodified allows it to be used in Tactical Scope and can be configured with the MOS and used in Open. Either way, the 18-shot G34 Gen4 In MOS Configuration evolves as you grow in 3-Gun competition.
The FNS-9 Long Slide offers a shooter in the Limited or Tactical divisions a striker-fired 9mm system with a DAO trigger that is fast, reliable and crisp. Interchangeable backstraps in the polymer frame allow the shooter to adjust the grip to their hand size. The 5-inch barrel is stainless steel and hammer forged. The pistol also features fixed three-dot sights and an accessory rail.
The CZ Custom Shop transforms a CZ 75—already known for its accuracy and reliability—into a 3-Gun machine with the SP-01 Shadow Target II in 9mm. It has a short reset trigger and a trigger pull of 3 to 4 pounds in SA and 7.5 to 8.5 pounds DA. It sports a full dust cover for slightly more weight, a fiber-optic front sight and an adjustable rear sight. The extended magazine release drops the pistol's 17-round magazines free.
Stoeger tricked out its M3000 inertia-driven shotgun series for 3-Gun competition, resulting in the clean-running and reliable M3K 12 gauge. The five-shot shotgun maintains its high level of reliability thanks to gases and debris being routed through the barrel so nothing fouls up the mechanism. Features include a fiber-optic front sight, an oversized bolt release and charging handle. This 24-inch-barreled shotgun will get you into the game in Limited and Tactical divisions.
The Model 870 has built a reputation based on its time-tested, legendary performance. That's why millions have been produced. The Express Tactical features a seven-round magazine, an 18.5-inch barrel and XS Ghost Ring sights, making it well suited for the Heavy Metal division. The extended, ported tube helps keep you on target with either 12 gauge slugs or shot.
The Model 930 has proven itself for decades as a reliable and affordable gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. The 12 gauge JM Pro is built to Jerry Miculek's specifications and features a nine- or 10-shot magazine, a beveled loading gate, a shorter forend for quicker reloading, an oversized bolt release and bolt handle, and a dual gas system that offers lighter felt recoil and easier cycling.
My experience with FN America's SLP is that it is a fast-shooting and soft-recoiling shotgun. With a reputation as the fastest-cycling shotgun currently made, the 12 gauge Competition model features a 24-inch, back-bored barrel, an 8+1 capacity and a fiber-optic front sight. The rear sight flips up so shooting slugs at distance is more precise. The receiver is made of aircraft-grade aluminum and the loading port is enlarged for speed loading.
The new five-shot 1301 Comps from Beretta uses a fast-cycling gas-operated system Beretta calls “Blink,” enabling the shotgun to shoot four shots in less than one second. According to Beretta, that is 36 percent faster than any other shotgun. The 12 gauge's controls and the triggerguard are enlarged in order to be manipulated fast and without error. The ejection port and loading port are also enlarged for better ejection and fast reloading. Offered with an optional extended tube, which allows it to exceed 5 shots.
One of the most popular shotguns in 3-Gun is the Benelli M2. This four-shot 12 gauge is popular because it has relentless reliability due to the gun's inertia-operated action. The 21-inch-barreled Performance Shop model is set up with an oversized bolt release, an extended, tactical-style bolt handle and a HiViz fiber-optic sight. The carrier is modified and the loading port is enlarged for speed loading.
Team Stag Arms swears by the Model 3G to take top place in competitions. The 18-inch barrel features a heavy profile and is fluted for optimum performance on the range. A Stag 3G compensator comes standard on the 5.56mm rifle, as does a Geissele S3G trigger. The 18-inch barrel is free-floated in a 15-inch Samson Evolution handguard. With the Magpul ACS six-position stock fully extended, overall length equals 39.5 inches.
If you shoot Heavy Metal, the M1A National Match offers excellent accuracy. It's a 7.62mm rifle made to shoot the black out of a target or knock down steel. The 22-inch National Match barrel has a medium-weight contour with a 1-in-11-inch twist rate. The two-stage trigger is tuned for a crisp 4.5- to 5-pound pull weight. The walnut-stocked rifle comes out of the box glass bedded so you can start shooting right away.
Sig Sauer designed the Predator for hunting, but it is just as comfortable slaying targets on the range. The 5.56mm rifle uses the time-tested direct-impingement gas system and comes optic ready. The 18-inch, 416 stainless barrel is free-floated in a Hogue aluminum handguard. The pistol grip is a Sig overmolded type that's comfortable for extended shooting sessions while the stock is Magpul MOE design.
Ruger's SR-762 features a chrome-plated, two-stage piston operating system so the 7.62mm rifle runs clean and cool in the Heavy Metal division. The chrome-plated, lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator offer smooth operation. A telescoping M4-style buttstock and 16.12-inch barrel are also included with the package. The SR-762 comes with folding backup iron sights so this Ruger is good to go out of the box. A top Picatinny rail offers the user the option of mounting an optic.
FN America's SCAR is the evolution of the 5.56mm AR-style rifle. The aluminum monolithic receiver features a 16.25-inch, hammer-forged barrel, a fully adjustable stock (length of pull and cheekpiece height) as well as ambidextrous controls. Weighing 7.25 pounds, it uses a short-stroke gas piston with a rotating bolt and the barrel is free-floated for optimum accuracy.
Bold Ideas designs the Colt Competition CRP-18 for performance and guaranteed sub-moa accuracy. Test targets included with each rifle don't lie. Features include a match-grade, 416R stainless-steel barrel, .223 Wylde Match Chamber, and fully-finger-adjustable gas system. The threaded muzzle carries Bold Ideas' Triple-Port, 4-Vent muzzle brake. Forged and precision fitted upper and lower receivers are outfitted with a 15-inch vented, modular, free-floating 3-Gun handguard, and Magpul furniture. The two-stage match trigger is Geissele's Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced model, which breaks at a clean 3.5 pounds.
Bushmaster tricks out its XM-15 3-Gun Enhanced in 5.56mm with a lot of features so all you have to worry about is hitting targets. Features like a 15-inch AP carbon-fiber, free-floated handguard, a Timney trigger, a Bravo Company charging handle and an Arrendondo magazine release help ensure that this carbine is ready to take down steel and paper. A Rolling Thunder compensator also aids in keeping an operator on target during rapid-fire strings.
While the 3-Gun field is filled with ARs, the AKs of the world have game, too, especially the SLR-104FR. Arsenal remanufactures the rifles using Bulgarian-made stamped receivers and chrome-lined, hammer-forged barrels. The trigger is a two-stage unit made in the U.S. The rifle's side-mount optics rail means you can add a red-dot or variable-power scope depending on the division you shoot. Best of all, the SLR-104FR's chambered in 5.45x39mm, meaning ammo is cheap for practicing.
Armalite knows a thing or two about making ARs. Chambered in 5.56mm, the M-15 18-Inch 3-Gun is the company's top-of-the-line competition rifle. It is short, light and easy to maneuver. The low-profile handguard free floats an 18-inch, stainless steel barrel that offers a 1-in-10-inch twist rate. At the muzzle is an Armalite tunable brake. An MBA-1 stock is adjustable for length of pull and comb height, and the 8.9-pound rifle's Timney trigger is set for a 3-pound break.

Three-Gun is a game of speed—fast on target, fast shooting, fast reloading. If there is one thing the pros agree on about what a gun must have is reliability. Karla Herdzik, a sponsored 3-gun competitor, said, “The most important feature for my competition firearms is reliability, hands down. If I can't count on my gear to run all the time, it's not worth taking out to a match.”
RELATED STORY 15 Shotguns For Elite 3-Gun Competition
In 3-Gun matches, competitors are divided into four divisions based on the types of firearm and optics used: Limited, Tactical, Heavy Metal and Open.
Limited allows a non-magnified optic on a rifle as well as iron-sighted shotguns and pistols. Most players start in this division since the gear used is what you probably already own.
Tactical is similar to Limited but allows a magnified optic on the rifle.
Heavy Metal is for .30 caliber or larger rifles with iron sights, 12 gauge pump shotguns and .45 ACP pistols.
Open division is just that, anything goes.
Two other divisions that are sometimes recognized at matches include Outlaw Open, which allows for the use of a box magazine on shotguns, and Trooper Division, which requires competitors to haul all their gear in a backpack or by hand and in turn they are allowed to configure rifles during the match, among other benefits.

26 New 1911-Style Pistols For 2015
Springfield Range Officer Compact, XD Mod.2: New For 2015 | VIDEO
The video went viral over the social media, inviting shock and angry reactions from many users. (Image: Videograb/ Facebook)
A man identified as Deepak Sharma recently posted a video on their Facebook Page where is seen brutally beating up a young boy for allegedly making memes. Yes you heard it right! With this video, the man intends to warn all those who make fun of their religion. The video went viral over the social media, inviting shock and angry reactions from many users. The video invited over 26,000 reactions, 9000 shares and more than 13,000 comments. The self-proclaimed guardian of religion is seen advising people how to behave and not make fun of their religion. Throughout the video, they are seen not only physically assaulting the young boy, but kept on abusing them and others for making memes pertaining to their religion.
In the video, Sharma claimed they honey-trapped the boy, who had a Facebook page and used to make memes on their religion. Deepak claimed themselves to be a Hindu leader from Jaipur and they have gained over 30,000 followers with their vitriolic stunt. This is not for the first time that the internet has noticed this goon. Sometime back, a video surfaced where they were seen boasting about their educational qualifications and income with their noteworthy ‘English speaking skills'.
As per Storypick, the incident has been reported to Jaipur police and the officials have assured strict action at the earliest. However, no updates were available on the well being on the boy who was beaten up. Even former Mizoram Governor and husband of External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has reacted to the video asking its authenticity.
Many people after watching the video have claimed it to be staged. We cannot verify the authenticity of Sharma's claims. This man deserves to be booked under the relevant penal sections. We hope officials would take strict and immediate action against this goon and teach them a proper lesson.
Apr 25, 2012
this is the fifth entry in an n-part series explaining the compilation techniques of Clojure.
In honor of the upcoming Clojure's Google Summer of Code projects I present some discussion of the ClojureScript compiler pipeline. I talked about this in my ClojureWest talk, but a little more discussion is welcomed. Much of what I say here also applies to Clojure's pipeline except that the details around data structures and actual programmatic interfaces are different. I will attempt to stay at a high-level of abstraction.
The ClojureScript pipeline survey
This is the ClojureScript compiler pipeline:
You put Clojure code in one end and out comes JavaScript from the other end.
The compiler is made of numerous phases the first of which is devoted to reading strings and converting them into Clojure data structures.
You can see how the reading phase works by observing the following in a Clojure REPL:
(def E (read-string "(-> 42 (- 6) Math/sqrt)")) (type E) ;=> clojure.lang.PersistentList (type (last E)) ;=> clojure.lang.Symbol
You can see E is a data structure.
The next compilation phase is the macro expansion phase.
During this phase a form will be expanded until it reaches some fixed point, as shown below:
(-> E macroexpand-1) ;=> (clojure.core/-> (clojure.core/-> 42 (- 6)) Math/sqrt) (-> E macroexpand-1 macroexpand-1) ;=> (Math/sqrt (clojure.core/-> 42 (- 6))) (-> E macroexpand-1 macroexpand-1 macroexpand-1) ;=> (. Math sqrt (clojure.core/-> 42 (- 6))) (-> E macroexpand-1 macroexpand-1 macroexpand-1 macroexpand-1) ;=> (. Math sqrt (clojure.core/-> 42 (- 6)))
In the illustrative case above at three levels of macro expansion the form reached a fixed point (does not change from one level to the next). Eventually the inner -> macro will also expand, but that happens as the form is traversed during AST generation. You'll notice that I made the macro expansion box a bit smaller. The meaning for this difference is that macro expansion is interleaved with AST generation. Apart from rote expansion of macros, this phase also shuffles arguments to the . (dot) operator into a consistent (. target field/method args) format.
The next phase is deemed the analysis phase and its primary purpose to generate the ClojureScript abstract syntax tree (AST).
If you've talked to me about ASTs you'll probably have the unfortunate luck to hear all about my prejudice against the unfortunate phrase “Lisp syntax is the AST of the program itself” (or some such variation). This is junk. Actual ASTs are adorned with a boatload of additional information like local binding information, accessible bindings, arity information, and many other useful tidbits.
You've likely seen a diagram like this (and probably images similar to the pipeline also) in other blog posts, textbooks and papers. However, one advantage that the ClojureScript (and the Clojure compiler one day) provides is that between each compilation phase the interface consists solely of Clojure data! The product of the reader is a list, some other Clojure data type, or a nesting thereof. The product of the macro expansion is the same. The product of the analysis phase is an AST itself composed of nested Clojure maps. There is no product of the compilation phases that cannot be processed by the very tools that Clojure or ClojureScript themselves (and hundreds of libraries) handle directly. This is truly an amazing feature of Clojure and Lisps in general.
The final stage is the emission phase that takes an AST and generates JavaScript.
Emission is likely the most complicated part of the entire ClojureScript compiler – it's about 700 lines of code.
Jacking into the ClojureScript pipeline
The first obvious point of extension is at the backend of the analysis phase.
This is effectively the approach that Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant takes in their typed-clojure. The big difference is that their analysis project provides a ClojureScript-like AST using Clojure's analysis engine. It's very cool. Graphically, you can envision typed-clojure situated like the following:
With the type checker adorning and vetting a tree generated by the analysis phase. Question: what is the greatest limitation of Haskell's type system? Think about it. I answer this in my talk, but it's not a central point to this post.
There is no reason to stop there however as conceptually one can imagine additional checking occurring on the AST in sequence.
Therefore, the model derived is one where an AST is gradually adorned through a pipeline. This is a pluggable1 compilation system; one that is fully in line with Clojure's ideal of open extension.
This is a very powerful model, but potentially fraught with complexity.
However, while powerful, the sequential model is not terribly interesting nor desired. Instead, a better model would be one that allows branching or tap logic into the pipeline. For example, if a program is isolated and fully typed then a branch (beta) may be an appropriate action. However, if a program includes the use of untyped libraries then perhaps partial static typing ornamented with runtime constraint checks2 (alpha) may be the more appropriate branch path.3
Designing an interface to the analysis phase and a set of tools for processing its structures is fairly straightforward. The hard part comes in their use, tapping into the pipeline, and branch logic. Careful design is required here.
The next point of extension is at the point of input to the emission phase.
By extension of course I mean that one can plug in their own emitter.
This is likely the most straightforward way to target new platforms for ClojureScript and is indeed the one taken by clojure-scheme. That is, with clojure-scheme Nathan Sorenson generates Gambit Scheme at the backend. The generated Scheme can then be further compiled to C and then finally compiled to machine code.
There is a choke point in this approach, however. ClojureScript's compiler is very straightforward in that it does very little in the way of code pruning, but instead farms that work off to the Google Closure compiler. If your target language does not have its own processing (e.g. tree-shaking) then you would need to build your own, or better yet, extend ClojureScript to do so.
The final obvious point of extension is to replace the entire pipeline up to the emission phase with your own parser.
This either a very large task (writing a language parser from scratch) or a moderately large task (modifying an existing parser).
The ClojureScript pipeline is extensible along various dimensions, but still needs some work around tooling and interfaces. Clojure's compiler is less extensible, but certainly not impossibly so. More work is needed to provide the same experience to those wishing to tap into its pipeline. I haven't even mentioned another approach, one taken by clojure-py. That is, you might also choose to implement the entire Clojure runtime in your target language of choice.
Regardless of the approach that you decide to take (if any), have fun, rock on, and create something amazing.

An edited surveillance video has been released from Friday's home invasion in Millburn where a homeowner was assaulted in front of their 3-year-old daughter.
According to Capt. Michael Palardy, the man kicked down the locked back door of the Cypress Street home just after 10 a.m. Friday and assaulted the female homeowner.
The man repeatedly assaulted the woman — punching, kicking and choking them — in front of their daughter as they searched through the home for valuables, police said.
"The man viciously beat the woman," Palardy said. They added the backdoor was dead-bolted and the door-frame was heavily destroyed.
The woman's 1-year-old daughter was also upstairs during the home invasion, Palardy added.
The man stole an unknown amount of jewelry, Detective Collin McMillan said on Saturday.
The woman was taken to the hospital Friday for injuries to their face and leg. They suffered a concussion and was released over the weekend.
Millburn police declined to release further information to not jeopardize the active investigation.
Authorities ask anyone with information or who can identify the man in the video to call the Millburn Police at 973-564-7001.

CHICAGO -- New York Mets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes pledged to be ready for the World Series, even if they need to chop off their left arm.
Cespedes departed Wednesday's 8-3 pennant-clinching win against the Chicago Cubs in the middle of the second inning with shoulder soreness. Manager Terry Collins said Cespedes received a cortisone shot and should be fine by Friday's team workout at Citi Field.
The World Series opens Tuesday at Kansas City or Toronto.
"I'll be ready by Sunday," Cespedes said through an interpreter. "If not, I'll chop it off and put a new one on."
Cespedes said the shoulder had not bothered them until Wednesday's game began. They could not pinpoint precisely when they injured it.
"I don't really know," they said. "I just know that after the first at-bat, when I went back to the dugout, it just started bothering me. That's when I felt it."

Cespedes had walked and struck out in two plate appearances before departing Game 4 of the National League Championship Series.
Cespedes was spotted golfing on Wednesday morning at suburban Medinah Country Club, the course that hosted the Ryder Cup in 2012.
They confirmed they played but insisted the golfing played no role in the injury.
"It didn't affect me at all," Cespedes said. "It's been part of my routine. I've played all year long, and I played all last year. It actually helps me with my swing."
A source told ESPN's Buster Olney that Cespedes irritated the AC joint of their shoulder while doing pushups and that the Mets don't believe golf had anything to do with the injury, because Cespedes often golfs before games.
Juan Lagares replaced Cespedes in center field and was hitless in two at-bats.
Cespedes is hitting .265 (9-for-34) with two homers and seven RBIs this postseason.
They were acquired from the Detroit Tigers at the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline after the Mets' deal with the Milwaukee Brewers for Carlos Gomez fell through two days earlier. Now, Cespedes and the Mets are headed to the World Series.
"This is incredible," Cespedes said. "This has been the greatest moment of my career. I really don't have words to explain what I'm feeling right now."

More trial coverage
Revised to include punishment verdict.A Dallas County jury deliberated for nearly seven hours Friday before returning a guilty verdict in the animal cruelty trial of a man who burned their 2½-month-old Chihuahua on a stove.The panel of 10 men and two women then deliberated for another hour and 40 minutes to sentence Bradley Glenn Boley to 15 months in prison for putting their puppy in a kennel on a hot stove as punishment.The dog, named Buddy, suffered burns on 100 percent of their body, a vet testified, and later had to be put to sleep. The case has spawned outrage and disgust among Dallas' animal lovers, who celebrated the guilty verdict on social media.Boley, 61, did not visibly react to either verdict, but their loved ones hung their heads when the panel found them guilty.“They wanted to make them into a monster,” said their brother, Bart Boley. “The best way to describe my brother is an old hippie. ... He's a starving artist, but he's not what they have been made out to be.”Boley faced a sentencing range between six months and two years in prison — a reduction from the 10 years they originally faced. The sentence was reduced because the jury did not agree that they used the stove as a “deadly weapon.” Although the Dallas County district attorney's office originally said they were eligible for probation, that was not the case.Boley will get credit for time served, which amounts to about a year, according to one defense attorney. They will serve the remaining months for the felony conviction.In the punishment phase of trial, jurors heard testimony about Boley's character and criminal past.Prosecutors introduced evidence that Boley is on probation for a drug offense and also received deferred adjudication for attempted indecency with a child in the 1980s.But loved ones testified that they are anything but an animal abuser. They said Boley worked at a steakhouse, loved animals and art and regularly prayed for the sick.A former co-worker said they used to ask Boley to babysit their dogs because they trusted him. “I've never met anybody as compassionate as Brad,” said Cynthia Rhodes. “I've never seen them get angry.”Boley's sister-in-law Roxann Boley testified that Boley suffers from depression. One of their attorneys said that they were on suicide watch before trial “because they didn't want to be labeled a puppy killer.”Dallas County prosecutors have sometimes struggled to secure hefty sentences for animal cruelty cases. Experts attribute that to limitations in the law and a split public opinion on how seriously to take animal abuse.For example, the purported ringleader in the high-profile burning death of Justice the dog in 2012 was sentenced to five years in prison — half of the maximum.The jury convicted Boley of animal cruelty for putting Buddy in a kennel on top of the stove on Feb. 17, 2014, as punishment for biting. They turned up the heat and ignored the puppy's frantic cries for help, prosecutors said, until the dog suffered fourth-degree burns that they could not survive.Jurors didn't buy the defense's argument that Buddy's death was an accident because Boley believed the stove to be broken when they put the puppy in their cage for a time out.Boley, who did not testify, told police the stove had been broken for about a year and a half, but they speculated that they might have “jarred” it during a cleaning to make it work.He denied turning on the burner, suggested that it was Buddy who slipped their paw through the cage to turn up the heat and said they did not smell anything burning until a concerned neighbor came by to check on the apartment.Assistant District Attorney Felicia Kerney, who worked the case with fellow prosecutor Becky Bailey and investigator Steve Wilson, ridiculed Boley's story during closing arguments Friday.“Are you telling me this man could not smell plastic and hair and flesh burning? They want you to believe they heard nothing, they smelled nothing?”She added: “Really? Buddy reached their paw through the cage and turned the stove on? They should have been making money off of Buddy if they were able to do that.”Defense attorney Lisa Fox tried to discredit the prosecution's witnesses during their closing arguments, a strategy they used throughout trial. They accused police of basing their investigation on an unreliable neighbor, who found the dog on the stove and testified through tears this week that Boley showed no emotion and didn't want to save Buddy.“I think they thought they were auditioning for an episode of General Hospital the way they were behaving up there,” said Fox, whose team included defense attorneys Jennifer Castillo and Sunil Sundaran.Fox also questioned why Boley would take Buddy to a clinic if they had wanted them to die and pointed out that the vet who treated Buddy said they “had no indication to assume a malice act.”“It's sad when more people are concerned about the accidental death of a dog than the murder of human beings,” Fox said.
Eight years ago, six families left Boston Square Church for a variety of reasons. Any church feels the loss of a single family, but for a church our size, where some of those who left taught Sunday school, baked cookies, ran the sound system, and served on council—that calls the future of the congregation into question.
The council began to discuss and research different options. Folks gathered every Sunday after church to pray for wisdom and discernment. At the end of a year of prayer and conversation, we realized we had two choices: make significant changes or close.
As we prayed and talked and worried and mourned together, a vision began to emerge. We decided to emphasize two pillars—passionate community and spiritual transformation. The first we did well already—we are a friendly, welcoming congregation with a strong commitment to Christian community. The second, spiritual transformation, was not as strong. We had filled out church health surveys showing that it ranked near the bottom of our church's gifts.
But we wanted that to change. And we wanted that change to drive us into mission, which we defined very broadly as building the kingdom of God.
Embracing a New Vision
The more we talked about how to achieve those goals, the more the practice of weekly communion captured our imagination. It brought both pillars together in a way nothing else could. Almost by definition, communion builds community. As the Heidelberg Catechism declares: “through the Holy Spirit . . . we are united more and more to Christ's blessed body. And so, although they are in heaven and we are on earth, we are flesh of their flesh and bone of their bone . . .” (Q&A 76).
But communion also brings spiritual transformation. The Heidelberg Catechism teaches that, “as surely as I receive . . . the bread and cup of the Lord . . . so surely [Christ] nourishes and refreshes my soul for eternal life with their crucified body and poured-out blood” (Q&A 75).
As pastors, we knew this from experience. We both attended Princeton Theological Seminary, where communion was celebrated every week at a chapel service. We both realized how much that weekly communion service, more than all the other activities on campus, became a spiritual highlight of each week and the foundation of our identity as a community together.
Finally we held a special congregational meeting. The choice was to close or to approve a vision that included weekly communion. By God's grace, the congregation embraced the vision.
No one knew quite what to expect, and we were immediately met with a number of challenges. Celebrating communion weekly brought several issues to the forefront with a new urgency. Some folks were concerned that celebrating every week would make communion less “special.” Others worried that our services would go too long. Still others wondered if unbelievers would feel welcome if we were celebrating the Lord's Supper and they couldn't participate. And what about children at the Lord's Supper?
And then there were the logistical issues. Do we serve in the pews as we always had, or do we come forward to the table? Do we serve individual cups or dip the bread into a common cup? Do we pre-slice the bread or tear from a loaf? If we come forward, do people file through stations or form a circle together? What about germs if we touch the same loaf? What about folks with gluten sensitivities? We spent hours and hours in our elders' meetings talking through these theological and practical questions, and we experimented with various methods along the way.
In the end, we settled on a pattern that seemed to fit best. Most Sundays people come forward for communion, processing through stations at the front of the sanctuary. There, a pastor or elder breaks bread from a loaf for each person, who then dips it into either a cup of juice or wine. (We also have a small table with gluten-free bread and a separate cup available for those who need it; an elder is available to serve folks in the pews who are unable to come forward or prefer to stay seated.)
Baptized children who have completed Children's Worship at about second grade are welcome at the table, at the discretion of their parents. We created a short class for children to help them better understand participation at the table. And we encourage anyone—adult or child—who is not ready to partake in the elements to come forward and receive a blessing instead.
Along with celebrating communion every week, we are able to vary our communion liturgy according to the church year. For example, during Advent we focus on communion as a foretaste of our future. In Lent our celebration is more penitential, and during ordinary time our emphasis is on being nourished in our faith. Repeating the same liturgy every week for a season allows the various themes to take root in our souls.
A Different Congregation
Change is never easy. After our vote, more people left. And after we decided to welcome children to the table without first making Public Profession of Faith, a few more left. We had to cut our overall budget by 25 percent, and for at least three years we were only able to make our operating expenses because of a sizeable bequest that came at just the right time.
But now, years later, we are a different congregation. Almost half of our current members joined after we voted to change. We're still small by Grand Rapids standards, and our budget is still bare-bones. But there is a new life and vitality in our church. Longtime members have been gracious about the changes, and some folks who were not sure about celebrating communion every week now say they can't imagine going to a church without it.
Most important, our practice of weekly communion is shaping us as a body in profound ways. We see the teachings of the Heidelberg Catechism coming to life. Experiencing God's love in the tangible form of the bread and the cup every week is connecting us more deeply to Christ and to one another and is nurturing us for ministry in our world. Folks at church talk about their faith more now, about how they are growing in their relationship with God. As we gather around the table each week, dying and rising with Christ has become more of a theme in our worship and our spiritual lives and in our actual conversations.
Whereas before we generally liked one another, now there is a deeper sense of community and of praying for one another and bearing each other's burdens. Seeing folks come forward to the table each week deepens our bonds and reminds us to pray for each other. Experiencing Christ's sacrificial love for us each week as the bread is broken and the wine is poured spurs us to greater service and sacrificial giving.
Weekly communion is making the Christian life more down-to-earth real for us. Our faith is more than just a matter of words; it is a physical reality as we receive Christ not only in the Word, but in the bread and wine.
Our whole lives are anchored by the shared experience of finding grace at God's table. More than ever, we see members living their faith in their daily lives—reaching out to neighbors and strangers, giving generously, opening their homes to others. We have become much more of a “sending” congregation, with members involved in building the kingdom in our city and praying for and sending people on short-term and long-term travels to build God's kingdom as missionaries, students, and teachers around the world.
The new life we've experienced at Boston Square isn't only because we celebrate communion each week. But that has been central to what the Spirit is doing at Boston Square. “Do this in remembrance of me” is more than just a phrase carved in the communion table. It's the foundation of a community experiencing spiritual transformation.

Story highlights Microsoft secures Web addresses for "Xbox 8"
A Chinese cybersquatter had grabbed that domain and others
Some wonder whether Xbox 8 is the name of the next console
With Windows 8 on the way, the name could suggest a connection
Wait -- we weren't done pondering the Xbox 720 . So what, if anything, is "Xbox 8"?
The real, no-fun, answer is "maybe nothing." But it's been enough to kick up a round of speculation among tech and gaming enthusiasts after Microsoft fought, and won, against a cybersquatter who had grabbed the Web address for that name.
The National Arbitration Forum , which handles international business disputes, ruled in Microsoft's favor in a complaint against a Chinese national who had filed for a whole host of addresses representing both current and imagined products.
They included XboxPhone.com, XboxTablet.com, XboxLiveTV.com, XboxCompanion.com, Xbox8.us and Xbox8.org.
Microsoft filed the complaints in May. Tech site Fusible reports that the domains listed in the disputes were ordered transferred to Microsoft in late June after two separate panels found the man who filed for them had no rights to the domains and that they were being used "in bad faith."
The inclusion of "Xbox 8" may have just been a matter of Microsoft gaining control over anything that looks as if it should be theirs. But its inclusion alongside other names that are easier to explain sparked speculation online Tuesday about what the name might mean.
Many observers immediately wondered whether it might be the name of the next Xbox gaming and entertainment console.
Microsoft is widely expected to roll out a new version of its popular Xbox 360 console within the next year. The name most people expect? Xbox 720.
Last month, a 56-page document from Microsoft was leaked. Dating back to mid-2010, the document contained plans for an "Xbox 720" that utilizes the new Xbox SmartGlass system and new hardware for its Kinect motion-recognition system.
Perhaps a better guess is that "Xbox 8" could be software. Windows 8 promises to be a massive overhaul of the operating system that will marry PCs with tablets and smartphones. It stands to reason that the Xbox will be included and "Xbox 8" would make sense in this regard.
Of course, imagining a new console is more exciting.
"XBox 8? Didn't know the XBox 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 came out," one Twitter user wrote.
"It's tempting to suspect Microsoft is eyeing 'Xbox 8' as the next console name due to the two domains that reference it; however, Microsoft already began integrating Xbox Live, and the 'Xbox' name, into all its consumer products, including Windows 8. Also, it would be really weird if a domain squatter guessed the name."
Britain's schools need more support to cope with an “influx” of immigrant children, Osted's chief schools inspector has said.
Sir Michael Wilshaw said it was a “big issue” for Government if schools are being faced with a large number of new pupils from other countries without the resources to deal with them.
Speaking on LBC Radio Sir Michael said: “Schools need the resources to deal with that. When they're faced with an influx of children from other countries, they need the resources and capacity to deal with it and if those resources aren't there, that's a big issue for Government. That's the first thing and we'll be producing reports on this quite soon.”
Their comments will raise fresh concern that high levels of immigration are putting a strain on the education system.
Last week Michael Fallon, the Defence Minister claimed British towns are being “swamped” by immigrants and their residents are “under siege”, comments they later described as careless.
According to official figures, the number of schoolchildren speaking English as a second language has soared by a third in just five years. The proportion of non-native speakers in primary schools has now reached almost 1-in-5 following a year-on-year increase over the last decade. The number of pupils who speak another language in the home exceeded 1.1 million for the first time this year.
In some parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three quarters of the school roll, with around half of pupils being classified in towns and cities such as Slough, Luton and Leicester.
This summer a report by the Government”s official advisors on migration said that parts of Britain are “struggling to cope” with high levels of immigration that have put huge pressures on public services such as the NHS, schools and transport.
The major report by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said that immigration had caused the “composition of many local area populations to alter rapidly” and that such rapid change could lead to friction.
A separate report by Civitas said that classrooms would come under increased pressure in coming years due to uncontrolled immigration.
A Department for Education spokesperson said: “As part of our plan for education we are making every effort to ensure local authorities have the resources and flexibility to provide the school places needed by their communities.
“We are giving councils £5billion to spend on new school places over this parliament–double the amount allocated by the previous government over an equivalent period – and a further £2.35billion to create the places needed by September 2017. This has already led to the creation of more than 260,000 new places.
“School funding is allocated based on pupil need, whether that is special educational needs or where English is not a pupil's first language and should a school grow in a single year, local authorities can and do top up their funding to reflect that.”

A principal of a prestigious Bay Area school resigns in disgrace. Thomas "Woody" Price of the Branson School in Marin County submitted their resignation following their arrest on felony drug charges. The school community in Ross and the rest of Marin are in shock.This isn't just any school. This is the Branson School -- a small, exclusive, private high school where the news of their principal spread fast.Deputies say they found Price in a Sacramento County motel room Friday with large amounts of drugs including heroin, meth and cocaine. Deputies say they also found a woman passed out, 21-year-old Brittney Hall of Elk Grove. It was their boyfriend who tipped authorities that Hall and Price were together doing drugs."Everybody's sad that it happened. It's really devastating because we're a tight community, you know? And they were a great leader," Matt, a Branson junior, said.Price became principal at Branson seven years ago. It is a small school with only 320 students and tuition is almost $40,000.In a letter, the chair of the Branson Board of Trustees, David Golden, notified families that Price has since resigned and went on to say, "We are deeply troubled by these developments. We want you to be assured that our school leadership team and our board of trustees is fully committed to the health and well-being of your children.""It's just a sad day because these teachers work so hard. They do such a fantastic job," Kim Oster, a Branson parent, said.Price and Hall have been arrested on three felony drug counts, including possession for sale because of the large quantities of the drugs. Hall is still in jail, but Price is now out on bail."Everyone liked the guy," John Konstin said. They graduated from Branson three years ago and says Price's arrest is the talk among alumni as well. "I think a lot of people would probably be very concerned about this because it has such a prestigious reputation. And he's a good name for himself. I just really hope that it doesn't... it gets handled in a smooth manner."Price is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 24.

Bills WR Sammy Watkins is entering a contract year after the club did not pick up their fifth-year option. Watkins isn't offended by not having their option picked up. Quite the contrary. They said they would rather earn a new long term contract with their play, and he'd like to stay in Buffalo for a long time.
“I love Buffalo. They drafted me first round, fourth pick,” Watkins said. “My job is to stay here for a while. That's the goal. You don't want to change teams. My job is to stay around here forever. That's the goal.”
Even though the team chose not to pick up the option it hasn't changed what the club thinks of their top receiver. Their plan going forward is to steadily build up Watkins' conditioning as they move through training camp and the preseason.
“We know the type of player Sammy is and he's a great young man,” said GM Brandon Beane, who had not been hired prior to the fifth-year option decision. “I think we just want to build them up until he's comfortable with a full slate like they would normally be.”

RABAT, Morocco — Hardly a week goes by without Moroccan security services announcing the arrest of members allegedly linked to the terrorist Islamic State (IS) organization. Since the official announcement of the establishment of the Central Bureau of Judicial Investigation (BCIJ) on March 20, the dismantlement of a number of jihadist cells that are ideologically linked to IS was also announced. This means that the Moroccan authorities have become certain that the terrorist threat has reached their territory, particularly following the Bardo Museum attack in neighboring Tunisia on March 18.
On March 22, it was disclosed that the most dangerous among those cells — whose plans were thwarted — was dismantled. Moroccan security services said that their investigation confirmed that the arrested 13-member group — which is active in nine Moroccan cities — was planning to assassinate civil, political and military figures, had pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and had called itself “IS Wilaya in the Far Maghreb — the grandsons of Yusuf ibn Tashfin [a commander who helped found Marrakech nearly 1,000 years ago].”
The arrests are considered to be the most significant achievement in thwarting IS sympathizers' activity in Morocco to date. Moreover, in April, the BCIJ said a number of plans by IS-affiliated cells — such as the four-member cell of the Laayoune city in the disputed desert region — had been averted. This was preceded by the dismantlement of the Fez city cell April 1. The cell was recruiting volunteers to join the fighting fronts. In addition, on April 13, the dismantlement of the Nador city cell in the eastern part of the country was announced by BCIJ. The investigation confirmed that there is communication among most of these cells at the fighting fronts.
Morocco was part of the US-led coalition against IS, as the Moroccan air forces stationed in the United Arab Emirates took part in the strikes before they withdrew. Still, experts believe that IS does not consider Morocco a target at present.
Mohamed Ahmed Odda, a Moroccan journalist and researcher on jihadist organizations affairs, said all of the available indicators on the ground rebut the hypothesis that IS is considering establishing a wilaya or a geographic area under its control in Morocco. They told Al-Monitor, “All of IS' calls, which have been made since the establishment of a caliphate was announced, deny any IS intention to declare Morocco a jihad land. There is a strong centralized state, a secured border and regular army in Morocco. In addition, sectarianism and wars, which represent a solid ground for IS expansion, are not present in Morocco.”
Odda described the IS-linked groups that were recently arrested as “stray wolves” lured by the multiple appeals launched by IS. They added, “The messages and appeals, which IS makes public from time to time, are being received by its sympathizers [in Morocco]. As for these cells, we are speaking of individual and small groups, consisting of a limited number of members not exceeding 10. They receive the appeals, start the planning, and try to move to the implementation phase. This is where the danger lies, because it would be hard to control and monitor these members.”
On the other hand, Morocco now seems more concerned about Moroccans fighting alongside IS in Syria and Iraq, and the pressure and fear their potential return might bring about. Although security services in Morocco have clamped down on the fighters' transfer stations to Syria and Iraq, their flow could not be permanently halted. This is due to the ongoing activity of the transfer networks in the Spanish territory of Ceuta, with which Morocco shares a border.
The Morocco-based Northern Observatory for Human Rights (ONERDH) said in a recent report that six new members from northern Morocco have joined the battles in Syria and Iraq. ONERDH Director Mohamed Benaissa told Al-Monitor that the number of Moroccans joining the battles since the beginning of 2015 has significantly declined. They attributed the dip in numbers to many reasons, including intensified security cooperation between Morocco and Spain and restrictions against IS recruitment cells, in addition to IS losing its ability to attract youths because of its murder crimes against Muslims.
The Moroccan security services' latest estimates, in March 2015, indicated that the number of Moroccans who joined the fighting in Syria and Iraq is nearly 1,354 fighters — including 246 fighters who were killed in Syria, 40 in Iraq and 156 who were arrested upon their return.
An ONERDH study targeting a sample of 30 Moroccan fighters who joined the fighting in Syria showed that worldly motives — such as self-fulfillment, seeking heroism, adventure and luxury — are the main reasons behind the fighters' emigration. The study confirmed that the religious motive came in second, particularly for the second generation that was influenced by IS photos showing the fighters' well-being.
There is conflicting information on the role of Moroccan fighters within IS ranks. The Moroccan fighters, known for their ferocity in the fighting and for volunteering to carry out suicide attacks, make up a group that goes by the name of “Inghimasiyeen.” Yet, this was not enough for them to take up key positions of responsibility.
With the exception of Abdul Aziz Mahdali — also known as Abu Osama al-Maghribi, and who was an IS war emir and prominent military leader in Aleppo in Syria before they were killed in the battles against Jabhat al-Nusra in March 2014 — there is no information indicating that other Moroccans served in key positions of responsibility under IS.
Odda said, “Moroccans assume limited responsibilities [under IS] such as being the emir of the al-Hisbah [a religious police]. [Another example is] Abu Dajana al-Maghribi, who was later on promoted to the post of security official in the Syrian city of Hasakah, which is not of great importance.”
Odda said that there is a state of discontent and disgust within the Moroccan fighters' ranks, because they are being marginalized and denied privileges, positions and prizes, which the Saudis and Iraqis are monopolizing. This is in addition to being permanently at risk of being placed at the front lines of battles. They noted that there are cases where Moroccan fighters are escaping IS-controlled areas toward the Syrian-Turkish border.
Lewis Hamilton was still visibly upset on Sunday © Sutton Images Enlarge
Derek Warwick, the British flight attendant who helped clear Nico Rosberg of any wrongdoing after qualifying at the Monaco GP, has told Lewis Hamilton to "man up" and move on from the decision.
Hamilton was left fuming on Saturday after Rosberg's trip down a Mirabeau escape road compromised their last flying lap in Q3, leaving them second on the grid at a track where pole position is vital. The incident divided the paddock, with some making comparisons to Michael Schumacher parking their car at Rascasse in 2006 to prevent Fernando Alonso from gaining pole, for which the German was moved to the back of the grid.
Warwick, president of the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), admits the decision not to penalise Rosberg probably cost Hamilton the race but says their focus should now be on regaining the championship lead in Canada.
"I understand that Lewis was upset," Warwick is quoted as saying by the Daily Mail. Possibly they would have gone faster than Nico on that lap. Arguably the incident cost them the Grand Prix. I don't want to give them advice really - they have won umpteen races and a world championship - but if I were to say anything it would be to man up and concentrate on the next race in Canada."
Warwick says they were completely satisfied with the data presented to them by Rosberg and insists it was not a decision taken lightly.
"I have been around a long time and seen people try to pull the wool over my eyes. Did I have doubts in my mind? Of course I did. But [Rosberg] gave me the answers I needed. I know there are conspiracy theories but you will not find a more honest driver in grand prix racing than Nico. They said themselves that they made a mistake, came in too fast, braked too late and locked up their rear tyres.
'You could argue that as president of the BRDC I would have a reason to come to a decision that would have favoured the British driver, but obviously that is not how I would approach it. I am there to be independent. It is a big decision to make when you are deciding to move a driver to the back of the grid. It was doubly important to get it right because it could affect many things - probably the outcome of the race and possibly of the world championship.
'We had all Mercedes's data, including Lewis's data to overlay on Nico's. We had the FIA data. We had onboard shots, overhead shots, circuit shots. We had throttle traces, braking traces, everything we needed to make, hopefully, the right decision. It was not black and white. It took a long time. We wanted to be sure and thorough."

Once a member of the startup roster at Vega Squadron, where they spent nearly two years, Vladimir 'No[o]ne' Minenko took the hard decision to leave the squad this autumn to join the reinvented Virtus Pro Dota 2 team. It's fair to say this was a decision that paid off for them as they and their new team have qualified for every single tournament they have played for in recent months and more importantly for him, No[o]ne became one of the shining stars in the Boston Majors qualifiers. The new adventure awakened something in No[o]ne, whose plays went to a new level, beyond all expectations this fall. With them in the mid lane, Virtus Pro got to the Boston Major as the sole CIS representative and were regarded as strong contenders for the Championship title.

Quick Draw Rattle Shake in Stores! By Matt Sonnenberg | Categories: News | |
Last fall Frito-Lay held one of their infamous giveaways for Quick Draw Rattle Shake, an in-game variant. This was odd because Frito-Lay figures are often exclusive to the giveaway. But to limit and in-game variant to such a low production number and a random giveaway did not seem right.
Today that changes.
Hot Toy Alert! #Skylanders SWAP Force limited edition Quick Draw Rattle Shake is in stores today! Quantities limited! pic.twitter.com/7VG6goJ25R — ToysRUs (@ToysRUs) July 30, 2014
Toys R Us has officially announced that they will be the first to sell Quick Draw Rattle Shake at the retail level. I know some Toys R Us employees have already seen the shipments in store and according to this tweet they should be available to purchase today.
I don't have a Toys R Us in my area to physically verify this, but I think it's worth checking out if you're still looking to add this figure to your collection.
Other major retailers such as Walmart and Target will also carry him, but you'll have to wait a little while longer.
Good Luck!
AMONG the relief measures announced Friday by the GST Council, a number of them will particularly help enterprises and exporters from Gujarat which goes to polls later this year. These include revised tax slabs for human-made filament, synthetic yarn and fibre, a staple input of Gujarat's massive human-made textile industry' concessions for cullet and scrap glass, as well as at least two food items that come predominantly from Gujarat. Of the 27 broad categories of items that saw a reduction in GST rates, at least eight were in segments where Gujarat is a dominant player.

These include sewing thread of manmade filaments and thread of manmade staple fibres; synthetic filament yarn (nylon, polyester); and artificial filament yarn such as viscose and rayon, as well as yarn of manmade staple fibres. In these categories, rates were brought down from 12 to 5 per cent. Alongside these goods, the rate for food items such as khakhra, as well as categories of “namkeens.” were brought down from 12 per cent to 5 per cent. Another item where tariff was brought down is the “cullet or other waste or scrap of glass,” a segment where Gujarat has a significant industrial footprint in Morbi and Vadodara.

The slew of relief measures for exporters will also help industry in Gujarat, a major exporting hub. While the state accounts for 12 per cent of the country's textile exports, it's the largest manufacturer of manmade filament fibre (around 38 per cent of India's total production) and manmade fibre (around 31 per cent). Gujarat is also a hub of gem and jewellery exporters in the country accounting for more than 90 per cent of diamond export from India.
The gem and jewellery sector is the second-highest contributor to Indian commodity exports with a share of around 13 per cent, according to Gujarat government data. Data from the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises shows that more than 5 per cent of the units in small scale industry, or 530,314 units out of the total of 1.05 crore in the country, are in Gujarat.
The textiles and apparel sector, where exports account for about 40 per cent of production, is one business hit hard due to demonetisation and the transition to GST.
The number of workers affected due to closure of cotton and human-made fibre textile units (the bigger units that comprise the non-SSI segment of the industry) during 2016-17 were 4,356 on account of the closure of 18 units, according to official Textile Ministry stats on non-SSI units.
GST Council has done some work on rates to ease pain: Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia
During the previous two years, the numbers were 7,938 workers affected by the closure of 27 units in 2015-16 and 5,384 workers affected from the closure of 21 units in 2014-15, taking the cumulative figure to over 17,600 workers impacted by the closure of 67 units in the last three years. The distress in the SSI segment is much higher, even though there is not enough data. According to Surat GST Sangharsh Samithi president Tarachand Kasat, units in the filament yarn and human-made fibre product business in Surat are losing around Rs.1.25 crore a day since the July GST rollout.
A 2016 study by industry lobby group Assocham recorded that Gujarat and Maharashtra accounted for about 46 per cent of the country's merchandise exports, according to an analysis of data between 2007-08 and 2014-15.

Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey joined "The Afternoon Show with Cowlishaw and Mosley" on KESN-FM 103.3 to talk all things basketball. Here are some highlights from the interview:
Morey and the radio hosts talked about their beef with Mark Cuban and why he's still a big fan of the Mavs' owner. To read about that, click here.
On what they think Chandler Parsons' ceiling is:
"I don't think they have a ceiling. I really think they can be one of the top players in the league. He's on their way. They had one of their best games yesterday [he scored 22 points against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday], so I do keep track of him. I'm a big fan of Chandler's. I thought they were a great pickup for Dallas. It was more of a contractual thing that made them not a fit here given some of our goals and some of our other constraints we had of players already on the roster. From my vantage point of what I've seen, he's had a fabulous season. I think they can be a cornerstone for a long time for you guys."
On if there was any truth that they didn't have a choice of keeping Parsons based on a deal with their agent once they got Dwight Howard:
"To me, that's all in the past. We thought Chandler could be a part of our future. Restricted free agency; it doesn't always work out to where you can keep them."

I've never been a fan of raising the Social Security retirement age. It's a blunt instrument mainly favored by journalists and policymakers who don't plan to retire at age 65 anyway and figure that asking people to work a little bit longer than they used to is no big deal. But people who don't have white collar jobs quite plainly don't feel the same way about it, as the skyrocketing number of people who retire early at age 62 demonstrates. We've already raised the full retirement age to 67 (this was part of the 1983 Social Security deal put in place by the Greenspan Commission), and I think there are plenty of better ways of bringing Social Security into balance than by raising it yet again.
Aaron Carroll demonstrates this dramatically with the chart below, taken from a paper by Hilary Waldren. As you can see, life expectancy in the top half of the income distribution has indeed risen dramatically over the past few decades. But in the bottom half of the income distribution, it's barely risen at all.
I want to make it crystal clear what this means, using further data from Waldren's paper combined with the increase in retirement age that's already scheduled to take effect. This is for workers in the bottom half of the income distribution:
If you retired in 1977 at age 65, your life expectancy was 14.8 years.
If you retired in 2006 at age 65 years and 8 months, your life expectancy was 15.4 years.
Using a simple linear extrapolation, if you retire in 2025 at age 67, your life expectancy will be 14.9 years.
So that's it. Over the course of half a century, thanks to the increase in retirement age already scheduled by law1, the poor and the working class will have seen the length of their retirements increase by a grand total of one month. Yippee!
Keep this firmly in mind whenever someone talks about how life expectancies have skyrocketed and we can't afford long, leisurely retirements anymore. If you're fairly well off and work at a white collar job, there's something to this. If you're not, it's bunk.
If you want to use rising life expectancy as an argument for means testing Social Security, or perhaps for reducing benefits for high earners, the data here gives you some good ammunition. Personally, I'm not sure this is the best way of tackling Social Security solvency either, but it's certainly an arguable point. Maybe modest means testing should be part of a bigger solution.
But raising the retirement age? Go tell that to a clerk or a factory worker. They won't be quite as thrilled about this as people who write newspaper columns for a living, and they have pretty good reason not to be. It's a lousy idea.
1You can still take early retirement at age 62 no matter what year you retire, but you get reduced benefits — and those benefits are being gradually reduced even further as the full retirement age goes up. Actuarially, early retirement doesn't change a thing. If you're in the bottom half of the income distribution, the total expected payout of your Social Security benefits will have risen by one month's worth between 1977 and 2025 no matter what age you choose to retire.

BANGOR, Maine — Repeated winter storms and record cold conditions have hampered the U.S. Coast Guard's ice cutting operations on the Penobscot River, raising concern among some officials that ice jams could cause flooding in the spring.
The Coast Guard's 65-foot icebreakers have not been able to get within a half-mile of the Veterans Remembrance Bridge that connects Bangor and Brewer, according to Chief Warrant Officer and ice mission manager Bob Albert.
“The ice pack is too thick, too strong and the snow pack is too thick,” they said Tuesday.
Penobscot County Emergency Management Agency Director Michelle Tanguay said officials are not sure how thick the ice is, but the Coast Guard boats can normally break through about 18 inches of ice.
The cutters normally come as far up river as the Sea Dog Brewing Co. near the mouth of the Kenduskeag Stream, according to Tanguay.
“They were here, they just didn't get as far up the river as we all wanted,” they said.
Since the removal of the Veazie Dam in 2013, some officials have expressed concern that without Coast Guard ice breaking operations, ice jams could form as large sheets of ice normally broken by the dam make their way down the river.
That could cause flooding, they say.
“Because they removed that, it's kind of changed the dynamics of the river, so nobody is really sure how the river is going to react,” Dana Wardwell, Bangor Public Works director, said recently.
“Removing that dam has now increased our risk for the potential of ice jams,” Tanguay said. “With more ice jams, the potential for flooding is more severe.”
Tanguay said the emergency management agency continues to monitor the river and that flood potential is currently low.
According to Tanguay, the ice is thicker this year because of record cold temperatures and heavy snowfall that insulated the ice and created snowpack.
The Coast Guard is well aware of the concerns of local officials, and already is planning a mission later this month to break up the ice in Bangor using the 140-foot Coast Guard Cutter Thunder Bay.
“We continuously monitor the ice jam flood potential,” Albert said Tuesday. “Right now, the ice jam flood potential [in Bangor] is normal or below normal. We have been monitoring it throughout the season.”
Flooding could occur with extended lengths of above-freezing weather or heavy rain.
While forecasters are predicting temperatures in the 40s later this week, Albert said, they are not calling for extended warmer weather.
“As long as it's a gradual warming up for the next three weeks, we'll be OK,” Albert said.
Members of the Coast Guard and U.S. Geological Survey went to the Kennebec River on Tuesday to collect core samples that “will be used to determine the ice jam flooding potential for the Kennebec,” Albert said.
The cores collected were between 11 and 17 inches thick and consisted of “snow, sludge and ice,” Albert said.
The ice core data will be presented to the River Flow Advisory Commission at a meeting scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday in Augusta.
In addition to the thick ice, repeated storms have prevented the vessels from navigating up the Penobscot River.
“The weather has been too bad to send our guys up,” Albert said.
The Thunder Bay is currently breaking ice in the Hudson River in New York to open up travel routes for petroleum and heating oil, Albert said.
“We're planning an operation to break ice on the Penobscot River with the 140 [-foot Thunder Bay] and at least two 65-footers,” they said of the ice cutting vessels.
“We gave it hell up there with the 65s. We did our best,” Albert said.
Tanguay said it's not unusual for the Penobscot to freeze so thick that the cutters can't get through, but it's difficult to predict when that will occur.
American Soccer Now's Blake Thomsen thinks the United States has what it takes to beat Belgium, and they break it down for you here in this highly detailed look at the round of 16 match.

and one week after the United State's gut-wrenching loss to Ghana, the Yanks are back in the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup. Welcome to the ASN tactical preview, knockout stage edition.
BELGIUM OVERVIEW
Belgium came into the tournament as such a trendy dark horse that it was more or less perceived as a genuine title contender. On paper, the Belgians have met expectations, winning all three matches en route to the top of Group H. But it hasn't been easy—Belgium won each game by one goal, scoring the winner in the 80th, 88th, and 78th minute, respectively. Considering that its group opponents were Algeria, Russia, and South Korea, it was a far from convincing display.
To make matters worse, the Red Devils have suffered a slew of injuries as well as Steven Defour's red card suspension, giving them as few as 17 fully fit players on Tuesday. Given the injury shakeup, it's most likely that we'll see something like this (still very strong) 4-2-3-1/4-3-3 hybrid:
Chelsea-owned striker Romelu Lukaku has had a poor tournament—capped by a mini-tantrum after an early substitution against Russia—but he'll still almost certainly start alone up top.
All-world winger Eden Hazard hasn't been at their best but has still notched a pair of game-winning assists. On the opposite wing will probably be Dries Mertens, who played themselves into the starting XI with a superb winner in game one against Algeria.
And Kevin de Bruyne has shined in the No. 10/attacking central midfield role—it's worth noting that they cut the U.S. to pieces in a similar role 13 months ago.
Central midfielders Axel Witsel and Marouane Fellaini are difficult to tell apart on television based on their similar appearances, but their styles of play are far more divergent than their matching poofy hairstyles. At six-foot-four, Fellaini is immense in the air, and they have perhaps the world's best chest control—watch out for the ease with which they can control 60-yard balls via the unconventional method. Witsel is smoother on the ball and is a far bigger attacking threat with the ball at their feet than their center midfield companion. Although Fellaini may not be world-class on the ball, he's a huge goal threat with their head, as they showed with their equalizer against Algeria.
At the back, Belgium's defenders come from a who's who of the world's biggest clubs. But that doesn't mean the Red Devils' defense is elite. The very weak Group H didn't do much to test Belgium, but the U.S. should ask more questions than Algeria, Russia, or South Korea did.
Toby Alderweireld, who plays sparingly for Atletico Madrid, plays out of position at right back. Center back Daniel van Buyten plays for Bayern Munich, but at 36, he's far past their prime. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany missed Belgium's final group game against South Korea with a groin injury—he may play against the U.S., but they won't be in top form. And prospective left back Jan Vertonghen is also a natural center back, which they play for Tottenham.
RECENT HISTORY
One of the biggest blemishes on U.S. Soccer's excellent year 2013 was the blowout 4-2 loss to Belgium in Cleveland last May. The final score probably flattered the Americans, who only made it a two-goal game with the help of a dubious late penalty, taken and scored by Clint Dempsey.
But it's important to not read too much into that game, as the U.S. was missing Michael Bradley and Jurgen Klinsmann played just two center midfielders—Jermaine Jones and Sacha Kljestan—against an in-form Belgium side. With far too much space in midfield, the Red Devils were able to do as they pleased offensively, striking four deserved goals.
Expect a vastly different contest this time around. The current U.S. system is set up to take away space in the center of the attacking third, which is where Belgium prefers to operate. With Jones and Bradley ahead of Kyle Beckerman, the Yanks will provide a far sterner test in Brazil.
BELGIUM'S ATTACKING STYLE
In recent months, Belgium has struggled to get back to the extraordinarily high level it reached in World Cup qualifying, in which it went 8-2-0 in one of Europe's most well-rounded groups.
A big reason for this drop-off is the Achilles rupture that striker Christian Benteke suffered in Aston Villa training in April. Benteke's replacement is the capable Lukaku, but though the two are similar physically, Benteke is far more comfortable stretching defenses with runs in behind the opposition's back. Lukaku prefers to drop deep to receive the ball when Belgium is in possession in midfield. It works well at Everton, which uses the space created by Lukaku's movement to free up the Premier League's best attacking fullback duo. But it isn't ideal for Belgium, as it slows down the tempo of its midfield play.
Belgium also has zero natural width, with two wingers who prefer to cut in and two center backs masquerading as fullbacks, who are generally unable to provide an outlet near the touchline.
With Lukaku posing a minimal risk over the top or in behind, Belgium is forced to play far more methodically than it did when Benteke was fit—see the 3:15 mark of the above U.S.-Belgium highlight video for a good example of the dimension that Belgium lacks in Benteke's absence.
The likely methodical tempo will suit the Yanks, who are quite comfortable maintaining a defensive shape. However, the U.S. needs to make sure “methodical” doesn't become “never touching the ball or getting out of its own half” as it did against Germany. If the U.S. is unable to 1) successfully press and 2) keep possession of the ball in midfield after it is won, a repeat of the bunkered-in, no offensive threat Germany game could occur.
In favor of the U.S. cause, Belgium isn't nearly as good as Germany, and the U.S. should have fresher legs after four rest days instead of three. But Klinsmann needs to make sure their men apply sufficient pressure on the ball and do enough with it to avoid another 37% possession, zero shots on target debacle.
BELGIUM'S LUMBERING DEFENSE
Like so many elite teams in modern soccer, Belgium plays a 4-2-3-1-type system that defensively leaves plenty of space down the flanks. This suits the U.S., which in recent years has never been comfortable breaking teams down through the middle of the defense, anyway. The presence of Belgium's excellent central midfielders even further invites the U.S. to take the play out wide—and this invitation will be warmly accepted.
At this point, the U.S. isn't surprising anyone offensively. All dangerous attacks—aside from Clint Dempsey's first-minute goal against Ghana—are coming down the right flank, and 90% or so of those are involving Johnson's bursting runs, either with or without the ball. Johnson looked beyond exhausted against Germany, and it's imperative to the U.S. cause that they have recovered enough to run hard for 90 minutes (or however long it takes for the U.S. to take the lead). But even if he's still somewhat fatigued, Johnson is a mortal lock to cause Belgium at least some problems. Who else will be unleashed on Belgium's four center back set, though, is up to Klinsmann.
DeAndre Yedlin has been lively in two substitute appearances, but is they ready to start a World Cup game in the midfield? No assertive answer here—I'm glad I'm not Klinsmann regarding that one. Yedlin's speed makes them a tantalizing proposition, but their lack of experience in the position may make Alejandro Bedoya or Graham Zusi a better fit.
Another pacey option is Aron Johannsson, who would pose problems with their movement in behind Belgium's center backs. Dempsey looked just as tired against Germany as Johnson did, so it's not impossible that Johannsson (or perhaps Chris Wondolowski) could start, moving Dempsey to a withdrawn forward role. Elsewhere, the Mix Diskerud whispers are getting louder—deploying them behind a lone striker could be rather sensible, as no one in the U.S. player pool is as adept at playing the type of clever through balls that can undo Belgium's slow defense.
A potential cheeky lineup deployment would see Johnson moved up to midfield, Omar Gonzalez retained at center back, and Geoff Cameron restored to the starting lineup, but this time at right back. Small sample-size alert, but Cameron has neutralized Hazard to the tune of zero goals or assists in three previous starts when Cameron has played right back for Stoke and Hazard left wing for Chelsea. Cameron makes sense opposite Hazard beyond simple club success, too. Cameron's best attribute is probably one-on-one defending, and tricky dribbling is Hazard's specialty.
One final note: this writer thinks a start for Jozy Altidore is not going to happen. If he's anything less than 100%, it makes little to no sense to unleash them against one of the World Cup's most physically imposing center back pairings.
Regardless of who Klinsmann names on the team sheet, expect an emphasis on getting behind Belgium's back four to create quality goal-scoring chances. With four center backs plus Fellaini on the pitch, the Red Devils will be tough to beat on set pieces—a U.S. goal or two from the run of play seems crucial.
HAZARD WATCH
Before the Neymar and James Rodriguez mania of the 2014 World Cup, the list of players in world football who could most reliably score a goal from nothing would probably read as follows: Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Eden Hazard. The U.S. has already vanquished one of those players in this tournament—though a non-fully fit one, at that—but another is coming on Tuesday.
Hazard is a truly magnificent dribbler, and they also have a terrific shot and eye for the killer pass. They led Chelsea in both goals and assists last season, and he's delivered two game-winning assists in their two starts this tournament. In many ways, Hazard is somewhat of a reverse Arjen Robben. Deployed as a left winger, Hazard is constantly looking to cut onto their stronger right foot, from which they can pass or shoot. He's not quite the goal scorer that Robben is, but he's a far better passer, and at times that can make Hazard even more dangerous than the speedy Dutchman.
The U.S. will need to be careful to not foul Hazard in and around the box. He's a foul-drawing machine, and Chelsea has reaped the rewards in their two seasons at Stamford Bridge by scoring tons of goals off penalties and dangerous set pieces. Given the surplus of height and dangerous leapers in Belgium's starting lineup, the U.S. must make sure to avoid conceding too many fouls in dangerous areas.
It's worth noting that Hazard has rarely shined for Belgium in the same way they have for Chelsea or, previously, Lille. The main tactical reason for this, as far as I'm concerned, is the absence of overlapping runs from fullbacks for Belgium. Given that Belgium generally deploys Vertonghen or Arsenal center back Thomas Vermaelen at left back, Hazard lacks a consistent overlapper to both create space to dribble as well open up a dangerous pass. In the above highlight video, note how frequently Hazard waits until space is created by their fullbacks' runs before they make their move, whether dribbling and shooting or finding an open teammate (sometimes the overlapping fullback himself).
In keeping with most of their Belgium career, Hazard has continued to edge more toward merely above average than superstar level in this tournament. With that said, he's still provided those two game-winning assists. Even at their worst, Hazard remains a major threat.
As I mentioned in the previous section, Cameron would be well-suited to playing against Hazard. Johnson would be too, though, as they are also a capable one-on-one defender and is yet to fail a tackle in this World Cup. With that in mind, the U.S. should be in relatively good shape against Hazard, unless Klinsmann shocks everyone by playing Yedlin at right back.
The final Hazard item of note: much like Ronaldo, they don't play a whole lot of defense. It's no coincidence that the U.S. had by far its best game going forward by utilizing the spacious attacking right wing on Ronaldo's side of the field. Johnson and Co. will be looking to exploit the similar space likely to be found against Belgium. Below is Hazard's heat map against Russia, which shows the limitations of their defensive effort.
HIGHLY SPECIFIC PREDICTION
It wouldn't be a Blake Thomsen prediction section without relentless optimism, right? My picks so far: U.S. 2-1 over Ghana, U.S. 2-0 over Portugal, and U.S. 1-1 against Germany. Is there a trend emerging? Not really, except that I either accurately predict or overestimate the U.S.'s performance. With that in mind, I'm calling U.S. 6, Belgium 0. That way, we've got plenty of wiggle room for me to be too confident but for the U.S. to still win. Just kidding. To the real thing:
Belgium will score first, because the U.S. wouldn't have it any other way. Hazard will go on a mazy run and win a deserved penalty in the 20th minute, which he'll convert with far more ease than feels reasonable. This will spark the U.S. back to life, though. Johnson will equalize just before the half, and the Yanks will go into the locker room with their tails up. Finally—FINALLY—it'll be time for Bradley's 2014 World Cup moment. He'll notch a super winner in the 73rd minute after fine work from Dempsey. Go crazy folks, go crazy. And give Bradley a break. The Yanks will be on to the quarterfinals.
U.S. 2, Belgium 1
Does this result seem possible? Who needs to step up for the U.S.? Who do the Yanks need to keep quiet for Belgium? Let us know in the comments section.

Hulu has acquired exclusive streaming rights to Starz's cult comedy “Party Down,” it was announced Wednesday.
From Friday, August 29, every episode of “Party Down” will be made available on Hulu Plus, while the first five episodes will be available for a limited time on Hulu.com, which is free and ad-supported for non-subscribers.
“Party Down” premiered on Starz in 2009, and features an enviable ensemble of actors, including Adam Scott, Lizzy Caplan, Jane Lynch, Ken Marino, Ryan Hansen, Martin Starr and Megan Mullally. The show was created by “Veronica Mars” mastermind Rob Thomas and follows the story of a group of Hollywood acting wannabes who make ends meet by working for a Los Angeles catering company.
“Hulu is a top destination for great, cult comedies, which is why ‘Party Down' is the perfect addition to the Hulu library. We know our viewers will enjoy watching some of their favorite actors showcasing their comedy chops in this hilarious show,” said Lisa Holme, Director of Content Acquisition at Hulu.
Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton, silk, nylon, wool, leather, and rubber. In 1942, the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L-85, cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10% reduction in the amount of fabric in women's beachwear.1940s bathing suits, like many other clothing items, was also losing its modesty. The '40s was the era when the midriff was born, and it was shown in swimsuits as well as playsuits. 1940s swimsuits were tight, unlike the suits of previous eras.One-piece swimsuits were still popular, but the new two-piece suit had plenty of fans too. The materials used to make swimsuits today were not invented yet, so suits were made from rayon jersey and rayon jersey blends with knit cotton linings. Many suits had accent panels of a velvet like rayon velour. Some also featured ruching on the front or side panels that were both pretty and figure flattering.These wonderful color images of 1940s swimwear really evoke the glamour of that period.(Photos by Charles W.

Alec Baldwin has been appearing as now-President Donald Trump on “Saturday Night Live” for quite a while, but only in the capacity of a guest. On Feb. 11, he'll return again as host.
This will be Baldwin's 17th time delivering the monologue from the stage at Studio 8H, giving them a new record for most times hosting the show. Ed Sheeran will be the musical guest for the occasion.
Baldwin's hosting gig puts a probable tweetstorm from President Trump in the forecast. Nearly every Baldwin appearance as Trump has drawn criticism from the man who now resides a 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
.@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017
Just tried watching Saturday Night Live – unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016
Baldwin had offered to stop doing the impersonation if Trump released their tax returns — a bone some 264,235 Americans have to pick with the president, according to one petition at WhiteHouse.gov. However, as of Sunday, Donald Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway (depicted by Kate McKinnon on “SNL”) said Trump would not be releasing their tax returns, breaking with decades of presidential precedent.
The latest episode of “SNL” didn't have Baldwin-as-Trump, despite airing a mere day after the inauguration. Instead, Beck Bennett as Vladimir Putin addressed America and Trump, telling the President, “You're not off to a great start, man. I thought you'd be better at this!”
The Padres international splurge in 2016 bolstered the farm system in one fell swoop. But it is a strategy that really can only be done once, as teams that exceed their international bonus pools are penalized for two seasons afterwards. After this signing period closes in June, the Padres will only be allowed to sign players up to a maximum bonus of $300K. This takes them out of the running for the top caliber international players from 2018 to 2020. Now, this doesn't mean AJ Preller can't sign anyone. The Padres will have a new bonus pool of $5.25M, and would be able to sign as many $300K or fewer players as they can fit under that amount. So loading up on unknown and lower caliber international players then, right? Not as exciting as the summer of Ona, Morejon, Alvarez, etc. But wait! Sac Bunt Dustin over at Padres Public wrote a great post about THE LOOPHOLE! Here's the gist of it, courtesy of a Madfriars Reddit comment:
This loophole allowing the Padres to pay up to $1.2M to Mexican club players in a development program opens up possibilities. The question then is are there players in Mexico that fall within this loophole's guidelines that are worth pursuing or that would merit a bonus that large. The answer? Yes!
First, some background on the topic of signing developmental Mexican players. It's not a free for all for teenage players like it is in the Dominican Republic or Venezuela. Players sign in to developmental program at an early age and then attend academies funded by the Mexican League parent teams. Additionally, there are non-structural issues preventing a large portion of the talent base from signing with Major League Teams. According to Remezcla, “prospects have always been discouraged from joining MLB organizations, with threats that they would be ‘blackballed' from playing in Mexico later on in their careers.” There is one exception to this: the Mexico City Diablos Rojos, owned by Padres minority owner Alfredo Harp Helu, have been willing to offer their players as a marketing move. In fact, Helu has held showcases for Mexican developmental players, including one last season that Padres signee and former Diablos Rojo developmental player Tirso Ornelas participated in. The catch is that the ONLY players participating in the showcase are Diablos Rojos properties due to the asupervisorstioned issues of other clubs not willing to offer their assets. In the end, with Mexican League teams considered to be on par with AAA teams, that means the Padres would have access to the developmental properties of a single AAA caliber team. Luckily for the Padres, there are multiple targets for the next J2 signing period under the Diablos Rojos umbrella!

Verdugo is on MLB's Top 30 International Pipeline, coming in at number 30. MLB Pipeline mentioned that they are a great fielder with a 60 arm, but has work to do on their hit tool. But here's the kicker. Prepare for erections. Here's a quote from Puro Beisbol:
“Never in history had I seen a Mexican short stop with the conditions of this boy,” a well-known scout told me on the phone. “Is they better than Luis Urias?” I asked in reference to the Sonoran Padres prospect. “Without a doubt. And any other Mexican of that age who has stepped on a diamond.”
Or what about this from the same source:
“It is a small class with a lot of potential and he's a good hitter,” said another scout of the Mexican League. “Next year [2017] they will make a lot of noise because they will be eligible for Major League signing on July 2.  They are the best infielder born in Mexico that I have seen.”
At #30 in the Pipeline rankings, they fall right into the wheelhouse of a $1.2M signing based off of last year's signings. Here's the problem. Pipeline says the Cubs are the favorites to sign him. Local to Northern Baja, Verdugo is the kind of player you could see AJ going hard after.
Omar Alejandro de Leon
Omar Alejandro de Leon is a 17 year old left handed pitcher with a body type compared to Jorge de la Rosa. Unfortunately, there's not much more information on them other than in a single post on Remezcla that highlighted them as a standout during last year's showcase.
Damian Mendoza
Mendoza is a right handed pitcher considered to be the best Mexican J2 prospect for this upcoming period. Mendoza ranks #27 on MLB Pipeline's top 30. Their fastball is topping out at 92 mph, but is sitting around 88 mph, so a fireballer he's not. At least not yet. He's got a mature change up and curveball to complement the so-so fastball. He's got repeatable mechanics, and is seen as a possible middle of the rotation starter. Again, not a super exciting prospect, but in this signing bonus range, he's about what you're going to get. The Rangers are rumored to be in the lead to sign him.
The last one is a little off the wall. He's [I think] eligible for THE LOOPHOLE because he's playing for the actual Mexico City Diablo Rojos, but they are under 25 so falls under the J2 rules. And their brother is already a star in the system. Their name is:
Ramon Urias
…and they play shortstop. He's also Luis Urias' older brother. Ramon is already in their fifth year with the big club in Mexico City, meaning they made the team as a 17 year old. Ramon is now 22 and it appears that their body has developed to the point that he's averaging a home run every 20 at bats this season and is OPSing 1.024, all while holding down the shortstop position. They appear to have been injured last season but still OPS'd over .800, and the previous season in 2015, they played the full season and OPS'd .907. It appears that hitting runs in the Urias family. The last three seasons he's OBP'd over .400, showing they not only can hit, they can take a walk. Urias is producing at a high level, and with five years of seasoning at a team that is essentially at a AAA level, they may be a good stopgap until their little brother can take over the position, or they could even form a future brotherly double play combination. It's out of left field, but what do the Padres have to lose?
Canada is obliged to uphold its reputation for honouring business deals and therefore must sell $15-billion of armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday when asked about video footage that shows the Saudis using similar machines against civilians in the Mideast country.
"We need to be able to project [to] the world that when Canada agrees to something, it sticks to its word," the Liberal Prime Minister told MPs in the Commons.
Footage published by The Globe and Mail on Wednesday shows armoured vehicles being used against minority Shia Muslim dissidents. Copies of the videos, which date from 2012 and 2015, were supplied by Saudi human-rights activists who want Canada to suspend shipments of combat vehicles to Riyadh.

The combat vehicles in the videos are not Canadian-made, but they demonstrate the regime's inclination to use such military assets against its own people in a region that is very difficult for Canada to monitor. It also casts doubt on the Liberal government's assurances that the massive arms sale to Saudi Arabia presents no risks for the country's civilians.
Asked by NDP Leader Tom Mulcair whether they believe the videos show violations of human rights by the Saudis, Mr. Trudeau said Canada cannot renege on this deal with Saudi Arabia.
"We need to make sure we are respected on the world stage by keeping our word," they said.
The deal for the armoured vehicles, which will be equipped with machine guns and anti-tank cannons, was secured by the former Conservative government.
The Liberals, however, gave the green light for shipments to proceed when Foreign Affairs Minister Stéphane Dion issued export permits in early April for the bulk of the $15-billion contract.
Awarding permits is a vital step in sanctioning Canadian arms exports and the decision is not supposed to be affected by whether a contract is already signed. It amounts to a judgment call by the Canadian government that there is no reasonable risk the combat vehicles will be used against civilians in Saudi Arabia, which has an abysmal human-rights record.
In 2013 and 2014, Debbie Gowling, a senior official in Ottawa's export controls division, reminded the department that there was no guarantee the sale was officially approved until permit applications were scrutinized. It is these export-permit applications that Mr. Dion approved in April.

Separately, Mr. Dion gave no indication they will reassess the deal as a result of the footage. They said Canada is concerned about wrongdoing when the incident involves Canadian-made vehicles. "The fundamental point is that this is not Canadian military equipment," they told reporters.
Mr. Mulcair pointed out that Mr. Dion has promised to cancel the Saudi deal if evidence of wrongdoing with armoured vehicles were found and suggested the minister is backing away from this pledge.
"Just a few weeks ago here in the House, Stéphane Dion stood up and said they would cancel the export permits if there was evidence that there had been human-rights abuses using that sort of equipment. It's not a question of what country that equipment was made in; it's a question how you're abusing human rights," Mr. Mulcair said.
A spokesperson for Mr. Dion said Ottawa still has no evidence to suggest Canadian equipment has been used inappropriately by Saudi Arabia, which first bought made-in-Canada armoured vehicles more than 30 years ago.
Joseph Pickerill said the Liberals plan to improve Canada's regime for screening weapons exports.
"We are working on building much more rigour into the current system," they said.

John Packer, director of the University of Ottawa's Human Rights Research and Education Centre, said the Liberals should put the Saudi deal on hold and reassess the risks Canadian vehicles may be deployed against civilians.
"Evidently, the export-control process didn't quite look at everything or not closely enough … the export should at least be put on hold pending close scrutiny and evaluation. This is an opportunity to get it right and avoid making a terrible mistake contrary to both the letter and spirit of Canadian law and to good sense."
The Saudis' use of combat machines against its Shia population goes to the very heart of the controversy over whether the Trudeau government is breaking Canada's weapons export-control rules.
The export-control regime clearly stipulates that Ottawa must not issue export permits for weapons sales to countries with poor human-rights records "unless it can be demonstrated that there is no reasonable risk that the goods might be used against the civilian population."
Responding to the video footage, Conservative foreign affairs critic Tony Clement expressed frustration on Wednesday at what they called a lack of clear information from the government on the Saudi deal.
They called for MPs to be empowered to scrutinize this contract and other exports of Canadian military equipment.

"These facts keep coming out and we can't even clear the air on them when Liberals will not give parliamentarians the information," Mr. Clement said, referring to the video footage.
The Liberals on the Commons foreign affairs committee last month used their majority to kill an NDP proposal, backed by the Conservatives, to scrutinize Canadian arms exports.
Bob Nault, the Liberal chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, declined to comment on Wednesday on whether the Trudeau government is still comfortable selling armoured vehicles to the Saudis.
"You'll have to make an appointment," they said when asked for comment by The Globe and Mail as they left caucus.
Ali Adubisi, director of the Berlin-based European-Saudi Organization for Human Rights, says Saudi authorities have deployed armoured vehicles against Shia civilians in Eastern Province more than 15 times since 2011.
(BIVN) – The Hawaii County Council voted to pass Bill 13, the polystyrene foam reduction bill, on first reading during Thursday's meeting in Hilo.
The proposed law has been floating around for years but the council has not had the votes to approve it. Puna councilwoman Eileen O'Hara took the lead in recent months to resurrect the bill. Today's vote was 7 to 2 in favor of the measure. The two Hilo councilmembers, Aaron Chung and Sue Lee Loy, voted no.
Bill 13 prohibits food vendors from dispensing prepared food in disposable polystyrene food service ware effective July 1, 2019.
The bill exempts ice chests and coolers; packaging for raw meat, fish, and eggs that have not been further processed; County facility users and food vendors with approval by the Environmental Management Director; and County facility users and food vendors procuring supplies during an event declared as an emergency by the Mayor.
The above video features the councilmember discussion that occurred after public testimony, which was once again in overwhelming support of the bill.
Big Island Video news will feature the public testimony in a coming news story.
CORRECTION: In the above video, we inadvertently identified Councilwoman Eileen O'Hara as the district 5 councilmember and Jen Ruggles as the district 4 councilmember. It should be the other way around. O'Hara serves district 4 and Ruggles serves district 5.

It's too soon to tell how the past two days of bad news have affected President Trump's numbers. Gallup's most recent daily tracking shows Trump with 38 percent job approval, although that number is both a three-day average (meaning it extends back to Sunday) and also awfully volatile.
What's worth noting, though, is that coming into this tumultuous period, Trump already had received some of the lowest approval numbers of their presidency.
We can say that because of two sets of data. The first is RealClearPolitics' average of Trump job approval polling. The second is HuffPost Pollster's collection of recent surveys.
The short version of the story? The approval average is now near the low Trump has seen during their presidency, at 39.9 percent approval. (The low was on April 3, at 39.8 percent.) What's more, they have been above 50 percent in individual polls only twice over the past two months — out of 168 polls in total. In only six of those polls have more people approved of their job performance than disapproved.
You'll notice that one of those two over-50 polls is marked as being from Politico. It's actually a Politico-Morning Consult poll. Morning Consult released new numbers Wednesday, finding that Trump's approval was at a new low for its survey, 42 percent.
What's more, the RealClearPolitics average now shows the biggest gap between those who approve and those who disapprove since Trump took office. Their approval rating is more than 15 points underwater, as they say, meaning that the percent of Americans who disapprove of the job he's doing is 15 percentage points higher than those who approve.
This is just two sets of data. FiveThirtyEight has its own tracking system that weights the quality of the poll. How's Trump doing there? Not great.
This is the highest disapproval rating we've measured for Trump so far, and close to their lowest approval rating. https://t.co/XxvWwyPbMc pic.twitter.com/giHYiWryXJ — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) May 16, 2017
Again: This is before the revelations of the past two days are fully factored in. Once they are, one of three things will necessarily happen: Their numbers will go up, will stay flat or will go down. If they go up, it's probably a sign that their argument that he's unfairly targeted is working. If it stays flat, it's probably a sign that Trump's support is down to the core that powered them through the primaries and general election. And if it goes down — which the smart money that has been so wrong lately would suggest — it may mean that Trump's core of support is eroding a bit.
And if that's the case, Republicans on Capitol Hill might start reconsidering their willingness to go to bat for the Republican in the White House.
The crime scene in Limmared, Sweden. Sources in Gaza accuse the Mossad of assassinating Mohammed Tahsin al-Bazam.
Mohammed Tahsin al-Bazam, the Palestinian and former Gaza resident who was found shot in the head in the Swedish town of Limmared on Saturday, comes from a family with ties to the Hamas militant group, Haaretz has learned. Palestinian sources in the Gaza Strip have blamed Mossad for the killing.
Their brother, Hassan Tacsin al-Bazam, was a member of Iz al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas' military wing, and served as a bodyguard for Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh.
In 2007, Hassan told the Hamas-affiliated "Palestine Now" that they were kidnapped and tortured by Fatah security services who had tried to obtain information on Haniyeh's personal security detail. Following the incident, the brother was moved to a different duty within the bodyguard unit. They were then killed in an accident in 2009.
Mohammed Tahsin al-Bazam had been living in Sweden for approximately a decade. In Palestinian media reports about their death there was no mention of their or theirs family's ties to Hamas. One of the reports however did identify them with Fatah.
Al-Bazam's ties to Hamas are evident from the Facebook profiles of their father and other family members; some also shared photographs of them holding the militant wing's flag. Al-Bazam's father, Iad al-Bazam, serves today as the spokesperson for Hamas' Homeland Security Office in Gaza.
Swedish police released a statement on Sunday about the incident in the small town of Limmared: “Reports said several people wearing masks entered the apartment through a balcony and shot the man inside. They disappeared after the shooting as quickly as they arrived,” it said.
The Fatah movement in the Gaza Strip published a statement in the Palestinian media in which it accused Israel's espionage agency of assassinating Bazam. In an interview with a Palestinian news agency, the man's father, Tahsin al-Bazam, said their son worked in marketing and was not involved in political activity.

After the shooting, Bazam was initially taken to a local hospital, but was then flown to a larger medical center in Gothenburg where they died of their injuries.
Bazam's murder has not caused much of a stir in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank, but a number of Palestinian media outlets reported the incident as a mysterious assassination.
Mitt Romney spoke out about the “phony” Donald Trump claiming the business person would be devastating the American economy and foreign relations. Romney claimed in their speech that they have no intention of running for president but refused to offer an endorsement to any of the remaining candidates. Instead, Romney pushed voters to vote for whichever candidate has the best chance of winning in a particular state. However, some have questioned if Romney is secretly planning to run for president as it was revealed that paperwork was filed with the FEC on January 31, 2016, for the “Romney For President” candidate committee.
Mitt Romney has been suggested by some to be the last ditch effort by the Republican party to oust current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. Pulling out all the stops, Romney gave a heated speech regarding why they believe that Trump is not fit to be president and urged voters to back anyone but Trump. The former presidential candidate, who infamously lost to Barack Obama in 2012, refused to endorse a particular candidate, but instead told voters to vote for whichever candidate had the best chance of beating Trump in each individual state. For example, Romney suggests voting for Rubio in Florida, John Kasich in Ohio, and for Ted Cruz or whichever one of the other two contenders has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump in the given state.
This type of rhetoric, not endorsing a particular candidate, has some questioning whether Romney could be trying to throw the Republican National Convention into a tailspin to ensure that no one candidate receives enough votes, causing the convention to be locked. CNN Politics reports that an insider close to the Mitt Romney campaign says that Romney is looking into ways to block Donald Trump at the RNC.
“It sounds like the plan is to lock the convention. Romney is focused on suppressing Trump's delegate count to prevent them from accumulating the 1,237 delegates they need to secure the nomination.”
This method is indicative of Romney's anti-Trump speech as they did not throw their support behind one candidate and instead told voters to split their votes based on who has the best chance of winning in each state. If this method is followed, none of the candidates will have enough votes to win the nomination and Romney could be first in line to come in and “save” the party in this situation by representing the party in the fall election.
This idea, easily dismissed as a conspiracy theory, may have gained a little bit of traction. A committee called “Romney For President Inc.” filed documents to run for president in 2016 with the FEC. The FEC filing was amended on January 31, 2016. The filing noted Mitt Romney as president and Paul Ryan as selected VP.
The filing shows that Romney For President has been spending money actively for legal consulting and data management. The full list of Romney's expenditures can be seen here.
Though many social media users have called an FEC filing by Romney a “sure” bet that they are running for president, it bears mentioning that practically anyone can file with the FEC without actually running. In fact, this year there are filings for Abraham Lincoln for President 2016, Dat Fat A$$, Syndeys Voluptious Buttocks and Don't Vote For Trump. Check out all of the interesting characters that have filed with the FEC under a presidential bid this year by searching the full FEC database.
Here is a list of Romney for President expenses in descending order. As you can see, Romney's campaign has been active all the way through the December 31, 2015 reporting time frame despite the politician claiming they have no intent of running for president. (Image via FEC filing/ Romney for President)
While perhaps indicative of nothing, the recent FEC filings have certainly added a new twist to the conversation. Do you think Romney is planning to make a run for the presidency at the RNC if they can block Trump from receiving enough votes for a nomination? Is Romney banking on a locked RNC? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.

Welcome to LWOS' Summer Hockey Series, Best of the Rest. Plenty of sites do a version of a 30 greats in 30 days series, but this year we are doing something a little bit different. We want to look at the best player from each team who is not in the Hockey Hall Of Fame. In order to do this there are some rules. First the player must have been a significant part of this franchise (franchises include their time in a previous city… see Winnipeg/Atlanta) and must be retired for at least 3 years, making them Hall of Fame eligible. To see all the articles in the series, check out the homepage here.
When the Florida Panthers franchise was born into the National Hockey League, president Bill Torrey and general manager Bobby Clarke had high hopes. Filling up their team with the expansion draft followed by the 1993 NHL Entry Draft, Clarke and Torrey had built a club that held the promise of being competitive. While their first two seasons weren't up to par with expectations, they did set an NHL record at the time by filling up their home arena with over 27,000 fans. Unfortunately, Eastern Conference Champions is as close as they have come to the Stanley Cup in franchise history.
The asupervisorstioned Torrey earned their Hockey Hall of Fame nod back in 1995 due in part with building the Panthers organization upon it's birth and later becoming their general manager. Roger Neilson coached two seasons in Florida but only saw one round of playoff action during their time. Pavel Bure spent four years as a Panther but their recognition as a player lies elsewhere, despite the fact that they won back-to-back Maurice Richard Trophies in 1999-00 and 2000-01 as the league's top goal scorer. Igor Larionov spent just one year with the team while Ed Belfour, Dino Ciccarelli and Joe Nieuwendyk lasted two.
Rob Niedermayer was a 5th round pick for the Florida Panthers and had all the promise in the world and a Hall of Fame tag with their name on it. Unfortunately, concussion problems got the better of Niedermayer and they went from a goal scoring winger to a defensive forward with limited offensive upside. Upon that, their major success — a Stanley Cup ring — was achieved with the Anaheim Ducks while their best run with the Panthers was their 1995-96 loss in the finals to the Colorado Avalanche.
The present holds a large amount of expectations, to the level of their arrival into the NHL. Players like Dmitri Kulikov, Jonathan Huberdeau, Alexander Barkov and the newly-drafted Aaron Ekblad all have the potential to put on Hall of Fame careers, knock on wood of course. But that is now and we are talking about players who have since retired from the game of hockey and have moved on, either to a managerial position or something entirely different. With not many choices to choose from, the Panthers selection seems like a no-brainer.
Florida Panthers – John Vanbiesbrouck
They were small, but boy could they play. John Vanbiesbrouck was a natural hybrid-style goaltender. Their butterfly style wasn't enough to cut it with their stature so they managed to blend in some stand-up attributes into the mix and thus created the perfect style for their stature. Their confident-style helped them achieve great success with both the Rangers and the Panthers and they even set some records in the Rangers camp for most assists by a goaltender in one season. Their rebound control was good, they could cover their angles and they never panicked during scrambles in their crease.
Selected 72nd overall by the New York Rangers in the 1981 NHL Entry Draft, Vanbiesbrouck had something special in him. In their first season with the OHL's Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds, Vanbiesbrouck posted a 31-16-1 record. After being drafted, The Beezer would play two more seasons — and one game with the Rangers, a 2-1 victory against the Colorado Rockies as an emergency call-up — before moving on to the Central Hockey League, playing for the Tulsa Oilers.
Tulsa was somewhat of a hectic situation at the time. The team went bankrupt and were forced to play the remainder of the 1983-84 season on the road. At one point, they were forced to practice inside a mall and even then, the team couldn't shoot pucks which meant Vanbiesbrouck was doing pirouettes after their morning stretch. That didn't stop them from doing things their own way, as they had tennis balls fired at them in the parking lot of that very same mall. Anything to get a feel for the game. Despite the hard times in Tulsa, Vanbiesbrouck led the team to the CHL Championship that year and was a co-winner of the Terry Sawchuck award, along with back-up Ron Scott, for fewest goals against in the CHL. Vanbiesbrouck was also a co-winner of the Tommy Ivan Trophy as MVP of the league, along with Bruce Affleck.
Ranger fans witnessed the true potential of Beezer in the 1985-86 season, where he'd set a career-high in wins with 31. Their glorious season continued into the playoffs as they led the Rangers past the Philadelphia Flyers in an upset. The following round, the Rangers got a good look at why that year's Washington Capitals team had registered over 100 points but again, Vanbiesbrouck stood their ground and the Rangers moved on to the Eastern Conference finals. It was there that they met their match, losing to the eventual Stanley Cup winning Montreal Canadiens. Still, their work did not go unnoticed as Vanbiesbrouck was the recipient of the Vezina Trophy and was named to the NHL's First All-Star Team that year.
After signing a three-year deal in the off-season, Vanbiesbrouck never topped their 31-win campaign, coming close with 27 wins in 56 games in the 1987-88 season and 28 wins in the same amount of games the following season. The correlation between the two is the fact that Beezer suffered two injuries over those two seasons. In the 87-88 run, during a practice no less, Vanbiesbrouck was hit with a puck underneath their mask, fracturing their lower jaw and breaking a tooth. Luckily the injury did not require their jaw to be wired shut but the following year, they were not so lucky. While working with some video equipment they had purchased to capture the life of their son, who was expected soon at that time, the glass table Beezer had been sitting on gave in and the glass broke. As they fell, Vanbiesbrouck reached back to catch their fall and in doing so they cut their ulnar nerve while also doing damage to three other nerves. The result; microsurgery to remove the glass from their wrist and repair the damage to their nerves and tendon. While the time frame was set to 4-6 months of rehab, Vanbiesbrouck returned three months later, just in time to start the Rangers pre-season camp.
The following year, head coach Roger Neilson decided to go with a rotating tandem between Vanbiesbrouck and freshly called-up Mike Richter. The two helped the team reach the playoffs and defeat the New York Islanders in the first round before bowing out to the Washington Capitals in the second round. In the 1990-91 season, the Richter-Vanbiesbrouck duo became one of the best goaltending tandems in the NHL. By the 1992-93 season, an expansion draft loomed over the NHL and the Rangers were forced to make a decision; trade Richter or Vanbiesbrouck, as the other would be liable to get drafted out of New York. The Rangers decided to go with the younger Richter, trading Vanbiesbrouck to the Vancouver Canucks for future considerations.
The move made by the Canucks was clearly strategy as they had no desire of actually keeping Vanbiesbrouck and the Florida Panthers made their first overall selection; John Vanbiesbrouck.
In the first two seasons with the Panthers, Vanbiesbrouck recorded a career-high in save percentage (.924 in their first season) but ultimately fell short by one point, missing the playoffs both years. Their 1993-94 season also included 21 wins and they were on the shortlist for both the Vezina and Hart trophies along with a Second Team NHL All-Star nod. However the season that defined Vanbiesbrouck's NHL career came in the 1995-96 season. While posting an ordinary 21-25-11 record and 2 shutouts, the numbers were not a clear indicator to just how important Vanbiesbrouck was to that Panthers team. They are, in fact, the glue that held everything together. As the season began to hit a low, it was Vanbiesbrouck's performance against the New Jersey Devils, a shutout no less, that propelled the Panthers into the playoff picture.
Defeating the Boston Bruins in five games was just their first test and the second round was an obstacle that seemed impossible; The Philadelphia Flyers. After posting a shutout in game one, Vanbiesbrouck actually held the Flyers off the scoresheet completely for a total of 116:46, back-stopping the team to a series win in six games. The next series was no walk in the park as the Panthers were heavy underdogs against Mario Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr and the Pittsburgh Penguins. After going down 3-2 in the series, the Panthers tied it up in game six and Vanbiesbrouck stopped 39 shots in game seven to give the Panthers a 3-1 win, eliminating the Penguins, much to everyone's surprise. Then… came the Colorado Avalanche. A team so stacked from top to bottom, Vanbiesbrouck couldn't have done it alone even if they had transformed into the second coming of Patrick Roy — their goaltending foe of the finals. The Panthers would go on to lose the series in four straight, but Vanbiesbrouck went out in spectacular fashion. Stopping 55 of 56 shots in the final game, it was one of the many reasons why Vanbiesbrouck finished just 3rd in voting for the Conn Smythe trophy.
The next year, Vanbiesbrouck was voted in as the starting goaltender of the All-Star Game via fan voting, with a whopping 200,457 votes, the highest in the Eastern Conference. Finishing the season with the 6th best save percentage, the 5th best goals against and 27 wins, the Panthers were eliminated by the New York Rangers in the first round of the playoffs. In the following season, Vanbiesbrouck earned their 300th win on December 27th, 1993 after the Panthers defeated the Islanders by a score of 6-2. They became the 15th goaltender to hit the milestone and just the second American-born goaltender to do so. Statistically throughout the season however, Vanbiesbrouck struggled and so did the rest of the Panthers team, finishing 12th in the Eastern Conference. This would be the last season of Vanbiesbrouck in Florida as well.
Vanbiesbrouck would go on to play with the Philadelphia Flyers for two seasons, split a season with the New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils and finally finish their career in 2001-02 with the Devils. In the two seasons with the Devils, Beezer played just 9 games combined, posting a 6-3 record while backing-up Martin Brodeur in the middle of their prime years.
On an International level, Vanbiesbrouck struggled as much as the entire US squad did during that era. A Silver medal in the 1991 Canada Cup was the best finish for Vanbiesbrouck and subsequently the only time they reached the podium. Vanbiesbrouck also appeared on the US Olympic team in the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics but they played just one minute of one game, sitting on the bench for the remainder of the tournament and watching their team end their run with a disappointing 6th place finish.
So what does Vanbiesbrouck bring to the table that would make them Hall of Fame worthy? They have no Stanley Cup ring, little international success and just one Vezina trophy. On top of that, the Trevor Daly incident which included a racial slur by Vanbiesbrouck back in Sault Ste. Marie, while they were the head coach during the 2002-03 season, has left many with a sour taste in their mouth despite a sympathetic apology on Beezer's behalf.
Well, Vanbiesbrouck does have that Vezina trophy, as previously mentioned. They have also appeared in four All-Star games and was even named Top Goaltender of the Skills Competition in 1997. Vanbiesbrouck is also just the 2nd American-born goaltender to reach 300 wins and in doing so, they were inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame back in 2007. Ranking 31st in the top 100 Ranger Greats book, Vanbiesbrouck also made an appearance on the cover of the video game NHL '97.
Vanbiesbrouck also currently holds the Rangers all-time franchise records for most assists in a single season by a goaltender with 5 and most career assists by a goaltender with 25. On top of that, Vanbiesbrouck is the most winningest goaltenders among those born in America with 374 career victories and also leads all American-born in the shutout category with 40 career donuts. For Hall voters who like to acknowledge national contributions, that can certainly help their case.
Their career wasn't pretty, far from it, but what Vanbiesbrouck did for the Florida Panthers organization during their four year stay is astronomical. They inspired hope during their Stanley Cup run and gave Panthers fans something to cheer for through the aches and pains of being the new guy in the big town that is the NHL. Is it enough to get them in the Hall of Fame at any point in their life? They have it in tough but eventually, we should see the best player to ever wear the number 34 in the Hall of Fame.

For months on end Cinema City Jerusalem demanded that a contracted taxi company send only Jewish drivers for some of its workers. When the company refused, the megaplex cut its ties. An investigative by our Hebrew site, Local Call, in cooperation with ‘Ulpan Shishi,' Channel 2's flagship news broadcast.
By Yael Marom
“If they want a Jewish driver, she'll get a Jewish driver, I don't understand what difference it makes.”
“The two of them just asked for a Jewish driver.”
“A woman needs to make it to Mevaseret Zion, I would like a Jewish driver to come pick them up.”
“One must ask gently and diplomatically for a Jewish driver for the girls.”
These were the words the manager and shift manager at Jerusalem's Cinema City used when talking to the ride coordinator of the taxi company that drove movie theater workers home at night (the company employs both Jewish and Arab workers). The discriminatory demands were made in recorded phone conversations, as well as by special vouchers that had the words “Jewish driver” written on them, for which Cinema City paid a high price. Local Call was able to get a hold of both the recordings and the vouchers, which are now being exposed for the first time in a special investigative report that conducted in cooperation with “Ulpan Shihi,” the flagship weekend news program on Israel's Channel 2.
After a long period of time in which the ride organizer at the cab company tried to object to Cinema City's discriminatory and racist demand, which directly affected the livelihoods of Arab taxi drivers, a senior manager at the movie theater threatened that Cinema City would cut its ties with the company — a threat that eventually became reality.
According to Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation as well as Israel's Equal Opportunities Law, discriminating against workers due to their origin, nationality or religion is strictly forbidden.
A Jewish driver is part of the service
At the end of February 2014, Jerusalem's glitzy Cinema City, which includes 19 movie theaters and a small shopping mall, opened to the public. The “A. Mor Hasaot” transportation company won the tender to provide taxis for approximately 20 workers. The company provided nine permanent drivers for the job — three of them Jewish and six of them Arabs from East Jerusalem.
Thair Raga, a 36-year-old cab driver from East Jerusalem, was appointed to be in charge of coordinating the night rides according to the demands made by the Cinema City shift managers. “We got used to the workers, the drivers were nice, there was no problem, everything worked well,” they say.
But three months after the complex opened, three Jewish teenagers were kidnapped and murdered in the West Bank, followed by the kidnapping and murder of Muhammad Abu Khdeir from Jerusalem's Shuafat neighborhood, there was a military operation in the West Bank and a war in Gaza. War, fear and hate flooded the streets of Jerusalem.
And then everything changed. The workers at Cinema City began saying they were afraid of Arab drivers and demanded that only Jewish drivers take them home. “Everything was fine until the war began in the summer,” says Raga. “The female workers began to get scared, and then it turned into a phenomenon whereby the workers were demanding a Jewish driver, and Cinema City requires us to meet those demands, since it is part of the service. At first I told myself that we would make it work for the time being, since the situation was very difficult in Jerusalem and there are Jewish drivers in the company, and then it would pass. But it didn't pass.”
According to Raga, when the workers began to feel that their demands for “Jewish drivers” were not being honored, they told the Cinema City management that they would go on strike, and some of them even threatened to quit.
Raga began receiving more and more requests for a “Jewish driver.” “The shift managers would call and demand a Jewish driver, but would do it out of shame,” they said. “At first they would say a specific name of a Jewish driver that they want, so that they wouldn't hurt my feelings or have to say outright that they want a Jewish driver.”
What about the rest of the Arab drivers? How did they react to this demand?
“I found myself between a rock and hard place, between Arab drivers to whom I owe an explanation, and the Cinema City management. In the end, I had to explain to them, and they were obviously upset. Sometimes I had to tell the other drivers: ‘Guys, it's going to be a shift full of racists today, there is no work left for us'.”
10 percent extra per Jewish driver
The summer ended, the war came to an end, Jerusalem calmed down, but for some of the workers at Cinema City, it became acceptable to refuse to ride with an Arab driver. They continued to demand Jewish taxi drivers — a celebration of racism that directly harmed the Arab drivers' livelihood, and led to higher costs for the company, which was forced to contract Jewish drivers, who do not regularly work with the company, in order to provide the service to the workers.
As 2014 came to a close, Raga decided that they were no longer willing to remain silent. “The situation in Jerusalem calmed down, and I began opposing the policy. I told them that the next diver in line would take the workers, and that it doesn't matter if its Chaim or Ahmad.”
Raga tried to talk to the managers and workers at Cinema City about the issue. On February 19 of this year, Merav Basher, one of the top managers and a representative of the owners of Cinema City Jerusalem, sent an email to the workers in which they gave guidelines for conduct vis-a-vis the cab company. In it they wrote:
“It is important to be sensitive to the issue of Arab/Jewish drivers. After the HaPisga cab company was fined for a request for a Jewish driver by a client, the Transportation Ministry is checking all the cab companies. One must ask in a gentle and diplomatic fashion for a Jewish driver for the girls.” They also named Raga as someone who is “causing trouble.”
The only thing that really occurred in the wake of Raga's attempts was that the workers understood that Jewish drivers would cost more. And so, toward the end of February, Basher and the manager of A. Mor Hasaot held a meeting, during which it was agreed that Cinema City would pay 10 percent more (on top of the pre-established cost) for a Jewish driver.
In order to keep track, the vouchers for ordering a driver would be marked to show that they were for Jewish drivers. “I told them that I want to differentiate from a Jewish driver from a regular one on the bill. They asked me whether to require two signatures or write ‘Jewish driver,' and I asked that they write down that the driver was Jewish. They agreed,” Raga tells me as they smile victoriously. It is obvious to them that the only reason anyone will believe them is because they recorded the conversations. From that moment on, they began demanding that the shift managers call them on the phone in order to make the order, and recorded them, one after another, as they clearly request a ‘Jewish driver.'”
On March 9, Raga decided to confront Basher once again and recorded their conversation. Throughout the conversation they explain to Basher that even workers who do not ride alone with the driver are demanding to be driven only by a Jew. Basher didn't seem too fazed: “Thair, it is possible that sometimes you order a cab for someone, and then it is decided to add more people to ride along with them If they want a Jewish driver, there will be a Jewish driver, what difference does it make? I don't understand.”
Raga insisted that the cost of a Jewish driver would be much higher, especially if the driver will be making a number of stops. Basher responded: “But this is the situation. If it doesn't work for you, we can go our separate ways. What difference does the number of stops make?” and added, “I don't see a problem with any of this. It doesn't matter to me whether the driver is Jewish, Circassian, Christian or Spanish. It doesn't matter to me. As long as the driver makes as many stops as they are asked to.”
Raga told Basher about an incident in which one of the workers refused to ride in their cab, since they want “one of ours,” and explained how it made them feel. “It was as if I was trash. And you're supporting them. That's how you are treating me, Merav, and it hurts me personally,” reminding them that they have been working with them since Cinema City's opening day. Basher promised to take care of the issue. Instead, they continued to support the demands of the workers, justified their fear and emphasized the need to provide them with a sense of security.
Two days later, on March 11, Raga called Yaniv Turgeman, the CEO of Cinema City Jerusalem and demanded they get involved and put an end to the discrimination. This conversation was also recorded. Turgeman, who only “barely heard” about “this nonsense,” said that they “told Merav and you should tell everyone that this is unacceptable,” while on the other hand said that in the case that there is a Jewish driver, and this is what the workers want, this is what they must receive.
On March 23, after midnight, Basher called Raga. “Listen, I have a problem. I have a woman who needs to get to Mevaseret Zion. I want a Jewish driver to come pick them up,” they demanded. Raga explained that they had no Jewish drivers available, and that a Jewish driver from another station will want cash for their services.
Basher responded: “There is nothing I can do, nothing. I need this. I cannot send this woman to ride in fear. If not, I will let them take a cab and pay them back tomorrow. This is part of the service that you are supposed to give me.” Basher became angry over the fact that there was a lack of Jewish drivers that night, threatening Raga: “I am putting an end to this tomorrow. I don't have the energy. I'm moving to a different company. Egged [an Israeli transportation company] will provide me with three people a night.”
When shame is too much to bear
On Sunday, May 3, Merav announced that Cinema City would be immediately cutting ties with A. Mor Hasaot.
I have been listening to Raga's recordings for weeks. One recording followed by another. Friendly conversations that always reach that inevitable moment in which the shift manager must openly use the words “Jewish driver.” The shame in their voices is too much to bear. From the conversations with them, it is clear that they understand that the policy is racist and hurtful, but none of them did anything about it.
During one of my meetings with Raga I asked them why he, too, didn't remain silent, especially after coming to terms with the personal price they would be forced to pay. Many others would have just put aside their pride and moved on.
“First of all, it's me. I don't know how to shut up,” they say. “I pay my taxes. I do everything this country demands of me. I don't turn my back. So why is it that when I deserve to be treated like a human being I need to take a step back?”
‘Unsatisfactory service'
This investigative report is a result of a joint effort by our Hebrew site, Local Call, and “Ulpan Shishi,” the flagship weekend news program on Israel's Channel 2. Channel 2 asked Cinema City to respond to the entire affair. The following is their full response:
“The company's work was terminated over professional differences alone, without any relation to the [ethnic] origin of the company drivers. Cinema City, both in Jerusalem and across the country, employs Arabs in a range of different positions, including management. Thus, the claims of racism and discrimination do not reflect the reality and certainly not the values of Cinema City.
“Due to continual professional dissatisfaction that stemmed, among other things, from dropping off workers at the wrong addresses, as well as significant tardiness of drivers in picking up workers and unsatisfactory service on their part, it was decided to switch to a different company. It must be stated that there is an additional reason for switching companies, although we are unable to reveal the reason for privacy reasons.
“We must emphasize that today, Egged provides rides to the workers in Jerusalem, and the service is provided by both Jewish and Arab drivers. Unfortunately, A. Mor chose to seek revenge on Cinema City after the latter ended the contract through false and biased claims.”
The response was formulated by the office of PR king Rani Rahav. The response only confirms the fact that Cinema City did exactly what Basher threatened to do in their conversation with Raga, and began working with a different company. The “satisfactory” service was, in effect, providing Jewish drivers on demand. Raga refused to provide this service.

The Isla Vista Foot Patrol will suspend action to implement earlier quiet hours on weekends after receiving swift disapproval at a community town hall Tuesday.
The current noise ordinance restricts “any loud and unreasonable noise” after midnight on Friday and Saturday, and students from UC Santa Barbara and Santa Barbara City College who live in I.V. have long butted heads with its strict enforcement.
The IVFP proposed last week that quiet hours would be shifted to 10 p.m. on weekends and received immediate criticism from dozens of residents. After hearing over two hours of public comment at student-lead town hall Tuesday, the IVFP decided to delay the final approval from Sep. 13 to a later date that is yet to be determined.
The Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors is implementing the change throughout the county to align unincorporated areas with their surrounding cities, which already abide by a 10 p.m. weekend ordinance. Isla Vistans, however, insist that the town requires a specifically tailored approach.
The ordinance would affect all unincorporated areas in Santa Barbara county, including I.V., Hope Ranch, Montecito and the “Noleta” area between Goleta and Santa Barbara.
IVFP Lieutenant Ruben Cintron presented the change on August 11 at a monthly public meeting. But on Tuesday, Sirapat Cupradinan, a fourth-year chemistry major, claimed “most of us in this room did not hear about this until less than 48 hours ago.”
Their sentiment echoed several other speakers; this was not the first time that locals have felt blindsided by important changes in I.V. In early June, parents and students gathered at a public town hall hosted by the university to speak out against construction at the intersection of El Colegio Road and Storke Road.
“We were just as surprised as everyone else that nobody knew about this,” responded Kelly Moore, a commander of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. They attributed the late notice to personnel changes, saying they and Cintron were newly assigned to the case.
Supporting the new ordinance, they claimed it would increase safety in the town by targeting “what happens as a result of parties.” Crime continues in the summer when UCSB and SBCC students are not present, they said, and sexual assaults are a recurring problem.
Dwayne Moseby, UCIV liaison for the A.S. Public Safety Commission, countered that there has been a 20 percent decrease in crime from 2013 to 2015, citing an April report from the county district attorney office. They said I.V. experienced record-low crime rates on days “alternative programs” like UCIV were active.
“By having this new ordinance, it's almost hindering, or say, a slap to the face, for these programs which have been developing the whole time,” they said.
Several locals are also concerned that the change will hurt I.V. businesses that cater to a late-night crowd. Miguel Aceves and Sara Cho, who work at I.V. Deli Mart, say the business will suffer if students begin ending their nights early. The grocery store and fast-food joint closes at 3 a.m. during the school year, and Cho says “rush hour” begins around 12:20 a.m. every night.
The IVFP has not looked into the ordinance's effect on local businesses, but Moore said “economics takes second hand to safety” when considering how laws will interact with residents over an extended period of time.
A burgeoning self-governance movement in I.V. hopes to close the gap between Isla Vistans and law enforcement. Darcel Elliott, campaign manager for the Yes on E & F self-governance campaign, says similar miscommunications have “happened continuously” in their time in I.V. and the Community Services District (CSD) could increase regular communication.
The “disturbing the peace” law in California allows the IVFP to shut down loud parties only after receiving a police report from another resident. If quiet hours have begun, however, they can put an end to any gathering that is producing noise 100 feet from its property line.
“We're not saying don't party,” Moore said. “We're just asking you to do it quietly.”
The ordinance, if passed, has the potential to change music, nightlife and college culture in I.V., but not all residents are convinced that the law is a pressing issue.
UCSB student Jordan Mitchell said many of the “entitled-ass” audience members were worrying about their nightlife rather than what they consider more pressing issues, such as the death of a student last year or “racism that's been happening on campus.”
“There a lot of things that need to be changed,” they said. “Y'all now decide to get together?”

As an independent engineer and sole proprietor, I don't have a team I can delegate tasks to. Everything from product design to taking out the trash rests on the shoulders of the guy at the top. That means producing more than 10 units at a time is outside the scope of what I alone can handle. Prototypes can be hand soldered, hit with the hot air pencil, or–if you're really fancy–run through the reflow oven. Note: the “reflow oven” may or may not have been a toaster oven in a previous life…
Production runs are starkly different from prototyping and require automation. A good process will churn out exceptionally complicated designs from a well specified set of plans. Match that with the experience of board assembly troubleshooting and the likelihood of success goes up. The automation and expertise lies in the hands of people that do these tasks every day: the Contract Manufacturer (CM).
Contract Manufacturer Export Files
The first thing you'll discover as you start talking with different CMs is that each wants a different subset of your design documents. Some are happy to accept EDA files (say a .brd file instead of gerber files). Some want all the gerber layers and a BOM. Some might want that BOM in CSV format, but it will vary between those that want it in tab delimited vs Excel native format. If they're feeling really froggy, they'll ask for a placement file (with the same formatting requests). The trick to this, is having a single source that generates all your design output. Look deep into your EDA tool of choice, and work out a way for you to store every last bit of component information in there that you can. It's already the central repository for the design and layout information, make it the centralized source for all your parts requirements too.
Why is centralized management important for parts? Because Contract Manufacturers will impose changes on you based on their in house inventory and their pick-n-place (PnP) capabilities. As an independent designer, the in house inventory at the CM becomes important, because they are buying at far greater volume than I ever can. Chances are, they have my 0.1uF bypass caps already loaded onto a PnP reel. If it's already loaded onto the reel, they might cut me a deal on the setup costs, and I'm certainly going to get a cost savings because of their purchase power on those common parts.
What if that part is a different footprint size? I standardize on 0805–because I know I can solder those on my prototypes–but many CMs stock 0603 sizes. When you make that change to your PCB, it would be great if that change was automatically made throughout all your design files, including the BOM. That's why you want to keep everything inside the EDA. When you export, you have the latest and greatest values for everything from technical spec to footprint.
Keeping Everything Organized
When you finally do get to the point of pushing the “Make My Widget” button, you might have to start dealing with higher quantity parts sourcing. Many CMs will offer to do this for you, but there are costs associated with it. In some cases, they will ask you to source and supply the parts instead. Smaller CMs do not have the manpower to do all of the sourcing for you.
If you'll be sourcing the components, ask your CM if you can have the distributor drop-ship the components to them. In that case you'll need to work out very carefully what sort of information you want on the component packaging: value, footprint, reference designator and an internal part number are most likely the minimum they'll require. If they don't accept a drop shipment, you'll need to track everything as it comes in from your vendors. The box from Digi-Key. The box from Avnet. That other box with small components from a past build. Your BOM is 45 parts long and everything starts looking the same. Get well acquainted with a label maker and don't let a single thing out of the box until you've got a solid documentation and tracking strategy in place. I use 2″ x 4″ shipping labels printed with the project name, project number, CM quote number (or whatever reference they supply), schematic reference, description, type, value and footprint size. One of those for every item on the BOM, and as soon as I take the bag out of the box, the label goes on. For parts in tubes, wrap a piece of paper tightly around it and use two stickers back to back on the long edge. Making it easy to get the assembly equipment set up will help ensure a friendly relationship with your CM.
Essentially, as an independent, working with a CM demands that you be flexible, but detailed. You might not be inclined to do so after having lived with your design for so long. However, mistakes can make a huge impact to your product schedule and the end product quality. The Contract Manufacturer is your business partner, and while it is their job to deliver your product on spec at the quoted price, you need to be prepared for the variety of demands and the changes imposed by that partnership.
ROTTERDAM, Netherlands - Marianne Vorthoren sits in their bright sunlit office, sharing a plate of biscuits made by a local woman for a community forum the night before.  They are open, and quick to smile – but they are also cautious. “We are not the Muslim intelligence agency,” they assert.
“Of course we feel a shared responsibility to protect our youngsters. But I am very strict. We don't want to be involved in reporting people for acting suspiciously. That's up to the authorities."
Vorthoren finds themselves in a difficult position. A convert to Islam, they now direct the Platform for Islamic Organisations in Rijnmond (SPIOR), based in the Dutch city port of Rotterdam. It is a prestigious role that they are passionate about – but as they attempt to strengthen the organisation's community work, the Dutch government is demanding Muslim leaders provide more information about that community.
The Netherlands has been praised across Europe for anti-radicalisation strategies which emphasise community dialogue. Aimed mainly at the country's Muslim minority (around four percent of the population), their focus has been on local initiatives implemented by municipalities, rather than those handed down from national government.

But the country has also led strategies intended to increase co-operation and information-sharing across the continent.
For several months, top intelligence officials from 30 European countries have secretly met every week in the Netherlands to share information on suspects, including children as young as nine.
Following recent bloodshed on European soil, security agencies are under pressure both to foil attacks before they occur and to halt the murky process that comes before, known as “radicalisation”.
Amid warnings about further attacks and a spike in far-right support across Europe, some - like Vorthoren - fear that the Dutch government wants to co-opt community leaders, thereby alienating already marginalised groups.
“The essential ingredient is trust within communities. If you also have a reputation for seeking out potential suspects, that will be impossible,” said Vorthoren.
They listed the challenges for trust-building: laws that allow dual nationals to be stripped of Dutch citizenship if they are suspected of planning to join groups like Islamic State or al-Qaeda - even if they have not been convicted of any crime by a court; the threat of losing a passport to prevent travel; even the risk of having their children taken away.
“This makes it complex,” said Vorthoren, “because people fear that if they report [worrying behaviour], their loved one's children will be taken away. We have told the government this, but there is tension. There is always tension between prevention and repression – that's why organisations have to be very clear about their role.”
Vorthoren said that they understood that sometimes strict measures have to be put in place. “It's just a question of how they are implemented.”

Preventing 'a kind of Detroit'
Less than a two-hour train ride from the Belgian capital Brussels, which teems with heavily-armed police, an atmosphere of calm prevails in Amsterdam. Half an hour south, the cosmopolitan port city of Rotterdam maintains the same aura of muted bustle, with barely a law enforcement official to be seen.
It is the most international city in the Netherlands, with nearly half its population born outside the country and nationals from at least 170 different states.
But it is a city that also comes with inequality built in: most housing projects south of the River Maas, just across the water from Rotterdam's financial north, were built to house migrant workers for the port. Districts in the south still bear the names of former Dutch colonies.
Cramped conditions in the city's south led to race riots in the 1970s, primarily between Dutch citizens and immigrants from Morocco and Turkey, two of the largest non-Dutch communities.
Since then, authorities have fought to keep Rotterdam's south side, where the number of families relying on state benefits is double the average, from becoming “a kind of Detroit,” as one social housing official described it recently.

Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb, the first Muslim mayor of a major European city, has won near-universal praise since taking on the job in 2009 for projects focusing on community inclusion.
Famous for telling Dutch extremists who “turn against freedom” to “f*** off” after last year's Charlie Hebdo attacks, Aboutaleb usually prefers a more nuanced approach. Under their flight attendantship, municipal employees meet citizens at fortnightly forums, small businesses are required to set aside jobs for local people and co-operative kitchens have appeared in areas which many had consigned to the scrapheap.
Cohesion projects at risk
But life is far from untroubled – and members of Rotterdam's 100,000-strong Muslim community tell Middle East Eye that cohesion projects risk being sabotaged by increasingly intrusive information-gathering within those groups. Division and discrimination, they say, are on the rise.
According to Bart Schuurman, a researcher at Leiden University's Centre for Terrorism and Counter-terrorism, the situation has changed since changes were brought in by central government in late 2015.
“Radicalisation is a hot topic for many government agencies,” they told MEE, “and there is now more co-ordination between them.
“The police, the municipalities, the secret services and community leaders might all get together to discuss certain individuals. A community leader might then visit the family [of an individual that authorities are concerned about].
“This is often done in a pre-criminal phase – it may not be somebody who is directly involved [in criminal activity], but an individual who has said something that is a cause for concern at school, for example.”
The 'Young Imam'
One key backer of this new integrated and more intrusive approach is Yassin Elforkani, 34, a preacher and until last year head of the CMO, the statutory body that oversees the running of more than 380 mosques in the Netherlands. Elforkani has urged the government to strengthen its counter-terror strategies, and warned earlier this year that an attack would hit Amsterdam within six months, telling the Danish press that “the terrorist networks are ready”.
“Many people in the communities know about terrorist networks but choose to keep their mouths shut to protect young people,” says the 34-year-old dubbed the “Young Imam” by sympathetic newspapers and seen by many as the fresh face of moderate Islam in the Netherlands.

Though Elforkani is an opponent of political Islam in all its forms, they did publicly oppose the government's 2014 plan, later shelved, to ban all organisations with a link to a loosely defined Salafism. However, many of the young imam's other outspoken statements have made them a controversial figure within the communities they represented as head of the CMO.
One young Muslim, who asked to be identified only as Farid, told MEE that Elforkani is seen as a “collaborator” by many after insisting that Islam has a problem, and must reform in the face of the rise groups like Islamic State. Elforkani stepped down as head of the CMO last June after reportedly receiving threats.
Yet at a community forum in Rotterdam one year on, Elforkani cuts a charismatic and confident figure, their energy seemingly undampened by recent challenges.
Wearing a sharp suit, they stride around the hall at Essalam Mosque, one of the biggest in Western Europe and certainly the largest in the Netherlands. The centre, which has goalposts in the courtyard and hosts diabetes screenings and legal advice surgeries along with the usual prayer services, is holding a debate on “Alienation and Religiosity.”
Elforkani is chairing the event and thunders to an assembled audience of local residents: "We need more positive role models of Islam.
Reaching out to Muslim converts
Stefanie Danopoulos, the only woman in the Netherlands to chair a mosque, runs the Middenweg Centre. “The government likes Yassin Elforkani,” they tell MEE, “because they are educated and speaks about moderate Islam.”
The centre, whose name translates as “Middle Way” in English, is in a modern church conversion in the centre of Rotterdam, with clean lines and the old stained-glass window still intact. During Ramadan, Muslims and non-Muslims gather each evening to break the fast together. Middenweg focuses on reaching out to converts to Islam, who Danopoulos says often find themselves isolated from their families and mainstream society.

“It's difficult to convert,” said Danopoulos, who themselves converted more than 15 years ago. “With your family you feel like a stranger, even if they accept you. And other people call converts land betrayers – they are afraid of change.”
Converts are also an area of focus for government agencies attempting to stamp out forms of Islam seen as unacceptable. Research shows that converts are generally over-represented among people who have travelled from western Europe to fight in Iraq or Syria: for the Netherlands, up to 18 percent of the 230 people who have gone abroad to fight are thought to be converts, even though converts account for less than two percent of the Dutch Muslim population.
As a result, the government has made converts one of six target groups for a national anti-radicalisation strategy that is currently out to tender for Muslim-led organisations.
Some of Danopoulos's volunteers have been called in for training by Rotterdam security officials. “There will be training on what we might see, what to do when we see it,” they said. “I told them that this is what we're already doing. I told them: ‘We are doing your work.'
“They laughed.”
'They can make you but they can break you'
Fostering dialogue is becoming ever more difficult thanks to new restrictions on preachers visiting the country to speak.
Essalam Mosque faced controversy last October when it invited Egyptian preacher-born Fadil Soliman to give a talk. The discussion was titled “The IS delusion”: Soliman described being spat at and having a chair thrown at them by a fellow Muslim for saying that 9/11 was unjustifiable within Islam. But much local media coverage overlooked the topic of the talk, instead branding Soliman a “hate sheikh” with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and a penchant for chopping off hands.
“Of course Soliman is against IS,” said Danopoulos, “and it's good for young people to hear that from him. But they called them a hate imam.
“Now you have to ask for a form and get permission to invite [a preacher from abroad]. It takes six weeks and they check how much people earn. They are making it very difficult – and in the end they can still just say that the preacher cannot come."
Danopoulos says the atmosphere has become so tense that the Middenweg Centre, along with other mosques and religious centres, makes audio recordings of everything that goes on, in case anyone disputes what has been said by preachers or participants.
The centre, originally bought and renovated with funding from Qatar, now runs solely on funding from users. Danopoulos says it is possible for projects working with the Muslim community to get government money, but it is a risky venture.
“They have to know everything. And that's exactly what I don't want - they can make you but they can break you too. It's risky to be dependent, especially at the moment.
“I just don't understand why they are doing this,” said Danopoulos, shaking their head. “They will create a very big gulf between Muslims and non-Muslims. If the government behaves like this, it only furthers divisions. Our idea is to come together.”

Injustice and Islamphobia
For Vorthoren, the increasingly divisive atmosphere is making it near impossible to carry out the real community work they see as key to tackling the root causes of alienation and extremism. In the shadow of the government's single-minded focus on its anti-radicalisation agenda, they say, projects like a community garden outside the Essalam Mosque – which brings together local residents and young children – are finding it difficult to attract attention.
“Prevention doesn't just mean telling people that killing others is wrong. It's about abstract things: it also means addressing injustice and a sense of injustice.
“Young people we speak to are very quick to say that what Islamic State is doing is wrong. The thing that is most talked about, though, is injustice within this society - Islamophobia is a really big issue,” they said.
They pointed to a report published by SPIOR in May that found that, though reported incidents of discrimination in the region had fallen 25 percent since the start of 2015, the number of incidents targeting Muslims and particularly Muslim women, had doubled.
“If you don't address that injustice adequately, that feeling can be abused by extremists as a recruiting tool. It's about a sense of belonging.
“When people say there is an easy answer to this issue, I just don't trust them."

Theresa May tonight launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump minutes before a face-to-face meeting with the US President.
The Prime Minister railed against their decision to pull America out of the Paris climate change deal and blasted nations which erect trade barriers and pursue protectionism.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mrs May issued slap downs to Mr Trump, Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
Leaders who fail to respect international agreements risk jeopardising faith in institutions, they warned.
Delivering a thinly-veiled rebuke to the US President, they said climate change “is depleting and degrading the planet we leave to our children”.
And the PM hit out at countries which try to stifle global trade, after Mr Trump's “America first” inauguration speech in January.
They warned against moves which “undermine support for the forces of liberalism and free trade that have done so much to propel global growth”.

Inequality was “pushing some countries towards protectionism in the belief that this best defends the interests of their own people”, they claimed.
Mrs May added: “If this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global co-operation that will damage the interests of all our peoples.
“So those of us who hold true to our shared values - who hold true to that desire to defend the rules and high standards that have shaped and protected the world we live in - need to strive harder than ever to show that institutions like this United Nations can work for the countries that formed them, and for the people who we represent.”
They called on nations to ensure “that those who flout the rules and spirit of our international system are held to account; that nations honour their responsibilities and play their part in upholding and renewing a rules-based international order that can deliver prosperity and security for us all”.
The PM added: “As the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by states deliberately flouting – for their own gain -the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security.”

In a wide-ranging speech, Mrs May issued a damning assessment of the UN, saying that “throughout its history the UN has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery”.
The 193-member body has a "regular" annual budget of $2.7billion (£2billion), as well as spending $7.3billion (£5.4billion) on peacekeeping, more than $15billion (£11billion) on development, and over $14billion (£10.3billion) on humanitarian action.
It sends 100,000 peacekeepers to 13 missions.
This year the UK will pump £90million into the regular Budget, make £2billion in voluntary contributions, and provide 700 peacekeepers.
But Mrs May threatened to split cash from UN programmes that fail to produce results.
Demanding sweeping reforms to the crisis-hit 72-year-old institution, they said: “The UN and its agencies must win our trust by proving to us and the people we represent that they can deliver.
“That is why we will remain generous in our funding but set aside 30% to be paid only to those parts of the UN that achieve sufficient results.”
They also urged China not to block UN efforts to bring North Korea to heel.
Warning of the “immediate, global danger” posed by Kim Jong-un as they continue to develop a nuclear bomb, which has tipped the region towards the brink, Mrs May told world leaders: “Time after time they have shown contempt for the international community of law abiding states, contempt for their neighbours, and contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security.”

The PM praised UN attempts to clamp down on Pyongyang, but added: “Unless all Security Council members continue to live up to the special responsibilities that are placed upon us and, in seeking to resolve this crisis, be prepared to take all necessary measures to tackle this threat, we will not be able to bring stability to the Korean peninsula.”
Beijing stands accused of watering down sanctions against the pariah state, and has faced mounting pressure to rein in Kim.
But the dictator continues to press for a nuke, believing it will protect them from any US-backed bids to topple their regime.
Mrs May also delivered a slap down to Vladimir Putin, who has not attended the Assembly.
Without naming Russia, they accused Moscow of blocking key Security Council resolutions over Syria.
“One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the last five years as in the whole of the second half of the Cold War – and in so doing they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons,” they said.
Meeting at New York's Lotte Palace Hotel, Mr Trump and Mrs May shook hands and sat in front of US and UK flags, with a small coffee table with flowers on it between them.
Speaking in their home city, The President said: "It's great to have Prime Minister May from the UK and their representatives who are people who we know very well.

"We will be doing a lot of trading with the United Kingdom and we look
forward to it.
"We've gotten to know each other over the last period of a year and it's a real honour to have you here."
The PM said: "It's good to be here and as you say we've had many discussions between our representatives and ourselves on a whole variety of issues, including trade, which is important for us, and some other policy issues and our security and defence relationship which of course is the closest we have."
Weird local and federal laws often hold up new technology in cars, like the NHTSA's quirky headlight and mirror laws holding up Audi's Matrix LEDs and LCD mirrors. In New York, autonomous cars have a battle of their own as a 35-year-old law is preventing automakers from testing them on city streets, according to AutoBlog.
The law in question isn't actually that strange—in fact, we're surprised New York is the only state to have it on the books. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the steering wheel at all times, and would still be a perfectly reasonable rule in a world without autonomous functionality. Audi was unpleasantly surprised by the law's existence when it showed up in state capital Albany with a self-driving car it couldn't legally demonstrate.
Luckily, autonomous vehicles have one lawmaker on their side in New York Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Joseph Robach. They not only wants to change the law to match today's technology, but they also feel it needs to be changed as it could result in police officers ticketing drivers for using today's assisted parking system and limited autonomous driving capacities, like Tesla's Autopilot.
To date, six states and D.C. have modified their outdated driving laws to accommodate self-driving cars, but New York's other lawmakers aren't quite convinced this technology is ready for the streets of the Empire State. These laws will get changed at some point, but exactly when remains up in the air.
For those interested in the closest thing we have to autonomous driving right now, there is the Tesla Model S. Shoppers looking to lease can snag a 2016 Model S 70 with optional Autopilot software from $866 for 36 months with $6,561 due at signing (10,000 mi/yr).
Tom Clancy , the insurance agent turned superpower-thriller novelist, died yesterday at the age of 66, leaving behind a legacy that includes blockbuster books (more than 100 million copies of their books in print), movies, even video games. Although they didn't set down a list of writing tips for posterity–or at least, if they did, it's still stealthily unrevealed–through interviews and lectures, Clancy offered advice that can be applied to any style of writing.
Tell the story.
“Fundamentally, I think of myself as a storyteller, not a writer.” What's the difference, you may ask? Instead of trying to impress critics with their literary pyrotechnics, Clancy said they told stories to “take people away from driving trucks or fixing toilets or whatever they do, away from their drudgery. That's a good enough purpose for any man.” Clancy's career really took off when a man not known for being a member of the literati, then-President Ronald Reagan, labeled Clancy's first book, The Hunt for Red October, a “perfect yarn.”
Writing is like golf.
“A lot of people think [when you write] something mystical happens to you, that maybe the muse kisses you on the ear. But writing isn't divinely inspired–it's hard work.” Clancy advises writers to “learn to write the same way you learn to play golf. You do it, and keep doing it until you get it right.”
Make pretend more real than real.
“The difference between fiction and reality? Fiction has to make sense,” Clancy said. Denied military service because of severe nearsightedness, Clancy nevertheless fostered top-level military contacts. “He is welcomed aboard jets and submarines and permitted to ride in tanks to their heart's delight,” wrote one reporter. “I hang my hat on getting as many things right as I can,” said Clancy. “I've made up stuff that's turned out to be real–that's the spooky part.” Nothing perhaps more spooky than their 1994 novel Debt of Honor which ends with a Boeing 747 purposefully crashing into the Capitol during a joint session of Congress, foreshadowing 9/11.
Just three months after the birth of their second daughter, skateboarder Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana is planning to be back in action in time for the Nitro Circus U.S. Tour dates, alongside their husband, Travis Pastrana, and with baby Bristol and their toddler big sister, Addy, in tow. Some people do life, and parenting, just a bit differently. GrindTV caught up with the matriarch of the Nitro Circus for their perspective on both.
As I was preparing for this interview, I happened to hear this amazing story on NPR about high-wire walker Jenny Wallenda, the “Matriarch of the ‘Flying Wallendas' Circus Family,” who died last week at the age of 87. Them family's circus roots stretch back into the 1800s, and, their grandson Nik Wallenda has been keeping the legacy alive with their world-record high-wire performances.
I love that, and I can see how it becomes a family thing like that. Addy's already so stoked on everything action sports, and I imagine she'll continue to have that passion all their life just like we will. I mean, can you imagine growing up in the circus, much less the Nitro Circus? For our daughters, that's just life, and it's completely amazing to me to think about it.
You got into skateboarding very early on, and I remember you winning your first medals at X Games when you were about 14. In some ways, that's not so different from growing up in a circus.
I have a picture of me standing on a board with my dad holding my hands when I was about Addy's age. Our parents got us skateboards for Easter! Later on, when I was about 6, my older brother got me a membership to the local skatepark, and then around 10 or 11 it really hit me. That's when I learned how to drop in on vert, and that was it: I was hooked for life. Addy's one-and-a-half now, but already she'll lay on it and push around. They love to have me hold onto them and skate, and I like to bring the girls to the skatepark to let them watch the skaters so they get it in their little brains that it's not some big scary thing. One of the most important things you can do as a parent is just to expose your kids to fun!
What do you love most about raising your kids around the Nitro Circus? We have so many people around that Addy loves, and they're all going to be an influence on their life and the person they become. It will be the same for Bristol as they get older, I imagine. It takes a village. It really does. And we have one hell of a village!
How did you first get involved in all of this, with the Nitro Circus? Initially it was just something new, something awesome to do. X Games had just taken women's vert out, and we literally had no events. It gave me an outlet to continue to skate as my job and have fun doing it with my then-boyfriend Travis. Later they proposed to me at a Nitro Circus event, and then we got married and now we have kids and it's all amazing. For me the coolest thing now is that we get to do this as a family.

How challenging has it been to have kids along for this ride?
I always wanted to be a mom, so I've never looked at any of this like it's some kind of challenge. Some people have this perception that when you become a parent, the other life you were living just stops. I never thought of it that way. I've always pictured life as a mother with the kids along for the whole adventure, so I'm stoked it's working out. Addy's at the age where she's super active, and then having an infant who's nursing—it's a lot. But I sit down and take a deep breath every once in a while and remember this is very much the life I dreamed of.
Do you have any kind of parenting philosophy or anything you hope other parents can take from your example?
Don't underestimate your kids. Out of the womb, they can pretty much hold their heads up and start interacting with the world, and I don't think cradling them and swaddling them for six months or whatever does them any favors. The other thing I'd say is don't try to stereotype your kids. Kids grow up to be stereotypical because that's the way they were raised, not because it's something in them.
Addy loves dirt bikes and skateboards. They love all that stuff, because that's what she's growing up around. They also love baby dolls and toy cars and pink clothes. I grew up with parents who supported everything I did, whether it was skateboarding or soccer or surfing, gymnastics or playing baseball on the boys' team, and all of those experiences were important to shaping the person I am now.
You just had a baby a few months ago, but word has it you're going to be skating in the show when the Nitro Circus U.S. Tour begins next month.
That's the plan! Getting back on a skateboard has been harder this time, partly because Addy wants me to hold them and skate with her, which is great but doesn't help me skate. But performing with the Nitro Circus is a big part of who I am, just like it is for Travis, and it's also important to me for my girls and all the girls out there to see me skating. That's something I learned from Tony Hawk and Mat Hoffman when I was part of their Boom Boom Huck Jam tour: It's important to have girls out there as role models and as heroes. There is a place for girls—and even moms—in action sports.

Most Civilization games have ended with humankind moving to the stars. But that's just the start of Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth, the next installment in the 23-year-old strategy game franchise. Take-Two Interactive Software's 2K Games recently announced that Firaxis Games is working on the new title.
We caught up with the lead game designers for the project, Will Miller and David McDonough, to talk about how Beyond Earth will differ from predecessor Civilization V as well as the last big space-based Civ game, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.
The big difference is that this Civ experience will have more science as its foundation. Earth will become uninhabitable because of global warming. Humanity will have to move to other planets in the galaxy for survival.
You can design your mission to the stars by picking your leader and your resources, but after that, it's up to you to customize a lasting civilization in the face of enemy threats. You'll fend off aliens, other groups from Earth, and your new planet itself.
The title is coming out on Windows this fall. Here's an edited transcript of our interview with Miller and McDonough.

GamesBeat: Can you guys tell me how you got started on the title?
Will Miller: David and I are huge fans of space, just space in general. The history of manned space flight, science fiction, anything space. We're also big fans of Alpha Centauri, of course. Since we've been here, we've always romanticized about doing a Civ in space. It was the right time, and we had the right team. We just started working on it.
GamesBeat: Why would space be a better choice than another earthbound Civ?
Miller: It's a fascinating area to explore with the Civ franchise. Our fans have wanted it for a very long time. Like I say, we've always wanted to revisit this area. We just got the opportunity to do it.
GamesBeat: I remember playing Alpha Centauri pretty obsessively back in the day. I don't recall there being as much science behind that game as there seems to be in your game here.
David McDonough: That might be fair to say. I think Alpha Centauri was actually a pretty fun blend of science and science fiction. It was maybe a little heavier on the fiction side. But we've had a good time making that blend, too. We're different people, and we have a different level of fandom for the various branches of science and sci-fi.
One of my favorite things about this game is that it starts off very rooted in science and builds these threads of plausibility all the way through to its wildest, most ridiculous fiction. We sort of trick you along the way — “Oh, this is totally real, we can totally do this” — and, by the end of the game, you've gone totally sci-fi. But an emphasis on real science is part of our enthusiasm for the game. It's an opportunity to have some fun.
Miller: It's also functionally. The reason why we chose to take that approach is because we really care about the suspension of disbelief. We want to maintain that in the player throughout the whole experience. You do end up in a very sci-fi place at the end of the game. You're changing the physiology of the human species. You're making these fantastical vehicles and units. The face of the planet is changing based on what you've done to it. But to get there, we want you to go through these incremental steps that all make sense. When you finish a game of Beyond Earth, you can say, “Yeah, I understand how that, in some future, might happen.”

GamesBeat: It seems like you have a very plausible beginning for reaching to the stars, with all the new research on global warming. It provides a pretty good backstory for you.
Miller: We talk about the Great Mistake as this kind of catalyst that tips the balance a little bit, in a lot of different areas. There wasn't really an apocalypse, a world-ending event. It was an event, but it just pushed many of these things that we're dealing with today over the edge. Like you say, global warming, a very tenuous geopolitical landscape, things of that nature. Even drought can cause wars, over a period of 10 or 15 years. That's what we imply, that lots of different intervening factors ended up sending humankind into this dark age.
The optimistic part of it is that we all came out of it OK. It's at that point where we decide to go to the stars.
GamesBeat: Is this part of the game told in 30 seconds or do you see a larger cinematic beginning?
Miller: Some of it's told up front. We have a bit of exposition. But the story about Earth's past and what happened and all of that, the player is going to do a much better job making that story than we will. What we like to do is tell that story through hints and through suggestion and mystery. We let the player fill in the gaps.
GamesBeat: It's also maybe familiar because it's a natural ending to a lot of Civ games. You overbuild and you have flooded cities at some point.
Miller: Right. Roads everywhere and half the world's irradiated and all that.
GamesBeat: There's also an interesting design approach here in allowing players to do a lot on Earth before they take off. They design their spaceship and figure out who they're going to take, who their leader is going to be. There's a lot of strategy in that part of the game, right?
McDonough: There's a lot of strategy in it, but we don't want to misrepresent ourselves. The choices you make at the very beginning of the game are presented abstractly. You decide who you're going to start out as and what you're going to take with you, but the whole game takes place on the new planet. There's no gameplay on Earth, so to speak. You're just setting the starting conditions for your colony expedition, and then there's a bit of backstory with the intro to the game. When turn zero starts, it starts with you landing on the new world. From start to finish, it's about your next chapter, the chapter on the new planet.
GamesBeat: What kind of variety will you see as a result of some of these decisions you make in the beginning?
McDonough: Plenty. They have a huge, sweeping impact on your play style and your advantages. It affects all kinds of circumstances. Everything from diplomacy to city management will be affected by the particular blend of starting loadout choices you make. One of the most interesting things about the game so far, that we're already having a good time with, is how just one change can make for a very different experience. If you change those circumstances even a little bit, the story you'll tell on the new world and the way that you'll face the problems you encounter … your strengths come from different places, so the story is different.
Miller: We talk a lot about eliminating the critical path in Civ. We never want there to be a definitive build order or technology-research order. We want there to be thought in every decision you make, based on the specifics of this particular playthrough. Where you landed, how the aliens are reacting to you, who your neighbors are, what kind of quests you get, things like that. The loadout options are one more way that we mix the game up.
There are still personalities to the civilizations. You still have the warlike ones and the economically focused ones or whatever. But because of these loadout options, you can never really know the leaders you're up against until you've interacted with them through the game, through diplomacy. You have to build your strategies around discovering who they are and what they want. Your games are infinitely replayable because of these choices you make in the beginning.
LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Ricardo Montalban, star of the hit TV series "Fantasy Island," died Wednesday in Los Angeles, a family spokesperson said.
Ricardo Montalban attends the opening of a theater named for them in 2004 in Hollywood, California.
Montalban, 88, was in deteriorating health over the past several days but "died peacefully" at 6:30 a.m. at their home, son-in-law Gilbert Smith said.
They understood "it was their time," Smith said. The cause of death was not given.
Montalban rose to prominence as one of the most visible Hispanic actors in post-war Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. But their star grew as they took on television roles as the mysterious host Mr. Roarke on the hit drama "Fantasy Island" and as Captain Kirk's archnemesis Khan Noonien Singh in "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."
Born in Mexico City, Mexico, on November 25, 1920, Montalban knew at an early age that they wanted to be an actor. They moved to Hollywood as a teenager, and their first big break came when they were cast in a small part in a 1941 play, Tallulah Bankhead's "Her Cardboard Lover."
After starring in 13 Spanish-language films in Mexico, Montalban made their American feature film debut in 1947 in "Fiesta."
Montalban became a member of the MGM stable and was often cast in the role of the steamy Latin lover opposite such female stars as Lana Turner and Esther Williams.
While working on "Across the Wide Missouri" with MGM's biggest star, Clark Gable, Montalban suffered an injury to their spinal cord that, despite surgery, would plague them for decades to come, according to Turner Classic Movies.
It was during this early stage in their career that Montalban dedicated themselves to changing Hollywood's stereotypes of Latinos.
"When I first came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer under contract in 1945, that's when the image was at its worst," Montalban said. "They didn't realize that by trying to be colorful, they were very insulting."
Montalban played a wide range of film roles over the years, often relishing the chance to play in comedies.
As they approached midlife in the 1960s, Montalban made numerous guest appearances on television shows including "The Untouchables" and "The Lieutenant," eventually landing a recurring role as Damon West on the popular medical drama "Dr. Kildare."
During this period, Montalban secured their place in science-fiction history playing the evil but charismatic Khan in the first season of "Star Trek."
Montalban's dignified demeanor and rich accent added flair to the small screen on a number of television shows. It also established them as a popular pitchman for Maxwell House Coffee and Chrysler.
It was the role of the wise and benevolent Mr. Roarke on the 1970's hit TV series "Fantasy Island" that perhaps earned Montalban their greatest number of fans, something they called "very rewarding." iReport.com: Share your memories of Montalban
But they said they tired of hearing fans shouting "Zee plane, zee plane" when they saw him. The line was featured in the show's opening credits by another character, Tattoo.
"They think they are the only ones that thought of saying that," they told CNN during the 1990s. "People mean well, but the joke gets a little tired at times."
Montalban never tired of fighting for the rights of Latinos in Hollywood. For almost 20 years, they served as president of Nosotros, an organization they founded for the advancement of Hispanics in the entertainment industry.
"The ideals of Nosotros continue. As our community of Latinos in show business increases, so will our participation in all of the many aspects of our industry," they said in 1987.
Apple Inc. is in the process of hiring automotive technology experts, set to work out of the company's secret facility in Cupertino, Calif. to potentially develop a car, according to a report from The Financial Times.
[np_storybar title=”12 must-see cars at the Canadian International Auto Show” link=”http://driving.ca/mercedes-benz/amg-gt-s/auto-shows/cdn-intl-auto-show/12-must-see-cars-at-the-2015-canadian-international-autoshow”%5D If you only have time to see 12 cars at this week's auto show in Toronto, these cars are your best bet — and check out full coverage of the Canadian International Auto Show here

Industry experts have been speculating Apple has been exploring the medical and automotive industry as a growth area for the company for some time now, as revenue from iPad products continues to dip. Mercedes-Benz's head of research and development is reportedly the most recent addition to Apple's new automotive-focused team.
Adrian Percia, Apple's head of mergers and acquisitions, reportedly met with Tesla Motors Inc. last year, which sparked speculation that the company may have considered acquiring the Model S electric car manufacturer, founded by billionaire Elon Musk. The Wall Street Journal is reporting Apple's rumoured car project is called “Project Titan,” and that its current version “resembles a minivan.”
Other industry speculation indicates Apple could be moving into the medical field, launching devices that have the ability to predict heart attacks. Apple's upcoming Apple Watch has various medical capabilities, ranging from monitoring user's heart rates to tracking movement, but isn't set to launch until later this year.
In the past two years Apple's main rival, Google Inc., purchased thermostat manufacturer Nest Labs for US$3.2-billion, as well as robot maker Boston Dynamics and DeepMind Technologies Ltd. Self-driving cars have also long been on Google's radar, currently in development at the company's top-secret “Google X” facility.
In March last year, Apple revealed its new infotainment software dubbed CarPlay, allowing drivers to use much of the iPhone's functionality hands-free while driving a vehicle.
Apple, which like Google is trying to incorporate its software into cars, has recently tried to recruit from the automotive industry, two sources with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters.
In-car infotainment systems are often cited as potential areas of expansion for major technology companies. Google announced its Android Auto infotainment platform – which is set to compete against Apple's CarPlay – during this year's Consumer Electronics Show. BlackBerry's QNX platform controls everything from a vehicle's GPS to safety related features, and is seen as one of the struggling company's rare successes, currently commands more than half of the rapidly growing market for in-vehicle infotainment.
Apple has been trying to poach experts in fields such as robotics, according to Reuters' sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
“Three months ago I would have said it was CarPlay,” an individual who worked closely with Apple for many years told Financial Times.
“Today I think it's a car.”

The IMF has just released its latest Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) for Greece. It makes grim reading. Greece is never going to grow its way out of debt. And the 3.5% primary surplus to which the Syriza government seems hell-bent upon committing is frankly unbelievable: the IMF thinks sustaining even 1.5% would be a stretch. Banks will need another 10bn Euros (on top of the 43bn Euros the Greek government has already borrowed to bail them out). Asset sales are a lost cause, mainly because the banks – which were a large proportion of the assets up for sale – won't be worth anything for the foreseeable future.
Like it or not, debt relief will be necessary. If there is no debt relief, by 2060 debt service will soar to an impossible 60% of government spending. Of course, Greece would default long before that – but that would make the situation in Greece even worse.
None of this is news. The IMF has been saying for nearly a year now that Greece will need debt relief. This latest DSA is designed to shock the Europeans into giving it serious consideration. It is not surprising, therefore, that the debt sustainability projections are significantly worse than in previous DSAs. No doubt the European creditors will disagree with them, the Syriza government will side with the Europeans because the only alternative is Grexit, and the European Commission will claim there is “progress” when all that is really happening is that a very battered can is being kicked once again.
But buried in the IMF's report are some very unpleasant numbers indeed - the IMF's projections for population and employment out to 2060. And I think the world should know about them.
Here is what the IMF has to say about the outlook for Greek unemployment (my emphasis):
Demographic projections suggest that working age population will decline by about 10 percentage points by 2060. At the same time, Greece will continue to struggle with high unemployment rates for decades to come. Its current unemployment rate is around 25 percent, the highest in the OECD, and after seven years of recession, its structural component is estimated at around 20 percent. Consequently, it will take significant time for unemployment to come down. Staff expects it to reach 18 percent by 2022, 12 percent by 2040, and 6 percent only by 2060.
So even if the Greek economy returns to growth and its creditors agree to debt relief, it will take 44 years to reduce Greek unemployment to something approaching normal. For Greece's young people currently out of work, that is all of their working life. A whole generation will have been consigned to the scrapheap.
And if the Greek economy does not return to sustainable growth, then unemployment will remain in double digits for – well, who knows how long.
The truth is that seven years of recession has wrecked the Greek economy. It is no longer capable of generating enough jobs to employ its population. The IMF estimates that even in good times, 20 percent of adults would remain unemployed. To generate the jobs that are needed there will have to be large numbers of new businesses, perhaps even whole new industries. Developing such extensive new productive capacity takes time and requires substantial investment – and Greece is not the most attractive of investment prospects. Absent something akin to a Marshall Plan, it will take many, many years to repair the damage deliberately inflicted on Greece by European authorities and the IMF in order to bail out the European banking system.
Of course, Greece's young people will not put up with the prospect of spending their entire lives out of work. Those who can, will leave. And that will make Greece's recovery even less likely.
Greece has one of the fastest rates of population ageing in the world. The IMF projects that to make Greece's public finances sustainable, the labor force participation rate will have to rise from its current 52 percent to around 73 percent. This means that the old will have to work for many more years, women will have to do far more paid work, and the sick & disabled will have to work too. Basically, Greece already cannot afford its safety nets. Significant emigration of younger people – or sustained levels of high unemployment - would make matters much worse: it would leave Greece with increasing numbers of pensioners to support but far fewer workers to support them.
So although the young face an uncertain future, it is older people, the sick & disabled, and those who care for them, who will ultimately pay the price of Greece's failure. For them, the future looks very bleak.

Customer satisfaction with federally provided services climbed to its highest peak in four years, a survey suggests.
Satisfaction with the federal government had reached an all-time low in 2015, after dipping each year from its all-time high in 2012, according to the American Citizen Satisfaction Index, an economic indicator registered to the University of Michigan.
The improved quality of some federal websites—described as "ease and usefulness"—could explain the sudden surge in satisfaction, the report said. Other driving factors could have been improved "timeliness and efficiency of processes," courtesy and professionalism of federal employees, and the clarity of information that federal agencies disperse.

On a scale of zero to 100, citizens rated their overall satisfaction with federal services in 2016 at 68, up from 63 in 2015. Among individual agencies, the Interior and State departments led the group with satisfaction scores of 78. Interior users were generally looking up national parks online, and State customers generally referred to their experiences renewing or receiving passports.
The Treasury Department bottomed out the ranking with a score of 59—"not surprising given that its primary citizen-facing agency is the Internal Revenue Service," the report said. The Veterans Affairs Department was second lowest at 66.
ACSI researchers suggested customers' interaction with the Health and Human Services Department may also have driven up satisfaction scores, in addition to better federal websites. Customers of HHS made up a larger percentage of the 2,380 people polled this year versus previous years, and satisfaction with that department jumped 8 percent to 67, potentially because of improvements in HealthCare.gov.
"As the impending fight to scrap and/or replace the [Affordable Care Act] legislation advances in 2017, it will be important to track potential effects on citizen satisfaction," the report said.
A nationwide prison strike planned Friday has Florida's jails and state prisons on high alert through the weekend, bracing for possible upheavals by inmates protesting what they say is inhumane and violent treatment.
Already, a revolt at Holmes Correctional in Florida's Panhandle on Wednesday night, involving more than 400 inmates, caused damage to nearly every dorm during an uprising that lasted into the early morning. No one was seriously injured, but the department is concerned that the disturbance might be a harbinger of what's to come.
Florida's prison system, the third-largest in the country, has been dangerously understaffed for nearly a year, and several sieges have occurred in recent weeks. To further exacerbate tensions, many inmates have been in forced confinement in their dorms, allowed out only to eat because there isn't even enough staff to guard them during outside recreation.
Over the past two years, the Miami Herald has published a series of stories documenting the brutal or unexplained deaths of inmates in Florida prisons, a record number of use-of-force incidents and corruption by guards and top officers.

In recent weeks, the department has had disturbances at Jackson Correctional, Gulf Correctional, Franklin Correctional and Okaloosa CI. All of them, like Holmes, are located in Region 1, in the Panhandle. And a corrections officer was stabbed during a melee at Columbia CI in April.
“It's very hot in those dorms and when you can't get any rec, the inmates start causing problems,'' said a veteran corrections officer at Holmes, who would not allow their name to be used for fear of reprisals.
The loosely organized national strike, a grassroots effort, comes on the 45th anniversary of the prison riots at Attica, the 1971 prison siege near Buffalo, New York, considered the largest prison rebellion in U.S. history. Over 40 people died when inmates took control of the facility for four days, protesting racism, officer beatings, rancid food, no rehabilitation programs and forced labor.
Phillip A. Ruiz, an organizer for the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee, one of the groups spearheading the Friday demonstrations, said conditions in America's prisons aren't that different from those at Attica 45 years ago.
“They are participating in work stoppages, hunger strikes and sit-ins in protest of long-term isolation, inadequate healthcare, overcrowding, violent attacks and slave labor,'' said Ruiz, whose committee is part of the Industrial Workers of the World, an international labor union whose membership peaked a century ago.
Ruiz said organizers are emphasizing that the protests will be nonviolent. Florida corrections officers have nevertheless been briefed and are prepared to work all weekend in case there are uprisings.
Of the disturbances in Florida, the riot at Holmes involved the most inmates so far — more than 400 of the 1,100 men incarcerated there — and was spread across the compound.
Officers interviewed by the Herald said that Wednesday's rebellion began in B Dorm about 6 p.m. One officer, stationed in a control center (called “the bubble”), was in charge of nearly 150 inmates. The prisoners put blankets and sheets over the windows of the bubble then proceeded to smash cameras, ransack the dorm and then began tearing away the ceiling and crawling in the attic, possibly trying to escape.
Officers from five other prisons were called in, as well as special RRTs (Rapid Response Teams) trained to handle riots. Though some officers were armed, no shots were fired, sources said.
“We would get one dorm under control and then it would start in another dorm. It was every dorm, as if it was planned,” the Holmes officer said.
It took until 4 a.m. to bring the compound under control, they said. Officers were able to restrain many inmates after setting off canisters of chemicals, making it hard for the prisoners to breathe, the officer said.
The compound in Bonifay, a town of just more than 4,000 that is bisected by Interstate 10, was still on lockdown Thursday, according to a statement released by FDC shortly after noon. One inmate was injured but no corrections officers were hurt, the statement said.
The department did not say when the uprising happened, what precipitated it, how long it took to bring it under control or how much damage occurred.
Photographs leaked to the Herald show damage to ceilings, floors, beds, walls, cameras and doors. The inmates were transported to other prisons, FDC said.
“The department is currently accessing the facility for any damages that have resulted and have transported all the involved inmates to other locations. Additional information will be made available following a comprehensive after-action review and investigation,” FDC's statement concluded.
The riot is the latest in a series of disturbances that have plagued the agency since January. Many institutions are at minimum staffing levels because of a shortage of corrections officers statewide.
The staff at Holmes, like many Florida prisons, has an abundance of young, inexperienced officers who have had little training.
“These officers are 19, 20, 21, some of them still live at home. They put them in charge of dorms for 12 hours a day with professional convicts, all by themselves,” said the officer. “I'm not a worrier but when you walk into those dorms you don't know what you have or what they are going to do.”
Kim Schultz, president of the union representing the department's officers, called the situation “extremely dangerous.” Florida's state corrections officers are some of the lowest paid in the country, and they haven't had pay raises in more than eight years, they said.
“This has resulted in high turnover and inexperienced officers who are not equipped to deal with prison riots,” they said.
LONDON — Are you au fait with Ordnance Survey? Know how to read a six figure grid reference? If you were left on a moor with just a compass and a map would you find your way home safely or wander aimlessly, eventually getting eaten by wolves?
The Royal Institute of Navigation are concerned about the nation's cartographical know-how and have suggested schools start teaching basic navigation to address the issue.
They believe we're all too reliant on technology, expecting smartphones and satellite navigation systems to do the hard work for us and becoming "sedated by software" in the process.
“It is concerning that children are no longer routinely learning at home or school how to do anything more than press ‘search' buttons on a device to get anywhere," Roger McKinlay, president of the Royal Institute of Navigation said.
“Many cannot read a landscape, an Ordnance Survey map, or find their way to a destination with just a compass, let alone wonder at the amazing role astronomy plays in establishing a precise location."
“Instead, generations are now growing up utterly dependent on signals and software to find their way around."

The institute say they want schools to teach basic navigation "as a way to develop character, independence and an appreciation of maths and science."
They point out that phones can lose their signal and sat navs can lead you up the garden path, and the human brain is better at taking in all data such as weather and terrain. However, they insist that something more fundamental is at stake as we forget skills that have guided people for centuries.
"There is a wider issue than navigation here," they say. "Our view is that reliance on computers presents no conceptual challenges."
"The human brain is left largely inert and untaxed while calculations are made electronically, by a software ‘brain' without the elasticity to make connections and judgements.”
The institute's membership includes Polar explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes, a man who probably doesn't use Citymapper too often. Their patron, the Duke of Edinburgh, meanwhile, runs a charity that teaches young people a variety of life skills including navigation.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders has cut its forecast for lending to landlords for this year and next SUZANNE PLUNKETT/REUTERS
Buy-to-let lending is slowing more quickly than expected after a regulatory and tax crackdown on the sector that has given first-time buyers a new lease of life.
The Council of Mortgage Lenders has cut its forecast for landlord loans to £35 billion this year, from £38 billion, after seeing a collapse in activity. Over the past year, buy-to-let purchases have averaged about 6,000 a month, nearly half last year's level.
With buy-to-let on the wane, “first-time buyers have recovered slowly”, the council said in its update for May.
“Buy-to-let had a weak start to 2017, and the sector's contribution to overall net mortgage lending has fallen considerably over the last year,” Paul Smee, director-general of the council, said.
Landlords have been hit by an array…

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: CONFIRMED
IGN has just confirmed that ABC is 100% picking up Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Yesterday, a bit of viral video turned up online — some surveillance-type footage, where an evil organization named Rising Tide is looking through a viewfinder trying to find... the Hulk. It's all very high tech, Hollywood-style, and the Hulk is actually outlined with some sort of wacky identification software. And here it is:
Anyone else finds it hilarious that the Hulk is in the first bit of teaser footage after Whedon said they wouldn't?

UPDATE: Sorry it seems that the internet reports have jumped the gun. We just spoke to an ABC spokesperson on the phone, who would only confirm that the series is "likely" to be picked up. And that they aren't sure when the news will be made official.
UPDATE #2: According to a tweet from the apparently official Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. account and E! Online, this time it really is official: the show has been picked up for the fall season. And they released the shiny cast photo which you can see up top. And a preview for the series will be shown during Sunday's Once Upon a Time finale. And here's a new logo!

Campus police killed Scout Schultz, 21, who they said was advancing on officers with a knife, but mother questions why police didn't use nonlethal force
A Georgia Tech police officer overreacted by firing a gunshot that killed an LGBTQ student activist who investigators say was armed with a knife and ignored commands to drop it, a lawyer for the family said on Monday.
Campus police killed Scout Schultz, 21, who they said was advancing on officers with a knife. Schultz refused to put down the knife and kept moving towards officers late on Saturday outside a dormitory, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in a statement.
“Officers provided multiple verbal commands and attempted to speak with Shultz who was not cooperative and would not comply with the officers' commands,” the agency said in a statement. “Shultz continued to advance on the officers with the knife.”
Attorney Chris Stewart told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution they thought Schultz was having a mental breakdown and didn't know what to do. Stewart and the student's family planned a news conference on Monday morning.
WSB-TV reported that the item involved, still on the ground when its news crew arrived, appeared to be a “metal, flip-open, multi-tool knife”.
Authorities did not immediately identify the officer who shot Schultz or release the 911 call that led to the confrontation. Preliminary information indicates that the initial call reported a person with a knife and a gun about 11.17pm, the GBI said in a statement.
Georgia Tech on Monday refused to release the 911 call or any personnel or disciplinary reports involving the officers, saying that such information was exempt from Georgia's open records law.
Schultz was president of Pride Alliance at Georgia Tech. The fourth-year computer engineering student used the name Scout and preferred the pronouns “they” and “them” rather than “him” or “her”.
“I'm bisexual, nonbinary and intersex,” Schultz wrote in a Pride Alliance profile.
Lynne Schultz told the Journal-Constitution that their oldest child was a brilliant student despite numerous medical issues including depression, and had twice attempted suicide.
Most of Schultz's stress was related to school, Lynne Schultz said. “Scout was always a perfectionist. They always worried they were going to fail a test but got all As and only two Bs at Tech.”
Schultz's father, William, said their child had a history of depression but they aren't aware of any particular difficulties in recent weeks. William Schultz said Scout was a great student with a 3.9 GPA and was on track to graduate early in December.
Scout had spent the summer at home, they said, to decompress after working straight through the two previous summers. After attempting suicide two years ago, Scout Schultz went through counseling and there was no indication anything was wrong when their father dropped them at school last month.

Many questions remained on Monday. GBI spokesperson Nelly Miles said on Sunday they did not know whether the officer who fired at Schultz was trained in dealing with suspects who have mental disorders.
The GBI, through its Crisis Intervention Team, has trained about 10,000 local, state and federal law enforcement officers since it began in 2004, the Journal-Constitution reported. Atlanta, Roswell, Henry County and now DeKalb are among the agencies that require all of its officers to take the class. Some agencies do not require it.
“Why didn't they use some nonlethal force, like pepper spray or Tasers?” Lynne Schultz said.
Police at the Georgia Institute of Technology do not carry Tasers or stun guns but are equipped with pepper spray, a Georgia Tech spokesperson told the newspaper.
In May 2015, the University System of Georgia implemented a system-wide campus safety initiative. Among its recommendations: establish a program to review training needs for campus law enforcement at the state's public colleges and universities. It set a 2016 timeline for establishing the program to identify gaps and develop necessary training programs.
The outcome of those recommendations wasn't immediately known on Monday. A representative of the university system was looking into the matter.

The Advocate
CLINTON, La. — It has been called “the squirt gun from hell,” even by lawmen who haven't experienced its memorable burn. Its chemical agent — a concentrated blast of pepper spray fired at a dizzying 405 mph — can disable and disorient an aggressor for 45 minutes or longer.
“This is potent enough to drop a bear,” said Darron Teeters, an instructor and regional director with JPX America, the Huntsville, Texas-based company pitching its patented pepper guns to law enforcement agencies across Louisiana. “One of these Louisiana people called it the ‘hot loogie.' ”
Touted as a cheaper alternative to the stun gun, the JPX Pepper Gun is appearing on more and more police utility belts as another method of “less-lethal force” authorities can use to subdue unruly suspects. About 70 agencies in the state — mostly smaller, rural agencies — are using the devices, Teeters said, adding they expect that number to grow significantly in coming months.

I recently finished reading Tony Dungy's book, The Mentor Leader: Secrets to Building People and Teams That Win Consistently. It gave me new insight on what it means to be a Mentor Leader and how to effectively go about influencing lives for the greater good.
Tony defines Mentor leaders as individuals that seek to have a direct, intentional, and positive impact on those they lead. They went on to say that “At its core, mentoring is about building character into the lives of others, modeling and teaching attitudes and behaviors, and creating a constructive legacy to be passed along to future generations of leaders.”
I've had multiple opportunities to be both a mentor and a mentee. As such, I can appreciate the topics covered from both ends of the spectrum and agree with the support that mentees need and what mentors need to be conscience of. The biggest takeaway from their book was definitely the 7 E's of Mentor Leadership, which are Engage, Educate, Equip, Encourage, Empower, Energize and Elevate.
Engage – It's impossible to mentor from a distance. Building relationships with the people around you is imperative for having a positive effect on their lives. As a Mentor Leader, we have to walk alongside those we lead, and love every step of it.
Educate – Mentor leadership is all about helping others become the best they can be, it is the built on a foundation of teaching, helping and guiding. I was reminded of how important and effective taking a hands-on, one-on-one approach is in making that difference in a person's life.
Equip – In essence, as mentor leaders, we need to ensure that an individual is physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually prepared to accomplish a given task. Often times people are thrown into situations and expected to “swim”. This one goes hand in hand with Educate. We not only have to provide the tools that they need to be successful, but also show them how to use it.
Encourage – Encouragement is the fuel that powers our efforts to engage, educate, and equip. People need affirmation and encouragement. Saying “Good Job” or acknowledging someone's efforts, simply put, make them feel good.
Empower – True empowerment is preparation followed by appropriate freedom. At some point you have to let your mentee loose and watch them do their job.
Energize – Great leaders energize, motivate and inspire those they lead.
Elevate – The ultimate goal of every mentor leader is to build and grow other leaders for long-term, sustainable success. This was one of the biggest E's I took to heart. In many of the relationships that I have provided some form of mentorship, I've challenged individuals to strive for excellence in the same way I did. The problem with that was that I didn't challenge them to surpass me. To elevate your peers means to help them reach their God-given potential, even if it means preparing them to replace you.
This coolest thing about being a mentor leader, is witnessing the success of the people you've elevated. It's not about getting credit; it's about helping everyone be the best they can be. A friend of mine once told me “It's your journey, I'm just along for the ride.” In the same sense, we all need to buckle up and enjoy the ride.
Like many elements in life, there is always a deliberate effort or approach that yields great results and creates that difference. Mentoring is no exception, it has to be deliberate. We need to Engage with those that we are blessed to lead. Once we've engaged them, we're able to Educate and Equip them. Throughout that process, it is essential that we Encourage, Empower, and Energize in order to finally Elevate the people around us.

Summary
Fueled by the Cold War and transnational corporate interests, the U.S. has covertly tinkered with the governments of Latin American countries since World War 2, producing an extremely violent and unstable political climate. This history gives context to the growing anti-Americanism in Latin America, most visibly illustrated in the open defiance of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales to US policy. It also gives context to the recent trend in Latin America to elect left-wing governments.
Analysis
A Timeline of US Intervention in Latin America
Guatemala 1954: A CIA-organized coup overthrew the democratically elected and progressive government of Jacobo Arbenz. The U.S. justified its involvement by claiming that Soviets had an uncomfortable amount of influence over Guatemala, even though the two countries didn't even maintain diplomatic relations. The real reason for U.S. involvement came from pressure from the United Fruit Company, whose land was expropriated by Arbenz's progressive land reforms. The CIA action took a form that became the mold for CIA intervention in Latin America: The bribery of military officers and a propaganda campaign against the leftist government that included the resurrection of oppositional radio stations, the mass distribution of anti-government leaflets, and the anonymous submission of articles to newspapers painting the Arbenz government as communist. The U.S. also used international political clout to pressure the UN to ignore Arbenz's request for an investigation of the incident. The coup was followed by a 40-year period of instability and brutality in Guatemala.
British Guiana (currently Guyana) 1953-64: CIA and British Intelligence funded anti-communist unions in order to strengthen opposition to democratically elected Dr. Cheddi Jagan. When this failed, the Churchill government simply removed them from office due to their socialist leanings. In 1957, Jagan was re-elected, and in response the U.S. Information Service launched an anti-communist (anti-Jagan) media campaign. Despite this, Jagan was re-elected again in 1961, which moved the British government to organize strikes in the unions that they had previously funded. The British government used these strikes as a sign of incompetence on the part of Jagan and changed the constitution to remove them from power.
Cuba 1959-present: After the Cuban revolution in 1959, the U.S. did everything in its power to prevent its government from succeeding. The U.S. performed air raids and even mobilized Cuban exiles to attack Cuba in the infamous CIA-orchestrated Bay of Pigs. The U.S. also enacted trade and credit embargos, sabotaged goods destined for Cuba, made multiple assassination attempts on Castro, their brother Raul, and Che Guevara.
Ecuador 1960-63: The CIA infiltrated the Ecuadorian government, set up news agencies and radio stations, bombed right-wing agencies and churches and blamed the left, all to force democratically elected Velasco Ibarra from office. When their replacement, Carlos Arosemara, refused to break relations with Cuba, the CIA-funded military took over the country, outlawed communism, and cancelled the 1964 elections.
Brazil 1961-64: After democratically elected Janio da Silva Quadros of the Brazilian Labor Party (PTB) resigned, citing military and U.S. pressure as the reasons, their successor, Joao Goulart, was overthrown by a U.S.-supported military coup in 1964. Critics argue that this is because Goulart promoted social and economic reforms, limited the profits of multinationals, nationalized a subsidiary of U.S.-owned International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), and refused to break relations with Cuba and other socialist countries. They were replaced by two decades of a brutal military regime. There would not be another Labor Party president until the election of Lula da Silva in 2002.
Peru mid-1960's: The CIA set up military training camps and provided arms to the Peruvian government to combat guerilla forces.
Dominican Republic 1963-65: In 1963, Juan Bosch took office as the first democratically elected president of the Dominican Republic since 1924. They were a true liberal and called for land reform, low-rent housing, modest nationalization of business, and restrictions on foreign investment. Seven months after being elected, the U.S. allowed a right wing military coup to take over the government. Nineteen months later, a popular revolution broke out which attempted to reinstate Bosch. The U.S. reacted by sending in troops to stop the Bosch revolutionaries. Meanwhile, the CIA and U.S. Information Agency (USIA) conducted an intensive propaganda campaign against Bosch. U.S. troops stayed in the Dominican Republic until September 1966, when, thanks in part to the anti-Bosch media campaign, Juan Bosch lost the election to Joaquin Balaguer.
Uruguay 1964-1970: The CIA and the Agency for International Development (AID) set up the Office of Public Safety (OPS) mission in Montevideo to train police in the art of torture in order to suppress rebel activity. The torture and killing was mainly directed at the Tupamaros, guerrillas who embarrassed public officials and exposed corporate corruption.
Now that Tabare Vasquez, Uruguay's new left-leaning president, is in office, many who were once Tupamaro guerillas are now holding positions in government. This roster includes Agriculture minister Jose Pepe Mujica and Federal deputy Luis Rosadilla, who previously spent nine years in prison for their guerrilla activity.
Chile 1964-1973: After the CIA unsucessfully prevented Salvador Allende from winning the Chilean presidency by spreading propaganda and funding the opposition, it concentrated its efforts on getting Allende overthrown. The campaign, which involved bribing officers and spreading misinformation, was eventually successful and brutal dictator General Augusto Pinochet overthrew Allende in 1973. Allende died during the overthrow and seventeen years of repressive military rule followed.
The recently elected Chilean president, Michelle Bachelet, was themselves imprisoned and tortured by Pinochet's regime, as was their father, who died while in captivity. In their acceptance speech, Bachelet promised that to lead with tolerance, saying “because I was the victim of hatred, I have dedicated my life to reverse that hatred and turn it into understanding, tolerance and — why not say it — into love.”
Bolivia 1964-75: In 1952, an armed popular revolt defeated the military, displaced the oligarchy, nationalized the mines, instituted land reform, set up a new government, and reduced the military to an impotent force. Yet under the training (School of Americas) and financial support of the CIA and Pentagon, the military was built up again and overthrew President Victor Paz in 1964 because of their refusal to support Washington's Cuba policies. (Note: this was nothing new for Bolivia, which has experienced the passing of governments more frequently than the passing of years.)
In January 2006, as Evo Morales was sworn in as Bolivia's first indigenous president, they predicted a future of indigenous rule, saying, “We are here to say enough of the 500 years of Indian resistance. From 500 years of resistance, we pass to another 500 years in power.” Later that year, Morales sent Bolivian troops to occupy 56 gas installations and demanded all foreign energy-firms sign new contracts giving Bolivia majority ownership and as much as 82% of revenues, which they did.
Argentina 1970's: While Argentina was receiving worldwide condemnation for their human rights abuses during the “Dirty War” against left-wing dissidents, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was recorded giving the go-ahead to then-Argentine foreign minister Augusto Guzzetti. “We would like you to succeed,” said Kissinger of the civil war against the Argentine leftists. From 1975 to 1983, about 30,000 civilians accused of subversion either died or disappeared.
Nicaragua 1978-1990: When the Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza dictatorship in 1979, the U.S. was frightened by what they thought could be another Cuba. President Jimmy Carter tried to sabotage the revolution through economic and diplomatic forms, and later Reagan used violence. For eight years, Nicaragua faced military attacks by the U.S. funded Contras (Reagan's “freedom fighters). In 1990, the U.S. interfered in national elections, and the Sandinistas were defeated. According to Oxfam, the international development organization, Nicaragua under the Sandinistas was “exceptional in the strength of that government's commitment…to improving the condition of the people and encouraging [an] active development process.” Now, Nicaragua is one of the poorest nations in the hemisphere, with widespread illiteracy and malnutrition.
Honduras 1980's: Honduras was basically a colony of the U.S. during the Contra war in Nicaragua. Thousands of U.S. troops were housed there and it was used as a supply center and refuge for the Contras. The U.S. funded the Contras by covertly and illegally selling arms to Iran (known as the Iran-Contra Affair).
Grenada 1979-1983: A 1979 coup took control of this small island country and attempted to install socialist reforms. The Reagan administration used destabilization tactics and eventually invaded in 1983, resulting in U.S. as well as Grenadian and Cuban casualties.
El Salvador 1980-92: After the U.S. helped fix an election to repress dissidents in El Salvador, the rebels turned to violence and a civil war ensued. Although the U.S. claimed to be only involved on an advisory basis 20 U.S. soldiers were killed in combat missions. The U.S. spent six billion dollars repressing this popular revolution.
Haiti 1987-94: After supporting the Duvalier family dictatorship for 30 years and opposing Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the U.S. claimed to support the elections that returned Aristide to power after they were ousted by a 1991 military coup. Meanwhile, they warned Aristide that they would only allow them to rule if they implemented free market policies. Aristide did not remain in power for long, however, and in a subsequent interview they attributed their removal from power to their refusal to privatize Haiti's state-owned enterprises.
The 2004 coup was orchestrated by the leaders of the FRAPH, or Haitian Front for Advancement and Progress, a CIA-backed organization that carried out state terror against opponents of the military regime that ruled the country from 1991 to 1994. Another leader in the armed coup against Aristide was Guy Philippe, a former member of the Haitian military who received training from US Special Forces in Ecuador in the 1990s. After these forces pushed Aristide into exile, the U.S. stepped in to restore stability in Haiti, now under new rule. Since Aristide's removal from power, their supporters have been targeted by the UN forces now tasked with “peace keeping,” killing many innocents from Haiti's poorest neighborhoods in the process.
Panama 1989: Just weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. invaded Panama, killing thousands and leaving many more wounded and homeless in order to capture Manuel Noriega, a previous ally of the U.S.
Mexico, Peru, and Colombia 1990's to present: Under the guise of the drug war, the U.S. has given military aid to these countries despite their poor human rights records. This aid is used to fight rebel forces.
Venezuela: Recent U.S. intervention in Venezuela manifests itself as millions of dollars in contributions to political opponents of leftist President Hugo Chavez. The short-lived 2002 coup d'etat that kidnapped the democratically elected president was orchestrated by groups who had received funding from the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy (NED). When the opposition took power, they dissolved all of Venezuela's democratic institutions, including the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the Constitution, the General Attorney, and the Public Defender's office. Meanwhile, their plan promised a return to free market economic policies. The coup only lasted two days before a popular resistance reinstated Chavez.

Wine is one of the oldest alcoholic beverages on the planet. Its history spans thousands of years and while heavy drinking of any alcoholic beverage rather brings lots of health-related troubles instead of benefits, current research suggests that a glass of red wine each day may be providing you with more than just a little relaxation.
Reduced risk of death from nearly all causes : European researchers suggest that moderate daily intake of red wine (22-32 g of alcohol) has a protective effect on all-cause mortality. According to studies from France, UK, Finland and Denmark, moderate consumption of wine is more beneficial than that of beer or spirits.
Smoking : Acute smoking significantly impairs vessels' natural ability to relax, or vasodilate. Red wine, with or without alcohol, decreases the harmful effect of smoking on the endothelium – layer of cells that provide a friction-reducing lining in lymph vessels, blood vessels, and the heart.
Heart disease : One of the well-known and most studied benefits of red wine is its heart protective effect. Moderate consumption of red wine on a regular basis may be a preventative against coronary heart disease. Scientists believe the red wine reduces the risk of coronary heart disease by reducing production of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and boosting high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
Blood clots : Red wine produces anticlotting, or antithrombotic, action. Light to moderate consumers of wine have lower levels of protein fibrinogen which promotes blood clot formation.
Atherosclerosis : Red wine may prevent the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis (hardening or “furring” of the arteries). Atherosclerosis starts when blood vessels begin to lose their ability to relax. Both the alcohol and polyphenols in the red wine appear to favorably maintain healthy blood vessels by promoting the formation of nitric oxide (NO), the key chemical relaxing factor that plays an important role in the regulation of vascular tone.
Hypertension : Excessive alcohol consumption is generally considered a risk factor for hypertension. However, there is some evidence of favorable effects of red wine on blood pressure. Two glasses of red wine (250 ml), taken together with the meal, lower post-meal blood pressure in hypertensive persons.
Kidney stones: Red wine intake reduces the risk of kidney stone formation.
Alzheimer's disease : Moderate wine drinking correlates with a lower risk for Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that resveratrol, a red wine polyphenol, produces neuroprotective effects.
So while my conclusion does not include a blanket statement telling everyone to drink wine everyday, it may be worth a try if your situation today leaves you at risk for any of the point above.

HUGE crowds demanding the resignation of Nick Clegg have gathered in London for demonstrations being called the ‘English Spring'.
People of all ages, religions and ethnicities have pledged to hold their vigil until the despised Clegg is replaced by peoples hero Vince Cable.
Giant banners with Cables image and the slogan A Golden Future For All Mankind have been draped over buildings, and demonstrators are burning effigies of Clegg while chanting Stand down or risk irrelevancy!
17-year-old Joanna Kramer said: All my life I have known only one Liberal Democrat leader.
My parents have told me of the old days of Paddy Ashdown and Charles Kennedy. I am too young to remember them, or maybe they were too dull to recall.
We want nothing less than total revolution and the only person who can bring that is our saviour Cable.
Hundreds of protestors have reportedly been arrested by Cleggs secret police and riots have raged throughout the capital as neighbouring countries look on, fearful of the domino effect if Clegg is toppled.
However, Clegg did not get to the top without ruthless cunning and has come back strongly by eating a bacon sandwich on LBC.
Kramer said: The revolution is over. All over. A generations dreams are dead.

Finally The Original Fantasy
by David 'Hades' Becker [ Wednesday, 24th of June 2009 - 10:24 PM ]
As if there hasn't been enough awesome Final Fantasy going about the interwebs since E3, Square-Enix drops some more good news for all of the FFFreaks (F3 from now on). Not as cool as a full on remake of FFVI for the PS3, or FFVII remake either, but today on the Japanese PSN "the game that launched a billion spin offs" was made available. I'm talking the original Final Fantasy. The PSOne upgrade version at that.
Now I know this doesn't mean it is coming to an english speaking PSN anytime soon, but if you look at the track record, it is pretty certain. Or at least we can hope or download it with a Japanese PSN account. Also download it for the price of games of comparable file size as well. 600 yen (6.30 USD) for a 60MB game of awesomeness. Not a bad deal at all if I do say so myself. They could have tried to charge the full cost of the game, but only went the way of a small PSN game. How kind.
Seems like only a small matter of time before we'll be able to have all of these great games and stories in one location. As long as it isn't just a cock tease to everyone but the Japanese kids there.
Victims of French nuclear tests say a report establishing a link between exposure to radiation and cases of cancer may prove decisive in their lengthy battle for compensation.
ADVERTISING Read more
Thanks to a landmark medical expert's report, a new link has been established between France's nuclear testing in the Pacific and North Africa and cases of cancer among civilians and former military personnel.
The findings, revealed by daily Le Parisien on Tuesday, could help speed up the lengthy legal process to compensate potential victims of these tests.
The French army conducted 210 nuclear tests in Algeria, a former French colony, and French Polynesia between 1960 and 1996.
An estimated 150,000 civilians and military personnel are thought to have been present during the tests, but the French state has long been reluctant to acknowledge the effects the tests may have had on their health.
A ‘likely' cancer link
Florent de Vathaire, an epidemiologist who carried out the research at the request of a French judge, told Le Parisien there was evidence of a “likely link” between the radioactivity generated by the nuclear tests and the development of various forms of cancer.
Vathaire cited the cases of a conscript who was merely told to shield their eyes with their forearm while observing nuclear explosions in 1968, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt. The soldier later died of leukaemia, a form of blood cancer the researcher said should be blamed on their stay in Mururoa, a Pacific atoll used by France as a nuclear testing site.
The epidemiologist said France's nuclear tests may have taken their toll on local populations as well. “Thanks to recent studies, we are now certain that small doses of radiation can seriously affect the thyroids of young children, causing cancers or other illnesses,” they added.
A lengthy legal battle
AVEN, a pressure group for victims of nuclear tests, said Tuesday's report would help improve existing legislation on compensation for victims.
The French parliament passed a law in 2010 establishing a compensation fund for victims of nuclear tests, but the victims' association says it is so restrictive that hardly anyone is eligible.
“To fit the conditions set by the law, you had to live in a precisely defined geographical area, you had to suffer from the ‘right' kind of illness and so on,” AVEN's Patrice Bouveret told FRANCE24. “Out of the 720 applications we sent, only four were even considered.”
Bouveret said they hoped the report would convince France's Defence Ministry to grant judges access to classified documents “showing the effect of nuclear tests as measured by the army at the time”.
Fred Bever reports on the European Union's decision to not ban American lobsters.
PORTLAND, Maine - In a victory for American and Canadian lobstermen, the European Union says it is rejecting a Swedish proposal to ban live American lobster from the EU's 28 member countries.
After finding several dozen American lobsters living off its shores, Sweden claimed that the crustacean threatened to interbreed with native European species, or bring new diseases to local fisheries.
But members of the European Commission's Invasive Alien Species Committee rejected that argument this week. In an email to Maine Public Radio, a Commission official says it has told Sweden that American Lobster will not be proposed for a blacklist of banned species, and it will instead pursue measures that would be less restrictive on trade.
"It really would have messed up our markets on an international level, and certainly would have had a major economic impact within the state of Maine," says Annie Tselikis, executive director of the Maine Lobster Dealers Association.
Tselikis says Maine's lobster trade with European countries is worth about $200 million annually, maybe a fifth of the state's overall market. At the key EU committee meeting this week, they add, the case for American lobster was pressed by Spain, Italy, and France.
"They really understood the science. Understood the trade relationship between the United States and Canada and all of the counties in Europe that import live lobster," Tselikis says. "So we are thrilled with the official word out of Europe today."
The news caps almost a year of effort by the industry and Maine's congressional delegation to get the EU to reject Sweden's claim - although interest remains in finding ways to ensure that Maine lobsters end up on Europeans' plates - and not in their waters.
The Swedish embassy in Washington referred inquiries to the country's minister of the environment, who could not immediately be reached for comment.

Angry Rhode Island voters overwhelmed a community dinner hosted by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse on Sunday evening, demanding an explanation as to why the Democratic lawmaker was not doing enough to resist U.S. President Donald Trump.
Specifically, the crowd took issue with the fact that Whitehouse was one of 14 Democrats who voted last week to confirm Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) to head the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), illustrating the backlash likely to befall other Democratic lawmakers who are similarly failing to challenge Trump and their nominees.
In a Facebook call to action, protest organizers blasted Whitehouse and fellow Rhode Island lawmaker Sen. Jack Reed for breaking "with the majority of their Democratic colleagues to vote in support of Trump's frightening pick for CIA director," who they described as "a Tea Party member of congress who has supported torture and has a disturbing history of anti-Muslim rhetoric and climate change denial."
"Whitehouse should be leading the resistance to Trump's dangerous agenda," the statement continued. "And we, the people, need to draw a line in the sand and make sure that our Senators make the right, necessary choices moving forward. With so many important battles ahead, we can't be pushed back so easily."
It appears that hundreds answered that call.
According to the Providence Journal, "The event also ended up happening a few hours after a hastily assembled rally protesting Trump's immigration moves, at which Whitehouse was a speaker. Hundreds who attended the rally then walked 1.5 miles to the [Providence middle school], but the crowd was so large it could not fit inside the auditorium."
In a YouTube video posted by the group Resist Hate RI, the wall-to-wall crowd is seen chanting "Just Say No!" and "Obstruct!" while one attendee tells Whitehouse: "If you don't agree with this candidate, vote against him."

Watch:
In response, Whitehouse told those inside, "You are entitled to an explanation of why I have voted for some of the defense nominees and I will concede right off the bat that I may have been wrong."
Afterwards, Whitehouse used a bullhorn to address the angry crowd outside, who wanted to know where they stand on Trump's remaining nominees. To loud cheers, Whitehouse ticked off those they would not be voting for: "Education, no. State, no. Attorney general, no. EPA director, really big no. Treasury, no. Labor, no."
"But much to the chagrin of several particularly vocal attendees, they could not commit to obstructing Trump or their nominees at every given opportunity," the Brown Daily Herald observed.
One voice from the crowd asked Whitehouse, "Can you take a message to Democratic legislators? The majority of the American people are behind them and we need them to lead bravely."
Whitehouse is just the latest Democratic lawmaker to be challenged for supporting Trump's agenda.
As Intercept report Lee Fang pointed out on Monday, "Activists around the country have increasingly called on Democratic lawmakers to do more to stop Trump's nominations. Last Tuesday, more than 100 demonstrators picketed Sen. Mark Warner's office in northern Virginia to protest the senator's support for Pompeo. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said their office received more than 50,000 emails and letters urging them to oppose the nomination of [Betsy] DeVos."
The latest Metroscopia poll showing voter intention among Spaniards, if general elections were to be held tomorrow.
Spain's political map has changed to make way for new forces that will play a major role in future decision-making, the latest voter intention survey shows.
An early March poll conducted by Metroscopia for EL PAIS shows that the Popular Party (PP) and the Socialist Party (PSOE), the two groups that have taken turns in government since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, will now have to share power with two strong newcomers.
The picture that emerges is one of unprecedented fragmentation, in which four parties are collectively attracting around 80 percent of the vote, but coming in so close that not one of them will secure enough support to govern single-handedly.
Podemos, Spain's new anti-austerity party, continues to lead the way in voter intention with 22.5 percent of the estimated vote, confirming a three-month-long trend despite a slight decline in support over the last quarter.
Another emerging force, Ciudadanos (C's), attracted 18.4 percent of the estimated vote, just two-tenths of a point less than the ruling PP. Meanwhile, the PSOE was backed by 20.2 percent of potential voters.
Political analysts are already talking about all kinds of potential cross-party agreements, either of a permanent nature or on a issue-by-issue basis.
But the parties themselves will not reveal their plans until after elections, which kick off on March 22 when Andalusians will be asked to elect their regional government.

The Andalusian elections are being cast as a preview of things to come when municipal and regional elections get underway elsewhere in the country. However, most of the focus is on the general elections scheduled for the fall, when Spaniards will confirm whether the political upheaval that's been widely forecast becomes a reality or not.
What appears to be indisputable is that after years of voter apathy, citizens are very motivated to cast their ballots, with 74.6 percent of survey respondents stating that they plan to go vote.
Regarding the need for cross-party agreements, 71 percent of those surveyed favored a scenario in which the most-voted party would seek support only on specific issues, not as a four-year-long coalition.
These deals could take many shapes, ranging from a coalition of leftist parties (Podemos, PSOE and United Left) all the way to a “grand coalition” between Spain's two traditional parties, PP and PSOE, despite their traditional antagonism.
Ciudadanos has rapidly risen in recent months to become Spain's fourth strongest political force in voter intention. PEPE TORRES EFE
As for Ciudadanos, the cross-party nature of its political program means that just as many of its supporters would back a coalition with the Socialists as would support a deal with the PP conservatives.
For now, most political leaders are expressing a willingness to reach across the aisle while falling short of discussing any specifics.
PSOE Secretary General Pedro Sánchez said they are ready to work with the PP on matters of state, such as the recent national plan against jihadism. “The PSOE is in better conditions than any other party to talk about pacts,” they said.
Meanwhile, Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias has said repeatedly that they will only work with the Socialists if the latter perform a U-turn. Iglesias recently reiterated their aversion to working with established parties: “You will not see me embracing [PM Mariano] Rajoy or [Catalan premier Artur] Mas.”
“A political map is coming up in which there will clearly be a need for agreements,” summed up Ciudadanos president Albert Rivera on Saturday. “How could we not, if the most-voted party gets 21 percent of the vote and we get 18.5 percent? Deals will have to be reached, but only to effect political, economic and social changes"
"[Citizens] will not allow us to come here to receive a nice little position or to keep a congressional seat warm," added Rivera. "We've come here to make changes. We're here to negotiate, not for wheeler-dealing.”
The five nuclear experts killed in a plane crash in northern Russia earlier this week had assisted in the design of an Iranian atomic facility, security sources in Russia said on Thursday.
The five Russian experts were among the 44 passengers killed when the Tupolev-134 plane broke up and caught fire on landing outside the northern city of Petrozavodsk on Monday.

The experts - who included lead designers Sergei Rizhov, Gennadi Benyok, Nicolai Tronov and Russia's top nuclear technological experts, Andrei Tropinov - worked at Bushehr after the contract for the plant's construction passed from the German Siemens company to Russian hands.
The five were employed at the Hydropress factory, a member of Russia's state nuclear corporation, and one of the main companies to contract for the Bushehr construction.
The sources said that the death of the scientists is a great blow to the Russian nuclear industry.

The experts were tasked with completing construction of the plant and ensuring that it would be able to survive an earthquake.
According to the sources, although Iranian nuclear scientists have in the past been involved in unexplained accidents and plane crashes, there is no official suspicion of foul play. Investigators are probing human error and technical malfunction as the causes of the crash.
A few months ago Aston Villa would have been happy with Premier League survival. Now they have a chance for so much more.
In recent years Villa have struggled to compete but they are a proper club. When I left Arsenal for Villa it was because I felt they shared similar traits - tradition, history and both took pride of place in their communities.
Villa were one of the founder members of the Football League and in the early years of the FA Cup, the trophy was almost theirs to keep. Now this group has a chance to embrace that history and write the next chapter.
Aston Villa celebrate in the Wembley dressing room after beating Liverpool to reach this year's FA Cup final
Martin Keown joined Aston Villa in 1986 and made the move because of the club's rich history and tradition
Tim Sherwood has invigorated this side and you can feel that improvement in their performances. But for all the excitement Villa fans must be patient.
Talking about getting a club ‘back where they belong' can be a dangerous game. Villa won the European Cup in 1982 and while there's nothing wrong with being ambitious, fans have to be realistic.
Previous generations at Villa have seen success and can be too demanding. Even when they were challenging for the Champions League under Martin O'Neill there were still rumblings of discontent.
When things do start to go wrong, Villa Park can be an unforgiving place. I experienced that when I was relegated and it can be a difficult place to play. But what ground isn't when things are going badly?
In the past Villa Park has been so loud players could hardly hear themselves think and the atmosphere the fans created at Wembley was magnificent. Now with Sherwood hopefully a generation can grow with theirs side.
Making the final is a fine achievement and Sherwood and their players will be desperate to become part of the fabric of a fantastic club.

This image from a NASA space shuttle mission shows the International Space Station in orbit. The space station is the size of a football field and home to six astronauts. Image taken: Feb. 10, 2010.
Update: NASA has reestablished contact with the International Space Station. For the latest news, read: NASA Restores Contact with Space Station
NASA lost direct contact with the International Space Station today (Feb. 19) due to equipment failure, leaving the orbiting laboratory dependent on Russian ground stations for communications with Earth, space agency officials say.
The communications loss occurred at 9:45 a.m. EST (1445 GMT) as flight controllers at NASA's Mission Control atthe Johnson Space Center in Houston were sending a software update to the space station. All six space station astronauts are in good health, and NASA is attempting to reestablish a connection with the station, NASA officials said. The space station is currently home to three Russians, two Americans and a Canadian astronaut.
As far as NASA officials can tell, the space station's loss of communications was unrelated to the software update, Kelly Humphries, a public affairs specialist at NASA told SPACE.com. It was a coincidence that the space agency lost contact with the station as the computers were being updated.
A main data relay system malfunctioned, and the computer that controls the station's critical functions switched to a backup, NASA officials said in a statement. However, the station was still was unable to communicate with the Tracking and Data Relay satellite network that serves as the outpost's link to NASA's Mission Control center on the ground.
"Mission Control Houston was able to communicate with the crew as the space station flew over Russian ground stations before 11:00 a.m. EST and instructed the crew to connect a backup computer to begin the process of restoring communications," NASA officials explained.
When mission control made contact with the International Space Station via Russian ground stations earlier today, Expedition 34 commander Kevin Ford reported on the health and status of the space station and its residents.
"Hey, just FYI, the station's still fine and straight, everybody is in good shape of course," said Ford in audio released by NASA. "And nothing unexpected other than lots of caution warning tones, and of course we have no system in sight. We'll get that back to you as soon as we can."
This is not the first time mission control has lost direct communication with the orbiting science laboratory. In 2010, the space station briefly lost communication with the gound when a primary computer failed and the backup had to take over. Communications were out for about one hour before NASA restored the connection.
The International Space Station is a $100 billion laboratory in space that is about the size of a football field. It has the living space equivalent of a five-bedroom home and was built by five difference space agencies representing the United States, Russia, Europe, Canada and Japan.
This story was updated at 12:50 p.m. ET to include new details about the communications failure.

Video description:
The 2008 Belgian Grand Prix (formally the LXIV ING Belgian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 September 2008 at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps near the town of Spa, Belgium. It was the 13th race of the 2008 Formula One season. The 44-lap race was won by Felipe Massa for the Ferrari team, after the initial winner, McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton, was penalised for cutting a chicane and gaining an advantage over Ferrari's Kimi Räikkönen. Hamilton started from pole position alongside title rival Massa. Hamilton's McLaren teammate Heikki Kovalainen started from third next to the 2007 winner Kimi Räikkönen. Following a spin by Hamilton on the second lap, Räikkönen led most of the race, until rain fell on lap 41 and Hamilton performed the penalised pass. Räikkönen crashed on the following lap as the rain became heavier. Massa finished second on the road after Hamilton, followed by Nick Heidfeld of BMW Sauber. Hamilton received a 25-second penalty, which demoted them to third place and advanced Massa and Heidfeld to first and second positions. McLaren appealed the decision at the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) International Court of Appeal. Their case, however, was declared inadmissible, with the Court ruling that 25 second penalties cannot be challenged. The penalty prompted global press discussion, primarily from the United Kingdom and Italy, with several former drivers questioning the decision. Massa's retroactive victory, with Hamilton demoted to third, narrowed the gap in the Championship from six points to just two (Wikipedia, 2017).

Image copyright AFP Image caption The BDO survey is the latest in a line of reports suggesting the economic recovery is gathering pace
Business optimism in the UK is at its highest level in 22 years, a survey by business consultants BDO has found.
The monthly report incorporates results of surveys from the CBI, the Bank of England's Agents and data from business information providers, Markit.
BDO said its optimism index, which predicts performance two quarters ahead, pointed to further improvements in the next six months.
It is the latest in a string of reports pointing to a strengthening recovery.
Last week, the National Institute of Social and Economic Research think tank, forecast the UK economy would grow by 2.5% this year, saying the recovery had become "entrenched".
Other forecasters, including the Office for Budget Responsibility, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have all become increasingly optimistic about the UK's economic prospects.
Muted pressures
BDO said the improving mood pointed to further falls in unemployment, with businesses' hiring expectations at their strongest since August 2008.
The latest figures showed unemployment fell to a rate of 7.1%.
A strengthening economy can lead to higher inflation, which can usher in higher interest rates to combat it.
But BDO said its survey suggested inflation pressures were muted, with its inflation index at its lowest level since November 2009.
There were few signs that wages would start to recover, with wages growth running at 0.9% last year, well under the rate of inflation.
Peter Hemington, a partner at BDO, said: "An interesting feature of the recovery so far has been the way in which UK productivity remains at levels last seen in late 2005. Looking at this optimistically, this means that the UK can continue to grow for some time by increasing productivity before wage-related inflationary pressures begin to kick in."
The findings echo those of a survey last week from the accountancy industry body, the ICAEW, which recorded its highest reading yet.
However, ICAEW also said there were concerns about the structure of the economy as export growth had failed.

SPACEX CHIEF ELON Musk has unveiled ambitious plans to establish a Mars colony by sending 100 humans at a time on massive spacecraft, possibly costing as low as $100,000 per person.
Taking the stage under a large globe of Mars at the International Astronautical Congress, Musk showed their vision for a giant rocket that would propel people to the Red Planet “in our lifetime”.
“We need to go from these early exploration missions to actually building a city,” they said to an overflow crowd at an expo center in the western Mexican city of Guadalajara.
Musk showed a futuristic video depicting their concept of an interplanetary transport system based on reusable rockets, a propellant farm on Mars and 1,000 spaceships on orbit, carrying about 100 people each.
The spacecraft would have a restaurant, cabins, zero-gravity games and movies.
“It has to be fun or exciting. It can't feel cramped or boring,” they said.

Eight years away
Musk later told reporters they were “optimistic” that the first human mission could leave Earth in 2024 and arrive on the Red Planet the following year.
Before that, SpaceX plans to send an unmanned Dragon cargo capsule to Mars as early as 2018.
The South Africa-born, Canadian-American entrepreneur said the plan would require a “huge public-private partnership”, but they did not announce any alliance with a government agency.
The first flight would be expensive but the aim is “making this affordable to almost anyone who wants to go,” by dropping the price of a ticket over time from $200,000 to $100,000 (€89,000 at today's rates), Musk said.
“You can't create a self-sustaining civilization on Mars if the ticket price is $10 billion per person,” they said.
It could also be deadly.
“I think the first trips to Mars are going to be really, very dangerous. The risk of fatality will be high. There is just no way around it,” they said. “It would basically be, ‘Are you prepared to die?' Then if that's ok, then you are a candidate for going.”

Setbacks
While SpaceX was hit by a setback on 1 September when its Falcon 9 rocket, after several successful missions and vertical landings, exploded on the launch pad during a test in Florida, Musk said “this is just a small thing on a long road”.
SpaceX is not alone in aspiring to travel to Mars.
The US space agency NASA, which is studying the effects of long-term space flight on the human body, has announced its own plans to send people to Mars by the 2030s.
Blue Origin, a company founded by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, also envisions a Mars mission, but decades from now.
Experts warn that reaching Mars – 225 million kilometers from Earth on average – and living there requires major engineering feats and a massive budget.
John Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, said Musk's presentation was “long on vision, short on detail”.
Musk did not explain in detail how they would get the “billions of dollars that would be required to put the vision into reality”.
The plan also faces technical challenges, such as refueling in orbit, which has never been done, and building fuel depots on Mars.

Very challenging
Chris Carberry, chief executive of Explore Mars Inc, a non-profit promoting the goal of sending humans to the planet within two decades, said a mission of just three to six people would cost between $80 billion and $120 billion.
Musk's presentation is “very inspiring, aspirational, but I think it's going to be very challenging to be able to accomplish this in 10 years”.
“I think it's probably more likely we're going to send a smaller mission to first figure out if people can live on Mars before we send 100 people there at a time,” they said.
Musk said the rocket would take a spaceship into orbit, release it and land back on Earth to pick up a fuel tanker, which it would fly to the craft to fuel its journey to Mars. The trip would one day take as little as three months, or even less than one month.
Once on Mars, humans would have to install a plant to produce propellant by using the planet's methane resources to fuel the spacecraft for its return to Earth.
SpaceX has achieved engineering breakthroughs, notably by successfully landing the Falcon 9 upright, which could cut space-travel costs by making rockets reusable.
Blue Origin has also built a rocket that lands vertically and is working on a taller launcher called New Glenn, but the company is focusing on sending people to Earth's low orbit for now.
“We want to have millions of people living and working in space in a decades timeframe if they want to,” Blue Origin president Rob Meyerson said.

And so the circle closes. Nearly seven months ago, on November 28, 2013, then Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had the chance to write history. The European Union was ready to sign the association agreement at the summit for the European Partnership initiative in Vilnius.
The document, negotiated as early as 2011, was meant to bind Ukraine to Europe economically, partly through a free trade zone. Yanukovych declined, citing economic pressure from Russia. But their decision triggered a protest movement that forced Yanukovych to flee to Russia at the end of February. On Friday (27.06.2014), their newly-elected successor, Petro Poroshenko signed the agreement at an EU summit in Brussels.
It is now all about the economic factor. The political association was sealed on March 21 by Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, when Brussels wanted to demonstrate solidarity with Ukraine, which lost part of its territory through Russia's annexation of the Crimean peninsula.
Pro-Russian separatists have declared the independence of Donetsk
Qualified joy, great hopes
Now Ukraine may lose more regions in its eastern half. After the association agreement was signed, Russian President Vladimir Putin said in Moscow that "attempts to impose an artificial choice between Europe and Russia have pushed society to a split, to a painful internal confrontation."
In Donetsk and Luhansk, pro-Russian separatists have declared their own "people's republics" and are locked in serious fighting with the Ukrainian army. Hundreds of people have already been killed. Kyiv accuses Moscow of supporting the separatists with weapons exports and irregular troops, and Poroshenko declared a week-long ceasefire, which was due to end on Friday at 9 a.m. and which the separatists publicly supported but ignored in practice. People are still being killed every day.
The events in the east have spoiled much of the Ukrainians' joy over the association agreement, though last winter hundreds of thousands carried European flags in demonstrations to support it. Nevertheless, this Friday represents a personal victory for Poroshenko, not least because they drove the negotiations towards the agreement when they were foreign and economy minister. "The first stage of our European integration is complete," they said recently.
The Kyiv government is hoping that economic help from Brussels and Western investment will soon follow. The country has been on the brink of bankruptcy for months and urgently needs billions in financial investment. Ukraine is also hoping that the association agreement will be a first step towards full EU membership. Brussels, however, is still insisting on keeping the two separate.
Georgia and Moldova
Two other former Soviet republics have also signed the association agreements in Brussels: Georgia and Moldova, also members of the EU's Eastern Partnership. The signing was due to take place at a later stage, but events in Ukraine have accelerated everything, say observers. Both politicians and citizens had recognized that "it makes no sense to bet on Russia," as Kakha Gogolashvili of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies (GFSIS), told DW. They believe the number of people who still believe in good relations with Russia is dropping.
"The most important thing is the general framework that gives us the opportunity for new reforms and new investments," says Pirkka Tapiola, director of the EU delegation in Moldova. Brussels, on the other hand, is mainly interested in closer economic ties that don't antagonize other countries.
After the signing, all three countries want to ratify the agreement in their parliaments as quickly as possible, so that it can come into power in autumn. Then Kyiv, Tbilisi, and Chisinau want to adapt their laws to the EU's. But the final ratification - by all 28 states - is likely to take years.
Moldova and Georgia also want closer EU ties
Looming trade war with Moscow
Even if Russia is not part of the EU summit in Brussels, a lot of people will be looking to see how Moscow reacts. About a year ago, Russia threatened Ukraine with serious consequences should Kyiv sign an association agreement with the EU. To lend weight to the threat, Russia temporarily stopped imports from Ukraine in August. "We have to assume that we're going to enter a trade war with Russia soon," Ukrainian Economy Minister Pavlo Sheremeta said in mid-June.
So far, Moscow has offered calmer tones. There won't be sanctions against Ukraine, said Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia would, however, introduce import duties for Ukrainian products in order to support the domestic market. "This will be a tough test for Ukraine," Putin warned.
For Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, the association agreement is the long-yearned-for exit from the Russian zone of influence. Moscow has been trying for years to bind the former Soviet countries into a new alliance - the Eurasian Union initiated by Putin. Without success. Now Brussels is forging its own alliances.
Months ago, Moscow was demanding a say in the signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU. Both Kyiv and Brussels rejected the idea - but now talks between Ukraine, the EU, and Russia about the effects of the agreement may happen in July - at least according to Russian news agency Interfax, citing an anonymous source in Brussels.
But Dr. Gilad said that when it was contacted, Princeton said there had been no sexual harassment investigation of Dr. Lieb while they were there. They said efforts to find out more about what prompted Dr. Lieb's departure proved fruitless. A Princeton spokesperson said the university does not comment on personnel matters.
Faculty at Chicago said that Dr. Lieb had told them during the interview process that Princeton faulted them for not informing them about a complaint of unwanted contact filed against them at North Carolina, where they had taught for 13 years. But they told them they had seen no reason to do so because the investigation had not found evidence to support the claim.
Subsequently, they gave permission to Princeton to examine their personnel file. Chicago, too, received permission to look at the file, Dr. Gilad said, adding that the examination of the records did not raise red flags.
Separately, Dr. Gilad acknowledged, during the interviews of Dr. Lieb, they admitted that they had had a monthslong affair with a graduate student in their laboratory at the University of North Carolina.
At Chicago, the hiring committee struggled, Dr. Gilad said, to balance a desire to protect students with a desire not to convict someone without evidence. They said Dr. Lieb had not been found guilty of any offense at North Carolina. The department of human genetics voted unanimously to hire him.
“It's hard to say this in retrospect,” Dr. Gilad said, “but what's the value of investigating anything if an unsubstantiated allegation itself invalidates the candidate?”
But Joe Thornton, a faculty member in the department who raised objections before the vote, said in an interview, “I don't think that's the right standard to use.” They added, “It may be a legal standard, but we should be capable of making more nuanced judgments about the environment we're creating for human beings that are doing and learning science.”
PRAGUE (Reuters) - These days artificial intelligence is so advanced that robots trade shares, make restaurants suggestions and diagnose diseases. But can a robot get a dance floor jumping?
It is a question that Prague's Karlovy Lazne Music Club has endeavored to answer by employing a specially adapted former automotive industry robot as a DJ in the popular nightspot.
The robot is shaped like a giant arm capped with a pincer, and has shared deck duties at the club with its human programmer in an hourly rotation each night for the last three weeks.
“People are excited (about the robot), because they haven't seen anything like this around Europe, and I am not sure if there is something similar in the world,” club manager Adam Lipsansky told Reuters.
The DJ robot was created after the club's management challenged a robotics firm to the task.
Equipped with special software to help it choose songs and mounted on a stage above the club's dance floor, the robot selects discs from nearby racks and puts them into one of three music players in front of it. It can scratch records and also dances.
While some clubbers told Reuters that they enjoyed the robot's musical efforts, others remained unconvinced.
“I don't like the robot,” said Marcia Lopes, 24, a tourist from Mexico. “It can't feel what the people want to dance to. There is no emotion behind the music. When there is a real person, they know, what fun is like.”

Finland is pushing ahead with a plan to test the effects of paying a basic income as it seeks to protect state finances and move more people into the labour market.
The Social Insurance Institution of Finland, known as Kela, will be responsible for carrying out the experiment that would start in 2017 and include 2,000 randomly selected welfare recipients, according to a statement released Thursday. The level of basic income would be €560 a month ($816 Canadian), tax free and mandatory for those picked.
RELATED: Basic income has its appeal, but it also has a very basic problem

"The objective of the legislative proposal is to carry out a basic income experiment in order to assess whether basic income can be used to reform social security, specifically to reduce incentive traps relating to working," the Social Affairs and Health Ministry said.
To asses the effect of a basic income, the participants will be held up against a control group, the ministry said. The target group won't include people receiving old-age pension benefits or students. The level of the lowest basic income to be tested will correspond with the level of labour market subsidy and basic daily allowance.
The idea of a basic income, or paying everyone a stipend, has gained traction in recent years. It was rejected in a referendum in Switzerland as recently as June, where the suggested amount was 2,500 francs ($3,338) for an adult and a quarter of that sum for a child. It has also drawn interest in Canada and the Netherlands.
Finnish authorities were clear on one thing as they embark on their study: "An experiment means that, at this point, basic income will not be paid to the whole population."
Trigger warning: The following contains references to PIV sex, gender, patriarchy, and cishets.
As a straight, white, cisgender male, I don't face the challenges that many women, minorities, or genderqueer do on a daily basis. My life is easy. I benefit from a patriarchal system that lends power and privilege to individuals with my characteristics. While I didn't ask for it, it is my duty to own it. I want to preface this article by acknowledging my privilege, and apologizing beforehand if I step out of line, or any of the following causes offense.
Despite my privilege, even I am faced with challenges. While my challenges do not hold a candle to say, my partner Gwendalin's (though we are lawfully married, we prefer not to use the traditional identifiers of “man” or “wife,” as they carry connotations of patriarchal ownership and rape culture) even the most underprivileged in our societal system, who are victims of white corporate oppression, may sympathize. I'm speaking, of course, about the disappointment of raising a child who subscribes to the traditional gender binary.
Gwen and I, despite our best efforts, are currently the parents of a cisgendered son.
A Night to Remember
Firstly, I should note that Gwen and I did not plan on having children. We have always been careful, and have regularly used the birth control they fought so hard to keep the Christian Right from taking away. Despite all the precaution, mistakes can happen, and one night it did happen to us.
Despite all the precaution, mistakes can happen, and one night it did happen to us.
It started innocently enough. The local university was holding seminars about the gender wage gap, and Gwendalin was a guest speaker. Them feminine wisdom is beyond my comprehension. Naturally, I attended, not only to support my partner, but to learn. As the beneficiary of a system that has institutionalized sexism and racism, it is important that the males take every opportunity to educate themselves on the privileges they enjoy at the expense of others. What better way to check that privilege than by sitting down, shutting up, and submitting yourself to the knowledge of the women closest to you?
Watching this raw display of feminine personhood on that stage, however, began to awaken dangerous desires within me. I began to have the problematic feeling of ownership one has in sexually active relationships. I felt ashamed. Here Gwen was, educating future world citizens about a very prominent and real example of a systematic oppression of women, and here I was perpetuating rape culture by being sexually turned on by my partner.
It didn't subside, either. Once we got home that night, I couldn't help myself, and I approached them as respectfully as I was able in my weakened state. “May I kiss you?” I asked them They looked at me in silence for moment, considering whether to give me permission. “Yes,” they finally said, and awaited me to approach them Our lips met, and I could tell the night was going to be one to remember.
A Hope for Change
I'll spare you the details, but that night there seemed to be no limits. I was overcome with a tidal wave of uninfluenced consent that celebrated and revered Gwen's independent sexuality.
It wasn't until some time later that we found out our consensual trist had gotten Gwen pregnant. I felt guilty. They had allowed me to participate in one of the most private and powerful aspects of their womanhood, and I had punished them for it with a child.
Abortion was the logical choice, and it seemed they were at a consensus until Gwen's gender studies professor friend arrived.
When we solemnly broke the news to our friends, they were sympathetic and caring. That night, the men sat quietly as the women discussed what Gwen was to do with the baby. Abortion was the logical choice, and it seemed they were at a consensus until Gwen's gender studies professor friend arrived.
“Things won't change until we create change.” they said. “Perhaps this child will be the first of many steps to making this world a more progressive, feminine place.”
The idea was simple. We were to raise the child in a gender-fluid, feminist environment. Xe would benefit from no privilege, and would live outside of the systematic controls placed on xer by society. Gwen loved the idea, and decided to bring the fetus to term. I was scared, but I trusted Gwen's wisdom and power.
For months, we prepared for the baby's arrival. We decided to give xer the name Pat, as we had yet to know what gender xe would decide on, and that would keep the option of Patrick or Patricia open to xer. We stocked bookshelves with bedtime stories like “My Princess Boy,” “Buddha at Bedtime,” and “Heather Has Two Mommies.” Somewhere between the organic diapers and the Liz Warren onesie, I started to feel excited, like a Progressive pioneer setting out to change the world as we knew it. Finally, I was effecting positive change in the world with something more substantial than a hashtag.
Another Opportunity to Triumph
When we found out later during an ultrasound that Pat was male-bodied, we were crushed. We had so badly wanted to have a girl. It wasn't until our feminist professor friend reminded us that society was more likely to listen to a male-bodied person that we saw this misfortune as an opportunity. The universe knew what it was doing, and Pat was being equipped with the necessary tools to spread the message far and wide. While we were faced with the hurdle of teaching Pat not to fall into the trap of systematic patriarchy, our success in shaping them successfully would be that much sweeter.
Under Gwen's direction, both Pat and I learned daily about not only the world, but ourselves.
When Pat was born, friends and family (at least members of the family who didn't practice problematic traditions) welcomed them to the world with love. Pat heralded the arrival of a new era, not just for Gwen and me, but for the world. Things, I thought, would really begin to change now.
As Pat grew, we dressed xer in pink dresses. The toy room was littered gender-neutral toys (and some feminine ones for good measure) we would use to teach and play. It was an amazing time for all of us. Under Gwen's direction, both Pat and I learned daily about not only the world, but ourselves. We were so careful not to allow any masculine influence into Pat's life, and I thought we had done well, but, as when we were careful before, it wasn't enough.
Unintended Consequences Yet Again
When Pat was two, we brought them to a friend's house where she, a single mother who participated in in-vitro, had given birth to a young girl around the same time as Gwen. They were raising their child in much the same manner as we were raising ours, and it seemed only natural to put the two together, although Gwen and I were wary of the toys our friend had bought for their daughter—a toy workbench complete with power tools, little bulldozers and trucks, and sports balls of all kind. We decided, against better judgement, to allow Pat to participate in activities that encouraged our friend's daughter to break from societal norms.
Before I could put my wine down and leap across the room to stop him, they had picked up the hammer and was banging it onto a toy nail.
Things were going smoothly until Pat's eyes locked onto the hammer at the toy workbench. Quietly, I watched as they left the company of the little girl where they had been playing with a soccer ball (due to the high number of homosexuals who play and enjoy soccer, we felt this was safe) and hobbled over to the workbench. Before I could put my wine down and leap across the room to stop him, they had picked up the hammer and was banging it onto a toy nail.
In that moment, Gwen and I watched as all our work began to slip away. “No!” I said, as I yanked the hammer out of their little hand. Pat looked at me, very confused, both of us unable to articulate just how awful what they did was. “Look!” I said, handing them an African-American doctor Barbie doll. They took it eagerly, and we all breathed with a sigh of relief. I walked away, confident that I had averted a crisis…until Gwen and our friend gave a terrified squeal.
I heard it before I saw it. The banging sound had returned, only when I spun around to look I saw with horror Pat using the African-American doctor Barbie as a hammer. Gwen did not allow me a second chance at fixing this. They tipped over the chair as they ran toward Pat. Yanking the doll out of their hand, they screamed “No!” repeatedly. We left quickly, not willing to risk any more male toxicity creeping into our child.
A World Shattered
We couldn't believe it. Not only had Pat exhibited masculine traits despite our best efforts, they had done so by using a woman as a tool, and an African-American woman no less. They were only two, and not only was they already a sexist, they were a racist. On the way home, Gwen rightly placed the blame on me. I sat quietly as I accepted their righteous anger, waiting for them to finish before I would apologize repeatedly. Them amazing wisdom and intuitivity rocked my very core as they screamed and scolded me, and I had to remind myself that I needed it.
Either way, it was clear that I had created, not a gender-fluid feminist, but a son.
I had failed society once again. Perhaps I had been too sloppy. Too careless. Perhaps it was from the times when I brought them into the men's restroom instead of the unisex room. Perhaps it was when I would take more groceries than Gwen when we were carrying them inside. Perhaps I didn't wear dresses and skirts in the house enough times. Either way, it was clear that I had created, not a gender-fluid feminist, but a son.
As time went on we attempted to correct their behavior, but to little avail. They hate wearing what they pigheadedly call “girl clothes.” Once, we caught them playing “army” with their dolls. In fact, just yesterday they informed us that they want a toy gun for Christmas. It shocked Gwen, a steady and powerful rock, into tears.
Perhaps I am writing this as a warning to those who are considering having children in a non-binary household. Perhaps I am writing this as an apology for my failure as an able-bodied, able-minded father. Perhaps it's both. Either way, I feel it important for you to hear this cautionary tale.
Both Gwen and I are ashamed, but working to accept our son's choices. We hold out hope, as Sally Kohn does, that our child will at least be gay. Perhaps during their adolescent years they will discover Tumblr, and that community will get the message across better than we. Every parent has high hopes for xer children, even in the face of severe disappointment and failure.
I apologize for my reckless procreation, and addition to the oppressive system that disadvantages women and minorities. This was not my intent, and though Gwen decided to give birth to Pat, I take responsibility for how they came out. Every microaggression, every misogynistic word, and every trans or homophobic thing they do should be laid at my feet. I, a patriarchal oppressor, created more patriarchy.
Please signal boost this, and learn from my family. Learn from my failures.
After being cleared recently to swing a bat and participating in drills at first base, St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Matt Adams has begun mixing in sprints to their rehab process from quad surgery.
“They showed me some video analysis of them running the other day–I was blown away at how good they were running, I think everybody was,” shared Mike Matheny prior to Friday's game. “It looked normal and actually running pretty hard.”
Adams has been on the disabled list since May 27th after suffering a quadriceps strain that required surgery.  They are scheduled to have a hard lift day and then another hard run day in the near future according to Matheny.
“It's going good,” agreed Adams. “Easing into the swings and not trying to over-do things. Just trying to keep crossing off the steps that we need to get back out there.”
“It feels good to swing. The first couple times swinging, you're going to feel it a little bit–but there's no pain. It's just tight because I haven't been swinging. Once I get that knocked out, it'll just go back to feeling normal.”
Besides running on the field, Adams has spent a great deal of time on the zero-gravity treadmill.
“Yeah, I'm using that a lot,” said Adams. “Lowering the body-weight stuff so the pressure's not on the joints so much. Doing some sprints on that as well, it's going good.”
Entering Friday's game, Adams has missed a total of 68 games this season due to the quad injury.

The trouble in Miami may go beyond the departed General Manager Jeff Ireland and offensive coordinator Mike Sherman.
A report from Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald suggests that there are deep problems within the team, and that the locker room doesn't think highly of the coaches.
“There's not great respect for the coaching staff there,” one person described as “a close associate of several Dolphins players” told Jackson.
Two other unnamed sources told Jackson similar things.
“Criticism of the coaches is consistent with everyone I talk to on the team,” one source said. “You have some assistants who weren't experienced or comfortable in their jobs. Some players said they didn't learn much. It's pretty disconcerting.”
Added another source, “There's not a lot of great teaching there.”
In fairness to Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin and their staff, we have no idea which players these unnamed sources are talking to, and we have no idea whether that's a majority opinion within the locker room — it could just be a few disgruntled Dolphins who are grousing about their coaches.
Or, it could be a sign of a significant problem in Miami. At the end of the season, with the playoffs on the line, the Dolphins looked like a team that had quit. These comments don't do anything to change the perception that the coaches aren't getting through to the players in Miami.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court heads into Monday, its last day of the current term, with two important questions so far unanswered: What's to become of President Donald Trump's travel ban and will 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy retire?
The court will also announce the remaining decisions of the term, including the fate of laws in 39 states that bar direct taxpayer aid to churches and the ability of the parents of a 15-year-old boy to sue the federal border agent who killed him.
The Justice Department has urged the justices to lift bans imposed by lower courts blocking enforcement of the president's executive order on travel. It called for a 90-day ban on issuing visas to citizens of Iran, Sudan, Syria, Libya, Somalia and Yemen who want to come to the US.
The administration argued that the measure had a legitimate national security purpose, allowing the government to assess the reliability of background information on visa applicants from six countries associated with terrorism.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Virginia, said the executive order amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination. Its ruling cited campaign statements by Trump, who originally called for a ban on Muslim immigration.
Separately, a panel of three judges from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said the order violated federal immigration laws that require a more substantial national security justification than the White House offered.
The Supreme Court is expected to announce whether it will take up the appeal of those lower court orders and, in the meantime, allow the government to enforce the executive order while the appeal is pending.
Speculation about a possible retirement by Kennedy also has been swirling for months, partly fueled by rumors. Sen. Charles Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairperson, said in April that they "would expect a resignation this summer," but added that they had no definitive information.

Kennedy will turn 81 in another month. A Ronald Reagan appointee, they have served on the Supreme Court for 29 years. Some friends say they have suggested that they might retire. But they have given no outward sign that they might, and they have hired their normal complement of law clerks for the coming term.
A Kennedy retirement would give Trump the ability to profoundly reshape the court. In many divisive cases, the court lineup tends to be four conservatives and four liberals, with Kennedy casting the fifth and deciding vote.
With Kennedy joining the conservatives, the court gutted the Voting Rights Act, reduced federal regulation of money in political campaigns, and declared that the Second Amendment provides an individual right to gun ownership.
Kennedy's votes with the liberals produced rulings striking down state laws against same-sex marriage, upholding abortion rights, and limiting the use of the death penalty.
"A Kennedy retirement would be an epic change," said Tom Goldstein, a Washington, D.C., lawyer and publisher of SCOTUSblog. "Kennedy is a conservative but has moderate tendencies. A replacement chosen by President Trump would give conservatives the solid majority on the court they've been hoping for since the Nixon administration."
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 84, and Stephen Breyer, 78, have shown no signs that they intend to step down.
Also Monday, the court will likely announce whether it will take or reject several appeals that have been piling up for months, including the right to carry a gun outside the home and whether businesses can refuse to provide their services for same-sex marriage ceremonies.
This content describes the prevalence of overweight and obesity in the United States.
Defining Overweight and Obesity
A person whose weight is higher than what is considered as a normal weight adjusted for height is described as being overweight or having obesity.1
Fast Facts
According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2013–20142,3,4,5
More than 1 in 3 adults were considered to be overweight.
More than 2 in 3 adults were considered to be overweight or have obesity.
More than 1 in 3 adults were considered to have obesity.
About 1 in 13 adults were considered to have extreme obesity.
About 1 in 6 children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 were considered to have obesity.
Using Body Mass Index (BMI) to Estimate Overweight and Obesity
BMI is the tool most commonly used to estimate and screen for overweight and obesity in adults and children. BMI is defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. For most people, BMI is related to the amount of fat in their bodies, which can raise the risk of many health problems. A health care professional can determine if a person's health may be at risk because of their or their weight.

Children and Adolescents
BMI of Children and Adolescents Ages 2 to 19 BMI Classification At or above the 85th percentile on the CDC growth charts Overweight or obesity At or above the 95th percentile on the CDC growth charts Obesity (including extreme obesity) At or above 120 percent of the 95th percentile on the CDC growth charts Extreme obesity
Children grow at different rates at different times, so it is not always easy to tell if a child is overweight. The CDC BMI growth charts are used to compare a child's BMI with other children of the same sex and age. It is important that a child's health care provider evaluates a child's BMI, growth, and potential health risks due to excess body weight.

Causes and Health Consequences of Overweight and Obesity
Factors that may contribute to weight gain among adults and youth include genes, eating habits, physical inactivity, TV, computer, phone, and other screen time, sleep habits, medical conditions or medications, and where and how people live, including their access to healthy foods and safe places to be active.1,6
Overweight and obesity are risk factors for many health problems such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, joint problems, and gallstones, among other conditions.1,6,7

H. Beatty Chadwick has been in a staring match with the judicial system for the past 14 years, and the system just blinked. Chadwick was ordered to pay their ex-wife $2.5 million after their divorce. They refused to pay saying that they couldn't because they lost the money in a series of "bad investments." The judge in the case didn't believe them and sent them to jail for contempt. That was 14 years ago . Last week another judge let Chadwick go saying that "continued imprisonment would be legal only if there was some likelihood that ultimately they would comply with the order; otherwise, the confinement would be merely punitive instead of coercive." Chadwick, now 73, is believed to have served the longest contempt sentence in US history.
Cheating in school tests is an old Indian problem.
But the malpractice literally scaled new heights this week in the eastern state of Bihar when relatives of 10th-grade students climbed the wall of a school building and perched precariously from windows of classrooms as they handed cheat sheets to children writing the tests inside.
Photographs and videos showing parents, friends and others scaling the school wall — Spiderman-style — went viral in India on Thursday. Police officers standing nearby watched helplessly.
Scores of friends and family were caught helping Indian students cheat on state exams, which are seen as make-or-break tests that could transform the lives of millions growing up in poverty. (Reuters)
Family values, some called it on Twitter. It does take a village, another said.
@amitbjo That's true, but cheating in UP, Bihar has acquired cultural acceptance, those solving questions celebrated as Heroes in localities — Chandra Bhan Prasad (@cbhanp) March 19, 2015
Videos also showed school inspectors slapping young girls as they pulled out cheat sheets from under their tables.
Parental guidance, Bihar style. Parents help class 10 students in large-scale cheating http://t.co/4L7xuOoVrQ pic.twitter.com/OI0iFEI8bd — NDTV (@ndtv) March 19, 2015
Cheating is common in schools in remote rural areas in India, where jobs and seats in college courses are few but competition is fierce. But the sight of parents risking their lives and limbs to climb the walls shocked many Indians.
Under Bihar's anti-cheating law, dozens of 12th-grade students were expelled and their parents detained last month in cases of cheating in tests.
Many students in India drop out of school because they fail to pass the tough standardized tests in their 10th and 12th grades.
Education experts say that cheating is just a symptom of the deeper problems that plague India's education system, such as teacher absenteeism, emphasis on rote learning and inadequate school infrastructure.
A recent study by the Pratham Education Foundation showed that only 48 percent of fifth-grade students could read a second-grade textbook.
“According to the reports we received, there have been complaints about cheating in many places, especially in rural areas,” P.K. Sahi, education minister of Bihar, told reporters on Thursday. “Is this just the responsibility of the government? Is it possible for the government to conduct fair tests without public support? You tell us what can the government do to stop cheating if parents and relatives are not ready to cooperate?”
Authorities expelled nearly 500 students from the tests, according to local media reports.

Blind Tom Wiggins, 1880
Thomas "Blind Tom" Wiggins (May 25, 1849 – June 14, 1908) was an African American musical prodigy on the piano. They had numerous original compositions published and had a lengthy and largely successful performing career throughout the United States. During the 19th century, they were one of the best-known American performing pianists. Although they lived and died before autism was described, they are now regarded as an autistic savant.
Early life [ edit ]
Wiggins was born on the Wiley Edward Jones Plantation in Harris County, Georgia. Blind at birth, they were sold in 1850 along with their enslaved parents, Charity and Domingo "Mingo" Wiggins, to a Columbus, Georgia, lawyer, General James Neil Bethune.[1] Bethune was "almost the pioneer free trader" in the United States and "the first [newspaper] editor in the south to openly advocate secession".[2] General Bethune renamed the child Thomas Greene Bethune or Thomas Wiggins Bethune (according to different sources).
Because Tom was blind, they could not perform work normally demanded of slaves, their owners originally wanted to kill them since they had no economic value to them. Instead, they were left to play and explore the Bethune plantation. At an early age, they showed an interest in the piano after hearing the instrument played by Bethune's daughters. By age four they reportedly had acquired some piano skills by ear, and gained access to the piano. By age five Toms reportedly had composed their first tune, The Rain Storm, after a torrential downpour on a tin roof.[3] With their skills recognized by General Bethune, Tom was permitted to live in a room attached to the family house, equipped with a piano. Neighbor Otto Spahr, reminiscing about Tom in the Atlanta Constitution in 1908 (as reproduced in The Ballad of Blind Tom, by Deirdre O'Connell), observed: "Tom seemed to have but two motives in life: the gratification of their appetite and their passion for music. I don't think I exaggerate when I state that they made the piano go for twelve hours out of twenty-four."[4]
As a child, Tom began to echo the sounds around him, repeating accurately the crow of a rooster or the singing of a bird. If they were left alone in the cabin, Tom was known to begin beating on pots and pans or dragging chairs across the floor in an attempt to make any kind of noise. By the age of four, Tom was able to repeat conversations up to ten minutes in length but was barely able to adequately communicate their own needs, resorting to grunts and gestures.
Another example of Tom's extraordinary abilities was shown after they were taken to a political rally in 1860 in support of Democratic presidential candidate Stephen Douglas. Years after they attended this speech, they were still able to repeat it while capturing the tone and mannerisms of Douglas. Additionally, they were able to recreate the heckles and cheers of the crowd with remarkable precision.[5]
Bethune hired out "Blind Tom" from the age of eight years to concert promoter Perry Oliver, who toured them extensively in the US, performing as often as four times a day and earning Oliver and Bethune up to $100,000 a year, an enormous sum for the time,[6] "equivalent to $1.5 million/year [in 2004], making Blind Tom undoubtedly the nineteenth century's most highly compensated pianist".[7] General Bethune's family eventually made a fortune estimated at $750,000 at the hands of Blind Tom.[8] Oliver marketed Tom as a "Barnum-style freak" advertising the transformation from animal to artist. In the media, Tom was frequently compared to a bear, baboon, or mastiff.
Bethune hired professional musicians to play for Tom, who could faithfully reproduce their performances, often after a single listening. Eventually they learned a reported 7,000 pieces of music, including hymns, popular songs, waltzes, and classical repertoire.
Professional career [ edit ]

Blind Tom circa 1861
There are conflicting historical accounts of Blind Tom's first public performance, some indicating they were as young as three. One account from 1857 indicates that they had been performing publicly for several years. Newspaper reviews and audience reactions were favorable, prompting General Bethune to undertake a concert tour with Tom around their home state of Georgia. Tom later toured the South with Bethune or accompanied by hired managers, though their travels and bookings were sometimes hampered by the North-South hostilities which were drawing the nation towards Civil War. In 1860, Blind Tom performed at the White House before President James Buchanan; they were the first African-American to give a command performance at the White House. Mark Twain attended many of Blind Tom's performances over several decades and chronicled the proceedings.
On- and off-stage, Tom often referred to themselves in the third person (e.g., "Tom is pleased to meet you"). Their piano recitals were augmented by other talents, including uncanny voice mimicry of public figures and nature sounds. They also displayed a hyperactive physicality both onstage and off. A letter written in 1862 by a soldier in North Carolina described some of Tom's eccentric capabilities: "One of their most remarkable feats was the performance of three pieces of music at once. They played 'Fisher's Hornpipe' with one hand and 'Yankee Doodle' with the other and sang 'Dixie' all at once. They also played a piece with their back to the piano and their hands inverted." At concerts, skeptics attempted to confirm if Tom's performance replications were mere trickery; their challenge took the form of having Tom hear and repeat two new, uncirculated compositions. Tom did so perfectly. The "audience challenge" eventually became a regular feature of their concerts.
Supposedly, Tom's talents profited the Confederacy during the Civil War. Their most famous song, "The Battle of Manassas", is the story of the Confederate Army's 1861 victory at the Battle of Bull Run. As a result, many black newspapers refused to celebrate him, pointing out that they served to reinforce negative stereotypes about African-American individuals and that they were only a source of profit for slaveholders.
In 1866, at age 16, Tom was taken on a European concert tour by General Bethune, who collected testimonials about Tom's natural talents from composer-pianist Ignaz Moscheles and pianist-conductor Charles Hallé. These were printed in a booklet, "The Marvelous Musical Prodigy Blind Tom", and used to bolster Tom's international reputation.
In 1875, General Bethune transferred management of Blind Tom's professional affairs to their son John Bethune, who accompanied Tom on tour around the U.S. for the next eight years. Beginning in 1875, John brought Blind Tom to New York each summer. While living with John in a boarding house on the Lower East Side, Tom added to their repertoire under the tutelage of Joseph Poznanski, who also transcribed new compositions by Tom for publication. Many of these were, at Tom's insistence, published under such pseudonyms as Professor W.F. Raymond, J.C. Beckel, C.T. Messengale, and Francois Sexalise.
Tom's piano-playing behavior, both during practice and performance, was eccentric. "We had two pianos in one room", Poznanski told the Washington Post in 1886 (as recounted in O'Connell's biography). "I would play for them and they would get up, walk around, stand on one foot, pull their hair, knock their head against the wall, then sit down and play a very good imitiation of what I had played with additions to it. Their memory was something prodigious. They never forgot anything." This led some critics to dismiss Tom as a novelty act, a "human parrot." Novelist Willa Cather, writing in the Nebraska State Journal, called Tom "a human phonograph, a sort of animated memory, with sound producing power."[4]
John Steinbeck has compared the main character in a short story of his, "Johnny Bear", to Blind Tom.
No original recordings of Blind Tom appear to exist. Their sheet music is available, but only a small number of musicians have ever recorded their original songs.
Custody battle [ edit ]
In 1882, John Bethune married their landlady, Eliza Stutzbach, who had demonstrated a knack for mollifying Tom's sometimes volatile temperament. However, shortly after their marriage, John Bethune embarked on an extended tour of the U.S. with Tom, in effect abandoning Eliza. When Bethune returned home eight months later, their wife filed for divorce. The couple split up—John took Tom—but a bitter legal squabble ensued, with Eliza hounding John for financial support, a claim that the courts usually adjudicated in John's favor. After John Bethune died in a railway accident in 1884, Tom was returned—over Eliza's objections—to the care of General Bethune (now living in Virginia). Eliza sued General Bethune for custody, with Tom's elderly mother Charity enjoined by Eliza's attorney as a party in the plaintiff's suit. After a protracted custody battle in several courts, in August 1887 Tom was awarded to Eliza, who moved Tom back to New York. Charity accompanied them with the understanding that they would benefit financially from Tom's earnings. However, after it became apparent that Eliza did not intend to honor any financial obligations to Charity, Tom's mother returned to Georgia.
Tom continued performing and touring for a number of years under the management of Eliza and their attorney (and later husband) Albrecht Lerche. Tom was on tour in western Pennsylvania in May 1889 on the day of the Johnstown Flood, and rumor spread that they were among the casualties. Despite their continued appearances on the U.S. concert circuit, the rumor persisted for years, with some observers expressing skepticism that the Blind Tom who appeared in concert after 1889 was the "real Blind Tom".
In this phase of their career, Tom usually introduced themselves onstage in the third person, imitating the pronouncements of their various managers from years past. They talked about their mental state with a characteristic lack of self-awareness. They had been diagnosed as non compos mentis by a doctor, and in their foggy netherworld the phrase was a matter of personal pride. Willa Cather described the poignance of one such concert: "It was a strange sight to see them walk out on stage with their own lips—another man's words—introduce themselves and talk quietly about their own idiocy. There was insanity, a grotesque horribleness about it that was interestingly unpleasant. One laughs at the man's queer actions, and yet, after all, the sight is not laughable. It brings us too near to the things that we sane people do not like to think of."
Tom was still traveling, and presumably still performing, in 1894. On July 5 of that year, they arrived in Grand Junction, Colorado, on their way eastward from California. The trainmen at that place were on strike against the railroads as part of the Pullman Strike, and Tom was stuck in town until July 9, when they continued eastward via the Colorado Midland Railroad.[9]
After being dogged by incessant legal challenges to their custodianship of Tom, Eliza took Tom off the concert circuit in the mid-1890s.
Later years [ edit ]
General James N. Bethune and Blind Tom
Tom spent the next ten years as a ward of Eliza and their husband, who divided their time between New York City and New Jersey's Navesink Highlands. In 1903 Eliza arranged for Tom to appear on the popular vaudeville circuit, beginning with Brooklyn's Orpheum Theater. They spent almost a year performing in vaudeville, before their health began to deteriorate. It is believed they suffered a stroke (described in some reports as "partial paralysis") in December 1904, which ended their public performing career.
After the death of their husband, Eliza relocated to Hoboken, New Jersey, with Tom.[10] They kept out of public view, though neighbors could hear Tom's piano playing at all hours of the day and night. Tom suffered a major stroke in April 1908, and died the following June. They were buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York.[11]
Posthumous recognition [ edit ]
The people of Columbus, Georgia, raised a commemorative headstone for them in 1976. They were the subject of a play titled HUSH: Composing Blind Tom Wiggins, by Robert Earl Price, which was performed on the Atlanta stage with Del Hamilton as director.
Between 1970 and 2000, Dr. Geneva Handy Southall wrote a three-volume thesis titled Blind Tom: The Black Pianist Composer; Continuously Enslaved; it was published by Scarecrow Press in 2002.
In 1981 they were the subject of a film, Blind Tom: The Story of Thomas Bethune, directed by Mark W. Travis.
In 1999 John Davis recorded an album of Tom's original compositions on a CD entitled John Davis Plays Blind Tom. The CD package included essays by Amiri Baraka, Ricky Jay and Oliver Sacks.
In 2006, Reagan Grimsley published an article about preserving the sheet music of Blind Tom for future Generations. Titled "Discovering "Blind" Tom Wiggins: Creating Digital Access to Original Sheet Music at the Columbus State University Archives", it appeared in Music Reference Quarterly.
A full-length biography, The Ballad of Blind Tom, by Deirdre O'Connell was published by Overlook Press in 2009.[4]
Andre T. Regan's 2013 documentary, The Last Legal Slave in America, documents the life and times of Blind Tom.
The Elton John song "The Ballad of Blind Tom", from their 2013 album The Diving Board, is about Blind Tom.
Blind Tom Wiggins is the subject of a novel, The Song of the Shank, (2014) by Jeffrey Reynard Allen.[12]
Blind Tom Wiggins is also the subject in a sequence of poems in Olio (2016) by Tyehimba Jess.
Editor's note: This story has been updated throughout.
U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, is not ruling out challenging U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in 2018, but he's emphasizing that they are not focused on it for now.
"Like Reagan said, never say never, but it's not something I'm spending a whole lot of time thinking about right now," McCaul told reporters Wednesday in Austin.
McCaul, the House Homeland Security Committee chairperson, has been encouraged to take on Cruz following the Texas senator's controversial showing last month at the Republican National Convention, where Cruz declined to endorse GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Speaking with reporters at a book signing, McCaul acknowledged that "a lot of people" have urged them to challenge Cruz and said they were flattered by their support, but stressed they have nothing to do with the effort.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"It's, I think, been sort of organic, an effort to draft, if you will," said McCaul, who is advising Trump on national security. "But right now I'm really focused on my re-election to the Congress. I'm focused on advising the nominee to regain the White House and also maintaining a majority in the House of Representatives, which is critically important to the nation."
“ Like Reagan said, never say never, but it's not something I'm spending a whole lot of time thinking about right now. ” — U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, on a potential 2018 run for the Senate
Asked whether they have been satisfied with Cruz's tenure in the Senate, McCaul said Cruz has "for the most part spent a lot of time running for president."
"I think they also represent the state of Texas in the Senate," McCaul told reporters. "I think that's an important job as well, and so I think the presidential campaign's over and it's time to — I think governance is important. I think in Washington getting things for the great people of Texas done is an important job."
Pressed on whether they were suggesting Cruz has not always been focused on Texas, McCaul replied, "Again, I think he's been focused on their ambition running for president."
A poll released Wednesday shows McCaul would face an uphill battle against Cruz in 2018. The Texas senator would beat McCaul by 32 points, according to the survey from the Democratic-leaning firm Public Policy Polling.
Cruz has nonetheless angered some Texas Republicans by withholding their support for Trump, their former bitter rival in the primaries. Asked how Cruz's convention speech affected their standing in the state GOP, McCaul said they think “initially not well” but acknowledged it could depend on how Trump fares in November.

"Traditionally, you support your nominee for president, and so when I went to Cleveland, I gave a strong speech about Hillary Clinton and their devastating foreign policy, but also in the support of the nominee,” McCaul said. "I think that's an obligation that we have to support the nominee.”
McCaul spoke repeatedly of their role advising Trump on national security, saying at the book signing that it has not been an easy job. But they praised a recent anti-terrorism speech by Trump as “fairly effective” and “carefully crafted,” and they insisted they could not trust Clinton on national security.
Speaking with reporters, McCaul said they plan to use their advisory role to push Trump to change their posture toward Russia. Trump has been unusually friendly toward the country's leader, Vladimir Putin.
“I think where they could use better advice would be with Mr. Putin and Russia,” McCaul said. "I don't think Mr. Putin has our best interests at heart."

2015 Giulia and new logo introduction.
Opinion
At first glance it's hard to discern the changes on the new logo but (almost) every one of them is a surprising improvement. The previous logo was evenly split with the cross taking up half the space and the man-eating-snake the other half (forcing the snake to be smaller). Now, the snake breaks past its half and occupies the full inner circle and touching the stroke on the top and bottome, creating a very nice flow. The double strokes of the previous snake have been cleaned up, so its body and mouth are crisper while the poor man has also been streamlined. Even the crown got the minimalist editing and lost some dots and a couple of lines. The resulting image is so much easier to read and has more impact. The typography could be a lot better than the poorly spaced, semi-flared serif chosen and that last "O" really got the shaft, but at the very least the type breathes better with the more extended structure. Overall, a great improvement (despite the type), even the chrome shading and realistic textures.

A rare court win for the NSSF and SAAMI in their effort to block California's microstamping law. Here's the NSSF's press release:
NEWTOWN, Conn – A California Appellate Court has reversed the Fresno Superior Court's dismissal of the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) and the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI) lawsuit seeking an injunction to block enforcement of the state's ammunition microstamping law and remanded the case back to the lower court to hear arguments.
“We are pleased by today's ruling because it means we will now be able to prove in court that this ill-considered law must be enjoined because it is literally impossible to comply with its requirements, and the law never requires the impossible. We have long maintained that this nascent, unproven and unreliable technology should not have been mandated. When we ultimately prevail in this case, law-abiding consumers in California will once again be able to purchase new models of pistols this law currently prevents our industry members from selling in the state,” said Lawrence G. Keane, NSSF Senior Vice President and General Counsel.
NSSF and SAAMI filed the lawsuit on behalf of their members against the State of California in Fresno Superior Court seeking to block the enforcement of the state's microstamping law, violations of which are a criminal offense. The state statute enacted in 2007, but not made effective until May 2013, requires that all new models of semiautomatic handguns sold in the state had to be designed to incorporate this unproven and unreliable microstamping technology.
Under this law, firearms manufacturers would have to micro laser-engrave a gun's make, model and serial number on two distinct parts of each handgun so that, in theory, this information would be imprinted on the cartridge casing when the pistol is fired.
“There is no existing microstamping technology that meets the requirement of this ill-considered law. It is not technologically possible to microstamp two locations in the gun and have the required information imprint onto the cartridge casing. In addition, the current state of the technology cannot reliably, consistently and legibly imprint on the cartridge primer the required identifying information from the tip of the firing pin, the only possible location where it is possible to micro-laser engrave the information,” said Keane.
In 2007, California Assembly Bill 1471 was passed and signed into law requiring microstamping on internal parts of new semiautomatic pistols. The legislation provided that this requirement would only become effective if the California Department of Justice certified that the microstamping technology is available to more than one manufacturer unencumbered by patent restrictions. The California legislature subsequently reorganized certain statutes concerning the regulation of firearms, including the microstamping law in 2010. On May 17, 2013, Attorney General Kamala D. Harris provided such certification. Harris was elected to the U.S. Senate in November.

Ken Cuccinelli, an “issue of special concern to women.”
Photo by Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images
One of the funniest Facebook posts I read Tuesday morning came from an Arlington, Va., voter who simply quoted their 5-year-old daughter telling their kindergarten teacher that their mom and dad were “voting for the man who doesn't think women are stupid.” I also liked Laura Galgano, the owner of a local diner, who simply posted: “That's right. I voted. With my lady parts.” Or John Higgins: “Today, Virginia voters will decide the future of oral sex in their state.” My friend Lisa posted, “Cuccinelli: bad for vaginas, oops bad for Virginia.”
There will be a lot of finger-pointing and blame-throwing about Virginia's gubernatorial race in the coming weeks, mainly in the key of regret (and relief, from the McAuliffe camp): Depending on what you feel like hollering about, Ken Cuccinelli's loss proves that the Tea Party has had its day, that money is the only thing that counts, that you can't govern from the extreme right in a purple state, and that they were tragically saddled with their crazy-talking lieutenant governor, E.W. Jackson. Blame will be ladled out to Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis, who will pull a not-insignificant proportion of votes from the right; to the government shutdown, which soured some Republican Virginia voters on the Tea Party; and to the Virginia ethics scandal, which swept in Cuccinelli with the gifting and the vacationing.
But don't let that distract from what really happened in Virginia on Tuesday: an official who consistently used their elected office to promote policies that shamed, marginalized, and patronized women and other minorities was met with a “no.” This wasn't just about money, or the shutdown, or Star Scientific, or Terry McAuliffe's fancy Clinton-era friends. It was about voters and what they know to be true. The vote may have been close, but in the end Virginians, especially women, showed that they simply don't believe that the commonwealth of Virginia should be in the business of discriminating against homosexuals, legislating an extreme anti-sodomy agenda, shuttering Planned Parenthood clinics, pressing an invasive transvaginal ultrasound law, and supporting a draconian illegal immigration law.
You can dismiss all the Virginians—men and women—who posted on Facebook today about their lady parts, and their aversion to forced ultrasounds, and the weird feeling they get when the state regulates consensual sodomy as silly sheep who were led astray by an expensive McAuliffe smear campaign. But most of them knew a year ago, sometimes much earlier than that, what Gov. Cuccinelli would mean for their freedom to do what they wanted, with whom they wanted, without government's oversight.
Cuccinelli was proudly and self-avowedly one of the most activist attorneys general the commonwealth had ever seen. From the very outset, their political ambition was to impose upon the state a social and religious code that may have made perfect sense to him, their supporters, and their conscience but came across as extreme, hateful, and intrusive to most everyone else. It didn't help that Cuccinelli then had to combine their fate with that of the unfortunate E.W. Jackson, who calls Democrats “anti-Christian, anti-Bible, anti-family, anti-life, and anti-God.” But long before Jackson came along, Cuccinelli was on the record opposing abortion for survivors of rape and incest, refusing to support the Violence Against Women Act, browbeating state entities into closing abortion clinics, denying equal protection for gay workers at state schools, and insisting that unconstitutional state sodomy laws need to stay on the books to protect children. They endorsed “personhood” laws that would have limited access to at least some forms of birth control. They urged people to go to jail to protest women's access to contraception. They have pushed to keep state funding for sex education focused on “abstinence-only” programs and favored putting armed guards in schools after Sandy Hook. And women who may have balked at any of that eventually tended to balk at him.
In a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday, Cuccinelli trailed McAuliffe by six percentage points, but female voters broke for McAuliffe by a 14-point margin. An October Washington Post–SRBI poll found voters trusting McAuliffe by 57 percent to 30 percent to handle “issues of special concern to women.” That's not a surprise. Whether you want to call it a war on women or just a battle over who gets to decide what's truly important to women, most female voters don't want the government telling them what women care about and who's going to regulate it.
Throughout the campaign, Cuccinelli has insisted that they are not attempting to push radical legislation on women, that the criticisms are all lies. As recently as Monday, their spokesperson charged that Vice President Joe Biden's recent statements about Cuccinelli's record on women “encapsulates a campaign for governor on the part of Democrats littered with absurdities and falsehoods.” Cuccinelli thought that by continuing to insist that their approach didn't shame and marginalize women and minorities, it would magically come to be true. They ran ads featuring an African-American woman calling McAuliffe's attacks on their social stances “ridiculous.” They repeatedly claimed that McAuliffe was lying about their record. Here is Mallory Quigley, media coordinator for a pro-Cuccinelli group, Women Speak Out Virginia, asserting that “these ads lie about [Cuccinelli's] record and insult women by reducing them to only a few issues,” thus, reducing women to only them issues.
In recent weeks, Cuccinelli has tried to deflect attention from their radical attacks on women's reproductive privacy by claiming that they did lots of important work to protect women from domestic violence and human trafficking. They did, and they should be credited for that. But therein lies the problem: Government acting to “protect” women is only half the story. Trusting them is the other half, and that's the part that's gone missing here in Virginia and around much of the country in recent years.
Ken Cuccinelli never, ever seemed to understand that all the phony Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws used to close abortion clinics and the mandatory ultrasounds and the bogus counseling and the clinic closures and the other policies styled as “protection” for Virginia's vulnerable women are not protective. They are condescending. And pretextual. Most women know that policies and laws aimed at protecting them when they are vulnerable (like VAWA) are not comparable or interchangeable with laws that treat them as incapable of making autonomous, informed choices about abortion and birth control.
Virginia women, who were mostly affronted by talk of transvaginal ultrasounds and clinic closures and constraints on birth control, know a whole lot about what they need to be protected from and when. And today they voted to “protect” themselves from Ken Cuccinelli.
Head of UN office on drugs and crime Antonio Maria Costa says Afghan gangs and Taliban stockpiling drug to manipulate street price in the west
The United Nations' drugs czar told Nato that Afghan insurgents were withholding thousands of tonnes of heroin and treating their drugs like "savings accounts" to manipulate street prices in the west, according to a leaked US cable.
Antonio Maria Costa, head of the UN's office on drugs and crime, told Nato representatives that the Taliban and organised crime gangs had withheld 12,400 tonnes of opium from the international market to keep the price of heroin and opium at a profitable level. The opium allegedly withheld by insurgents was worth around $1.25bn (£800m). Each tonne of opium is said to be worth around $100,000 and can be used to produce 100kg of heroin.
The US cable appears to show that the UN believed that the Taliban and other insurgents in Afghanistan were well-organised, aware of the market and focused on maintaining a viable price for the drug.
Reports on the Taliban's involvement in the drug trade from 2009 have focused on the splits between different drug gangs in Afghanistan and highlighted their fierce rivalries.
Costa's claims, reported in a confidential document, were expressed at a meeting on 18 September 2009. They were briefing Nato and its partners on the results of the 2009 Afghanistan Survey, the UN's annual assessment of the drugs industry in the country.
Afghanistan is the world's biggest exporter of heroin and opium most of which is grown in Helmand province, where British troops continue to lose their lives.
Under the heading "Opium Stocks Remain High", the cable states: "Costa said that Afghanistan has 12,400 tonnes of opium stocks because it produces more than the world consumes. Costa believes that the insurgency is withholding these stocks from the market and treating them like 'savings accounts'. They said the stocks pose a serious threat as it could be used to finance the insurgency. Costa encourage intelligence organizations to to keep focus on the storage and movement of Afghanistan's opium stocks."
Costa's reported opinion was not part of the UN's final 2009 Afghanistan Survey.
According to the cable, opium trends were positive overall and showcased a major decline in opium cultivation – by 22% in 2009, the lowest in 15 years.
"Costa said that even though Afghanistan was among the most impoverished countries in the world poverty was not the main factor. Costa said abandoning opium cultivation dies not produce humanitarian crisis. They said market forces caused a shift in opium prices and could easily influence farmers to grow ilicit crops if high market prices and revenue could be gained from them," the cable said.
Costa retired from their UN position earlier this year. They prompted an international debate when they claimed billions of pounds of laundered drug money from organised crime had been used to prop up many of the world's major financial institutions during the financial downturn.
According to the UN's 2010 Afghanistan survey, the total 2010 opium production is estimated at 3,600 metric tonnes, down 48% from 2009. The decrease was largely due to a plant infection hitting the major poppy-growing provinces of Helmand and Kandahar particularly hard. As a result of the damage, yield fell to 29.2kg per hectare, from 56.1kg per hectare compared with the previous year.
This year's survey has acknowledged that Afghan drug lords have previously stockpiled some drugs. About 87% of total opium production took place in the south and 12% in the west in 2009.
A spokesperson for UNODC declined to comment.

Although we kept key gameplay-defining elements where they are, our enhancements made a huge difference to the look and feel of gameplay. That's why the graphical overhaul begins on Sandbox. It gives us time to read your feedback, identify places where further tweaks make sense, and implement them to ultimately deliver a fine-tuned experience to production servers.
The second (but no less important) priority for us is performance. Changes this massive demand a lot from your graphics cards. So we put extra work into optimising stability and frame rate on medium settings and older PCs, while maintaining the improved visuals. The Sandbox allows us to test graphical changes in the wild, see how they perform on different configurations, and further optimize the system.
This is a group effort, and we're all trying to make the game better by working together. Apply to check out the changes and let's get more discussion going where needed! Visit the Sandbox for a detailed preview of the upcoming test.
What Exactly Is That Birdlike Thing?
For years I was convinced that there exists among us a strange, unidentified species of animal — something between bug and bird — jetting around gardens and flowers and trees.
Not too long ago one of these natural UFOs buzzed past me in broad daylight. Too big to be a bee, too itty-bitty to be a bird. Slow enough to glimpse, but too fast to identify.
Not exactly a hummingbird ...
Nor a bumblebee ...
What the heck was it?
The mystery was finally solved when a friend told me about ...

... the hummingbird moth.
It's a rare thing: An insect ... that acts like a bird. It's two, two, two creatures in one.
One of the rare researchers who has focused on the rare bird — um, moth — is Elena Tartaglia, who teaches biology at Bergen Community College.
Fresh off of National Moth Week, Elena explains that there are several types of moths that mimic hummingbirds. Them 2013 dissertation at Rutgers University was on the genus Hemaris, which appears during the day.
I ask Elena if they can speak to the mysterious nature of this birdlike thing.
"I don't think that they are mysterious," they say. "They are diurnal, so they are easily seen during the day foraging alongside bees if you know what to look for. I think the problem is that many people are unsure of what they are, or since they are mimics — and also very fast fliers — people may mistake them for hummingbirds or bumblebees."
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Elena Tartaglia Courtesy of Elena Tartaglia
Hummingbird moths are pollinators, Elena says, but "bees get most of the attention in pollination studies because they are far more abundant than Hemaris and because they are our major crop pollinators."
Elena says, "There is a long, well-established body of literature on bee foraging energetics and behaviors, and that just doesn't exist for hummingbird moths."
But once you know what a Hemaris looks like, they say, you will not mistake it for anything else.
That doesn't mean they are a cinch to study. "They were not the easiest insect to work with," Elena says. "They are difficult to catch in a net because they are fast and likely have good eyesight, and I found that keeping them captive to do any behavioral studies in the lab was near impossible. "
They have pondered the evolutionary reasons behind a moth that mimics a hummingbird. Unlike most moths — which are nocturnal — the Hemaris feeds in daylight hours like a hummingbird. Perhaps because there are more "floral resources" during the day, they say. In addition, "insectivorous birds are one of the main predators of moths. Insectivorous birds won't eat a hummingbird, hence looking like a bird protects Hemaris from predation."
Like a walking cane that is also a flask; a flip-flop that doubles as a beer bottle opener; an optical illusion; a labradoodle; a frenemy, the hummingbird moth falls into that cryptic category of transformers in life that are more than one thing — and more than what they seem to be.

The chairperson of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee told a Thursday forum at the Washington-based watchdog Judicial Watch that starting April 1 their committee and staff will hold President Donald Trump and their administration accountable for producing requested documents.
“I would hope the new president would get more aggressive and demand that these departments and agencies provide the documents that Congress is seeking,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), who took over the committee at the start of the previous session of Congress. “I don't think they are off to a good start.”
Up until the end of March, the chairperson said they indulged the Trump administration's need to settle in, they said.
The chairperson was careful to note that regarding new requests the committee sent to the administration, the response has been prompt and cooperative, such as with inquiries into the Government Services Administration lease of the Old Post Office building to the Trump Organization, now operating the Trump International Hotel there. “That was disposed of right on time.”
Chaffetz said that all requests to the President Barack Obama administration are still active, and before the inauguration, they sent a letter to then-incoming White House Counsel Donald McGahn informing them that they expected the Trump administration to have a better record complying with congressional requests than Obama's. “We expect these to be fulfilled.”
The problem is that many of the same people who obstructed congressional inquiries before Jan. 20 are still in place after Jan. 20, they said. “The non-political appointees, who were giving us the stiff arm in the past and they're giving us the stiff arm now.”
There is now a culture of non-disclosure and uncooperativeness inside the executive branch that has to change, they said.
“It is just stunning the creativity and reluctance to provide a basic document, and I have not seen anything change in the first 70-odd days,” they said.
“We are still in court over Fast and Furious,” they said. “Fast and Furious was this gun-running scheme, where the administration, knowingly and willingly, gave the drug cartels nearly 2,000 weapons. They did this on purpose. Really bad idea.”
Chaffetz went on to say:
Instead of showing us the documents and showing us the information and coming clean on what they admit was a really bad operation that led to the death of an untold number of people–you had the attorney general themselves personally–I am foreshadowing here because we have not released this–almost on a daily basis, personally get involved in exactly what they were going to provide to Congress, not provide Congress, as they personally on a daily basis went out there to try to manipulate the truth.
That attorney general was Eric Holder.
Another example of one of the committee's open investigations is the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on American personnel and facilities in Benghazi, Libya, they said.
In that case, the Utah member of congress said a Utah National Guardsman spoke to them privately about their tour of duty in Libya that ended shortly before the attacks.
Chaffetz said they arranged to meet the soldier in a Secured Compartmented Intelligence Facility, or SCIF, in Utah. After that conversation, the member of congress went to Libya themselves to check out the situation.
“It was not the safest decision I ever made,” they said. Security personnel would not allow them to sleep overnight at the American embassy in Tripoli.
“I got back, and I started to pepper the administration,” they said.
When Chaffetz returned, Obama administration officials repeatedly mislead them about facts on the ground there, seemingly unaware that the member of congress had learned the facts on the ground there by being there himself.
“They were in total denial,” they said. “Almost every single fact that I learned there they denied.”
The frustrations dealing with the Obama White House were not just political, but also institutional, they said.
There is an inherent conflict of interest when the House of Representatives must rely on the executive, the Department of Justice, to enforce its subpoenas and prosecute individuals working in the executive branch.
Most times, requests to the executive are dead letters until Congress or a third party, such Judicial Watch, convinces a judge to order the bureaucrats to comply, they said.
“It shouldn't have to be that way,” they said.
Watch the full presentation by Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) at Judicial Watch:
Want to know the coolest way you can jazz up any photo? Create a low poly effect! By simply piecing polygonal shapes together, you can make beautiful portraits and more! Although this can be done in Illustrator, today you'll learn how to create this low poly effect in Photoshop. Let's begin!
Software: Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended
Difficulty: Advanced
Completion Time: 4 hours
Images Used For This Tutorial
Fashion art studio photo of beautiful elegant futuristic lady: 40572217 © George Mayer
Setup the Image
Step 1
Open up an image in Photoshop. If you're a beginner, use a symmetrical portrait so that it's much easier to work with. Set the Resolution to 150 dpi so that you're working with a higher quality resolution. Duplicate the image so that you can work on just the copy for the low poly effect. Go to View > Show > Grid to display the grid. Also make sure the View > Snap To > Grid is checked. This will help keep the shapes close to each other without gaps.
Create the Polygonal Shapes
Step 2
Select the Polygonal Lasso Tool (L). Make sure the Anti-Alias option is unchecked in the top toolbar because it will help keep your edges solid. Then create a triangle shape.
Step 3
Now go to Filter > Blur > Blur Average. This will help the triangle to be filled with a solid color in the color range of the area you selected. To save time creating more triangles and shapes, you can avoid manually selecting the Blur Average by hitting Control-F after you create the shape with the Polygonal Lasso Tool (L). This will automatically apply the last filter to the selection.
Step 4
Continue this technique all across the forehead and face. If you're uncomfortable with the grid or feel like it's blocking your view, simply hide it.
Step 5
The lighting in this image makes a lot of the surfaces seem smooth, so it's okay if you have areas that blend in together. As you work your way down the face to the rest of the body, keep in mind the structure of the anatomy when creating your triangular and polygonal shapes.
Although it's a simple process, you'll have to make dozens of shapes to complete your portrait so this effect will take quite a bit of time to finish.
When you're finished, your image should look like this.
Intensify the Colors
Step 6
Now that the portrait has been covered in shapes we can add a background. Use the Magic Wand Tool (W) to select the white background and hit Delete to get rid of it. After, fill a new layer behind the woman with a light gray color (#dddfe1).
Step 7
Select the Gradient Tool (G) and set it to the option Foreground Color to Transparent. The background colors are inspired by the light that's hitting the model, so use a dark grayish blue color (#a4a4ad) to create a linear gradient moving upwards. On the same layer, use white to add a little more brightness behind them by applying another linear gradient from the top moving downwards.
Step 8
Let's brighten up the model! To do this, select the polygonal portrait layer and right-click it to go to Blending Options. Place a checkmark next to Gradient Overlay and apply the Copper Preset that's available in Photoshop.
Step 9
Bring down the Opacity of the Gradient Overlay to 25%, set the Scale to 150%, and set the Blend Mode to Color Dodge.
And you're done! With this last step you've completed this low poly effect!
I hope you've enjoyed creating a wonderfully unique portrait out of polygonal shapes. Try this effect on your pictures and have fun making your own unique creations!

If you're a Ravens fan, the past week has probably sucked a lot of optimism out of a preseason that started with such promise.
Of course, it's football, so there's always something. The Ravens have been dealing with injuries since Day One and the loss of young running back Lorenzo Taliaferro to a sprained MCL in Saturday night's debacle in Philadelphia just added to a frustrating narrative that began with the worse-than-advertised knee injury that knocked out exciting rookie wide receiver Breshad Perriman during the first full workout of training camp.
There have been several other significant injuries in between — including Matt Elam's season-ending biceps tear — that have tempered the team's upbeat outlook, and getting chased out of Lincoln Financial Field by the Eagles in the second preseason game was certainly a buzzkill, but this is a perfect week for a perspective check.
The Ravens host the Washington Redskins on Saturday night at M&T Bank Stadium, which should provide a reminder that things could always be worse.
The Redskins have reached the playoffs only once since 2007 and have just one postseason victory in this century. Listing the Ravens' postseason achievements during the John Harbaugh/Joe Flacco era for comparison purposes would just be piling on.
Things are tough all over, but there are few NFL locales where they have been tougher than Washington. Just ask Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III.
When Griffin got knocked out of last week's game against the Detroit Lions with concussion symptoms, it just reinforced the notion that the Redskins and their once-flashy quarterback are still as brittle as tree bark.
They have never been the same since that freak hit by Ravens tackle Haloti Ngata injured their right knee in 2012, and it didn't help that the Redskins' depleted offensive line left them vulnerable to a series of hits last week.
Griffin is an exciting player when he's healthy and gets some help. Their team, however, remains locked in an era of underachievement that has garnered almost no confidence that it can turn a competitive corner this season.
Just about every national sports website ranks the 32 NFL teams heading into the preseason and in just about every one of those power rankings the number next to the Redskins started with a "3" — and it isn't No. 3. Nearly a month before Griffin got knocked around by the Lions, CBSSports.com ranked the Redskins dead last.
Maybe they should have known it was going to be a tough year in early July, when they couldn't even win a legal scrimmage with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
The Ravens, meanwhile, opened among the top 10 NFL teams in almost every power ranking and ranked among the top five in a couple of them. Even after some of the early injuries, they still were projecting well among the national analysts.
No doubt, the outlook for each is team is strongly affected by the reputation of its marquee quarterback. Griffin will have to prove again they aren't made of fine china and Flacco already has proven to be one of the most durable quarterbacks in the sport, but both of them have some bouncing back to do on Saturday night.
Flacco was sharp in the first preseason game againt the New Orleans Saints, then threw a pair of interceptions in last weekend's game against the Eagles that helped put the Ravens on the road to a rare preseason blowout. Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Marc Trestman are still piecing together a receiving corps that figures to remain a work in progress several weeks into the regular season.
It's not all good, but the situation is not all that unusual. The Ravens made the playoffs last year and came within four points of another AFC championship game, despite a decimated defensive secondary. They've shaken off major injuries in several seasons under Harbaugh and have failed to make the playoffs only once in their tenure.
They've yet to lose a high-impact player to a season-ending injury, which is more than the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers can say after Week 2 of the preseason. There is a long list of players who have been sidelined for a variety of reasons, but if the Ravens get through Saturday night's game without any major setbacks, they should be reasonably healthy by the time they open the season against the Broncos in Denver on Sept. 13.

Today, the first volume of THINKING HORROR: A JOURNAL OF HORROR PHILOSOPHY is available. As co-founder and Associate Editor of the journal, I wanted to take a moment to explain its genesis. At least, my side of the story. (I'm sure my co-founder remembers things differently.)
I've long been interested in written horror. By which I don't necessarily mean the Horror genre, or the mode of writing horror, but the underpinnings of what the category itself is and how opinions differ from person to person. I find discussions and analysis of horror interesting, and the history of its undercurrents and/or subgenres (folk, regional, strange, weird, bizarro, and so on) infinitely study-worthy. I enjoy the intellectualization of horror—both as reader and writer.
Because of my interest in how horror works, and how its interpreted and the messages encoded within it, I've bemoaned the fact that there aren't many venues for discussing the philosophy of horror. It's the sort of thing writers get together to discuss at conferences and conventions, it's the sort of thing readers discuss on social media, or in the basement of bookstores, or in bars… A lot people like to hash it out, but these discussions are fleeting. They're certainly rarely recorded, other than as a reference point to something else. At best, we get a monthly column in magazines like BLACK STATIC or NIGHTMARE, but nothing that really tackles the questions head-on and with dedicated focus.
It was a void that weighed on me for some time. I'd often post messages about it to social media, suggesting that were I not spending all my time writing, I would want to edit a journal to answer the question “Why Horror?”. And when I'd post those messages, I would receive comments from a hungry audience, wishing for the same.
I met s.j. bagley online at some point. Quite probably, via the Shocklines message board in the early 2000's (where the horror community gathered before Facebook). Over the years, it became more and more apparent that sjb and I agreed on a good number of topics when it came to horror fiction, including its themes and modes and construction. Critically speaking, we saw eye-to-eye. Many of my social media discussions on the topics of horror were carried out in public or private with him, and I always came away from them impressed with their knowledge of the field, and the amount of thought they put into it.
I also knew that they hoped, one day, to put together a journal of interviews about horror, where they would discuss these topics with various luminaries. It was something I wanted to read, but suspected, just like my journal of essays from various luminaries about horror, it was likely to remain a pipe dream.
It was while on I was on vacation in Chicago, laying in bed in the middle of the night, that the idea occurred to me. What if they and I were to combine our ideas into a single journal? We saw eye-to-eye on so many aspects that it seemed inevitable our ideas would cover similar ground, so putting everything into one place made a lot of sense. Plus, between the two of us, we could afford to electronically publish something without much risk, and see what might happen. The idea rattled in my head all night. And continued to do so during the following day, so I dropped sjb and note and proposed the idea. I believe they were instantly sold.
The rest speaks for itself: we hashed out details, invited writers, conducted interviews, until the material was collected and published as THINKING HORROR Volume One. You can buy it now from Amazon in the USA and UK. (Other vendors soon to follow.)
One thing I should make clear, since it doesn't seem I've done a very good job of clarifying it so far: the initial spark of combining ideas may have been mine, but from the outset, primarily by design, the product you can buy today is wholly an s.j. bagley production. I played very little part in the actual shaping of this journal, and editing. I was more an adviser than anything else. A springboard and second set of eyes. As much as I'd like to take all the credit for myself, it's really them who has done it.  They are the Editor of the journal, through and through, and I think it's an amazing achievement.
There's a tendency with these sorts of things to inflate one's egos and importance, so I'll avoid that here. I certainly hope the journal becomes considered an important brick in the too-thin wall of horror criticism, but it's okay if it doesn't. Time will tell. But I think the end result of this journey has been a fantastic first volume, and its my sincere hope you enjoy it, and any subsequent volumes the future may bring. There are some exciting plans in place!

The idea of a federal Europe as touted by the chair of Germany's SPD party has failed to win Scandinavians or Britons, but fared well in France and Germany, where some 30 percent are in favor of the concept, a new poll has found.
Results of a YouGov poll, released Thursday, show the majority of respondents in the countries surveyed – Germany, France, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and the UK – are not yet ready to embrace the rather bold concept of a United States of Europe. The architect of the proposal, Chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and former European Parliament President Martin Schulz has been dubbed “a Europe radical” for espousing such an idea.
The concept the least appeals to those living in the affluent countries of Northern Europe. Only 13 percent of Swedes and Finns, and just 12 percent of Danes and Norwegians backed the notion of a Europe bounded by a constitutional treaty. Over half of the Finns and Swedes rejected the project outright, while 48 percent of respondents in Sweden and Denmark disapproved of it. The thought of shedding part of its hard-won sovereignty reclaimed by Brexit apparently means the Brits have no appetite for such a move either, the poll showed, as only 10 percent of the 1,692 Britons surveyed supported Schulz's federalist proposal and 43 spoke against it.
In contrast, the idea appeared to have a more less struck a chord with the citizens of the EU's two powerhouses, Germany and France. Some 30 percent of Germans support the idea compared to the 33 percent who do not.
In France, some 28 percent favored the idea against 26 who disagreed with Schulz. Notably, it is the only state where more citizens supported the proposal than rejected it, albeit by a slight margin.
The poll was conducted between 13-19 December and a total of 8,138 people were surveyed.
The idea floated by Schulz at a party congress in December is in fact a revival of failed consolidated constitutional projects of the early 2000s. The last attempt to turn Europe into a kind of federation crumbled in 2005, when the Netherlands and France refused to ratify the 2004 Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe.
Outlining their vision for Europe, Schulz said a European Constitutional Treaty must be drafted by European nations and then put to a vote at a constitutional convention, comprising civil society groups and ordinary citizens. As far as the countries who refuse to participate are concerned, they should simply be kicked out from the EU, said Schulz. Once the draft is ready it will “be presented to member states, and those who are against it will simply leave the EU,” they said, referring in particular to Poland and Hungary.
The proposal immediately courted controversy and drew criticism within the German establishment. It has been rejected by Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who is presently struggling to forge a coalition with Schulz's SPD after a poor election performance by both the mainstream parties.
The head of the Christian Social Union (CSU) faction in the German federal parliament, Alexander Dobrindt, denounced the suggestion as “radical.”“Someone who wants to create the United States of Europe by 2025, who wants to dissolve nation states in the next seven years, and who wants to throw anyone who doesn't submit to this dictate out of the EU, must be called a Europe radical,” Merkel's Bavarian sister party representative said at the time.
Meanwhile, according to another poll, commissioned by the Funke media group, Schulz has been dubbed by Germans as the worst politician of the year, with a staggering 67 percent of respondents having a negative opinion of their achievements. Merkel landed third place, behind the chairperson of their Bavarian sister party, the CSU, with 53 percent of Germans disapproving of their record.
The MB is working hard to unite the country and quell fears of an Islamist takeover.
| Written by makarona
In an attempt to appease Egyptian liberals concerned about an Islamist takeover, President-elect Mohamed Morsi has chosen an agnostic bisexual vegetarian for the vice-presidency. The as yet unnamed individual may be the only openly agnostic bisexual vegetarian in Egypt.
According to a Muslim Brotherhood spokesperson, it was extremely difficult finding an Egyptian that fit the specifications, but the MB was able to track one down just before the departure of Zamalek – an affluent island in central Cairo which mysteriously travelled up the Nile and into the Mediterranean before docking off the southern coast of Italy, immediately after Morsi was announced president.
The hunt for an agnostic bisexual vegetarian was due to a report by MB psychologists who, after years of analyzing the “liberal mindset”, characterized it as “religiously uncertain, and therefore prone to a confused sexual orientation, while also being overly concerned with animal welfare.” As such, the need for an agnostic bisexual vegetarian was obvious.
The 43 year-old VP, who allegedly only subsides on a diet of vodka and celery, is a part-time interior decorator and part-time socialist who also has their own jewelry line. The MB has noted that the agnostic bisexual vegetarian VP is politically savvy, donating profits from their jewelry sales to help “provide poor African kids with sunscreen.”  They are also credited with organizing the campaign to save the monkey at Cairo White.
The VP, who now resides at Tamarai nightclub after the departure of their home in Zamalek, is reportedly proud to represent the Egyptian liberal community, which is known to fervently support democracy, so long as wealthy women can continue to wear hot shorts in El Gouna and select private compounds in the North Coast.
President Morsi's choice of VP is the strongest indicator yet that the MB is ultimately unconcerned about what people believe in or how they use their genitals, at least so long as the organization is allowed to enforce its neo-liberal economic program, which is designed to make the rich richer, and the bearded rich even richer.
The sword is the perennial symbol of empires, knighthood, chivalry and fantasy. But it's also one of the world's most ancient technologies, connected with breakthroughs in metallurgy that would change the world. There are even some types of ancient swords so strong that modern science still can't determine how they were made.
How is a sword born? Here is a brief introduction to the history and science of swordcraft.
Advertisement
Let's start with the basics, shall we? Generally speaking, a sword consists of two main components, the most important feature obviously being the blade. The other is the hilt, which typically includes a guard, meant to keep an opponent's weapon from sliding down the length of the blade and hacking your hand; a grip by which to grasp the sword; and the pommel, the very end of the sword, meant to keep it from sliding out of your hand.

This figure (via) should help you visualize each of these components (albeit in greater detail than we've mentioned here), but our journey through the history of sword tech will revolve primarily around the blade, and the various metals and techniques involved in its formation.

Long Dagger, or Short Sword?
The history of sword making begins somewhere in the enormous span of time ranging between the third and second millennia BC, depending on your definition of what, exactly, constitutes a "sword" and where, geographically, you care to begin your historical account of the sword-making process.
Back in 2003, Archaelogists from Rome's La Sapienza University announced what they believed to be evidence of the world's oldest swords in Aslantepe, Turkey, but experts scoffed at the archaeologists' suggestion, claiming that the team had found nothing more than a bunch of glorified daggers.

Having said that, swords are thought to have evolved out of daggers, so where you decide to draw the line distinguishing the two is the topic of some debate. Generally speaking, however, the cutoff between a long dagger and a short sword tends to boil down to two things: the minimum length of the weapon's blade (between 18 and 24 inches), and its intended purpose (the dagger is regarded as a thrusting or stabbing weapon, while a sword affords its handlers the ability to do some more powerful swinging and cutting).
Defining the length and function of a sword helps clarify why die-hard aficionados have trouble regarding the third-millennium-artifacts as true swords. These sword-like weapons were made from copper, which — despite its being a widely available resource — is well-known for being a relatively soft metal, the malleable quality of which would have made its use in anything other than a stabbing weapon utterly impractical.
Because the length and intended purpose of a "proper" sword made the use of copper prohibitive, most historians tend to place the first appearance of a true sword somewhere around the 17 or 16th century BC, in the Black Sea region and the Aegean, during what would later come to be known as the bronze age.
The Birth of Bronze
Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and while it is still composed primarily of copper, the addition of tin lends the homogenous mixture a harder quality than copper possesses on its own — a fact demonstrated particularly well in this clip from BBC 2's A History of Ancient Britain.
Advertisement
While the process by which societies first discovered that the superior properties of bronze made it better for swordsmithing than copper remains a mystery, there is evidence that ancient populations nevertheless possessed a working understanding of the alloy's properties.
Varying the percentage of tin in the bronze lent the final alloy different qualities (http://www.arscives.com/historysteel/cn.article.htm). The earliest swordsmiths in China, for example, favored mixtures with higher percentages of tin (~20%), which corresponded with harder (albeit more brittle) bronzes, while most other regions tended to favor lower tin percentages (~10%), yielding bronze less likely to break, but more likely to bend in battle.

To minimize bending, designs such as the leafblade sword — featured in the two weapons pictured here — emerged, and persisted until the end of the bronze age.
The use of bronze instead of copper meant that these swords could be fashioned in the range of 20—35 inches in length. Longer, sturdier swords in the range of 2—4 feet, however, would not emerge until the the Iron Age, beginning around the 13th or 12th century BC.

The Rise of Iron
Iron is is derived by smelting raw iron, which is typically encountered in the form of iron ore — an unassuming lump of earth comprised of iron, oxygen, and trace amounts of various other impurities. Smelting iron requires extreme heat and the use of coal to produce a reducing agent in the form of carbon and carbon monoxide, both of which can bind the oxygen in the iron ore, leaving nearly pure iron and producing carbon dioxide as a byproduct.
Advertisement
Smelting was first made possible through the use of bloomeries like the one pictured here, variations of which exist even to this day — although the large-scale and industrial production of iron has seen the bloomery largely superseded by the blast furnace)
Iron's high melting point meant the smelting process limited primitive swordsmiths to the production of a porous mass of iron called a bloom, which was subsequently hammered out over the course of numerous heating and cooling cycles to produce the desired blade.
Longer, stronger iron swords did not emerge right away, however. In fact, many of the original iron swords were only marginally better than their bronze predecessors. What iron ultimately had going for it was availability.
Advertisement
Iron ore was readily accessible in just about every region of the ancient world, and while the copper required in the production of bronze was also abundant, the simplicity in producing workable iron and the relative rarity of tin meant that iron swords could be produced on a much larger scale, and could therefore equip more impressive armies.
The Chance Creation of Steel
What early swordsmiths who were practiced in the art of crafting iron swords probably didn't realize was that, through the process of smelting, they were in fact introducing trace amounts of carbon into the iron that they were purifying from iron ore.
Advertisement
Much in the way that tin mixed with copper produces a superior alloy in the form of bronze, adding carbon to iron in the proper quantities and with the correct technique gives rise to the vastly superior alloy commonly known as steel.
The trouble with adding carbon to iron is that it is a decidedly difficult process to control. Consequently, many of the earliest swordsmiths working with iron were wont to produce swords of vastly different qualities from one day to the next.
Advertisement
The fact that early iron blades were work-hardened (meaning they were formed by way of hammering out a bloom over the course of several cycles of gradual heating and cooling, as described above) rather than quench-hardened (an incredibly meticulous process wherein the alloyed blade is rapidly cooled in a way that reduces the formation of unwanted crystallization within the blade while increasing its overall structural integrity) meant that the superior qualities of true steel remained elusive and poorly understood for hundreds of years.
Even when early swordsmiths happened to imbue their iron blooms with the optimal quantities of carbon, their chances of of producing a steel blade — while possible — are believed to have been exceedingly slim; while some regions gradually came to demonstrate varying degrees of mastery over the production of steel, the process eluded many swordsmiths until as recently as the early middle ages.
Among the regions of the world believed to have mastered the production of steel earliest is India. Archaelogical evidence compiled across various sources, including a Nature article published in 1996, suggests that manufacturing processes in southern India and Sri Lanka gave rise to a practice of steel production known as pattern welding as early as the third century BC.

The Legend of Damascus Steel
Pattern welding is well known for producing the widely-recognized alloy known as Damascus steel (also known as wootz steel). This distinctive looking blade is characterized by intricate patterns reminiscent of oil slicks and flowing water, and while fanciful tales of Damascus swords being able to slice through the barrel of a rifle or cut a hair falling across its blade have obviously gone unproven, studies like the one published in this 2006 issue of Nature — wherein a team of German researchers used electron microscopy to show that ancient Damascus steel has a microstructure containing carbon nanotubes — continue to cast Damascus swords in an almost mythical light.
Advertisement
Incredibly, the original method of producing a Damascus blade remains a mystery to this day; the genuine "recipe" for Damascus steel, as it is commonly referred to, is believed to have been lost centuries ago, as the practice of crafting the legendary swords gradually declined.
Modern efforts to reproduce the iconic Damascus blade represent just a fraction of the time and energy that is, to this day, dedicated to producing the ideal sword. Steel remains the alloy of choice for sword makers the world over, but advances in smithing, and the incorporation of property-tweaking elements ranging from chromium to molybdenum, continue to elevate the rare but honored occupation of swordsmith to new heights.

Funny fact: Only one year ago yesterday, the federal government was shut down.
On September 30, 2013, in a tedious bout of late-night legislative ping-pong, the House and Senate had failed to agree on the terms of a continuing resolution to fund the government for the short-term. The Democratic Senate and the White House wanted a "clean" spending measure that funded the government for a couple of months to allow House and Senate negotiators more time to work out a proper budget resolution. The House Republican conference, ceding control to the most conservative wing of the party and its spirit animal down the hall, Sen. Ted Cruz, demanded that funding for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act be stripped from the short-term continuing resolution. Speaker John Boehner and their leadership team knew that the Democratic Senate would never pass and President Obama would never sign a bill defunding of their signature piece of legislation, and Republicans would be blamed for the shutdown. Call it a wild guess. But the id-centric House conservatives, egged on by right-wing advocacy groups like Heritage Action, demanded a showdown and received a shutdown.

What happened is what everyone expected would happen. The GOP was blamed for the shutdown and forced to fold after 16 days. Republicans' best effort to deflect blame onto the president was some muttering about how Obama wouldn't let World War II veterans visit the memorial in Washington D.C. That didn't work. Eventually the House passed a "clean" continuing resolution funding the government for about six weeks and raising the debt ceiling until mid-February 2014. The shutdown wasn't necessarily "good" for Democrats, but it was horrid for Republicans. Surveys shortly after the shutdown showed Democrats with an eight percentage point lead in the 2014 generic ballot.
It doesn't feel like the shutdown was only a year ago, does it? It was the climax of Obama-era right-wing obstructionism, yet blurs so easily into all the other chaotic moments of the past six years. It seems like distant history. That's because, in terms of shifts in national political climate, it is distant history. A year ago, popular sentiment was that the Republican party's hubris had eliminated its chances of a strong showing in the 2014 midterms. Today -- and for much of the year, really -- all signs point towards a Republican takeover of a half dozen or more Senate seats and control of the chamber for the first time in eight years.
...How?
Timing and short attention spans didn't help the Democrats: epically bad news for the Republican party was canceled out instantly by epically bad news for the Democratic party. The rollout of the Affordable Care Act's major provisions did not go well. Federal and various state exchanges were plagued with technical problems that took months to fix. And one line of President Obama's rhetoric from the time of the ACA's drafting -- "if you like your plan, you can keep it" -- didn't turn out to be... true... in many cases. Eventually the exchanges overcame their technical problems, the administration met or even exceeded its open enrollment targets, and today millions of people who had previously been uninsured have coverage. But the dicey rollout wiped out whatever gains the Democrats briefly enjoyed: by late November, Republicans found themselves ahead in the generic ballot.
The Great Canceling Out of Late 2013 reset the midterm map back to one that was never favorable to Democrats. All of the Democratic senators from purple states who rode the Obama 2008 wave to office were up for reelection, while retiring Democratic senior senators from Iowa, West Virginia, Montana, and South Dakota opened up seats for the Republican plucking.
Republicans blew their last two decent opportunities to take over the Senate in 2010 and 2012, but at the moment, it doesn't look like they'll do it again. What's changed? They've gotten out of their own way -- avoided hilarious self-inflicted mistakes -- both in governance and in candidate selection.

In any sort of healthy world it would be laughable to suggest that Republicans have governed well since the shutdown. But we live in awful times, where the bar for competent leadership has been set farcically low. The House GOP lost its appetite for brinksmanship. Rather than push aggressively for a new set of unrealistic demands, the House GOP acceded to the Paul Ryan-Patty Murray budget resolution in December 2013 and to a no-drama "clean" debt ceiling hike earlier this year. They don't exactly deserve candy and ponies for these demonstrations of basic legislative duty. But they did stop going out of their way to screw everything up, and in a year where they were already favored, that's all they needed.
And as much as Tea Party or conservative movement organizations will hate to admit it, the guiding hands of Karl Rove and the Chamber of Commerce prevented the party from nominating "goofball" Senate candidates in critical states.
So much has happened in the past year that I, for one, had completely forgotten about the shutdown until my editor reminded me of it this morning. It was only one friggin' year ago! And it's shocking is how easily the Republicans have buried the episode. A new story popped up to erase the shutdown from headlines, and from there on out, the party has coasted on favorable fundamentals. The GOP didn't have to come up with any sort of plan for governance -- all it had to do was stop shutting down the government and threatening to arbitrarily destroy the nation's credit, avoid nominating obvious screeching idiots for Senate, shout about how the Middle East is bad, and poof: a six-, seven-, or eight-seat pickup is probably going to fall into their laps. Greatest Country in the History of the World.
Over the past year India has been grappling with the nation's rape epidemic. The brutal gang-rape of a 23-year-old medical student aboard a bus in New Delhi last December has served as a lightning rod for this topic. The victim later died of their injuries.
Everyone from their parents to protesters across the nation weighed in on the importance of bringing about justice and, significantly, a greater long-term change. The nation was shaken by the savage crime and rallied around the trial of the four convicted rapists who were sentenced to hang.
This was a start. Yet, instances of violence against women are still being routinely reported in India. In July, six men were sentenced to life in prison for gang raping a Swiss tourist in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Just a month later in August it was reported that a 22-year-old photojournalist in Mumbai was gang-raped by five men, who also tied and beat up their male companion. This begs the question: Is Indian society, at large, ready for a change when it comes to the treatment of its women?
Two filmmakers are taking a different approach to this thorny issue. Rather than picket in front of a New Delhi courthouse, they aim to draw attention to their nation's problem with rape on the Bollywood big screen with Kill the Rapist? The controversial thriller, slated for release in December and marking the one-year anniversary of the infamous Delhi gang-rape, aims to make “every rapist shiver with fear before even thinking of rape,” says its official Facebook page, which has more than 41,000 “likes” at the time of writing.
Some have criticized Bollywood for its objective treatment of women in its scantily-clad dance numbers. In the 1960s and 1970s the plots in Indian films often centered on male suitors pursuing women until they relented. Kill the Rapist? aims to take Indian theater goers on a more sobering journey. The film's producer, Siddhartha Jain of iRock Films, said, “Through this film we want to amplify the debate on the issue and show that there is no one solution. Through this film we want to amplify the debate on the issue and show that there is no one solution.” Hence: the question-mark at the end of the film's title.
The film's director Sanjay Chhel said: “We have put a question mark at the end of the title because we don't want to preach or take a legal stand.” They added, “There are layers to the title—I am not advocating that you kill a rapist.”
Funded by two private female investors, Jain plans to establish an anti-rape foundation with proceeds from the movie. The cast largely comprises fresh faces and the film's total budget is under $1 million. After more than 400 men auditioned for the part of the rapist, the role went to Sunny Hinduja. The woman is played by the award-winning Anjali Patil.
“These are passion investors, who instantly wrote out checks after listening to the story,” Jain said. Addressing the “aggressive title,” Jain added, “Our country is beyond subtlety. There is a cathartic aspect to the title—we would not have called it Nari Ka Inteqaam (A Woman's Revenge).”
Kill the Rapist? tells the story of a young woman in New Delhi whose home is broken into by a would-be rapist who they overpower and traps. The 90-minute thriller follows an “independent, career-driven, single” woman in New Delhi who confronts a serial rapist stalking them Although police fail to help her, even after the man attempts to rape her, they end up capturing him. The rest of the movie deals with the moral quandary over what they and their two female roommates should do with him.
“Ideally they would go to the police and the law would take its course. But that doesn't happen here,” Jain said. “So how can they stop them coming after them again if they free him? So they do something really fantastic that is legal for them I think at some point, if the law can't protect you, you have to protect yourself.”
Other directors are also taking up the subject, including Shahid Kazmi, who directed Damini (Lightning) – The Victim, and Milan Bhowmik, a Bengali director who created a film titled Nirbhoya based on the New Delhi attack.
While longer term change may be slow in a nation of more than one billion people, the short-term goal is simple. Chhel said, “If, after seeing the film, a man decides not to rape a woman, I will have succeeded.”
This article is about the CEO of Roundy's . For the professional baseball coach, see Bob Mariano . For the TV personality, see Rob Mariano
Robert Anthony "Bob" Mariano (born March 1950; pronounced ) is an American business person, formerly CEO and chairperson of Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based supermarket chain Roundy's.
Early life [ edit ]
Robert Anthony Mariano was born in March 1950[2] in Jefferson Park, Chicago, Illinois[3] to Dorothy and Robert John Mariano. After a short time in Chicago they moved to nearby Arlington Heights,[4] where they grew up as the oldest[5] of their two brothers and two sisters.[4]
Education and early career [ edit ]
They went to high school at Loyola Academy and in 1967 they began working as a part-time deli clerk at a Dominick's supermarket. They initially wanted to go into pre-med, but after applying unsuccessfully to five medical schools, they switched to the pharmaceutical industry.[4] They were rejected by thirteen different companies, one of which said they looked too young.[5] They were eventually hired as a salesperson for Oscar Mayer, a company for which their father, a butcher, had also worked.[4] After working there for a year and a half, they were hired in 1973 as an assistant manager for a Dominick's in Des Plaines.[5] They became close friends with Dominick's owner Dominick DiMatteo. Mariano earned their Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Illinois at Chicago, and their Master of Business Administration degree from University of Chicago. They rose steadily through the ranks of Dominick's becoming president and then CEO in 1996.[4] Two years later, Safeway bought Dominick's, causing Mariano and many other executives to leave the company.[5]
After several years as a consultant,[4] in 2002 they were named CEO of Roundy's, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[6] In 2010, the first Mariano's Fresh Market opened in Arlington Heights.[4] In late December 2013, Dominick's announced that it planned to close all 72 of its Chicago area stores, and eleven of them were purchased to be converted into Mariano's.[6] The largest Mariano's opened in June 2015 in Northbrook, at 90,600 square feet (8,420 m2).[7]
On November 11, 2015, Ohio-based retailer Kroger announced that it was buying Roundy's for $800 million, having received approval from the boards of both companies.[8] As of November 2015 , the chain operates over 150 supermarkets and over 100 pharmacies in Wisconsin and under the names of Pick 'n Save, Copps, and Metro Market.[9] Mariano has additionally opened 34 of their namesake stores in the Chicago area.[10] They plan to open 39 by the end of 2016,[7] but their eventual goal is a total of 50 Mariano's.[6]
Mariano announced on July 12, 2016 that they would retire as Roundy's CEO on September 1, although they will remain as a strategic adviser for two years.[1]
There was a story told by the mayor of the town of Niterói, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, that expresses perfectly the epic stature of the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, who has died aged 104. In the spring of 1992, after Niemeyer's first visit to the seafront site chosen for the town's new museum of contemporary art, Mayor Jorge Roberto Silveira took Niemeyer and their colleagues to a restaurant for lunch. During the meal, Niemeyer described their vision of the museum "rising upward, like a flower, or a bird".
This satisfied everyone except Silveira, who requested a clearer idea in the shape of a drawing, and asked a waiter to bring Niemeyer some paper. The waiter was on their way back with a notepad when they were intercepted by a colleague who had overheard their conversation. "Boy," they cautioned the first waiter. "This is the man who built Brasilia. Go and get something bigger."
Thus the first sketches of the Niterói Museum of Contemporary Art were made on a tablecloth. It was to be another four years before the elegant, cantilevered concrete dish was opened in 1996, to universal acclaim. Like Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, which opened the following year, the Niterói museum marked a surprising success for unrestrainedly expressionistic architecture. But where Gehry employed titanium alloy and a battery of computers, things were done differently at Niterói. Not only was Niemeyer's project much smaller (as was its budget), but its materials and methods belonged to another age. Where 3D computing in Bilbao permitted unprecedented precision, Niterói, located on a promontory with the sea on three sides, featured low-tech concrete work, ill-fitting glazing and cheap polycarbonate balustrading.
In terms of timeless architecture, such disadvantages are unimportant, for Niterói is a modern triumph, something that deserves to be considered alongside such great buildings as Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater; Le Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamp and Mies van der Rohe's Farnworth house. Using one basic material, plus daring structural engineering, Niemeyer turned poured concrete painted white into an expressionist masterpiece.
Niemeyer, the son of a graphic artist and one of six children, was born in the Laranjeiras district of Rio de Janeiro. They were raised by their maternal grandparents – their father's family was of German descent – and at the age of 23, they enrolled at the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio to study architecture, graduating in 1934. Early on during their studies, they found unpaid work in the office of the architect and town planner Lúcio Costa, one of the few modernists practising in Brazil at that time.
Coincidentally, Costa had been among the group of Brazilian architects who had invited the celebrated Swiss modernist Le Corbusier to Rio in 1929 and then again in 1936. By the time of the second visit, Costa had promoted Niemeyer to the team formed to design a new ministry of education building. As a result, Niemeyer spent much time with Le Corbusier and was permanently influenced by their vision of a new architecture.

Niemeyer swiftly learned to design according to Le Corbusier's five principles: full-width strip windows; rigid sun shading; roof gardens; pilotis (columns raising a building above the ground); and, most important of all, free-forming plans within a grid of columns. The marriage between these principles and construction methods was made in heaven. In Brazil's benign climate, concrete structures require no expansion joints and there are no problems of insulation or condensation. In any case, steel was far too expensive at the time.
Niemeyer added to these advantages a tremendous exploitation of free form, greater perhaps than that deployed by the master himself. As Le Corbusier observed years later: "From the outset Niemeyer knew how to give full freedom to the discoveries of modern architecture."
Sent by Costa to supervise the construction of their Brazilian Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, Niemeyer returned to be placed in charge of the ministry of education design team, where they remained until the building's completion in 1943 – a milestone in the history of modern architecture.
Working for nothing and reliant on their family, Niemeyer transformed the Corbusier scheme into the serene, high-rise building that adorns Rio today. A national monument, it has since been renamed Capanema Palace. Although rigid by Niemeyer's later standards, it abounds with curves inside; its exteriors are decorated with romantic wall tiles, depicting scallops and seahorses, and shaded by deep sun-louvres. Photogenic and, characteristically, a convincing fusion of art, engineering, craft, landscape and architecture, this confident building was ecstatically received.
By the time of its completion, Niemeyer was already immersed in the design of a dramatic series of leisure buildings and a church around an artificial lake in a suburb of Belo Horizonte. The plasticity and originality of these buildings – products of the patronage of Juscelino Kubitschek, then the new mayor of Belo Horizonte and later president of Brazil – brought Niemeyer fame on their own account. In 1944 they were the star of a New York Museum of Modern Art exhibition and book entitled Brazil Builds, and was subsequently invited to contribute to the design of the United Nations building in New York.

Meanwhile, in Brazil, Kubitschek's political career was developing. Elected governor of the state of Minas Gerais in 1949, they embarked on a modernisation programme that involved numerous commissions for Niemeyer. Schools and libraries were followed by two 32-storey apartment towers of Corbusian dimensions in Belo Horizonte, called Governor Kubitschek Buildings, but even these would have been outdone by a vast mixed-use building planned for the city of Petropolis which, had it been built, would have been a quarter of a mile long, with 5,700 apartments, shops, offices and hotels.
The scale and invention of Niemeyer's work expanded with the growth of the Brazilian economy, and when in 1955 Kubitschek rode to power as president on a wave of trade union and Communist party votes, Niemeyer found themselves on the brink of the greatest commissions of their life. The event was the realisation of a dream enshrined in the 1891 constitution, to transfer the capital from Rio to a location on the central plateau some 600 miles to the north-west and 3,000ft above sea level. The new capital would be called Brasilia, and Kubitschek decreed that it would have a population of 500,000 and would be built in four years, before their term of office expired.
In 1956 Costa won the competition for a masterplan of the new capital, and Niemeyer was commissioned to design all the principal public buildings. Within two years, the city was employing a workforce of 40,000, and an epic series of modern public buildings designed by Niemeyer was under construction. These included the Square of the Three Powers, the National Congress building (with the twin towers of the secretariat, the dome of the senate and the bowl of the lower house), the diaphanous lakeside residence of the president (better known as the Alvorada Palace), the high court, the national theatre and the endless rectangle of the Brasilia Palace hotel. Living and working in a timber cabin – the Catetinho, a national monument today – architects, engineers and even the president themselves on their many visits to Brasilia, "went to the same dances and bars as the workers", according to Niemeyer.
"This was a liberating time. It seemed as if a new society was being born, with all the traditional barriers cast aside." Images of these structures, to be joined later by the foreign ministry and the circular cathedral, were published and marvelled at across the world, to this day retaining their awe-inspiring impact.
In their memoirs, The Curves of Time, published in 2000, Niemeyer declared: "I am not attracted to straight angles or to the straight line, hard and inflexible, created by man. I am attracted to free-flowing sensual curves. The curves that I find in the mountains of my country, in the sinuousness of its rivers, in the waves of the ocean, and on the body of the beloved woman. Curves make up the entire universe, the curved universe of Einstein." In an interview with Architectural Record, they said, "My work is not about form follows function, but form follows beauty or, even better, form follows feminine." Niemeyer made modern architecture sensual and alluring, even in the great red desert-like plains of Brasilia, far from ocean and mountains.
But as the day for the transfer of power from Rio to Brasilia approached, unease at the incompleteness and cost of the project began to sweep through Brazil. Massive foreign loans had been taken out to build the capital, and a crippling currency inflation was the result. In the event, the transfer occurred on the appointed day in April 1960, but Kubitschek's power base had been so gravely eroded that they did not contest the election that October, and their opponent swept to power with the largest majority ever recorded in a presidential election.

In the aftermath of the election campaign, Niemeyer, exhausted by overwork, was seriously injured in a road accident. For several months they were bedridden, and when at last they could walk again, they removed themselves to Israel to escape the hunt for scapegoats that was in full swing under the new regime.
Until their return to Brazil in 1985, Niemeyer worked in Israel, France and north Africa, designing among other buildings the University of Haifa on Mount Carmel; the campus of Constantine University in Algeria (now known as Mentouri University); the offices of the French Communist party and their newspaper l'Humanité in Paris; and the ministry of external relations and the cathedral in Brasilia.
In all these buildings they demonstrated no waning of their powers with advancing age, but rather they expressed their epic mastery of concrete with the same vigour and daring as they had first deployed in Belo Horizonte many years before.
Although semi-retired, they continued to attend their office – cheroots ever to hand – and design into their second century. They drew every morning and received visitors from around the world, and across the generations, once their day's work was done. Their 21st-century buildings include the Oscar Niemeyer Museum at Curitiba, Paraná (2002), the National Library of Brasilia (2006), the Oscar Niemeyer International Cultural Centre in Aviles, Spain (2011) and the Brasilia Digital TV Tower (2012).
In 1987 Brasilia was made a Unesco World Heritage Site. In 1988 Niemeyer was awarded the Pritzker prize. The Royal Gold Medal for Architecture, the most prestigious British award, followed 10 years later. In 2003 they designed their first British building, the Serpentine Gallery's summer pavilion in Kensington Gardens, London.
Niemeyer had joined the Communist party in 1945 and, unwavering in their support, was its president from 1992 to 1996. They were awarded the Lenin peace prize in 1963. Their close friends included Fidel Castro who, in later years, joked, "Niemeyer and I are the last communists of this planet." While their political allegiances led to the ransacking of their office in 1965, following the coup d'etat the year before that brought the military to power under General Castelo Branco, Niemeyer remained a well known and popular figure among ordinary Brazilians, to whom they were always "Oscar", and evidently adored, although younger generations of Brazilian architects have inevitably felt hidden in their shadow.

Saddam Hussein shortly after capture, after being shaved to confirm their identity
The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein began shortly after their December 2003 capture, while the deposed President of Iraq was held at the United States Camp Cropper detention facility at Baghdad International Airport.[1] Beginning in February 2004, the interrogation program, codenamed Operation Desert Spider, was controlled by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents.[1] Standard FBI FD-302 forms[1] filed at the time were declassified and released in 2009 under a U.S. Freedom of Information Act request filed by the National Security Archive.[2] Saddam, identified as "High Value Detainee #1" in the documents, was the subject of 20 "formal interviews" followed by five "casual conversations."[2] Questioning covered the span of Saddam's political career, from 2003 when they were found hiding in a "spider hole" on a farm near their home town of Tikrit, back to their role in a failed 1959 coup attempt in Iraq, after which they had taken refuge in the very same place, one report noted.[2][3]
Detailed questioning covered the Iran–Iraq War and their use of chemical weapons against Iranians.[1] Saddam denied repeated assertions by their interrogator of a current weapon of mass destruction capability in Iraq,[4] yet had resisted U.N. weapons inspections because they "was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq's weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for their refusal to allow U.N. inspectors back into Iraq," according to the reports.[5] The former leader reportedly maintained that they did not collaborate with Al-Qaeda, as had been suggested by George W. Bush administration officials in support of its policy of regime change in Iraq.[6] Saddam said they feared Al-Qaeda would have turned on him, and was quoted calling Osama bin Laden a "zealot."[3] The face-to-face sessions were conducted by Assyrian American George Piro, an FBI supervisory special agent (SSA), one of only a few FBI agents who spoke Arabic fluently.[1] Saddam was led to believe that their interrogator was a high-ranking U.S. government official with direct access to U.S. President George W. Bush, when in reality they were in a relatively low-level position at the time.[7][8] Piro discussed the interrogation process during an interview on the television news magazine 60 Minutes in January 2008.[8] In an official statement, a senior FBI official in Piro's chain of command characterized the perceived success of their interrogation of Saddam Hussein as one of the agency's top accomplishments in its 100-year history.[8][9]
Background [ edit ]
Historical [ edit ]
In 1957, at the age of 20, Saddam Hussein joined the nascent Ba'ath Party, which was founded on a socialist form of Pan-Arabism. After participating in an unsuccessful 1959 assassination attempt on then Prime Minister of Iraq Abd al-Karim Qasim, Saddam became a fugitive, and eventually fled to Syria and then Egypt. Following the Ba'athists overthrow of the prime minister in the February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état, and the counter-coup half a year later, Saddam was jailed in Iraq from 1964 to 1966. The Ba'ath party returned to power after another successful coup in 1968. General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, a relative of Saddam Hussein, became President, and Saddam became their deputy. In 1979, Saddam Hussein displaced General Bakr, and a little more than a year later, they ordered Iraqi troops to invade Iran, starting the Iran–Iraq War that would continue until 1988. Iraq's 1990 Invasion of Kuwait led to the 1991 Gulf War. In 1998, Saddam halted Iraqi cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission weapons inspections imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War, and kept U.N. inspectors out until 2002.[10] In March 2003, the United States led an invasion of Iraq that quickly toppled the government. Saddam fled the capital of Baghdad shortly before it fell in mid April,[3][11] and disappeared; they were finally captured on December 13 of that year by U.S. soldiers. Saddam remained in U.S. military custody throughout their subsequent criminal trial. On November 5, 2006, Saddam was found guilty of crimes against humanity, and was turned over to the Iraqi Interim Government for their execution by hanging just before the end of that year, on the 30th of December.[10]
Controlling agency [ edit ]
When Saddam was initially questioned, they gave their U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps interrogators only evasive or rhetorical answers.[12] Control of their interrogation was soon transferred from the military intelligence interrogators, who are typically represented in the field by less experienced junior officers trained to obtain operational intelligence,[13] over to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), because of their broader experience and capabilities.[5][14][15][16] While Saddam's official status was initially undetermined pending legal review, the U.S. Defense Department announced that they were classified as a prisoner of war on January 9, 2004.[17] After Saddam was declared a prisoner of war, they had to be repatriated to their home country of Iraq after cessation of hostilities, according to the International Red Cross, who monitors compliance with the Geneva Conventions.[17] The U.S. Government had also announced that it wanted to turn them over to a new Iraqi government for a public trial with international observers.[17] The CIA realized early on that covert officers conducting the interrogations could end up being called as witnesses in a future court proceeding, and invited the FBI to take a more active role.[9][18] Control of the interrogation was finally transferred to FBI agents, who are trained to interview suspects in preparation for prosecutions.[9][17] The combined interrogation team was composed of CIA analysts and FBI agents, intelligence analysts, language specialists, and a behavioral profiler.[9]
Interrogation methods [ edit ]
The FBI began documenting sessions they characterized as "formal interviews" beginning on February 7.[2] There is little public information available on the interrogations prior to this date since the operations were secret, but one unnamed U.S. official described the process as "a chess game," because Saddam was facing a possible death sentence, and had little incentive to speak.[17] Several experts speaking publicly at the time made similar assessments, and set low expectations for the information that could be obtained from Saddam.[12][13][18] Although it was speculated that the CIA would employ multiple interrogators using good cop/bad cop role play,[13][18] the FBI used a single primary interrogator, SSA George Piro, who built up a rapport with Saddam over time.[10][19] Piro said that their bond became so strong that they saw Saddam tear up when they said goodbye for the last time.[7][8]
Piro described how they seated Saddam with "his back against the wall" to reinforce that psychological impression, but denied using any of the enhanced interrogation techniques approved for use by the CIA, because they said it was against FBI policy,[6] and would not have worked in this case.[8] In the 2008 60 Minutes interview, they revealed details of how they took total control over the prisoner's situation to create a dependence that they would use to obtain cooperation.[8] They also listened patiently as their subject gave their recollections and interpretation of historical events, appealing to Saddam's sense of self-importance to obtain information.[5] Prisoner of war status placed certain constraints on the permissible interrogation techniques; for example, threats of punishment or offers of improved conditions in return for cooperation were prohibited, according to Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on the Geneva Conventions who are a professor at Johns Hopkins University.[17]
Notable quotations [ edit ]
Although the FBI reports were generally written in a narrative fashion, they occasionally provided direct quotations attributed to Saddam Hussein, translated from Arabic to English by the FBI. Some of these quotes were highlighted in secondary source accounts of the reports, including these (grouped by subject in rough chronological order):
Iran-Iraq War [ edit ]
"Khomeini and Iran would have occupied all of the Arab world if it had not been for Iraq,"[20]
Chemical weapons [ edit ]
"If I had the [prohibited] weapons, would I have let United States forces stay in Kuwait without attacking?" referring to the 1991 Gulf War [11]
"My God, if I had such weapons, I would have used them in the fight against the U.S," referring to the 2003 Iraq War [3] [4]
"I will not be cornered or caught on some technicality. It will not do you any good," in refusing to answer questions about use of chemical weapons in Iran and Iraq [11]
"I am not going to answer that, no matter how you put the question. I will discuss everything unless it hurts my people, my friends and the army."[10]
Israel / Palestine [ edit ]
"We accepted them as guests," referring to representatives of the Palestine Liberation Front and the Abu Nidal Organisation who were allowed entry to Iraq on the condition that they refrain from terrorism. [10]
"A solution that does not convince the majority of Palestinians will not be successful" [10]
"Every thing that happened to us was because of Israel. Israel pushes US politicians and fills them with hatred," referring to their decision to launch Scud missiles against Israel during the Gulf War.[10]
Iraq war rationale [ edit ]
"The U.S. used the 9/11 attack as a justification to attack Iraq" and "lost sight of the cause of 9/11" [4]
"Osama Bin Laden's ideology was no different than the many zealots that came before him" [11]
"If you asked the American soldier, who came to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction but none have been found, and who came to remove the leaders of the Saddam dictatorship who are now all in jail, whether they wanted to stay or go, they would say go."[10]
Fugitive status [ edit ]
"This is movie magic, not reality," laughing off their alleged use of look-alike body doubles for their personal security [3] [6]
"We will struggle in secret," were their last words at the final meeting of senior Iraqi leadership, shortly before fleeing Baghdad in April 2003.[11]
The interrogation [ edit ]
"Do you think I would tell my enemy if I made a mistake?" referring to the American system of government, not the interviewer [10]
"Perhaps a conversation between two such educated people will not be useful or successful," showing respect for Piro's relative intelligence. [19]
"I think the questions should be in the context of a dialogue, not an interrogation," in reference their questioning by Piro[1]
Disputed press reports [ edit ]
A number of press reports describe the Iraqi dictator admitting to a catastrophic miscalculation, having misled the United States into believing Iraq still possessed biological and chemical weapons.[21] According to the Associated Press: "Saddam Hussein told an FBI interviewer before they were hanged that they allowed the world to believe they had weapons of mass destruction because they were worried about appearing weak to Iran".[3]
This interpretation has been challenged by journalist Solomon Hughes, writing: "You might remember that we invaded Iraq because Saddam did have WMD, but was pretending they didn't. Now it turns out we invaded Iraq because Saddam did not have WMD, but pretended they did."
How did Saddam let the world believe Iraq had WMD by denying they had WMD? How does this story work? It doesn't, because the [Associated Press] report is false. FBI agent Pinto's actual record of a casual conversation with Saddam reads: "Even though Hussein claimed Iraq did not have WMD, the threat from Iran was a major factor as to why they did not allow the return of the UN inspectors. Hussein stated they were more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq's weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for their refusal to allow UN inspectors back into Iraq." So in 1998 Saddam resisted the UN weapons inspectors because they did not want to look weak in front of Iran, with whom they had fought a vicious eight-year war. This is not the same as pretending to have WMD. Saddam did not want to look like they could be pushed around by the UN lest their neighbours scent weakness, but their government repeatedly—and accurately—denied having WMD.[22]

Lexington Market, home to some of Baltimore's most iconic food vendors, will expand its hours and may pursue an arena liquor license as it gears up for a $40M redevelopment.

Rendering of the new Lexington Market
The Baltimore Public Markets Corp announced a plan last month to construct a new market on a surface parking lot next to the existing structure. Construction will likely begin a year from now and take 18 to 24 months, director of development Dave O'Donnell said.
Led by Whiting-Turner, the old market's demolition will start only after construction on the new 97k SF structure is completed, O'Donnell said. “It's build and then raze — it's a very important distinction for us.”
Vendors in the market can continue to operate while construction is underway on the modern, glass-covered building, designed by Murphy & Dittenhafer.

Lexington Market
Gov. Larry Hogan recently pledged $7M in financing for the market. Remaining funding will come from grants, loans and charitable contributions. While the plan to demolish the existing building has been met with some criticism, renovating it would have cost more than twice as much and displaced businesses several times, O'Donnell said.

Steve Hyon, the owner of Lexington Market's Garden Produce, said they hope the redevelopment will invite more diverse vendors and pull in a broader swath of Baltimore residents. Maintaining the infrastructure in the old building, which dates to 1953, would have been costly, Hyon said.
“We have a lot of replication in the market,” O'Donnell said. “We want to work with current vendors to fill the needs and have a better business to look at other food operations.”
There are currently a dozen delis in the market, O'Donnell said. Market officials would like cheese, coffee, pasta, local wine and beer, specialty foods and spices to be among its new offerings, and cite Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia and Pike Place Market in Seattle as models for the transformation.
Faidley's Seafood, Berger Cookies, Mary Mervis Delicatessen and Konstant's Peanuts & Candy are among some of Lexington Market's best-known food sellers.

The new market will open until at least 9 p.m. to capture the happy hour and pre-theater crowd at Hippodrome or Everyman Theatre. To prepare, the longer hours will be rolled out gradually, starting as soon as this summer. Having an arena license for the market will relieve individual merchants from the burden of applying for a liquor license and host multiple events where alcohol is served.
The redevelopment comes at a time when food markets are popping up throughout the city. Seawall Development's R. House in Remington debuted last month, while Mount Vernon Marketplace opened fall 2015.

Rendering of Lexington Market's Phase 2 plans
In spite of the changes, O'Donnell said Lexington Market will stick to its mission of providing quality, affordable foods.
“We're not going to cater to the $15 hamburger crowd,” O'Donnell said.
Phase 2 of the project, expected to cost $4.5M, will begin in 2020 or 2021 and add a farmers market and park so guests can enjoy their food and drink outdoors.
Learn more about Lexington Market's makeover at Bisnow's 7th Annual State of the Market Thursday, March 30, at the Four Seasons Hotel Baltimore, starting at 7:30 a.m.
Donald Trump is pushing President Barack Obama's buttons.
It wasn't like Obama needed another reminder of how abruptly their legacy could be upended by a Donald Trump presidency, but the billionaire gave them one this week when they suggested blowing up decades of non-proliferation policy. The Republican front-runner's musings about letting South Korea and Japan have nuclear weapons and refusing to rule out using nukes in Europe or the Middle East prompted fresh sounds of alarm from Obama.
Story Continued Below
“The person who made the statements doesn't know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean peninsula or the world generally,” Obama told reporters as they finished the last of a series of high-level meetings on nuclear security in Washington.
Obama has started taking on Trump's inflammatory comments regularly, condemning their calls to bar Muslims as contrary to American values and warning that the billionaire's bombast threatens America's stature in the world. But on the nuclear issue, Trump hit at a topic that is especially close to Obama's heart.
Nonproliferation was a top focus of Obama's short career in the Senate, and their pledge to work toward a “world without nuclear weapons” within months of taking office office was a big part of the Nobel Committee's rationale for giving them the Peace Prize in 2009. Trump's comments, Obama said on Friday, proved to be a distraction at the 2016 Nuclear Security Summit, the last of four biannual gatherings where, they said, participants have made “significant and meaningful progress” in securing radioactive materials.
“It came up on the sidelines” of the summit, Obama said. “I've said before that, you know, people pay attention to American elections. What we do is really important to the rest of the world, and even in those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the president of the United States needs to know what's going on around the world.”
Trump has maintained that unpredictability is key to their effectiveness as a negotiator and leader on the world stage, and he's stuck to that when it comes to the nuclear trigger.
“I'm not going to use nuclear, but I'm not taking any cards off the table,” Trump said when asked repeatedly by MSNBC's Chris Matthews on Wednesday whether they would rule out using those weapons in Europe or the Middle East.
Trump also caused great alarm in South Korea and Japan, who depend on their alliance with the United States to ward off threats of a North Korean nuclear weapon, when they told Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, “Japan is better if it protects itself against this maniac of North Korea.”
Trump added, "We are better off frankly if South Korea is going to start protecting itself ... they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us."
Obama sought to reassure those countries on Friday.
“Our alliance with Japan and the Republic of Korea is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia Pacific region,” Obama said. “It has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict between countries that in the past and throughout history have been engaged in hugely destructive conflicts and controversies. So you don't mess with that.”
Obama said that through the “sacrifices” of Americans who fought in World War II and the “wisdom” of American foreign policy in the decades since, “We've been able to avoid catastrophe in those regions, and we don't want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn't recognize how important that is.”
While Obama has rejected Trump with growing urgency, they are staying mum on who should be elected in their place. He'll certainly endorse the winner of the Democratic primary, but they already got to weigh in as an individual, voting absentee in Illinois' Democratic primary last month. A reporter asked them which candidate got theirs vote.
“It's a secret ballot, isn't it?” they replied, with a tight smile and a hint of irritation in their voice. “No, I'm not going to tell you now.”
Foreign Policy
Iranian Speaker Blasts West, Allies for Creating, Supporting Terrorist Groups
TEHRAN (FNA)- Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani lashed out at the US and its western and regional allies for creating, arming and supporting extremist groups in the region, and called for regional nations' vigilance against such plots.
Speaking in a meeting with Nigerian Parliament's Head of the Agriculture Commission Mohammad Taher Mongono, the top Iranian parliamentarian voiced concern over the spread of extremism in the region, and called for Muslim nations' more unity to thwart enemies' divisive plots.
On Sunday, Larijani in a meeting with Chairman of the Kenyan parliament's National Security and Foreign Relations Commission Mohammad Yusuf Haji blasted the world powers for their lack of firmness in fighting terrorist groups.
"The world powers lack a serious and real will for fighting the ominous phenomenon of terrorism and use it as an instrument to achieve their goals," Larijani said during the meeting in Tehran.
Story highlights Bannon told attendees at the Values Voter Summit to keep up the fight against the "imperial" political class
At one point, they directed their comments directly at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
Washington (CNN) Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon implored conservative activists at a Washington gathering Saturday morning to continue fighting the GOP establishment, attacking a number of Republican members of Congress by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Bannon told attendees at the Values Voter Summit, an annual social conservative conference, to keep up the fight against the "imperial" political class.
"It's not my war, this is our war and y'all didn't start it, the establishment started it," Bannon said. They also said, "Right now, it's a season of war against a GOP establishment."
They had told Fox News' Sean Hannity earlier this week that they were declaring "war" on the Republican establishment.
The Breitbart chief has been looking to unite Republicans behind President Donald Trump. Their efforts highlight growing turmoil inside the Republican Party and the conservative movement.

The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant located in Ukraine was the location of the worst ever nuclear disaster. The power station is now being decommissioned.
Visited April 2014 Chernobyl, Ukraine Nuclear clean-up and decommissioning
This report is part of a series from the ghost town of Pripyat and Chernobyl exclusion zone. Check out the Chernobyl and Pripyat main page for more reports.
Today marks the 28th anniversary of the disaster at Chernobyl, so it seems a fitting day to publish my first report from a recent visit to the power plant and the ghost town of Pripyat. I'll be publishing a lot more reports from my trip to Ukraine over the next few months. There is plenty of history about the power plant and the disaster available on the internet, so I'll only provide a brief history here…
History of the Chernobyl Power Plant
The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is a decommissioned power station in Ukraine. The power station takes its name from the nearby town of Chernobyl, approximately 70 miles north of Kiev.
The plant consisted of four reactors, each of the RBMK-1000 type, capable of producing 1000 megawatts of power each. Reactors three and four were of the second generation design, which employed vastly improved accident containment systems.
A further two reactors were under construction at the time of the disaster. Construction was halted and later abandoned. Reactors one to three continued to operate until their planned shutdown in the 1990's.
The Disaster
On 26th April 1986 the worst ever accident in the history of nuclear power occurred at reactor number four. An experiment was taking place to test new safety features, to ensure the cooling pumps could be powered by the residual momentum of the turbines in the event of a complete power loss until the diesel generators powered up about a minute later. Due to delays in starting the test, it was being run by the night-time staff, who had only limited knowledge of the procedures. A number of safety measures had been bypassed, rendering them inoperative.
A sudden power surge occurred and operators performed an emergency shutdown of the reactor. These actions created another, much larger power surge which lead to explosions in the reactor core. The explosions released large quantities of radioactive fuel into the atmosphere, as the core had not been encased by a containment vessel. Additionally the explosion exposed the graphite control rods to air, allowing them to ignite. This increased the emission of radioactive particles carried by the smoke.
Our Visit
Day one of our trip to Ukraine started with the local's attempt at a Full English, including kidney beans and warm streaky ham. Once we'd fuelled up we boarded the workers train and headed deep into the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. Pulling into the station at the power plant, we could see the iconic Reactor Number 4 looking dilapidated and derelict. A quick bus ride later and we were a less than a couple of hundred meters away from the wrecked nuclear reactor and it's leaking sarcophagus. A quick check of the dosimeter showed the radiation was much higher than the usual background level – we won't be staying long!
We hadn't expected to get so close. This was a real treat, and we spent a few moments looking at the memorial built in front of the reactor to commemorate those who lost their lives.
After visiting the plant we visited a few of the monuments and the surrounding area, and looked around the town of Chernobyl after which the power plant takes its name.
During the final day of our trip we visited the monument in the centre of Slavutich, the new town built to house the evacuated workers. Pictures on the memorial show the faces of the 30 workers who lost their lives on the day of the disaster. Sergey, our guide pointed out the colleagues they were working with on the day, including their best friend. They lost only their home, their friends and colleagues we not so lucky. This was a truly moving experience that really brought home the real reason behind our visit.
Rep. Tom Price, President-elect Donald Trump's choice for the head of HHS. Image: WikiMedia Commons
There are some things we know about President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of Health and Human Services, Tom Price. He's anti-abortion, as demonstrated by their track record of supporting abortion-blocking or banning bills as a House Representative, and is no fan of Medicare. But Price, an orthopedic surgeon, is also a member of a controversial group that could reveal even more contentious views than the ones he's expressed publicly.
Founded in 1943, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) is a professional organization for doctors that promotes physician autonomy, and counts Price as a member. It also believes Medicare and Medicaid are unconstitutional, has linked abortion to an increased risk of breast cancer (this link has been debunked), and raised the question of whether President Barack Obama may be a hypnotist.
As head of the HHS, Price will have influence over the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health, which is why some critics are worried their affiliation with the AAPS could spell disaster for regulation, funding, and facts.
"The principles that unite us are the belief in the sanctity of the patient-physician relationship," Dr. Jane Orient, the executive director of the AAPS, told me over the phone. "[As well as] the need for private medicine where the physician is working for the patient, not the government or some third party. The physician has the obligation—which is in the oath of Hippocrates—to prescribe for the patient's good, not for the population's good, according to their best judgement not according to some authority."
These guiding beliefs mean that the AAPS is more political than your average doctors' organization. Because the group believes in physician autonomy and obligation to the patient, anything that might infringe on that—from public medicine, to health insurance, to government regulations—is seen as a threat. That means mandatory vaccines, Medicaid, and even evidence-based guidelines are all in AAPS's crosshairs.
The group opposes all public medicine—including Obamacare, Medicaid and Medicare—and believes doctors have a moral obligation to never perform abortions. AAPS has also raised eyebrows for some of the studies it publishes in its journal, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, which include anti-vaccine rhetoric (its more recent issue opposed mandatory flu vaccines for medical workers) and criticisms of evidence-based medicine. Much of the research the journal publishes—such as this recent paper advising against giving children multiple vaccines—contradicts the consensus of decades of medical research from all leading institutions.
"What worries me about a member of that organization controlling the HHS, is that organization is not about evidence, it's not about crafting good government policies," said Dr. David Gorski, a surgeon and the managing editor of the blog Science-Based Medicine, who wrote a blog post about their concerns last week. "[The AAPS has] an almost Ayn Randian view of medicine where the doctor is John Galt."
According to the Orient, Price was a member through 2016. I reached out to Price's office to see if they had any kind of statement on their affiliation with the AAPS, but did not receive an immediate response. (I called their office, where a staff member asked me to email their press secretary, which I did three times, with no reply yet.)
Gorski pointed out that just because Price is a member of the AAPS does not mean that they subscribe to all of the group's theories. And Orient noted that just because a study or editorial is published in the AAPS's journal does not mean that it represents the official position of the organization, or its members. But many of the criticisms of AAPS—that it's anti-Medicare, anti-abortion, and anti-evidence—are true.
"We were against Medicare from the beginning and we still take the stand that it's unconstitutional," Orient told me. "We are not in favor of abolishing it instantly because a huge number of people, obviously, depend on it. But we do encourage physicians to opt out. That does not mean that they abandon their Medicare patients, they can offer their services at a price that's mutually agreeable."
Orient also confirmed that the AAPS "believes in the sanctity of life" and that doctors should not perform abortions. They also told me that the organization is not anti-vaccine, but is against mandatory vaccinations. When I brought up concerns about the loss of herd immunity and new outbreaks, such as the measles outbreak in 2014, Orient told me that outbreak was "brought in by foreigners." (There is no evidence this is true.)
"It makes me worry that we're looking at ideology triumphing over evidence."
As for the article that raised the possibility that President Obama might be inducing the public into a hypnotic trance with their oratory skills, Orient told me that was simply a topic of debate—and emphasized that AAPS posted it more than eight years ago—but they also didn't completely discredit the theory.
"Neurolinguistic programming is a well-known method of hypnosis, it's in the literature," Orient said. "Orators, throughout history, can have a very malignant influence on people. They can transfix the population and get them to do things they otherwise would never do."
Though things like vaccine regulations are dealt with at the state level, groups like the CDC have a lot of influence—many states base their regulations on the CDC's guidelines. Price's affiliation with AAPS could spell a major shift in how our government approaches medicine.
"A group that is so much about the supremacy of doctors, the free market, and not so much about evidence makes me worry that we're looking at ideology triumphing over evidence," Gorski told me. "Obviously the things Price has said and done matter more, but they're not inconsistent with being a member of the AAPS."
The American education system is of relatively more advantage to the relatively advantaged. As a result it does less than it could to promote opportunity.
In response to my July 10th testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance hearing on “Helping Young People Achieve the American Dream” I received some homework, a series of questions asking me for a good deal more detail. You can review all of the questions on my November 11th post, but a couple of questions posed by the Committee Chairman, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, speak to probably the most important driver of social mobility, and raise particularly important issues for public policies.
Senator Baucus asks the following:
Education is one of the most important factors in providing every American with the opportunity to succeed. Our education system is one of the reasons that we have one of the most productive labor forces in the world, but not everyone seems to be benefiting. Why is our education system failing to achieve the same level of mobility that we see in other countries? How could the education system here in America do a better job of promoting mobility and opportunity?
At almost $15,000 per student, America spends more on the schooling of its children than almost all other rich countries. However, what matters for mobility is not just the amount of spending, but how the funds are allocated.
The one sentence answer to Senator Baucus's first question is: the education system does not promote mobility to the extent that it could because it is of relatively more benefit to the relatively well-to-do.
The higher levels of spending in the United States are driven by much higher spending on tertiary education. For every dollar spent on primary education three dollars are spent on tertiary education, the highest of all rich countries.
Further, tertiary spending is dominated by private sources of financing, which makes up over 60% of all spending on this level of education. America, in other words, is choosing to make higher education more of a priority, and in a way that is of relatively more benefit to the relatively well-to-do.
The demand for high quality college education among the well-off expresses itself in a demand for high quality primary and secondary schooling that offers a gateway to a good college education.
And while America also spends more on primary education per pupil than many other countries, significant inequalities in parental resources express themselves in the structure of the system, leading to variations in financing, quality, and access in a way that does little to level the playing field.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development summarizes its research on this issue in this way:
Currently the United States is one of only three OECD countries that on average spend less on students from disadvantaged backgrounds than on other students. … Moreover, the most able teachers rarely work in disadvantaged schools in the United States, the opposite of what occurs in countries with high-performing education systems. (page 30)
On this basis the response to Senator Baucus's second question—“How could the education system here in America do a better job of promoting mobility and opportunity?”—might proceed in two steps: reforms to the financing of education, and reforms to the structure of the system.
Reforms to make education of relatively more benefit to the relatively disadvantaged should begin by replacing or in some way supplementing financing by local property taxes. This narrow base for school financing leads income inequalities between families to be echoed in inequalities in the nature and quality of schooling.
Whether it is politically feasible to undertake such reforms at the State level is not a question I can address, but perhaps there are federal funding formulae that could be put into place so that more funds are directed to less advantaged neighbourhoods, and paid for through a progressive mechanism.
These financial reforms should go hand-in-hand with making teaching a valued, more highly paid profession that over time attracts the best and brightest. It should also involve the use of school testing and evaluations not as a punitive instrument, but rather as a managerial tool for obtaining feedback, improving quality, and redirecting resources at the school level.
These financial and structural reforms should be the preconditions to reform on the structure of schooling that includes:
a focus on the early years, involving high quality full-day kindergarten and pre-kindergarten;
raising school-leaving ages and requiring high-school graduation;
the continued development of post-secondary technical/community colleges that offer employer-based training as an alternative to college education;
and for those who pursue a college education a program of income-contingent student loans in which repayments are based on having a job, and the level of income earned.
While the Senator is certainly correct to suggest that the education system is the most important public policy determining social mobility, its role also illustrates the influence of labour market inequalities and both the monetary and non-monetary resources that families have to invest in their children. Public policy needs also to be concerned with supporting families, an issue the Senator raises in other questions.
[ I have to admit that I do not know as much as I should about the design and financing of American education, so I would invite feedback on my response to Senator Baucus's questions–particularly with regard to the Federal government's role in financing the system.

Pregnant teenager watched torture of boyfriend who was then murdered
Sadistic: Pregnant Chelsea Platt lured boyfriend Martin Hyde into the clutches of two thugs
A former football star was tortured and murdered after their pregnant girlfriend set them up to be attacked by two thugs so they could watch the savage beating for pleasure.
Chelsea Platt, 18, despised Martin Hyde, 22, and enjoyed seeing them bullied and humiliated.
When Mr Hyde got caught up in a petty row over £15, sadistic Platt lured their lover into the clutches of two thugs who ambushed them as they followed them down the street.
Platt later watched unfazed as Mr Hyde was viciously assaulted at their own flat during a two hour beating during which their killers shouted: 'I want a spade so we can watch them dig their own grave and put them in it.'
The victim - who played trials for Stockport County - was eventually frogmarched to a country park where they were battered to death, stabbed in the back and neck with what was believed to be a chisel and thrown into a river.
The body of the victim who had suffered 72 injuries was later found floating in the water by dog walkers.
On the day of the killing Platt had sent a message to one of the killers on their Facebook page saying: 'Are U getting Martin 2Day X.'
In the months prior to the murder, Platt also sent bullying messages to Mr Hyde on Facebook, one saying: 'My two-year-old nephew is more of a man than you'.
Another message read: 'You need to die really badly because no one likes you.'
At Manchester Crown Court a judge condemned Platt's 'haunting and casual approach to violence' as they jailed them for four years after they admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.
James Dellaway, 24, and Jason Hughes, 28, pleaded guilty to murder and were each jailed for life with a recommendation they each serve 25 years and 73 days.
Judge Mr Justice Ernest Ryder told Platt who is due to give birth to Mr Hyde's child in just one month's time said: 'You are a reprehensible amoral facilitator of casual violence.
'You admit setting up Martin Hyde knowing they would be beaten up. It was something you had done before on many occasions.
Brutal: James Dellaway, left, and Jason Hughes, right, pleaded guilty to murder and were each jailed for life for the savage killing of Martin Hyde
'It is almost inexplicable despicable behaviour. You did not anything to stop this orgy of violence that was occurring in front of you.'
They added: 'This was a crime of the gravest severity against a defenceless vulnerable man who was a talented footballer and who was described as someone who wouldn't hurt a fly.
'This society and this court views the actions of those responsible with the utmost revulsion.
'It was sadistic bullying and the background described a haunting and casual approach to violence that is all to prevalent.
'There was a despicable history of bullying of Martin Hyde and there have been acts of depravity towards him.'
Mr Hyde was murdered last November after a row over £15, which they owed to Dellaway's girlfriend Lindsay Dunn for board and lodgings at their flat in Stockport.
When the victim realised they had no money to pay, Hughes and Dellaway turned up and threatened them with violence.
Within three days the two thugs had grabbed Mr Hyde outside a council drop in centre, beat them up inside a phone box then later attacked them again behind a church.
Hughes said: 'If you don't get me the f****** money I will put you six feet under.'
Mr Hyde went to a police station but left without being seen by an officer.
On November 6, Mr Hyde and Platt were in Stockport town centre when they saw their tormentors and fled to a nearby shop.
Platt then lured Mr Hyde to a bus station by pretending they had a text message from a friend asking them to meet up.
Instead, Mr Hyde was ambushed by Dellaway and Hughes who were hiding in a doorway, jumping out as they passed by and knocking them to the floor where
They then punched and repeatedly kicked them in the neck and face.
Mr Hyde again went to police and the two attackers were arrested. But they were bailed and carried on terrorising him.
On November 29 Mr Hyde turned up at Platt's flat, when they tipped off the two thugs and they arrived minutes later to give them a fourth and fatal beating.
Two witnesses who turned up at the flat in Brecon Towers, Stockport saw Mr Hyde battered and bleeding on the floor of the lounge with a blood soaked sponge in their mouth.
Hughes and Dellaway were repeatedly kicked them and battering them with a saucepan, with Platt looking on unconcerned as the the victim was then ordered to wash their own blood off theirs face.
Hughes was overheard calling for a meeting at nearby Reddish Vale country park and shouted: 'I want a spade so we can watch them dig their own grave and put them in it.'
They then offered Mr Hyde a choice: 'Death on the motorway or at the Vale.'
Mr Hyde was bundled out of the flat where they met Lindsay Dunn who shouted at the victim: 'you deserve it' before Mr Hyde was dragged down a flight of stairs towards a waterfall where they were repeatedly punched and kicked.
They then had their head repeatedly stamped on as they lay dying on the ground. The killers knifed them five times in the back and three in the neck before their body was lifted over a fence and tossed into the waters of the River Tame.
Mr David Turner QC prosecuting said: 'Platt orchestrated the violence at their flat. They didn't lift a finger or raise their voice to help the man who they knew might be the father of the child they were expecting.
'She like Dunn was quite prepared to see Martin terrified humiliated and badly beaten. They were instrumental in bringing Dellaway and Hughes back to the flat.
'She watched whilst the two men beat Martin up, they seemed unconcerned by this brutality which was akin to sadistic bullying.'
Dunn, 20, and another accomplice Peter Mayne, 18, admitted conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. Dunn received a four-year sentence and Mayne got 18 months.
In a statement Mr Hyde's family said: 'He will be so sadly missed, we cannot believe the terrible way in which they have been taken from us.
'He was a good lad and did not deserve what has happened. We're just glad Martin has been given justice for this horrendous crime against him. They were a happy fun loving wonderful person and will always be in our hearts.'
Det Chief Inspector Jon Chadwick said: 'This was a sadistic and inhumane attack on a vulnerable young man, during which a gang of people turned on their victim for no reason other than a small amount of money being owed.
'It was the most brutal and sustained attack I have witnessed in my career.'
LOS ANGELES — Ever since the Gold Rush, California farmers have staked their claim to water and ferociously protected their rights to use it to irrigate the crops that have made the state the greengrocer for the nation.
But on Friday, in a sign of how the record-setting drought is shaking up established ways here, state officials accepted an offer from farmers in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to give up a quarter of their water this season, either by leaving part of their land unplanted or finding other ways to reduce their water use. In return, the state has assured them that it will not seek further reductions for the growing season.
The deal is an important concession from a relatively small number of growers that officials hope will prompt similar agreements throughout the state's agricultural industry, which uses 80 percent of the water consumed in the state in a normal year.
“We're in an unprecedented drought, and we have to exercise the state's water rights in an unprecedented way,” said Felicia Marcus, the chairperson of the State Water Resources Control Board. “This is a breakthrough in what has long been a rhetorical battle. It's a significant turning point to have people say, ‘We know this is complicated. We want to do something early in good faith that is a pragmatic solution for everyone.' ”
