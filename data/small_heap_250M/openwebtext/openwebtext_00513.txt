"The ruble has been on a tear from very depressed levels and this has a lot to do with oil, which is a huge performer," Joseph Dayan, head of markets at BCS Financial, told CNBC on Tuesday.
"Close to 60 percent of Russia's budget is dependent on oil or oil-related income, so not surprisingly, both of these moves are going together. There are other things that are coming together for the Russian story – geopolitical factors in particular," Dayan added.

Oil prices were trading at 2015 peaks on Wednesday, while the Russian rouble has soared almost 14 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year to about 50, making it one of the best-performing global currencies.
Dayan said Russia was also benefiting from the fact that fighting in Ukraine has ebbed in the past few months. Moscow has been under Western sanctions since annexing Ukraine's Crimea region in March 2014.
It's those sanctions, together with a rout in oil prices in the second half of last year that helped spark a currency crisis, as the ruble fell sharply to a record low against the dollar at the end of last year.
Two offseasons ago, the Nets acquired Paul Pierce with championship aspirations. But after an ugly split, Pierce hasn't shied from expressing his distaste in how things turned out.
Pierce hasn't ever been known for holding things back. That's why they call him “The Truth,” after all: he's willing to speak his mind on any situation. And in an interview with Jackie MacMullan of ESPN.com, Pierce did just that, ripping his former Nets teammates and the organization.
Pierce, who spent one season in Brooklyn after a blockbuster traded that brought him and Kevin Garnett to the Nets, said his situation in Brooklyn was “horrible” and that veteran players didn't care enough in games and practices.
An excerpt from the interview:
“I'm much happier,” he said. “It was a tough situation (in Brooklyn) last year. Horrible, really. “It was just the guys' attitudes there. It wasn't like we were surrounded by a bunch of young guys. They were vets who didn't want to play and didn't want to practice. I was looking around saying, ‘What's this?' Kevin (Garnett) and I had to pick them up every day in practice. “If me and Kevin weren't there, that team would have folded up. That team would have packed it in. We kept them going each and every day.”
Pierce added that Deron Williams puzzled him, citing the spotlight of NYC, and that the quiet Joe Johnson “doesn't want much attention”:
“Before I got there, I looked at Deron as an MVP candidate,” Pierce said. “But I felt once we got there, that's not what he wanted to be. He just didn't want that. “I think a lot of the pressure got to him sometimes. This was his first time in the national spotlight. The media in Utah is not the same as the media in New York, so that can wear on some people. I think it really affected him.” Pierce said veteran Joe Johnson was an affable professional but also a reluctant leader. “Joe is quiet,” Pierce noted. “He doesn't want much attention. He doesn't say much. “There are a lot of secondary guys on that team. KG and I went there looking at them as the main guys who would push us, because we were advancing in years. But we ended up doing all the pushing.”
Following the Nets' second-round exit to the Miami Heat, the Nets elected not to re-sign Pierce after one season, and the forward went to the Washington Wizards on a two-year deal worth $11 million. The deal would have cost the Nets over $20 million per season when factoring in the luxury tax, and after some initial discussions, the Nets never returned to the table.
Pierce says that Garnett would have played a factor in him returning to the team had he received an offer, but later became disgruntled with how the Nets “(didn't) appreciate” Garnett's influence. Garnett was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves at the trade deadline, where he spent the first 12 seasons of his career:
“I would have stayed in Brooklyn because of Kevin,” Pierce said. “I told him, ‘I don't really like this situation but I would never leave you if you want me to stay.' But they decided not to re-sign me so I never had to make a choice. I would never have left Kevin like that.” Garnett was traded in February to Minnesota, where he will eventually assume a front-office role as a part-owner. “He's happy,” Pierce said. “I'm glad he waived his no-trade clause. I told him, ‘They don't appreciate you in Brooklyn, man.' They didn't even use him right. “He's where he's supposed to be. He IS Minnesota. He never sold his house there.”
Pierce's per-minute production has remained steady since leaving Brooklyn: he's averaging 12.1 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game in 72 starts for the playoff-bound Wizards, shooting 39.2 percent from three-point range.

ESPN — Wizards' Paul Pierce speaks the truth
The chase for a new centre back at the Bridge continues. According to SportItalia (via Football Italia), Chelsea will be offering €40m to Napoli for Senegalese defender Kalidou Koulibaly, along with a 400% raise on his current €1m per-year earnings.
It is believed that Napoli have already turned down offers of €30 million for Koulibaly, and their chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis isn't willing to let go of an important player without a fight. But the €40 million bid should be enough to convince the club to let go of the player, according to the report.
Last season, the 25-year-old formed a solid partnership with veteran Spanish defender Raul Albiol. The duo was a key part of Napoli's runners-up campaign in the Serie A, allowing on average on nine shots per game and conceding only 32 goals throughout the season.
Considering Chelsea's lack of depth and aging core in the centre back department, acquiring Koulibaly — or any other central defender that would offer a real upgrade to our current options — should be a priority in our transfer market dealings. Hopefully the improved offer will be enough to take him from De Laurentiis's firm grasp.
Nana Mizuki welcomed an extra-large guest on to the stage during her two-day concert at the Tokyo Dome. 80,000 people attended the "NANA MIZUKI LIVE GALAXY 2016" concerts on Saturday and Sunday to see the Cross Ange singer perform but got a special surprise when a 7.7m tall, 1.5 ton robot joined her on stage. The "GALAXY-7" moved on the stage, allowing Mizuki to sit on it during her performance of "Glorious Break" from Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX.
Mizuki performed 25 tracks on each day of the concert backed by plenty of eye-popping special effects and pyrotechnics. She entered the dome in space pod, floated over the audience while suspended by giant balloons, and sang atop a UFO.
Mizuki will release her 35th single in July. One of the songs in the single will be the opening theme song for the July television anime of Imigimuru's Kono Bijutsu-bu niwa Mondai ga Aru! (This Art Club Has a Problem!) comedy manga. Mizuki also voices the character Yumeko Tachibana in the anime itself.

The first thing you need to know is that this is no easy elective. If you want to learn about the country music superstar Dolly Parton, you'd better come prepared.
A course called Dolly's America at the University of Tennessee's main campus in Knoxville is devoted to the life story of Ms. Parton, who hails from nearby Sevier County in the eastern part of the state.
But this is much more than a surface-level study of a popular musician, said Lynn Sacco, the associate professor who teaches the course. It's a thesis seminar meant for history students in the honors program, and it's meant to give students a new way of understanding Appalachia's modern history and Ms. Parton's role in it.
“It's really kind of a nerdy class,” Dr. Sacco said.
The second thing you need to know is that for many natives of eastern Tennessee, Ms. Parton, 71, is known for much, much more than just music. She is an icon for a place that outsiders can sometimes underestimate, said Carson Hollingsworth, the student body president at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.

You've likely gotten used to it by now; waking up and checking Twitter early in the morning to see what your President has said, which will likely be used against him later in the day by the media. While Trump could easily avoid many of the situations he finds himself in, if he would stop tweeting, Twitter for him seems more like a morning glass of vodka to an alcoholic than simply a social media platform.
This morning is no different, as the 45th President of the United States posted three tweets in a span of approximately one hour (between 5:40 AM and 6:40 AM EST). The first one, uncharacteristically poking fun at one of his many typos, was light-hearted and sort of fun, but the next two were flat-out lies. They read as follows:
“So now it is reported that the Democrats, who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia, don't want him to testify. He blows away their… case against him & now wants to clear his name by showing “the false or misleading testimony by James Comey, John Brennan…” Witch Hunt!”
In these tweets it's clear that Trump is trying to somehow prove that there is no Russian story by using the fact that the House Intel Committee has delayed Page's testimony. While there could be numerous reasons for the delay, it's likely not the fact that they believe Page to be innocent. The President claims that Page wants to ‘clear his name' from the ‘misleading testimony by James Comey and John Brennan'. The problem is that neither Comey nor Brennan even mentioned Page's name in their testimony to Congress.
Page's name was brought up by the House panel numerous times to Comey back in late March, who gave a pretty cookie-cutter answer of ‘Not going to answer that,' every time it was mentioned. John Brennan, on the other hand, wasn't even asked once about Carter Page in his testimony earlier this month.
So how will Page clear his name from the misleading testimony of Comey and Brennan before Congress, when there doesn't exist any testimony, misleading or not, discussing Carter Page? I guess you can't expect much from a man who recently cited Maroon 5 in a letter to the Justice Department.
A Dartmouth College survey found that, all else equal, students favor hiring nonwhite professors and admitting nonwhite students over their white peers.
Greater faculty diversity is among the most frequent demands made by student activists, with 80 schools having received such ultimatums to date, according to TheDemands.org. Recently, two Dartmouth professors surveyed students from their school about the trend, asking them to choose between hypothetical candidates in both hiring and admissions scenarios.
“White students overall...are effectively indifferent to a candidate's race and gender.”
The polls were conducted by Social Sciences and Government professor John Carey and Japanese Studies and Government professor Yusaku Horiuchi, and revealed relatively consistent bias in favor of nonwhite candidates across almost all groups of students.
“First, Dartmouth students broadly support more demographic diversity in faculty recruitment and in undergraduate admissions,” the authors begin a summary of their conclusions.
“Second, some groups of students want a diverse faculty more than others, but effectively all groups want a diverse student body. Third, we found no evidence that groups are polarized about diversity. We never found one group—say, African American students—whose preferences directly oppose students from another group—say, whites.”
The professors first share their findings regarding diversity and choices to admit hypothetical students.
“Holding all else equal, students preferred an African American or Native American applicant by 15 percentage points over a white applicant, and a Hispanic or Latino applicant over a white applicant by about 7 percentage points,” report Carey and Horiuchi. “They slightly preferred a woman over a man; strongly preferred a socioeconomically disadvantaged student over the affluent; and a first-generation college applicant over one coming from a family where college has been the norm.”
Responses concerning faculty diversity reflected a similar preference for hiring minority professors over their white peers.
“All else equal, [students] preferred an African American candidate by 12 percentage points over a white candidate; an American Indian or Hispanic by 9 percentage points; and an Asian American by 5 percentage points.
“But that preference varied by the demographics of the students,” say the professors. “African American students place tremendous priority on recruiting non-white—and especially black—faculty, preferring an African American faculty candidate by 51 percentage points over an equivalent white applicant, holding all other attributes equal. (White students are also more likely to select the African American faculty candidate than the white one, but by a far lesser degree.)
“And Dartmouth women consider diversity a higher priority than do men. Yes, they want more female faculty members, but they're just as committed to more faculty members from all underrepresented race and ethnicity categories.”
“No group opposed diversity,” the study asserted. “White students overall, male students overall, and white males in particular are effectively indifferent to a candidate's race and gender.”

In recent days we have seen political action committees (PACs) claiming they are "prohibited" from running political ads in primary states due to "new rules" regarding "electioneering communications." As explained below, these claims are incorrect. What they are really doing is trying to avoid the need to reveal the identity of their contributors, following a US District Court decision in March.
Under Federal Election law, an "electioneering communication" is a broadcast, cable or satellite communication that refers to a clearly identified candidate for federal office within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of an election, targeted to 50,000 or more people in the state or district the candidate seeks to represent. For President and Vice Presidential candidates, an "electioneering communication" is one that can be received by 50,000 or more people within 30 days of a state primary or the nominating convention.
By federal statute, sponsors of "electioneering communications" must disclose the names and addresses of each donor who contributed $1000 or more to the sponsoring organization. This is is the provision that led to the US District Court decision at issue.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) enacted a rule requiring disclosure of donors whose donation was made "for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications." Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen challenged this rule on grounds that it created a loophole in the law. According to Van Hollen, fewer than 10% of the contributors to electioneering communications in 2010 were disclosed to the FEC.
The US District Court agreed with Van Hollen, holding that the statute requires disclosure of ALL contributors of $1000 or more to organizations placing "electioneering communications," even if the contributions were not made for the specific purpose of funding the electioneering communication. The number of contributors that would need to be disclosed under this ruling could be quite high, particularly since the US Supreme Court allowed corporations and unions to fund independent electioneering communications in its landmark 2009 Citizens United case discussed here.
So, while some PACs erroneously claim they are "prohibited" from running electioneering communications due to a recent "FCC" ruling, the truth is that they do not want to subject themselves to the broad disclosure requirements established in the Van Hollen case. The case is on appeal to the DC Circuit, so we should soon know whether the FEC or the US District Court was right in their respective interpretations of the disclosure statute.
In the meantime, "electioneering communications" can be avoided by not referring to a specific candidate, by avoiding states where primaries are to occur within 30 days or by communicating the message to fewer than 50,000 people. While these ads will still be considered "independent expenditures" that have their own FEC reporting requirements, they are not nearly as burdensome as those recently imposed by the court on "electioneering communications."
In late March, Apple CEO Steve Jobs took the stage with Arnold Schwarzenegger at the Lucile Packard's Children's Hospital to help drum up support for a proposed bill in California that would require individuals receiving their license to indicate whether or not they would like to be organ donors. As it stands now, drivers in California have to take pro-active steps to sign up as organ donors.
Addressing the crowd, Jobs was uncharacteristically open about his liver transplant, and recounted just how close to dying he actually was.
“I was almost one of the ones that died waiting for a liver in California last year,” Jobs said, ”there were simply not enough livers in California to go around, and my doctors here advised me to enroll in a transplant program in Memphis, where the supply-demand ratio of livers is more favorable than it is in California.”
“I was very fortunate,” Jobs continued, “Many others died waiting to receive one.”
Earlier this week, a Silicon Alley Insider reader named James emailed Jobs to thank him for his efforts in spreading awareness about the importance of organ donations and rallying up support for the proposed law.
His email reads:
Thank you, you're awesome. I lost my girlfriend on April 23, 2008 from melanoma which spread rapidly to her liver, 48 hours after we found out it spread to her liver she sadly passed away….she was only 24 and I think about her every day. I am so grateful you took time out to do this. My girlfriend and I are from Cupertino, since childhood, and it's really nice to see the hometown hero take time out to do this. Once again, thank you so much. Sincerely, James
Jobs soon replied,
Your most welcome, James. I'm sorry about your girlfriend. Life is fragile. Steve Sent from my iPad
SAI acknowledges the grammatical error in Jobs' email, but after investigating the headers, they're confident that this email did, in fact, come from Jobs himself.
In an email to SAI, James explains why chose to make his correspondence with Jobs public:
A new NBC News poll provides the first glimpse of the Republican race following the Fox News debate on Thursday.
The survey, conducted Friday and Saturday, finds Donald Trump holding his lead with 23 percent support among Republican primary voters. This is consistent with a Gravis Marketing poll taken after the debate, where 19 percent of Republicans said Trump won the debate.
The Gravis poll found that more Republicans, 22 percent, felt Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon and political rookie, won the debate. In the NBC poll, Carson surged into third place in the nomination contest, earning 11 percent support.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz was the second choice in the NBC Poll, receiving support from 13 percent of Republican voters. Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina was fourth, with 11 percent, following her widely recognized domination of the “undercard” debate earlier Thursday evening.
The exact breakdown and percentage of the first seven spots in the NBC poll are: Trump (23), Cruz (13), Carson (11), Fiorina (8), Rubio (8), Bush (7) and Walker (7).
In other words, the highest poll ranking of a candidate acceptable to the Republicans in D.C. is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, in fifth place with just 8 percent. This is stunning considering the obvious attacks on Trump by Fox moderators, the limited number of questions offered to Cruz and Carson and the relegation of Fiorina to a non-prime time debate slot.
In the post-debate analysis, Fox News roundly criticized Trump and heaped praise on Rubio and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a former Fox News anchor.
Obviously the NBC News poll is the first of many post-debate polls and the nomination contest is still in its very early days. Trump created a silly controversy for himself with an attack on Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly over the weekend, which isn't factored into this poll's results.
That said, something undeniably interesting is happening in the GOP nomination contest. Ratings for the Fox News debate were historic, with some 24 million Americans tuning in. The debate was one of the most watched shows on cable ever, never mind other news or political debate programs.
On Saturday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who is inexplicably also running for President, said Donald Trump was “inflicting permanent damage on the GOP.” He wants him booted from the nominating contest.
Trump is a volatile chemical, but there is no doubt his presence on the stage helped attract far more people than would have otherwise watched an early Presidential primary debate. The GOP should embrace the opportunity to reach millions of new voters with its message.
Of course, that assumes the GOP has a message it wants to communicate.
Watching both debates, it is obvious that Trump, Cruz, Carson and Fiorina were the most interesting people on the stage. The rest of the candidates were political pod people, repeating anodyne talking points that had been focus-grouped to within an inch of their lives. One would be very hard-pressed to match the text of an answer to the candidate who said it.
Americans are increasingly fed-up with politicians of all stripes. The fact that an aging hippy socialist with no prayer of becoming President (Sen. Bernie Sanders) can attract more than 10,000 people for a speech is as much an indictment of the entire political class as it is of Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Dem frontrunner.
The Presidential politics will likely settle down into its ordinary, and boring, slog through November next year. The odds still favor the two parties coughing up two uninspiring career politicians to quibble before the declining number of Americans that still participates in politics.
Or, maybe not. This early post-debate poll confirms that the public is frustrated and turned off of politicians, no matter their resume or rhetoric. For most of the people on those twin debate stages, the message is very simple: We really don't like you.
With a goal of placing a ‘washing machine in every household' and with a vision of ‘When technology meets common man, World prospers', a Mumbai based startup is aiming to offer fully functional, portable washing machines for only Rs 1500.
This is unique one-of-its-kind device to wash clothes has been named: Venus – The Mini Portable Washing Machine.
The startup has already shared their plans with crowd-sourcing platform IndieGoGo, and have pitched to raise $50,000 (Rs 30, 00,000) before December 12, 2014, which will enable them to mass-produce this exciting device, and fulfill their mission and vision.
At the time of writing, $1250 out of $50,000 has already been raised.
Piyush Agarwalla, founder of Vimbas Navrachna, the startup which has invented this idea said, “The simplicity of design will enable us to make this machine at a very low price – if mass manufactured. Making this device available in the market for an affordable price for the poor families in the third world will help millions of women who presently are forced to wash clothes by hand,”
How Will It Work?
This washing machine can be described as an electronic hand blender, which is small enough to be carried in a backpack and large enough to wash 4-5 clothes in a bucket, with strikingly good results. Every wash will take maximum 4 – 5 minutes, and it is being advised that the machine be used for 30 minutes in a day.
Here is a video which describes its functioning:
Why Should One Use It?
There are several situations wherein such portable, easy to use washing machine can come in handy, even if you have a bulky, mainstream washing machine in your home, such as:
Washing those clothes which are used to mop floor or clean the kitchen, as washing them with your clothes can be a bad choice.
Homes where there is an infant or small children, and you are required to wash their clothes separately
Washing patient's clothes to avoid infection/contamination
Washing those clothes which can leak or shed colors
Travelers and traveling salesmen can keep this portable washing machine in their backpack, and use it in hotel or lodge.
Those households which doesn't have a budget to purchase a typical washing machine

Surely no one can have failed to notice: engineered electronic intelligence in pocket-sized parameters is a formidable little weapon of potential mass destruction.
However, one must not make assumptions, since most humanity has so far failed to notice that atmospheric aerosol geoengineering is a weapon of mass destruction, I guess it should come as no surprise that ‘smart' cell phones remain largely unrecognized as the little mind-bombs that they are.
Not the sort of bombs that cause vast explosions – that form of destruction may be close to past its sell-by date for those who would engineer our futures. No need, after all, to blow us all to hell if we are perfectly happy to go there quietly, of our own accord. And many millions seem ready to do just that; led by the Pied Piper of convenience technology.
For there is a strange world out there, a virtual world, to which literally billions of people are now addicted, finding it indispensable to their daily routines.
The madness of geoengineering our climate and smart phone engineering our brains is linked. Put superficially, the more you look down at your flickering gizmo, the less likely you are to look up and witness the engineered cloud formations grid-lining our once blue skies. Or for that matter, the beauty and subtlety of nature or the grace and dignity of fine architecture.
In fact, a disposition towards ‘not seeing' has been on the rise for at least two or three decades now. It applies to vaccinations, GMOs, food additives, radiation, electro smog, and so many more creeping weapons of the ‘silent wars' assailing our planet and our physiological and mental capacities.
One might try to dismiss these devitalizing agents as necessary evils of the convenience age in a society dependent upon instant fixes, instant communications, instant satisfactions and instant just about everything. One might…until one realizes that they are impregnating and polluting our blood stream, subtly altering our DNA, and changing our very nature from the inside out … and from the outside in.
What kind of insanity is this?
Just witness the tens of thousands of spiky steel mobile phone towers that now cover the Earth, like something out of HG Wells's War of the Worlds. Each one spewing mind-altering, unseen microwaves into the surrounding community. And all because everyone has to have a cell phone with which to engage in what, for the majority, are typically banal, bland and boring conversations.
I have written before about Transhumanism (for the article, click here) and the plans for a human-engineered robotic cyber intelligence to usurp responsibility for the future (and the present) from humankind. I warned that we must be alert to this cold-blooded cybernetic concept gaining ground, especially among those who wish to divest themselves of all sense of responsibility for planetary life, and indeed the lives of future generations.
Now, I wish us to direct our attentions towards the role that the smart phone addiction is playing in hastening this further demise of Homo sapiens. It's a slippage that leads towards an almost wholly-derailed human race. One that relies on a machine to do the thinking while the time-honored neocortex loses its capacity to function; to discern between what is reality and what is virtual reality. What is actual and what is illusory. What is real and what is unreal.
Many is the occasion upon which I have taken my seat on a train and found myself surrounded on all sides by people staring hypnotically into their illuminated smart phones, tablets, iPhones/iPods, laptops, and god knows what else. Tweeting and twittering-out endless text messages to social media sites and fellow twittering twots. Watching movies; or just scrolling…scrolling…endlessly scrolling. Which rhymes with ‘strolling', but has long since usurped this pleasing outdoor pursuit.
All the while a spreading cloud of electro-smog penetrates corpuscles and brain cells alike, disrupting and distorting the wave-forms that constitute the natural channels and interface of communication between us – and indeed between all species.
We need a law, following the lines of the ‘passive smoker' rebellion – which will outlaw such activities and protect the non-user of wireless technology against brain-bending microwaves zapping the unprotected neocortex of unsuspecting neighbors. But it took around forty years of intense lobbying and tens of thousands of ‘scientific papers' to prove that smoking commercial cigarettes causes cancer. How long and how many casualties will it take to achieve protection from electromagnetic radiation?

Legislation alone achieves just so much; ‘just so little'. There are one thousand and one toxic nasties that should have been legislated against decades ago. Unless society, as a whole, is moving towards a degree of enlightened awareness, all the rules in the world are not going to alter the underlying problem: the majority of mankind prefers to be a slave than to be a leader or responsible partner within the global family of Homo sapiens.
Does it make much difference if one is a slave to a Cyborgian dynasty or to an Illuminati empire?
Not much, in my view. However, we have at least started a serious awareness raising ‘resistance' to the latter – and now know this devil better than we understand the creeping paralysis of virtual reality Transhumanism.
Of course, there are strong links between these two. The ambition has always been to hold the development of humanity in check, by whatever means. He who stands in the shadows between the CEO's of Google, Facebook and Microsoft is a fellow diner at the top table with those who stand in the shadows behind Monsanto, Cargill and Bayer. Who in turn maintain just a shoulder's distance from the shadow conductors of Raytheon's military industrial project, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and British Aerospace Ltd. Who, in their own turn, stand just a stone's throw from the Rockefeller, Rothschild and Soros banking empires. Each drinking from the others One World Cup.
Yes, we know something about this. But ‘mainstream mortal' knows next to nothing. Yet we share our journey though life with such mortals – and we cannot turn our backs.
The smart phone is the favorite toy of the non-discerning, as well as too many of the seemingly discerning. Its innocuous nature makes it particularly addictive. Hard to give up – even when you know it's cooking your brain. ‘Smart' technologies come to us as an array of seductive weapons (‘smart meters' and ‘smart cars' are just the beginning), which are clearing the way for the next generation of mind and blood altering ‘listening' technologies. Technologies that will, if the cyborgs get their way, “do our thinking for us”. And, as I have already stated, this is exactly what all too many want – and what the control system counts on – in order to spin humanity into the sticky folds of its all embracing web.
It is this slow road to asphyxiation that particularly alarms me. Each step of the take-over seems ‘just a small thing' on its own. These steps quickly add up to a deeply sinister poisoning of the sanctity of life once observed as the planned, interconnected sequence of events that they really are.
The mass indulgence in cybernetics is a fools game. It's a powerful distraction from the real task facing humanity: the discovery and realization of our still largely untapped deeper powers of love, spirit and passion. These are the qualities that will define any future worth living in, not an obsession with high tech wizardry placed on the global market by the cold, calculating minds that drive the multinational behemoths.
Yet, even as I write, there emerges another irresistible sweetener to take the cyber-slaves into their ultimate virtual reality scam: Wi-Fi ‘Cloud Technology'. A grid of all encompassing energetic Wi-Fi microwave bands, loaded with smart meter intelligence, gathering capabilities and a virtually-limitless range of capacity available to all who buy-in to its ubiquitous Eye of Horus network. A sub-reality world which is able to declare itself ‘the new reality' by dint of its calculated hold over billions who have long since given themselves over to ‘the network'. A network critical to the successful establishment of a One World Control System.
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample So here we are, ladies and gentlemen. The message “sent from my iPod” might now offer a little jolt to anyone who is taking this seriously.

The Brit accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a rally was an "obsessed" Robot Wars fan from Dorking in Surrey, the Mirror can reveal.
Michael Sandford, 20, is facing 10 years in prison for allegedly attempting to kill the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in Las Vegas on Saturday.
He is charged with 'an act of violence on restricted grounds ' after allegedly attempting to grab a gun from a police officer's holster and shoot Mr Trump.
Sandford is believed to have told the Secret Service he had been “planning to kill Trump for about a year but decided to act on this occasion because he finally felt confident about trying it.”

The Mirror can reveal that until as recently as June 2014, Sandford was living with his mum Lynne in Dorking, Surrey.
He has been described as an "obsessed" fan of the TV show Robot Wars and had spent thousands of pounds buying robots from the show, despite having "no idea" how to operate them.
John Findlay, the expert behind the original show, told how he bought and sold robots to Sandford until he suddenly "disappeared".

Mr Findlay said: "I'm totally shocked. When I saw his picture it was just totally freaky.
"He went through a phase of buying a load of robots starting around five years ago, then he just disappeared.
"He was quite active in the robot community for a while - buying famous robots from the show.
"He was a bit obsessed.
"I then got them working for him because he had absolutely no idea about robots.
"I believe he had some form of autism - Robot Wars attracts quite a lot of people with autism.
"He was calm, very quiet, a little bit weird and reserved.
"That was it."
Mr Findlay said Sandford, a former pupil of The Ashcombe School in Dorking, suddenly got back in contact around June 2014 saying he needed to sell all his robots as soon as possible.
In a Facebook message Sandford wrote: "Sorry to bother you again Jonno, having a financial crisis, so if you can pay now all 3 are yours for £1500, I paid that for SA alone.
"Please let me know again don't mean to keep harassing you, but I'm sure you know what its' like having no money, Thanks"
Sandford's mum Lynne was seen being escorted out of a flat in Dorking today.
Lynne did not appear visibly upset as she walked away with the officers from Kent police but said nothing to waiting reporters and remained calm throughout.
A family friend said: "Lynne is devastated, she had no idea what had happened until she got a call from a friend who had seen it on TV.
"She has worked so hard to get her son through his problems and has another little one to take care of this will be far too much for her.
"She's switched off her phone and won't want anything to do with the world now she's just distraught.
"Her son always had very serious problems.
"He had a complete mental breakdown about six years ago and nobody has seen much of him since.
"He'd only come out at night because that's when he felt most safe I think but the family thought he was through the worst of his troubles.
"They thought he was on the mend out in the States so this is just absolutely shocking."
When Sandford appeared in court yesterday, it emerged he had been living in his car in the United States while on an expired Visa.
Prosecutors also said the suspect also suffered from a form of autism.

Following a brief hearing in Las Vegas he was ordered by US Magistrate Judge George Foley Jr. to be held without bail.
The justice found Sandford a danger to the community and a flight risk.
Assistant US Attorney Jared Grimmer argued for Sandford to remain on remand arguing he was unemployed and living in the States illegally with no ties to Las Vegas.
Mr Grimmer also said Sandford may have some “mental health issues.“
Police filed a complaint in the Nevada US District Court on Monday signed by Special Agent Joseph Hall.
He wrote how Sandford had driven from California in order to kill Trump and had visited a gun range in Las Vegas the day before to learn how to shoot.
On the day of the rally at the Treasure Island Casino the would-be killer is alleged to have approached a police officer on the pretence he wanted an autograph from Trump.
The report detailed how Sanford then tried grabbing the handle of the cop's handgun in an attempt to remove it.

“At the rally, uniformed Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officer Ameel Jacob was stationed at the rally to assist providing security,” said the report.
“An individual later identified as Sandford approached Officer Jacob, stating that he was seeing an autograph from Trump.
“Sandford then attempted to seize the sidearm Officer Jacob by grabbing the holster and handler of the firearm with both hands in an attempt to remove the firearm from the holster.
“Sandford was arrested and on his person was located a United Kingdom Driving Licence.”
The report then details how Sandford said he had been in the States approximately 18 months and had lived in Hoboken, New Jersey before moving to the “Ontario/San Bernardino” area of California.

He told the agent he had driven across the America in his black 2007 BMW 328i.
The report gave details of how the Brit had visited the Battlefield Vegas Gun range to learn how to use a gun.
“Sandford said he went to the Battlefield Vegas Gun range in Las Vegas on June 17, 2016, to learn how to shoot a gun,” it stated.
“Sandford claimed that this was his first time he had ever fired a gun.
“According to Sandford he fired 20 rounds from a 9mm Glock pistol for the purpose of learning how to use it.”

The man was later identified by staff at the gun range as having been there the day before to practice.
They recognised him by his UK driving licence which was shown to them.
The report said Sandford had “targeted Officer Jacobs because he believed he saw the officer's holster in an unlocked postion.
“Sandford reason it would be the easiest way to acquire a gun to shoot Trump.”
The Brit told the Secret Service “if he were on the street tomorrow, he would try this again”.
When asked what he would have done had he not made an attempt on Trump's life he said he had bought ticket a for Trump rally in Phoenix, Arizona, where he would try again.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are providing assistance following an arrest of a British national in Las Vegas."
Following his arrest his mother told court researchers he had been treated for obsessive compulsive disorder and anorexia when he was younger, and that he once escaped a hospital in England.
Public defender Heather Fraley said Sandford appeared to be competent and hadn't been diagnosed with a mental illness but that has autism and previously attempted suicide.
Family and friends have identified the fan who was beaten in the parking lot of the Stadium after Friday's game.Eyewitness News has learned Alex Arredondo, 43, is a U.S. Marine veteran of Huntington Beach and a father of three.In earlier reports, Eyewitness News identified Arredondo as a current Los Angeles Police Department officer. Police later clarified that the victim is a former LAPD officer who separated from the department in 2012."There's no information in our investigation to indicate what this victim did as a former occupation has anything to do with the attack," said Anaheim police Lt. Bob Dunn.The beating was likely not motivated by team rivalry, and police say both the victim and the suspect were dressed in Angels gear.The victim was assaulted as he walked with a family member to their car after the Angels' playoff game against the Kansas City Royals around 10:30 p.m. Friday.The victim, a diehard Angels fan, was attacked for no apparent reason , Dunn said.Officers told Eyewitness News that Arredondo was unresponsive when they arrived. He was put on life support at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, where he was listed in critical condition. His condition was upgraded to serious but stable around midday Monday."We're hoping that as he continues to improve, we'll be able to speak with him about what happened," said Dunn.In an exclusive interview, a mother and daughter, who witnessed the beating, say the suspect struck without warning."It was a random attack, it looks like, there was no arguing, there was no yelling. It was all just really surprising," one 15-year-old witness said, who only wanted to be identified as Morgan."The guy ran up on him from behind," said Morgan's mother, Sandra. "No shouting, nothing, it was just really quick, 'boom, boom, boom,' and then the guy went down. He got him really good and then he ran off."Two other suspects allegedly ran off with him. The incident occurred so fast that Morgan and Sandra say they were unable to get a good look at the suspect.The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are cooperating with Anaheim police as they search for the suspects and an answer for the brutal attack.In a statement to Eyewitness News, the team said, "the safety and fan experience is the focus of our organization. It's an unfortunate incident. We wish the gentleman and his family the best. We hope that the investigation will unfold the way it should," adding that security is evaluated every night on a regular basis, and that, "that night, the response was immediate."Officers said alcohol played a role in the attack. They believe Arredondo and other people in the area were intoxicated at the time of the attack, which is making the investigation more difficult."Now we're trying to get the best and most accurate information we can, and that's proven to be difficult because of the intoxication of some of the people involved," said Dunn.Anaheim police are asking anyone who may have photos or videos from that night to contact them immediately.
With the upcoming Gore-a-thon set for September 14th, Gore needs an attention boost more than ever. And that's not all, the number of people that beleive the sun has a role is growing. 60% of likely U.S. Voters think it's at least somewhat likely that the level of activity on the sun, including solar flares and sunspots, has an impact on the long-term heating and cooling of the earth's atmosphere. Just 22% feel that it's unlikely solar activity influences the atmosphere's long-term temperature.
From Rasmussen reports:
The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey of Likely Voters shows that just 24% of voters consider Gore an expert on global warming. Fifty-nine percent (59%) do not think Gore is an expert on the subject, an increase in skepticism of 12 points since March 2007. Another 18% are not sure. (To see survey question wording, click here.)
While a plurality of Democrats (43%) considers Gore an expert on global warming, most Republicans (80%) and voters not affiliated with either major political party (65%) disagree.
Gore may disagree, but most voters believe solar activity has an impact on global cooling and warming. A narrow plurality gives human activity the edge over sun activity, though, when it comes to which one has a bigger impact on the problem.
Gore is viewed at least somewhat favorably by 40% of voters, with 14% holding a Very Favorable opinion of him. Fifty-three percent (53%) regard him at least somewhat unfavorably, including 38% with a Very Unfavorable view.
That's some bad chakra. Even serial wailer Bill McKibben's message on “weather is climate, it really is, especially when there's a hurricane” is falling out of favor too:
With hurricane season in full swing, 41% of American Adults believe global warming is creating climate changes that lead to more extreme weather events. But that's down 14 points from June 2008 when 55% felt that way. Forty-three percent (43%) disagree and say global warming is not producing more extreme weather.

After a slow start following his return from injury, Iman Shumpert has made significant improvements for the New York Knicks over the course of the season and is bringing his best now that he's made it to the playoffs.
Shump had a fantastic rookie season—especially considering the expectations going in—but it was cut short early in the first round when he blew out his ACL. A year later, the guard is making up for the time he missed in his playoff debut.
Through the first eight games of the postseason, Shumpert is averaging 10 points, 6.4 rebounds and 1.5 steals, all of which are up on his regular-season numbers. On top of that, he's shooting an efficient 47 percent from the field, up from 40 percent.
One of the most impressive things about Shumpert is the way he's shooting from downtown. He worked on his shooting motion a lot while he was out and is now shooting 46 percent from behind the arc. And it's not just a fluke either, as he even shot 40 percent in the regular season.
With Carmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler and J.R. Smith struggling at times, Shumpert was one of the keys in getting past the Boston Celtics in the first round.
His biggest moment in the series came in Game 6, where he scored 17 points while also playing his typical elite defense. The Celtics threatened to come back with a 20-0 run in the fourth quarter, but Shumpert put a stop to that with a timely steal and fast-break finish.
That wasn't the only timely play Shumpert has made in the postseason. He's made a couple of game-changing putback dunks, and his defense is always up to scratch when it matters most.
Shumpert was already considered a huge part of the Knicks' future, and he's showing us once again just how much potential he has.
A few weeks after his return, there were rumors that New York considered swapping Shumpert for Jared Dudley of the Phoenix Suns, but his play thus far has done enough to ensure the rumors won't resurface in the summer.
Shumpert simply has too much talent and youth to be given away without receiving another elite prospect in return.
That doesn't even take into account how important Shumpert is to team chemistry. He leads the pregame huddle, is one of the most active cheerleaders on the bench and helps ball movement as a former point guard playing at small forward.
Much has been made of the Knicks' old age this season, but having Shumpert gives them some much-needed energy and a chance to improve from within with limited resources to add players in free agency.
With Smith likely hitting the open market in the summer, there's a chance he could be lured out of New York with a big contract. If that happens, Shumpert is going to be even more important and tasked with replacing the huge scoring load Smith will leave behind.
Either way, this is a player with a bright future, and with Mike Woodson and Jason Kidd behind him, he has unlimited potential.
Shumpert has the athleticism, talent, drive and understanding of the game to make a name for himself in the NBA, and we're starting to see it come together in these playoffs.
Berbera Airport (IATA: BBO[1], ICAO: HCMI) is an airport in Berbera, a city in the northwestern Saahil province in Somaliland. A new terminal and 12 km fence were built in 2015.
History [ edit ]
The Berbera airport has a 4,140 m (13,582 ft) runway, one of the longest on the continent.[2] The runway was built by the Soviet Union (USSR) in the mid-1970s in order to counter the United States' military presence in the region.[3] It was rented by NASA at a cost of $40 million USD per year, and used as an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle from 1980 until 1991, when the government of former President of Somalia Siad Barre collapsed.
In 2012, Somaliland's Ministry of Civil Aviation contracted the Tekleberhan Ambaye Construction Plc (TACON) to build a new terminal and perimeter fence at the Berbera airport. The Grade 1 firm had previously constructed various buildings in Ethiopia, including the Oromia region president's office, the Yayu fertilizer factory, Jimma University, Mekelle University and Gambella Region Technical and Vocational Training College. A joint venture with the Afro-Sino Contracting and Investment Company, the project's design was conceived by the International Consultants Technocrats and Marco Construction firms. It cost 83 million Ethiopian birrs in total, 3 million birrs of which was earmarked for TACON. In March 2015, President of Somaliland Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud officially inaugurated the new airport terminal and fence, with officials from Djibouti, Ethiopia and Yemen in attendance. The terminal was constructed on a 3,200-square metre land plot and has various facilities, including public address and communication equipment, baggage transfer and checkpoints, security checks, a water tanker, 200 kg capacity scales, and an asphalt road leading toward the runway. The airport fence is also 12 kilometres in length.[4]

OffGridBox — Bringing Clean Water and Power to a Billion People
Adam Wasserzug Blocked Unblock Follow Oct 3, 2017
Introduction
OffGridBox is a startup based out of Italy, with a US headquarters in Boston, that is taking on the challenge of bringing clean water and energy to the rural regions of developing countries around the world. According to the United Nations, 1.8 billion people are lacking access to clean water, and 1.2 billion are lacking access to basic electricity. OffGridBox's solution is — you guessed it — a box, that can be deployed off-grid.
The founder and CEO of the company is Emiliano Cecchini, who has a PhD in Chemistry, and has launched three companies in the renewable energy sector. He demonstrated his personal charisma and the ability to market his brand at Techstars Boston Demo Day 2017, but is that enough to make his business work?
The Product
The box looks a bit like something you might find in a hobbyist's garage, a 6x6x6 foot storage container with a solar panel array mounted on top. The OffGridBox collects rainwater in a large integrated polyethylene tank. The solar array and built-in inverter produce power from the sun, some of which is used to power an internal water sterilization and filtration system. The rest of the power can be stored in the equipped internal battery, or used externally for other electricity needs. Additional solar panels, batteries and/or a water desalination system can be added to expand the capabilities of the system.
https://www.offgridbox.com/product-1
The company currently has 28 boxes deployed, across 8 countries, although more than half of these are in Italy and the United States.
The main innovation and factor for the company's success will not be in its technology. Similar to how SolarCity used innovation in financing to become the largest residential solar installer in the U.S., OffGridBox will have to take advantage of new trends to implement a business model that will work and scale in rural locations. As PwC explains in its publication “Electricity Beyond the Grid”:
“For the millions of people who don't currently have access to electricity, the old assumption that they will have to wait for grid extensions is being turned on its head by new technological possibilities. Mobile payment infrastructure, customer-driven affordable payment systems and new entrant business models are all playing a part in a new bottom-up energy access that can complement the traditional top-down planning of national grid extensions.”
Similar to how Africa skipped the landline phase of telecommunications and went directly to widespread use of mobile phones, the development of electricity and water infrastructure will also develop in a decentralized way. Innovative platforms for making payments via mobile are commonly used in many African countries. On top of this, rural families are often accustomed to paying a lot of money for (sometimes dirty) water and for access to expensive diesel-powered electricity or kerosene-fueled lighting. There is a solid business case based on cost for replacing diesel, and the payment platform is already there.
Competition
There are other companies in this space, such as the Tanzania-based Off Grid Electric (backed by investors such as SolarCity and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen), and even large solar players such as SunEdison are considering a direct involvement in this space. In my opinion there is room for everyone at this point, it is not a zero-sum or winner takes all situation. Bringing clean water and energy to new regions will take a tremendous amount of resources, getting people out into the field, partnering with local governments and businesses, and catering the solution to the particulars of each locale. There will be competition for grants and other sources of funding, but there is plenty of room for OffGridBox, at least for now.
From a brief look at their product, I do not see anything that competition cannot replicate. The way OffGridBox can build a strong position will be to lock in contracts with governments and sources of funding, such as the World Bank, and execute its projects well. Developing a strong track record will put the company in a favorable position over new entrants as it aims to expand.
Key Risks
Finding the right business model and financing mechanisms will be key. While in developed markets such as the United States, investors are accustomed to pumping capital into companies that might lose $708 million per quarter, with the hope of some day cashing in on huge margins after the product has scaled to millions of users. Investors seem willing to subsidize a $3 UberPOOL ride now, because one day the company will become profitable and money from all these customers will come pouring in (unless you're Twitter). In undeveloped and unproven markets such as Rwanda (a focus for OffGridBox), such capital expenditures may never bear any economic fruit.
Nevertheless, OffGridBox did manage to lock in $705,000 in angel funding which closed in August 2017, including $620,000 from the Boston-based accelerator Techstars. In addition, the fact that the company is operating in international development means it could qualify for funding from institutions such as USAID, the World Bank, the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others. Off Grid Electric, for example, received $5 million from USAID's Development Innovation Ventures program. In July 2017, the World Bank and government of Rwanda announced a deal for the country's government to receive $49.8 million to increase access to electricity through off-grid renewable energy.
OffGridBox has a 100%-owned Italian subsidiary Exergy which I will assume is primarily responsible for developing the technology. The OffGridBox website lists seven Exergy employees. According to The Local the average salary for entry-level workers in Italy is about $32,000 per year. While these employees are experienced engineers, managers, etc., they are working in a field that is not known for being well compensated (international development). Therefore I think a safe assumption would be each employee costs the company about $50,000 / year total. Let's round up to $30,000 / month in costs for the seven-person Italian team. The US team comprises four, including two founders. We don't know if the founders are taking a salary, but let's assume an average salary of $70,000 for these four. Rounding up a bit, we get $25,000 / month.
With $705,000 of funding and $75,000 monthly overhead, the company would appear to have just secured about 9–10 months of runway. We can assume the company is almost out of cash from the $100,000 seed contribution from Right Side Capital Management in February 2017. This estimate of runway is generous, considering the material cost that goes into each OffGridBox. The company states that the initial cost of each box is $20,000, let's hope that includes their overhead and labor. Accounting for material costs of producing some new units, I would say they have six months to focus on promoting their product and the success of their pilot projects, with the end goal of landing an agreement for international development funds to support the manufacturing scale-up.
Revenue Model
As mentioned above, the company's cost for each box is about $20,000. The company expects to receive $10,000 in annual recurring revenue, so the break-even point on each box would be two years. Not bad.
https://angel.co/offgridbox
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that 50–100 liters per person per day are required for basic needs. The claim that one OffGridBox can provide water for 232 families (1150) is enormously exaggerated. Six gallons per family of five translates to about 4.5 liters of clean water per person. This is one-tenth of the absolute minimum dictated by the WHO. The system also depends on catching rainwater and is limited by tank capacity. It can be a great supplement to a family's water needs, but I do not see it being deployed as a comprehensive solution to water access.
https://angel.co/offgridbox
Recommendation
The company's participation in and backing from Techstars seems to have been a positive experience. The CEO's presentation at the Demo Day emphasized the importance their business model. At this point, I would not be ready to invest from a purely economic standpoint. I want to first see a strong government partnership and/or backing from international development funds. However, this company could be a great opportunity to demonstrate the potential of equity crowdfunding from non-accredited investors via a platform like Indiegogo or SeedInvest. A non-accredited investor might be more willing to invest $200 knowing that at worst, it went to a good cause. A VC may not feel the same way about $1 million. OffGridBox could also utilize microfinancing solutions such as TALA to empower the local entrepreneurs to invest in an OffGridBox to sell water and electricity to their community. If OffGridBox can think outside the box, they may very well be able to hack clean energy and water access for the billion people who need it!.

Jose Reyes went from a team battling for first place to one that's entrenched in the cellar, and the shortstop is already thinking about his next landing spot.
The All-Star shortstop, who was acquired by the Colorado Rockies in the trade that sent Troy Tulowitzki to the Toronto Blue Jays, said Saturday that he'd welcome a trade from Colorado. Reyes, 32, is owed $56 million through 2017, so the rebuilding Rockies likely are seeking the same.
"I'm at the point in my career that I want to win," Reyes told the Denver Post. "I say it over and over. I want to win. I don't want to spend the rest of my career on a last-place team. That's not the kind of player I feel like I am."
Jose Reyes hopes to soon be playing again for a contender and not buried in last place with the Rockies. Jim McIsaac/Getty Images
Reyes reportedly has cleared waivers, so the Rockies could trade him before the Aug. 31 deadline. If not, they might revisit trade talks this offseason.
The Rockies, at 49-72 entering Sunday's game against the Mets, are on pace for a second straight season of at least 90 losses, and it might be several years before they are competitive again.
"We'll see what happens here," Reyes told the Post. "But in the next couple years, I don't want to waste my time like that."
Reyes, a career .291 hitter, has a .282 average this season with six home runs, 41 RBIs and 19 stolen bases in 25 attempts.
Viewers who put themselves through 90 minutes of adrenaline-pumping terror can use up as much as 113 calories, close to the amount burned during a half-hour walk and the equivalent to a chocolate bar.
The movie top of the list of calorie-burners was found to be the 1980 psychological thriller The Shining, with the average viewer using up a whopping 184 calories.
Jaws took the runner-up spot, with viewers burning on average 161 calories, and The Exorcist came third, with 158 calories.
The University of Westminster study measured the total energy expenditure of ten different people as they watched a selection of frightening movies.
Scientists recorded their heart rate, oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output - and discovered the number of calories used increased by on average a third during the films.
The research also revealed films featuring moments designed to make viewers jump in terror are the best calorie-burners, as they cause heart rates to soar.
Dr Richard Mackenzie, senior lecturer and specialist in cell metabolism and physiology at the University of Westminster, said: "Each of the ten films tested set pulses racing, sparking an increase in the heart rate of the case studies.
"As the pulse quickens and blood pumps around the body faster, the body experiences a surge in adrenaline.
"It is this release of fast acting adrenaline, produced during short bursts of intense stress (or in this case, brought on by fear), which is known to lower the appetite, increase the Basal Metabolic Rate and ultimately burn a higher level of calories."
Helen Cowley, editor of the movie rental company LOVEFiLM - which commissioned the University of Westminster study - said: "We all know the feeling of wanting to hide behind the sofa or grab a pillow when watching scary or hair raising scenes, but this research suggests that maybe those seeking to burn some calories should keep their eyes on the screen."
The top 10 calorie-burning frightening films were:
1. The Shining: 184 calories
2. Jaws: 161 calories
3. The Exorcist: 158 calories
4. Alien: 152 calories
5. Saw: 133 calories
6. A Nightmare on Elm Street: 118 calories
7. Paranormal Activity: 111 calories
8. The Blair Witch Project: 105 calories
9. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: 107 calories

Rolls-Royce Corp. will house an research and development team for its jet engine component research in a 40,000-square-foot facility in the Purdue Research Park aerospace district. Rolls-Royce is the first to take flight in the district, which was announced this summer. (Photo: Provided)
Purdue Research Foundation's first development in its new aerospace district will house a research and development team from Rolls-Royce, officials announced Wednesday.
PRF unveiled plans to build a 44,000-square-foot facility where Rolls-Royce will develop and test jet engines, collaborate with Purdue researchers and create a pipeline for graduates to employment opportunities within the company, said Danny Warner, a company executive.
"I've spent a lot of the last few years coming back and forth to try to look at opportunities between Purdue and Rolls-Royce or just to pay back a little bit of what Purdue gave me," said Warner, who holds two degrees from the university. "The opportunity to become the first business that's identified with the new aerospace park is really exciting."
Rolls-Royce occupies no other such facility within the United States, Warner noted.
The company will occupy a majority of the building. Remaining space will be available for companies wishing to follow Rolls-Royce's lead, said PRF President Dan Hasler, who oversees tech parks already in operation in West Lafayette, Merrillville, New Albany and Indianapolis.
"I don't necessarily want to have Rolls be the 100 percent occupant of the building," he said, "because I want to have other spaces so when other companies come and want to have a relationship with Purdue, I have a place for them to sit."
How much PRF will pay to build the facility is still unclear, but the number of jobs Rolls-Royce will bring to the area is expected to be marginal.

"As for 'job creation' — there will not be any associated directly from Rolls-Royce. We will have staff visiting the campus on a regular basis, dependent on the types of research that will take place here," Joel Reuter, vice president of communications and marketing services for Rolls-Royce, said via email. "We mostly see this as an opportunity to work closely with students to fill our pipeline of talent when positions become open in our company."
Purdue announced its plans in April to create a 980-acre tech park west of campus, encompassing Purdue Airport, Purdue Aviation and Maurice Zucrow Laboratories. Less than two months later, Chandler Poole, West Lafayette's director of development, told the Journal & Courier that Rolls-Royce was considering an investment in the park.
The facility will lie within the bounds of the "certified technology park," a designation similar to a tax-increment finance district where tax revenues can be invested back into the community, Mayor John Dennis said.
Perhaps more important is the opportunity to slow the "brain drain," as graduates pursue opportunities outside the city and state.
"It's an excellent opportunity for students to do some research theory," he said, "to basically get a degree and for the interim to have opportunities for employment."
The benefits of the partnership will trickle down to undergraduate students, who will be able to directly apply what they learn in the classroom, said Gary Bertoline, dean of the Purdue Polytechnic Institute.
"This will be more dedicated to aviation research and that's key," he said. "Whenever you have a dedicated space where you can have faculty, staff and students work on a regular basis, great things will happen."

Malcolm Gladwell called in to the latest Bill Simmons Podcast. He and Bill covered a host of topics, including the Warriors' reinvention of the basketball wheel, the expanding pool of NBA stars, and Kevin Durant's next destination. In the transcribed portion below, Bill tells Gladwell about LeBron James's ridiculous training regimen. To listen to the whole episode and catch up with all Bill Simmons Podcast episodes, click here.
This transcript has been lightly condensed and edited.
Bill Simmons: I just, by chance, spent some time with Maverick Carter a couple weeks ago, who's LeBron's business partner, and we've had kind of a love-hate relationship. He feels that way. I've never really felt that way, but I think that he feels like we have a love-hate relationship because he always brings it up.
I asked him, “What's the biggest misconception about LeBron? What's the one thing people don't realize about LeBron?” And he said, “People don't realize how hard he works on his body.”
I'm like, “What do you mean?”
“LeBron spends like a million and a half dollars a year on his body.”
“What does that mean?”
And he's like, “Well, he's replicated the gym that whatever team — whether it was Miami or Cleveland — he's replicated all the equipment they have in the team's gym in his house. He has two trainers. Everywhere he goes, he has a trainer with him.” I'm paraphrasing what he told me, so I might not be getting all these facts right. He's got chefs. He has all the science of how to sleep. All these different things. Masseuses. Everything he does in his life is constructed to have him play basketball and to stay on the court and to be as healthy as possible and to absorb punishment when he goes into the basket and he gets crushed by people.
Now think about what an advantage that is compared to what the guys had 40 years ago when Dave Cowens just puts on his Converses, does a couple stretch, ducks some secondhand cigarette smoke … and then he rides coach. LeBron has just created this whole life to survive an NBA season and a playoff series. I don't think he's missed a playoff game. He's played 13 years. He never missed a playoff game. He's played like almost 200 playoff games.
Malcolm Gladwell: It is kind of unbelievable.
B.S.: The résumé he's putting together is unlike anything anyone's ever done. It really is. It has no parallel. Even someone like Kobe missed games and got hurt and had bad seasons and missed the playoffs and had years where he didn't even have to play a playoff game. LeBron's been in, at least, the second, third rounds, for 12 straight years [Update: It's 11 consecutive seasons]. He's always had to play eight months.
M.G.: Do you think he will ever win another title [this time in] Cleveland?
B.S.: I think Kevin Love will be the fall guy this year.
M.G.: What about Love for Melo? What's your take on that suggestion from The Ringer yesterday?
B.S.: I loved it. You know I love hypothetical fake trades. La La wears the pants in that family. She's not living in Cleveland. That's not happening. I don't think Carmelo goes anywhere. I think they like being in New York. I think he wants to be on the Knicks. I think Love going to Boston is more realistic, or maybe [he goes to] somebody who has the type of assets. I think LeBron gives this one more year, and if it doesn't work, I don't know. Remember, he picked all the players. He's the one who said $82 million for Tristan Thompson. They have the same agent. He was involved in that. They don't sign Iman Shumpert for 40 million bucks if he doesn't kind of nod his head. They're not putting together that team without soliciting his input. It's just not realistic. So, I don't know. I would say he comes back for one more year. I think Love's the fall guy … and I know nothing. I'm just talking out of my ass right now.
Hey there residents of Gloomhaven,
For the most part, fulfillment is continuing to run smoothly, but there are some issues regarding timing of shipments with Happyshops and FunAgain that I would like to briefly address.
EU/Rest of the World
I stated last week that we were almost done with sending these orders out, and if you didn't have a tracking number by now, you should contact us. But that was wrong. We were almost done a week ago, and today we're still... almost done.
What's going on is that, to the best of my knowledge, there are about 400 orders that just haven't moved in the last week. I wish I could tell you why, but I am still waiting on an explanation from Happyshops. But either way, if you're still waiting on your tracking info, it is likely that yours is one of these orders, and I ask that you be patient for a little while longer. The copies are there, so I'll do my best to convince Happyshops to send them out in a more expedient fashion.
I'll also post in the comments when I have a more thorough explanation for what is going on. I just wanted to update you now since this was the deadline I set last week.
US
We are also having some issues in the US in regards to speed of shipment. FunAgain received the brunt of the Kickstarter fulfillment for this project, and, well, this project is massive. Over 20,000 copies of the game were sent to their warehouse, and it is taking some time to get through them all. Compound that with the size of the box, and the fact that it is now December, and that FunAgain is fulfilling a different massive Kickstarter at the same time, and you get the idea.
They're doing the best they can, given the situation, so, again, I need to just ask you to please be patient. As far as I can tell, roughly 7,000 packages have yet to be sent out, so if you don't have it yet, or don't have your tracking info yet, please don't panic. And please don't email us or FunAgain asking when it will get shipped out. At this point, it is impossible to say, and neither I nor FunAgain is equipped to handle that sort of email traffic. It just slows everything down even more.
Other than that, all other information I have is in the previous update, and I'll be back next week with more news. Thanks for bearing with us!
The World Series of Poker will debut its real-money online poker site on Thursday morning. The poker site will be available only for those within Nevada's borders.
“It is a gratifying and exciting day to see the WSOP online launch,” WSOP Executive Director Ty Stewart said in a conference call Monday morning. “From Fremont to any street in Nevada in less than a decade.”
“We want to thank the Nevada Gaming Control Board,” the firm said about the extensive licensing and testing process. The WSOP had originally planned to launch a bit earlier this summer.
Nevada legalized online poker in 2011 and adopted online gaming regulations in December of that year. Earlier this year, the legislature acted to allow for state compacts in order to create greater liquidity for online poker sites. Nevada and New Jersey will likely partner in the future, with some in the industry predicting it coming sometime in 2014.
Liquidity, Mitch Garber, CEO of Caesars Interactive Entertainment, said, is a key to success for online poker. “We are very big supporters of shared liquidity. A small state like Nevada will benefit from shared liquidity. It is in everyone's interest to have compacts between states.” Nevada, however, he said will have a very healthy business on its own.
“This is a domino. This is the beginning of a very large online gaming business in America,” Garber said of what this crucial step means for Caesars and the industry at large.
As Bloomberg pointed out, Caesars Entertainment (CZR) stock has more than tripled this year.
So far, an offshoot of Station Casinos is the only Nevada gaming firm offering real-money online poker. Ultimate Poker launched this past spring and has been going strong.
Caesars Entertainment said it will look to be “the dominant” online poker provider in Nevada.
The firm said that it signed up 12,000 players during the WSOP in Las Vegas this summer. Live poker players were able to register in the Rio Hotel and Casino's sprawling convention center. Caesars offered perks for those who signed up then. However, that number pales in comparison to the 43 million people Caesars has in its Total Rewards database.
The WSOP's poker site will launch with Texas hold'em, in addition to other games like Omaha high and Omaha eight-or-better, seven-card stud high and seven-card stud eight-or-better.
The poker site will have a number of deposit methods to start. Players can deposit via Visa, MasterCard and ACH. Players will not be able to at Caesars' properties at launch.
The WSOP is also preparing for its own online poker championship series, but doesn't have any plans right now for awarding bracelets from web poker events. It will first use its real-money site to help players qualify for existing live tournament stops.
The software will be Windows and Mac compatible at launch.
There was some bad news for poker pros, however. The WSOP said it will not embrace the sponsored player model as seen in the past with many online poker rooms.
“GULF house”, says Dinesh Kumar every few seconds, gesturing out of the window of a car as it drives through Vennicode, in south-west India. His commentary is hardly necessary. The new houses, built with money sent home by people working in Dubai, Oman and other Gulf countries, flash like gold teeth in this backwater village surrounded by coconut palms. Vennicode has a brand new private school, too, as well as huge advertisements for jewellery shops and much more traffic than its narrow roads can handle. It is a tribute to emigration.
Last year India received $70 billion in remittances—more than any other country in the world. The state of Kerala, where Vennicode is located, got far more than its fair share. A comprehensive household survey organised by Irudaya Rajan of the Centre for Development Studies, a local academic institution, finds that 2.4m Keralites were living and working overseas in 2014. The money they send home is equivalent to fully 36% of the state's domestic product. “For all practical purposes, it's a remittance economy,” says C.P. John of the state government.

Economic migration has become so widespread that global remittances are now worth more than twice as much as foreign aid (see chart). Many countries depend on them: remittances are worth 10% of the Philippines' GDP and 42% of Tajikistan's. But Kerala has been hooked on remittances longer than most. It shows how they can reshape an economy.
The most obvious effect, evidenced by the fancy houses of Vennicode, is to make a place richer. Kerala was already one of the better-off states in India when mass migration to the Gulf began, in the 1970s. It is now about 50% wealthier per head than the national average. Migrants are disproportionately Muslim and well-educated; their families have done best. The poorest have mostly stayed put. Partly as a result, Kerala is now one of the most unequal states in India—rather embarrassingly, given its socialist political traditions.
Mr Rajan's survey shows that households are much more likely to own refrigerators and the like if a family member works abroad. Above all, though, remittances are spent on new homes. Saji Thomas of Heera, a construction firm, says that about 70% of his customers are emigrants or returned emigrants. Some move their ageing parents out of the countryside and into new high-rise flats close to good hospitals. Partly as a result, Kerala has become India's fastest-urbanising large state. In 2001, 74% of Keralites lived in rural areas. By 2011 the proportion had fallen to 52%.
Something similar is happening in Nepal, where remittances have risen quickly and now amount to 29% of the economy. The Kathmandu metropolitan area is growing by about 4% a year—faster than almost any other large city in South Asia. Even though agricultural wages are rising, rural Nepal is losing workers.
When money flows from abroad, people not surprisingly stop working back-breaking jobs. This shift is especially beneficial for children. During the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, the Philippine peso collapsed, increasing the value of remittances to that country. Dean Yang of the University of Michigan has shown that families responded by pulling their children out of jobs and sending them back to school. Girls benefited more than boys. Western Union, a giant money-transfer firm, reckons 30% of the money that flows through its system is spent on education.
As the supply of willing workers diminishes, wages rise. Mr Thomas reckons that construction costs in Kerala are 20-25% higher than elsewhere, mostly because labour is so expensive. This imbalance has encouraged a large internal migration. Many of Mr Thomas's builders are from Bengal and Orissa, in north-east India, though Keralites still do skilled jobs such as installing air conditioning.
It is oddly hard to work out how emigration affects a country's long-term economic prospects. Data are patchy: an apparent global surge in remittances since the 1990s is mostly the result of better reporting. And it is hard to separate cause from effect. When a country's economy slumps, emigrants might well send more money home, making it seem as though the payments have caused the problem.
In Kerala, some suspect that remittances have fostered complacency; at the least, they have opened an embarrassing gap between the state's wealth and the vigour of its businesses. Mr John looks enviously at nearby Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, with their factories and IT office parks, and asks why Kerala has been unable to provide more jobs for ambitious young people.
With its lovely climate and educated populace, Kerala might have created a leading university, but has not. Some believe there might be a future in medical tourism: perhaps Gulf Arabs have become so accustomed to Keralites that they will travel to the state for treatment.
Still, the biggest danger posed by remittances is that they may dry up. Gulf countries are always talking about pushing migrants out of skilled jobs to make way for natives. And Keralan migrants face rising competition from compatriots from the north and Nepalis, among others. The states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh now export more people, at least as measured by India's border authorities, though Kerala still sends a greater share of its population.
That might not be the end of it, though. Keralans are a coastal, outward-looking people, seemingly addicted to migration. They were pioneers in the Gulf and ought to be able to find new destinations with even better prospects. Mr John has a child in Britain; the promised land is America.
Online retail giant Amazon will no longer offer free shipping to what it calls “remote locations” in the Northwest Territories.
Some Amazon Prime customers in the NWT and Nunavut received a message from the company on Wednesday. Their Prime subscriptions are being refunded in full.
The message says that as of today, free shipping is no longer available “due to the economic and shipping complexities in remote locations”.
Customers in affected areas must now pay $29 per shipment, plus $22/kg per item on top of that, for shipping.
Hay River appears to be one of the communities affected, though Amazon has not produced a definitive list. Free shipping remained available in Yellowknife when we accessed Amazon's website on Wednesday morning.
‘$40 for diapers, $162 for shipping'
Hay River resident Adam Hill was one of the first to receive the message.
Hill immediately checked to see how the change had affected the shipping he would pay for Amazon items.
“I woke up this morning and got the notice,” Hill told Moose FM.
“As a new father, it's diapers or formula. Formula is the big one for us. We order it from the UK as they don't have any corn syrup in it there.
“I checked the date and, of course, they had cancelled it already – so you can't make any more orders, just in case.
“I looked up the cost of buying one more box of diapers. It would be $40 for the diapers… and $162 for shipping.”
Hill says even buying a $13 book now costs $50 for shipping with Amazon.
“I've already looked for other places online and, unfortunately, other online distributors don't offer free shipping to the NWT either,” he said.
“Northern local retailers will definitely see a benefit to this. In the past, there was such a huge price discrepancy between buying online and buying northern. I'm all for buying north, but you've got to watch the bottom line.
“I think you'll see a lot of people driving south again, too.
“Amazon have lost me as a customer.”
At the moment it's not clear where, exactly, Amazon's change in shipping policy applies. There is no definitive list of communities affected.
Amazon's updated policy on shipping to remote locations says “towns far from a shipper's hub, towns that are infrequently served by shippers, and Canada Post Air Stage locations” are affected, but does not specify individual communities.
Moose FM asked Amazon to clarify its policy and provide comment. The company refused an interview but issued this statement: “Our goal is to offer fast, affordable shipping to all of our customers and we are committed to exploring new delivery solutions that better serve customers in remote locations.”
The Huffington Post have discontinued their serial editor's note that branded Donald Trump a “racist”, “misogynist”, and a “xenophobe” at the end of every article about him, citing the need for a “clean slate.”
The editor's note had been used by the news outlet for much of Trump's presidential campaign, and claimed:
“Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S”
“The thinking is that (assuming he wins) that he's now president and we're going to start with a clean slate,” said the Huffington Post's Ryan Grim in a leaked memo reported on by Politico. “If he governs in a racist, misogynistic way, we reserve the right to add it back on. This would be giving respect to the office of the presidency which Trump and his backers never did.”
“This note was added to stories about presidential candidate Donald Trump during the election cycle,” said Huffington Post spokeswoman Sujata Mitra, who claims that the note is only being discontinued since Trump is no longer a candidate. “Now that the election is over, we will no longer be adding the note to future stories, as he is no longer a presidential candidate.”

In computer and video games, sequence breaking is the act of performing actions or obtaining items out of the intended linear order, or of skipping "required" actions or items entirely.[1] Sequence breaking is often used to beat a game unusually quickly, to beat it while only completing a few objectives or obtaining a few items, to obtain useful items early in the game, to make the game more difficult, or to help push a game as far as possible in some other way.
History of the term [ edit ]
Though sequence breaking as a concept has existed almost since the inception of computer games complex enough to have sequential storylines, apparently the first documented action in a video game to be called a sequence break occurred in the Nintendo GameCube game Metroid Prime, in a thread called "Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus".[2] In the game, the rock monster Thardus was designed to be a required boss before the Gravity Suit and the Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. When a gamer named Steven Banks achieved this feat on January 18, 2003, he posted his discovery on the Metroid Prime message board on GameFAQs. The thread attracted a number of interested gamers, and the term sequence breaking was incidentally coined.[3] The term has since grown in popularity and is now often applied to unintended shortcuts in any game.
The term has become so pervasive that it has begun appearing in video games itself,[note 1] and inspired by games such as Super Metroid, game designers may create their games with sequence breaking in mind.[4]

Abstract The United States has higher infant mortality than peer countries. In this paper, we combine microdata from the United States with similar data from four European countries to investigate this US infant mortality disadvantage. The US disadvantage persists after adjusting for potential differential reporting of births near the threshold of viability. While the importance of birth weight varies across comparison countries, relative to all comparison countries the United States has similar neonatal (<1 month) mortality but higher postneonatal (1–12 months) mortality. We document similar patterns across census divisions within the United States. The postneonatal mortality disadvantage is driven by poor birth outcomes among lower socioeconomic status individuals. (JEL I12, I14, I32, J14)

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at Savatthi, in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's Monastery. Then the Blessed One, early in the morning, put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. And Ven. Rahula, early in the morning, put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms following right behind the Blessed One.[1] Then the Blessed One, looking back at Rahula, addressed him: "Rahula, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.'"
"Just form, O Blessed One? Just form, O One Well-gone?"
"Form, Rahula, & feeling & perception & fabrications & consciousness."
Then the thought occurred to Ven. Rahula, "Who, having been exhorted face-to-face by the Blessed One, would go into the town for alms today?" So he turned back and sat down at the foot of a tree, folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, & setting mindfulness to the fore.
Ven. Sariputta saw Ven. Rahula sitting at the foot of a tree, his legs folded crosswise, his body held erect, & with mindfulness set to the fore. On seeing him, he said to him, "Rahula, develop the meditation[2] of mindfulness of in-&-out breathing. The meditation of mindfulness of in-&-out breathing, when developed & pursued, is of great fruit, of great benefit."
Then Ven. Rahula, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the Blessed One and, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to him, "How, lord, is mindfulness of in-&-out breathing to be developed & pursued so as to be of great fruit, of great benefit?"
"Rahula, {any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: 'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.' There are these five properties, Rahula. Which five? The earth property, the water property, the fire property, the wind property, & the space property.
"And what is the earth property? The earth property can be either internal or external. What is the internal earth property?}[3] Anything internal, within oneself, that's hard, solid, & sustained [by craving]: head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's hard, solid, and sustained: This is called the internal earth property. Now both the internal earth property & the external earth property are simply earth property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the earth property and makes the earth property fade from the mind.
"And what is the water property? The water property may be either internal or external. What is the internal water property? Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's water, watery, & sustained: bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, oil, saliva, mucus, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's water, watery, & sustained: This is called the internal water property. Now both the internal water property & the external water property are simply water property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the water property and makes the water property fade from the mind.
"And what is the fire property? The fire property may be either internal or external. What is the internal fire property? Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's fire, fiery, & sustained: that by which [the body] is warmed, aged, & consumed with fever; and that by which what is eaten, drunk, chewed, & savored gets properly digested; or anything else internal, within oneself, that's fire, fiery, & sustained: This is called the internal fire property. Now both the internal fire property & the external fire property are simply fire property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the fire property and makes the fire property fade from the mind.
"And what is the wind property? The wind property may be either internal or external. What is the internal wind property? Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's wind, windy, & sustained: up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the stomach, winds in the intestines, winds that course through the body, in-and-out breathing, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's wind, windy, & sustained: This is called the internal wind property. Now both the internal wind property & the external wind property are simply wind property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the wind property and makes the wind property fade from the mind.
"And what is the space property? The space property may be either internal or external. What is the internal space property? Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's space, spatial, & sustained: the holes of the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the [passage] whereby what is eaten, drunk, consumed, & tasted gets swallowed, and where it collects, and whereby it is excreted from below, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's space, spatial, & sustained: This is called the internal space property. Now both the internal space property & the external space property are simply space property. And that should be seen as it actually is present with right discernment: 'This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.' When one sees it thus as it actually is present with right discernment, one becomes disenchanted with the space property and makes the space property fade from the mind.

"There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and setting mindfulness to the fore.[4] Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.
"[1] Breathing in long, he discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long.' [2] Or breathing in short, he discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, he discerns, 'I am breathing out short.'

UPDATE: Missing Lancaster kids found safe in Franklin County.
ORIGINAL STORY:
Family members are pleading for information that will bring home safely.
Lancaster Police said they received a cell phone ping in south Columbus on Monday afternoon from one of the phones belonging to 17-year-old Mckaila Nicole Runyon or her cousins (13-year-old Neavah Sturgeon and 11-year-old Brayden Sturgeon).
All three were last seen in the 1100 block of South Broad Street in Lancaster around 11 p.m. Sunday night. They were reported missing at 1:30 p.m. on Monday afternoon.
Brayden and Neavah's grandmother Robyn Wright said the kids were living with their Aunt Cheryl in Lancaster, who woke up to find all three gone.
"I am about ready to have a heart attack," she said. "I just don't know, how do they think they are going to survive out there?"
Family and friends said the three have had a difficult life, but want them to come home now.
Police said they believe the teens are likely in a vehicle somewhere, or have access to transportation. As of this report, they think the group is still likely in Ohio based off of messages the kids sent to family and friends.
"Just come home. Anything can happen. Just come home," said Neavah and Brayden's Aunt, Layla Cortes.
Anyone with information is asked to call Lancaster Police at 740-687-6680 and press the #2 when prompted.
I want to nuke the North Pole.
Yes, really. Don't act surprised, I know you've thought about it, too. I mean, what else are we going to do with all of this stockpiled uranium and plutonium? We can't just let it go and decay now, can we? And what about all of these centrifuges? I like cotton candy as much as the next guy, but something tells me they're too unwieldy for a carnival. And these ICBMs? It would be a tragedy to waste them on lowly chemical or biological weapons. I for one will not settle for destruction-lite.
I want to nuke the North Pole.
You heard me right, and here's why: I'm tired of all this doomsday talk about global warming. Carbon dioxide this, climate change, that. Enough with the useless foreboding—let's get on with it, already! Honestly, how much longer d'you reckon we put up with scientists pontificating about what's to come “in the coming decades,” or “for future generations.” The apprehension is unbearable! The anxiety is crippling! And, perhaps most importantly, the suspense is killing me! Some estimates say that the full range of effects may not manifest themselves for hundreds of years. I'll be dead by then! And I'll be damned if I miss out on the spectacle. No more of this gradual sea level rise nonsense; let's melt the Arctic now, in one fell swoop! As the old adage goes, “Why put off ‘till tomorrow what you can annihilate today?”
I want to nuke the North Pole.
I didn't stutter. And don't start crying about Old Saint Nick. How I see it, expelling that corpulent bastard's workshop from the face of the Earth is an added bonus. What kind of person uses slave labor to produce low-quality consumer goods for a bunch of spoiled brats while hundreds of millions of children starve? How about flying that tacky-ass sleigh to Africa and giving Ogechukwukama some damn food, never mind a new Hot Wheels® set. I mean, It's clear the man likes to eat, so you'd think he'd have some sympathy, but no. And what a misogynist he is, keeping Mrs. Clause locked up in the house at all times, having her wait on him hand and foot, forcing her to cook him meal after gluttonous meal. And the poor elves, oh the poor elves. Ordered to work day in and day out for no pay, being constantly admonished, barely receiving enough sustenance to stave off exhaustion. It's unconscionable. Santa is a capitalist pig, a patriarch, and the quintessential white-man. It is therefore with relish that I await his atomically induced demise. As for the missus and the elves… Well, at least they'll be put out of their misery.
I want to nuke the North Pole.
And you should, too, if for no other reason than a change of scenery. Earth's poor capo has been covered in ice—and not much else—for 2.7 million years. That's a long f**king time! Don't get me wrong, ice is important and all; how else would I chill my raspberry lemonade on a sultry afternoon? But millennia after millennia of nothing but frozen dihydrogen monoxide has left me jaded. I'm ready for something new, something different. Besides, a thermonuclear explosion could be just what the doctor ordered. At last, our dream of exploring the hitherto unnavigable polar sea could become a reality. Perhaps some new wildlife will flock to the area, bringing much-needed biodiversity. Heck, we could even go swimming!

I know what you're thinking, comrades, that this is an impossible feat. But I'm here to tell you you're wrong. Did Hitler say that when he embarked on the Holocaust? No way! What about Bushy Jr., when he led an entire country to war under false pretenses? Not a chance. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has. Someone said that, I forget who. The point is, come join me and help usher in a new era of lofty seas and Santa-less skies. For more information, go to Ice-the-Ice.org.

The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.
I am increasingly of the opinion that the basis for the inflamed, visceral hatred of President Donald Trump in some quarters is neither his occasional vulgarity, nor his propensity to toss out "un-presidential" insults, nor the "misogyny" and "sexism" that the left pretends to see in his every word.
Rather, it's that his presidency has torn the veil off of the left's inexorable and -- until recently -- largely obscured march toward a socialist America. Trump has exposed and discredited many of the institutions and mechanisms the left uses to execute its fundamental transformation: the media, the entertainment industry and academia.
Furthermore, he is an unabashed capitalist, a walking manifestation of American achievement through commerce.
And for this, they despise him.
Health care is a pristine example of the battle being waged. Obamacare is collapsing. The GOP is too terrified to repeal it. Democrats know that its failure, particularly in the absence of legitimate free market alternatives, will virtually ensure the "single-payer" system they're now openly pushing.
Single-payer is a recipe for failure and abuse. (Exhibits 1 and 2: the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health Services.) Except in relatively small, largely homogenous populations, collectivism fails because in the absence of financial incentives, more people want to receive things than want to make or provide them. The government must therefore insert itself into every transaction: "You must make X." "You can only charge $Y." "You only get so much of Z."
Thus does single-payer health care morph from being a provision system to a rationing system. And those who control the rations control the people.
There is plenty historical evidence of socialism's disasters, most recently in Venezuela. Detractors will no doubt scoff: The Venezuelan government took over most private enterprise; there's no indication that such a thing would ever happen here.
However, socialist and communist regimes tend expand not because they succeed, but because they fail.
Those who espouse the glories of collectivism in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary are ideologues. And ideologues never accept defeat. Instead of admitting the collapse of a failing business model, the left's impulse is to take it larger: "We just need more money." "We need higher taxes." "We need the government to take control of more."
This produces larger, systemic failure, and more widespread misery. Then cometh the political oppression. To preserve the regime, it becomes necessary to silence anyone who complains or dares to point out the painfully obvious truth that these ideas destroy whatever systems they infect. Ordinary citizens starve. If they are entrepreneurs or industrialists, their businesses are stolen. Members of government are removed in fraudulent "elections," run out of town or arrested on trumped-up charges and imprisoned.
When no one in power will face reality, there are few options left, and they are almost always catastrophic: civil war, revolution, anarchy.
Failed policies. Collapsed economies. Political repression. The examples are so numerous as to strain credulity: Venezuela, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, North Korea, China, Cambodia, East Germany, Angola, Somalia, the former Soviet Union. Hellholes created under siren promises that government would provide everything for free.
So much suffering, and so avoidable.
But we're not supposed to know any of that. Our educational system is supposed to be indoctrinating children to think that capitalism is greed and collectivism is compassion. The media willingly conspires to keep us ignorant. (The New York Times is running a series that The Federalist author Robert Tracinski rightly decries as an effort to "rehabilitate Communism." Lenin and the Bolsheviks were "well-intentioned people trying to build a better world out of a crisis"? Little has changed since the days of Walter Duranty, apparently.) Millionaire entertainers dutifully spout politburo propaganda in exchange for escaping the accusations of hypocrisy that should accompany their sky-high incomes and royal lifestyles.
As middle-class voters are realizing, Democrats have been pushing their party in this direction for decades. Republicans (at least at the Congressional level) suck their thumbs and pretend it isn't happening, whilst falling for the "bipartisanship" ploy that makes them ineffectual fools even when -- as now -- they hold political power.
Donald Trump may not have intended to be the man who pulled down the curtain, but pull it he did. He has become the face of the opposition to the plans of the cultural elite. For that he must be destroyed.
Ultimately, however, the left's war isn't with Trump. It is with those of us who see socialism's failures, and who refuse to sit back and watch while our freedoms are dismantled and our country is destroyed.
A FISHERMAN has risked his life for what he considered a good cause - booze.
He won two cases of bourbon for jumping onto a log racing down a flooded, crocodile-infested river - in the nude, The Northern Territory News reports.
The tiler, who didn't want to be named, rode the makeshift raft for about three minutes before clambering back into a boat.
"I'd enjoyed a few beers and it seemed a good idea at the time," he said.
Witness Billy Innes said his mate thought nothing of the dangers of drowning or being eaten by a saltwater crocodile, which inhabit the river in large numbers.
"It was hilarious," he said.
The daredevil was camping at the Daly River on Sunday when he accepted the bet.
"Huge trees were hammering down the river," Mr Innes said.
"It was quite a sight. Someone dared him to get on to one of the logs and row across the river."
Keith Parry, 20, was killed while swimming across the Daly River in April 2009. He was crossing the river because he wanted more beer.

With flick of a zip, the plimsoll-type footwear change into open-toed sandals perfect for hot summer days.
Nat-2's new transforming shoe could help save time deciding what shoe to wear The Nat-2 design looks like a regular pair of canvas shoes, similar to popular designs by the Converse brand.
But when you want to give your feet a bit of fresh air you can unzip the sole to reveal a pair of sandals.
The canvas top can easily be folded up and slipped into a bag.
With more than 20 different designs available, you can mix and match soles with different uppers.
However, the Nat-2 are much harder to track down. The only place selling them in Britain is Wild Goose, in Twickenham, South-West London, where you can pick up a pair for £59.99.
The owner Peter Pearce, 63, said: "We were the first to bring these shoes into this country in June, this year.
"We ordered almost 50 pairs at first and they are well on the way to selling out. The concept of the shoes is absolutely fantastic - and perfect for the summer. You get two pairs of shoes in one. The designer is always looking at new styles.
"We're planning to speak to him in the next month about new designs. It's early days for us but we're confident the Nat-2 shoes are going to be a big hit."
A spokesman for the shoes' German designers K&T, said: 'Imagine being dressed properly and comfy wherever and whenever. The brand Nat-2 makes it possible by using its patented two in one system.
All tops are interchangeable which allows one to combine colours, materials and styles.
"By taking one base and various tops you can save weight and gain more space while travelling the world."
The Continental Towers in Enid, Oklahoma
Harold Glenn Hamm[2] (born December 11, 1945) is an American entrepreneur primarily involved in the oil and gas business who is best known for pioneering the development of the large shale oil resources of the Bakken formation.[3] As of January 2018, Hamm's net worth is estimated to be $14.2 billion, making him the 79th richest person in the United States[4]. Hamm's net worth peaked at $18.7 billion in September 2014, but decreased to $9.3 billion by 2015. In 2012, presidential candidate Mitt Romney named Hamm as his energy advisor[5] and thereafter Hamm made substantial monetary and advisory contributions to the election effort.
Early life [ edit ]
Hamm was born in Lexington, Oklahoma, the 13th and youngest child of Oklahoma cotton sharecroppers, Jane Elizabeth (née Sparks) and Leland Albert Hamm.[6][7]
Career [ edit ]
Hamm is a key player in Hiland Partners and Hiland Holdings[8] as well as the shale oil-exploration company Continental Resources, Oklahoma's fourth largest public company.[9][10] Continental Resources moved from the Continental Towers in Enid, Oklahoma, to Oklahoma City in 2012. Hamm was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 2011.[11]
Hamm worked his way up from pumping gas and repairing cars[12] to becoming CEO of his own billion-dollar company. As a young man, he went to work in the oil patch and in 1967 at the age of 21 he founded his own company, Continental Resources,[13] a company that was originally called Shelly Dean Oil Company, named for his two daughters.[14] Hamm and Continental Resources pioneered the development of the Bakken Oil Field in Montana and North Dakota using both horizontal drilled wells and Hydraulic fracturing. He became a billionaire and Continental Resources became a major oil producer.[3][15] Hamm was given honorary degrees from Northwestern Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma.[16]
The Harold Hamm Diabetes Center at the University of Oklahoma was named after Hamm, who has type 2 diabetes.[16] The Harold and Sue Ann Hamm Foundation donated 10 million dollars to create the center.[14]
Hamm is a member of the Global Leadership Council at Concordia College, Moorhead, Offutt School of Business.[17]
Hamm appeared on the cover of Forbes in May 2014 in a story entitled "Harold Hamm: The Billionaire Oilman Fueling America's Recovery".[18]
In January 2016, Hamm stated that Saudi Arabia's attempt to flood the crude market at a time of oversupply and concerns about weakening demand is not working, believing that oil prices will double by year-end 2016, as Shawn Baldwin, Chairman of alternative investment firm The AIA Group, concurred with these statements.[19]
Political involvement [ edit ]
Shortly after being named energy advisor to the Romney campaign in March 2012, Hamm donated $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future.[20] On the eve of the Republican National Convention, Hamm was credited in a report with being among oil and energy executives consulted in a plan to devolve permitting on Federal lands to the state where the land is located. Romney's proposal, which was launched the same week as two industry fundraisers netted $10 million for the campaign, was seen as going beyond roots in the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the sometimes controversial permitting policies of the George W. Bush Administration in the 2000s.[21]
On the third day of the 2016 Republican National Convention, held in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 20, while delivering a speech for the then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Hamm was critical of the Barack Obama administration's policies for the energy sector, citing the burden that federal regulations represented to American oil producers in an alleged attempt to drive gasoline prices soaring. In his speech, Harold Hamm also denounced the Iran nuclear deal struck by the U.S. Department of State in 2015, saying that it would improve that country's ability to export petroleum and enable Iranian development of the atomic bomb.[22] Hamm also spoke favourably of Trump's policies for the oil and gas industry, which he claimed, if they were implemented, would make Donald Trump the first President to guarantee America's "energy independence".[23] In that same month, it was revealed that Donald Trump was considering Harold Hamm for energy secretary in his administration.[24]
Seeking to dismiss quake scientists [ edit ]
On May 15, 2015, Bloomberg reported that Hamm told Larry Grillot (the dean of the University of Oklahoma Mewbourne College of Earth and Energy) that he wanted certain earthquake researchers from the university dismissed.[25] The scientists were involved in studying connections between oil and gas activity and the increase in the earthquake activities in the state.
Joe Wertz, reporter for StateImpact,[a] wrote that further examination of Hamm's e-mail to Dean Grillot revealed yet another kind of threat:
Hamm also expressed an interest in joining a search committee charged with finding a new director for the geological survey," according to Grillot's e-mail. And, the dean wrote," Hamm indicated that he would be 'visiting with Governor [Mary] Fallin on the topic of moving the OGS out of the University of Oklahoma.'[26]
Personal life [ edit ]
Hamm divorced his first wife, Judith Ann, in 1987. They had three children together.[6][27]
In April 1988, Hamm married Sue Ann Hamm (née Arnall) with whom he has two grown daughters, Jane and Hillary.[6] Sue Ann is an economist and lawyer.[28] She has had executive roles at Continental Resources. She filed for divorce on May 19, 2012,[6][29] while Harold has said that he separated from Sue Ann in 2005.[6] In 2014 Forbes reported that a ruling would allow the bulk of his ownership interest in Continental—and hence his net worth—to continue intact after the divorce.[18] However, in August 2014, CNN and several other media outlets reported that Hamm could face a world record divorce settlement, with up to half of his estimated $20 billion fortune potentially being on the line.[30][31] On November 10, 2014, an Oklahoma County judge found that Hamm should pay his second wife $995.5 million. According to an article published on January 7, 2015 by the Wall Street Journal, "She rejected a divorce settlement check in the amount of $974,790,317.77, stating it would jeopardize her appeal with Mr. Hamm." [32] On January 8, 2015, CNBC reported that Sue Ann Arnall had deposited the $975 million settlement check.[33]
Hamm lives in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.[34] He owns homes in Enid, Oklahoma and Nichols Hills, Oklahoma, among other places.[6][35]

The writer teased the death during a BBC One Facebook Live event following tonight's episode of the show after he was asked about the character's fate, saying: "Yes, that's it. She's a Cyberman from now on. She was killing people from the trailer. That's the way it is sometimes."
Actress Pearl Mackie, who was also taking part, said: "I mean, I'm quite an emotional person, so it was pretty emotional even just reading any of it and at the read through it was quite emotional because there are a lot of endings.
"I think that's the credit to Steven's writing that you can get that kind of emotion from it when you read it that you're supposed to get when you watch it."
The companion's fate has not yet been confirmed either way but it's not looking good for the canteen worker either way.
Bill Potts was killed off this evening after she was shot through the chest and turned into a Cyberman after getting captured by some sinister creatures.
The instalment ended with a Cyberman from Mondas angrily walking towards the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) as it was revealed that Bill was inside the suit of the homicidal robot.
Former President Bill Clinton says he had “serious reservations” about covertly listening to phone conversations or reading emails of other world leaders during his time in the Oval Office.
“Well, it depended on who they were,” Clinton told Jorge Ramos on Tuesday. “If we thought they were engaged in hostile acts against the United States…then [American agencies] might do it. But — I'm not sure — we didn't have the capability then to do a lot of what's being done today.”
Since June, several media outlets have published leaked information about the broad spying powers wielded by the National Security Agency (NSA) under the aegis of President Obama. The agency has collected nearly all U.S. call records and captured millions of email contact lists.
The NSA also spied on at least 35 world leaders, including allies in Mexico, Brazil and Germany. That has led to rebukes from officials like Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., who said the data collection was “unacceptable.”
Clinton said on Tuesday that the spying scandal has hurt U.S. relations around the globe.
“I do think that the stories about the data collection has had a damaging effect,” he said. “And not just in Latin America, but in Europe and Asia. Now, it's interesting because in some other countries it's come out that those governments were doing the same thing, or that other governments had given us permission.”
Speaking with Ramos at his home in Chappaqua, New York, Clinton called for a more robust public debate on how to balance privacy and security concerns.
“What we need here is more transparency and more privacy and more security,” he said. “We're getting in a position here where people didn't know what was going on. And the way the data's been handled, it's not clear that it's maximized our security, and it's perfectly clear that it's eroded some people's sense of privacy. So I think the most important thing we can do now is have a really public discussion about what the rules should be.”
Clinton also called for more clarity between nations in how they proceed with intelligence gathering.
“I think there ought to be very explicit rules on listening in on conversations of world leaders,” he said.
On December 8, Clinton will convene regional and global leaders in Rio de Janeiro to discuss policy issues as part of the Clinton Global Initiative, a project he started in 2005.
"Girls" creator Lena Dunham has shown her support for Kesha in an essay for Lenny Letter.
"When a woman is not in control of her financial destiny, either because her partner is the primary breadwinner or because he makes financial decisions for the entire family, her world is made minuscule," Dunham wrote. "Her resources evaporate. Fear dominates."
As part of her feminist newsletter and site "Lenny Letter" , the "Girls" creator wrote in a Lenny Letter released today that "Sony could make this go away." Instead, the company chose to minimize Kesha to her music and albums with no acknowledgement of the "worth of her soul," Dunham wrote. By controlling her work, Sony also has a say in Kesha's finances. Aside from physical or verbal abuse, many domestic violence survivors face having little or no access to their finances at the hands of their partners , as Dunham pointed out.
On Feb. 19, a judge denied Kesha's request to be released from her contract with Sony after she said producer Dr. Luke sexually, physically and emotionally abused her. Since then, celebrities have stood by the "TikTok" singer online, including Lena Dunham who has shown her support in a powerful essay.
Dunham also applauded the fans and Dunham also applauded the fans and performers who have stood by Kesha , especially other women. She noted that "it wasn't that long ago" that women felt like they couldn't speak up for one another, "for fear of losing all they had worked so hard to create."
Those days are over. They are fucking done. We are not scared anymore of losing what we worked for, of being branded hysterical or difficult, of being targeted and silenced by men in power. The women in the music industry speaking out for Kesha are proof.
While her essay focuses on Kesha, Dunham wrote that the pop star's case is about much more than her career as an artist. Then in a single sentence, Dunham summed up the real message the outcome of Kesha's case reveals.
"What's happening to Kesha highlights the way that the American legal system continues to hurt women by failing to protect them from the men they identify as their abusers."

(AP) INDIANAPOLIS - A homeowner, her boyfriend and the boyfriend's brother have been charged with murder in connection with a house explosion in Indianapolis that killed two people, destroyed five homes and damaged dozens more, a prosecutor said Friday.
Monserrate Shirley, Mark Leonard and Bob Leonard were arrested Friday and charged with felony murder in the Nov. 10 blast, Marion County prosecutor Terry Curry said at a news conference in Indianapolis. John Dion Longworth, 34, and his 36-year-old wife Jennifer Longworth, died in the explosion.
The blast destroyed five houses including the Longworths' home located next door to Shirley's home in the Richmond Hill subdivision on the city's far south side. The late-night explosion, which was heard from miles away, damaged about 90 more homes and sent residents fleeing, some in their pajamas.
Officials ordered the demolition of about three dozen of the mostly heavily damaged homes and say the blast caused an estimated $4.4 million in damage.
On Nov. 19, authorities launched a homicide investigation into the blast after city arson investigators, along with agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, concluded it was not an accident.
Officials said they believed the explosion was intentional and caused by natural gas, but released no other details. Federal authorities are offering a $10,000 reward for information in the case.
Attorney Randall Cables has said Shirley and Leonard were away at a southern Indiana casino when the explosion happened. Shirley's daughter was staying with a friend, and the family's cat was being boarded.
Shirley has said Leonard had replaced the thermostat and that the furnace was working. Cable has said the daughter told her mother she had smelled an odd odor in recent weeks, but they hadn't reported it.
John Longworth was an electronics expert and his wife was a second-grade teacher.
The Hubble Space Telescope has captured an image of a glittering star cluster, resembling an opulent diamond tapestry, that contains a collection of some of the brightest stars seen in our Milky Way galaxy.
The cluster, called Trumpler 14, is located 8,000 light-years away in the Carina Nebula, a huge star-formation region, NASA said. Since, the cluster is only 500,000 years old, it has one of the highest concentrations of massive, luminous stars in the entire Milky Way, the researchers said.

However, these blue-white stars are burning their hydrogen fuel so ferociously that they will explode as supernovae in just a few million years, they said. The combination of outflowing stellar "winds" and, ultimately, supernova blast waves will carve out cavities in nearby clouds of gas and dust.
These fireworks will kick-start the beginning of a new generation of stars in an ongoing cycle of star birth and death. The composite image of Trumpler 14 was made with data taken in 2005-2006 with Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys.
Blue, visible, and infrared broadband filters combine with filters that isolate hydrogen and nitrogen emission from the glowing gas surrounding the open cluster. Astronomers estimate that around 2,000 stars reside within Trumpler 14, ranging in size from less than one tenth to up to several tens of times the mass of the Sun.
The most prominent star in Trumpler 14 is the super-giant HD 93129Aa. It is one of the most brilliant and hottest stars in our entire galaxy.
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata has told investors that he believes that Super Mario 3D World will be the title to help turn around the Wii U's fortunes this Christmas. During the meeting Iwata admitted that titles such as Pikmin 3 and The Wonderful 101 hadn't been anywhere near as successful as the company initially thought they would be.
“With respect to Wii U, on the other hand, I remarked at the Financial Results Briefing held back in April that we would carefully work on its market penetration, but its sales have not yet picked up significantly since the summer launches of some key first-party titles.”
“There have been large intervals between the releases of key first-party titles, and given that there is little seasonable demand at the moment, we are not in a position where we can change the fate of the system with just one title.”
“Fortunately, the year-end sales season is an opportunity in which various members of the family are likely to take an interest in Nintendo's home consoles, so we will try to change the situation surrounding Wii U through our efforts for this year-end sales season.
“The key title that is going to drive this year's year-end sales season is Super Mario 3D World, the latest installment in the Super Mario series that is set to be released in November.
“I feel that the trailers we have released so far already provide consumers with a taste of the quality of the game, but this is indeed a compelling product that provides both single and multi-player gameplay to a wide range of consumers from novice to experienced players of Mario action games.”
“Except for its backward compatibility with existing Wii software and accessories, we have so far failed to make propositions worthy of Wii U's position as a successor to the Wii system. While it took more time than expected since the launch of Wii U, we are now ready to offer Wii Sports and Wii Fit for Wii U, two of the defining games for Wii, starting today.”

Let the recriminations begin! Actually, the health-care-failure finger-pointing got under way well before Friday, when Donald Trump and Paul Ryan cancelled a House vote on the American Health Care Act. A day earlier, aides to the President let it be known that he had come to regret going along with Ryan's idea of making health care his first legislative priority.
In the coming days and weeks, there will be more of this blame shifting, and, in truth, there is plenty of blame to go around. Ryan failed to unify the House Republican caucus. Trump's staff allowed him to endorse a bill that made a mockery of his campaign pledge to provide health insurance for everybody. And Trump himself blundered into a political fiasco, apparently believing he could win over recalcitrant Republican members of Congress simply by popping over to Capitol Hill.
But this is just politics. The larger lesson here is that conservatism failed and social democracy won. After seven years of fulminating against the Affordable Care Act and promising to replace it with a more free-market-oriented alternative, the House Republicans—who are in the vanguard of the modern conservative movement—failed to come up with a workable and politically viable proposal. Obamacare survived, and that shouldn't be so surprising. When it comes to health-care policy, there is no workable or politically viable conservative alternative.
Of course, that isn't how conservative lawmakers, pundits, and policy wonks will spin this. They will argue that Trump and Ryan betrayed free-market principles: if only they had proposed the outright repeal of Obamacare, and put forward a bill that genuinely liberated the health-care industry from federal intervention, everything would have worked out well. That will be the story—and it is a fairy tale.
The fact is that the health-care industry, which makes up about a sixth of the American economy, isn't like the market for apples or iPhones. For a number of reasons (which economists understand pretty well), it is riven with problems. Serious illnesses can be enormously costly to treat; people don't know when they will get ill; the buyers of health insurance know more about their health than the sellers; and insurers have a strong incentive to avoid providing their product to the sick people who need it the most.
Since the days of Otto von Bismarck, most developed countries have dealt with these problems by setting up a system in which the state provides medical insurance directly, or else mandates and subsidizes the purchase of private insurance, setting strict rules for what sorts of policies can be sold. Obamacare amounts to a hybrid model. It supplements employer-provided insurance, the traditional American way of obtaining health care, with a heavily regulated (and subsidized) individual insurance market and an expanded Medicaid system.
It is far from perfect. But, in combining mandates with subsidies, regulation, and access to a state-administered system for the poverty-stricken and low-paid, it is intellectually coherent. (Many of the problems it has encountered arose because the mandate to purchase insurance hasn't been effectively enforced, and not enough young and healthy individuals have signed up.) Since it leaves in place the basic structure of private insurance and private provision, Obamacare is also conservative. As is well known, parts of it resemble a proposal that the Heritage Foundation put forward in 1992.
Today's conservatives act as if they can simply wish away some of the problems that Obamacare was created to deal with. The original version of the American Health Care Act left in place many of the A.C.A.'s regulations but cut back the subsidies and gutted its Medicaid expansion. Had it been enacted, it would have led to higher premiums, at least in the short term, and a huge drop in coverage—twenty-four million people over ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. As these implications of the G.O.P. proposal became known to the public, the plan's approval rating fell and fell. In the end, according to a Quinnipiac poll, only nineteen per cent of Americans supported it.
The Freedom Caucus, a group of right-wing conservatives in the House, wanted a bill that stripped away more regulations, which they claimed would enable insurers to offer cheaper and more flexible plans. On the eve of the vote, Ryan agreed to change a clause defining the “essential health benefits” that insurers are required to provide if they sell policies on the Obamacare exchanges—benefits including maternity and mental-health services. But this change would have created two insurmountable problems.
Once insurers were able to craft individual policies without adhering to any list of required benefits, buyers would self-select. Young, healthy people would choose cheap, crappy policies, and older, sicker people would choose more comprehensive policies. Insurers, knowing this, would raise the prices of the good policies. “Worthless policies would get really cheap, but comprehensive policies would get astronomically expensive,” Mother Jones's Kevin Drum pointed out. “Virtually no one would be able to afford them.”
The other problem was political. Americans need maternity coverage, mental-health benefits, prescription drugs, pediatric services, lab tests, and the other things included on the list of essential health benefits. When moderate Republicans in places like New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania heard that these services might be eliminated under the amended legislation, they abandoned it in significant numbers. It was their desertion that ultimately killed the bill.
O.K., you might say: The American Health Care Act was a disaster, but what about all the other Republican health-care proposals that are out there? Maybe one of them provides a workable alternative to Obamacare. Let's briefly look at a few of them.
When he was in Congress, Tom Price, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who supported the A.H.C.A., put forward a bill of his own. But it was basically a less generous version of the bill that just died: in gutting Medicaid and strictly limiting federal funding for high-risk pools to insure sick people, it would surely lead to a big rise in the number of uninsured. Something similar applies to a bill put forward by Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.
There are a few other plans kicking around conservative think tanks, some of which, like Obamacare, tie the level of subsidies to income. But all of these plans have other serious problems. In eschewing purchasing mandates, they run into the issue of younger people being unlikely to sign up for coverage. In giving insurers more freedom to offer different plans and different pricing structures, they encourage self-selection and undermine the risk-pooling that is at the heart of successful insurance schemes. And in cutting federal support for Medicaid, they dismantle the element of Obamacare that has been the most successful at insuring more people at a reasonable cost.
Another Republican plan that may now attract some attention is the proposal put forward by Senators Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, and Susan Collins, of Maine. But, far from dismantling Obamacare, the Cassidy-Collins plan would allow big, populous states like New York and California to keep the current system in place, including the Medicaid expansion and the surtaxes on high earners. Red states that don't like Obamacare would be able to take federal money and design their own systems to provide basic, catastrophic coverage plans to everybody.
Because it retains so much of Obamacare, this proposal seems unlikely to receive majority support inside the G.O.P. In the coming weeks, Republicans in the Senate and the House will be trying anew to come up with an alternative that they can unite around, portray as a big break from the A.C.A., and sell to the American public. The lesson of the past few weeks is that they are likely to fail. As a novice to the subject noted recently, health care is complicated. Too complicated for ad-hoc policymaking and simplistic conservative nostrums.
Fox News had what can only be described as an insane argument with itself over whether or not President Obama had won Ohio, and the presidency.
The network seemed quite confident in its projections at first, but suddenly, pundit Karl Rove — who, as leader of a huge conservative Super PAC has something of an interest in the outcome of the race — began to pour cold water on the call.
Fox News' Chris Wallace then said that Gov. Mitt Romney's campaign is contesting the network's decision to call President Obama's re-election.
Wallace said:
"Well I have great respect for our decision desk, and I can see that they're very happy in Chicago, but I have to tell you that the Romney camp has real doubts by the call that has been made by us and by other networks. They do not believe that Ohio is in the Obama camp. I just got an email from a top Romney person. I asked, 'Do you agree with our call?' He said 'Not really. It's less than 20 percent of the vote still out in GOP areas.'"
Rove said it was "premature" and "early" to make any real decisions.
"So, maybe not so fast, folks!" Wallace said. There was a pained silence.
"Uh, thank you!" Bret Baier said. "That's awkward," Megyn Kelly added.
Baier then said that he would get someone from the network's election desk to explain why it had made the call. Kelly walked across the office, cameras trailing her, to speak with the number-crunchers.
The number-crunchers calmly repudiated Rove.
"We're actually quite comfortable with the call in Ohio," one of them said. Another said he was "99.9 percent" certain that the president had been re-elected.
"There just aren't enough Republican votes left for Mitt Romney to get there," a fellow decision desk member added.
Rove continued to contest the call. "They know the science!" Kelly responded, exasperatedly. It turned out that nobody was on Rove's side.
"They're not listening to Karl," Kelly said with some finality, as she went to a break.
The world reacted with stammering befuddlement.
Once again there's a job opening in the Trump administration, and once again Chris Christie's name has popped up in association with said opening.
Before now, Christie's name would have been more likely to come up as the subject of a federal investigation, not as a candidate to lead one. But alas, this is Trump's America where up is down, black is white, and failure is success.
If the latter holds true, Christie might actually be overqualified to head the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
Christie's name got thrown into the ring by the now ubiquitous "unnamed sources." Who these sources are who think a disgraced governor with a near-single digit approval rating and a penchant for ham-fisted political retribution would make a good candidate for FBI director remains to be seen.
If I were a betting man, I'd wager they were a big Springsteen fan with a penchant for expensive travel. Just a hunch.
The idea of a man like Christie having access to the nation's deepest darkest secrets should strike fear into the hearts of any citizen. It should especially worry you if you've spent the better part of the past eight-plus years ridiculing the governor on the pages of the state's largest newspaper.
I once drew the man as a Dallas Cowboy's cheerleader. He was wearing a crop top. It went viral! If he's named head of the FBI, I've got a one way ticket to a dog cage in Cuba. I can't live in Cuba. Forget waterboarding, the humidity is torture.

BlessU-2, which delivers blessings in five languages, is intended to trigger debate about the future of the church
Five hundred years after revolutionary printing presses spread news of Martin Luther's radical call for church reform across Europe, technology is again challenging religious tradition in the small German town of Wittenberg.
A robot priest that delivers blessings in five languages and beams light from its hands has been unveiled as part of an exhibition to mark the anniversary of the start of the Reformation, a Europe-wide religious, political and cultural upheaval sparked when Luther nailed his 95 theses to a church door in the town.
Robot monk to spread Buddhist wisdom to the digital generation Read more
Half a millennium later, the robot, called BlessU-2, is intended to trigger debate about the future of the church and the potential of artificial intelligence.
“We wanted people to consider if it is possible to be blessed by a machine, or if a human being is needed,” Stephan Krebs of the Protestant church in Hesse and Nassau, which is behind the initiative, told the Guardian.
The robot has a touchscreen chest, two arms and a head. For the past 10 days it has offered blessings in a choice of German, English, French, Spanish or Polish. Worshippers can choose between a male or female voice.
The robot raises its arms, flashes lights, recites a biblical verse and says: “God bless and protect you.” If requested, it will provide a printout of its words. A backup robot is available in case of breakdown.
“The idea is to provoke debate,” said Krebs. “People from the street are curious, amused and interested. They are really taken with it, and are very positive. But inside the church some people think we want to replace human pastors with machines. Those that are church-oriented are more critical.”
Krebs and his colleagues are collecting responses for further analysis but he did not anticipate robots presenting a solution to a Europe-wide shortage of priests. A robot “could never substitute for pastoral care”, he said. “We don't want to robotise our church work, but see if we can bring a theological perspective to a machine.”
The Wittenberg exhibition commemorates the anniversary of political and religious convulsions across Europe in the 16th century, resulting in the greatest schism in western Christianity and a string of religious wars.
Luther's theses, written in Latin, fundamentally challenged the authority and elitism of the Roman Catholic church.
BlessU-2 is not the first robot to penetrate the world of faith. Last year, a Buddhist temple on the edge of Beijing developed a robot monk that could chant mantras and and explain basic tenets of the religion.
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen has raised interest rates three times this year
The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.25%, the third rate rise in 2017.
The US central bank said the move, which was widely expected, underscores "solid" gains in the US economy.
Officials also boosted their economic forecasts, projecting 2.5% growth in GDP in 2017 and 2018, due in part to planned tax cuts.
The Fed said it anticipates three further increases in rates next year, unchanged from its previous forecast.
The decision to raise interest rates, raising the cost of borrowing, takes the Fed farther away from the ultra-low rates it put in place during the financial crisis to boost economic activity.
Sounder sleep
The Fed is targeting a range of 1.25% to 1.5% for its benchmark rate. But a majority of officials said they expect interest rates above 2% will be appropriate next year.
The shift in policy comes as the US economy gains strength.
US economic output has increased at an annual rate of more than 3% in recent quarters, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1% last month - the lowest rate since 2001.
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, who is stepping down from her post in February, said the economy, labour market and financial system have grown stronger under her watch.
"There's less to lose sleep about now than has been true for quite some time, so I feel good about the economic outlook," she said.
Tax cut impact
Ms Yellen said policymakers expect the economy to get a further lift from a package of tax cuts - one of President Trump's central campaign promises - and those expectations were factored in when they revised upwards their predictions for economic growth.
The Fed is now forecasting 2.5% GDP growth in 2018, compared to a forecast it made in September of 2.1%.
Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC World Service Economics Correspondent
While Congress and President Trump's Administration continue to wrangle over tax reform, the Fed had to judge what the final outcome of that political process would mean for the economy. Inevitably there is a lot of uncertainty in there but they have concluded that it would provide a boost over the next three years.
The Fed's policymakers expect somewhat stronger growth than they did in September. Janet Yellen said that reflected a view in the committee that the reforms would stimulate consumer spending and business investment.
But there has not been much change in what the Fed's policymakers think of the longer term prospects. The Fed publishes information showing the range of expectations that its policymakers have. The middle of that range for long term growth is unchanged at a rather modest 1.8%.
Despite the acceleration in growth, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee said they expect interest rate increases to remain gradual - in part, a sign of ongoing concerns that inflation has remained below the Fed's 2% target.
Ms Yellen said she continues to believe the lacklustre inflation growth is due to one-off factors, such as declines in costs for mobile phone plans.
But she said the Fed will continue to watch those numbers and "if necessary, re-think" what is determining them.
"There's work undone there," she said.

Although it's a new year, there is still way too much meat on the bone that the self-anointed anti-“street harassment” organization Hollaback! threw all of us back in late October. Their viral video presentation, “10 Hours Of Woman Walking In NYC” attempts to make the case that “street harassment” is a global pandemic – armies and armies of men catcalling and worse, kinda like a pickup version of World War Z or something.
Yea, that's the ticket.
Only problem was, that Hollaback! really stepped in it and blew their own foot off with an IED-sized turkey of a “case”.
By now, you all know the facts, but what the heck, let's do it one mo gin, shall we?
Fledgling actress Shoshona Roberts agrees to be Hollaback!'s guinea pig for their grand social experiment, dreamt up by a Madison Ave.-styled public relations guru, who as it turns out, has quite a colorful – pardon the pun – past in crafting marketing visions for other big-time clients. Although the claim is made that this outing took place over the course of ten hours of hidden camera footage, we get the ultra-condensed version – barely two minutes long – showing all the world to see the damning evidence of boys being boys.
To say the whole thing was anti-climatic, would be a serious understatement.
Aside from two arguably questionable fellows who seem to have other problems than trying to pick up chicks, the rest are everyday guys being polite. It was news to me to hear that merely saying “good morning” was tantamount to committing an act of sexual violence.
To make matters worse, the video deliberately focused on lower-class/working class Black men in Harlem, Black America's most famous neighborhood, and by their own admission, edited out all of the footage they claim to have of the rest of NYC's men supposedly acting a fool. Put that together with the lone guinea pig – Ms. Roberts – being a white woman, and one cannot help but harken back to a very dark, sordid and not-too-distant past, where Black men were targeted for daring to “holla” at a white woman.
Emmett Till just turned over in his grave.
Indeed, the entire video gives one the distinct impression that the only people Hollaback! seems to be looking out for, are the interests of white, urban, young, relatively attractive, middle/upper middle class women, against working and lower-class Black and Brown men.
Nor was this little fact lost on the general public – even diehard feminists like Hanna Rosin, couldn't help but to put the obvious on blast – and the fact that the video itself has been parodied seventy ways to Sunday (even the Dark Knight himself got in on the act) – just goes to show what Americans in their right mind think of the whole thing:
That it is all a bunch of bunk.
No, scratch that: it's all a bunch of racist, classist, elitist, snobbish, over-entitled-in-only-a-Ms. Ann-white woman-can-be, a bunch of bunk.
Not to be outdone, the Black Feminist Brigades, ever-envious of Ms. Ann dontcha know, pouted and stamped their feet, mewling about how they were left out (forgetting the fact, for like the umpteenth time, that Ms. Ann-type Feminists have made it so abundantly clear that they do NOT want Black women up in their causes). All the usual suspects – Feminista Jones, the Crunk Feminist Collective, and the gals over at For Harriet, hollered about how the Ms. Anns were sucking all the air outta the room and taking the focus off of Women of Color, who also supposedly labor under such odious “street harassment” and to a much higher degree than Rachel, Becky or Marsha do (although, if you notice, no Black Feminist outfit has dared to do their own version of “10 hours of walking in…” – things that make you go, hmm…). Moreover and to really add some spice to the pot, the Black Feminists charge Black men for making the discussion “about race” rather than about all the bad “street harassment” on the part of the Black and Brown men in the video. Of course, they leave out the part that it wasn't Brothas at large who made the discussion “about race” – Hollaback! did, by presenting their video in the way they did.
Let's be completely honest about things here:
If you're a nominally middle class, relatively young and at least passably attractive white woman in American life, you are literally, at the top of the mating market foodchain – that's not a Brotha from around the way saying that, that's the findings of umpteen surveys and studies and researches of as many online dating sites and services. saying that. In fact, of all the differing types of American women out there, the only one that poses any real competition for the aforementioned white woman, are Asian women – but we'll get to that particular topic another day.
Everyone knows that American women such as described above, got it real good. A case in point, which drives it all home, was the disappearance, roughly a decade ago, of one Natalie Holloway – remember that? The Earth had to stop spinning on its axis until she was found. She wasn't, but everyone was reminded, day and night, that Holloway was missing and that she had to be found. In fact, that same year saw another young lady go missing, and only until the threat of mass protests and marches did the media finally zero in on her as much as Holloway (Latoyia Figueroa, from right here in Philly).
So, when Hollaback! ran with their culturally inappropriate, tone deaf and stompdown racist screed in the form of a YouTube video ran, people were only too quick to mock it for the squealings of entitled Ms. Anns that it was. Nobody was buying it, not even a goodly number of women themselves(!).
But what Hollaback!'s video does highlight, is what I have referred to as Urban Colonialism, also known as Gentrification, where SWPLs and sometimes Bougie Blacks, encroach upon the living spaces of working class communities inhabited by salt of the earth Black folks, and commence to tell them how to live. Oh, how white of you, Hollaback!
You see, unlike people like you Hollaback!, Blue collar Black folks don't have social mixers for young professionals to troll for potential hookups; they don't have college campuses that are in truth de facto mating grounds for the better off crowd. They don't have the church to help them meet and greet the opposite sex, because, as Murray has noted in his excellent work “Coming Apart” the church ceased being a strong force for such things a long time ago. So, you know how people in working class Black America meet?
They meet on the street. Brothas “holla” – and despite all the handwringing all of you supposed social justice warriors do, most time, it ain't no big thang. Read your “Promises I Can Keep” for more on this point. In the ‘hood – like Harlem – guys and gals meet at the Papi Store (that's the Philly slang for what New Yorkers call a bodega), or on the stoop, or just walking down the street.
Now, if you're really all that concerned about this, what you could be doing is providing better venues for guys to meet ladies – ahh, but you see, that would need you to actually address something real. We can start with these guys having meaningful employment, that sure would help, right?
As we move into 2015, it behooves all of us to keep in mind what Hollaback! is really all about, and what their true face – exemplified by Shoshona Roberts – really looks like:
A sneering, entitled, culturally tone deaf and incorrigibly racist, white chick.
And they need to be constantly reminded of that, unless or until they have shown the appropriate amount of contrition, attended the appropriate amount of culturally sensitivity trainings, and have actually addressed themselves to something that actually matters in this life.
Bang, there it is…

I'm with Waffle and Dan Wineman on this, and I think Peter Cohen really missed a lot of nuances.
Being angry about an album you were given for free does sound dumb, but due to the way iTunes purchase libraries work, that's not the whole story. As far as most people can tell, purchases stick around forever. I didn't even know you could hide purchases from your history until this, and I'm supposed to be an expert in Apple stuff.
The right way for Apple to do a big U2 promotional deal like this would have been to simply make the album free on the iTunes Store for a while and promote the hell out of that.
Instead, Apple set everyone's account to have “purchased” this album, which auto-downloaded it to all of their devices, possibly filling up the stingy base-level storage that Apple still hasn't raised and exacerbates by iOS' poor and confusing storage-management facilities. And when people see a random album they didn't buy suddenly showing up in their “purchases” and library, it makes them wonder where it came from, why it's there, whether they were charged for it, and whether they were hacked or had their credit card stolen.
It was a sloppy, hamfisted execution uncharacteristic of Apple, much like the painfully awkward, forced, cheesy Tim/Bono marketing skit announcing this promotion that slaughtered the momentum of the otherwise very important iPhone 6/Pay/Watch event.
The damage here isn't that a bunch of people need to figure out how to delete an album1 that they got for free and are now whining about. It's that Apple did something inconsiderate, tone-deaf, and kinda creepy for the sake of a relatively unimportant marketing campaign, and they seemingly didn't think it would be a problem.
It's a breach of implied boundaries. It will cost them relatively little in the grand scheme of things, but in an area that's extremely hard to recover: customer trust.
Police arrested the 33-year-old on Thursday evening after two women reported him doing an indecent act.
A man has been charged after he allegedly rode a mountain bike pantless around a West Auckland cycleway.
The 33-year-old is facing multiple charges of doing indecent acts in a public place and will appear in the Waitakere District Court on Tuesday.
Detective Senior Sergeant Roger Small said police had received "a number of reports" of a man approaching female walkers near the Henderson Creek cycleway.
"The man had then been described as having exposed himself and on several occasions had committed an indecent act."
On Thursday evening, two women reported they were walking along the cycleway when a man rode past, pantless, on a mountain bike.
He allegedly stopped at a park bench and performed an indecent act as the women walked past.
The man was arrested shortly afterwards, Small said.
"We know the community will be reassured that this man has been caught. It's very frightening for anyone who is confronted with a situation like this."
Small encouraged anyone who had experienced a similar situation to report it to police.
Madison — Republicans on an Assembly committee approved a bill Tuesday to require people to show photo ID to vote, but Democrats ripped the measure because few if any existing college IDs could be used for voting.
Republicans who control the Legislature plan to pass the measure as early as next week. GOP Gov. Scott Walker supports requiring photo ID to vote.
To make its IDs compliant with the requirements of the Assembly bill, the University of Wisconsin-Madison would have to put addresses on them. UW officials are reluctant to do that because the IDs include magnetic strips that open doors to dorm rooms, and students would be at risk of break-ins if they lost them.
The Assembly Committee on Elections and Campaign Reform approved the bill 5-3 along party lines. Republicans said they expect changes to the bill before it becomes law.
Two key Republican senators - Alberta Darling of River Hills and Joe Leibham of Sheboygan - said they did not want to allow any student IDs to be used for voting. Darling is co-chairwoman of the Joint Finance Committee, which will take up the bill Monday; Leibham sits on the committee and has worked for years on photo ID legislation.
The Assembly bill also would move the partisan primary from September to August, eliminate straight party voting for most people and sharply limit when people could vote in clerks' offices in the run-up to an election.
During debate on the bill in the Assembly committee, Rep. Kelda Helen Roys (D-Madison) said the bill would have no effect on voter fraud while disenfranchising the poor, elderly, minorities and students - and thus give Republicans an advantage.
"It's the vaccine that you need in order to protect yourself and your jobs from the harm you're doing to the public," she told Republicans.
But Rep. Jeff Stone (R-Greendale), the bill's author, said the bill was a reasonable way to fix Wisconsin elections, which he called "the most open and vulnerable elections of any state."
For months, Republicans declined to include college IDs as an acceptable form of ID for voting, but the Assembly committee agreed to allow IDs issued by accredited public and private universities and colleges in Wisconsin if they included a photo, signature, current address and date of birth. The IDs could be used only if they expired within four years of the election.
IDs issued by UW-Madison, as well as most if not all other UW schools, do not include addresses, signatures or dates of birth. The UW-Madison cards expire five years after they are issued. Marquette University's ID cards do not include addresses, signatures, birth dates or expiration dates.
All eight states that require photo IDs to vote allow college IDs, and none of the standards for those IDs is as strict as the ones proposed in Wisconsin, said Barry Burden, a UW-Madison political scientist. Some of the states do not allow IDs from private schools, however, he said.
In addition to certain student IDs, also eligible for voting purposes would be Wisconsin driver's licenses, state-issued ID cards, military IDs, passports, naturalization certificates or IDs issued by Native American tribes based in Wisconsin.
The state Department of Transportation would provide free IDs - but not driver's licenses - to those who asked for them, a provision included in the bill to ensure the ID requirement did not amount to an unconstitutional poll tax.
Providing the IDs would cost taxpayers $2.7 million a year. The Government Accountability Board, which runs elections, would need an additional $2.1 million.
The bill would go into effect in 2012. For elections before then, voters would be asked to produce photo ID. If they did not have ID, they would still be allowed to vote but would be told that ID would be required starting next year.
The measure could prevent people from voting in another's name, but not the most common form of voter fraud - felons voting while on state supervision.
The state Department of Justice and Milwaukee County district attorney's office have prosecuted 20 cases of voter fraud from the November 2008 election. None involved people voting in someone else's name at the polls.
The bill also would move the partisan primary from the second Tuesday in September to the second Tuesday in August. That change is being made to ensure Wisconsin complies with a federal law meant to ensure military and overseas voters have enough time to receive and return their ballots.
But Kevin Kennedy, the director of the Government Accountability Board, warned the Assembly committee in a letter Tuesday that the bill does not make other changes for military voters that are required under federal law.

Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen: "It is tough to come here and Villa pass the ball well. We kept our discipline and shape and had the best chance of the game [through Yannick Bolasie]. We ran out of legs trying to hurt them the other way. I am delighted with the lads' commitment. But we need to take our chances to win games of football. If that goes in, the way we are set up, it would have been hard for them to get back into the game.
"Alan [Pardew] came in after the game and congratulated everybody but he did say we need to be better going forward.
"I spoke to him before the game. He didn't interfere with tactics. After he introduced himself to the team. Hopefully he can improve the team and make us better. We need to win games to stay in this league.
"I had brief discussion with Alan and he says he is happy with the staff here and what we do. I am sure there will be more discussions. He will look at the staff and structure but at the moment he has told us to get on with it and work hard."
In a private meeting with Syrian opposition leaders, Secretary of State John Kerry said he believed the international community “wasted a year” by not working together to help topple strongman Bashar al-Assad.
The various countries trying to help the Free Syrian Army had failed to coordinate their efforts effectively for a long time, Kerry said inside the private meeting last Thursday with Syrian Opposition Coalition president Ahmad Jarba, according to three participants in the meeting. And that lack of coordination had dramatically set back the drive to stop Assad's rampage and counter the growing terrorism threat.
All three participants in the meeting requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the gathering, which was held at the State Department in Washington, D.C. Several State Department officials, at least one National Security Council staffer, and several representatives of the Syrian Opposition Coalition and the Supreme Military Council were in attendance.
The participants said Kerry made the remark in the context of a discussion about renewed efforts to coordinate the flow of both aid and weapons to the Syrian rebels. Earlier this year, the intelligence chiefs of several Arab countries came to Washington to work on concentrating the flow of aid away from more extremist elements—and toward moderate rebels such as the FSA. The group is fighting hard-liners such as the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Sham (ISIS) all over northern Syria.
Days after that meeting, the FSA's Supreme Military Council appointed a new leader, Brig. Gen. Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir. And in recent weeks, the rebels have begun to receive and use American-made anti-tank missiles, part of a “pilot program” to test the Supreme Military Council's ability to handle advanced weapons responsibly and prevent their proliferation to extremist groups.
Bashir sat down for an exclusive interview with The Daily Beast on Sunday. The main purpose of the Syrian Opposition Coalition delegation's trip to Washington, he said, was to ask for anti-aircraft weapons to protect Syrian civilians from regime air strikes, which lately have included barrel bombs and chlorine gas attacks on civilian targets. Bashir also asked the United States to take the lead on the international effort to provide aid and arms to the Syrian Opposition Civilian and military leadership.
Inside the meeting, Kerry told the Syrian opposition leaders that he understood their desire for more advanced arms. But he did not make any specific commitments for new American aid. He told the Syrian leaders the United States had been doing its best to help the Syria people and would continue to do so.
“Secretary Kerry was very emotional and sympathetic to the Syrian cause, and he supports the Syrian revolution and the Syrian people,” Bashir said. “We have so much hope that there will be changes in the policy.”
It's been well reported that Kerry has been frustrated with the Obama administration's Syria policy for a long time and has been advocating internally for more robust aid to the rebels, only to be stymied repeatedly by the White House.
Bashir acknowledged that the United States has been heavily involved in the recent increase of advanced arms to parts of the Free Syrian Army. He argued that the FSA's handling of the TOW anti-tank missiles should give the American government enough confidence to start providing anti-aircraft weapons, as well.
“The FSA has been dealing very well with the TOW missiles. Under our protection, people are trained to use them, and it is with the collaboration and under the supervision of the United States,” Bashir said. “The main purpose for our visit is to get anti-aircraft weapons to protect innocent civilians inside Syria, and we are hoping the United States is going to help us push aside Assad's air force.”
Jarba, the Syrian Opposition Coalition president, told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday that he will ask Pentagon and White House officials directly for anti-aircraft weapons early this week. President Obama is expected to “drop by” Jarba's White House meeting. Jarba is promising strict safeguards to ensure the weapons are used only by trained rebel officers and won't fall into extremist hands.
Bashir said that if the U.S. takes the lead, coordinates all the lethal aid between countries helping Syria, and puts it under the umbrella of the Supreme Military Council, that could give the U.S. government more confidence that any weapons provided to the rebels would be handled responsibly. The council has agreed to establish two central coordination units inside Syria, one in the south and one in the north, Bashir said, but it does not yet have control over the arms flows.
“We want to collaborate our efforts with all of our allies, to have one directed effort to help Syria, one support channel to the SMC. That needs to be led by the United States,” he said.
The Free Syrian Army is now fighting on two fronts, against the regime and against ISIS. The Syrian Opposition Coalition has compiled extensive evidence that the regime and ISIS are cooperating to fight against the FSA, by aiding each other both on and off the battlefield. The New York Times has reported that ISIS is selling oil directly to the regime, helping fuel Assad's war machine while filling its own coffers.
“We consider ISIS an arm of the Syrian regime,” said Bashir. “We ask the United States to give us sophisticated weaponry or at least to give other allies the green light to give us sophisticated weaponry, because that has not been the case thus far. If the United States doesn't help us with sophisticated weaponry, Syria is going to be dominated by al Qaeda, and that is going to be a threat to the entire world.”
In Washington, the debate has focused on whether to help establish a no-fly zone over parts of Syria, using American military force to protect Syrian civilians in danger. Some lawmakers also have called for U.S. strikes on Assad's air force. Bashir said anti-aircraft weapons would make those two controversial options unnecessary.
“If you provide us with anti-aircraft missiles, there's no need for a no-fly zone,” he said. “We are not asking for you to send American men and women to fight in Syria.”
Overall, the Syrian Opposition Coalition is asking all the American leaders it meets with in Washington for the United States to do more, both diplomatically and militarily, to help turn the tide of the war back in favor of the revolution.
“There's a Syrian saying that you can't hide the sun with a screen, and you can't hide the fact that the United States is the one that can decide when this war ends, and we hope that the United States will put an end to this,” he said.

January 18, 2012 ranks among the most momentous days in the recent history of the copyright reform movement. Who can forget the blackout protests against SOPA and its Senate counterpart PIPA? That day's actions boasted unprecedented scale, which included dozens of companies, thousands of websites, and millions of users acting together to defeat dangerous legislation. But the date also marks another, less cheerful event: exactly one year ago today, the Supreme Court released its decision in Golan v. Holder, a ruling that remains a disaster for the public domain. (You'll remember that in Golan, the Court upheld a law that took millions of works by foreign authors that were previously in the public domain and put them back under copyright protection.)
That single day in 2012 demonstrates the real dangers copyright policy poses to users, consumers, and creators and — at the same time — just how far we've come in fighting back. (Though, to be clear, we still have more work to do.)
Golan harkens back to an earlier era, sparked by the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act — sometimes known as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act — and the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Like the earlier Eldred v. Ashcroft, Golan centers around a constitutional challenge to the expansion of copyright. The argument goes like this: the Constitution grants Congress the power to make so-called intellectual property laws so long as those laws "promote the progress of science and useful arts"; retroactive copyright extensions and retractions from the public domain plainly do not serve that goal; thus, these laws stand in conflict with the Constitution.
This argument is correct, but it has proved frustratingly ineffective in the Supreme Court and in the halls of Congress. In Eldred, the Court approved retroactive extensions despite strong briefs from, among others, constitutional law experts, dozens of IP law professors, and world-famous economists. And in Golan, only the dissent bothered to note the obvious fact that ripping material out of the public domain "does not encourage anyone to produce a single new work". It's not just the Courts: all too often in Congress, debates about copyright law take place in a "reality-free zone".
While reasonable minds may disagree on some particulars in copyright, Congress and the courts often get the easy questions wrong. The resulting laws contravene not just the Constitution, but common sense. Why is this? Many rightfully point to the influence of entrenched interests. And certainly, those interested in increasing the scope and scale of copyright law — often led by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) — wield considerable influence in Washington. That influence puts blinders on even well-meaning legislators, preventing them from enacting real evidence-based policies. (Of course, not all legislators fall into this category: take Senator Ron Wyden, and Representatives Darrell Issa and Zoe Lofgren, for instance, who were vocal opponents of PIPA and SOPA from the beginning.)
But January 18 reminded us of another important lesson: it's not just Congress and the courts who wield all the power in a democracy. It's the people, too. So when those in D.C. refused to fix a system gone awry and introduced SOPA and PIPA — threatening to dangerously increase the scope of copyright law again — the people took notice and acted. It's no wonder, of course: while policymakers have been busy extending copyright's reach, people have increasingly bumped up against it in their daily lives. Computers are copying machines, and many of us work at one each day, even carrying one around in our pockets. Even through the haze of copyright laws at their most bloated, people have seen glimpses of the power of unfettered networks — and want more.
As a result, the gap between the law on the books and how common sense suggests copyright should look has grown massive. That is unsustainable. In the anti-SOPA blackout protest, the public finally stood up and demanded that gap be closed. It spoke with such force that Congress had no choice but to listen.
The entrenched interests tried to paint this grassroots action as "dangerous" and a "gimmick," as a "misuse of power". The public knows better than that. Copyright must be reworked to serve the public interest, and those who benefit from lopsided laws will not let it go without a fight.
Over the past 15 years, copyright reform advocates have been frustrated by judges and legislators who won't engage with the facts and refuse to have a serious conversation about copyright. It turns out the public will, and has — leading to protests like the SOPA blackout or the street actions in Europe against the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. When we all speak up together, we're impossible to ignore. January 18 taught us that the days of backroom deals and one-sided debates are over, so long as we remember that simple lesson.
The chief executive of a catering company that serves major sports arenas resigned Tuesday over an animal abuse incident caught on tape.
The video of the 46-second elevator ride is hard to watch. It shows a man in jeans and a T-shirt strolling into an elevator at the Private Residences at the Hotel Georgia, a luxury condo building in downtown Vancouver. He kicks a Doberman Pinscher puppy trotting beside him as he steps inside. The dog obediently sits as the doors close. The man then kicks the dog repeatedly, causing it to shrink away from his abuser. Not once does it attempt to fight back by biting or jumping. The man then leans over towards the dog before standing up and violently jerking the leash several times, so hard it lifts the animal off the floor. He kicks it a few more times before exiting the elevator.
A search warrant obtained Aug. 22 by Canada's Global News identified the man as Desmond Hague, president and chief executive of Centerplate, a catering company based in Stamford, Conn., that serves fans at sports and entertainment arenas. These include Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, where they offer vegan hot dogs, Safeco Field in Seattle, and FedExField in Washington, D.C.
The video was dated July 27, but authorities weren't alerted until weeks later, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported, when a condominium employee sent the video to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in British Columbia. When they went to investigate, SPCA officers found the puppy, named Sade, at the condo in a crate that stank of urine with food and water bowls out of reach, the Vancouver Sun said. She appeared to have been abused and was skittish around people.
Hague initially told the SPCA that the dog was his, but they have since determined it belongs to someone else who stepped forward after the incident was made public, Fortune reported.
SPCA's chief prevention and enforcement officer Marcie Moriarty told the Sun they took the dog to safety and later determined there was “no real lasting physical damage.” However, they are recommending that charges of abuse be filed against Hague.
The video quickly circulated online, prompting some fans to say they wouldn't buy food at stadiums served by the company. “I'm not buying anything that this guy sells here – it's a disgrace,” BC Lions fan John Kinney told Global News. Fans in the United States, where NFL preseason was underway, also threatened to boycott.
San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said the city would review its $17 million contract with Centerplate, which is set to expire in February, and called Hague's actions “disturbing,” the San Diego Union Tribune reported.
In a statement sent to Fortune, the San Francisco 49ers, whose fans are served by Centerplate at Levi's stadium, said the organization “condemns the abuse of animals and was disturbed to learn of the recent news regarding Des Hague. We believe his actions are not reflective of the efforts and service provided by the hundreds of Centerplate employees working to present our fans with a tremendous experience at Levi's Stadium.”
Hague admitted to the abuse in an Aug. 24 statement obtained by the Sun. “I take full responsibility for my actions,” he wrote, before blaming the incident on “a minor frustration with a friend's pet” that caused him “to lose control of my emotional response.”
On social media, people across the United States and Canada called for Hague to be fired.
According to statements obtained by Fortune, Centerplate dismissed the situation as “a personal matter involving Des Hague” in an Aug. 25 statement. The next day they announced Hague would undergo anger management counseling. A third statement on Aug. 27 declared that Hague was on probation, would serve 1,000 hours of community service and had agreed to donate $100,000 of his own money to an animal charity.
Hague told Fortune in an e-mail last Thursday that he was “deeply ashamed” and “will atone for many years to come.” He added: “I believe the steps I have taken and the sanctions imposed by the board in the long run will actually see many more animals safe and better protected.”
Animal lovers were not appeased. A Change.org petition calling for Hague's removal had accumulated more than 180,000 signatures by Tuesday — more than enough to fill every seat at FedExField and the Rose Bowl stadium — when the company finally announced that Hague was stepping down.
“The decision comes as a result of Hague's personal misconduct involving the mistreatment of an animal in his care,” Joe O'Donnell, chairman of the board of directors for Centerplate wrote on the company's Web site. “We want to reiterate that we do not condone nor would we ever overlook the abuse of animals. … Following an extended review of the incident involving Mr. Hague, I'd like to apologize for the distress that this situation has caused to so many; but also thank our employees, clients and guests who expressed their feelings about this incident. Their voices helped us to frame our deliberations during this very unusual and unfortunate set of circumstances.”
Chris Verros, formerly the company's chief operating officer, replaced Hague as acting president and chief executive.
Correction: This story previously said Levi's Stadium is in San Francisco.
C URSE thee, Life, I will live with thee no more! Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore! And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me, I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly That I might eat again, and met thy sneers 5 With deprecations, and thy blows with tears, Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away, As if spent passion were a holiday! And now I go. Nor threat, nor easy vow Of tardy kindness can avail thee now 10 With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown; Lonely I came, and I depart alone, And know not where nor unto whom I go; But that thou canst not follow me I know. Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain 15 My thought ran still, until I spake again: Ah, but I go not as I came,no trace Is mine to bear away of that old grace I brought! I have been heated in thy fires, Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires, 20 Thy mark is on me! I am not the same Nor ever more shall be, as when I came. Ashes am I of all that once I seemed. In me alls sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed Is wakeful for alarm,oh, shame to thee, 25 For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me, Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing! Ah, life, I would have been a pleasant thing To have about the house when I was grown If thou hadst left my little joys alone! 30 I asked of thee no favor save this one: That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun! And this thou didst deny, calling my name Insistently, until I rose and came. I saw the sun no more.It were not well 35 So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell, Need I arise to-morrow and renew Again my hated tasks, but I am through With all things save my thoughts and this one night, So that in truth I seem already quite 40 Free and remote from thee,I feel no haste And no reluctance to depart; I taste Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught, That in a little while I shall have quaffed. Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled, 45 Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed Before me one by one till once again I set new words unto an old refrain: Treasures thou hast that never have been mine! Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine 50 Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown Like blossoms out to me that sat alone! And I have waited well for thee to show If any share were mine,and now I go! Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain 55 I shall but come into mine own again! Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more, But turning, straightway, sought a certain door In the rear wall. Heavy it was, and low And dark,a way by which none eer would go 60 That other exit had, and never knock Was heard thereat,bearing a curious lock Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily, Whereof Life held content the useless key, And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust, 65 Whose sudden voice across a silence must, I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear, A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.So near I came I felt upon my feet the chill Of acid wind creeping across the sill. 70 So stood longtime, till over me at last Came weariness, and all things other passed To make it room; the still night drifted deep Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep. But, suddenly, marking the morning hour, 75 Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower! Startled, I raised my head,and with a shout Laid hold upon the latch,and was without.
. . . . . . Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road, Leading me back unto my old abode, 80 My fathers house! There in the night I came, And found them feasting, and all things the same As they had been before. A splendour hung Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung As, echoing out of very long ago, 85 Had called me from the house of Life, I know. So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame On the unlovely garb in which I came; Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked: It is my fathers house! I said and knocked; 90 And the door opened. To the shining crowd Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud, Seeing no face but his; to him I crept, And Father! I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept. Ah, days of joy that followed! All alone 95 I wandered through the house. My own, my own, My own to touch, my own to taste and smell, All I had lacked so long and loved so well! None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song, Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long. 100 I know not when the wonder came to me Of what my fathers business might be, And whither fared and on what errands bent The tall and gracious messengers he sent. Yet one day with no song from dawn till night 105 Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight. And the next day I called; and on the third Asked them if I might go,but no one heard. Then, sick with longing, I arose at last And went unto my father,in that vast 110 Chamber wherein he for so many years Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres. Father, I said, Father, I cannot play The harp that thou didst give me, and all day I sit in idleness, while to and fro 115 About me thy serene, grave servants go; And I am weary of my lonely ease. Better a perilous journey overseas Away from thee, than this, the life I lead, To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed 120 That grows to naught,I love thee more than they Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way. Father, I beg of thee a little task To dignify my days,tis all I ask Forever, but forever, this denied, 125 I perish.
Child, my fathers voice replied, All things thy fancy hath desired of me Thou hast received. I have prepared for thee Within my house a spacious chamber, where Are delicate things to handle and to wear, 130 And all these things are thine. Dost thou love song? My minstrels shall attend thee all day long. Or sigh for flowers? My fairest gardens stand Open as fields to thee on every hand. And all thy days this word shall hold the same: 135 No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name. But as for tasks he smiled, and shook his head; Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by, he said.
Stunning new video posted on Instagram shows what possibly led to a fiery crash in Mississauga last week.
On Thursday, the driver of a car crashed on Aerowood Drive, near Highway 401 and Dixie Road. It happened shortly after an interaction with motorcyclists on the highway.
While the video shows what appears to be a road rage incident between motorcyclists and a driver, police have not yet confirmed if it is the same high-speed interaction.
“Watching it, I don't see licence plates, [so] it's hard to identify who these riders are,” OPP Sgt. Kerry Schmidt told CityNews on Monday.
In the video, which was posted to Instagram two days ago, bikers are seen performing dangerous stunts on Highway 427 approaching the westbound Highway 401, weaving in and out of traffic as a black Volkswagen car appears to drive aggressively next to the motorcycles.
Instagram-user “chris_1che” posted the video. According to “chris_1che,” the driver of the car threw “his McDonald's drink at the bikers.” The alleged toss is seen in the second video posted by the Instagram user.
Last Thursday, a wild night on the 401 saw a driver and a passenger get into a confrontation with a group of motorcyclists, before the car crashed and burst into flames.
The incident began around 10:50 p.m. near the Dixie Road off-ramp. It appears the driver of the car was trying to get around a group of motorcyclists that was blocking the westbound lanes and weaving in and out of traffic.
A woman who was in the car said one of at least six motorcyclists who were driving erratically became violent and “knocked me unconscious.”
The woman, who did not want her named used, said the motorcyclists were blocking all three lanes of traffic.
“My boyfriend pulled up next to them and I rolled down the window and told them to move,” she said.
“[The motorcyclist] told me to f*** off, so I did the same. Two seconds later he's three inches away from my window – he could have brushed my hair that's how close he was – going 100 kilometres an hour on a motorcycle. He takes his fist and smashes my right mirror off. I told my boyfriend to get off at Dixie Road because I was freaking out,” she said.
The woman was left at Dixie and the driver took off. He was arrested and charged after the crash.
Andrei Sisu, 22, from Kitchener, faces a number of charges including dangerous driving, several drug offences and breach of probation
We inquire the road to Escondido and Father Doyle tells us that the shortest route is to cross the river and strike over the hills to Lilac and Valley Center. It may be the shortest route, but a rougher, steeper, stonier byroad is not common, even in California. It winds along the hill-crests with sharp little pitches and short turns that will compel any driver to attend carefully to business. It would have been better to follow the river to the junction with the main road, though the distance is a few miles farther. At Valley Center-which is only a ranch-house-we came into a fairly good highway which steadily improved as we approached Escondido. It was on this fine road that we spied a huge rattlesnake basking in the afternoon sun, too lazy or too defiant to make much effort to get out of the way of our wheels, which passed over him. A blow from a rock finished him, and his twelve-jointed rattle was added to our trophies. It seemed a pity to leave his beautifully marked sepia-brown skin, but we had no facilities for removing and caring for it.

Escondido means "hidden," a name probably suggested by the location of the little town deep in the mammoth hills. It is, however, the best town on the inland route between Riverside and San Diego, and though small, it is apparently an energetic community. The main street was being macadamized and improved for some distance out of the town, and a large hotel and handsome schoolhouse testified to its enterprise. For some miles to the south of the town the road is straight and level; then we re-enter the hills and begin the ascent of the finely engineered Poway grade. The road swings up the giant hills in long, easy loops and as we near the summit the whole grade lies before our eyes as we look backward down the canyon. From the crest there is another wonderful view of hills touched with the declining sun and wooded canyons shrouded in the amethystine haze of evening. To the right a road cuts across the hills to La Jolla by the sea and we followed this on one occasion. It is a narrow, little-used road running along the hill-crests or clinging precariously to their sides, but it proved smoother and easier than we anticipated. It passes through Miramar-the great country estate of a millionaire newspaper man-comprising many thousands of acres. Some of the land was cultivated, but the great bulk of it is in cattle ranges. For miles we saw no human habitation and had some difficulty in keeping the right road. We came into the main coast road a few miles north of La Jolla and hastened to Del Mar-of which more anon-where we preferred to pass the night rather than at San Diego.

On our first trip, however, we continued on our way to the city and gliding down Poway grade we came to a fork in the road with a sign informing us that one branch led to San Diego by Murphy Canyon and the other by Murray Canyon. We chose the former, believing, for obvious reasons, that it must be the best, and soon came into the new-old town on the quiet, land-locked harbor, where the white man's work in California had its beginnings.

If one wishes to stop within the city of San Diego, he will find the U. S. Grant Hotel equal to the best metropolitan hostelries and when he comes to settle his bill, will also learn that the best metropolitan establishments "have nothing on" the Grant in the way of stiff charges. It is a huge, concrete structure-"absolutely fire-proof," of course-and its interior appointments and furnishings are in keeping with its imposing exterior. It is justly the pride of San Diego and, despite the marvelous growth of the town, it will be long before it outgrows this magnificent hotel.
There is much for the tourist stranger to see about San Diego-the the oldest settlement of the white man in California. The motor car affords ideal means for covering the surrounding country in the shortest time and with the assistance of the excellent maps of the Auto Club of Southern California, one can easily locate the points of interest in the immediate vicinity outside the limits of the city.

The old mission will usually be the first objective, and more especially it appeals to ourselves, who have already determined to traverse the entire length of the King's Highway to visit all the decaying monuments to the work of the zealous Franciscan padres. It has a special significance as the earliest Spanish settlement in California and as the beginning of a movement that has widely influenced the history and architecture of the state. The story of its founding I have already told in brief; its history in a general way was much the same as that of San Gabriel. Our outline of the mission play in a preceding chapter gives a true conception of its earliest days; owing to the distrust of the natives it was long before converts were made in considerable numbers. The region about was well peopled, but only seventy-one converts had been secured by 1774, six years after Serra's landing. A year later the mission was attacked by a horde of savages, variously estimated at from five to eight hundred, who burned the rude brush-roofed building to the ground and murdered Father Jayme, one of the priests. When news of the disaster reached Father Serra, who had gone northward to Monterey, he rejoiced in the martyrdom of his friend. "God be praised!" he cried. "The soil is now watered," thus accepting the calamity as a presage of victory to come. The troubles with the natives continued until 1779, when they were pacified by some of their number being made officials in the society, Alcades and Regidores, as they were styled. These dignitaries administered justice to their own people under the direction of the padres and from this time the progress of the mission was rapid. In 1800 it was the most populous of the missions, its neophytes numbering fifteen hundred and twenty-three. More substantial buildings had been erected and an extensive scheme of irrigation had been begun, remains of which astonish the beholder to-day. The great dam is in a gorge about three miles above the mission. It was built of gray granite twelve feet thick and stands as firm and solid as ever, though it is now nearly filled with sand.

The mission's prosperity continued, with occasional interruptions on account of differences with the natives, until the secularization in 1833. After this the Indians were gradually scattered and were decimated in frequent clashes with the Spanish soldiers. Eleven years later an official report showed but one hundred natives connected with the mission as against more than fifteen hundred in its palmy days-a fact which needs no elucidation to show the results of Mexican confiscation. The buildings were reported by a United States officer to be "in good preservation" in 1852, and were then occupied by American troops.
Researchers say why hormone medication may not work on breast cancer. UPI/Bill Greenblatt | License Photo
DALLAS, Nov. 10 (UPI) -- As cholesterol is metabolized, a potent stimulant of breast cancer is created -- one that fuels estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, U.S. researchers say.
Senior author Dr. Philip Shaul, professor and vice chair for research in pediatrics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a member of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, says a multidisciplinary team discovered that the cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol promotes tumor growth in estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers -- the most common type of breast cancer.
Estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer was previously believed to be stimulated primarily by the female sex hormone estrogen and it is commonly treated using endocrine-based medications that starve tumors of estrogen, Shaul said.
The discovery of 27HC as another driver of breast cancer may explain why endocrine-based therapy is often unsuccessful, providing a new target for therapy, the researchers say.
"This information can be used to develop new therapies that inhibit 27HC action or production, or increase its metabolism, in effect cutting the cancer off from a key growth stimulator," Shaul says in a statement.
Implications of the research, published in Cell Reports, are significant, Shaul says.
One million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States and about two-thirds of those are hormone receptor-positive -- meaning they contain receptors for the hormones estrogen and/or progesterone, the American Cancer Society calculates. Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer is particularly prevalent following menopause.
Resistance to commonly used endocrine-based therapies occurs frequently.
If Iraqi soldiers don't make progress in the coming months, the Pentagon should recommend embedding troops on the battlefield, says Gen. Raymond Odierno, the outgoing Army chief of staff.
Gen. Ray Odierno, the U.S. Army's top officer, pushed back on the Iraq War blame game that has dominated the GOP 2016 presidential campaign trail, saying that the U.S. military's withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 was the Bush administration's plan all along. Odierno, formerly the senior U.S. general in Iraq, said he was unconvinced at the time that the Iraqi parliament would have approved a longer stay for American troops had Obama administration officials successfully negotiated for it.
The Iraq War has jumped back into headlines recently as Republican candidates attempt to tie the U.S. withdrawal in 2011 — and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's role in it — to the rise of the Islamic State. In a major national security speech on Tuesday, Jeb Bush criticized Clinton and President Barack Obama for removing U.S. troops from Iraq. “That premature withdrawal was the fatal error, creating the void that ISIS moved in to fill – and that Iran has exploited to the full as well,” said Bush, a former Florida governor and brother of President George W. Bush.
Odierno, who is to retire Friday, spent much of his final press conference at the Pentagon reflecting on what might have prevented the Iraqi government from falling apart after American troops left. They departed in December 2011, after which the Iraqi Security Forces “became significantly politicized,” he said.
“I remind everybody, us leaving at the end of 2011 was negotiated in 2008 by the Bush administration. That was always the plan. We had promised them that we would respect their sovereignty,” said Odierno, who commanded troops in Iraq for more than five years between 2003 and 2010, including two years as the top American general in the country.
Keeping U.S. troops in Iraq beyond 2011 would have required the Iraqi parliament's approval, which was hardly guaranteed.
“I don't know if we could have convinced them to do that or not,” Odierno said. “I will say we had the same problem initially, when we initially hammered out the [status of forces] agreement in '08 as well.” Without that agreement, U.S. troops ran the risk of being arrested for any misconduct.
Odierno said he was not part of the Obama administration's negotiations to extend the U.S. military's stay. But considerable reporting has documented the administration's efforts at the time to craft an Iraqi government it felt was needed to justify keeping U.S. troops there after the Bush agreement expired in December 2011. Critics, including Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have said for years they believe Obama's team did not really try to persuade Baghdad to accept an extension, and instead allowed the Bush-negotiated agreement to expire so that Obama could fulfill his campaign promise to end the Iraq War.
“I think the military operations we conducted provided an opportunity for us to be successful,” Odierno said, a refrain he has diplomatically repeated since his dramatic departure from Baghdad.
Asked if the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was a mistake, Odierno said, “All I know is that Saddam Hussein was an incredibly ruthless person who was suppressing his population.”
“I talked to all the Iraqi generals,” he said. “They'll tell you there were nuclear weapons. They believed there were. The bottom line is they absolutely believe there were nuclear weapons on the ground. To say we shouldn't have gone in there now because we know there wasn't any or we didn't find any, I think is a little bit of hindsight.
“We don't know where we would be right now if Saddam Hussein was still in power,” Odierno continued. “He was moving toward terrorism and I believe if he continued to have problems, we don't know what he might have done in terms of being part of the problem with terrorism.”
Looking forward, Odierno expressed further support for embedding American soldiers with Iraqi Security Forces fighting ISIS militants.
“I believe that if we find in the next several months we're not making the progress … we should probably absolutely consider embedding some soldiers with them, see if that would make a difference,” Odierno said. “That doesn't mean they would be fighting, but it's maybe embedding them and moving with them. I think that's an option we should present to the president when the time is right.”
Standing before a podium raised to accommodate his 6-foot, 6-inch frame, the general said the solution to sectarian rivalry in the wartorn nation might be an Iraq that “might not look like it did in the past.”
But it's up to the Arab states and diplomats, not the military, to figure that out, Odierno said. “I absolutely believe that the region has to solve this problem,” he said. “The U.S. cannot solve this problem for the region. They have got to get involved and we got to be part of the solution.”
When U.S soldiers were in Iraq during the last decade, it “allowed us to be honest brokers” between different sects, Odierno said. “I think maybe as we all look back, leaving some soldiers on the ground might have helped a little bit and maybe prevented where we are now,” he said.
Before any lines are redrawn on the map, Iraq must deal with ISIS first.
“I think ISIL has been vaunted somewhat,” Odierno said when asked if the militant group is winning. “They have not made any progress since we started airstrikes. I think we have gained back some territory, mostly by the great work of the Kurds and some work by the Iraqi Security Forces.”
American combat forces could probably defeat ISIS, Odierno said, but within months after leaving, separatists would likely rise again without political and economic improvements.
“For me it's about changing the dynamics, the political dynamics, the economic dynamics and it has to be done by those in the region,” Odierno said. “I think it's important for us to support that. It's important for us to support that by training and trying to develop capability and capacity.”
In May, Odierno said that embedding U.S. troops, who have been training and advising the Iraqis since last year, “probably would make this more effective,” but could possibly could deepen sectarian or ISIS violence.
ISIS still retains between 20,000 and 30,000 soldiers despite a year of American-led airstrikes which U.S. officials say have killed thousands of militants and extremist leaders.
“They're not as capable as they were a year ago, they're not as capable as they were 18 months ago,” he said. “But they are still able to recruit, and get people to come in and fight — and that's what's concerning to me. This is why this is not a solely military solution.”
Summary: The degree of global warming during the next few years might have large political effects, as the public policy debate appears to be at a critical point in its 29th year (from Hansen's Senate testimony). Will the pause resume, or will we get rapid warming? Close examination of the monthly data will give us clues about this important question.
How can we see the short-term temperature trend?
There is no one true way to show trends in global temperature. Here are three different perspectives; all give roughly similar results. First, let's look at a graph by NOAA of the global average surface temperature (their excellent interactive website shows data since the reliable instrument era began in 1880). The time period selected depends on what we are looking for. The following graph shows January's. It minimizes the overall warming trend, which is concentrated in the months of May, June, & July. Click to enlarge.
The warming since 1950 — the period in which over half of the warming comes from anthropogenic causes — occurred almost entirely in two steps: 1981-83 (near the 1979-83 El Niño period) and 1998-99 (near the 1997-98 El Niño). Since then climate scientists have shown that the two century-long temperature rise has “paused” (aka the “hiatus”). There are various theories about the cause. Then came the spike of the 2015-2016 El Niño. The peak to peak rise, 1998 to 2016, was only 0.4°F.
What happens next? The El Niño might have been just a spike, after which temperatures will fall back to the 1998-2014 average — and the “pause” continues. If temperatures don't fall back to their previous levels, then we begin a new watch. Will the 2015-16 El Niño start another stair step, with temperatures flat at a new high level? Or will temperatures begin a steady rise? The one month anomalies provide an easy if rough way to see which of these three scenarios unfolds, each having different political implications. Unfortunately, climate models cannot yet make reliable predictions for five to ten years horizons
NOAA: Global surface temperatures for January.
Purpose line added for the 1998-2014 average: the “pause”.
After the El Niño, some skeptics predicted a strong La Niña that would drop temperatures back to the levels of the pause. The major models correctly predicted that would not happen; there was only a brief weak La Niña. Starting in September, temperatures have been dropping slightly on a year-over-year basis — down 0.18°C YoY in January. It is too soon to draw any conclusions.
Satellites provide a second perspective.
For a second perspective, see the lower troposphere temperatures recorded by satellites (prepared for NASA by U AL-Huntsville). The below graph is by UAH lead scientists Roy Spencer. It tells a roughly similar story. Showing the full time series (not just January's) gives more detail than the above graph — with more noise. It shows an El Nino spike in 2015-16, followed by a large, fast drop. Will it return to the previous plateau, start a new plateau, or begin steady growth? Click to enlarge.
The oceans give the best perspective.
In 2003 Roger Pielke Sr. said that the best measure of global warming is the total heat content of the world's oceans (OHC). He was called a “denier”. Now ocean heat content (OHC) is the third measure of warming commonly used by climate scientists. NOAA posts this graph of annual OHC, showing the temperature anomaly vs. the reference period 1955-2006. The trend since 1970 is only 0.04°F per decade, slower than the surface atmosphere trend of 0.31°F). OHC is little affected by the weather, and clearly shows the warming trend since 1970.
Vital background about the temperature record.
“It is extremely likely (95 – 100% certain) that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature from 1951 to 2010.”
— One of the most important conclusions of IPCC's AR5 Working Group I.
This statement about past warming is important. But for making public policy decisions future warming we need to know the odds of various amounts of warming during the 21st century. There is no easy answer to this, let alone a consensus of climate scientists about it. So climate activists either ignore the research (such as the 4 scenarios described in AR5) or focus on the worst of these (the truly horrific RCP8.5) while ignoring its unlikely assumptions.
So far the weather has sided with the skeptics, with little of the extreme weather activists predicted. No surge of hurricanes after Katrina (despite the predictions). No sign of the methane monster. Northern hemisphere snow extent has risen since in both the Fall and the Winter. There is little evidence that we have passed one of the often declared “tipping points”.
So it is logical that — despite the efforts of government agencies, academia, and many ngo's — the public's policy priorities have been unaffected by the warming campaign (details here). Republican control of the Presidency, Congress, and most States makes policy action almost impossible for the next 4 years (ceteris paribus). As a result, activists are going thru the 5 stages of grief for their campaign.
Why do global temperatures rise erratically as CO2 steadily increases?
“Nonlinearities, feedbacks and critical thresholds within the Earth's climate system” by José A. Rial et al, in Climatic Change, July 2004.
“The Earth's climate system is highly nonlinear: inputs and outputs are not proportional, change is often episodic and abrupt, rather than slow and gradual, and multiple equilibria are the norm. While this is widely accepted, there is a relatively poor understanding of the different types of nonlinearities, how they manifest under various conditions, and whether they reflect a climate system driven by astronomical forcings, by internal feedbacks, or by a combination of both. …”
Update : new paper addresses this exact question
“Reconciling the signal and noise of atmospheric warming on decadal timescales” by Roger N. Jones and James H. Ricketts in Earth Systems Dynamics, 16 March 2017 — Abstract (red emphasis added)…
“Interactions between externally forced and internally generated climate variations on decadal timescales is a major determinant of changing climate risk. Severe testing is applied to observed global and regional surface and satellite temperatures and modelled surface temperatures to determine whether these interactions are independent, as in the traditional signal-to-noise model, or whether they interact, resulting in step-like warming. The multistep bivariate test is used to detect step changes in temperature data. The resulting data are then subject to six tests designed to distinguish between the two statistical hypotheses, hstep and htrend.
“Test 1: since the mid-20th century, most observed warming has taken place in four events: in 1979/80 and 1997/98 at the global scale, 1988/89 in the Northern Hemisphere and 1968–70 in the Southern Hemisphere. Temperature is more step-like than trend-like on a regional basis. Satellite temperature is more step-like than surface temperature. Warming from internal trends is less than 40 % of the total for four of five global records tested …
“Test 2: correlations between step-change frequency in observations and models (1880–2005) are 0.32 (CMIP3) and 0.34 (CMIP5). For the period 1950–2005, grouping selected events (1963/64, 1968–70, 1976/77, 1979/80, 1987/88 and 1996–98), the correlation increases to 0.78.
“Test 3: steps and shifts (steps minus internal trends) from a 107-member climate model ensemble (2006–2095) explain total warming and equilibrium climate sensitivity better than internal trends.
“Test 4: in three regions tested, the change between stationary and non-stationary temperatures is step-like and attributable to external forcing.
“Test 5: step-like changes are also present in tide gauge observations, rainfall, ocean heat content and related variables.
“Test 6: across a selection of tests, a simple stepladder model better represents the internal structures of warming than a simple trend, providing strong evidence that the climate system is exhibiting complex system behaviour on decadal timescales. This model indicates that in situ warming of the atmosphere does not occur; instead, a store-and-release mechanism from the ocean to the atmosphere is proposed. It is physically plausible and theoretically sound.
“The presence of step-like – rather than gradual – warming is important information for characterising and managing future climate risk.”

Ubisoft Senior Vice President of Marketing and Sales Tony Key has told Gamespot that Far Cry 3's success has already greenlit a sequel (though this one will probably have fewer laser dragons in it).
"We're totally psyched from [Far Cry 3],” Key said. “It's a great brand, and now it's got the recognition it deserves, so we're clearly going to make another one: more on that soon."

Key went on to talk about how Ubisoft's investing most of its time and resources into open world games, though you don't need to be a financial analyst to figure that one out. Both of Ubisoft's big new IPs, Watch_Dogs and The Division are open world. Add Far Cry and Assassin's Creed into the mix and it's enough to make you wonder when Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia will hit the open world.
Of course, Key didn't actually say when we'd actually hear more about Far Cry 4, so we'll just continue fighting our losing battle with the unstoppable beast known as the cassowary until that day arrives.
× Skrillex coming to Electric Forest?
ROTHBURY, Mich. — Is one of the biggest names in electronic and dubstep music coming to this year's Electric Forest Festival in Rothbury? If a Tweet that was posted on Tuesday — and then deleted shortly thereafter — is to be believed, we may already have the answer.
Skrillex tweeted out, “So excited to play @Electric_Forest this year…I haven't been since the first one in 2011!”
The tweet was deleted, but not before electric music website edm.com got a hold of it and posted the entire thing.
So far, nothing has been confirmed by Electric Forest, and there is still plenty of speculation about who will be on the bill for this year's hugely popular music festival. The festival is scheduled to run June 25 – 28.

LOL, how does the saying go, live your life in such a way that you can let the town gossip borrow your bird for a week.. I've also heard, live your life in such a way that you can give your parrot to the priest without anxiety or something like that? Yeah I would fail in this category. Sookie regularly repeats, SAY WHAT? WHAT THE H##L ?!? And a few other vibrant words that will go unsaid because I'm too ashamed lol!
I had a very religious man over to my house yesterday, (he teaches some photography techniques) And he says OOOOHHHH a bird! and ran up, well Sookie screeched because the man came to his cage really fast... and then grumbled and said HI STUPID!!!!! I wanted to die! Good thing the man had a great sense of humor because he laughed so hard he had tears in his eyes lol. Sookie was so caught off gaurd, I think he just said the first thing that came to mind lol. It was cute though.
You've likely heard of Tequila Works for its work on charming adventure game, Rime. But the team also has a VR game on the way, and it's coming very soon.
The Invisible Hours, as the game is called, will launch on the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR (PSVR) on October 10th. The game is published by GameTrust, the publishing arm of US videogame retailing giant, GameStop.
The game is an intriguing murder mystery experience in which the player is invisible to the cast of characters surrounding them. You explore a mansion, following a series of interwoven stories in the search for answers. Events unfold in real time, meaning players can miss conversations between key players if they don't choose carefully about where to be at the right time.
This isn't just any old cast of characters though. For starters, the victim is world famous inventor, Nikola Tesla, and suspects include the likes of Thomas Edison and Sarah Bernhardt.
We got a first look at the game earlier in the year, and we liked what we saw. The Invisible Hours will be available for $29.99 both digitally and at retail.
Met Éireann has just issued a Status Red weather warning – its highest level.
The Wind Warning applies to Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick.
Schools across the region have been told by Government they should close tomorrow if the gales threaten parents or children as they are travelling to and from home.
“Wind gusts 130 to 150km/h possible,” the warning states, with “high onshore seas also”.
The warning was issued at 2pm today, and is valid until noon tomorrow.

Forecaster Evelyn Cusack said damage may be limited as this is the first major Atlantic system to hit Ireland this winter.
“We don't expect to be as bad as the major storm last February and in terms of damage it's always very difficult to forecast but we don't expect it to be stormed of the century,” she said.
The storm is expected to batter parts of the north-west, Donegal in particular, for up to 24 hours.
As it moved in from the south the Kinsale gas platform off Cork recorded a gust of 64 knots – 120km/h at 5pm.
Gust of 146KPH at Cork Airport! — Kildare Weather (@KildareMet) January 14, 2015
Met Éireann forecaster Gerald Fleming said that the west coast will be worst affected.
“For some parts of the country, particularly I think Galway, Clare, Limerick, this storm will be at its most ferocious tomorrow morning between the hours, typically, of 6am and 9am,” he said.
“[It] is a time when many people are out and about and so on, and when people get up in the morning, if they haven't been paying attention to the forecast, they may not anticipate what they're facing into when they head outside their front doors.
“So we do think it's important that people take note that this is potentially a dangerous storm.”

Status Red warnings from Met Éireann are relatively rare.
Describing what action should be taken in the event of a red warning, the Met Éireann website states: “Recipients take action to protect themselves and/or their properties.
“This could be by moving their families out of the danger zone temporarily; by staying indoors; or by other specific actions aimed at mitigating the effects of the weather conditions.”

Earlier this afternoon, the national forecaster issued new rainfall and wind warnings.
An Orange Wind Warning for Ireland forecast wind speeds of up to 130 km/h, highest in exposed areas, southerly, veering westerly, in direction.

The Status Yellow warning predicted up to 35mm of rainfall for Connacht, Donegal, Clare, Cork, Kerry and Limerick.
The warning is valid until 6pm tomorrow. A similar warning was issued this morning, valid until 11pm tonight.

A number of schools in rural parts of the country including Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal did not open today due to snow and education chiefs urged principals to consider closing tomorrow in the areas worst hit by storm force winds.
A spokeswoman for Donegal County Council which expects to experience some of the worst conditions urged people to exercise caution.
“Members of the public should not place themselves at risk on the road or on exposed areas like coasts or hills and should ask themselves if they really need to travel. It is likely that there will be some traffic disruption from fallen trees and localised flooding in areas,” she said.
Clare County Council, which suffered millions of euro worth of damage during repeated Atlantic storms last winter, opened an emergency call centre for people reporting fallen trees, blocked roads and flooding – 1890 252 943.
“While the entire county will be affected, the most extreme impacts are likely to be along the coastline. The advice is not to venture out or to drive on exposed roads while these conditions prevail,” a council spokesman said.
Forecasters warned the stormy conditions will continue into tomorrow morning. Winds will gradually ease during the afternoon and evening and there will be heavy and prolonged showers, Met Éireann said.
Sea area forecasts are warning of violent storm force 11 winds on Irish coasts.
Simon Coveney, Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, urged farmers and people working at sea to take all safety measures in the storm.
“2014 proved to be the worst year for farm accidents since 1992 with 30 deaths reported, while tragic incidents in our fishing industry in recent years resulted in the sad loss of many lives,” he said.
“It is important that these appalling figures focus our minds in respect of farm and fishery safety this year and particularly during adverse weather”.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said: “The advice to schools is that they should consider not opening where a status red weather warning related to wind is forecast to coincide with the periods during which students and staff would be expected to be travelling to and from school.”
Trains running between Athenry and Ennis were also suspended for a while but the biggest disruption hit Heuston Station in Dublin where an early morning train from Cork suffered mechanical faults at Newbridge. The knock-on effect saw all services out of the station severely delayed for a number of hours.
Senior officials from several Government departments met to examine the threat from the storm at the National Emergency Coordination Centre in Dublin.
Motorists were also being warned that melting snow and ice followed by heavy rains caused spot and localised flooding in parts of Clare, Galway and Mayo.
With the risk to power supplies in the storm, ESB Networks said the forecast suggested there will be a significant risk of blackouts.
“In the event of damage occurring we will assess the scale of the damage when it is safe to do so and develop a restoration plan based on prioritised power restoration needs,” a spokesman said.
ESB Networks said safety is paramount and warned customers not to approach or touch fallen or low-hanging wires and power lines.
The company said all staff are on stand-by to respond to warnings of fallen lines and additional staff from Northern Ireland Electricity and contracting firms will also be called in if needed.
The ESB Networks website, Twitter feed and Powercheck App will post regular updates of expected restoration times.
Tim O'Leary, countryside chairman of the Irish Farmers Association, called on all local authorities to work closely with farmers and communities to keep rural Ireland moving during the storm.
“The past 24 hours have been extremely challenging for farm families, particularly along the west coast of the country. Heavy snow showers and rapidly falling temperatures resulted in many roads becoming impassable,” he said.
Limerick City and County Council director of services, travel and transport, Paul Crowe, said the local authority is urging members of the public to be vigilant.
“We are advising the public to avoid making any unnecessary journeys as the strong winds are expected to continue into the night time hours,” Mr Crowe said.
“With the cold weather over the last number of days the Council has been putting its winter maintenance plan into action but with stormy conditions forecast we're advising motorists to exercise caution and to make themselves familiar with the Road Safety Authority guidelines on driving in difficult conditions which can be viewed on our website limerick.ie/council or rsa.ie.”
Bards from ancient times used to memorize entire books and histories. Now, we're reduced to having to check a cell phone to look up a 7-digit telephone number.
This fact comes via security company Kaspersky Labs. Its report, The Rise and Impact of Digital Amnesia, describes “Digital Amnesia: the experience of forgetting information that you trust a digital device to store and remember for you.”
“Across the United States, the study shows that an overwhelming number of consumers can easily admit their dependency on the Internet and devices as a tool for remembering,” the organization writes. “Almost all (91.2 percent) of those surveyed agreed that they use the Internet as an online extension of their brain. Almost half (44.0 percent) also admit that their smartphone serves as their memory–everything they need to recall and want to have easy access to is all on it.”
What's more, we actually like it that way, Kaspersky asserts. “When faced with a question, half of U.S. consumers would turn to the Internet before trying to remember and 28.9 percent would forget an online fact as soon as they had used it.”
Yes, it's true. People don't want to waste their valuable brain cells on a phone number that could be better used to keep track of the latest Jon Snow parentage theory on Game of Thrones.
And this isn't just a millennial phenomenon, either. “Contrary to general assumptions, Digital Amnesia is not only affecting younger digital natives–the study found that it was equally and some times more prevalent in older age groups,” Kaspersky writes. “For example, respondents aged 45 and older are more likely to head straight for the Internet for the answer to a question, and write the fact down or choose to forget an online fact once they've used it on the assumption that it will always be out there somewhere.”
This isn't because older people are less smart—it's because they just have so much more stuff to remember. “There seems to be some evidence that older individuals have trouble retrieving information because they have more information to sort through,” notes Dr. Kathryn Mills, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, in the study. “In theory, this could mean that ‘offloading' some of our information to a digital device could make it easier to recall the information we have retained.”
After all, isn't that the idea behind so many of today's computing concepts, ranging from enterprise content management (ECM) systems to big data? That the computer can keep much more of this stuff in its brain than we can? That way, we can spend our time using information, instead of remembering it.
People are even beginning to adapt to these “auxiliary brains.” A seminal paper published in Science in 2011 detailed research by Harvard and the Universities of Columbia and Wisconsin into memory and Internet use, Kaspersky notes. “The study showed that the way young people in the U.S. remembered information was changing as a result of being able to find information online: they retained fewer facts but could readily recall where the information was stored. The researchers called this ‘the Google effect.'”
But is this a bad thing? Not necessarily. Instead, we're just using technology to assist us in remembering in the same way that we use technology to help us with other things, writes Hermann Mauer in Communications of the ACM.
“We should not judge persons now and in the future without the technological tools they are using, whether those tools are built-in (pacemaker) or external (hearing aid, smartphone, reading software for visually challenged persons, tablet PCs, Google Glass),” Mauer writes. “We have long accepted this for physical properties: my grandfather was strong: he could carry 50kg 20 kilometres in four hours! Well, I can do better: I can carry 250kg 200 kilometres in two hours with my car.”
Instead, the ability to “outsource” our memory to devices and ECM software simply means we start using our minds in a new way, anthropologist Dr. Genevieve Bell, a vice-president at Intel and director of the company's Corporate Sensing and Insights Group, tells the Independent. “Being able to create a well-formed question is an act of intelligence, as you quickly work out what information you want to extract and identify the app to help achieve this,” she says. “To me, this suggests a level of engagement with the world that's not about dumbness.”
Now, if we could just keep from misplacing our phones.
Anthony Herrera returned to the practice field today for the first time since suffering a torn left anterior cruciate ligament last Nov. 21 against the Green Bay Packers at the Metrodome.
Herrera, the Vikings' starting right guard since November 2007, worked with the first team during group installation drills after being activated from the physically-unable-to-perform list. He had to pass a physical before being taken off that list. Herrera, who was wearing a protective wrap on his knee, declined to comment as he left the field, saying he had to go get treatment.
"We didn't anticipate him being on the field until maybe next week at the earliest, and the fact that he's out here a week earlier than we anticipated, that's a good sign," coach Leslie Frazier. Frazier said there is a chance Herrera could get a series on Saturday night in Seattle, depending on how things go this week in practice.
Herrera did not do any work in 11-on-11 drills during Monday's practice at Winter Park -- the Vikings broke camp in Mankato last Friday -- opening the door for Scott Kooistra and Ryan Cook to get reps. Cook replaced Herrera after he was injured last season.
That was interesting because Chris DeGeare had played left guard while Herrera was out. DeGeare started at that position in the Vikings' preseason opener Saturday night at Tennessee, but on Monday he was used at right tackle in the team drills.
"No, we're not taking [DeGeare] out of the mix [at right guard], but we want to be able to give him a chance to work some tackle along with Jon Cooper," Frazier said. "We're going to flop those guys a little bit and just see what kind of position flexibility they can give us and you know on that offensive line if you can find a couple guys that can do that, it just helps you numbers-wise when you come to game day. We're going to give Chris a chance to see how he does in that regard."
Cooper, the Vikings' backup center, actually will get work at guard and center now.
Asked how DeGeare looked on tape Saturday, Frazier said: "He actually graded OK. There were some things that he could do better, and I'm sure he would say the same. But overall, he did a pretty decent job. He'll get some other opportunities."
Frazier's intention is to leave Kooistra at tackle for the most part. That means the competition for right guard will be between Herrera, DeGeare and Cook.
Still on the sideline
Tight end Visanthe Shiancoe (hamstring) and linebacker Kenny Onatolu (foot) remained out of practice.
Onatolu is no longer wearing a walking boot on his left foot, but Frazier doesn't expect him to play until the third preseason game against Dallas.
Shiancoe likely will sit out again Saturday after straining his hamstring last week. "[We] just want to be cautious," Frazier said. "We'd like to take a look at the other guys. We kind of know where Shianc is. If it were a game situation, maybe, but no, preseason, we should be all right."
More injuries
Linebacker Heath Farwell (hamstring), offensive tackle Thomas Welch (glute) and defensive end D'Aundre Reed (strained calf) did not practice Monday. Rookie safety Mistral Raymond, coming off a hamstring pull suffered last week, was limited.
Etc.
Rhett Bomar did not play Saturday but Frazier said that wasn't because the team was taking disciplinary action against the quarterback after he was arrested for alleged drunken driving the previous week. “No, we intended to play him," Frazier said. "We want to play him, and hopefully we'll get him in the ballgame this coming weekend. Because we want to see him on tape and get a chance to evaluate him as well. We just didn't have the chance to get him in there.”
Christian Ponder worked with the second-team offense on Monday and Joe Webb was the third quarterback. Webb played after starter Donovan McNabb at Tennessee, but that will change against the Seahawks. Ponder will be second off the bench and Webb will be third.
Among the highlights of today's practice, which was conducted in shorts and shoulder pads: Ponder threw a pass over the middle in 7-on-7 that should have been intercepted by Ross Homan. The rookie linebacker dropped the ball. Bomar did throw a pick in the same drill, having his pass tipped by wide receiver Devin Aromashodu into the hands of linebacker Mark Washington. Kyle Rudolph made a nice catch of a Donovan McNabb pass down the left side.
Perception [official site], the horror game exploring the history of a spooky house through the ears of a blind woman with magical Daredevil echolocation, is now out. Our Adam already told us all Wot He Thinks of it last week, which is that it doesn't quite come together, but now you can actually buy and play it yourself and form your own opinions then, as appropriate, tell Adam to: 1) cram it; 2) keep on keeping on; or 3) you know, whatever.Perception stars Cassie, a young woman haunted by dreams of a spookhouse. Off she goes to Echo Bluff to poke around, coming to discover the stories of previous residents and meeting a g-g-g-ghost! or two.
Many of the folks from developers The Deep End Games previously worked at Irrational on the BioShocks. They helped fund Perception through a Kickstarter and, two years later, it's out. Here's a lump of Adam's thoughts on how it's turned out:
“Not creepy or scary enough to quite work as a horror game, and without the sense of investigation that would make it work as a mystery, Perception falls between two posts. Its premise is strong and the echolocation works well, but there simply isn't enough to do in that old house, other than knock on the walls and listen to tales of times gone by. It's a game that I wanted to like so much more than I do, partly because it's so visually appealing and partly because Cassie is such a likeable character. She deserves a better story for herself rather than to be an observer of other peoples' lives.”

It is early, but there have already been many reports of “voter fraud and voting machine vote flipping” in Wisconsin, all in the favor of Ted Cruz, which obviously points to corruption and cheating yet again by Ted Cruz and his slimy henchmen.
Wisconsin is not the first state where Ted Cruz won a surprising victory, and where, coincidentally, voter fraud has been highly suspected. Donald Trump is a brilliant man who surrounds himself with brilliant men and women. I trust he will find a way to expose this and combat it.

Trending: VIDEO: LOL! Stupid liberal Chelsea Clinton wishing her granny had access to abortion. I abhor abortion, but I have to really think about this one
It is very interesting that the poll most relied upon by political pundits, RCP, showed the poll they most recently cited, American Research Group, giving Trump a 10-point advantage. This is the most recent polling done of likely Wisconsin voters, who were surveyed April 1 to April 3.
Combine American Research Group's findings with the real-time polling of Isidewith.com, and their is plenty of room for suspicion, given the fact that Ted Cruz won the Wisconsin primary by over 13 points, on the strength of his support in urban areas.
Huh? Ted Cruz, a self-proclaimed ultra-right wing conservative and evangelical Christian, sweeping the typically left-wing, ultra-liberal, secular urban precincts? Really? It is interesting to note that urban areas are where voter fraud is typically discovered. It is equally interesting to note that Donald Trump swept nearly all of the rural precincts in Wisconsin, where voter fraud has historically been non-existent.
In the video below, Bill Still, reports the apparent cheating by Cruz in Wisconsin. By all means, if you can, donate a small amount to Bill Still's site. His work is tremendous!
From Bill Still, Still Report
Amidst calls of voter fraud and voting machine vote flipping, Ted Cruz has won the Wisconsin primary – 48.3% for Cruz, 35.1% for Trump and 14.1% for Kasich.
However, this is a new day and there is still very good news for Trumpsters, so hang with me.
Cruz took 33 convention delegates and Trump – so far – took only 3. However, there are 6 yet to be assigned. Here is the latest count from this morning's New York Times.
Trump with 739, Cruz with 502, and Kasich with 143. Interestingly, suddenly, Rubio is reappearing back into the picture, so Rubio with 171.
First of all, 171 delegates is going to be a big, looming block at the end of all this. Secondly, Rubio is probably still — in the mind of the GOP establishment — the most viable alternative to Trump, should Trump not reach 1237 delegates on the first ballot.
In addition, according to the Green Papers – perhaps the most authoritative delegate counters – Trump is going to pick up an additional 10 delegates once the states sort out their delegate counts. That would put him at 749, 50% more delegates than Cruz.
This is the Wisconsin county map. As usual, Trump took all the rural areas, and Cruz – acting more like an urban Democrat vote getter than a “consistent conservative” scooped up the more urban areas.
Of course, urban areas are typically the target of voter fraud because that's where the most concentrated votes are, and that's where politicians tend to be more corrupt.
Many of the rural counties voted for Trump with 30 point spreads or more over Cruz.
Now just hold on, we are coming to the good news for this morning.
There are only 773 delegates yet to be won, and after the next round of primaries in 13 days, Trump will most likely be in the 920 to 950 range. And here is the good news. According to this morning's New York Times, it is more than likely that Trump will be able to achieve a 1st ballot victory with some to spare after the June 7 primaries which include New Jersey and California.
So relax, be happy. God's in total control of this process, and Mr. Trump has already pledged to pivot off this defeat and act more presidential.
BAGHDAD - Tens of thousands of Iraqis surged into the streets Friday in at least a dozen demonstrations across the country, storming provincial buildings, forcing local officials to resign, freeing prisoners and otherwise demanding more from a government they only recently had a chance to elect.
At least 23 protesters were killed as Iraqis braved security forces to vent shared frustrations at the nearest government official. Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds and Christians, they shouted for simple dignities made more urgent by war - adequate electricity, clean water, a decent hospital, a fair shot at a job.
"I have demands!" Salma Mikahil, 48, cried out in Baghdad's Tahrir Square, as military helicopters and snipers looked down on thousands of people bearing handmade signs and olive branches signifying peace. "I want to see if Maliki can accept that I live on this," Mikahil said, waving a 1,000-dinar note, worth less than a dollar, toward Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's offices. "I want to see if his conscience accepts it."
The protests - billed as Iraq's "Day of Rage" - represented a new sort of conflict for a population that has been menaced by sectarian militias and suicide bombers. Now, many wondered whether they would have to add to the list of enemies their own government, whose security forces beat and shot at protesters and journalists Friday and left hundreds injured.
Six people were killed in Fallujah and six others in Mosul, with the other deaths reported in five separate incidents around the country, according to officials and witnesses. The reports attributed most casualties to security forces who opened fire.
The demonstrators who sparked the crackdown were calling for reform, not revolution, although there were mini-examples of the latter - hyper-local versions of the recent revolts in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. Crowds forced the resignation of the governor of the southern province of Basra and the entire city council of Fallujah and chased away the governor of Mosul, the brother of the speaker of parliament, who was also there and fled, too.
The protests began peacefully but grew more aggressive. Angry crowds seized a local police station in Kirkuk, set fire to a provincial office in Mosul and rattled fences around the local governate offices in Tikrit, prompting security forces to open fire with live bullets. At least three people were reported killed in the Tikrit area and three others in Kirkuk.
By sundown in Baghdad, security forces were spraying water cannons and exploding sound bombs to disperse protesters, chasing several through streets and alleyways and killing at least three, according to a witness.
Two people were also reported killed in Kurdistan, in the north.
The day's events posed a unique challenge for the Obama administration, which has struggled to calibrate its responses to the protests rolling across the Middle East and North Africa but has a particular stake in the stability of the fledgling democracy it helped usher in.
Analysts said Friday's developments were at best awkward for the United States.
"Obama wants to convey that 'Yes, Iraq has a number of problems that need to be addressed, but the country is on the right track,'" said Joost Hiltermaan, deputy director for the International Crisis Group's Middle East program. "You can't possibly say, 'Iraq is in a crisis, and by the way, we're leaving.' "
The United States is set to complete the withdrawal of all its troops from Iraq by the end of the year.
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad played down Friday's violence, as well as the draconian measures Maliki took to stifle turnout.
Iraq's security forces "generally have not used force against peaceful protesters," said Aaron Snipe, an embassy spokesman. "We support the Iraqi people's right to freely express their political views, to peacefully protest and seek redress form their government. This has been our consistent message in Iraq and throughout the region."
The turnout Friday appeared to surprise many of the demonstrators, coming as it did after a curfew on cars and even bicycles forced people to walk, often miles, to participate. There were also pleas - some described them as threatening - from Maliki and Shiite clerics, including the populist Moqtada al-Sadr, to stay home.
Sadr, whose Mahdi Army is blamed for some of the worst sectarian violence of the war, is now part of Maliki's governing coalition and attempting to position himself as both insider and outsider. Sadr's power lies in his rare ability to call hundreds of thousands into the streets, and analysts said he is perhaps concerned about losing his impoverished urban followers to the new and still only vaguely unified protest movement .
By mid-morning in Baghdad, people were walking toward Tahrir Square along empty streets fortified with soldiers in Humvees, snipers on rooftops and mosque domes and checkpoints with X-ray equipment that might reveal a suicide vest.
Young and old, some missing legs and arms, some chanting old slogans of the Mahdi Army, the protesters passed crumbling high-rise apartment buildings webbed with electrical wires hooked to generators. At times, the air smelled like sewage.
"Bring electricity!" they shouted, and "No to corruption!"
By afternoon, several thousand people were milling around the square, which is next to a bridge leading to the heavily guarded international zone housing the government's offices. Overnight, security forces had hauled in huge blast walls to block the bridge from protesters, who nonetheless managed to hoist a rope around one of them and pull it down.
"As you can see, they are hiding behind this wall!" shouted Sbeeh Noman, a white-haired engineer who said he walked 12 miles to reach the square and was now heading for the bridge. "The government is afraid of the nation. They have found out that the people have the real power."

Modern architecture has often been accused of encroaching on wildlife habitats – but McGregor Coxall just unveiled a new project that's literally for the birds. The world's first migratory “Bird Airport” is designed to convert a landfill in Lingang, China into a wetland bird sanctuary
Every year, more than 50 million birds journey from the Antarctic along the East Asian-Australian Flyway (EAAF), but the route is increasingly threatened to due to coastal urbanization. Today, 1 in 5 globally endangered waterbirds fly this route as their population rapidly decreases.
Related: 1.5 billion birds disappear from North America's skies
To address the problem, the Port of Tianjin called on international designers to create a wetland sanctuary for migrating birds. McGregor Coxall's Bird Airport includes 60 hectares of wetland park, where birds will be able to stop, refuel, and breed on their way through the flyway. Renewable energy will be used to irrigate the wetlands with recycled waste water and harvested rain.
Adrian McGregor, CEO and lead designer of McGregor Coxall explains the inspiration behind the project, “The earth's bird flyways are a wonder of the natural world. The proposed Bird Airport will be a globally significant sanctuary for endangered migratory bird species whilst providing new green lungs for the city of Tianjin.”
The city of Tianjin will enjoy many benefits from the new green infrastructure. The proposal calls for plenty of park space – including walking and cycling paths along a 7 km network of recreational urban forest trails. Construction on the bird airport is slated to begin late 2017, and the project will be completed in 2018.
I have an application using TWebBrowser component to allow viewing of Adobe PDF documents within the application. This approach is really pretty simple: when a user of the application has Adobe Reader (/Acrobat) installed, by default any PDF documents will get open inside Internet Explorer (and therefore inside TWebBrowser) – neat and simple way to provide easy PDF preview in a Delphi application (until you go 64-bit…).
Another approach would be to directly use Reader's ActiveX and place it in a container on a form. This approach requires knowing the name of the ActiveX (“acropdf.dll” or alike) and either creating a component out of it (to be drag-dropped to a form) or instantiating the object dynamically.
All this works without any issues as long as you compile your Delphi application as WIN32 (x86) applications – those can work both on x86 and x64 Windows.
Moving to x64
The time has come for this application to be upgraded from 32-bit to 64-bit.
The task of adding WIN64 build type was really simple (Delphi has this feature from XE2 version) – just added a target platform (64-bit Windows) and recompiled – pure 64-bit version ready!
Run the application, all looks good … test the TWebBrowser functionality and … bam!
PDFs no longer open in TWebBrowser!
Rather, Adobe Reader gets started and the PDF loads outside of the application – not something I would expect.
Even worse: for some users only a black “x” and an empty page appear inside the WebBrowser control.
For some other users a more tricky dialog gets displayed:
For some other users all works as expected!
What's happening!?
x86 vs x64 vs ActiveX, DLLs and the Rest
What happened here is related to the following: 64-bit Windows is capable of running both 64-bit and 32-bit applications. This is, of course, why my 32-bit application was running without any issues on 64-bit Windows. If the application uses any external DLLs or ActiveX components (as here is the case: TWebBrowser using Reader's ActiveX plug-in to display PDFs) all those external libraries must also be 32-bit compiled. Again, since 64-bit Windows will run both 32-bit and 64-bit applications – all is working.
However, when you compile a true 64-bit Delphi application, if you are using any external DLLs – all those should also be 64-bit. If your application process is running in a 64-bit address space, the ActiveX/DLL's address space must match.
There's a lot of info about this topic available on the Internet so I won't go into more details here.
Issues With Adobe Reader Versions and TWebBrowser
So what's happening? Why is the 64-bit version of my application running without any issues for some users and runs with issues (does not, better to say) for others?
All the problems above are related to the version of Adobe Reader my users have on their 64-bit Windows!
Until version 11.0.7 Adobe Reader ActiveX control used to handle PDF documents display in Internet Explorer (and therefore TWebBrowser) was available only as a 32-bit version. Since 32-bit add-ons cannot be loaded in 64-bit process (IE) the PDF does not get loaded with “weird” side-results (mentioned above).
Version 11.0.7 introduces 64-bit add-on and users having this version installed will see no problems – a PDF document will load up inside the TWebBrowser as the plug-in being used is 64-bit!
If you browse the following location “C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Acrobat\ActiveX” you will see two DLLs used: “AcroPDF.dll” and “AcroPDF64.dll” – where the latter is obviously the 64-bit.
So all should be fine, but I still had one problem to solve…
The IE's EPM mode dialog above is what also hit me. I was not sure how to fix this one as I have Reader 11.0.10 installed (the latest version of it when this post was written) – therefore 64-bit plug-in available for IE. IE's EPM mode was disabled, yet the problem was here.
After a few stressy hours I've finally located and fixed the issue. The thing is that I also have Adobe Acrobat PRO installed (version X) – this one is 32-bit. IE was using Acrobat to handle PDF display. Had to change this by going to Adobe Acrobat, Edit – Preferences – General.
Select Adobe Reader XI as the default PDF handler in a web browser. Apply. Start the application (64-bit), navigate to a PDF in a TWebBrowser – everything works as expected, finally!
Go or No Go?
To summarize: if you have an application using the WebBrowser control to display PDF documents you (users of your application) first need to have Adobe Reader or Adobe Acrobat (or other software like FoxIt providing IE add-on) installed.
If you build a 32-bit version of your application – everything should work as expected.
If you build a 64-bit version of your application – users would need to have at least Adobe Reader XI (11.0.7) version and everything should work as expected.
If you have both 32-bit (Acrobat X) and 64-bit (Reader XI) – make sure the latter is the one handing PDF display in your 64-bit Delphi application using TWebBrowser.

<But the Soviets tricked Kennedy into changing the policy (by using shaming tactics), so America would bring in 3rd worlders instead of Europeans. I used to respect Kennedy, until I learned this little-known history.> Here's the link:
Kenneth S Rogoff (kibitz #373739) And this was corroborated by <The Kingfish> . But it was <Ted> not <John> ! Of course, I was thinking <John> , which was an error I freely admitted. (Never see any Lefties doing this, except <saffuna> on rare occasions.) Thus, I did NOT make an incorrect statement, since I didn't give a first name in my written post, and didn't mention I was thinking <John> until AFTER <saffuna> blundered his search. So he still cannot blame me for his lame search effort. Conclusion? Yes, I am <smelling of roses> . Admittedly, I did get lucky in this case, by not being specific. So it was a rare instance of me NOT being a devious mastermind, to answer your question. But sometimes it is better to be lucky than good. And since <Ted> Kennedy sponsored the legislation to make the change (according to <The Kingfish> ) then yes, of course, <when someone can't verify it, they are the idiot> . Since it was still a Kennedy, <saffuna> should have found it. I bet if he told us what his precise search wording was, we all would have a laugh.

With the end of summer fast approaching comes another year of rising college tuition costs and looming student loans.
College tuition has increased over the past several decades, but in the last 10 years the average cost of tuition for four-year public colleges and universities has grown at a lower rate than previous decades. Still, the price tag for college is not cheap. For the average four-year public institution, tuition can cost about $9,650, according to College Board. The average tuition total for private non-profit institutions is more than triple that at $33,480.
These high tuition costs have inevitably led to more students taking out loans in order to afford their education. Across the United States, there are more than 44 million student loan borrowers who have accrued approximately $1.3 trillion in student loan debt, according to Forbes.
The student loan industry is a major player in money in politics, but was not as active in 2016 as it has been in the past. For the 2016 election cycle, student loan companies gave just over $982,000 in contributions to federal candidates, parties and outside groups. The industry reported more than $1 million in contributions for both the 2014 and 2012 cycles.
Roughly three-quarters of the industry's contributions for 2016 went to Republican candidates and parties. The student loan industry has allocated more of its contributions to Republicans than Democrats in every cycle since 1996.
The top three student loan companies making campaign contributions in 2016 were College Loan Corp with $668,000 donated, Navient Corp with almost $283,000, and NelNet Inc with just under $168,000. All three companies gave the majority of their contributions to Republican and conservative candidates and parties.
Student loan companies are even more active in the lobbying world, spending more than $4.4 million on lobbying efforts in 2016. The top lobbying client by far in 2016 was Navient Corp with more than $2 million spent. Other major lobbying spenders for the industry last year were NelNet Inc and SLM Corp with $620,000 and $570,000, respectively.
Last year these companies mainly lobbied on issues related to student loans, particularly federal credit programs, student borrowing and loan servicing, IRS private debt collection and Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which aims to make grants and other benefits available to eligible students seeking post-secondary education. So far in 2017, student loan companies have spent roughly $3.6 million on lobbying.
Student loan companies aren't the only ones getting political — colleges and universities are, too. For the 2016 election cycle, the education industry had a record-high contribution total of almost $81 million. Nearly all of this money is donated by school employees, such as professors, since most non-profit educational institutions do not have political action committees. Of the contributions to political candidates and parties, Democrats received 86 percent — the most significant liberal lean in the industry's history. Since 1990, the education industry has never given less than 58 percent of its contributions to Democrats, with an overall average of 77 percent going to the left.
The higher education institutions with affiliates who gave the most money during the 2016 election were the University of California system (roughly $4.4 million), Stanford University (almost $2.3 million) and Harvard University (more than $1.6 million). Every university among the sector's top 20 donors made at least 83 percent of its contributions to Democrats.
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton received the most money from the education industry in 2016 by far, with a total of approximately $23.7 million. Her primary challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came in second with almost $5.5 million, while her general election opponent Donald Trump was further down the list of top recipients at No. 8, with a total of about $778,000.
In recent years, the education industry's lobbying spending has been on a downward slope, and 2016 was no exception. The industry's lobbying total was about $74.4 million — over $3.6 million less than its 2015 total and $35 million short of the industry's record-high lobbying total from 2010.
Last year, the biggest lobbying clients in the education industry were the Association of American Medical Colleges (more than $2.8 million), Apollo Education Group (about $1.4 million) and the education-related subsidiaries of Warburg Pincus (just over $1.1 million). The top education-related issues these groups focused on included cuts to graduate and professional student loan benefits, global health learning opportunities, financial aid (including Pell Grants), campus sexual assault and post 9/11 G.I. bill benefits.

Clinton Foundation and PepsiCo Launch Strategic Partnership to Spur Social and Economic Development in Emerging Markets
Inaugural Project Focused on Improving Livelihood of Smallholder Cashew Farmers in Maharashtra, India
PepsiCo to Source Vitamin-Rich Cashew Fruit to Further Enhance Nutritional Quality of Juice Products in India
New York, NY— The Clinton Foundation and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) announced a strategic partnership to spur social and economic development in emerging markets through a unique social enterprise model. The partnership's inaugural project was launched in Maharashtra, India with an agriculture initiative to source vitamin-rich cashew fruit from smallholder farmers, an arrangement that is expected to create an important new ingredient supply for PepsiCo's local juice business while simultaneously improving the livelihood of thousands of cashew growers in the region.
Through the Clinton Foundation's Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership model, founded by President Bill Clinton and philanthropist Frank Giustra, this initiative will apply modern agricultural techniques to improve cashew farming practices, boost yield and productivity, and increase income for local smallholder farmers. It will also scale up and strengthen India's cashew supply chain to build the future potential of a domestic and export market.
Most cashew farmers in this area of India farm on less than one hectare of land and live below the poverty line. The Clinton Foundation's Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership uses market-driven models to improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers by providing training, facilitating the purchase of their harvest, and handling their distribution and logistics. The approach has been designed for replication in value chains throughout the world and is currently catalyzing similar supply chain enterprises in Latin America and Haiti.
Cashew fruit – which typically goes unused by most cashew nut farmers – is high in nutritional value. It is rich in potassium and contains as much as five times the vitamin C as an orange and 50 times the vitamin C as an apple. PepsiCo plans to use cashew fruit juice as one of the ingredients in some of its blended fruit juice products in India.
“Committed partners like PepsiCo demonstrate the tremendous impact that social enterprises and the private sector can make when they work together to solve business problems that also advance social good,” said President Clinton.
“This initiative embodies Performance with Purpose – PepsiCo's recognition that our success is inextricably linked to society's success,” said Indra K. Nooyi, PepsiCo's Chairman and CEO. “Sustainable agriculture is critical to PepsiCo's supply chain and we have a long history of working with local farmers around the world in ways that strengthen our business and the communities in which we operate. This partnership is a great example of aligning business and societal priorities, and we see great potential in continued collaboration with the Clinton Foundation.”
The program's first India cashew harvest is currently underway. The fruit will be sourced from more than 2,000 smallholder farmers in 2014, with plans to scale the opportunity to as many as 15,000 over the next five years. PepsiCo India plans to begin incorporating the fruit into some of its blended juice products starting in Spring 2015.
“The Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership's unique approach has the potential to generate meaningful impact in the developing world. We believe that by creating, scaling and replicating social enterprises in selected value chains we can help disadvantaged populations work themselves out of poverty,” said Frank Giustra.

Earlier in the year, I wrote a guide to ‘Brewery Creek' which got both positive and negative feedback. Of course, regardless of the criticism, I couldn't just stop there as there are many other breweries that need tackling. So here's part two: a complete guide to the breweries located in the neighbourhood known as ‘yeast van' (I hate that term). Agree with me or not, here we go.
One of the newest kids on the block, Andina really isn't hard to miss with their giant yellow exterior and mural. They focus on pairing flavours of South America with the West Coast.
Top contenders:
Ay Ay Ay Pale Ale- It's tasty and has hints of grapefruit and pine.
Mapale Milk Stout- This isn't always available, but when it is, it's a popular choice among the crowd.
Eats:
Honestly this is where Andina shines. They do a rotating ceviche every day with plantain chips, and they make really freaking good empanadas! Eat here, it's way better than brewery food should be.
Don't bother with:
I'm sorry but I absolutely hate the Maraca PassionFruit Black IPA. Hate is a harsh word, and one I don't often say in reference to beer, but yes, I HATE IT.
Top contenders:
Parklife Passionfruit Ale- This beer is delicious and a perfect summer sipper. Unfortunately it is seasonal, so you'll only see it during the summer.
Russian Imperial Stout- Another seasonal release, but fortunately during the winter months so you can switch between Parklife and this; it's a bold stout at 9.5% and deceptively easy to drink.
ESB- A strong contender for a West Coast/British ESB. It's a solid beer that's available year round.
Eats:
Bomber doesn't do food, so grab some food somewhere else.
Don't bother with:
Bomber IPA- Simply because there are better IPA's in this list. Including one that's right next door at Off The Rail.
Callister is a unique brewery; not only do they have some great rotating exhibits of local artists but they also operate as a co-working space for independent brewers (like former resident Boombox Brewing), meaning you get some very unique beers coming out of here.
Top contenders:
Zwirbelbart Dunkelweizen- This is a good beer and a great Dunkel.
Any IPA- Callister does a great job with their IPA's, and if you're lucky, a double IPA will be on tap.
Any guest tap- Obviously this is a bit of a crapshoot, but I'd be remiss if I didn't recommend the brewers being featured at Callister as it's small batch and experimental.
Eats:
Nothing more than your typical pepperoni sticks and cheese breads.
Don't bother with:
The taps rotate so often, bad beers don't have much of a chance of sticking around.
One of the smallest breweries in Vancouver, Doan's makes up for it with character. They regularly have lego nights, there's an arcade and board games to keep you entertained in the small space.
Top contenders:
Altbier- This German style pale ale is complex and drinkable with a nice subtle hint of German hops.
Kolsch- Crisp, clean and easy to drink. Also very easy to recommend.
Eats:
There are some vegan/vegetarian snacks, but nothing substantial.
Don't bother with:
Doan's only has four core beers, you can do a flight and basically try everything.
Italian inspired in both decor and brewing, Luppolo is another fresh contender to the brewing scene that has already made a strong impression (they won the best new brewery in the Georgia Straight).
Top contenders:
Farmhouse Ale- This ale combines the best of the West Coast with Belgian style Farmhouse brewing to make something drinkable and complex.
Saison- Another very easy to drink, but more complex than expected, offering. Luppolo does an excellent job with lighter fare beers.
Eats:
Italian snacks like olives, meats and cheeses are always a good choice, as are the Piadina flatbread sandwiches. On the weekends, the Focaccia is excellent.
Don't bother with:
Robust Porter- As mentioned above, Luppolo is strongest when working with farmhouse, saisons, sours, etc. The porter isn't bad, but not their best.
Located right down the street from Bomber brewing, Off the Rail might be small, but they are cranking out some quality beer and have a very bright and open space to enjoy a few pints.
Top contenders:
Classic Pale Ale- Rather than a West Coast pale, this is brewed in the traditional English style and is excellent.
Raj Mahal India Ale- Super creative with notes of lemongrass and kaffir lime. Don't miss this if it's on tap.
Belt Up ESB- Another classic English style beer, this bitter has a nice earthy malt with just enough bitterness to it.
Eats:
Typical beer snacks that you'll find across other breweries as well.
Don't bother with:
East Bound Nut Brown- A little too much nutty flavour for my taste.
Arguably one of the biggest craft breweries in Vancouver, Parallel 49 recently renovated their tap room and are constantly pairing up with other brewers to release limited edition collab brews.
Top contenders:
P49 Craft Lager- One of the best lagers in the province. It's clean drinking without washing out subtle tastes.
187 on an Undercover Hop- Not only is this Imperial IPA high in alcohol at 10%, it also hits you hard with an explosion of hops.
Wobbly Pop Pale Ale- Liked this pale ale way more than expected.
Eats:
Fish tacos and fried chicken & waffles from the indoor food truck, nuff said.
Don't bother with:
Orale Tequila Gose- Something about it doesn't work for me, might be the strong tequila taste.
Ruby Tears Red Ale- It's just kind of a boring beer.
Bet you didn't know that Vancouver's oldest microbrewery was in the seedy Patricia hotel? Yep, Pat's Pub has been around for over 100 years, and brews their own beer.
Top contenders:
Pat's Classic Lager- Vienna style lager that is actually pretty damn good.
Eats:
Go with Pat's classic burger, 7oz of fresh beef on a kaiser bun.
Don't bother with:
Anything else; you're here for the lager really.
Postmark lives in the Settlement Building which has the trifecta of a craft brewery, winery and kitchen all in one. It's a beautiful spot to hang out, and there's pretty much something for everyone.
Top contenders:
Postmark Stout- This is one of the lightest stouts you'll find, and it's delicious to boot.
Spruce Tip- I quite like this beer, a crisp Golden Ale brewed with Cascade hops and conditioned with fresh Vancouver Island Spruce Tips.
ISA- A very crushable beer that has the taste of a proper IPA with a much lower ABV.
Eats:
Belgard Kitchen is very good, you'll find a lot of options. Come here for brunch and try the bread pudding french toast, it's ridiculous.
Don't bother with:
Raspberry ale- I'd go for the Bomber passionfruit ale before the raspberry, but I'll drink it.
Top contenders:
Old Jalopy Pale Ale- An absolute must-try. This beer is so fantastic as a representation of a classic English pale ale. There's a reason it continues to win award after award.
Lazy D'Haze IPA- A Northeast style hazy IPA, super juicy and super delicious.
Dive Bomb Dark Ale- This dark ale is light and refreshing. Flavours of caramel, toffee, chocolate and nuts.
Eats:
Mixed nuts.
Don't bother with:
Amarillo Sour- Sorry but this lacto kettle sour just doesn't do it for me.
Storm Brewing is that weird uncle everybody has; it produces great craft beer, but bring your friends to this garage-style brewery and they may think you're crazy. They'll change their mind after a few samples (which are free!).
Top contenders:
Basil IPA- Can't speak highly enough of this beer; if you like basil, you'll love this IPA
Black Plague Stout- One of their staples, it's a very good stout that is used as a base for a lot of their experimentations.
Pineapple Pilsner/Jalapeno Pilsner- Toss up between these two, both are very different from one another, but the fresh additions of pineapple or jalapeno make for an interesting pilsner.
Eats:
There is no food, and you don't want to eat here anyway (you'll understand).
Don't bother with:
Pizza Pilsner- Look some lines just aren't meant to be crossed.
Imperial Flanders Sour Ale- This one's tricky, as I actually really do like the Flanders, however it is SO puckeringly sour it's hard to recommend to anyone but a diehard sour fan.
Strange Fellows is all about embracing the weird, and to that end, they've taken a dedicated focus on beers with wild yeast, sours and barrel aging. Many of their best beers come around once/twice a year.
Top contenders:
Jongleur Wit- A nice and refreshing wit beer that works really well as a mainstay for the brewery.
Roxanne Sour- Made with fresh raspberries this sour is excellent but only comes around every so often.
Popinjay Sour- Same as the Roxanne, it's a rare sour that really shines.
Eats:
Another stop with the standard bar snacks.
Don't bother with:
Talisman Pale Ale- Like I said, Strange Fellows is best at the weird, so this pale ale is too ‘normal' to really stand out from the rest.
A massive tasting room compared to its neighbours, Strathcona has a cool vibe and has tried to set itself apart by focusing on more malt forward beer.
Top contenders:
British IPA- Softer hops than the West Coast counterparts, it's a great IPA that shouldn't be overlooked.
Strathcona Gold- Honestly where else are you going to get craft beer in a 40oz bottle?
Cherry High- A new addition to the lineup; made with sour cherries it's not as sour as you'd think and very, very drinkable.
Eats:
Made to order think crust pizzas, the funghi is pretty damn good.
Don't bother with:
Strathcona Beach- I'm probably going to get shit for this one, as radlers are all the rage right now, but this lemon mandarin radler is just too much like juice. I like tasting the beer in my radler.

Letter from Italian anarchist Camillo Berneri to anarchists in the Spanish Government during the revolution.
Dear Comrade,
It was my intention to address myself to all you comrade ministers, but once the pen was in my hand, I addressed myself spontaneously to you alone and I did not wish to go against this instinctive impulse.
The fact that I am not always in agreement with you neither astonishes you nor irritates you, and you have shown yourself cordially oblivious to criticisms which it would almost always have been fair, because it is human, to consider as unjust and excessive. This is not a minor quality in my eyes, and it bears witness to the anarchist nature of our mind. It is a certainty that effectively compensates, as far as my natural friendship is concerned for the ideological peculiarities which you have often revealed in your articles in your very personal style and in your speeches of admirable eloquence.
I could not sit back and accept the identity that you claimed between Bakunist anarchism and the federalist Republicanism of Pi y Margall. I cannot pardon you for having written "that in Russia it was not Lenin the true builder of Russia, but Stalin in fact, the effective spirit, etc." And I applauded Voline's reply in 'Terre Libre' to your entirely false claims about the Russian anarchist movement.
But it is not about that that I wish to talk with you. On these matters, and indeed on others, I hope one day or another to talk to you personally. If I address you in public, it is about matters that are infinitely more serious, to remind you of the enormous responsibilities, of which you are perhaps not aware because of your modesty
In your speech of 3rd January, you said,
"The anarchists have come into the Government in order to prevent the Revolution from deviating from its course and in order to pursue it beyond the war, and also in order to oppose all possibility of dictatorial endeavours, wherever they should come from."
Well then, comrade, in April, after three months of collaborationist experience, we find ourselves face to face with a situation in the course of which serious actions are taking place, while other, worse ones are taking shape.
Where, as in the Basque country, in the Levant and in Castille, our movement is not imposed by grass-roots strength, in other words by vast ranks of unionists and by the preponderant adherence of the masses, the counter-revolution is oppressing people and threatens to crush everything. The Government is at Valencia and it is from there that assault guards are setting out, destined to disarm the revolutionary cells formed for defence. One calls to mind Casas-Viejas while thinking of Vilanesa . It is the civil guards and the assault guards who are retaining their arms; it is they too who in the rear must control the 'uncontrollable,' in other words disarm the revolutionary cells equipped with a few rifles and a few revolvers. This happens while the internal front has not been liquidated. This happens during the course of a civil war in which every surprise is possible and in regions where the front is very close and extremely jagged is not mathematically certain. This, while a political distribution of arms appears clearly, tending to arm only in strict necessity (strict necessity, which we hope will appear adequate) the Aragon Front, the armed guard of agrarian collectivisation in Aragon and buttress of Catalonia, that Iberian Ukraine. You are in a government that has offered France and Britain advantages in Morocco, whereas, since July 1936, it would have been necessary to proclaim of officially the political autonomy of Morocco. I can imagine what you, anarchist, must think of this affair which is as disgraceful as it is stupid; but I believe that the time has come to make it known that you and the other anarchist ministers are not in agreement as regards the nature and the purport of such propositions.
24th October 1936, I wrote in 'Guerra di Classe':
"The operational base of the Fascist army is Morocco. We must intensify our propaganda in favour of Moroccan autonomy throughout the pan-Islamic area of influence. We must dictate to Madrid unambiguous declarations announcing the abandonment of Morocco and the protection of Moroccan autonomy. France would anxiously envisage the possibility of insurrectionary repercussions in North Africa and Syria; Great Britain would see the movements for self-rule in Egypt and among Arabs in Palestine growing stronger. We must exploit such anxieties by means of a policy which threatens to unleash revolt throughout the Arab world.
"For such a policy we need money and we need urgently to send agitators and organisers as emissaries to all the centres of Arab migration, into all the frontier zones of French Morocco. On the fronts in Aragon, the Centre, the Asturias and Andalusia a few Moroccans would be enough to fulfil the role of propagandists (through the radio, tracts, etc.)."
It follows that one cannot simultaneously guarantee British and French interests in Morocco and carry on with insurrectionary work. Valencia is continuing the policies of Madrid. This must change. And to change it, one must state all one's own thoughts clearly and strongly, because in Valencia there are influences acting which tends towards treating with Franco.
Jean Zyromski wrote in 'Populaire' of 3rd March:
"The manoeuvres are visible and they are aiming at the conclusion of a peace which, in reality, would signify not only the halting of the Spanish Revolution, but also the annulment of the social conquests already achieved.
"Neither Caballero nor Franco, such would be the formula which would express briefly a conception which exists, and I am not sure that it does not have the favour of certain political, diplomatic and even governmental circles in Britain and also in France."
These influences, these manoeuvres explain different obscure points: for example the inactivity of the loyalist fleet. The concentration of troops coming from Morocco, the acts of piracy against 'Canaries' end 'Balearics,' the capture of Malaga are the consequences of this inactivity. And the war is not finished! If Prieto is incapable and indolent, why tolerate him? If Prieto is bound-by a policy that makes him paralyse the fleet, why not denounce this policy?
You anarchist ministers, you make eloquent speeches and you write brilliant articles, but it is not with speeches and articles that one wins the war and defends the Revolution. The former can be won and the latter can be defended by allowing us to pass from the defensive to the offensive. The strategy of holding our position cannot last for ever. The problem cannot be resolved by throwing out orders: general mobilisation, arms to the Front, sole command, popular army etc. etc. The problem can be resolved by achieving immediately what can be achieved.
The 'Toulouse Dispatch' of 17th January wrote,
"The main preoccupation of the Minister of the Interior is with re-establishing the authority of the State over that of the groups and over that of the uncontrollable whatever their origin."
It follows that when for months they try to annihilate the 'uncontrollables', they cannot resolve the problem of the liquidation of the 'Fifth Column .' The suppression of the internal front has as its primary condition activity aimed at investigation and repression which can only be accomplished by tried and tested revolutionaries. An internal policy of collaboration between the classes and of flattery towards the middle classes leads inevitably to tolerance towards politically ambiguous elements. The Fifth Column is composed not only of elements belonging to Fascist bodies, but also of all the malcontents who desire a moderate republic. Now, it is these latter elements who profit from the tolerance of the hunters of the 'uncontrollables'.
The liquidation of the internal front was a condition of full and radical activity by the Defence Committees set up by the CNT and the UGT.
We are assisting in the infiltration into the controlling ranks of the popular army of ambiguous elements without offering guarantees of political and union organisation. The committees and political delegates of the militias were exercising a beneficial control, which, today, is weakened by the predominance of strictly military systems of advancement and promotion. We must strengthen these committees and these delegates.
We are assisting the new situation which could have disastrous consequences, a situation in which whole battalions are commanded by officers who do not enjoy the esteem and affection of the soldiers. This situation is grave because the value of the Spanish militia-men is directly proportional to the confidence enjoyed by their own commander. It is therefore necessary to re-establish the system of direct election and the right of dismissal by those below.
A grave error has been committed by accepting authoritarian formulae, not because they are such from the point of view of their form; but because they contain tremendous errors and political aims that have nothing to do with the necessities of the war.
I had the chance to talk to senior Italian French and Belgian officers and I ascertained that they give a clear indication of knowing the real necessities of discipline, a much more modern and rational conception than certain neo-generals who claim to be realists.
I believe that the hour has come to form the confederal army, in the same way as the Socialist Party has set up its own company: the 5th regiment of the popular militias. I believe that the hour has come to resolve the problem of sole command by effectively achieving unity of command which allows us to move onto the offensive on the Aragon Front. I believe that the hour has come to finish with the thousands of civil guards and assault guards who do not go to the Front because their job is to control the 'uncontrollables.' I believe that the hour has come to create a war industry in earnest. And I believe that the hour has come to finish with certain flagrant extravagances: like those of respect for Sunday as a day of rest and of certain 'rights for the workers' sabotaging the defence of the Revolution.
We must, above all, keep up the morale of the combatants. Louis Bertoni, interpreting the sentiments expressed by various Italian comrades fighting on the Huesca Front, wrote not so long ago:
"The war in Spain, thus stripped of all new faith, of all ideas of social change, of all revolutionary greatness, of all universal meaning, is no more than a common war of national independence, which must be earned out to avoid the extermination which the world plutocracy has in mind. There remains the terrible question of life or death, but it is no longer a war to assure a new regime and a new humanity. People will say that all is not yet lost; but in reality, everything is threatened and beleaguered; our side use the language of renunciation, the same as was used by Italian Socialism at the advance of Fascism: Beware of provocation! Calm and serenity! Order and discipline! All the things that in practice boil down to doing nothing. And as in Italy Fascism finished up by triumphing, in Spain, anti-socialism in republican garb cannot but win, unless anything that we have not foreseen should come to pass. It is useless to add that we are simply setting it down, without condemning those on our side; we could not say how the behaviour of these people could be different and efficacious, as long as the Italo-German pressure grows at the Front and that of the Bolshevik bourgeois grows in our rear."
I do not have Louis Bertoni's modesty. I have the pretension to assert that the Spanish anarchists could have a political line different from the prevailing one; I claim to be able by capitalising on what I know of experiences in various great revolutions of recent years and on what I read in the Spanish libertarian press itself, to advise certain lines of conduct.
I believe that you must pose yourself the problem of knowing if you are better defending the Revolution, if you are making a greater contribution to the struggle against Fascism by participating in the government, or if you would not be infinitely more useful carrying the flame of your magnificent skill with words among the combatants and to the rear.
The time has also come to clarify the significance for unification that our participation in the Government could have. We must speak to the masses, appeal to them to judge whether Marcel Cachin is right when he states in 'Humanite' of 23rd March.
"The responsible anarchists are multiplying their efforts towards unification, and their appeals are ever more sensible."
. . . Or whether 'Pravda' and 'Izvestra' are right when they slander the Spanish anarchists calling them saboteurs of unity. To appeal to the masses to judge the moral complicity and policy of silence of the Spanish anarchist press as regards the dictatorial offences of Stalin, the persecution of Russian anarchists, the monstrous case against the Leninist and Trotskyist opposition, a silence deservedly rewarded by 'Izvestia's' libelling of 'Solidaridad Obrera'.
To appeal to the masses to judge whether certain acts of sabotage of provisioning do not fall within the plan announced on 17th December 1936 by 'Pravda:'
"As for Catalonia, the purging of Trotskyist and anarcho-syndicalist elements has begun; this work will be carried out with the same energy with which it was done in the USSR."
The time has come to find out whether the anarchists are in the Government to be the vestal virgins tending a fire that is on the point of going out, or even if they are there from now on to serve as a 'Phyrgian cap' for politicians flirting with the enemy or with the forces for the restoration of the 'Republic of all classes.' The problem is set by the clear evidence of a crisis which is outstripping the men who are the personages who embody it.
The dilemma: war or revolution no longer has any meaning. The only dilemma is this one: either victory over Franco thanks to the revolutionary war, or defeat.
The problem for you and the other comrades is to chose between the Versailles of Thiers and the Paris of the Commune, before Thiers and Bismarck form the holy alliance. It is up to you to reply, for you are the 'light under the bushel.'

South Korean Payment App Toss to Add Bitcoin Transactions
Former South Korean dentist hoped to smooth payment transactions. He stopped pulling teeth, and began working on a solution. His eighth iteration became Toss, a way to send and receive money peer-to-peer (P2P). Its next step includes bitcoin and even real estate transactions.

South Korea's 500 Billion USD Consumer Market
Known as the most wired country on earth, South Korea is no stranger to using mobile devices as a way of life. The Group of 20 (G-20) nation's tip-of-the-tongue heavyweights include Samsung, LG Electronics.
It also has the highest smartphone usage in the world.
With its focus on international trade, domestic payment systems ironically lagged. “Before Toss, users required five passwords and around 37 clicks to transfer $10,” founder Lee Seung-gun told TechCrunch.
Toss is a mobile application (app) created by Mr. Lee's company, Viva Republica. Demand for a simplified payment system was so strong, the company has received multiple rounds of venture capital, including from Paypal (which has its own such app, Venmo).
Mr. Lee continued, “With Toss users need just 1 password and three steps to transfer up to [$430].”
Catching the Cryptocurrency Bug
Making money transfers a snap means avoiding cumbersome certification numbers, bank account information, which Toss accomplishes. It also boasts foreigners being able to use the app.
This is a nice summary of bitcoin‘s advantages.
South Koreans have embraced cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, especially in light of China's announced crackdown, though its own government has banned Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Well-known, better established currencies such as bitcoin have benefitted from the three-pronged desires of South Koreans to absorb Chinese markets, conform to its country's own laws, and find suitable digital payment systems.
The New York Times reports how recently “the heaviest [South Korean] trading has been in […] Bitcoin Cash, which can handle more transactions.” Cryptocurrencies are so popular, local exchanges “Bithumb and Coinone, have set up storefronts in Seoul that people can visit to buy and sell in person.”
Mr. Lee, who also heads the Korea Fintech Association, said his countrymen were pushed into the bitcoin space initially due to trading hurdles in traditional exchanges where “investing into derivatives like put options now requires hefty individual investor certification including 30 hours of training and 50 hours of simulated transactions, a turn-off for traders,” according to Forbes.
Koreans “looked into other assets with high volatility and Bitcoin was the perfect one,” he said. “So high-risk traders put their money into the Korean Bitcoin market and it went up like crazy. Once people saw that, they just poured their money in.”
As perhaps an antidote to speculative-centric, short term thinking about bitcoin, Toss has reintroduced it as a transferable currency on its system.
“From the beginning to the end,” Mr. Lee answered in an interview, “it's all about making a difference in society, and ushering in social improvement. That's the most and only important thing to me, and that's why I spend so much time for this company. Because I want it to work, and I want it to contribute to our lives.”
What do you think? Can apps like Toss ease users into seeing the value of bitcoin as a currency and not just a momentary speculation? Tell us in the comments below!

What Will You Do if The Stock Market Crashes?
If the stock market crashes it will take the economy and real estate market down with it.

What Happens when Quantitative Easing doesn't work or is no longer possible?
Since the stock market crash of 1987 it has been a winning strategy to reinvest in the stock market after each correction. After the October 1987 crash, newly appointed Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan calmed the markets noting the Fed “stands ready to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system' and the 1987 crash became a temporary blip in the 1980's bull market.
In 1998 when the collapse of Long Term Capital Management threatened to bring down the markets, Mr. Greenspan arranged for a bailout and the dotcom bubble continued to grow another two years. When the dot com bubble finally burst in early 2000, the Fed once again came to the rescue by lowering interest rates that helped push home and stock prices higher. Mr. Greenspan's Fed used an interventionist monetary policy so often to prop up the markets that such actions were called the “Greenspan put”.
In 2008 when the housing bubble popped and took down the financial markets with it, newly appointed Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke came to the rescue with a massive bailout plan and a series of follow on quantitative easing programs. By printing $4 trillion dollars, the Fed managed to reflate housing prices and to erase all of the stock market losses incurred in 2008 and early 2009.
We may be nearing the end of the Fed's ability to pick up the pieces after a crash. Before 1987 stocks did not always rebound so quickly and there have been generational losses in the stock market. It wasn't until 1955 that the Dow returned to its 1929 peak. In 1966 the Dow was 1,000 and in 1974 it was 616. In the 70's stocks fell for so many years to the point where a Business Week magazine cover proclaimed – The Death of Equities. The Dow did not return to its 1966 peak of 1000 until 1981.
Even though the Fed recently announced that they will begin to wind down the current round of QE, they have already printed $4 trillion and with the announced taper will still be buying $75 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage backed securities a month. Thus, the Fed is still increasing the size of its balance sheet and continuing to provide support for low interest rates which is sustaining the stock and housing markets.
The Fed's QE program has propped up the stock market and the real estate market for the past four years. The Fed may not be able to end QE or even taper it in a significant manner without causing interest rates to rise and the stock and real estate markets to correct or crash. We have noted over the past year that the Fed has a no exit dilemma. In the King is Surrounded we wrote: “The Fed knows that if they print too much they risk loss of confidence in the dollar and hyperinflation, and if they print too little, rates will rise and the economy will crash taking down the stock and real estate markets with it.”
With the appointment of Janet Yellen to the Fed chair position, now it's the Queen who will find herself surrounded. The temptation for Ms. Yellen to continue the money printing may be too great for her to resist if interest rates continue their ascent and the job market does not show noticeable improvement.
The recent Fed decision to taper $10 billion a month from QE provides no meaningful clues as to the impact tapering QE might have on the stock market as the taper has not started yet and is small – just a $10 billion cut from $85 billion a month.
Given that the economy needs low interest rates, how will they be maintained if the Fed doesn't continue to buy tens of billions a month of U.S. Treasuries and mortgage backed securities? Who will buy the bonds that the Fed doesn't buy, and at what price? China, the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, has already signaled its intention to stop adding U.S. Treasuries to its reserves.
If the Fed continues to taper QE and higher interest rates ensue, causing the housing and stock markets to collapse, the “wealth effect” created by the Fed's printing of $4 trillion will be gone. If higher rates cause a reduction in government spending there will be declining contributions to GDP.
What will the Fed do if faced with a stock market/economic collapse? Would the Fed reverse course and increase QE? Would it have any impact on interest rates?
Has the limit of Fed intervention been reached?
What will you do if the stock market crashes?

Norwegians will tell you there are no rules on the 17th may, their National day, and it is true to a certain extent. On this day celebrating the day they signed their Constitution and felt free and independent, kids are allowed to eat as much ice cream and pølse as they want. Teenage “russ” are allowed…well they are allowed to do anything, and that started weeks ago: binge-drinking, dancing in disco-buses, showing their bums in roundabouts and answering all sorts of teenage challenges. 17th of May is their last day of silliness before they start their exams (yes you heard me: party BEFORE exams).
This is also the only day of the year where adults are allowed to start drinking alcohol from morning without being called an alcoholic. It is called 17.mai frokost and involves putting strawberries in Cava and eating very very creamy layered cakes with berries on top (bløtkake, and not blodkake as I first thought it was called).
Freedom, independance, alcohol, games, ice creams and parties, you would think everything is allowed on this day and you would be wrong. Despite the freedom that this day reminds Norwegians of, and despite the palpable joy coming out of all the street demonstrations and home parties, there are many rules NOT to break on this day and these rules need to be learnt by foreigners like you and me who haven't integrated them since childhood.
Note: there aren't just foreigners who won't feel completely free. As a parent 17.mai means a lot of dugnads, driving around, watching your kids in the 17.mai barnetog and other obligations before and during the “party” day. Drinking from early morning won't be for you I'm afraid!
Rule no.1: You need to dress nicely. Norwegians will wear their bunad, traditional costume, different for every corner of Norway. Being a foreigner you obviously don't have such bunad, so you need to wear a suit (for men) or a really nice dress (women). But don't come wearing sloppy clothes and flip flops. You can come totally hungover and even drunk from the party you had last night but you need to have nice clothes on.
I say foreigners can come with a traditional costume from their country/region, which seems acceptable to some Norwegians and less to others: “This is OUR day”. Some like to see all these “ethnic dresses” all over the city and I think it is a beautiful picture of multiculturalism and acceptance and living together in peace to see Indians, Kenyans and Norwegians side by side, all in their most beautiful dress. I got one made this year from Provence and I can't wait to put it on on Saturday. But as it is a national day it can mean different things for different people, and some Norwegians can get really sensitive about it.
Rule no.2: Bring a Norwegian flag. Anywhere else in Europe so many flags would be like screaming “patriotism” in a slightly negative way, but here in Norway it just means they are so glad to be a nation of their own with a flag of their own. Not having to put their national culture and pride under someone else's flag like the Danes' or the Swedes'. I don't advise you to bring the flag of whatever region you are from, taking advantage of this Norwegian National Day to scream whatever independance your region wants.
I usually bring two flags: Norwegian and French, but again there have been many debates about this and some Norwegians get really irritated at seeing all these foreign flags. Again, “this is OUR day, not yours” is basically the answer you'll get.
Rule no.3: Drink. Lots. From early morning, or start the night before. Just so that you are in tune with everyone else enjoying this day. Norwegians are not the most social and comfortable people when sober, so a little push is welcome to feel really free. (See What to expect from a drunk Norwegian on this same theme).
Rule no.4: Have fun and let lose. This is the only day Norwegians don't think of the future, of their mortgage, of where they will go in holidays, of what they will repair in their hytte and how much skiing they will do this winter. On that day they are thankful for the past. So do the same: enjoy today.
Rule no.5: Chose a local crowd. Although your friends in Norway might not be locals, a good day to hang out with your Norwegian friends is their National Day. They will take you through the day, make a great 17.mai frokost. You will see them happy and cheerful and they will explain everything you need to know about this day they are remembering: the day their Constitution was signed in Eidsvoll. Do not surround yourselves with only foreigners that day or you won't get a true feeling of what the national day is for Norwegians and enjoy the day through their own eyes.
Rule no.6: Get informed: this year is Norway's 200th anniversary of the Constitution and there are many side events to the 17th May since the beggining of the year. And remember this is a big deal for Norwegians, maybe much more than in your own country.
In France the National Day reminds us of the French Revolution where the people (read the bourgeois) took power over the King, the representative of God on Earth, who later would be beheaded. We remember that every year by watching military parades on TV and going to see the fireworks in the city centre of wherever we live. No traditional costumes, no craziness in the streets. Most French people are on summer holidays that day (14th July) so we aren't even around.
In Norway this is a big party but also serious business. Before being a wealthy oil nation Norway was the poorest and least free Scandinavian nations, and freedom from the “big Brothers” Sweden and Danemark who were much bigger empires is something people want to remember vividly: now we are free to be our own nation.
I personally love this day because the joy that one feels in the streets of Norway is so intense that it feels like pure collective freedom. So my last rule would be: Be in Norway for that day. Don't take a getaway weekend to your parents on that day, because this is not just another day in Norway, and it is definitely worth it! (And when do you get to see the Queen and King waving at you from the castle if not on the 17th of May?).

Last nights episode of Arrow was like a roller coaster ride from hell! This episode was titled Eleven-Fifty-Nine and that will become apparent as to why very shortly. Can I just say that I called this ending a few weeks back, and the Arrow writers have done a fantastic job with foreshadowing in prior episodes. If you have not watched this episode yet, and you do not want spoilers, turn back now. If you're a glutton for the spoilers like I am, then continue on my voracious readers.
*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*
This whole episode was just in your face with the emotions from the very start. We had to watch a very cynical, but rational Oliver trying to convince Diggle that his brother Andy was double-crossing team Arrow. I was yelling at my television several times during these scenes between David Ramsey (Diggle) and Stephen Amell (Oliver). John said some harsh words to Oliver such as “this is exactly why Felicity left you.” Ouch bro, I mean way to kick a brother when he's down. Diggle was not on the right side of this argument, as Andy was indeed working for Darhk and Merlyn all along. He was only after information and the idol that Darhk needed to get his powers back. This left John having to deal with his treacherous brother, and regret for all the nasty things he said to his brother from another mother. I hate to say I told you so, but damn it Dig, I believe I told you so!
The Arrow writers also delighted us with some daddy-daughter bonding fight scenes between Speedy and Malcolm. First off how the heck does this man keep sneaking past the security in the bunker? Poor Thea and Laurel were caught off guard in the bunker by Merlyn and a few of his loyalists from the League. Thea just can't quite manage to the best dear old dad no matter how hard she tries. The girls got beat up, and Malcolm absconded with Damien's magic idol. Then again back at Iron Heights during Darhk's big escape Thea once again comes face to face with daddy dearest. He challenges her and bests her yet again, claiming that with the loss of her killer instincts she can never defeat him. It's interesting that in the end Merlyn can not kill Thea either. She will forever be his weakness.
All these emotional strings that the writers were pulling were just to prepare us for the coming pit of despair. There were subtle hints and innuendos all through out the episode; that if picked up on you were at least a little more prepared for what was to inevitably come to pass. There was this great scene between Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorn) and his daughter Laurel (Katie Cassidy); “this city has enough heroes with masks on, it needs a hero without a mask, it needs Laurel Lance.” Then there was this single line from Laurel herself that sent shivers down my spine, and still gives me goosebumps as I write this. She was ready to hang up her Canary gear to be Star City D.A. but realizing that team Arrow needed her she says “One Last Time”.
Ms. Lance, nine months ago, I made your daddy a promise. I told him what I would do if he betrayed me….Oh, yea. I want you to give your father a message from me. I want you to tell him that I am a man of my word
-Damien
This was the nail in the coffin for Black Canary, after this bold statement Damian Darhk stabs her and team Arrow will never be the same. Oliver rushes Laurel to the hospital still dressed as Green Arrow, and demands that they “HELP HER NOW”! This is the only scene in which we see interaction with Felicity and the gang. They are brought together by their shared grief. I'm hoping this is the catalyst that brings Ms Smoak back to into the folds. Laurel comes back from surgery only to pass along a dying message to Oliver. That he was her true love, but that she was also so glad he had found happiness with Felicity. She seizes and passes away before her father can even make it there. The doctors call the time of death at 11:59, and the Canary cries no more! There is this final heart wrenching scene in which Captain Lance walks down the hospital corridor and sees the look on Oliver's face. It's instantaneous water works as these big strong men just fall apart over their tremendous loss.
Next episode is going to be another emotionally challenging episode for the actors and fans alike. We are going to see exactly how John Diggle is dealing with his guilt over being duped by his brother Andy. Also, how that might have indirectly led to Laurels untimely demise. He's going to be angry and pretty off the rails. I don't think Oliver is going to be in any position to rein him in, so it will be interesting to see who steps up. How will Quentin cope with the loss of yet another daughter? Will this bring Felicity back home to team Arrow? Will Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) stick around Star City and help them put and end to Damien Darhk once and for all?
REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst The Washington Post's Neil Irwin looked this morning at what he sees as the many reasons the upcoming nomination of a new Federal Reserve chair became a circus, unlike past low-controversy nominations.
Irwin cited the rising importance of monetary policy in today's economy, the White House's mismanaged rollout of their likely nominee, and the emergence of new monetary policy-focused media such as Business Insider (thanks Neil!).
But among Neil's four factors, only one really matters at the margin: The White House appears poised to make a demonstrably bad choice for Fed Chair.
If Larry Summers withdrew himself from consideration, or the White House announced that it isn't going to pick him, the circus tents would pack up and we could all go home. The Fed Chair race would become uncontroversial and boring again, Business Insider's existence notwithstanding.
People oppose Summers for all sorts of reasons, but here are my two.
One is that while we don't know exactly where he (or Janet Yellen) would lead on monetary policy, I suspect Summers shares the White House's unhealthy lean toward tight money. It's particularly hard to figure out what Summers would do since he's not actually a monetary policy scholar.
The other is that I fear Summers would squander the comity and collaboration that make the Federal Reserve Board work, since he's had a tendency to do that at other institutions he's been tapped to lead.
Of course, there are plausible cases against most nominees for most positions. What makes Summers unusual is that the case for him is so thin that it's mostly being made by his close associates. President Obama and many people in the Administration—broadly, the group of Clinton Administration economic veterans that includes Summers—are enamored of Summers' brilliance and consider him indispensable. Who, exactly, outside Summers' inner circle is enthusiastic about his nomination?
In this way, Summers is a lot like Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Making the case against the case against Hagel ("Friends of Hamas") was not that hard. But what exactly was the case for Hagel? What made Hagel so much better a choice than then-Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michèle Flournoy, the well-qualified, uncontroversial, female internal candidate, that it was worth enduring a bruising nomination fight to get him into the position?
Like Fed Chair nominations, Defense Secretary nominations are usually not circuses. The White House created one last year by passing over Flournoy for Hagel. To avoid a Fed circus, all the White House has to do is not nominate Summers.
Saturday was just another beautiful day at Dudy Noble Field - the sun was shining, grills were fired up from foul pole to foul pole, and maroon and white was everywhere as far as the eye could see. As the game's latter innings began to role around, all in attendance found out that the game we attended -- a subsequent 6-0 win over Auburn -- was the second largest attendance in Dudy Noble Field history at 14,562. The attendance fell just 400 or so short of the on-campus NCAA attendance record of 14,991, set by State in a Saturday doubleheader against Florida in 1989.
Sure, it would have been great for State to break the record Saturday, but even without doing so, State made its mark in another way on the attendance record books. With Saturday's attendance coming in as the second largest all time on campus, Mississippi State now holds all ten of the top ten attendances on campus, all time. The win bumped out a LSU home game against Alabama, which was the last remaining game in the top ten that didn't take place at Dudy Noble Field. Here's a quick look at how it looks now at that the top, with dates, opponents, and attendance:
Date Opponent Attendance April 22, 1989 Florida 14,991 April 20, 2013 Auburn 14,562 April 16, 1988 LSU 14,556 April 25, 1992 Arkansas 13,761 June 9, 2007 Clemson 13,715 April 8, 2006 Georgia 13,617 April 15, 2000 Ole Miss 13,123 April 24, 2003 Auburn 12,708 June 8, 2007 Clemson 12,620 April 6, 2002 Georgia 12,360
What else is cool is that should MSU continue to play well this season and earn a hosting spot, then there's a good chance that they could either break the overall record, or add to that stranglehold of the top spots in the on-campus attendance ranks.
Hail State.
Cameron Tringale was disqualified from last week's PGA Championship after alerting officials that he felt a scorecard error had occurred during the final round.
Tringale, 26, who is in his fifth season on the PGA Tour out of Georgia Tech, said in a statement that he failed to record a stroke on the 11th hole Sunday at Valhalla Golf Club when he went to tap in a putt and the putter passed over the ball.

He contacted the PGA of America and asked to be disqualified, an unusual occurrence so long after the competition had concluded.
"While approaching the hole to tap in my 3-inch bogey putt, the putter swung over the ball prior to tapping in," Tringale said. "Realizing that there could be the slightest doubt that the swing over the ball should have been recorded as a stroke, I spoke with the PGA of America and shared with them my conclusion that the stroke should have been recorded. I regret any inconvenience this has caused the PGA of America and my fellow competitors in what was a wonderful championship."
Although the competition has closed, the PGA of America said that under Rule 34.1b (III), a stroke that a player said he took but was not recorded results in the penalty of disqualification. Tringale finished tied for 33rd and forfeited $53,000 in earnings. Those who finished below will be elevated in the final standings, and the final U.S. Ryder Cup team standings were not affected.
"We are very appreciative of Cameron coming forward to inform us of this situation," said Kerry Haigh, chief championships officer of the PGA. "It again shows the great values and traditions of the game and the honesty and integrity of its competitors."
Tringale has won more than $1.3 million this season in 27 starts on the PGA Tour, having made 21 cuts. He is ranked 107th in the world.

A new study by the NPD group shows that 29% of Americans are now trying to cut gluten out of their diets, most of them just cause. Every time another person makes this foolish decision, my life gets harder.
I've been a Celiac for 14 years. My mom was diagnosed back in 1993. I am here to tell you first-hand that going gluten-free is not a almond flour paved path to the GOOP holy trifecta of increased energy, a dewy complexion and perfectly fitting skinny jeans. It is just a diet that is medically necessary for some of us and no better and probably even a bit worse for the rest of you. (If you suspect you are one of those for whom it might be medically necessary, I wholly endorse you giving it a shot, but, please, take it seriously and see a doctor.)
When my mom first got diagnosed 20 years ago our family would take long Sunday drives to the other side of the San Fernando Valley for a loaf of bread that was only slightly better than vile and weighed more than my biology textbook. Lost and vulnerable, she ate a lot of Lay's potato chips that year. By the time I was diagnosed in 1999 things were a little better. This was about the time when Whole Foods markets began popping up all over America and most of them would dedicate a few shelves to palatable gluten free goods.
So when gluten-free started trending a few years ago and I could finally understand what this red velvet cupcake phenomenon was all about, I was thrilled. Pizza delivery! Deli sandwiches! Whoopie pies! Chicken nuggets! Suddenly gluten-free was everywhere. But this was when things took also took a turn for the worst.
You see, when something that is medically necessary for some of us becomes something cool and trendy for the rest of the world, shit gets messed up. Waiters, thinking I am just another ankle-boot wearing Gwyneth wannabe, no longer take me seriously. It is actually harder for me to eat out now than it was a few years ago because a little dusting of flour on a piece of flounder equals a few days in bed for me.

And those red velvet cupcakes? They are now often stuffed alongside their gluten-containing counterparts in bakery displays. Considering even a few splashes of soy sauce, in which wheat is a minor ingredient, can trigger my celiac, a few crumbs of something not gluten-free is just not an option for me. Now I am nostalgic for the days when we were a fringe movement instead of a Miley Cyrus-endorsed lifestyle.
Though here I am, going on and on explaining why you should stop eating gluten-free food just to protect people like me, when you should really stop eating it to protect yourself.
As I mentioned already, gluten-free is not the answer to your dieting needs. Remember when we all went gaga for fat-free diets in the late 90s and guiltlessly swallowed entire packages of Snackwells devils food cookies and then couldn't figure out why we weren't losing weight? Exactly. I have met many a celiac over the years, and I promise we wouldn't all pass your supermarket tabloids "bikini body" test. Considering that many gluten-free goods are higher in fat to substitute for the missing gluten — which literally holds baked goods together — a gluten-free diet can actually leave us worse off, weight-wise.

For those of you who swear off gluten not because you want to lose weight, but just because you think it will make you healthier: please stick with the whole wheat. Fiber is one of the most important things you can eat for health's sake and it is extremely difficult (and pricey, see below) to get your hands on when you are strictly gluten-free. Also, for people with no sensitivity to gluten, a slice of whole wheat bread is by no means worse for you than a slice of teff, garbanzo bean and brown rice fiber bread. And the whole wheat bread will be, at least, one million times more delicious.
Also, this life is expensive! Literally, on average, 242% more expensive, according to researchers from the Dalhousie Medical School in Canada. Let me break this down for you: pretzels can run $5-$6 a bag, individual sized pizzas around $15-$20 at restaurants and even $11 for crappy tasting ones from the market, and cupcakes and muffins are in the $4 range. I just spent $12 on a whole-grain gluten-free loaf the other day and didn't think twice about it, because this is just my life. But it doesn't have to be yours.

Sign up for our NEW daily brief, your #1 source for need-to-know search marketing news.
There are a million rules for search landing page design. You have to optimize the content and decide whether more stuff is better or worse for conversion. But it's all moot unless your focus is on getting into the head of your customers. Searcher personas are the tool that delivers clarity as you develop ads and landing pages.
Personas are different from demographics. Demographics tell you valuable things about ages and income brackets that you may or may not be able to influence on your campaigns. But personas tell you about motivations and behaviors that anyone of any income, ethnicity or age might have. Personas are based on how customers make decisions and what inspires them or drives them away.
Of course your products are aimed at a certain demographic. Most of the people who buy insurance, for example, are one kind of customer while those who buy apps to find the most active bar scene are another.
But do they make decisions based on “gut” feelings or tons of data? Do they grab whatever site is at the top of the Google results or spend a lot of time researching? Do they want content that's just facts or do they want to feel like they know you a little before they give you their money?
Good questions. Personas can help, and because different PPC ads draw different searcher personas, your landing pages can speak specifically to that persona.
Let's begin by saying that the last thing you want to do is cast a wide net for every searcher. Consider if someone says of a restaurant: “They serve all kinds of food for everyone.” You're only likely to eat there if you're too hungry to actually pick a place that serves Texas barbecue, has a romantic ambience or whatever you're really looking for.
Or if someone says of a service company “They're a general handy-man company.” You're only going to hire them if you're sure they can do the job, are cheap and can come today. Otherwise, you'll probably look for a specialist.
Searcher Motivation & The Selection Process
It's the same with landing pages. Before we do anything we should know who we are speaking to and start by asking, “Why would someone come to my site? What are the motivators?”
Take, for example, a tree-trimming company. Why would people search for this company?
Commercial property managers might need pruning to keep trees healthy to protect the investment of property owners as well as protecting against falling trees that could incite insurance claims.
Residential customers might hire you to keep their yards tidy, their trees healthy and their kids safe under the branches. But this won't be just any homeowner. It will be a certain kind of homeowner who is meticulous and attentive to detail. This homeowner will have disposable income enough to maintain the yard.
Both kinds of customers might call you when a limb has landed on a car or power line.
Those are the motivators. Now, what about the behaviors?
Competitive customers are goal oriented. They know what they're looking for and they choose it very quickly.
Methodical customers are very deliberate and logical. They'll only call you as a last resort and would rather get all their answers searching online without talking to you.
Humanistic customers are the hardest to convert. They focus on relationships and how your offering will make them feel.
Spontaneous customers make decisions very quickly. They don't want to read a lot, they want all their main questions answered on a top-level basis and to then get on with things.
Now in an emergency like the fallen limb, most customers are going to streamline their decision process. They want to know how to contact you, whether you can solve their problem without creating any worse ones and if you can come today.
For those customers, you might want pertinent information above the fold of your landing pages. Information like 24-hour emergency service and the phone number could be at the top.
But what about for the rest of them? Competitive searchers may want to see a page of what other businesses or neighborhoods you've worked in. If you're hired by Chichi Park in the Best Part of Town, that's enough for them.
Methodicals want to know everything. They want to know if you're bonded and insured, what your experience and credentials are, who you've worked for in the past, whether your rates compare and a lot of other information that they'll measure against other information.
This landing page serves a spontaneous searcher with an emergency well:
This landing page would drive a spontaneous searcher with an emergency crazy. This is probably a waste of a click:
For companies that rely on a lot of data or are results-oriented that have charts to show their increased value or documented results, methodical are the dream persona.
For many creative or humanist businesses, methodical are a nightmare customer and you may not want to focus much attention on creating pages of data or content for them.
Creative or humanist businesses focus more on “I'll show you my personality and how I will care for your needs” and that's what humanist customers respond to. If you have a humanistic-focused tree care company, it might emphasize environmental stewardship and safety of children.
Spontaneous customers just need the basic information fast without necessarily looking at data or paying any attention to your attempts to connect with them.
But that's just the beginning of personas. Analytics can give you an inkling what personas are converting in the largest numbers on your site and help you further hone your design and content.
Choose the navigation, design, content, and images you will use based on the searcher personas you've decided are key converters and the biggest supporters of your business.
In fact, every part of your website, right down to the kind of action button you choose should focus on your personas.
For more on the four “Modes of Persuastion” I highly recommend the book Waiting for Your Cat to Bark? by Brian and Jeffrey Eisenberg.

The FBI reported on May 6 that it had broken up a possibly deadly domestic "terror attack" when it arrested Buford Rogers in Western Minnesota. After raiding his mobile home in the town of Montevideo, law enforcement found Molotov cocktails, suspected pipe bombs and a Romanian AKM assault rife.
Sources on Monday described Rogers as a "militia type" who had started up Black Snake Militia, a group with strong anti-government leanings. Rogers' targets reportedly included local authorities; he "allegedly talked about wanting to bomb the Montevideo Police Department."
The Minneapolis Star-Tribune described the suspect has having "white supremacist" ties. From the Star-Tribune report:
Several postings on Rogers' Facebook page from June 15, 2011, express his apparent irritation: "The NOW [New World Order] has taken all your freedoms the right to bear arms freedom of speech freedom of the press ..." read one profanity-punctuated message.
You will likely not be surprised that none of Fox News' primetime hosts mentioned the Rogers arrest last night or the looming threat of right-wing extremist violence. That, despite the fact the shows have dedicated countless programming hours in recent weeks to ginning up fear and angst surrounding the terror attack in Boston on Patriot's Day.
Prompted by the arrest of a Muslim suspect, Fox News has spent weeks demonizing Islam by assigning collective blame, as well as targeting Muslims who travel here to study. But yet another far-right, anti-government plot to possibly kill law enforcement officials? At Fox News, that's not a story that draws much concern, especially not from its primetime talkers.
It's true Fox has included a number of on-air mentions about the Minnesota terror news during its daytime programming. But what makes Fox's ho-hum coverage noteworthy is the contrast to its interest in making sweeping generalizations about the Islamic community when terror plots have included Muslims Muslim suspects (or, as we saw with the misguided post-Boston obsession with the "Saudi national," Muslim victims).
It was a Fox talker who suggested in the wake of the Boston terror attacks that American mosques be bugged and other Constitutional rights for Muslims be eliminated. And it was on Fox that viewers were recently told, "not all Muslims are terrorists, but all terrorist are Muslims."
When it comes to allegations of another right-wing extremist terror plot, Fox News is not in a rush to affix collective blame even though the list of far-right, anti-government terror plots, as well as acts of political violence in the form of attacks on women's health clinics, has become quite long in recent years. (Think Progress: "Fifty-six percent of domestic terrorist attacks and plots in the U.S. since 1995 have been perpetrated by right-wing extremists.")
Note to Fox News: The anti-government terror arrest in Minnesota was hardly an isolated event.
The Austrian Foreign Minister said that he did not rule out the outbreak of violence on the border in the course of the authorities' implementing the recently agreed measures to tackle the migrant crisis.
VIENNA (Sputnik) — Earlier this week, the Austrian federal government and some provincial governors agreed to reduce migration to the country to some 37,000 people per year, significantly lower than the over 90,000 asylum applications the country received in 2015. Prior to that, Vienna enhanced the measures to defend state borders against illegal border crossings.
"In the most part, the refugees behave peacefully. But, of course, it is possible that some will try to use force against the police and the army. Yes, it can lead to ugly scenes," Sebastian Kurz told the newspaper Oesterreich in an interview to be published on Sunday.
He added that limits to refugee flow are necessary as many of them bypass safe European countries, as Austria, Germany or, for instance, Sweden are wealthier and more prosperous.
"The next wave of refugees threatens the Schengen. I am a hundred percent sure that we will finally find a common European solution. Domino effect will increase the pressure for this to happen faster."

Europe is struggling to find a solution to a massive refugee crisis, with hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflict-torn countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Germany and Austria are among the destinations most popular with refugees.
EU border agency Frontex detected some 1.6 million illegal border crossings in 2015.
Turning pro next season, Colin White says, has “definitely” crossed his mind.
But he has not yet made the final decision that will move to a front burner for the highly-touted Senators prospect when he's done playing in the Frozen Four, which commences next week in Tampa.
White and his Boston College Eagles will compete for the NCAA men's hockey championship with the No. 1-ranked Quinnipiac Bobcats, the North Dakota Fighting Hawks and the Denver Pioneers, whose roster includes Quentin Shore, a sixth-round Senators pick.
The Eagles will face Quinnipiac in the opener of Thursday's doubleheader at Amalie Arena, with the final set for Saturday.
“Definitely, B.C. is a great place,” said White, who as a freshman centre finished second in team scoring with 42 points, including 19 goals, in 36 games. “There are a lot of great things here. I've learned a lot this past year. The coaching staff here is great. The team here has been unbelievable. There are a lot of things I love here, and then, there are a lot of things in Ottawa I love as well.
“There's positives and pluses and minuses to both things, but at the end of the day I think I'm just going to need to sit down with my family, Ottawa and my adviser and see what the best for me is at the end of the season here.”
The initial sitdown, at least, could take place in Tampa, as Senators assistant GM Randy Lee will be at the Frozen Four.
So what is right for White? That's a tough question.
The Senators certainly don't want to rush the 21st overall pick of the 2015 entry draft, who will be a teenager until Jan. 30. But even they must admit to surprise at how quickly White has progressed. The Hanover, Mass. native, whose two-way game reminded them of Boston Bruins star Patrice Bergeron, finished just four points behind BC scoring leader Ryan Fitzgerald, a Bruins prospect who played three more games.
White also performed exceptionally as an assistant captain for the bronze medal-winning Americans at the world junior championship. He had three goals and seven points in seven games, and wound up playing on a line with Auston Matthews and Matthew Tkachuk, two young men who will be top picks at this June's draft and should be impact players in the NHL next season.
So to think that White could help the Senators as early as 2016-17 is not a stretch.
“As a player, you always want to be confident going in to wherever you are,” said White, a 6-foot, 183-pounder. “So I think if I were to (come out of school early), I'd be real confident, and work really hard this summer to be the best I can next year, in whatever role I play. But for me, it's just being consistent.”
White followed the Senators closely this season, watching at least a game per week. He knows they had trouble with consistency.
“I don't think that's a huge problem though, in the long run,” he said, “because I think you'll learn from that.”
White is also aware of the expectations that will accompany the arrival to Ottawa of him and fellow first-rounder Thomas Chabot.
“I'm not intimidated at all,” he said. “I'm excited. I won't be really nervous at all, when the time comes.
“Personally, I just want to do whatever I can to help a team win. Whatever that role is I get stuck in, I want to be the best at that role.
“In the future, whatever it is, wherever I am, that's what I plan to do. I'm just going to bring a lot of excitement and enthusiasm, and work my hardest, day in and day out.”
White's hard work clearly paid off in his first year at BC, as he averaged more than a point a game — something he didn't quite manage to do in the previous two seasons with the U.S. national under-17 and under-18 teams.
“I was a little bit surprised, but I was confident going in I had the ability to do it,” said White. “I'm definitely just more poised with the puck this year. I'm holding on to the puck a little bit more. Being able to make plays, I think I've improved a lot with that.
“Middle entries for me, being able to open other guys up. Bringing guys to me and opening them up. I think just my awareness on the ice has improved a lot.”
All of which is leading him to the next step. When he takes it is the question that will soon be answered.
“Family, school, whether I want to leave or not, get a degree, what's best for my development,” White said when asked what goes into the decision. “Like I said, I'm kind of focused on this week, and then I'll focus a lot more into that.”
PAINFUL MEMORIES
Colin White flopped on his first trip to Ottawa.
Oh, he looked good on the ice, but he was unable to complete last summer's development camp because he flopped at the Spartan Sprint team builder in Gatineau.
“I was coming down the hill and I couldn't slow down,” remembered White, chuckling. “I couldn't catch my speed, and there was a little pothole covered by grass, and I stepped right in it and twisted my ankle. It swelled up a lot. It couldn't even fit in my boot.”
It took White four weeks to fully recover from the sprain. There was no lingering issue with the ankle, but he still wishes he could have been able to finish the development camp.
“I was really disappointed, considering I trained up to that, and not being able to (do) that. But I feel I did whatever I could to be a part of it, and did whatever I could with the trainer to get better as well. I still took advantage of whatever I could.”
And White left Ottawa for Boston College believing that when he was on the ice, he measured up well with other Senators prospects.
“I felt pretty good,” he said. “I felt like my game was getting better and better.”
(Reuters) - Virginia Democrat Danica Roem has been called a man by conservative opponents attacking her views on LGBT rights as she campaigns to become the United States' only transgender state legislator.
Roem does not shy away from her gender identity. In one campaign ad, she applies makeup at a bathroom mirror and takes hormone pills. But rather than focus on the politics of running as a transgender woman, she prefers to discuss traffic gridlock and other issues in the Nov. 7 election for the Virginia House of Delegates.
“Transgender people are just as qualified to say, ‘Hey, I can't stand being stuck in traffic right now. I have some ideas to fix this,'” said Roem, a 33-year-old journalist. “We can be leaders on transportation. We can be leaders on economic development, and yeah, we can be leaders on civil rights too.”
Her candidacy comes as more transgender men and women are vying for voices in the political arena where they have been targeted by conservative lawmakers seeking to limit their rights, most notably by restricting bathroom access.
U.S. elections this year could double the country's number of transgender officeholders, currently at six, according to the Victory Fund, which works to elect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender candidates. The group has endorsed eight transgender candidates up for election this fall.
A transgender man and woman are running for city council in Minneapolis. A mayoral race in Midvale, Utah, and school board contest in Erie, Pennsylvania, are among the other contests with transgender candidates.
Nearly 30 races in the 2017-18 election cycle already have a transgender candidate, up from 13 in 2015-16, according to Logan Casey, a research associate at Harvard University tracking them.
The community's electoral push comes as Republican President Donald Trump's administration has reversed guidance to public schools on allowing transgender students' bathroom choice and wants to ban transgender people from military service.
Other minority groups also have battled discrimination through gains at the polls. But transgender candidates face unique challenges in making their case to voters who often have never met another transgender person, at least not knowingly.
“It's sort of a double-pronged task that a lot of these candidates have,” Casey said. “They have to run for office and persuade people to vote for them and also educate them about what it means to be a transgender person.”
Phillipe Cunningham, a 30-year-old black transgender man running for city council in Minneapolis, once thought he would have no chance at professional success because people would be put off by his gender identity. Now he marvels at the support he is receiving on the campaign trail.
“People see me and they are like, ‘You're cool and you know what you are talking about, and you really love this community,'” he said.
In Galesburg, Illinois, a city of 30,000, 23-year-old Chris King lost an alderman's race earlier this year in which she emphasized business development.
The card she handed to voters also highlighted the diversity she would bring as a transgender woman of color. She braced for the topic to become an issue at public forums, but it never came up.
“I am not 100 percent sure if that is good or bad,” said King, a part-time student and pet stylist, who knows it was discussed privately. “It would open the door for some conversations to happen that need to happen to educate people.”
FIGHTING INCUMBENT
In Virginia, Roem seeks to unseat a 25-year Republican incumbent of the House of Delegates who filed a bill to limit bathroom access for transgender people on the same day Roem launched her candidacy.
Delegate Bob Marshall and the state Republican Party use male pronouns to refer to Roem. The party recently sent mailers to voters in her district that took issue with her support for school policies supporting transgender youth, suggesting she wanted to push an agenda on students as young as kindergarten.
“The mailers absolutely do not attack Danica's gender identity,” John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a statement.
Marshall did not reply to requests for comment.
Roem said Republicans are resorting to bullying after years of failing to address voters' quality-of-life concerns.

“This is all they have left: transphobic B.S.,” she said in an email on Monday.
Roem dreams of the milestone moment that would follow an historic win with her introduction in the legislature as “the gentlewoman from Manassas.” She would smile at two transgender youth she imagines would be watching from the chamber gallery.
“That fundamentally changes the conversation,” she said. “And then, let's get onto business. Then I pursue governing.”
July 17, 2013 - TF2 Team
Your time is valuable, and the fact that you choose to spend it on Team Fortress 2 is awesome. When we introduced the Item Drop System back in 2009, one of our goals was to reward you for spending your time with us.
We recently made a change that helps ensure players are playing TF2, not just leaving their computers on in order to get item drops. As of last week, players can no longer receive item drops unless they are actively playing the game.
As with any update, this change is meant to keep the game as fair, fun, and rewarding to as many players as possible. We will continue to examine how the Item Drop System is used, and make any adjustments as needed to benefit the players.
Questions and Answers:
The former fastest man in the world, Olympic gold medal winner Michael Johnson, was profiled on Wednesday's Today show as part of its “Where Are They Now” series leading up to the summer Olympics in Rio. Naturally, the conversation turned to the current fastest man in the world, Usain Bolt.
When asked, if he were given the chance to turn back the clock, who would win in a race between himself and Bolt, Johnson replied, “I win every day. Every time we line up, I win. Guaranteed.” Of course this can never be proven, but the numbers help to figure out who might win in this hypothetical race.
In the 2008 Olympics, Bolt set records in the 100- and 200-meter races, beating the previous 200-meter record set by Johnson in 1996. However, there is one record Bolt has yet to break. Johnson still holds the record in the 400-meter and has for 20 years. It seems the title of “fastest man” would be determined more by distance than anything else.

SCOTCH PLAINS-FANWOOD, NJ - The Fanwood-Scotch Plains Consolidation Study Commission agreed to disband in a unanimous vote during its monthly meeting at Evergreen Elementary School on Wednesday evening. Lack of financial support from the state of New Jersey was cited as the principal reason of the Commission's separation.
“We did not receive enough funding to form a study to decide whether or not we should consolidate towns,” said Fred E. Lange, who led the Fanwood-Scotch Plains Consolidation Study Commission. “I think that the state of New Jersey could have done more; they have provided funds for similar studies in the past.”
The commission was initially formed to oversee a prospective study by an independent contractor to evaluate the benefits and costs of consolidating Fanwood and Scotch Plains into one municipality. Ideally, the study would have analyzed whether consolidation would have benefited the two communities with the ultimate goal of taking a position and advancing it to a question as a ballot referendum.
Sign Up for E-News
Lange, who started the commission in June 2013, explained that consolidating the towns might be more economical and efficient, but an independent study would have to be conducted to confirm that before moving forward.
"I believe we have a missed opportunity with the disbanding of the Consolidation Commission, which sought to investigate potential cost savings for residents of both communities. I am committed to looking at ways that shared services could possible save money for the taxpayers of our township," said Scotch Plains Mayor Kevin Glover.
Fanwood Mayor Colleen Mahr was equally disappointed.
"The state of New Jersey, particularly the Local Government Finance Board, went out of its way in 2012 to embrace the first ever citizens-driven consolidation commission initiative led by Mr. Lange. Then, when the real work needed to begin, they provided little, if any, real resources or creativity to help produce a report that would have been shared with both communities," Mahr said. "They could have taken a more hands-on approach, especially when they realized the commission was struggling to hire consultants to help."
"I am hopeful that these residents will now work with Fanwood and Scotch Plains governing bodies as we look to ‎advance significant shared services in the coming year," Mahr added.
As teachers at a Fredericton High School bent over backwards this spring to help Syrian students only to have some of them harass and bully both teachers and other students, a school vice-principal suggested the federal government should help.
That vice-principal is right. Misbehaving students is, sadly, an all-too-common problem in our country's schools but most of the time educators have (or ought to have) the tools to deal with these problems.
But when the offending student is part of a wave of recently arrived Syrian refugees — unable to speak English and at odds with Canadian values of pluralism and tolerance — extraordinary help from Ottawa is required. The teachers are saying so themselves.
New Brunswick's capital had accepted about 450 Syrian refugees since last fall and 29 of them became part of the student population of 1,900 at Fredericton High School (FHS) early in the new year.
Most of the Syrian students were eager to learn. A handful were not. The teachers described how some bullied younger students and were insolent and disrespectful to teachers, particularly female teachers. One told a teacher that rocket-propelled grenades was his “hobby.”
“Our team have been accommodating about seating plans, gender, prayer, respecting refugees, etc. I was very disappointed to think that this was not being reciprocated by some of our Syrian students,” one teacher wrote to vice-principal Robyn Allaby.
“This complexity needs to be discussed at the federal level,” Allaby wrote back to her frustrated teachers.
The e-mails were among hundreds unearthed through access to information request made by the news site TheRebel.media that paint a picture of eager and admirably committed teachers bending over backwards to help refugee students only to discover that, for a handful, good intentions were not enough.
One teacher observed an older Syrian student bully a younger Jewish student and, with almost trademark Canadian naivete, wrote: “Obviously this is a cultural and political scenario that runs deep and while I like to think we can transcend it all in our classrooms, so far it doesn't look good. While I would like to simply say they are in Canada and they have to deal with their new reality, it may not be so simple.”
Indeed, it may not be so simple.
In fact, just before rising for their summer recess, MPs were getting an earful from educators about how complex a problem it has become for many on the front line to integrate students who may be illiterate in Arabic, let alone English, into Canada's school system. Representatives of school boards in Calgary and in Toronto testified at a House of Commons committee that they needed more federal government funding for “the complex needs” of these students.
For the Fredericton teachers on the front line, it wasn't just money they needed. They scrambled to obtain all kinds of resources, from Arabic language books to information about Syrian education curriculum, to help their students.
Watching Canada Day celebrations, it was encouraging — heartwarming even — to see many Syrian refugees join in and celebrate the country that is happy to adopt them and give them new chances at new lives. As U.S. President Barack Obama told the House of Commons last week, Canada has “inspired the world” with its acceptance of refugees. We should be proud of that.
But the example of Fredericton High School should remind us to be clear-eyed and practical about the difficulty that many Syrian refugees will have coming to terms with Canadian culture and values. And those e-mails should be required reading for legislators — provincial and federal — considering funding requests from those front-line teachers.

If state government introduces its controversial amendment to the existing Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, then an exodus of the non-elite class from South Mumbai is guaranteed
If the state government introduces its controversial amendment to the existing Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, to get rid of the unauthorised pagadi system, then an exodus of the non-elite class from South Mumbai is guaranteed.
The amendment means that tenants occupying residential units above 847 sq ft will have to pay 250 times the existing rent. Similarly, the rent for a commercial unit measuring 540 sq ft will shoot up by a whopping 500 times.
Voices of dissent are being raised from all sectors of the society, including the political class, accusing the BJP-led state government of favouring the builder and landlord lobby.

mid-day spoke to Congress leader Milind Deora and Shiv Sena's Pandurang Sakpal from South Mumbai to gauge their reaction on the amendment and this is what they said.
'A 300-fold hike in rent is ridiculous'
For the second time the [BJP] government has tried to introduce the amendment within a year's span. This ascertains that it has ulterior motives. They are trying to burden the common man, and we [Congress] won't allow this to happen. A debate on whether the rent should be hiked or not is a must. But a 300-fold hike is ridiculous.
Milind Deora
During my tenure as an MP from South Mumbai, I intervened and ensured that such arbitrary proposals were shot down. This happened at a time when we were in power. Have apprised the party high command about the issue and will involve both [Gandhis] to stall the proposal should the need arise.

There is a misconception that every SoBoite is rich. Several tenants, who inherited the apartments from their fathers and forefathers, belong to lower and middle-income groups. This government isn't interested in protecting tenants the way we used to. It wants to favour the builder lobby. A huge chunk of the tenant population in SoBo comprises of senior citizens, who will be displaced upon introduction of the amendment.
If the state is proposing an amendment, it should take people into confidence first. It must also consider the ramifications of such amendments rather than brazenly implementing it.
— Milind Deora, former MP and union minister, Congress
'Middle-class can't even afford Kalyan'
Though we [Shiv Sena] aren't against hiking the rent, but will never support such kind of hasty and whimsical decisions. While rent hike for larger houses should be reasonable, those occupying dwellings smaller than 500 sq ft shouldn't be burdened at all.
Pandurang Sakpal
We have categorically stated that the amendment is a way to throw our people not just out of Mumbai, but even beyond its outskirts. Most tenants residing in South Mumbai are occupants of chawls and old buildings.
How will those who earn on day-to-day-basis or little will pay the exorbitant rent? This amendment is nothing but a systematic displacement of the poor and the middle-class. We won't let this happen.
Also Read: Even the Brits can't afford high Mumbai rents
By planning to amend the rent act, the BJP-government is placating the builder lobby. Protest by its members against the recently introduced open space policy was just hogwash. The government has hidden agendas.
Our top leadership and elected public representatives are aware of the development and are ready to fight tooth and nail until the amendment is scrapped. With prices of essential commodities skyrocketing, where will the common man go?

Ian Duke is a developer in Magic R&D and has been with Wizards of the Coast since 2012. A gift of an Ice Age starter deck in 1995 sparked Ian's lifelong passion for Magic. He also enjoys math, physics, board games, and puzzles. To the surprise of few, his favorite guild is Azorius.
While a set's design team is responsible for most aspects of the set's structure, themes, and mechanics, occasionally new elements get added later on in the development process. I was on both the design and development teams for Battle for Zendikar, so I have a unique perspective on how the set's structure evolved over time. Today, I bring you the story of how to converge mechanic was added to Battle for Zendikar, along with an exciting new preview card.
Convergent Histories
Though it wasn't added until much later, to converge mechanic dates back to early in Battle for Zendikar's design. The design team, led by Mark Rosewater, felt strongly that one of the key attributes of the Eldrazi that players would remember from Rise of the Eldrazi was their colorlessness. Pursuing that line led to the creation of the devoid mechanic and a theme of colorlessness mattering. Next we thought, if the Eldrazi were all about lacking color, and the set was telling the story of a two-sided conflict between the Eldrazi and the denizens of Zendikar, wouldn't it make sense for the Zendikari to be very colorful?
The team explored a number of "color matters" themes to represent the fight against the Eldrazi. We tried various mechanics that played around in the space of counting your basic land types or colors among permanents you control, and even hybrid mana. The problem with hybrid mana was that, while it looks very colorful, a hybrid cost is actually closer to colorless than a single-colored cost. A white-red hybrid-mana card can be cast for either white mana or red mana, similar to how a colorless artifact can be cast for white or blue or black or red or green mana. We figured out that hybrid was taking us in the wrong direction! We were worried that with both hybrid and colorless, decks would just be a soup of cards with little color identity or distinguishing elements.
Sunhome Guildmage must be cast with white and red mana, White Knight must be cast with white mana, Boros Guildmage can be cast with either white or red mana, Bronze Sable can be cast with any color of mana.
Now, let's flash forward several months to the development period. The team had a different problem. What we found was that design had done so well at mechanically representing the battle between the Eldrazi and the Zendikari that the two-sided conflict was showing through too strongly in Limited play. Players were choosing to make either an Eldrazi deck or a Zendikari deck. There wasn't much blending of the two. Nor was there much going "off rails" and doing interesting, unique things that didn't play into the one side or the other. We knew we needed to reduce the mechanical emphasis on the conflict and add some new things to do.
We tackled this problem in a number of different ways, and by the end we arrived at, in my opinion, one of the deepest and richest Limited formats to date. (I'd explain why I feel that way, but it'd take an article all to itself!) Converge was one element we added to deepen and diversify the format. It was the development team's answer to design's original question of how to make color matter (to contrast with the Eldrazi's colorlessness), but in a way that let players explore the format on their own and go totally off rails. By counting the number of different colors of mana used to cast the spell, it encourages players to build very unusual decks. Crazy many-color decks have always been popular in their respective Limited environments, and I can tell you they're a blast to play with in Battle for Zendikar as well.
Constructing Converge
While the addition of converge was originally motivated by Limited play, the development team was immediately excited by its applications in Constructed. We're just coming off of the three-color Khans of Tarkir block, so there is ample mana fixing available to build three-, four-, and five-color decks. In fact, when you combine the Khans fetch lands with the new dual lands from Battle for Zendikar, you might just have the most powerful mana base Standard has ever seen. Throughout the set, you'll find a number of converge cards that reward you for building Constructed decks with these ambitious mana bases. Here's one of my favorites:
Talk about rewarding! Bring to Light combines the power of tutoring up just the right card for the situation with the bonus of skipping right past that pesky mana cost. Let's remember a few examples of similar effects from Magic's past:
While Bring to Light isn't exactly the same as any of these cards, it shares a lot of the same characteristics that make them powerful.
But wait! Didn't I say Bring to Light lets you cheat past a card's mana cost? Is that really fair to say, when it asks you to be able to produce WUBRG? Well, if you're building a five-color deck to take advantage of other converge cards as well, WUBRG may be easier to produce than say, 1WWW for Archangel of Tithes, or even 3WW for End Hostilities. Plus, unlike Green Sun's Zenith, which always costs you one more mana than the creature itself, Bring to Light offers to find you a five-cost creature and cast it for that same five manas. It can even find instants and sorceries! Oh, and did I mention that Green Sun's Zenith is powerful enough to be banned in Modern?
So when Battle for Zendikar launches on October 2, what will you Bring to Light? What tutor targets and other cards will you include in a deck that can literally cast any card in Standard? What does the best converge deck even look like? I can tell you I don't know the answer, but I sure had a blast trying to figure it out. I hope you do too!
Michelle Obama just gave her final public remarks.
The first lady got emotional as she spoke about her efforts to change the national conversation surrounding higher education while hosting 50 school counselors at the White House on Friday. (RELATED: Everyone Is Talking About The Dress Michelle Obama Wore To The Kennedy Center)
“We had one goal in mind: we wanted to make higher education cool,” Obama said. “We wanted to change the conversation around what it means and what it takes to get into college. If we are always shining the light on athletes and celebrities — and those are the only achievements we celebrate — then why would kids see college as a priority? We decided to flip the script and shine a big light on higher education.”
“We are very proud of everything this administration has done to make college more affordable,” she continued.
“We made it easier to apply for financial aid. We created a college score card to help students chose the right school. All together we made — in this administration — the largest investment in higher education since the G.I. bill.”
“More young people than ever before are going to college.” (RELATED: Michelle Obama: It Was ‘Painful' To Watch The Presidential Election This Year)
“As I end my time in the White House, I can think of no better message to send to young people. To all young people in this room, know that this country belongs to you. To all of you. From every background and walk of life. If you or your parents are immigrants, know that you are part of a proud American tradition — the infusion of new cultures. That has made us the greatest country on earth. If your family doesn't have much money, plenty of folks including game and my husband. We started out with very little. But with a lot of hard work and a good education, anything is possible — even becoming president. That's what the American dream is all about.”

“Diversity is not a threat to who we are. It makes us who we are. Don't let anyone make you feel like you don't matter because you do and you have a right to be exactly who you are.”
“Being your first lady has been the greatest honor of my life, and I hope I made you proud.”
Celebrities like Usher, Kelly Rowland, University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh and rapper Wale were all in attendance.
“All these folks are here because they're using their star power to influence young people.” (RELATED: The Obamas Thank Troops In Final Visit To Hawaii Base)

Canada's health scientists are furious.
Many have joined together in a virtual scream of frustration, as they watch the system they depend on for science funding crack under the pressure of a series of reforms.
They even have their own hashtag: #Pscream (a play on "Project Scheme," the name of the funding program).
And now some of country's most prominent biomedical researchers are joining the fight, warning about an "imminent crisis."
Gairdner award winners Tak Mak, Janet Rossant, Nahum Sonenburg and Phil Gold have added their names to an open letter to Health Minister Jane Philpott.
And the list of prominent signatories is growing.
It follows social media chatter about chaos in the midst of the largest funding process in Canadian science history.
More than 3,800 applications from an estimated 75 per cent Canada's biomedical and health scientists have arrived at the same time requesting financial support to keep their research going. Careers are hanging in the balance.
And the federal funding agency, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), has chosen this moment to radically transform the way it hands out research money,
CIHR's president Alain Beaudet said the reforms are aimed at strengthening the Canadian health research enterprise.
"A bit like changing the motor of a plane in flight," he said.
How's it going so far? Consider this tweeted image of a locomotive, on fire, falling off a bridge, and you'll get the idea.

New funding algorithm
Most scientists in Canada depend on federal research funding. They write grant proposals explaining what they want to study and how much money they will need, and they submit the application in national competitions that happen on a rotating basis.
Only a fraction will get funded. To decide which ones are the most worthy, their peers make the call. It's called "peer review" and it's a foundational pillar of science.
In the old system, the peer review was face to face, with scientists getting together, reading all of the applications, discussing them and assigning a score, a process used by almost all of the world's scientific funding agencies.
But the CIHR decided to do it differently, cancelling the face-to-face peer review and moving everything to an anonymous online system.
Scientists have been protesting the changes all along.
In January, the presidents of 15 of the top universities in the country sent a letter to the president of the CIHR asking that the changes be postponed.
In April, the health minister received another letter from more than two dozen leading scientists asking for a halt to the reforms.
The CIHR pushed ahead, even though it knew the computer systems weren't ready and even though it had created an unprecedented demand for research funding by cancelling two earlier competitions as part of the reform process.
That pent-up demand for funding has created the largest ever number of applications, with more than 3,800 projects threatening to overwhelm the untested system.
Inside the CIHR, staff were struggling to find enough reviewers to read all the applications.
One former CIHR official who was there for the initial planning said the new system was launched prematurely.
"I honestly think this system could work well," he said. "But the biggest flaw is the CIHR rushing this through." He left the organization last year because of the chaos.
According to documents listed under proactive disclosure on its website, the CIHR spent $1.7 million on a computer system that would match grant applications to reviewers with the appropriate expertise, using a complex algorithm.
But this "reviewer and researcher matching solution" wasn't ready, something CIHR officials knew in January.
English only, please
Just weeks before the application deadline, the computer still couldn't be depended on to match reviewer expertise with researcher grants in some areas. And it didn't understand French.
Lisa Porter, the scientific director of the Windsor Cancer Research Group, calls the CIHR pilot 'bad science.' (CBC) It's just bad science, said Lisa Porter of the University of Windsor, who is also a virtual chair in this review. "They were testing everything at once. As a scientist, you can't switch every variable at the same time. The experiment isn't going to work."
When the deadline for reviews ended on June 15, the problems started immediately, with some of the scientists tweeting about the chaos they were experiencing.
Reviews had not been submitted, even though the deadline had closed; reviewers failed to join the online discussions; and some of the scientists admitted they didn't have the expertise to do a proper review.
'There is much at stake for far too many of our colleagues to endure another episode of this failed experiment,' wrote Jim Woodgett in a letter to the health minister. (Linkedin) One frustrated scientist confessed he simply didn't bother reviewing three grants as a form of protest.
Andrea Juriscova is a developmental biologist who was in the midst of the storm, as a virtual chair in charge of a group of reviewers, all grappling with the new system. A week after the deadline, she was still missing reviews and rankings from her group.
"Everybody's frustrated," she said. "Frustration is global, across Canada."
All of that has created a loss of confidence that the best science will get funded.
With $275 million in science funding at stake, one researcher tweeted it was like handing out money using a T-shirt gun.
A broken system?
A big question scientists have is why the system needed changing in the first place. One factor was the Harper government freeze on travel expenses.
"It was certainly accelerant for the fire," said the former CIHR official who asked us not to use his name. He said the Treasury Board refused to free up the money needed to bring the scientists to Ottawa for the review committee meetings, which made plans to overhaul the funding process more urgent.
But the CIHR says the scientist themselves had issues with the old model.
They're romanticizing a system that was deeply flawed. - Jeff Latimer , director general of CIHR's priority-driven research branch
"They're romanticizing a system that was deeply flawed," said Jeff Latimer, the director general of CIHR's priority-driven research branch.
Tweeting for science
The CIHR is calling this a "live pilot." In other words, it's just a test.
But for many of the scientists waiting for funding, this could be their last chance.
"I know there are people on fumes being propped up by their institutions, or have laid people off, said Lori Burrows, a McMaster University scientist who is also a virtual chair in this review.
"These are not our 'pilot' careers. These are our lives," said one young researcher who did not want to be named, who is watching with horror.
'Everybody's frustrated'
The majority of people involved in this process have serious concerns. - Jim Woodgett , director of research, Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute
"We urge you to act now to require CIHR to return to face-to-face expert panels, as time is of the essence. There is much at stake for far too many of our colleagues to endure another episode of this failed experiment," wrote Jim Woodgett, author of the open letter to Philpott, and director of research at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute.
But there is no indication the new process will be changed any time soon.
In an email late this afternoon, the health minister said, "I think it's fair to say that the implementation of these reforms has not been universally well received by Canada's health research communities."
Philpott said the concerns about the CIHR reforms will be considered by the advisory panel recently launched by the minister of science to review federal support for fundamental science.
Meanwhile, the almost 3,000 scientists who have applied for money in this round will be getting the news soon.
"I've heard by hell or high water, there will be results on July 15," Woodgett tweeted.
"We've got hell AND high water." Michael Hendricks tweeted back.
National Water Commission under threat from Federal Government budget cuts
Updated
The National Water Commission could be axed as part of the Federal Government's savings drive.
The decade-old commission, an independent statutory authority which advises the Commonwealth on water policy, is "in the mix" for cuts and the ABC's AM program understands it is likely to be wound up.
Scrapping the commission would save the Government about $30 million over four years.
Staff at the commission - which also monitors and audits programs like the Murray-Darling Basin Plan - have been told their future is under review.
Simon Birmingham, parliamentary secretary to the environment minister - who has responsibility for water policy - has refused to confirm the commission's fate but says it is under review.
"As everyone appreciates the Government has a huge budget challenge to bring the budget back into a sustainable shape and we've made it very clear that all areas of government are under review for efficiency opportunities and of course, across the water portfolio we're looking at that," Mr Birmingham said.
"But that doesn't in any way undermine our commitment to deliver on key policy promises. Especially promises like delivering on the Murray-Darling Basin plan in full and on time."
National Water Commission The commission is a independent statutory authority which provides advice to the Council of Australian Governments and the Federal Government on national water issues.
Established in 2004, the commission monitors and audits programs like the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

Senator Birmingham said the Government was keen to find the most cost-efficient way of receiving advice on water policy.
"The National Water Commission does some very valuable work, what's important for us is to look at what that work is, how it can best be done and best be undertaken in the context of our policy promises as well as of course, ensuring that we have good environment and water policy advice," he said.
"Of course, any use of consultants needs to be done as carefully as possible and be as limited as possible to ensure that we're not wasting taxpayer dollars and that's what I would expect any and every agency to do now and well into the future.
"Everything is being considered and looked at carefully to ensure that we give taxpayers the best value for their money."
Dr Richard Davies from the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists says a 2011 independent review of the commission found that the body had been successful.
"[The review] came to the conclusion - and I might say that this was in a period when the Government was looking to save money - it came to the conclusion that the commission has done an outstanding job and also needs to continue its functions," he said.
"It's pretty clear that there's still work to be done, and in fact new challenges have arisen of course in the area of climate change."
Dr Davies says the commission is important because of its independent status, and doubts the same work could be done by consultants.
"The reason for having an independent standing body is that it is outside of government and if you have consultants ... they will immediately be beholden to the Government when really we need someone outside who is independent keeping an eye on progress," he said.

Doodle heart painting is an awesome way to make collaborative art as well as connect and explore with your child. When everyone is engaged in the creative process, conversations flow freely and children show their feelings. This is also a great project to give to grandparents or special relatives for Valentine's Day.
When making art with my kids, I often hear stories like this, “Mom, my friend Jack played with me for recess and we chased the girls on the playground,” or “Mom, my friend Kate shared her glue with me today at school.” These are the small moments that make me feel connected with my children.
3 Simple Ways to Guide Your Kids While Making Art
1. Ask open-ended questions.
Tell me about the color you chose.
What is your favorite part of this painting, so far?
How would you make this painting different in the future?
2. Offer your children choices. Let them choose their own paint colors and brushes.
3. Lead by example. “I really like the way I put the color ‘pink' in this space. I think it looks nice next to your ‘green,' what do you think?
Doodle Heart Painting Materials
18″x 24″ Gallery Canvas
Crayola Round Tip Brushes
Acrylic Paint (bright colors, try to avoid brown and black)
Pencil
Process
This past winter break we traveled to Florida to spend time with my parents and enjoy the heat, sun, and beach. Meanwhile, I had to constantly keep my children engaged so they wouldn't fight and drive the adults crazy. I came up with this super easy doodle heart painting for all of us to try.
The first step is to draw or doodle various shaped hearts on the canvas using a pencil. Draw hearts within hearts, turn the canvas upside down and draw more hearts. Larger hearts will work the best for this process.
Next, give everyone a paint brush and some acrylic paint. Each person must paint a different color within each shape. Eventually, the hearts will become rather abstract, and that's okay. At various points turn the canvas so everyone can work on a different part of the painting.
My only regret is that I didn't buy a bigger canvas. Next time we are going to go bigger! If you don't want to spend money on a brand-new canvas, consider buying an old painting from a thrift store. Take a look at this thrift store painting project from Meri Cherry.
According to a leaked email from the Sony Pictures hack, Snapchat has given former Apple executive Scott Forstall a 0.11 percent stake of its company for being an advisor. According to the email, Forstall was given his stake in early 2014 with his advisory occurring in January of that year.
Sylvania HomeKit Light Strip
Snapchat would not comment on the role of Scott Forstall as an advisor. In a statement to TechCrunch, however, the company said, “We have a number of advisors, but we don't comment on the specifics of their relationship with the company.”
Snapchat was given a valuation of $10.5 billion in a recent round of investing, which would make Forstall's share worth $16.5 million and the options vesting after 24 months. The email shows that Snapchat gave small portions of its stock to a number of employees, but none were given as much as Forstall. Several engineers were given 0.022 percent of the company, while a former Google VP supposed to get 0.5 percent before leaving the company after just 6 months and therefore not vesting his options.
Forstall left Apple in late 2012 and was replaced by Craig Federighi. Forstall, who was Apple's SVP of iOS Software, reportedly had a fiery relationship with many coworkers. A report from late 2013 claimed that Forstall was advising startups, traveling overseas, and investing in charitable causes post-Apple. That report lines up with today's revelation of Forstall being an advisor to Snapchat.
Other interesting tidbits from recently leaked Snapchat emails include that the company turned down an offer “significantly bigger” than $3 billion from Facebook. Snapchat has also been exploring the possibility of launching a music feature, according to the emails.
Seeking the American dream? Come to Canada.
In one of the most comprehensive studies of our nation's affluent, analysts report that two-thirds of Canada's millionaires are self-made. Strikingly, almost half the nation's high net-worth individuals are either immigrants or first-generation Canadians, compared to just one-third of millionaires in the U.S., and nearly seven in 10 of them generated their own riches.
[np_storybar title=”Other key takeaways from the BMO study:” link=””]
67 per cent of Canadian millionaires earned their wealth on their own steam; 20 per cent attribute at least part of their affluence to an inheritance; and the remainder came to money in other ways, such as a divorce settlement or through a spouse.
Just four per cent of high net worth Canadians are under age 40, compared to 24 per cent of high net worth Americans.
Education is one of the largest predictors of big bucks: eight in 10 Canadian millionaires possess at least an undergraduate university degree, 46 per cent have a graduate or professional degree, 10 per cent have a technical, trade or apprenticeship degree, and just nine per cent hold a high school diploma or less.
The online survey of 305 Canadian adults with $1 million or more in investable assets was conducted by Pollara March 28 to April 11. A probability sample of this size is considered accurate within 4.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.
[/np_storybar]
“Canada has always been positioned as a place of opportunity; with this study, we're able to validate that,” said Yannick Archambault, vice-president and chief operating officer of BMO Harris Private Banking, which commissioned the study. “[Immigrants] bring a strong work ethic, a lot of determination and entrepreneurship.”
According to the report, 48 per cent of Canadian millionaires are either immigrants (24 per cent) or first-generation Canadians with at least one parent born outside Canada (24 per cent). Of this group, 68 per cent say their wealth is self-generated.
Analysts also find that the face of prosperity doesn't necessarily have a five-o-clock shadow. Although males still account for the majority of moneyed Canadians, females represent one-third of those with a net worth topping $1 million – up from just 21 per cent three years ago.
Among these movers and shakers is Susan Niczowski, whose Summer Fresh Salads business tops $100 million in sales; Ann Kaplan, the mother of six behind multimillion dollar company iFinance Canada Inc.; Eveline Charles, founder of the eponymous salon brand; construction mogul Kelsey Ramsden; and Allison Byrne, COO of Rocky Mountain Liquor Inc – a company where two-thirds of the executive and 80 per cent of front-line managers are women.
Women are more empowered, more knowledgeable and more interested in personal finance now
“Women are more empowered, more knowledgeable and more interested in personal finance now (than in the past),” said Archambault, who describes the trend as the product of educational initiatives promoting women in business, increased female interest in financial markets, changes to family structure (more men staying home with the kids), and government policies encouraging equality.
A federal committee, for instance, is currently developing proposals to boost the number of women with board seats in publicly traded companies, while the Ontario government recently unveiled plans for reforms that would compel companies to disclose their gender equity stance in annual filings.
O besity rates are rapidly rising in the United States, s o that also means larger pant sizes, wider seats, and more and more overweight peopl e having sex ... doesn't it?
T here's a scene in the 1999 comedy, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, that applies to this conundrum. Austin, saddened that his female spy colleague Felicity "shagged" Fat Bastard, a ginormous 2,200-pound Scottish henchman, in order to place a homing device up his rectum, questions her decision:
Austin: ...how could you do it?
Felicity: I was just doing my job.
Austin: No, I mean, literally, HOW could you do it? The man's so fat, the sheer mechanics of it are mind-boggling.
In the 14 years sincehit theaters, obesity rates in the United States (PDF) have climbed considerably. Among men, the rate has risen from 27.5% to 35.5%. Among women, it has increased from 33.8% to 35.8%. During that time, Austin Powers' blunt question has been echoed around the Internet in various not-suitable-for-this-blog-post forms: How do morbidly obese people reproduce?This query is actually pretty easy to answer: By and large, obese people have sex the same way as everybody else, and they do so just as frequently . Even at levels of morbid obesity -- 250 pounds for a 5'4" woman and 290 pounds for a 5'9" man -- the "mechanics" work out just fine. In a 2001 study , only 11% of morbidly obese women reported "physical problems" as their primary barrier to sex. Instead, the foremost impediment to a healthy sex life was poor self-esteem, stemming from societal stigmatization. This affects both genders, but most of all, it affects women."Instead of enjoying their sexual intimacy, they're worried about the
size of their stomach or, 'Oh my god, he's going to touch my stomach.
What's he going to think about my stomach?'" Duke psychologist Ronnie Kolotkin told NPR.
Martin Binks, director of behavioral health at Duke University's Diet and Fitness Center, agrees.
"Unfortunately, people are internalizing society's definition of what it
takes to be involved in sex, particularly the body shape -- there are clearly
societal biases out there that are influencing us on an individual level and
not in a good way. "
Such societal torments, made commonplace in -- for example -- Mike Myers' comedies, are large barriers to intimacy for obese individuals. In an elucidating and inspiring blog post, a sexual educator writing under the pseudonym Ms. Vagina Science urged larger women like herself to avoid being self-conscious and embrace who they are. In the process, she also bravely and openly dispelled a lot of ridiculous inaccuracies about obese sexual activities.
For example, when two morbidly obese people have sex, neither participant will be smothered nor crushed, she asserted. (This erroneous belief actually crops up a lot, among both obese and normal-weight individuals.) Sure, extra layers of fat, particularly in the thighs and abdomen, can be obstacles to intercourse, but they can easily be overcome by maneuvering into "fat-friendly" sex positions.
"You may need to move your fat around until it feels comfortable," Ms. Vagina Science advised. "When I
was heavier, I'd have to literally pick my belly up and move it around.
Same with my thighs."
But while bodily physical barriers can be surmounted, other health conditions induced by severe obesity are more difficult to work around. Obese men sport a 30% increased risk of erectile dysfunction, as well as diminished levels of sexual desire stemming from reduced levels of testosterone. Depression, which commonly plagues obese men and women, also serves as a roadblock, effectively eroding libido.
Far more extreme cases of sexual limitation can also arise, particularly in men. Super obesity can cause testosterone levels to plummet and estrogen levels to skyrocket. This may lead to invagination of the penis, in which the member actually retreats into the bladder. In one unfortunate case, these symptoms were documented in a man weighing 660 pounds! During 20 years of marriage, he and his wife were literally unable to have sexual intercourse.
Considering this man's sad situation, it's likely that Fat Bastard, who supposedly weighed 2,200 pounds, would probably have suffered from the same debilitating conditions. In fact, he actually admitted that he hadn't seen his "willy" in three years. That joking assessment was, in all likelihood, scientifically accurate.

Just hours after pleading guilty on Wednesday to a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession, Rep. Trey Radel (R-FL) announced that he would take a leave of absence from Congress and seek treatment to deal with his problems.
“I'm sorry,” Radel said at the start of a press conference in Cape Coral, Fla. “I've let down our country, I've let down our constituents, I've let down my family.”
Radel, who in late October was caught buying cocaine from an undercover police officer, said that during his leave of absence, he would donate his salary to charity.
“I will be going in to treatment,” Radel said. “And I am going to start with intensive in-patient treatment … I have already begun the process.”
Radel did not specify exactly what kind of treatment he would receive, referring instead only to a “disease.” In a statement issued earlier on Wednesday, Radel disclosed that he struggled with “the disease of alcoholism.” And during the press conference, he disclosed that his mother had been an alcoholic.
“I'm struggling with this disease, but I can overcome it,” Radel said.
After entering his guilty plea in Washington, D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday, Radel was sentenced to one year of supervised probation and ordered to pay a $250 fine to a victims' compensation fund. If he successfully completes the probation, the court would then dismiss the case.
“I'm here tonight to take responsibility for what I did, to be held accountable for the bad decisions I made in my life,” Radel said, adding that he wanted to become a “better man.”
'Heretics': The Crisis Of American Christianity
Bad Religion How We Became a Nation of Heretics by Ross Douthat Hardcover, 337 pages | purchase close overlay Buy Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR programming. How?
The United States ranks as the most religious country in the developed world. And New York Times columnist Ross Douthat says that despite our politics, debates and doubts, this country is as God-besotted today as ever.
But in his new book, Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics, Douthat argues that religion has fallen into heresy (hence the feisty subtitle). Douthat recently spoke with NPR's Linda Wertheimer about why he thinks American Christianity has become distorted.
Interview Highlights
On the decline of institutional Christianity
"Institutional religion in the United States — institutional Christianity in particular — is much, much weaker today than it was 40 years ago. But religion itself is as strong as ever. ... But the eclipse of institutional faith, and the eclipse of what I would say was a kind of Christian center that the country used to have, has created a landscape where religion divides us much more than it used to."
On heresies
"The heresies that I write about are what flourish in the vacuum that's left by institutional Christianity's decline. So if the country remains religious, but the institutional churches are weaker than they used to be, what steps into the breach?"
On the heresy of The Da Vinci Code
"I start with the project to basically go back into the gospels of the early church ... and to sort of fashion a Jesus who seems to fit the modern world better than the Jesus of the Nicene Creed. And this project is best embodied by Dan Brown and by The Da Vinci Code. ... Brown himself is very explicit that he has a theological, philosophical message about what direction Christianity — what direction religion — should go in. And that direction is toward this alternative Jesus that he's sketched out, who is ... a much more congenial figure for a lot of Americans than the Jesus of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John."

On the heresy of the prosperity gospel
"From there I move toward heresies that are about money, basically, and about the idea that God wants you to get rich. This is the prosperity gospel. It's Joel Osteen. It's the televangelist you see on TV. All of these heresies I talk about speak to aspects of contemporary life, where traditional Christianity rubs up against the way we live now, and people don't like it. ... We're a rich country. We're a capitalist country. We're a country of strivers and go-getters. And the prosperity gospel says that's what God wants. God wants you to be rich. Which is not precisely the message of the New Testament."
On the heresy of Eat, Pray, Love
"From there I move to what I call the god within, which is the heresy of Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love, of Oprah Winfrey, of Deepak Chopra and Eckhart Tolle. ... It's less that God wants you to be rich and more that God is there to make you feel happy about yourself. And that the point of spiritual wisdom is not necessarily strenuous prayer and fasting and moral transformation. It's more sort of blessing impulses you already have. ... This ends up putting a kind of Christian stamp on narcissism, where the things we already want to do, we tell ourselves, are things that God wants us to do, too.
On what Christians should do about these heresies
"I don't have sort of a five-point plan for rebuilding Christianity in America. ... The main point that I'm trying to make is that whatever happens to the institutional churches, individual Christians can try to essentially be better Christians, and honor the complications and paradoxes and tensions of this ancient faith a little better, and not just go as quickly to the easy answer."
On Christianity's staying power
"I'm not without hope. I mean, Christianity is a 2,000-year-old religion. And if you look back across these various crises in Christianity's past, there's again and again been an assumption: Well, the Roman Empire is falling and Christianity will fall with it. Islam is rising, and it's going to just erase Christianity from the map. Charles Darwin has just disproved Christianity, and nobody's ever going to hear from it again. And Christianity has been very resilient."
Cosmopolitan, June 1982
Long before he was a politician, Senator Scott Brown (R-Mass.) posed nude for the centerfold of Cosmo. Sen. Brown won our "America's Sexiest Man" contest and appeared in the June 1982 issue. In those days he was a 22-year-old law student at Boston College who was cramming for finals just days before stripping down for our photographer.
Now, the senator's running for re-election, but unfortunately, we don't think his abs will come into play on the campaign trail.
Compared to some men in the GOP, this politician looks pretty damn good for his age — and we bet he still has an amazing body underneath his suit and tie. There have been plenty of pics of our president running around without his shirt, so now that a precedent has been set, we're hoping to see Scott shirtless again.
Since we know the candidate so, ahem, well, we thought we'd help him out with a few campaign slogans:
Scott Brown: A Name You Can Trust, Abs You Can Believe In
Vote for Brown. He Has One Hell of a Stimulus Package.
Leave your own slogans for Scott Brown below!

There is more news on progress for the 2012-Star Trek sequel script, which is targeted for delivery next month. Now co-writers Robert Orci and Damon Lindelof have indicated they have relocated to a hotel to sit down and focus on finishing their first draft. More details below, Bob Orci asks fans to weigh in on a navigational array.
Orci and Lindelof ‘holed up' in a hotel writing Star Trek sequel
A bit over a week ago Star Trek sequel producer/co-writer Roberto Orci announced that he and the team were shooting to deliver the sequel in "six weeks or so" (now five weeks or so). Late Monday afternoon co-writer Damon Lindelof sent out a tweet showing that they are really coming down to the wire and focusing on the script, saying he and Orci have relocated to a hotel to focus. Tweeting the following:
Roberto Orci quickly followed up Lindelof's tweet with the following quip:
So any Trekkie who spots Damon Lindelof and Roberto Orci in a Los Angeles area hotel bar tonight, it is your lucky night!
The practice of ‘holing up' in a hotel is actually something of a ritual for Roberto Orci. He and his regular partner Alex Kurtzman have often seconded themselves to hotels to finish up scripts. The writers have said it helps them remove all other distractions to focus on the work. The reason that Kurtzman isn't joining Lindelof and Orci for this particular session is that he is currently focused on directing the family drama Welcome to People, which just happens to star Chris Pine. However, Kurtzman, who is also credited as a producer/co-write on the Star Trek sequel, has worked closely with Orci and Lindelof on the Star Trek script since things really kicked off last summer.
The Star Trek sequel is expected to start shooting in late summer, targeting a release June 29, 2012.
An array? A dish? – Orci asks fans a deflector question
TrekMovie contacted Orci and asked if there is any feedback the team would like fan feedback on right now. Bob sent in the following query:
What would the general consensus be on the proper name for the main deflector dish?
That is an interesting question. The dish seen on all Starfleet ships through Star Trek history has been referred to by many names, including "navigational deflector", "deflector dish", "deflector array", and "nav deflector". What do you think it should be called? Post your comments below.
The dish on the new USS Enterprise, which opens up when the ship goes to warp
A dishy plot point?
Could Bob's question also be related to an important plot point. It could be that the dish, usually used to ensure safe space travel by deflecting space debris, gets a casual reference in the film. But there are many cases in past Star Trek on TV and film, when the deflector dish played a key role. Captain Kirk tried to use the original Enterprise's deflector to move an asteroid in the original Star Trek episode "The Paradise Syndrome". Riker's famous line "Mr. Worf, Fire!" ending The Next Generation cliffhanger "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I" was ordering the firing of an energy beam from the USS Enterprise D's deflector to destroy a Borg cube (and killing Capt. Picard as Locutus of Borg). There are many more examples, especially on the USS Voyager, of using the deflector in non-traditional fashions. The deflector probably played the biggest role in an extended sequence in Star Trek: First Contact when the Picard, Worf and Hawk actually
walked on the hull of the Enterprise-E to take on some Borg who were trying to turn the deflector into a beacon to call for reinforcements.

In what could be Asia's biggest IPO this year, Suntory Holdings is planning to raise as much as ¥476 billion ($4.7 billion) by taking its food and non-alcoholic beverage unit public.
For years, Suntory has been one of Japan's largest privately held companies. Now, like other Japanese firms helped by a strengthening yen, the Osaka-based drinks maker appears to be flexing its muscles. Suntory, Japan's second biggest drink manufacturer and one of the world's 20 largest by market capitalization, says proceeds from listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange will help fund investments at home and abroad.
But why keep its liquor business, which includes the award-winning Yamazaki whisky (paywall) for which Suntory is most famous, private? Perhaps because by staying unlisted, Suntory has had the freedom to focus on the long-term, a strategy that suits alcoholic beverages. It took 46 years before Suntory made a profit from beer. Its premium whisky ages for as long as 18 years.
But it's also a sign that all is not smooth in Japan's alcohol industry. A shrinking as well as ageing population is drinking less beer. Last year, Japanese brewers shipped 36% less (paywall) beer than a decade earlier. Suntory's liquor operations accounted for about 80% (paywall) of its sales for decades, but now its food and non-alcoholic beverage business accounts for over half.
And some analysts think Japan's non-booze drinks industry doesn't hold much promise either. “Domestic beverage demand is saturated. Whether Suntory will be attractive in the beverage industry compared with [beer makers] Asahi and Kirin will depend on its overseas strategy,” Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management told Reuters. “Just because the IPO is big doesn't mean people will buy.” It may not be relaxing times ahead for Suntory.
Car-sharing companies will get dedicated on-street parking spaces and stalls in city parking facilities if a bill introduced this week in the Honolulu City Council is successful.
Bill 65, introduced by Councilman Breene Harimoto, is aimed at encouraging car-sharing companies to enter the Oahu market. Enterprise already has a service on Oahu and car2go, with headquarters in Austin, TX, is looking to enter the market.

Car-sharing services allow members to rent cars by the minute, hour or day and pick-up and drop-off the vehicles at various locations picked for convenience.
Specifically, the bill authorizes the city's Department of Transportation Services to dedicate parking spaces to car-sharing companies for annual fees of up to $3,000, which would help compensate the city for lost meter revenue. The cars would receive decals indicating they are exempt from meter fees.
“I think it is the whole new concept of transportation to give various options for people to use as opposed to always having to rely on owning a car,” said Harimoto. “So you can just borrow it when you need to and it is a lot cheaper and more economical and convenient.”
Owning a car in Honolulu can cost about $4,000 a year just in gas, insurance, state fees, maintenance and repairs, according to data from Kelly Blue Book, which assess car values. That doesn't include the cost to purchase or finance a vehicle.
In addition to the cost, Honolulu has limited parking and some of the worst traffic congestion in the country, spurring transportation advocates to encourage alternate modes of travel. The state and city are currently collaborating on a bike-share program and Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell has made increasing bike lanes a priority of his administration.
Car-sharing companies have targeted urban populations where driving doesn't have to be the primary mode of transportation.
Globally, the market for the service, which includes well-known companies such as car2go and Zipcar, as well as university car-sharing fleets and peer-to-peer car sharing, has grown markedly in recent years, according to a report by Navigant Consulting. By 2020, revenue from car-sharing services is expected to grow from $1 billion in 2013 to $6.2 billion by 2020.
Growth has been fueled by increasingly inhospitable driving conditions in cities, as well as the adoption of mobile apps that increase the convenience of car-sharing services, according to the report.
Harimoto was careful to stress that the bill would not apply to Lyft and UberX, also referred to as car-sharing companies, which launched on Oahu in June. Those companies operate similarly to taxi companies.
Conversion therapy, sometimes called “reparative therapy” or “sexual reorientation,” is rooted in Freud's idea that people are born bisexual and can move along a continuum from one end to the other. The is no single, agreed upon approach; the therapy may include the sort of thought-stopping techniques used to control anxiety and depression, as well as religious counseling.
The legislative process in some states has reflected an attempt to avoid interfering with religious liberties and parental rights by focusing only on public funds and mental health care providers. As legislators have debated the bans, many have noted during the legislative process that conversion therapy has been discredited by experts, including the American Medical Association and the American Psychological Association, and that its methods have sometimes been abusive.
Connecticut's law, for example, banned health care professionals, or anyone else engaged in trade or commerce, from “efforts to change” a youth, while allowing other forms of counseling that provide support in a “neutral” way.
A similar focus prevailed in Nevada, where the bill was passed only after legislators changed it to clarify its intent — that the law would apply only to mental health providers, and not to pastors or other religious counselors. Governor Sandoval said such clarifications were meant to avoid interference with “religious liberties or rights of conscience.”
When asked about that change, Senator David R. Parks, the Democratic sponsor, said if a licensed mental health provider also provides counseling as a pastor, for example, “they must weigh where their professional role ends and where their pastoral duties begin,” he said in an email reply to a question.
The distinction was also made in the law signed in April by Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico. “This bill does not prohibit a minor's ability to seek counsel, advice, or guidance from a counselor if they are trying to understand their feelings, nor does it prohibit religious organizations from freely practicing their religion,” she said in a statement after signing the bill into law.
But she also expressed concern that the ban can infringe on parental rights, a view shared by legislators in some states

As world events threaten the comfortable lifestyles of the West's super-rich they have begun buying up fabulous 'bolthole' properties in the far-away safe haven of New Zealand.
The world's elite are snapping up properties in the tiny country, which they see as a shelter from the threat of terrorism, civil unrest and instabilities in the financial markets.
Interest in pricey land and homes in the North and South Islands has soared in recent years following terrorist strikes and civil disobedience in North America, the UK and Europe.
Scroll down for video
Threatened: The super-rich are fear their comfortable lifestyles in the west could be destroyed by terrorism or civil unrest, so have started buying up 'boltholes' in New Zealand, like this award-winning five-bedroom house, just a five minute drive from Queenstown
Safe: The country is considered the third safest on the planet, so is an attractive proposition for those scared by the prospect of unrest elsewhere. This five-bedroom home, a 40-minute drive from the city of Whangeri, has electric shutters so it's easy to secure
Bonus: Many of the plots come with huge amounts of land set in the stunning New Zealand landscape. This 6,505-hectare farm is nestled along the breathtaking shore of Lake Hawea. The house on this farm can be seen above, at the bottom of the mountain's slope
Financial experts attending the recent World Economic Forum in Davos this month revealed many wealthy hedge fund managers have already started planning escapes for themselves and their clients should life in the northern hemisphere descend into chaos.
Robert Johnson, president of the Institute of New Economic Thinking, said: 'I know hedge fund managers all over the world who are buying airstrips and farms in places like New Zealand because they think they need a getaway.'
Pointing out that the gap between the rich and the poor was increasing even in wealthy countries, Mr Johnson added: 'People need to know there are possibilities for their children - that they will have the same opportunity as anyone else.'
Mr Johnson was backed up by Stewart Wallis, executive director of the New Economic Foundation.
Mr Wallis told CNBC Africa at the Davos gathering that a New Zealand bolthole was 'a way to get off', adding: 'if they (the wealthy) can get off onto another planet, some of them would. I think the rich are worried and they should be worried.'
He pointed out that the 80 richest people in the world had more wealth than the bottom three-point-five billion: 'Very soon we'll get a situation where that one per cent, one percent of the richest people, have more wealth than everybody else (combined), the 99 per cent,' he said.
Suggesting that there was a risk the poor would rise up against the rich, he said: 'What's happened now mean we are going to see all sorts of social problems. It is a breeding ground - not just for terrorism.'
Airstrips: Properties like this five-bed home, close to the world renowned Franz Jospeh Glacier, are especially attractive to international buyers because they come with their own airstrip
Convenient: Your own personal airstrip means you can fly in, or out, with the minimum of fuss - and all for just $NZ850,000, about £410,000
Grand plans: This property on Lake Hawea, wouldn't match a hedge funder's expectations - but there is plenty of scope for redevelopment when money is no object
Agriculture: Many of the best properties are working farms. The Lake Hawea property comes with a sheep and cattle farm sitting at the mouth of a river, and includes several huts and a five-bed lake-front homestead
New Zealand, which is about the size of the UK, but has a population of just 4.4million, offers them all the modern luxuries they have come to expect - but miles from any country which may implode into chaos.
The country is 11,658 miles away from the UK, while its closest neighbour is Fiji - 1,612 miles away, more than double the distance between Lands End and John O'Groats.
Homes at the top end of the market come with tennis courts, swimming pools and media rooms - and some even boast their own personal jetties where a family can moor their boat.
But the icing on the cake for those looking to make a quick escape comes in the form of private helipads or, better, your own airstrip.
Such a property is currently on sale at the foot of New Zealand's Alps for a modest $NZ850,000 - about £410,000 - and just 6km south of the world-famous Franz Josef Glacier.
Many of the properties look ripe for redevelopment allowing the buyer to build their dream mansion - and, with prices significantly lower than in London or New York, there will definitely be money left over for that extra wing or safe room.
And once there, the New Zealand lifestyle - which has been attracting Brits to its shores for years - is said to be one of the best in the world, with a favourable tax regime as an added bonus.
Solitude: This entire island - once a holiday resort - is up for sale, complete with three sandy beaches and '62 units', so there is plenty of choice on where to stay
Space: Pakatoa Island, in the Hauraki Gulf Islands, has its own golf course, squash court and staff quarters - but exactly how much it will set you back is not known
Increases:Terry Spice, director of Luxury Real Estate, said they see increases in international inquiries to our portfolio of luxury properties throughout the country when a global crisis, civil or global conflict and economy weaknesses are discussed
Already, several billionaires have bought themselves homes in New Zealand.
Russian industrial magnate Alexander Abramov, who lives in Moscow, has transformed a farm in Helena Bay, two-and-a-half hours north of Auckland, sparing no expense to build five homes on the land.
The entire project - which included a warren of underground passages, to be used by staff, and its own power station in case of cuts - is thought to have cost £24million, according the New Zealand Herald.
But he isn't planning on living there full time. Instead, two of the homes will be used as a luxury resort, with visitors about to travel to it by helicopter.
American billionaire William Foley is one of several who have snapped up vineyards, buying Te Kairanga, in Martinborough, in 2011.
Paypal co-founder Peter Thiel also has property in the country, as does Tony Malkin, whose family's property portfolio includes the Empire State Building.
Wine: American billionaire William Foley is one of several who have snapped up vineyards like this one, which is on sale for £4,932,695. The ocean-front property includes a four-bedroom house, its own beach and forest - as well as red deer, sheep, cattle and Boer Goat
Water: This peninsula, just half-an-hour from Auckland, has been on sale since January 2014, and comes with a turn-of-the-century three-bedroom house - although there are plenty of plots available should the new owner want to build something a little grander
Island living: This plantation-style house looks across the bay to Auckland from the island of Waiheke, and boasts a 'boutique' winery, four bedrooms, a home theatre and a private art gallery
New Zealand real estate agents - who no doubt benefit from changes in the world's stability - dealing with wealthy, jittery, overseas buyers say the turmoil in other countries is a sharp contrast to the peaceful lifestyle that the country has to offer.
The 2013 Global Peace Index, which compares 158 countries for the risk of personal violence, rates New Zealand as the world's third safest country after Iceland and Denmark.
I think the rich are worried and they should be worried… Stewart Wallis, executive director of the New Economic Foundation
British-born Terry Spice, director of Luxury Real Estate, said: 'We certainly see increases in international inquiries to our portfolio of luxury properties throughout the country when a global crisis, civil or global conflict and economy weaknesses are discussed.
'More and more high net worth individuals want a "safe haven" or "legacy asset" they can count on should things go wrong in their country of residence.'
Mr Spice, from Dulwich, revealed he had recently sold a 2.9 acre plot of land to an overseas buyer for $NZ3million, about £1.5million.
However, the land was just the starting pointing: the purchaser is now planning a multi-million dollar retreat on the property, which has stunning views of a lake and surrounding mountains, creating a private paradise, which Mr Spice says would be difficult to out-match by anywhere else in the world.
Matt Finnegan, of Sotheby's Reality in New Zealand, which handles high value properties, told MailOnline: 'It might be that the people who don't particularly want to migrate here still want to have somewhere to run to in times of trouble.'
'We do get comments about personal safety from clients in countries like the US, but there are also expat Britons living in Asia who have expressed concerns about what is happening around them.
Retreat: This NZ$2,995,000 property, on a farm accessed by a bridge built with old railway sleepers, has 'all the aspects needed to build the ultimate alpine retreat' - yet it is just 10km from Queenstown
Large: The lucky person who buys this house will get a master suite which takes up the entire top floor of one wing, with views over the lakes, as well as formal and informal living rooms and space for three cars
Haven: Sothebys Matt Finnegan told MailOnline his clients might not be planning to move permanently to New Zealand, but 'still want to have somewhere to run to in times of trouble'. This bathroom's views are not the only thing to recommend this home - it also has an olive grove
Luxuries: Many of the properties on sale at the top end of the market come with extras like swimming pools. This particular property also comes with a barn, an equestrian arena, tennis court, jetty and boat ramp - for NZ$10,000,000, or £5million
'Yes, there is definitely a degree of paranoia when trouble erupts and they start looking for somewhere that is safe and stable.'
Mr Finnegan, whose properties include a ranch selling in the $NZ15million to $NZ20million bracket - about £7.2million to £9.6million - at Lake Hawea in Central Otago on the South Island, said overseas buyers sometimes preferred to leave their property in the hands of a farm manager or a caretaker until such time that they need it.
The views on offer are a bonus to the security, real estate agents agree - but only the super-rich, the likes of whom were associated with Davos, could afford to sink their money into the high-end properties of New Zealand.
Buying property in New Zealand is subjected to a few rules and buyers do not have to be a resident.
Helicopters: This home, set in 330 acres of land and complete with its own helipad, fishing ranch, cinema and 22 bedrooms across four different houses - not to mention the swimming pool complex (picture above)
Sailing: The waterfront properties on sale all seem to come with one very important addition: their own jetties. This particular property, about 13km from the town of Kerikeri, has permission to build a new house as, the estate agent admits, the person who buys it will primarily be after the land and location
Climate: New Zealand's climate has something for everyone - from hot summers on the beaches and in the swimming pools, to snow in the mountains during the winter
Wide open spaces: New Zealand is about the size of the UK, but has a population of just 4.4million - so it means there is plenty of land to go around
However if the property is purchased for more than $NZ10 million, or when it comes with more than 12 acres of land or consists of coastal land which is larger than 2,000 sq. m., buyers have to apply to the Overseas Investment Office for approval.
The biggest story this election season is not Donald Trump or the fortunes of the two winners in Iowa, the unattractive tag team of Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton. For all their attempts to seem current and contemporary, these candidates – and Trump as well – represent older, more established elements in American life, such as evangelicals, nativists and, in Hillary's case, the ranks of middle-age women, seniors and public-sector unions.
The biggest and most important development has been the massive support among the new generation of voters for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and his open embrace of socialism. In Iowa's Democratic caucuses, which ended with Clinton and Sanders in a virtual tie, young people opted for Sanders at an almost inconceivable rate of 84-14. In 2008, Barack Obama won this segment, claiming only a 57 percent majority.
So we are seeing the embrace of an openly socialist septuagenarian by a generation that, within a decade, will dominate our electorate and outnumber baby boomers as soon as 2020. That should put more conventional politicians, and business, on notice. Whether you are a Republican, a free-marketer or, even a Democratic-leaning crony capitalist, be afraid – be very afraid.
Timing right?
For the first time since labor leader and presidential candidate Eugene Debs in the early 20th century, Americans are flocking in big numbers to a politician who rejects the efficacy of capitalism and seeks to create a new, notionally fairer, system. Now, as then, the reason to support socialist ideas – some of which were implemented during the New Deal – lies with the palpable failures of capitalism. Polls of millennials show consistently that economic issues, such as jobs and college debt, are their dominant concerns.
The new generation's lurch toward socialism would have been unimaginable at any previous moment in the past half century. A recent yougov.com poll found some 36 percent of people ages 18-29 favor socialism compared with barely 39 percent support for capitalism. Support for socialism drops precipitously, to 26 percent, among people ages 30-44, tumbles to 24 percent support among those ages 45 to 64 and hits 15 percent among those over 65.
Another poll, this one from Pew, finds that 43 percent of millennials have positive connotations about the word “socialism,” compared with less than half that level among people over 50.
Perhaps one reason for this divergence lies in memory, or lack of it. Few millennials remember the collapse of the Soviet Union's “evil empire,” which occurred when the oldest of them were barely out of diapers. In contrast to older generations, who reacted against Soviet-style politics, millennials seem to make little distinction between liberal progressivism and socialism.
Conservative academics, a small but sometimes hardy band, place blame on a lack of teaching about the realities of socialism by generally left-leaning instructors at universities or high schools. Certainly from what I see, at least, few students seem to know about Stalinist and Maoist purges, famines and thought control.
Yet it's not just ignorance at work here. Millennials are coming up in a very tough economy where opportunity is limited, even for college graduates, with diminishing returns accompanying soaring tuition. Millennials are finding everything harder than their parents did – leaving a record number living at home into their late 20s and earlier 30s, or sheltering with their friends in apartments. Record levels of student debt, twice the average two decades ago, are slowing economic progress. Relieving this indebtedness is one element of Sanders' appeal.
At the same time, relatively few young people are starting businesses. Being in debt and asset-free does not augur well for the prospect of nurturing appreciation for the creative power of capitalism in the next generation.
A party divided
The rise of support for socialism among millennials is having an immediate impact on the Democratic Party. Many left-leaning Democrats rightfully detest the kind of modulated crony capitalism epitomized by Hillary Clinton. This could precipitate a civil war among major Democratic donors – notably in Silicon Valley – who may embrace progressive views on cultural and environmental issues, but have little interest in having their massive wealth threatened by regulations or hypertaxation.
“They don't like [Bernie] Sanders at all,” notes San Francisco-based researcher Greg Ferenstein, who has been polling Internet company founders for an upcoming book. Sanders' emphasis on income redistribution and protecting union privileges and pensions violates the favorite notions of the tech elite. “He's an egalitarian liberal,” Ferenstein explains, “these people are tech liberals. Equality is a nonissue in Silicon Valley.”
Although maybe not an issue among the tech oligarchs, class and inequality are not “nonissues” for many progressives of all ages. In blue bastions like San Francisco, grass-roots progressives regard tech billionaires, and their employees, with about the same regard evangelicals have for abortionists. To many old-line Bay Area liberals, the tech moguls – with their tax breaks, special employee buses and expensive tastes – are transforming their once-diverse city into an unconscionably expensive, class-ridden enclave. In many ways, as the Who sang, “the new boss” turns out to be as remarkably oppressive as the “old boss.”
This division will become clearer as the Clinton machine, and its media apparatus, go after Sanders. The Vermont senator was better treated before he posed a serious threat. Now that he is challenging the gentry liberal consensus, the mainstream media, increasingly under the sway of tech oligarchs, are mounting increasingly strident attacks on Sanders. These attacks have been led by the Washington Post, owned by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, whose fortune and sometimes brutal business practices would fare far better under Clinton than Sanders.
Indeed, the defense of crony capitalism is implicit in the Clinton appeal. After all, she is running with funds collected from financial, technology and other crony industries. Some of these same people have also been quite generous toward the Clinton Foundation, Bill and Hillary's ethically challenged holding company.
Future of capitalism
Some conservatives – particularly given the chaos of the Republican race – might be tempted to revel in the new Democratic lurch to the left, which conceivably could drive the party too far from the mainstream, at least for older generations. But millennials are the future, and, if the GOP retains its reactionary ideas on key social issues – notably the mass expulsion of undocumented immigrants, legalizing marijuana and gay marriage – its chances of reaching millennial voters may be minimal.
Ultimately, the future of capitalism depends on making the system work for the majority of people, including millennials. The current system, frankly, is producing few benefits for the vast majority of Americans, giving the free market a bad name and turning off millennials. Fully half of them, notes a recent Harvard study, already believe the “American Dream” is dead. More than 10 million millennials are outside the system, neither employed nor in education or training, a population that seems ripe for leftist agitation.
Simply put, to change millennial views, capitalism also needs to change from its current trajectory. The predominant system of crony capitalism, most ensconced in blue states like California, clearly favors the already affluent. At the same time, nonsocialists need to do a better job of explaining the past failures of state control; most millennials, as the Reason Foundation has pointed out, do not even associate socialism with a state-centered economy, which most of them say they would strongly oppose.
And, to be sure, there are elements of millennial attitudes that push back against socialist practices. Millennials, for example, tend to distrust all institutions, including government, according to Pew, and half consider themselves independents, far more than in any other generation. They may be alienated from large financial and corporate institutions but may not remain permanently in the tank for ever more intrusive government.
Ultimately, reality, not knowledge, changes attitudes. Until capitalists focus more on jobs and upward mobility, and less on asset inflation, young people have little reason to change their minds. Unless capitalism or its crony offshoots can create a credible future for the young, there's little reason to expect that this generation will abandon their determination to change the system that, for all its faults, has created more prosperity over time for more people than any other.

The US is planning direct talks between Russian and American military officials over Russia's growing involvement in Syria, John Kerry has said.
The US secretary of state said on Friday that President Barack Obama believed military-to-military discussions with Russia were "an important step" to resolve a worsening Syria crisis.
The announcement came days after the idea was broached by Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, in a phone call with Kerry.
According to Kerry, the Pentagon would take the lead in the discussions, but did not elaborate on the exact level, venue and timing.
Later on Friday, Ash Carter, the US defence secretary, and Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, made the first call since August 2014, the Pentagon said.
"They agreed to further discuss mechanisms for deconfliction in Syria and the counter-ISIL campaign," the Pentagon said, referring to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group.
In another development, a Russian media report has claimed that some Russian military contractors are being sent to Syria without their consent.
The report, published by the Russian online newspaper gazeta.ru on Friday, said that 20 troops, including officers and contracted soldiers, were selected from a military unit of Russia's Eastern military district command and sent on a mission without being told about the final destination.
'Hot country'
According to the contractors cited in the report, the commander only told them at the beginning that they might be sent to a "hot country".
On September 16, they were informally told by a representative of a military chief about the secretly planned deployment to Syria's Latakia, prompting protest from "almost everyone".
"Some two or three soldiers, due to their young age and youth and credulity, were thinking the commanders would not dare send us to Syria, and we will be deployed in Crimea or Ossetia instead," a contractor was quoted as saying.
"We don't want to go to Syria; we don't want to die there," the publication quoted one of the lieutenants as saying.
The contractors sought to hand in their resignation on the same day, but the documents were rejected.
Aleksey Tonevitskiy, deputy military prosecutor of Novorossiysk, where the troops were taken while waiting the departure to the final destination, told gazeta.ru that the whole story was "a nonsense".
"It was either a provocation aiming to lower the image of the Russian Federation in the eyes of the international community by suggesting that our military servicemen are going to the territory of a foreign country to fight," he said.
"If they are afraid of something, let them please officially say so, in writing, who and what kind of authoritative people are threatening them. We will look into it, no problem."
The online report said the particular group was supposed to be deployed to Syria on September 17, but it was postponed due to the scandal around the protesting soldiers.
The military base is now awaiting official military commission to look into the issue.
Russia has never acknowledged sending troops to Syria. Moscow says there are only Russian military advisers in the country to support President Bashar al-Assad's efforts to curb ISIL.
However, on Friday, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said that Russia would consider sending troops to fight in Syria if Damascus asked for them.
Dmitry Peskov spoke in response to comments by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem, who denied reports that Russian combat troops were fighting with Syrian troops - but said that Syria would ask for Russia's help if needed.
If such a request is made, it will be "discussed and considered", Peskov said.

Streetcars were the most popular mode of (relatively) rapid transit across New Orleans in 1885, cheaper to operate than a horse and wagon and much faster than moving about on foot. There weren't many other options. Practical bicycling was uncommon in the era of the penny farthing, and the affordable automobile was years away.
So people of means who had any significant distance to travel around the city simply took the streetcars, which were pulled by mules at the time. Cars were crowded with a mixture of people of different social backgrounds, ages and ethnicities.
One particularly sensitive streetcar rider took note of the huddled masses and didn't like what he saw. In what amounts to a 19th century version of what would, might be called a "listicle" today, he lays out a list of 43 grievances about fellow passengers published in The Daily Picayune on Dec. 13, 1885. The observations provide unusually candid insight into the streetcar riding experience in the era.
They range from observations about the olfactory sensations ("men who have been eating onions," "men who smoke bad cigars," "peddlers who fill the cars with their wares and smell badly") to questionable grooming habits ("men who pick their teeth in public," "men who clean their finger nails in public").
Some of the complaints sound like they could come from the present day. For instance, the writer observes "stareful men," "men who sit sideways when people are looking for seats" and "squalling (sic) babies." And some of the issues just seem petty.
Not all of them were entirely unfounded, however. The writer complains of "juveniles who insist on skylarking," i.e. pranksters, about six months after the Picayune made note of "the comical young men who put cartridges on street car tracks."
And the writer was also bothered by "men who chew and expectorate in the cars," two decades before the city passed an ordinance that prohibited spitting on streetcars.
Perhaps what is most notable about the complaints about streetcar passengers in 1885 is what's not there. Though it was published after Reconstruction and before the state passed its Jim Crow law establishing separate cars for white and black passengers, the list makes no mention of passengers' race.
Surprise storm showers measure three times background, exceed CHP HazMat levels
A fast moving thunderstorm system blew through Southern California Friday bringing with it more than much-needed precipitation. The rain read hot for dangerous beta radiation.
Radiation exceeding 3.3 times background levels was detected and videotaped by EnviroReporter.com at its Radiation Station Santa Monica at the western edge of the Los Angeles basin. It is the hottest precipitation detected at the station since March 2012 when ocean mists topped 500 percent of background.
“Just when I thought it was safe to step out into the rain again,” said Dale Ramicone of Radiation Station Glendale California in an email to EnviroReporter.com. “That little surprise shower even had a bit of lightening in it! When you asked for a sample, I didn't really expect to find anything all that significant. My wife arrived minutes later, and I took a sample from the rain still remaining on edge of the windshield. The Inspector ten minute sample counted 121.2 CPM [Counts Per Minute] way above background which was 37.9 CPM.”
Ramicone's reading nearly matches that of Radiation Station Santa Monica's highest detection with the hot Glendale water coming in at 3.20 times background. That is above the California Highway Patrol's tripwire for a radioactive material exceeding triple normal radiation readings.
According to government documents obtained by EnviroReporter.com, the CHP considers any substance radiating more than three times background hot enough to trip its Hazardous Materials protocols. This information was gleaned from a Nuclear Regulatory Commission “Event Notification Report for December 16, 2011.”
“On 12/8/11 at 1430 PST, the Nevada Radiation Control Program (NRCP) received a call from the Alternate Radiation Safety Officer (ARSO) for Renown South Meadows Medical Center, that a truck carrying linen had been detained by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) at the Truckee inspection station after setting off a radiation alarm,” the report read.
“The NRCP contacted the CHP and were told that they had surveyed the truck with a Ludlum meter and measured .400 millirem per hour (or 400 microR/hour) outside the trailer,” the report continued. “The CHP said that their protocols dictate that anything above three times background is treated as a hazmat incident and must have proper packaging and manifest.”
CHP emergency measures include suiting up personnel in impermeable outfits with ventilators, commonly known as “moon suits.” Those precautions were not evident in the greater Los Angeles area as the storm drenched thousands of people caught unawares of the impending rain.
High levels of beta radiation in rain are especially of concern when children and pregnant women are exposed to the hot water which can cause blood cancers, including leukemia, and a host of ailments introduced courtesy of the Atomic Age. Cesium-137, strontium-90 and plutonium 239/240 are beta emitting radionuclides of particular concern because of their lethality.
Ramicone's radiation station streams live radiation readings around the clock and has been seen by tens of thousands of viewers. The Glendale station is part of nine EnviroReporter.com-affiliated radiation detection branches which have generated over 2,733 special radiation tests and reports since the triple meltdowns began at the destroyed Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Japan March 11, 2011. There is still no control over that disastrous situation with no end in sight as hundreds of thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water continue to spew into the Pacific Ocean every day now for close to four years.
This invaluable radiation stations data is in addition to over 4,351 reports, analysis and tests conducted by EnviroReporter.com in California and across the United States. We have also organized the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's radiation detection for easy access and clarity in RadNet Air Monitoring. Only 34 out of the agency's 124 beta monitors across the nation were functional Friday, a dismal 27.5 success rate.
The surprise storm, which circulated counterclockwise through Southern California and Arizona before depositing its toxic cargo on Los Angeles, originally blew onshore from Pacific waters off of Baja California, Mexico. After pelting these desert climes with radioactive rain, the system rumbled eastward across New Mexico and Texas carrying its hot load.
“This is troubling nearly four years after Fukushima nuclear meltdowns,” remarked Ramicone. “Clearly, there's radiation still coming from somewhere, and it's washing out of the atmosphere. Notably, not every rain shower contains it. Finding out exactly what kind of radiation it is, and determining its source is the most important thing now. Radioactive isotopes don't just vanish because we're not thinking about them.”
Plot Edit
Artist and graphics designer Patience Phillips is a meek people-pleaser whose main support is her best friend Sally. She works for a cosmetics company called Hedare Beauty which is ready to ship a new skin cream called Beau-line that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, when Patience visits the R&D laboratory facility to deliver a re-done ad design, she overhears a discussion between the scientist Dr. Ivan Slavicky and Laurel Hedare, the wife of company-owner George Hedare, about the dangerous side effects from continued use of the product. Laurel's guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Washed up on shore, Patience is mysteriously brought back to life by an Egyptian Mau cat which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like abilities. From Mau's owner eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers, Patience learns that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess Bast. Patience realizes that she is now a "catwoman," reborn with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Disguised as Catwoman to hide her identity, Patience under cover of darkness searches for answers as to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which includes finding Slavicky's body, and later being accused of his murder) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on George, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is attending an opera with another woman) as Catwoman, he reveals he knows nothing about the side effects. The police, led by Patience's love interest Detective Tom Lone, arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders her husband for his infidelity and admits to having Dr. Slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product's release. She contacts Catwoman and frames her for the murder. Catwoman is then taken into custody by Tom, but not before Laurel reveals the side-effects of the product: discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble. She also plans to release Beau-line to the public the following day. Patience slips out of her cell and confronts Laurel in her office, rescuing Tom who came to question Laurel after second thoughts about Patience's guilt in the process and revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. During the fight, she scratches Laurel's face multiple times causing Laurel to fall out of a window and grab onto a pipe. Laurel sees her face in a window's reflection and horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration (as a result of the scratches and her own use of Beau-line for years), fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. Though Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she decides to end things with Tom by choosing to continue living outside the law and enjoying her newfound freedom as the mysterious Catwoman.

Release Edit
The film was originally given an IMAX release coinciding with the general release as evidenced by a poster with the tagline "CATch Her in IMAX", but it was cancelled because Warner Bros. decided that the delays on the visual effects did not give IMAX enough time to remaster the film in time for its release. The decision to cancel the IMAX release was announced on June 30, 2004. Home media Edit Catwoman was released on VHS and DVD on January 18, 2005, and on Blu-ray on September 8, 2009.

Another look at Ricardian equivalence: The case of the European Union
Thomas Grennes, Andris Strazds
Can European countries share their debts? This column argues that higher government indebtedness means larger household net financial assets. Thus, any pooling of European legacy debt would be considered unacceptable by countries with less government debt unless it also involved the pooling of households' financial assets. Yet, this would be legally and technically insurmountable. The EU must face forced Ricardian equivalence: the countries with the largest legacy-debt burdens must reduce them by increasing the tax burden or, alternatively, reduce their budget expenditure.
The so-called Ricardian equivalence suggests that a government will have the same effect on private spending whether it raises taxes or takes on additional debt to finance higher government spending. The logic behind it is that as the government gets more indebted, people would put aside more money in expectation of higher taxes in the future. However, there is no consensus on the empirical validity of Ricardian equivalence (see Seater 1993 for a comprehensive review).
However, an obvious corollary of the Ricardian equivalence is that the countries with more government debt should also be the ones with higher accumulated savings by households. A look at the situation in the EU15 countries before the Great Recession provides some empirical support to this statement. We have compared the government debt burdens and the net financial assets of households in the EU15 countries other than Luxembourg in 2007, the last year for which full data on household financial assets is available from Eurostat. To arrive at a proxy for household NFAs we subtracted the household loan stock at the end of 2007 as per the OECD statistics database from the households' stock of financial assets1 as a percentage of GDP as calculated by Eurostat. According to Eurostat (2009), loans represent above 90% of household financial liabilities in most EU countries.
At first glance the correlation between the government debt-to-GDP ratio and the ratio of household net financial assets to GDP appeared to be rather weak, as shown in the chart below.
Figure 1. Household NFAs and government debt (2007)
Source: Eurostat, OECD, authors' calculations.
Greece
However, there is one clear outlier in the data set: Greece. Not only did it have the highest debt-to-GDP ratio among the EU15 countries, it was also the only country where government debt exceeded household net financial assets in 2007. As we know now, it was also the only country that defaulted on its government debt in the aftermath of the financial crisis, although Portugal and Ireland also required bailouts and Spain needed help to prop up its ailing banking sector. Excluding Greece from our analysis, we get a much stronger correlation with an R-squared of 0.53.
Figure 2. Household NFAs and government debt (2007)
Source: Eurostat, OECD, authors' calculations.
Finally, excluding the UK, which is the other outlier, we get a strong correlation between government debt burdens and net financial assets accumulated by households for the remaining 12 EU15 countries with an R squared value of 0.70.
Figure 3. Household NFAs and government debt (2007)
Source: Eurostat, OECD, authors' calculations.
We can thus observe that before the financial crisis hit, the countries with the highest government-debt burden were in most cases also the ones with the highest household net financial assets to GDP. The chart above also serves to debunk the still popular myth about the ‘rich Germans and poor southern Europeans'. As one can see from the above chart, measured by net financial assets to GDP, Italian households were considerably wealthier than German households in 2007, and both France and Portugal were at about the level of Germany while Spain was not far behind.
According to our estimates, at the end of 2007 the average Italian held about €53,000 worth of net financial assets while the corresponding amount owned by the average German was €37,000. The net financial assets per inhabitant in France, Spain and Portugal in 2007 were, respectively, €42,000, €23,000 and €21,000 respectively, the figures for Spain and Portugal thus below those for Germany. These figures refer to stocks of assets, not income per capita, and they are not adjusted for purchasing power parity.
Ricardo himself actually doubted whether most people were seeing the link between more debt today and higher taxes in the future. In his Essay on the Funding System he stated that if the interest agreed upon was 5%, “20 millions in one payment [or] 1 million per annum for ever ... are precisely of the same value; but the people who pay the taxes never so estimate them, and therefore do not manage their private affairs accordingly” (Ricardo 1888). However, we can look at the Ricardian equivalence from a different perspective and hypothesise that higher government indebtedness just allows people in the respective country to accumulate more savings. Either way, we see empirical support for the claim that higher government debt goes together with larger net financial assets accumulated by people in the respective country.
Conclusion
The above findings have important implications for any suggestions to share legacy government debt burdens in the EU. As higher government-debt burdens have apparently let households in the respective countries accumulate larger financial wealth, any pooling of legacy debt would be considered unacceptable by the countries with less government debt unless it also involved pooling of the financial assets of households. The latter would probably face insurmountable legal and technical obstacles, though. Thus, the only way forward in the EU appears to be that of a forced Ricardian equivalence – the countries with the largest legacy-debt burdens in the EU will have to reduce them by increasing the tax burden on their households or, alternatively, reducing budget expenditure or raising revenue from privatisation of public assets.

Northwestern Engineering is launching a new Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program to develop leaders who can create powerful AI systems that integrate with workflows, business applications, and human interactions.
This unique 15-month, full-time program was developed in response to increased demand from industry for computer scientists who understand AI systems and the problems they can potentially solve.
The curriculum will focus on essential AI skills — machine learning, natural language understanding, and automated decision-making — but will also include coursework in the psychology of human interaction with intelligent systems, business and workflow needs, design thinking, and cognitive modeling.
“Companies and institutions need intelligent tools that go beyond simple analytics and allow users and researchers to interact with and explore their data,” said Kris Hammond, professor of computer science and director of the program. “Our program is unique in that students will leave with both technical skills and a high-level view of how to design and implement innovative applications using these technologies.”
“Northwestern Engineering's strength in computer science and our connections with faculty across campus make this the ideal home for this innovative program,” said Julio M. Ottino, dean of Northwestern Engineering. “Students will need to be whole-brain thinkers — understanding not only how to develop these systems but how these technologies relate to humans and organizations as a whole. It is an exciting time for this field, and we are ready to educate the next generation of leaders.”
Artificial intelligence is widely seen as a major force in our future economy and workforce. The recent combination of big data, improved machine learning algorithms, and more powerful computers have led to advances in everything from self-driving cars to automated personal assistants on our cell phones. These technologies have the ability to disrupt nearly every field. According to a recent study from Accenture, AI could double annual economic growth rates by 2035, and AI technologies are projected to boost labor productivity by up to 40 percent by changing the way work is done.
Students in the program will be at the forefront of this revolution by gaining experience through internship opportunities at external companies or in full-time summer positions within Northwestern AI labs. In the final quarter, students will focus on capstone projects in conjunction with industry partners.
The program builds on Northwestern Engineering's strengths in cognitive science and artificial intelligence research. Faculty include:
Hammond and Larry Birnbaum, professors of computer science who co-founded Narrative Science, a company that uses artificial intelligence to extract the most important information from a data source and turn it into a narrative expressed in natural language.
Ken Forbus, Walter P. Murphy Professor of Computer Science who conducts research in qualitative reasoning, analogical reasoning and learning, sketch understanding, natural language understanding, and cognitive architecture.
Jennie Rogers, Lisa Wissner-Slivka and Benjamin Slivka Junior Professor in Computer Science who optimizes the performance of database workloads and conducts research in encoded storage for array databases.

GLOBAL BANKING ORGANISATION HSBC has confirmed that its servers were hit by a denial of service attack last night that took down a number of its websites, and the Anonymous group has been quick to take credit.
The firm does not know why it was targeted. A Twitter account called @Fawkessecurity has taken credit for the attack and has posted a statement to Pastebin.
"As some of you may be aware HSBC bank suffered several DDoS attacks on the named sites in the past hours us.hsbc.com hsbc.co.uk hsbc.com hsbc.ca they were all brought down by #FawkesSecurity," it says. "The proof is all in our Twitter account, Targets, time and date :) @FawkesSecurity".
A Youtube video has also been released, but no reason for the attack has been revealed.
According to HSBC's statement, no customer data was affected but customers will have struggled to access its online systems. The firm has told the authorities and is working with them on tracking down the culprits.
"HSBC servers came under a denial of service attack which affected a number of HSBC websites around the world. This denial of service attack did not affect any customer data, but did prevent customers using HSBC online services, including internet banking," it said in a statement.
"We are taking appropriate action, working hard to restore service. We are pleased to say that some sites are now back up and running. We are cooperating with the relevant authorities and will cooperate with other organisations that have been similarly affected by such criminal acts. We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers throughout the world."
The websites recovered a few hours later and HSBC says that everything is now back to normal. It thanked customers for their patience.
Update
While the HSBC statement claims that no customer data has been affected, the Fawkessecurity Twitter account claims otherwise.
In a statement it disputed the bank, saying, "This isn't entirely correct. We also managed to log 20,000 debit card details." µ
Starting Monday, June 19, 2017, the Department of Transport (DOTr) will be starting the PUV Modernization Program. This program seeks to lift the standards of public utility vehicles in the country. Last month, the government agency has outlined a proposal for the changes to be made in these vehicles.
The DOTr said that the current state of PUVs in the country is outdated and dangerous. At the moment, it is yet to be known if the DOTr's proposals will be put into action. Among the changes announced is the addition of more safety equipment in PUVs, and cleaner engines, just to name a few. Buses, mini-buses, UVs and Filcabs will be part of these sweeping changes.
Among their plans, all vehicles that will be used as public transport must have curbside entry, meaning UVs and Filcabs should be having their entry points moved to the side. Their proposal also requires that city and mini buses must have low entry points for easier entry and egress, as well as PWD access. Another thing mentioned in the proposal is the use of Euro 4 engines for all PUVs.
On top of those, the DOTr's proposal sees safety and security features for PUVs. The agency is pushing for anti-lock brakes for these vehicles, as well as a speed limiter. If the vehicle is not equipped with one, it will not be registered and not be allowed to serve as a PUV. The proposal also sees the requirement of a tracking device, as well as an automated fare collection system. The DOTr is also aiming to get CCTVs and dash cameras fitted in all PUVs. Lastly, the agency promises to add free Wi-Fi for the convenience city bus and mini bus passengers.
More details will be known once the program is set in motion.
It is the No. 1 barrier to entry for young, would-be homebuyers: credit. Millennials are the first generation to come of age in a post-almost-apocalyptic housing market, where lenders, eight years later, are still paying billions in reparations for mortgage misconduct and outright fraud.
Millennial homebuyers are also paying a price.
"The mortgage industry is poised to experience a monumental shift as more millennial homebuyers begin to enter the market," said Joe Tyrrell, executive vice president of corporate strategy at Ellie Mae, a mortgage software and data company. "There are roughly 87 million would-be homebuyers in the millennial generation and 91 percent of them say they intend to own a home one day. Lenders must prepare today to meet their needs."
While millennials are waiting longer to get married and have children, factors that are the primary drivers of homeownership, the leading edge is now entering the housing market. Millennials are even starting to move to the suburbs, and in fact, last year marked a turning point, where urban centers reached "peak millennial," according to a new study from Dowell Myers, a professor of urban planning and demography at the USC Price School of Public Policy.
UPDATE ON JAN. 23: Standoff suspect, 36-year-old Tyree Wright, appeared in court Monday, and broke down in tears as he learned he won't be getting out from behind bars anytime soon.
WRIGHT IN COURT: The man accused of beating his gf broke down in tears in court today, he is being held without bail pic.twitter.com/o50WvefASZ — Marissa Kynaston (@marissaktnv) January 23, 2017
Wright is accused of beating a woman that authorities say he forced into prostitution. He is now charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, and sex trafficking.
The judge decided to hold Wright without bail, calling the details in his arrest report horrific.
"I find it ironic that he's crying, because he wasn't crying as he was beating this woman half to death," said Judge Ann Zimmerman.
"These are just allegations, your honor," said Wright's defense team.
Wright will appear in court again next month.
ORIGINAL STORY:
LAS VEGAS (KTNV) -- Beaten and left for dead. A woman says her boyfriend forced her into prostitution and when she tried to end the relationship, he savagely beat her.
a police standoff near Deer Springs Way and Durango Drive Her ex-boyfriend was at the center ofWednesday night.
And now Tyree Wright is locked up at the Clark County Detention Center. His ex-girlfriend says he beat her so badly she feared she was going to die.
"I was left for dead," says Angela, who only wants to give her first name. “I'm in so much pain. It hurts so much."
Angela says her ex-boyfriend beat her so viciously he left her with a fractured skull.
"I thought I was going to die halfway through." she says.
Angela had broken up with Wright earlier this month. Last Friday, around 9 in the morning, she says Wright showed up at her door. She thought he was trying to get back together.
“Opened my door to a bouquet of flowers."
Then Angela says Wright unleashed a savage attack, beating her with a metal baton in a blood-thirsty rage.
“He came in and tackled me like a football player."
Angela tried to protect herself. She says Wright showed no mercy.
"If I didn't have my broken arm and my broken hand, my skull would be crushed and I would be brain dead or dead," Angela says.
Angela, a mom, already worked in the adult entertainment industry. She says Wright lived off the money she made.
"I am scared. I'm afraid of him. And I don't ever want to see him again."
Angela's right forearm is broken, now in a cast. Her left hand is shattered.
"I can't even bathe myself or feed myself. I need somebody with me all the time and it's so hard."
A police report released for Wright revealed that he reportedly forced her into prostitution not soon after the two began dating in July 2014.
He required her to make at least $2,500 per day and turn it over to him. If she didn't, he would beat her. Angela claims that one time he even made a video of a beating and posted it on social media.
She tried to leave him several times and moved into a new apartment in early January, hoping he would not find her. Wright allegedly texted her and told her that she had to pay him $10,000 as a "make up fee" for not working. She refused to do so.
She did not see him again until Jan. 13 when he showed up at her apartment and beat her.
January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month. Angela wants survivors to know there is hope and help.
Wright is charged with attempted murder, sex trafficking and kidnapping.
Bicycle Network chief executive Craig Richards said Melbourne's growing population of cyclists were being put at risk by government and council miserliness. "If you don't invest in the future, you get relegated to the past," Mr Richards said. "By failing to provide for bikes, Melbourne's status as Australia's leading cycling city is at stake – not to mention its health and liveability." Dangerous gaps in the city's network of bike lanes are being left unfixed, he said, forcing riders to mix with heavy traffic and putting off many would-be cyclists. Mr Richards said the Andrews government's commitment to cycling was more rhetoric than reality so far.
"The Victorian state government is make the right noises, but isn't moving quick enough," he said. "The responsibility for an integrated and connected bike network rests on the state government's shoulders. We need a clear plan for delivering a connected network of paths, so that local councils can fill key strategic gaps." The government has committed $100 million to cycling and pedestrian links but almost half-way through its first term it has yet to spend a cent of its promised Safer Cyclists and Pedestrians Fund, or even outline a project the money will go to. Traffic in Sydney Road, Brunswick. Credit:Paul Jeffers Bicycle Network has this year revived its annual Bicycle Expenditure Index, BiXE, for the first time since 2012. BiXE is a tool that compares a council's commitment to cycling by calculating its expenditure per resident.
The 2016 index has revealed a sharp decline in expenditure for some councils in the inner city, with Melbourne City Council making the heaviest cut. Melbourne's bike budget for 2016/17, which council endorsed on Tuesday night, is less than one-third what it was in 2012, at $1.71 million. The cut in spending means the council will spend $12 per resident this year, a drop of 76 per cent compared to four years ago, when it spent $50 per resident. By comparison, the City of Sydney will spend $29 per resident this year, and Brisbane and Perth $31 each.
The cities of Yarra and Port Phillip will also spend significantly less per resident on bike infrastructure compared to four years ago, BiXE found. Elsewhere, the cities of Stonnington, Maribyrnong and Moonee Valley have increased bike spending from previously low levels. Dooring Credit:Michael Clayton-Jones The sharp drop in funding for new cycling links threatens to sabotage Melbourne City Council's ambitious plan to have bicycles comprise one in four vehicles coming into the Melbourne CBD by 2020, Bicycle Network said. It will also make it more difficult to hit its goal of zero deaths or serious injury collisions by decade's end.
A spokeswoman for Melbourne City Council defended its level of commitment to cycling and said it was on track to meet its 2020 target. "Over the last four years, we have invested more than $13 million to make Melbourne a safer, more connected city for all bike riders," she said. "In that time, we have completed 90 projects and we now have more than 136 kilometres of bike lanes throughout our city. We are well on track to meet our 2020 target, with cyclists now accounting for 17 per cent of all vehicles coming into the city, which is nearly double what it was in 2008." An Andrews government spokeswoman also defended the government's record on cycling projects, saying it was focusing on encouraging cyclists to use local, low-speed alternative streets and safe cycling routes rather than major arterial roads. Projects under way include a study into separated bike lanes on St Kilda Road, new shared paths at Chandler Highway, Swan Street and Footscray's Shepherd Bridge and the completion of the Darebin Creek Trail.

We are leaving Embedded Vision for a while (we will come back to it, as it is a wide topic) and will now look at another way to use the Zynq SoC's PS (Processor System) and PL (Programmable Logic) sections by employing National Instruments' (NI's) LabVIEW and high-level synthesis. To do this, we will be using NI's LabVIEW RIO Evaluation Kit, which is based on a Zynq Z7020 SoC. NI's RIO is supported by NI's LabVIEW Real Time application and LabVIEW FPGA. Over the next few weeks we be creating designs using this framework.
At this point I should add that developing for the Zynq this way is new to me, so it will be interesting for me to learn how to develop designs using this approach along with you over the next few blogs.
You can choose from one of three possible development methods for NI's RIO Evaluation kit as shown below:
Available Development Frameworks for NI's RIO Evaluation Kit
These three different methods allow us to best develop our system totally within the LabVIEW framework, entirely in C/C++, or using a combination of LabVIEW and C/C++. This provides flexibility allows us to pick the best approach for the particular application requirements of each new project. It's really nice to have that flexibility.
I find the RIO evaluation kit architecture interesting. The kit is based on NI's sbRIO-9637, where the “sb” stands for “single board.” The sbRIO-9637 provides USB and SD Card interfaces and it uses the Zynq SoC's EMIO extension into the PL to provide a number of hardware interfaces including CAN, RS232, RS485, and GigE. (The image below shows the board architecture.) The board also uses the Zynq SoC's XADC to provide a number of analog inputs as well as four analog outputs and 28 digital IO lines from the Zynq SoC's PL.
sbRIO-9637 Board Architecture
The RIO Development Kit combines the sbRIO-9637 board with a demo board that contains the following:
LCD Character Display
Quadrature Encoder
Potentiometer
User LEDs
Temperature Senor
5 push buttons
6 Analogue Inputs
2 Analogue Outputs
4 digital IO lines
Top of the NI RIO Evaluation Kit board showing LCD, etc.
NI RIO Evaluation Kit Board arrangement – Boards are connected via MIO and DIO connectors
These I/O resources should allow us to develop some pretty interesting applications that will familiarize us with the development framework.
Because the LabVIEW RIO development framework differs significantly from what we have used before, the first thing we need to do to get this kit up and running is install the software. The kit includes two DVDs: the first is the evaluation kit software and needs to be installed before we can develop designs for the board; the second is the LabVIEW FPGA Xilinx tools DVD.
Now here is where it gets really cool. We can either install the second DVD or we can use the cloud based FPGA compile service (use of this is required if using Win 8 or 10). My internet connection is pretty slow, so I will install the second DVD and will run all of the software locally. Although I promise to try and use the cloud compile at least once if possible to see how it works.
Installing the first disk is pretty simple. We need to ensure the evaluation kit is connected to our router so it can be validated and so that we obtain the IP address, which we will need for future developments.
Once the software is installed, we'll look at creating our first application—which I will address next time.
The code is available on Github as always.

AMERICAN blues musician B.B. King has been rushed to hospital in Las Vegas due to a diabetes-related emergency.
The blues guitarist has cancelled the remaining eight performances of his current tour after being diagnosed with dehydration and exhaustion.
King's official website says he fell ill Friday evening during a performance at the House of Blues in Chicago and was evaluated by a doctor.
The end of his tour was to include stops next week at his own B.B. King Blues Club and Grill in New York.
His representative told TMZ he was still in a “medical care facility near his home” as of Monday.
The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer is 89 and has released over 50 albums.
No further updates on his condition were provided.
Earlier this year, King issued a public apology to fans after an erratic performance in St. Louis led to audience catcalls and early departures.
His publicists called it “a bad night for one of America's living blues legends.”
King was also forced to cancel shows last year after he got sick during a show at the House of Blues in Chicago. At the time, his doctors diagnosed him with dehydration and suffering from exhaustion, and recommended he cancel the remaining shows for the year.
According to Ultimate Classic Rock website, King's career dates back to 1949, when he released his first single.
Over the years, he's recorded with rock icons like Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones and U2.
He last released an album in 2008, One Kind Favor.
Rolling Stone magazine ranked kim at No. 6 on its 2011 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.
Within a decade, commuters will be travelling on GO trains powered by electricity and they'll have to wait only 15 minutes for one to show up, says Transportation Minister Glen Murray. Murray and Premier Kathleen Wynne were at an Etobicoke train maintenance centre on Thursday to promise a regional express system in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area and beyond that will dramatically cut existing commute times.
Currently GO trains run every half-hour on the Lakeshore lines. ( Rene Johnston / Toronto Star file photo ) At a news conference with Transportation Minister Glen Murray on Thursday, Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne said it is a priority for her government to improve transit into Toronto's downtown core.

It is all part of the minority Liberal government prebudget rollout and adds details to an announcement earlier this week where Wynne pledged $29 billion in dedicated transit funds. The budget is May 1 , and if it falls on a confidence vote, an election would come shortly after. GO trains would run “all day in both directions every 15 minutes,” Murray said. “This competes now with the standards set in Paris, London in the United Kingdom and gives us 15-minute rapid rail service all across every corner of the GTHA (Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area). “This will double the ridership of GO over the next decade.”

GO released a $4-million study in 2011 that put the cost of electrifying the Georgetown and Lakeshore lines at about $1.8 billion. Metrolinx anticipates that GO's ridership of about 65 million trips a year will double by 2031. Murray said, for example, the GO train trip from Danforth to Union stations will take nine minutes as opposed to 28 minutes by TTC, and 18 minutes from Kennedy to Union stations or almost 20 minutes less than by the TTC. Trains currently run every half-hour only on the Lakeshore line. Wynne said it is a priority for her government to improve transit into Toronto's downtown core. “When I think about the convenience we are aspiring to, it's the notion that you could show up at a station knowing that within the next 10 to 15 minutes there is going to be a train come by,” she said.
“This is about commuters, it is about congestion on the roads and it's about convenience and helping people in their lives.” NDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the biggest question surrounding this transit plan is “will it happen?”

“We are not getting any details from the Liberals. Lots of promises, but few details. I think they have a very bad track record when it comes to fulfilling their promises,” she said. Murray said the system will gradually move from diesel to electric multiple-unit vehicles which can travel much more quickly; the Lakeshore line would probably be done first. “We brought in a team from the U.K. and we consulted with our friends in France and they describe this as a regional surface subway because it is that kind of frequency,” he said. Murray said the increased ridership will hopefully translate into a decrease in the provincial GO subsidy. The new transit fund is expected to reallocate $1.2 billion of the $2.39 billion the province collects in gasoline taxes as well as another $130 million from the HST the government collects on gas and diesel fuel. “We know there is an economic imperative to get this right and make sure that people can move around this region and beyond, and that's why we are making this investment,” Wynne said. “We must continue to upgrade this system. Otherwise we are not going to have the economic prosperity that we need and we know we are capable of.”

The Seattle Science Festival 2013 ended on Saturday with it's closing night program, Our 11th Hour: Straight Talk on Climate Change from People Who Know with world-leading experts on climate change: Dr. Kevin Trenberth, Dr. Richard Alley and New York Times journalist Andrew Revkin, followed by a 30-minute opera on environmental stewardship, Heron and the Salmon Girl, performed by Seattle Opera and Seattle Opera's Youth Chorus. The evening was emceed by environmental journalist Usha McFarling. The program focused on climate change and more importantly, how we can better understand the scientific data on how the Earth's climate is changing. And the data points to a dire environmental outlook. The U.N. has identified energy and food as the two biggest things leading to future sustainability that must be solved, according to Richard Alley. "A lot of the food problem is energy," Alley said in an interview before the event's main program. He said that in the U.S., out of 2,000 calorie diet, we use over 200,000 calories a day to power ourselves. What we generate internally from food is less than one percent of what we use externally. And of all these other issues, getting the energy issue in control would be the biggest step of the many steps that need to be taken [to create a sustainable planet]. Alley added, "The question is how can we generate the good that we're getting from the energy now without changing the climate in the long term."
I was very fortunate to have a rare, one-on-one interview before the scheduled main part of the program with Andrew Revkin, one of the panel speakers. Revkin is Senior Fellow for Environmental Understanding at Pace University. He writes the award-winning Dot Earth blog for the Op-Ed section of the New York Times. Revkin is a veteran environmental journalist, and has covered major world environmental challenges from the Amazon rain forest, the Arctic and the politics of climate change. The following is the transcript of my interview.
Michael Venables: Rick Smalley mentioned in a 2003 lecture that by mid century world will need to generate 10 terawatts of cheap energy. Is there a safe, responsible way to do this with nuclear power?
Andrew Revkin: What I do see in America is a lack of serious engagement to move things forward. There is so much resistance to nuclear power, generally, in this country, some of which is the result of demographics. The people who support mainstream environmental groups mostly grew up in the shadow of Three Mile Island or Chernobyl and they just are not ready. And, whether or not the logic is there, or the science is there, or the technology is there, they are not ready -- politically, in terms of policy. And, as long as we don't have anything to push people away from coal . . . and natural gas is cheaper now. I've written about this recently. Cheap natural gas, which I'm not against, but in reality, that's going to limit prospects for both nuclear and renewables. In this country we're bad at developing policies to advance those technologies, even with the cheap alternative. If there's cheap electricity we'll just go with it. So, I don't see a lot of prospects at moving forward. Smalley's work has been very influential for me. I wrote about it from the beginning. And what he said, and what I think is still true, is that we're not remotely engaged at the level of basic inquiry in the sciences related to energy, where you would need to invest. Essentially, except for the energy crisis in the '70s, we've always had a dribble of basic investment in basic science. RD&D, the research, development, and demonstration on energy is a few billion dollars a year, constant dollars. It's not enough. And, it's been a bipartisan slumber party on the need to do something more. So it's not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It's just how we do things.
Venables: Can the knowosphere drive enough collaboration and innovation to foster communicative action towards our pressing issues of the decline of Earth's biodiversity, human-driven climate change and the ivory trade, not just carbon issues?
Revkin: The "knowosphere" is essentially connectivity. And if you have a culture where people are interested in using that to improve life, then we've never had better potential to have fast forwarding of both shaping idea, making a good idea better and sharing ideas, getting the right information to the right place at the right time. That's as true for telemedicine as it is for having more global enterprise in science. There was a recent study about co-authorship in the journals. You are seeing more and more international co-authorship because people are more networked. And that'a always good thing. Although the systems also are used to sell stuff, and to foment hatred and to make people angry. So it's not a no-brainer. But one reason I moved to academia is to try to develop courses where students learn to focus on the upside of all that connectivity.
Venables: Explain "Bend, Stretch, Reach, Teach, Reveal, Reflect, Rejoice, Repeat" and it's promise for resolving environmental issues.
Revkin: Recently, I summarized some of the basic traits and approaches to life on earth that I can think make a difference. And, yeah, it was sort of simplistic, almost like a nursery rhyme. And it's not like some great, unique thought. It's just a way of articulating vital traits in a complicated century, where things we don't know are just as important as things we do know. And "Bend" is flexibility. Basically not being brittle, making sure systems are not brittle. "Stretch" is a culture of innovation and a culture of exploration. "Reach" is collaboration. "Teach" is obviously making sure kids know how to learn. And the rest of them essentially break down the idea that you have to have a discipline to this. That evaluation of progress, in other words "pause and reflect" is really important. We don't do that a lot. If you pass a bill, it's done. The Endangered Species Act hasn't been revisited in a long time. It's got real problems. So how do you build in the capacity to do that. And then "Repeat," which is the rigor to normalize never resting on your laurels. Because we're not in a situation in the planet right now where it's not like you're going to solve the climate problem or solve energy poverty. You're going to have to address these issues in a sustained way. It's just one way of breaking down the challenge.
Venables: If not social movements for climate change aren't enough, how do you think science can best inform environmental policy and combat an environment of denialism, cultural cognition, hyperbolic discounting and informational ennui? Is the "Super Wicked" approach the answer?
Revkin: Well, a lot of scientists and scientific organizations have had the longstanding presumption that more information will just change things if you just keep national academies report or a new IPCC report. Or for me, frankly, as a science communicator, (this is one of the things I talk about here) is the expectation: why would I be a journalist if I didn't think information mattered? But the more I've reported on our behavioral tendencies to absorb or reject information based on character, just our characteristics, personality, upbringing, even biology. You know, you start to realize that if you're just going to keep telling stories, and you're not focused on those realities, you're going to miss the boat. Why would I spend the rest of my life doing what I did for the first twenty-five years of my career knowing the limits of information. And, so I've tried to make sure, I've tried to explain to people, using communication, that if you're not focused on that body of science, the science of science communication, the science of how people absorb or reject information, then you're going to be hitting a lot of walls. And there is no magic solution, I think, except -- experimentation and communication is really important right now too. If you're not testing different approaches to getting an idea across then you're missing, probably, big opportunities. And there's never been a better time to do that. Visualization of data. There are so many cool ways to go at that. There are great experiments under way. There's a website called visualizing.org, that's kind of a laboratory for new ideas of how to do that. And, the more of that, the better.
Venables: You've been accused of being too much of a centrist, and of not taking a stand, and of being sanguine, by David Roberts of Grist. How would you rationalize that in an era when people take dramatic, empathetic stands toward environmental policy and how would you defend yourself?
Revkin: Well, for one thing, there is somewhat of a tendency to say the middle is a safe place to be, but it's the least safe place, because you are being shot at from every direction. I don't migrate to a point of rationality because it's safer. I migrate there because I'm trying to follow the data. And that means paying attention to uncertainty as much as what we know. It means making sure that you're not centric about your approach to an issue like climate risk. There are so many drivers of risk and hazard zones around the world right now. I just wrote this weekend again about the fires in Colorado. And if you just focus on the climate component, you miss the fact that some of these areas have had quadrupled populations in the last 40 years. All of these homes were built in areas that were fundamentally incendiary and the idea that it's breaking news that they're burning is kind of, when you look at the realities of that, and then you think about what we know about climate change, it's pretty funky in terms of what contribution to those fires is coming from the extra heating and drying from global warming, amid all the natural variability. But the thing that has no uncertainty at all is quadrupling of risk, through just the number of homes in harms way. So I just try to follow that stuff and it leads to uncomfortable places that make some people frustrated, but it's just reality.
The complexities of resolving the challenge of global warming stretch across government policy, trends in consumption, population change and even the battle over interpreting the scientific data. The global strategic importance of environmental issues has also been highlighted in the press recently. Political activists and environmental groups have been under the scrutiny of the NSA since 2008, according to a recent Guardian report. The Department of Defense's (DoD) Army Modernization Strategy outlined in a July 2008 document feared an impending, intractable conflict over water, food and energy because of exhausted resources and depleted overseas markets. Clearly, the global environmental fallout from climate change follows neither political constraints nor national boundaries. As Alley mentioned in his panel talk, the issue of climate change "affects everybody, not just one side of the aisle."
Trenberth reminded the Seattle Science Festival 2013 audience that the Earth is not well. Her elevated temperature from the increasing carbon dioxide levels in her atmosphere is caused by all of us. The prognosis, he added, is more global warming at disruptive rates that could cause strife. Trenberth said that the treatment for Earth's environmental malady is mitigation, reducing emissions and adaptation, planning for the consequences. And, we are not doing enough of either of these "treatments." Trenberth emphasized that scientific data solidly supports a trend of "global heating," causing Earth's rising surface temperatures from carbon dioxide that is trapped in our planet's atmosphere. The ocean's are rising as they absorb this heat, melting glacial ice packs
What I learned from Andrew Revkin is that it is incumbent on all of us to take responsibility for reducing our carbon footprint. It isn't as simple as reading the scientific data on the environmental issues of the day and having a knee-jerk reaction to save the planet. It's a more introspective journey that demands a much deeper, critical reckoning of our daily living routines that burn the Earth's finite resources, effecting the future good and health of our planet and everyone who comes after us. A quote attributed to Rousseau explains it well: "To live is not merely to breathe: it is to act; it is to make use of our organs, senses, faculties — of all those parts of ourselves which give us the feeling of existence." Dialogue on the challenges facing Earth's environment -- among government agencies, activist groups and citizens is essential. But any dialogue, without critical reflection of how we arrived at our shared environmental crisis, without taking responsibility for our own carbon habits and without our acting to change them, is meaningless.

Labour leader says that his party 'are interested in innovative solutions' to the railways but says it has to be 'affordable'
Ed Miliband suggested yesterday that Labour may favour taking some rail franchises back into public ownership when he spoke of his support for "innovative solutions".
The Labour leader told the Guardian that the renegotiation of a rail franchise could mark the moment when a line could be taken into public ownership as he cited the example of the East Coast line.
Miliband said: "We are interested in innovative solutions when it comes to the railways. It's got to be affordable. That is absolutely definite. The experience of East Coast, which has been in public hands, has been a good experience.
"The government is dogmatically wanting to privatise East Coast. I don't think you should approach this issue with dogma on either side. So we are interested in innovative solutions."
Asked whether it would make more sense to allow franchises to be taken back into public ownership when they expire, Miliband said: "You're right to say we've got to look at these issues around the franchises. There are different models you can use. You can have a competitive model where there is a public option like there is in East Coast at the moment. So we are looking at different models for this."
Miliband was also strongly supportive of Sir David Higgins, the new HS2 chairman, as he made clear Labour would be supporting the hybrid bill for the construction of the first stage of the line. He said: "The recent report by David Higgins was a step forward not only because of issues of cost but because he is on to the idea that there are issues about connections across the country as well as the connections to London. He is looking more creatively about how you make this work."
An ancient line of female salamanders has managed to do away with the need for mating with males, and has developed increased regenerative powers in the process.
They may not be able to heal themselves instantly, but the salamanders show an increased capacity to grow back tails that have been lost to accidents or predators, according to a recent study in the Journal of Zoology.
On average, their tails grew back 36 per cent faster than a normal salamander's after being chopped off. That's a huge competitive advantage as bigger animals look for a snack. The faster you can grow your tail back, the faster you can present it to a predator as an alternative to your head, or other important appendages.
This all-female line of fast healers — part of the broader species of Ambystoma salamanders native to large sections of North America including Canada — is interesting even without its enhanced regeneration. Scientists have discovered that the animals reproduce themselves through cloning, effectively eliminating the need for any messy mating.

Normally, cloning starts to become a problem after several generations because of the lack of fresh material in the gene pool. But this particular gang of ladies has been around for a very long time. They've managed to evolve a unique mechanism to swipe DNA from “sperm packets” deposited by males during the normal reproductive process.
The unisexual amphibians are then able to use the stolen sperm to trigger an egg to divide, but it doesn't actually fertilize the egg, and may or may not contribute chromosomes to the offspring. In other words, the baby salamanders don't end up with any of the unwilling sperm donors' genes.
Scientists have playfully dubbed it “sneaky sex,” but the formal term is kleptogenesis.
The municipality of Chiasso in Switzerland is to start accepting tax payments in bitcoin, according to a local news report.
The new scheme, to be put into place for the start of next year, was apparently made following discussion with various blockchain groups based in the area.
There are limits to the scheme, however, and tax payments made in bitcoin cannot exceed 250 Swiss francs (around $265), the report states.
The Mayor of Chiasso, Bruno Arrigoni, was cited as saying that the town is “recognised internationally as an epicentre of a growing technological and economic growth for both the canton and in Switzerland.”
Nicknamed the “CryptoPolis,” Chiasso is set on establishing itself as a rival to the country's blockchain epicentre Zug, and has reportedly seen eight startups set up base there in the past few months.
Zug, which has become famous internationally as Switzerland's “Cryptovalley,” announced it would allow citizen to pay for government services in digital currencies back in 2016. However, Zug has not made any move to integrate bitcoin tax payments as an option for its inhabitants.

Longshot's bid underscores Boxer's tight race CAMPAIGN 2010 U.S. Senate Race

In a year when Tea Party activists and the GOP are getting a lot of attention, self-described "common sense Democrat" Mickey Kaus is stirring up a little party of his own - challenging U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer in the Democratic primary over illegal immigration and public employee unions' pensions.
"It's clear that the unions own the Democratic party - and it's going to be a disaster unless that changes," says Kaus, 58, a longtime blogger for online magazine Slate.com and author of "The End of Equality," which urges a rethinking of liberalism.
Instead of "chasing after the Latino vote" and pushing for public "card check" elections intended to make it easier for workers to join labor unions, he said his party and Boxer - whom he calls an "old-style pol, through and through" - should deal with issues that affect the everyday lives of working Californians.
"Do the vast majority of Californians want to do away with the secret ballot in union elections? No," he said. "And the huge number of voters here don't want immediate amnesty for undocumented immigrants - until the border is secure."
Kaus' campaign against Boxer, who has been called one of the Senate's most liberal members, is a longshot in blue California. But his bid underscores challenges for California's junior senator.
Poll shows dead heat
With three weeks until the June 8 primary, the latest Rasmussen poll showed Boxer in a 42-41 percent dead heat with GOP challenger Tom Campbell, the former South Bay Congressman. In the poll released Friday, Boxer does only slightly better against two other GOP challengers, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and Assemblyman Chuck DeVore of Irvine.
Speaking to reporters last week, Boxer acknowledged the challenges of her re-election effort.
"Will this be a hard race? Oh, my God, yes ... very hard," she said.
Even as President Obama prepares to come to the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco on May 25 to star in the second Boxer fundraiser in a month, the Los Angeles Times delivered a stinging slap when it refused to endorse her in the Democratic Senate primary - saying she "lacks the intellectual firepower" for the job.
Democratic pollster Ben Tulchin says Boxer has always faced tough races, and "her polls have always been under 50 percent every campaign until the end." But he acknowledged that the campaign for the November general election "is going to be Barbara's toughest race since 1992."
'Seat-of-the-pants' bid
Kaus said he launched his uphill, "seat-of-the-pants" bid against Boxer because she's been too lockstep with the party's biggest donors while ignoring its base voters.
A graduate of Harvard Law School who clerked for Judge Stanley Mosk of the California Supreme Court and whose father, Otto Kaus, served on the state's high court, Kaus says he is a loyal Democrat: He likes President Obama's health care reform plan, supports same-sex marriage and is pro-choice and pro-government - including tough environmental regulations.
Kaus says most Democrats don't support efforts to roust millions of illegal immigrants from the United States because the immigrants are "good people who contribute greatly to the state's economy." But, he says, "we just don't want another 12 million" because the costs are too high.
His solutions: aggressive efforts that include extending and strengthening border fences to slow the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as better electronic checks by employers to send the message of tougher consequences.
Kaus also said the party's allegiance to big unions ignores Californians who are alarmed over the estimated $500 billion shortfall in funding future public employee pensions.
Unions aristocracy
In California, "labor is the new aristocracy - everyone else is sweating away at $10-an-hour jobs while unions have defended their benefits," he said. Public workers unions "are no longer the oppressed class; in a two-tier system, they are the upper tier," he said.
"People realize that the government machine is run for the unions," Kaus said. "The libraries can close, but you can't cut those pensions."
Boxer's campaign manager, Rose Kapolczynski, predicted defeat for the challenger.
"It's a free country, and anyone can run for office, but I'm confident that Sen. Boxer's base remains strong and she will easily win the Democratic primary," Kapolczynski said.
Patrick Dorinson, who writes the cowboylibertarian.com blog, said besting Boxer is near "Mission Impossible," but such messages connect with moderate Democrats and the 1 in 5 state voters who declined to state a political party in their voter registration.
Boxer has "faced an electorate before in good times," he said. "But this time, it's tough times."

About
"I Hope Senpai Will Notice Me" is a catchphrase commonly associated with anime shows and manga books that can often be found on the microblogging site Tumblr to express a quest to resolve unrequited admiration. Images utilizing this catchphrase will sometimes feature superimposed cherry blossoms, meant to represent romance , and anime-style facial expressions.
Origin
Senpai , sometimes spelled "sempai", is a Japanese honorific term used when speaking to someone of an elevated social status in schools, dojos or sports clubs. The term is usually reserved for mentors, and does not apply to authority figures such as teachers or bosses. Romantic anime and manga often feature stories involving infatuations with senpai. While the senpai concept had already been mentioned on Tumblr , the specific catchphrase did not appear until August 8th, 2012, when the single serving site "Has Senpai Noticed Me Yet?" was created.
Spread
Following the launch of the "Has Senpai Noticed Me Yet?" blog, Tumblr users began utilizing the tags senpai , sempai and "I hope senpai will notice me" to share text posts and image macros with the phrase. On August 12th, an ask blog from the point of view of Senpai was created. Over the next three days, blogs titled "I Am Senpai And I Just" , "Your Senpai Noticed You And" and "Senpai Noticed You Then" were created with the intention of utilizing Tumblr's notification feature to make joke sentences when liking and reblogging posts found on the senpai tag.
In September 2012, the Facebook fan page "I hope Senpai will notice me" was created, gaining more than 200 fans as of September 2013. The phrase has continued to be popular on Tumblr, where the tags "I hope senpai notices me" and the positive "senpai noticed me" are all active. It can also be found mentioned on deviantART , where there are more than 1,100 search results for "senpai notice me."
In January of 2014, PewDiePie created a compilation video of all the times he said "Senpai will notice me" in his vlogs; subsequently, interest in the phrase spiked.
Notable Examples
Search Interest
Though "senpai" is a common word that has seen an increase in search query volume since 2005, the keyword reached an all-time high in August of 2012, when the phrase began appearing on Tumblr.

The electric car isn't exactly thriving, but it's a lot healthier than it was in 2003. That's the year General Motors terminated leases of its EV1 electric two-seater, setting in motion the events that would form the backdrop of the documentary film, Who Killed the Electric Car?
When GM hauled its EV1 fleet off to the crusher amid protesting consumers, the car became an automotive martyr and was used as evidence of a conspiracy against EVs.
Ten years later, GM is building electric cars instead of crushing them, and the political and consumer climate has changed considerably. Filmmaker Chris Paine even made a sequel: Revenge of the Electric Car.
What about the EV1, though? Some say it was the right car at the wrong time, others say it just wasn't good enough to be commercially viable. So, did political machinations and consumer skepticism kill the EV1, or was it just not a very good car?
The EV1 was the first serious modern attempt at an electric car by a major manufacturer, but its short range and long charging times earned it a spot on Time's 2008 list of the “50 Worst Cars of All Time,” and a place of dishonor in Richard Porter's book Crap Cars.
The EV1 was somewhat of an outlier when it was actually on sale. Now, though, there are other production EVs to compare it to, giving us an idea of what the EV1 was like as a car, and whether EV technology really needed 10 years of maturation to be good enough for consumers.
The Car
The EV1 went into production in 1996 as a production successor to the Impact, a 1991 concept car. It was compact two-seater roughly the size of a contemporary Saturn SC2.
Unlike most current electric cars, the EV1 was almost entirely bespoke. It featured an aluminum space frame, aluminum suspension components, and plastic body panels, to keep weight down. It also had electric power brakes and steering; the latter is a common feature on cars of 2013.
Although all EV1s look the same, they actually belong to two generations. Gen I cars had a three-phase AC induction motor and a 16.5-kWh Delphi lead-acid battery pack. In 1999, GM released Gen II cars with 18.7-kWh Panasonic lead-acid batteries, and later upgraded them further with 26.4-kWh nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries, the same type used in the Toyota Prius and most first generation hybrids.
The EV1 was so different that it became the first car in GM history to be sold under the General Motors nameplate, instead of being assigned to one of the company's divisions (it was sold through Saturn dealers). That begs the question: Would renaming the Chevrolet Volt the General Motors Volt really increase its appeal?
Performance
While its lozenge-shaped body and digital dashboard suggested a futuristic speed machine, the EV1 performed more like an average compact car. All versions had the same electric motor, which produced 137 horsepower and 110 pound-feet of torque.
GM advertised the EV1's range as 70 to 90 miles and while, we can't drive one of the cars to confirm this, it compares favorably with current EVs on paper.
The EV1 could reportedly go from 0 to 60 mph in nine seconds, while Car and Driver's 2011 Nissan Leaf SL long-term test car did the same in 10 seconds. If the Leaf is acceptably quick, then so is the EV1.
Top speeds are also pretty close. The EV1 was electronically limited to 80 mph, while the Leaf's limiter is set at 92 mph. The EV1 also matches the Mitsubishi i-MiEV's top speed although, at 13.0 seconds to 60 mph, the Mitsubishi takes a lot longer to get there.
Charging
One of the most shocking (no pun intended) aspects of the EV1 was its short range and hours-long charging times. Ten years after the last EV1 left the road, things have improved, but haven't completely changed.
GM said the EV1 could go 70 to 90 miles on a charge, depending on conditions, which mainstream EVs haven't really bettered. The 2013 Nissan Leaf gets a 75-mile range rating from the EPA, while the Mitsubishi i-MiEV can only go 62 miles. The Honda Fit EV ekes out a slightly better performance at 82 miles.
A Gen I EV1 took approximately 15 hours to recharge from a 110-volt household outlet. GM's 220-volt MagneCharge system could do the job in three hours. By 2001, GM had installed over 1,000 MagneChargers in private homes and public locations like malls, hotels, and airports. GM encouraged customers to use the 220-volt system, and only plug into standard household outlets as a backup.
This should sound familiar. Both Nissan and Tesla are working to build national networks of public charging stations for their respective EVs. Tesla has a handful of Supercharger stations in California and on the East Coast, and hopes to open 100 by 2015. Nissan wants to have 400 of its DC quick chargers ready by next year.
The performance of these new chargers is a vast improvement over the MagneCharger. Tesla says the Supercharger can add 150 miles of range to an 85-kWh Model S in 30 minutes, while Nissan's system can charge a Leaf to 80 percent capacity in the same amount of time.
A full charge at home still takes awhile, though. A 240-volt Level 2 charger takes about four hours to charge most cars, so 2013 EV owners aren't in a much better position than 1996 Gen I EV1 lessees.
Price
In 1996, an EV1 stickered for around $35,000. That was somewhat nearer to a BMW 328i ($32,900) and about the same as a Mercedes-Benz C280 ($35,250) at the time. While that might seem like a lot for a front-wheel drive compact, it's not bad considering that the EV1 was basically hand built and shared virtually no components with other GM vehicles.
In 2013, a Nissan Leaf costs $28,800, but last year it was $6,400 more. GM's own Chevrolet Spark EV will cost around $25,000 when it goes on sale later this year. However, both 2013 EVs benefit from tax credits, including a $7,500 federal credit.
Just like in the 1990s, EVs are generally more expensive than their gasoline-powered counterparts. The Spark's $25,000 base price may be low for an electric car, but it's almost $10,000 more than a loaded 2013 Spark 2LT. The EPA consider the Leaf a midsize car, and Nissan's own midsize Altima starts at $21,760.
Did the EV1 deserve to die?
On paper (and pixels) the EV1 comes pretty close to the 2013 EV standard in terms of performance and convenience. It's impractical two-seat body and the unknown long-term reliability of its batteries are the only major drawbacks.
A 70 to 90-mile range and minimum three hour charging time also sound like drawbacks, but EV drivers in 2013 aren't much better off. Two generations of battery technology have eased, but not completely erased, range anxiety.
Today's political climate may be friendlier toward EVs, but buyers still have to decide if zero-emission motoring is worth a major sacrifice in flexibility. So, for some, the EV1 may never have been a good car. It was a good electric car though, so maybe it didn't deserve to die.
Evidence-Based Medicine: Hard For Some To Swallow
Enlarge this image toggle caption Rui Vieira/AP/PA Wire Rui Vieira/AP/PA Wire
This week two panels of medical experts recommended fewer screening tests for breast and cervical cancer. And recently, men got similar advice about prostate cancer screening.
The recommendations come from something called evidence-based medicine, and are being met with resistance from some consumer groups and physicians.
Evidence-based medicine is a pretty simple concept. "The basic principle of evidence based medicine is that clinical decisions that are made between doctors and patients should be driven by data," says Peter Bach, now a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and once an adviser to the head of the Medicare system.
"What it means is the careful application of information from well-designed studies to decide what medical practices work, and how well they work," says Alan Garber, head of the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University.
People Don't Always Listen To Data
Evidence-based medicine can be used to determine how often someone should be screened for cancer, and it can be used to determine what sort of treatment is best. But people don't always want to do what the data say to do.
As a family physician in North Carolina, Lori Heim sees that a lot. It comes up all the time with sinus infections, she says. She remembers one patient who demanded antibiotics for her viral sinusitis, even though multiple studies show that's the wrong thing to do.
"The previous doctors gave her antibiotics and she got better," Heim says. But that's probably because she would have gotten better anyway, even without the antibiotics.
Heim is president of the board of directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians, and she says her group will take a close look at the mammography recommendations announced by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force earlier this week. New information and new ways to analyze it mean that guidelines often change.
That can make patients nervous, Heim says. "They want medicine to be absolute, and perfect, and unfortunately it's not."
Decisions Based On Science
Insurers already use evidence-based medicine to some degree. The current health overhaul bills under consideration encourage it without any strict requirements. The Senate bill, for example, uses the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force as a baseline, but not as a limit, for some parts of Medicare. Both bills provide money for more research.
Economist Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University says the U.S. ought to pay more attention to evidence-based medicine. "You cannot have a health system where every doctor, every patient is completely free to use their imagination and hunches to make clinical decisions," he says.
Researchers estimate that anywhere from one half to two-thirds of current medical practice is based on concepts that have not yet been proven. And there's a history of procedures turning out to be useless. Years ago, many doctors periodically X-rayed smokers' lungs, thinking that detecting lung cancer early and starting treatment right away would reduce the death toll. But research showed that periodic X-rays didn't reduce the mortality of lung cancer among smokers.
Resisting Change
So what if people insist on mammograms in younger, lower-risk women, or lung cancer screening for smokers, or other procedures of questionable value?
"Then I would say but please why don't you go ahead and buy it," says Reinhardt, and don't depend on your health insurance or the government to pay for it.
The pushback against the mammography and pap smear recommendations shows that getting people to accept change is difficult, says Alan Garber of Stanford University. "If you come out with a study that says that something that people thought worked well maybe doesn't, that message may not go down so well," he says.
Garber is not as discouraged as some of his colleagues about the public confusion and reluctance regarding the new recommendations. He says what's needed is public education, which suggests some long study sessions and talking with your doctor.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage from Martinique shows early devastating winds
Hurricane Maria, strengthened to a "potentially catastrophic" category five storm, has torn into the Caribbean island of Dominica with sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph).
Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit posted on Facebook that his roof had been torn off and he was "at the complete mercy of the hurricane".
He said his house had flooded, later adding that he had been rescued.
Dominica's airport and ports have been closed.
Maria is moving roughly along the same track as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month.
The nearby island of Martinique has declared a maximum-level alert while another French island, Guadeloupe, ordered evacuations.
Hurricane warnings are also in place for:
Puerto Rico : The US territory expects Maria to make landfall as a category three on Tuesday. It escaped the worst of Irma and has been an important hub for getting relief to islands more badly affected. Governor Ricardo Rossello urged islanders to seek refuge
: The US territory expects Maria to make landfall as a category three on Tuesday. It escaped the worst of Irma and has been an important hub for getting relief to islands more badly affected. Governor Ricardo Rossello urged islanders to seek refuge US Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands: Both island chains suffered severe damage from Irma and President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the US territories on Monday. British authorities fear debris left behind by Irma could be whipped up by the new storm and pose an extra threat.
Warnings are also in effect for St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat and St Lucia while hurricane watches are in place for St Martin, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla.

Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Hurricane Irma - another category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage.
The islands bearing the brunt of Maria are part of the Leeward Islands chain and include Antigua and Barbuda. The latter was evacuated after being devastated by Irma.

The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) increased the strength of Maria in just a few hours on Monday from a category two storm, to a category four and then to category five - the highest level.
Forecasters warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane "could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides".

Dominica is a former British colony with a population of 72,000 about halfway between Guadeloupe and Martinique. The eye of the hurricane made landfall there at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT Tuesday), the NHC reported.
All ports and airports are closed and residents near the coast have been ordered to go to authorised shelters.
Curtis Matthew, a journalist based in the capital, Roseau, told the BBC that conditions went "very bad, rapidly".
"We are not able to even see properly what is happening on the road. The winds are very, very strong, we can hear the noise on the outside. We still don't know what the impact is going to be when this is all over. But what I can say it does not look good for Dominica as we speak," he said.
Martinique raised its alert status to "violet", the highest level, and ordered its population to seek shelter.
In Guadeloupe, schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted. The French government has ordered low-lying areas on the islands to be evacuated, AFP reports.
Image caption The Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda
The British government said more than 1,300 troops were staying put in the region and an additional military team had been deployed to the British Virgin Islands where entire neighbourhoods were flattened by Irma.
Virgin boss Richard Branson, who has a home in the Virgin Islands, has been tweeting ahead of Maria's predicted arrival, warning people to stay safe.

Irma also hit the US, where several dozen deaths were linked to the hurricane. Nearly 6.9 million homes were left without power in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Alabama.
A second hurricane, Jose, is also active in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 90mph.
The centre of Jose was about 265 miles east-south-east of Cape Hatteras in North Carolina, the NHC said in its advisory at 18:00 GMT on Monday.
PARIS — More than two and a half millennia ago, the Assyrian King Senaccherib descended on his enemies “like the wolf on the fold,” as the Bible tells us—and as Lord Byron wrote in cantering cadences memorized by countless Victorian schoolchildren: “His cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold; And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea.”
The Assyrian and Babylonian empires appear throughout the Old Testament as examples of ruthless grandeur and godless decadence. The Bible says Sennacherib's army was destroyed by the Angel of the Lord. The Israelites were carried off to Babylon, where they wept by the waters. And since the middle of the 19th century, archeologists have labored mightily to unearth the mythical and the verifiable past in the extraordinary cradle of civilizations they used to call Mesopotamia and now call Iraq.
No trace ever has been found of the Garden of Eden, said to have lain near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates, but one of the great prizes the excavators did discover was Senaccherib's capital, Nineveh, which the biblical prophet Nahum called “the city of blood, full of lies, full of plunder, never without victims!”
Last month, a new marauder descended on Nineveh and the nearby city of Mosul. He, too, came down like the wolf on the fold, but his cohorts brandished Kalashnikovs from pickup trucks, not shining spears; their banners were the black flags of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Sham.
Soon afterward the minions of the self-appointed caliph of the freshly self-declared Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, paid a visit to the Mosul Museum. It has been closed for years for restoration, ever since it was looted along with many of Iraq's other institutions in the wake of the culturally oblivious American-led invasion of 2003. But the Mosul Museum was on the verge of reopening, at last, and the full collection had been stored there.
“These groups of terrorists—their arrival was a brutal shock, with no warning,” Iraqi National Museum Director Qais Hussein Rashid told me when he visited Paris last week with a mission pleading for international help. “We were not able to take preventive measures.”
Indeed, museum curators and staff were no better prepared than any other part of the Iraqi government. They could have learned from al-Baghdadi's operations in neighboring Syria that a major source of revenue for his insurgency has been the sale of looted antiquities on the black market. As reported in The Guardian, a windfall of intelligence just before Mosul fell revealed that al-Baghdadi had accumulated a $2 billion war chest, in part by selling off ancient artifacts from captured Syrian sites. But the Iraqi officials concerned with antiquities said the Iraqi intelligence officers privy to that information have not shared it with them.
So the risk now—the virtual certainty, in fact—is that irreplaceable history will be annihilated or sold into the netherworld of corrupt and cynical collectors. And it was plain when I met with Rashid and his colleagues that they are desperate to stop it, but have neither the strategy nor the resources to do so.
“We as Iraqis are incapable of controlling the situation by ourselves,” Abbas Qureishi, director of the “recovery” program for the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, told me. It's not just a matter of the museums, he said. Mosul is in the middle of 1,791 registered archeological sites, including four capitals of the Assyrian empire. “The Iraqi army will be obliged to conduct operations next to these archeological sites,” said Qureishi. The jihadists “will destroy them and say the Iraqi army bombed these sites.”
“So we are asking Americans and Europeans—especially Americans—to understand the gravity of the situation,” said Qureishi, and “to put pressure on the governments of their countries to intervene militarily.”
I said I thought that was highly unlikely.
“Here's the thing,” said Qureishi. “In a traditional military engagement, tanks and artillery will damage a site.” Indeed, the shells might obliterate it. But “U.S. drones have very precise munitions which can hit targets without destroying the [archeological] sites nearby.”
(Predators and Hellfires like stars on the sea …)
This, we all know, is not going to happen. Nothing about the Obama administration's toe in the noxious Iraqi water suggests it will commit major resources to saving the current government of the grossly incompetent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, much less the ancient stones of Nineveh.
The excavations of the last 170 years found Senaccherib's “Palace Without Rival.” They discovered enormous winged bulls and winged lions with the faces of men, and they carted away the extraordinarily beautiful lion-hunt bas-reliefs that are in the British Museum. But there is so much more to find, so much of such phenomenal beauty and historical importance, that a visitor to those ancient precincts might feel as if he or she were in touch physically, mystically with the world described in the Old Testament. If only the stones could survive.
And it's not just the monumental sculptures that are in danger, but thousands of artifacts and, also, ancient manuscripts from the many cultures—Islamic, Christian, and pagan—that inhabited the region of Mosul when it sat astride the caravan route that led from the Far East into the Near East and Europe.
Soon after al-Bagdhadi's men arrived in Mosul, they told the museum staff that the ancient statues were “against Islam.” But then they left the building. The collections remained unmolested for several days, and the initial reports that the statues had been smashed appear to have been erroneous. The photographs of shattered sculptures that circulated on the Web actually came from Syria, according to local officials in Mosul. But the caliphate's gauleiters issued a city charter and declared in its Article 13 that “false idols” would have to be destroyed.
For this strain of Sunni Muslim jihadists, any representation of the human form (with the apparent exception of their own propaganda videos), any shrine that might lend itself to idolatry, and any place of worship dedicated to the faith of supposedly heretical Shia Muslims must be obliterated.
And so, day by day, night by night, the demolition teams and bulldozer drivers of the so-called Islamic State have gone about their work.
First the statue of a beloved local poet and the tomb of a great Arab historian fell to the caliphate's wrecking crews. The world paid little attention.
“The worst thing about wars is that they do not distinguish between the past and the future,” Mosul calligrapher and conservationist Abdallah Ismail told a local correspondent for the German-funded publication Niqash.org. He suggested that the shrewd new rulers of the city were “taking the pulse” of the local population to see how it would react to their appetite for destruction.
The caliphate's troops “have removed statues of people that the city is really proud of,” said Ismail, “but they haven't done anything to statues like the Assyrian winged bull, which are thousands of years old and which look far more like idol worship than these other monuments.”
“The people of Mosul have not reacted,” said Ismail. “They act as if these things are going on in another city, not their own.”
So al-Baghdadi's men have picked up the pace, attacking and destroying one Shia mosque and shrine after another. Eventually, locals reportedly resisted by surrounding one mosque and throwing rocks, but that was during the day, and the caliphate just brought back the bulldozer during the night.
Then, last week, al-Baghdadi's men returned to the Mosul Museum. They broke the lock to the storage rooms, and they have occupied the building ever since. “They say they are awaiting instructions from their guide [al-Baghdadi] to destroy these statues,” says Rashid, the National Museum director who is in touch with the local staff. Typically, al-Baghdadi is looking for the moment when he can get the most global attention.
Maybe this all sounds very distant. But the jihadist appetite for violent iconoclasm already has proved to be tremendously dangerous for the West. Those who claim to speak for a vengeful Allah take great delight in smashing idols wherever and whenever they can get to them. Theirs is a war of symbols. In early 2001 the Afghan Taliban, encouraged by al Qaeda, blew to bits the towering Buddhas of Bamiyan. Western leaders wrung their hands but took no substantive action. A few months later, the jihadists attacked some of the most spectacular icons in the world: the skyscrapers of the World Trade Center in New York City.
State Department Employees Cleared to Watch WikiLeaks Movie
Ever since WikiLeaks.org began releasing thousands of classified cables, State Department employees have been forbidden from visiting the website without explicit authorization. (Sure, it was a silly prohibition given the proliferation of mainstream newspaper stories based on the WikiLeaks cables, but them's the rules). So how about viewing WikiLeaks the movie?
Not a problem, the State Department tells The Cable. Watching the hotly anticipated WikiLeaks drama Fifth Estate will not place employees on the naughty list.
“The department hasn't issued any sort of guidance on the movie, so there would be no prohibition against the movie,” a State Department official said of the film, which debuts nationwide on Friday. “Employees would be free to watch whatever movie they're interested in.”
For foreign services officers taken with Benedict Cumberbatch, the rising-star actor whose portrayal of WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange is earning rave reviews, it's good news.
For Julian Assange, not so much. The mercurial activist has gone out of his way to impugn the film, calling it a failed project based on “discredited and “toxic” books that give a “falsified” version of WikiLeaks. “The result is a reactionary snoozefest that only the U.S. government could love,” he told the New York Times. (The movie is based on the books Inside WikiLeaks by Daniel Domscheit-Berg and WikiLeaks by David Leigh and Luke Harding.) Earlier reviews describe the Assange character as “obsessed and arrogant, committed and charismatic.”
No friend of the State Department, the 2010 Cablegate disclosures hit Foggy Bottom harder than any other U.S. department. The total number of disclosed files amounted to an unprecedented 251,287 documents, seven times larger than the size of the world's previously the largest classified release, “The Iraq War Logs.”
Now Assange will have to cope with the fact that America's diplomats — many of whom were reassigned or negatively impacted by the disclosures — will be watching Cumberbatch's depiction on the big screen. Enjoy the show.
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- First came the iPhone. Then, there was the "iFart" flatulence noise download. Now, there's "Pull My Finger" -- and next could come the lawsuits.
A Florida-based company has accused a Colorado competitor in federal court of trademark infringement and unfair business practices over the phrase "Pull My Finger."
The dispute began after the makers of iFart began using phrase "pull my finger" in advertisements for their products.
Air-o-Matic, based in Jacksonville, Florida, and Colorado-based InfoMedia, Inc., both offer a range of competing software applications, or "apps," that subscribers can download into their multitasking cell phones. Users can make calls, listen to music, browse the Internet and play games on the devices.
Individual "apps" cost a dollar and up, and can be used to get directions, read restaurant reviews and make funny noises. Enter the flatulence sound app, which both companies offer to customers.
Air-o-Matic says its app, "Pull My Finger" has a unique brand identity that its competitor has infringed. It wants $50,000 from Infomedia to settle the dispute and may sue in federal court.
In a formal complaint filed in a Denver, Colorado, federal court, however, InfoMedia says the phrase is a common "descriptive" term used in its advertising and cannot be trademarked.
The company wants a judge to step in now, before any lawsuit is filed, and allow it to continue to use the phrase.
According to InfoMedia's legal filing, its iFart app "boasts a number of unique features including a built-in security system designed to aurally surprise and discourage iPhone theft. iFart also features a "Sneak Attack" function using a timer that emits the sound of flatulence when it goes off, the company says, and can also be used as a prank to an unsuspecting person.
Joel Conn, founder of Infomedia, said on his own blog that his app is a "cultural phenomenon."
The company claims there are about 75 different flatulence simulation software applications.
There was no word on when a judge might rule on the complaint.

Shocking video has emerged of a massive brawl between diners at an IHOP in Austin, Texas.
A group of men and women all seem to be sitting around and enjoying their meal, but then a few customers start yelling at each other.
Onlookers took out their phones to take videos or photos when three or four women started throwing punches and beating each other, all while yelling and repeatedly calling one another 'b****'.
A group of men and women all seem to be sitting around and enjoying their meal when a few members of the group start yelling at each other
LaRon Perkins seemed to find the encounter hilarious, and posted the video on Facebook, saying: 'It went down in Austin IHOP last night !! Bihh got to throwin plates from our table & all our s*** was free.'
It's not clear why they started fighting, but footage shows friends trying to keep the women apart.
However, they continually escape their friends grips to launch themselves at each other.
At one point, footage shows that two of the women have a third, who is wearing a tight red dress, in a headlock.
When she escapes she goes over to one of the tables and grabs a plate of food and chucks them across the restaurant.
One of the women can also be heard saying 'this is my city b****'.
The fighting slows down at multiple times throughout the video, only to pick back up when the women are able to break free and start again.

HITC Sport understands West Ham United and Crystal Palace are among those considering a move for Lee Angol, with Nottingham Forest set to miss out.
Luton Town starlet Lee Angol has rejected a new contract at Kenilworth Road and is set to leave the club without playing a game, with Premier League and Championship clubs ready to pounce, HITC Sport understands from sources close to the player.
The 20-year-old was snapped up by the Hatters last summer when he was released by Wycombe Wanderers, and they sent him straight on-loan to Conference South Side Boreham Wood.
And Angol enjoyed a wonderful campaign, claiming 25 goals in 39 games and helping them to promotion into the Conference
Luton are now desperate for Angol to sign a new deal, with his current contract due to expire this summer, but HITC understand that he has shunned the offer, with a host of clubs waiting in the wings.
Nottingham Forest were looking to land the player but, because of transfer restrictions due to Financial Fair Play breaches, they could only offer an incentive-based deal to Luton – who are due compensation should Angol leave.
But HITC understands that interest is growing elsewhere. West Ham United, Crystal Palace, Bournemouth, Brentford, Charlton Athletic and Milton Keynes Dons are all now ready to make a move for the highly-rated youngster.
Gopher It
"Gopher It" was the 19th and final episode of the fourth season of Corner Gas, and the 69th in its history. It first aired on CTV on March 12, 2007. Some promotion for the show, particularly a TV spot set to Blue Rodeo's 1994 hit, "Bad Timing," as well as a press release from CTV, had some fans wondering if the series was coming to an unexpected end. The matter was soon cleared up by CTV.
Synopsis: With the mayoral election approaching, Fitzy wants the citizens of Dog River to come up with ways to bring more tourism to town. Surprisingly, Hank has the best idea of all, but it soon changes everyone's lives, some for the better, and others for the worse.
For their performances in this episode, Brent Butt, Lorne Cardinal, Fred Ewanuick, Gabrielle Miller, Eric Peterson, Nancy Robertson, Tara Spencer-Nairn and Janet Wright won the Gemini Award for Best Ensemble Performance in a Comedy Program or Series on October 28, 2007. It was the cast's first win on its fourth nomination for the honor. Mark Farrell's script also earned him the Gemini for Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Program or Series. Ratings-wise, the episode drew 2 million viewers, the highest ratings of the season, the highest-rated season finale ever, and the second-highest-rated episode in Corner Gas' history.
Just past the midway point of the episode, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper makes a cameo appearance, just as his predecessor, Paul Martin, did in Season Three's "Fun Run."

Officials in Afghanistan's eastern Nangarar province say the Islamic State group is trying to imprint a lasting legacy on children in the region through an increasing network of religious seminaries and schools.
Authorities say IS runs at least 25 seminaries in four districts of the province where children are taught military ideology and how to prepare for suicide attacks.
Madrassas, or Muslim seminaries, "that were built by local people are now being used by IS for militant activities,” Abdul Zahir Haqqani, director of religious affairs in Nangarhar, told VOA's Afghan service. "They use them as military centers where they teach militancy, conduct military trainings and plan their activities."
Children of IS fighters make up the majority of pupils, but some local children also attend the IS-run schools, officials say.
Residents say they are alarmed by IS' expertise in teaching terror to children and are asking for local and government intervention.
"The madrassas in the areas remain under IS' control where it trains its fighters,” Ezzatullah, a local resident in the Dehbala district, told VOA.
“They used to be under the government but not anymore,” said Ezzatullah, who, like many Afghans, uses a single name. “They teach how to shoot a Kalashnikov, a PK machine gun and RPG" or rocket-propelled grenade.
Provincial leaders say they are preparing an assault to rid IS from the schools.
"IS and other militant groups always try to use Islamic centers as their bases where they not only provide training, but also use them for other terror activities," provincial government spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told VOA's Afghan service.
“We will continue our efforts to clear the Islamic centers of IS presence without causing damage to the centers,” he said.
IS launched its operation in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region in early 2015 after establishing bases in remote eastern border areas of Afghanistan. The group calls Afghanistan, Pakistan and parts of Iran its so-called Islamic State of Khorasan province, and allegedly takes orders from leaders in Syria.
In Nangarhar, the fight against IS has at times involved a varied combination of local militias, provincial police, Afghan forces, Taliban fighters and U.S. drone strikes.
IS is also using mosques as military centers. According to Haqqani, the group has turned at least 60 mosques in various districts of Nangarhar into military training centers. Dozens of mosque imams, whom IS deemed as repugnant to its extremist ideology, have been killed by IS militants.
Experts say IS indoctrination of children will likely have a chilling reverberation for years to come, especially in a country long hit by extremism and militancy.
“The only thing worse than a society falling prey to the extremist ideologies of terror is when society's children succumbs to the same thing,” said Michael Kugelman, a South Asia specialist at the Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington think tank. "And that's precisely what we have to worry about here amid this news."
Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) has been hospitalized in Detroit and a consultant who works with the lawmaker said it is because of stress caused by alleged “media assault” following multiple women saying that he sexually harassed them.
ClickOnDetroit reported that Conyers' office confirmed the hospitalization but did not give the name of the hospital or the reason he was admitted.
But a consultant for Conyers told reporters it is related to the sex scandal.
“I just spoke with Monica Conyers on the phone and we want you to know that the congressman is resting comfortably in an area hospital. He's doing OK, as well as he can be expected for a gentleman that's approaching 90 years of age,” Sam Riddle said in the ClickOnDetroit article.
“The congressman's health is not what it should be and a lot of that is directly attributable to this media assault,” Riddle said.
Despite the charges by multiple women — which Conyers denies — an attorney for the 88-year-old lawmaker said he does not plan to resign his seat.
Conyers' attorney, Arnold Reed, told CNN on Wednesday. “If everybody that was facing ‘allegations' — including the president, members of the House and Senate — resigned, we'd have a lot of unemployed people walking around.”
On Sunday, Conyers announced he was stepping down from his ranking member position on the House Judiciary Committee.
“After careful consideration and in light of the attention drawn by recent allegations made against me, I have notified the Democratic Leader of my request to step aside as ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee during the investigation of these matters,” Conyers said.

As I write this, I'm coming off the back of a 10 match online winless streak on FIFA 14 so excuse me if it comes across like I'm a sore loser. Admittedly, I am a sore loser but stay with me.
FIFA is the undisputed champ of football games now that Pro Evo has become about appealing as watching Dagenham and Redbridge on a Sunday. However, that doesn't stop EA Sports from consistently putting out an infuriatingly patchy new edition each year that we still all snap up nonetheless.
There's always a sense of one step forward, two steps back when it comes to FIFA. It can have all the fancy polishes and gimmicks in the world yet still have core problems year-on-year. With that in mind, here are 7 things we need to see addressed for the impending FIFA 15 in September. I'd still buy it even if Emile Heskey was lead developer to be fair.
1. Calm down the headers
Trying to play pure football online is hard when the opponent can simply spread it down the wing, dribble to the touchline and send a cross in that will result in a goal all too often.
Even from the most unlikely of angles, a winger will deliver a pinpoint cross. As well as being wildly unrealistic, most strikers will be able to convert no matter their size. Messi outleaping Kompany to smash a ball in shouldn't happen but it sure does in FIFA. Fix it.
2. Less glitchy touches
Ever since FIFA introduced new engines for realistic ball control, the ironic thing is that some touches can be anything but controlled and will regularly ping off into the outer stratosphere.
When you've just defended a dangerous attack only for the ball to roll out of your feet and into the path of the opposition, it often results in swear words and lobbed controllers. It's as if EA have been basing their motion capture on Titus Bramble.
3. Take away the effectiveness of lob passes
Eurgh. This is the worst thing. You don't often see lob passes come off in a real football match but in FIFA 14, you can easily find your way to goal with just a few flicks. No matter how good you are, you'll come unstuck thanks to this technique on an infuriatingly regular basis.
It needs to be addressed; online matches are often decided thanks to a lob pass and it cheapens the whole experience.
4. New commentator and commentary
Nothing against you, Alan Smith, but I'm pretty sick of hearing you talk.
Replacing Andy ‘Champ Kind' Gray was always going to be a tricky task and it was a bizarre pick to choose someone who isn't even the best at Sky Sports. Two years later and with largely the same Alan Smith commentary from 13 to 14, it's time for a change. Chris Kamara, your time has come.
5. Focus on game modes that aren't Ultimate Team
I do not get the appeal behind Ultimate Team. Not even a little. So it's quite a shame to see that EA Sports are spending so much time on building this up rather than Career.
Build on the other modes that the more casual gamer might enjoy and fix the many bugs and fixes that surround them and EA will help me to stop placing hexes on their mortal souls.
6. Champions League
EVERTON HAVE JUST WON THE CHAMPIONS CUP. Doesn't sound quite as good, right?
It seems so odd that a franchise like FIFA has never been able to snare the rights to the UEFA Champions League beyond awkward standalone games that only the most ardent of fans will have snapped up. The fact that only PES have the rights to the most illustrious of club competitions is a bit of a disservice to FIFA's fans and at the very least, we should be getting Europa League. At the VERY least.

Kim Jong-un enjoys an approval rating among North Korean voters of more than 50%, the latest poll shows. That's close to Shinzo Abe territory, easily above Barack Obama's 45%.
Well, sort of. Polling hasn't yet caught on in North Korea. As for voting, it seems likely that any election involving Mr. Kim would end with his being declared winner “by the unanimous will and desire of the Korean people,” in the style of his father, Kim Jong Il. But the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University interviewed 133 North Koreans who fled the country from January 2012 to May 2013, and asked them to estimate Mr. Kim's approval rating while they were in the country; 62% of the former North Koreans put it at more than 50%.

The 1 GW Wandoan South Solar Projects will deliver a massive energy and employment boost to the region.
Equis Energy has secured approval to begin constructing one of the largest solar farms in the world – a 1 GW installation in the Australian state of Queensland.
The Western Downs Regional Council has approved the plans submitted by Singapore-based renewable energy developer Equis Energy to build the AU$1.5 billion to $2 billion project.
Equis Energy chairman David Russell confirmed to pv magazine on Friday that the developer had been given the greenlight to build the Wandoan South Solar Projects (WSSP), stating: “The project will not only provide significant amounts of low-cost clean energy, but will also generate new jobs and training opportunities, with millions of dollars invested throughout local communities.
“The WSSP will have the ability to add battery storage when commercially feasible. This will allow energy to be stored and facilitate the generation of power into the evening,” added Russell.
The project is expected to generate up to 400 jobs during the construction phase, according to local Mayor Paul McVeigh.
Speaking to the Toowoomba Chronicle this morning on the occasion of the approval, McVeigh said: “It's a AU$2 billion construction cost and of that we expect at least 50% of that to be invested in the local community.
“This 1,000 MW farm is definitely the largest in Australia that is approved at this stage, and potentially one of the largest in the world. It covers a lot of country. The ones we have approved to date have been up to 250 MW.”
The chosen site is a 1,424 hectare stretch of land 12 km southwest of the town of Wandoan, in a region of the country blessed with some of Australia's highest levels of solar irradiation.
Solar energy is an increasingly viable and attractive source of power across Australia – a fact not lost on the mayor. “We have our coal and coal-fired power stations and coal seam gas,” McVeigh said. “Now we have a third wave of energy with solar farms about to start construction. We are proud to be making ourselves the energy capital of Queensland and, we hope, for Australia.”
Queensland' government has recently revealed plans to deliver a reverse auction for 400 MW of renewable energy capacity in the state as it seeks to bolster its clean power mix with a AU$1.16 billion investment drive.
The state currently has around 700 MW of large-scale solar capacity installed – a figure dwarfed by the 1.7 GW of rooftop PV in place across Queensland. However, some 1.2 GW of utility-scale projects have already begun development, and the addition of Equis Energy's 1 GW plant will significantly bolster the state's solar footprint.
In February, Equis Energy invested AU$400 million into two, 100 MWac solar PV projects – one located in South Australia and the other in Queensland.
Often, you will wish to create cards out of sentences that express several facts, such as the following:
The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which is located in the North Island and has a population of about 400,000.
There is more than one fact in this statement – you could create a single 'simple' card with all the facts marked as cloze text, like so:
The capital city of [New Zealand] is [Wellington], which is located in the [North||North/South] Island and has a population of about [400,000].
But this card will be difficult to remember. If you get just one of the 4 hidden facts wrong, you will fail the card. A card like this is likely to become a leech.
A better way to express all these facts using 'simple' cards is to create several cards, with one fact per card. You might end up with something like this:
* Fact The capital city of [New Zealand] is Wellington, which has a population of about 400,000. * Fact The capital city of New Zealand is [Wellington], which has a population of about 400,000. * Fact The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which has a population of about [400,000]. * Fact The capital city of [New Zealand] is Wellington, which is located in the the North Island. * Fact The capital city of New Zealand is [Wellington], which is located in the North Island. * Fact The capital city of New Zealand is Wellington, which is located in the [North||North/South] Island.
However, this is really cumbersome. Multicloze card types exist for this situation. Multicloze cards behave like 'simple' cards, except that when there is more than one area marked as cloze text, some but not all of the areas can be hidden. There are several types of predefined multicloze card:
hide1cloze – one of the marked areas is hidden during review; the others all remain visible. The hidden text area is chosen randomly at each review. (Note: this type used to be called 'multicloze', and that card type is retained as a synonym for 'hide1cloze'.) show1cloze – only one of the marked areas is visible during review; all the others are hidden. The hidden text area is chosen randomly at each review. hide2cloze – like hide1cloze, but 2 marked pieces of text will be hidden, and the rest will be visible. show2cloze – like show1cloze, but 2 marked pieces of text will be visible, the rest are hidden.
There are also some types of multicloze card where some pieces have an increased or decreased chance of being hidden. These are intended for use when studying languages: generally it is easy to translate a foreign-language sentence into your own language if you have met it before, but it is much harder to translate in the other direction. Therefore, you will want to test the harder direction more often.
hide1_firstmore – only one of the marked pieces of text will be hidden. 75% of the time (guaranteed), the first piece is hidden; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly hidden. show1_firstless – only one of the marked pieces of text will be visible. Only 25% of the time (guaranteed) will the first piece will be visible; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly visible. show1_lastmore – only one of the marked pieces of text will be visible. 75% of the time (guaranteed), the last piece will be visible; the rest of the time, one of the other pieces is randomly visible.
So, for the above example, we can actually use the original 'bad' simple card, but change its card type to 'hide1cloze'. Each time the card is presented for review, one of 'New Zealand', 'Wellington', 'the South Island' or '400,000' will be hidden.
* Fact :PROPERTIES: :DRILL_CARD_TYPE: hide1cloze :END: The capital city of [New Zealand] is [Wellington], which is located in the [North||North/South] Island and has a population of about [400,000].
HEBRON (Ma'an) -- Israeli forces on Friday detained a director for the Independent Commission for Human Rights during a peaceful protest marking the 22nd anniversary of the Ibrahimi mosque massacre.
The ICHR said in a statement that Israeli forces assaulted then detained Farid al-Atrash, a lawyer, in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.
The organization called the violence used against al-Atrash "a crime," and said it was following up on the matter with lawyers and the Palestinian military liaison office in Hebron.
Al-Atrash was participating in a protest commemorating the 22 years since extremist American-born Baruch Goldstein opened fire on Muslim worshipers killing 29 and injuring more than 120 in the Ibrahimi mosque in 1994.
The demonstration also called for the re-opening of al-Shuhada street, which was shut down soon after the massacre.
Amnesty International earlier this week slammed Israel for maintaining “severe and discriminatory restrictions on movement” that were imposed on Palestinian residents of Hebron after the massacre, while allowing Israeli settlers free access.
Increased military presence has spread across the Hebron district since October, with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reporting higher restrictions in the district than any other area across the occupied Palestinian territory.
Israeli military checkpoints were set up at the entrances to many Hebron-district villages, and residents reported harassment, arbitrary detentions, an increase in traffic, and curfews.
Areas of Hebron's Old City -- where the Ibrahimi mosque and al-Shuhada street are located -- have come under intensive military presence in particular, declared a “closed military zone” since November.
Doing something the wrong way can easily become second nature if you practice long enough. Start typing with two fingers, or make a habit of lifting from your back, or routinely brush your teeth from side-to-side (or is it up-and-down?) and eventually you'll become a sort of slow-typing, tartar-plagued hunchback stuck in a dentist's chair, forced to listen to the hygienist's annual lecture about proper brushing technique. Indeed, if you give it adequate time, you can easily become proficient at the most inefficient of endeavours.
If I didn't know better, I'd think that was the theory behind Ontario's $60 million “renewed math strategy,” which will require all elementary school students to have at least one hour of math instruction per day. The way students are taught math in Grade 1 through Grade 8 won't change — indeed, it will still be of the relatively new, convoluted “discovery math” methods, over which students, parents and many teachers have been pulling their hair out for the last number of years. The only difference is that students will now be devoting more time to this hard-to-grasp, overly complicated way of learning math, all while the old, effective learn-by-rote curriculum is left to gather dust in a broom closet somewhere at the Ministry of Education. Oh, and by the way, children: remember to lift with your backs.
Discovery math, which is also called “inquiry based math,” focuses on problem-solving, estimation and real-world applications rather than “math facts” and memorization. Under the old curriculum, students relied on memory to solve simple multiplication questions — a technique that allowed them to summon figures instantly when later moving on to more complicated equations. But now, each mathematical process is broken down, digested and re-digested with the intention of promoting greater understanding. In practice, however, it tends to just breed unnecessary confusion.
In a C.D. Howe Institute report from last year, University of Winnipeg professor Anna Stokke offered a good example of the tortuousness that is discovery math: “Students are often encouraged to work out number facts such as 7×8 using doubling,” she wrote. “8 is the double of 4 and 7×4 =28, so 7×8 = 28 + 28 = 56.” Everyone got that? This method could also be described as “How to make your nine-year old rip up her homework and leave the kitchen table in tears.”
If there were early hopes that discovery math would improve students' grasp of the fundamentals, they have since been dashed by steadily declining test scores — both within Ontario and in provinces such as Manitoba and Alberta, which also adopted discovery math programs. In the 2013/2014 school year, for example, just 67 per cent of Grade 3 students scored at or above the provincial standard in the EQAO math test, down four percentage points from 2009/2010. Grade 6 students are doing worse, with only 54 per cent scoring at or above the provincial average in 2013/2014, down seven percentage points from 2009/2010. These trends made a whole lot of sense, considering the situation: if a student is left counting her fingers and toes to figure out 7 x 8 in Grade 3, there's no way she'll be able to multiply fractions in Grade 6.
[np_storybar title=”Read & Debate” link=””]
[/np_storybar]
The Ontario government seems to believe that more time for math could be the answer, though many provincial school boards already require five hours or more of math instruction per week. Education Minister Liz Sandals also announced Monday that every school will soon see at least one “math lead teacher” who is “deeply knowledgeable about teaching math,” though she stopped short of saying that all teachers will be required to be deeply knowledgeable about teaching math, or even that teachers will have been required to take a math class since they themselves were in Grade 11. No, the solution here is to double down and devote more time to a flawed, ineffective, needlessly complex math program. Practice makes perfect, kids.

Malawi: fundamentalist clergymen urge government to keep criminalising homosexuality
“We are imploring the Malawian government to maintain its stand on homosexuality - that it is criminal.” It was a Reverend Dr Zac Kawalala of Word Alive Church who said these words, just a few days after the government had asked for financial support to expand treatment and prevention for HIV for various groups, including men who have sex with men. "A big concern on our part is financing a section of our society involved in divine behaviour (sic.), which is a sin according to the Scriptures,” said fundamentalist Kawalala.
Similar statements, AllAfrica points out, were also recently delivered by other extreme right clergymen. During a religious convention in Blantyre, a conservative bishop reportedly asked the government not to compromise the country's “cultural, biblical and moral values,” while another compared equality to opening "the floodgates of evil.”
Greece: civil partnership bill published for public debate
The Greek ministry of Justice published its legislative initiative for civil partnerships in the country: a public consultation on the issue is currently taking place, and will last until next Friday. The initiative was announced during the ILGA Europe regional conference, but the bill was made available online only on Monday. The document points out that partnerships may be entered by two adults irrespective of gender and comes into effect when submitted to the local civil register.

United States: White House supports bill to ban LGBTI discrimination
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIfr1ZSvGJg
The White House publicly supported legislation that would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
“That bill is historic legislation that would advance the cause of equality for millions of Americans,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
The endorsement came on the same day that Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to be featured on the cover of an LGBTI publication, after he was named Out magazine's “Ally of the Year” for 2015.
However, as The Washington Post makes clear, there is little chance the Equality Act will become law before Obama leaves office, with Republicans now in control of both chambers of Congress.
Fiji: trans woman sees her legal gender recognition request denied
The High Court in Fiji rejected the request of a 42-year-old trans woman who was looking to have her gender recognised on official documents. The woman, now a New Zealand citizen, had sought for her Fijian birth certificate to be corrected, but the Suva High Court ruled otherwise, saying that sex reassignment after birth is not an “error” in a birth certificate and that it did not even recognize the existence of gender transition, declaring the situation akin to somebody who had plastic surgery to artificially create sex organs.
According to local media, which misgendered the woman, the court said also that ‘by a male to female transsexual surgery, all what the doctors can do is to artificially create certain female organs in a male's body, but that person does not become a female for all intents and purposes.' The court ruling was defined “disappointing” by local trans organisations.

Costa Rica: lesbian couple get married, now may risk prosecution
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TheQtEKBto
A lesbian couple got married in Costa Rica, and now they might face prosecution. Same-sex marriages are not recognized in the country, where the penal code punishes people who knowingly violate the law with a jail sentence of up to six years. The couple managed to get married thanks to a clerical error in the birth certificate of one of them, which actually lists her sex as male.
“I legally married a man and a woman,” the lawyer who notarized their marriage contract, reportedly said. He could face prosecution along with the two women, too. After news of the marriage broke, Costa Rica's Civil Registry issued a new birth certificate for the bride, nullified the union, and referred the case to prosecutors.

India: “Who are we to treat trans people unjustly?”, says prime minister
Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said the government needs to “change its outlook” on trans people, in what is believed to be his first public address on the topic. “Who are we to treat them unjustly?” he said during a Legal Services Day. “We will have to bring changes to the legal system, amend the rules”.
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that trans people be recognized as a third gender and enjoy all fundamental rights. This July, Human Rights Watch asked the Indian parliament to enact a bill on the rights of Transgender persons, which would allow for legal gender recognition and ensure better legal protections for the country's trans population.

UPDATE: On Monday, December 18, 2017, the Bell V-280 tilt-rotor took to the sky under its own power for the first time, marking the milestone of first flight. The aircraft lifted off the ground at 2 pm local time and hovered for around 20 minutes. Officials say the V-280 did everything they wanted it to on this initial flight, and now they can start the long and rigorous flight testing program. This story about the development of the aircraft originally ran on Thursday, October 5, 2017.
On a gray concrete ramp lined by neon yellow safety rails, a mean-looking military machine spins up. The twin propeller blades whirl, but the beast isn't going anywhere. It's bolted down, attached to load sensors that measure and quantify its attempt to escape.
Even without takeoff, the movement of those propellers marks a milestone for a new kind of aircraft, the technological successor to the famed V-22 Osprey and a leading candidate to replace the US Army's aging workhorse, the Black Hawk helicopter.
On that concrete ramp, the V-280 Valor tiltrotor started its engines for its first ground tests, with engineers monitoring every possible parameter to be sure each system in this one-of-a-kind prototype is working properly. When fully operational, the V-280 Valor should offer double the speed and range of the conventional helicopters it's aiming to make redundant.
"Wow, it's a real aircraft,” I blurt out as I pass through a small door, into the towering, brightly lit, V-280 assembly hangar at Bell Helicopter in Amarillo, Texas. The look of a tilt-rotor aircraft is so alien, it's easy to forget this isn't something dreamt up by the Battlestar Galactica prop department.
Bell Helicopter
“It is a real aircraft,” agrees Shannon Massey, Bell's VP of assembly operations, with a smile. It's a reaction she's used to. The V-280 is truly something different. It's smaller, simpler, and cheaper than the massively complex V-22, which dates to the late '80s. Bell designed and built the V-280 from scratch, always with an eye on making it easy to assemble and maintain, with lessons learned from building the V-22, a joint project with Boeing.
As I duck under the wing and walk up to the cockpit, I'm struck by the expanse of glass. The V-280's pilots will get a wrap-around view of the sky—or battlefield—around them. They'll also have a comfy flight. The flight control avionics come from Lockheed Martin's C-130K plane setup, with large, flat, screens built into the dash. With the speed and range that Bell is claiming for this thing, pilot fatigue could become an issue, so designers replaced a conventional central cyclic control (the stick between a helicopter pilot's legs) with a joystick that falls under the pilot's right hand.
Bell Helicopter
As a tiltrotor, the V-280 is a hybrid between a plane and a helicopter. Instead of one central rotor, it has two, mounted at the end of two stubby wings. For takeoff and landing, the blades are parallel to the ground, so the machine can get airborne without a runway and hover. Once in the air, the rotors swivel forward, the way a plane's propellers sit, to allow high speed forward flight. The V-22 may have proven the concept, but also showed how complicated and expensive a transforming machine can be.
Bell simplified the V-280 with a setup that swings the propellers but keeps the engines stationary. That takes out a bunch of moving parts, avoids scorching the ground during takeoff and landing, and allows for a side-loading door, which the Army likes.
Back a few yards from the prototype, beyond the yellow rope, sits a row of tall metal workstations. “We've gone old-school in some ways and pulled people out of offices,” says Jeff Josselyn, manager of the V-280 build team. He says it makes communication easier, and keeps everyone focused on the goal. “I don't care what kind of day you're having, when you look up and see that beautiful aircraft, it just makes you want to keep leaning into the wind.”
These ground tests are a long-awaited achievement for Josselyn and his team. They started engineering work on the aircraft in 2012, and began building the thing in June 2015. But true success will take yet more work. There's more testing, yes, but the main trick will be convincing the US Army to actually buy the thing. Bell built the V-280 to compete for the Pentagon's joint multirole technology demonstrator program. It faces competition from Boeing and Sikorsky, which are jointly building the SB-1 Defiant, a high speed helicopter.
Observers like Bell's chances. “This could be a great leap forward for Army aviation,” says Jerry Kidrick, a retired Army colonel who flew helicopters in Iraq and now teaches aviation and flight training at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. One day, tiltrotors could filter down to civilian transport, eliminating runways. The technological and materials advances that made this aircraft possible could also benefit the designers of flying cars, which promise similar vertical takeoff abilities.
Bell is confident that the advantages of a new type of flying machine outweigh the risks. The next step in proving its point should come by the end of the year, when Bell unhooks the V-280 for the first flight.
Authorities seized computers and servers in the United States and seven other countries this week as part of an ongoing investigation of a hacking gang that stole $72 million by tricking people into buying fake anti-virus products. Police in Ukraine said the thieves fleeced unsuspecting consumers with the help of the infamous Conficker worm, although it remains unclear how big a role the fast-spreading worm played in this crime.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said today that it had seized at least 74 pieces of computer equipment and cash from a criminal group suspected of running a massive operation to steal banking information from consumers with the help of Conficker and scareware, a scam that uses misleading security alerts to frighten people into paying for worthless security software. A Google-translated version of an SBU press release suggests that the crime gang used Conficker to deploy the scareware, and then used the scareware to launch a virus that stole victims' financial information.
The Ukrainian action appears to be related to an ongoing international law enforcement effort dubbed Operation Trident Tribunal by the FBI. In a statement released Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had seized 22 computers and servers in the United States that were involved in the scareware scheme. The Justice Department said 25 additional computers and servers located abroad were taken down as part of the operation, in cooperation with authorities in the Netherlands, Latvia, Germany, France, Lithuania, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that dozens of Web sites were knocked offline when FBI officials raided a data center in Reston, Va. and seized Web servers. Officials from an affected hosting company told the Times that they didn't know the reason for the raid, but the story suggested it may have been related to an ongoing investigation into a string of brazen intrusions by the hacktivist group “Lulzsec.” Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that the raid was instead related to the scareware investigation.
The FBI's statement confirms the SBU's estimate of $72 million losses, estimating that the scam claimed at least 960,000 victims. Although the FBI made no mention of Conficker in any of its press materials, the Ukrainian SBU's press release names and quotes Special Agent Norman Sanders from the FBI's Seattle field office, broadly known in the security industry as the agency's lead in the Conficker investigation. Conficker first surfaced in November 2008. The SBU said the FBI has been investigating the case for three years. [Update, June 24, 9:37 a.m.: Not sure whether this was an oversight or a deliberate attempt to deceive, but the picture showing the stack of PCs confiscated in this raid is identical to the one shown in an SBU press release last fall, when the Ukrainian police detained five individuals connected to high-profile ZeuS Trojan attacks.]
“Exchanging information with the Security Service, it became clear that the intelligence services of both countries [were] investigating criminal acts of the same persons,” the SBU said in its prepared statement.
There are no court records of this case publicly available in the United States; a spokesperson at the Justice Department office in the Western District of Washington said the documents remain sealed. She referred questions about the case to the FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. When asked specifically about the Conficker connection, FBI spokeswoman Jenny Shearer would say only that “there are indications that one of the delivery mechanisms for the scareware in this investigation was a Conficker variant.”
The Conficker element of this case is interesting for several reasons: The worm was so sophisticated and spread so quickly that it prompted unprecedented cooperation among governments and security experts, who formed the Conficker Working Group to help contain the damage wrought by the worm. Conficker certainly wrought financial damage — it is estimated to have infected more than 12 million PCs — but until today there has been little information to suggest that this massive crime machine was used to generate profits for cyber crooks.
I know of two previous instances in which Conficker was linked to scareware scams. The first involved the initial version of the worm, which instructed all infected PCs to visit and download a file from TrafficConverter.biz, the domain of an affiliate program that paid hackers to distribute its brand of scareware. As I reported in a March 2009 story in The Washington Post, the top affiliates for that program were making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month pushing scareware, although it is not clear whether Conficker-infected systems ever received any scareware downloads from the domain. From that story:
“By the time Conficker first surfaced, TrafficConverter was nearing the end of a contest in which the top-selling affiliates competed for prizes, such as computers, fancy cell phones and other electronics. The grand prize? A Lexus IS250, a sports sedan that starts at $36,000. At first glance, it is tempting to assume that the Conficker worm authors were in league with the operators of TrafficConverter.biz, and thus trying to drive traffic to the site — perhaps in an attempt to push the contest in favor of one or more affiliates. On the other hand, this may have been an attempt by the Conficker authors or a competing affiliate program to hinder and ultimately shutter TrafficConverter.biz, either by causing law enforcement and the security community to focus their attention on it, or by flooding the site with traffic from hundreds of thousands of Conficker-infected systems.” And flood the site it did. According to [SecureWorks's Joe] Stewart's review of the traffic log files for TrafficConverter.biz, during a 12-hour period on Nov. 24, the site was bombarded by more than 83 million hits from at least 179,000 unique Internet addresses. The traffic from Conficker.A infected system to TrafficConverter.biz might have translated into monster installs for affiliates of the site. Ironically, all of that traffic from Conficker-infected systems appears to have gone to a non-existent page on TrafficConverter.biz, Stewart said. In short, the site missed a pretty huge opportunity to convert a whole lot of traffic. Still, had the curators of TrafficConverter.biz actually placed a file at that link for download, the resulting traffic from 179,000 systems trying to download that file at the same time probably would have crashed the site entirely, Stewart said.”
Conficker's second association with scareware came three weeks after that story. On April 8, 2009, Kaspersky Lab reported that it had seen some Conficker infected systems updated with a scareware product called Spyware Protect 2009. Kaspersky analysts also discovered that infected PCs were seeded with another update: a version of the Waledac worm, which is able to steal data and send spam.
Anyone with information about the identity of the Conficker author(s) could have a lucrative tip on their hands: Microsoft has an outstanding $250,000 bounty for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for launching the worm.

Liverpool intends to hold further talks with Emre Can's representatives at the end of the season in a bid to end his contract stand-off.
The Germany international's future is uncertain as he prepares to enter the final year of his existing deal.
However, Jurgen Klopp wants to Can to stay put and the manager is hoping that a compromise can be reached to extend his stay at Anfield.
Negotiations conducted by Liverpool sporting director Michael Edwards over an extension broke down before Christmas and the ECHO understands they have yet to resume. Can's representatives had been seeking around £100,000 per week for a player who currently earns around half that amount.
The 23-year-old midfielder has yet to convince Liverpool that he's worth that kind of figure and all parties have agreed to put discussions on the backburner for the time being.
Can have struggled for consistency so far this term but he produced one of his best performances of the campaign in last weekend's victory over Arsenal.
With captain Jordan Henderson still hampered by a foot problem, Can is likely to retain his place for Sunday's Premier League clash with Burnley.
A strong end to the season as Liverpool chase a Champions League spot would certainly strengthen Can's hand ahead of the resumption of discussions.
Asked recently if the £10million signing from Bayer Leverkusen in 2014 remained part of his long-term plans, Klopp said: “I speak to the players, not the press.
“If I say yes it puts pressure on the club to do it immediately. If I say no the player thinks I do not want him any more.
“Emre knows exactly what we want. That's the only thing that matters.”
If Can don't sign a new deal this summer Liverpool would have to listen to offers for him but the former Bayern Munich trainee could opt to remain at Anfield and run down his contract.
Speaking to the ECHO back in November, Can say: “It is my agent's work (to sort it out). I am very happy here at Liverpool.”
Can share the same agent as Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Mahmoud Dahoud, who was a target for Liverpool last summer but is no longer on their wish-list.
On the morning of May 3rd, 2011, I was walking to the bus stop on my way to work -a co-op position in the public sector, where most of the Ottawa-based positions were. It was dead silent until a school bus went by, and a young boy yelled gleefully out the window, “Harper won majority!” It echoed, and the effect was almost comically ominous.
The effects of this conservative electoral victory were felt immediately. I saw my coworkers, gravely silent and saying they didn't get much sleep that night. I saw the effects of the hiring freeze –friends, co-workers, none of them able to move up from the student positions they occupied. Hundreds of people in my parents' friend circles and mine getting letters informing them their jobs were at risk, stewing in anxiety for months until they were either let go or given the all clear. I heard of a single mother whose job was cut because she was seen as a liability. I saw people retire a few years early, rather than face a severance package.
But the yearly contribution threshold was raised for my Tax-Free Savings Account, so BONUS!
This is why I can't trust our prime minister when he speaks about the economy. That and the fact that Canada has had $150 billion in national debt, and the Harper Government has run at least six deficits. In fact, Canada is close to a recession. One needs only to look at the trends in federal deficits/surpluses under the last few Canadian prime ministers to see that the conservatives' campaign ads that promise economicsecurity are just another “brutally simple” and manipulative campaign tactic.
Another example of Harper's saying one thing and doing another is Motion 312. While promising in previous campaigns that a woman's right to choose would remain enshrined in Canadian law, in 2012, Mr Harper allowed one of his backbenchers to put forth Motion 312, which would open a discussion on fetal rights, and look in to expanding/changing the definition of when one could be considered a human being. This motion was struck down, and the discussion was never opened, however, the Minister for the Status of Women, a woman herself, was among those to vote in favour. I repeat: someone in charge of making sure that, among other things, the law protected a woman's right to choose deliberately voted for opening a discussion that could diminish a woman's bodily autonomy.
Recently Mr Harper has attempted to frame his position in favour of banning the Niqab as in the interest of women, calling it a symptom of a culture that is inherently “anti-woman". This was part of the racist campaign tactics that led to the Conservatives' jump in the polls, tactics which saw hesitation to accept (chiefly Muslim) immigrants, the proposal of an RCMP tip line for “Barbaric Cultural Practices” and which indirectly encouraged public abuse of Muslim women in Toronto and Montreal.
If Mr Harper truly wanted to work in the interest of women, he would launch an investigation into the 1181 missing and murdered aboriginal women as per the UN's request, rather than dismissing it as “not high on [his cabinet's] radar”.
Furthermore, any future Canadian government would do well to attend to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as address inequalities between aboriginal communities and the rest of Canada. This includes dealing with the effects of the physical and psychological trauma inflicted by the residential schools of the mid 20th century, and the poor quality of life offered on reserves such as Attawapiskat, whose shameful living conditions led to the Idle No More Movement. Future leaders would do well not to follow in Mr Harper's footsteps and send body bags to reservations hit hard by the H1N1 outbreak and asking for medicine, or visit the Pandas in the Toronto Zoo instead of meeting with the Nishiyuu walkers, six Cree teenagers who had walked 1600 km in order to talk with the PM about issues facing First Nations.
Under the Harper Government, we may have new baby Pandas, but the number of protected waterways has dwindled from millions to a paltry 159. One of Mr Harper's biggest moves once he assumed office was to withdraw Canada from the Kyoto Protocol. Government scientists were then muzzled, told they had to ask the PMO before speaking publicly. David Suzuki has even stepped down from his role at the Suzuki Foundation in order to be able to speak freely. The Canadian economy is now so dependent on oil that it's dangerously close to recession since the price per barrel has gone down.
And amongst all this climate change denial comes Canada's relations with the UN. Canada is no longer on the UN security council, and Canadian representatives have been known to absent themselves from UN discussions on the environment.
And then there is the dishonesty in the Conservatives' election campaigns. In 2006, they sneakily overspent their campaign budget. In 2008, it's possible that Mr Harper broke his own law in order to call an election, simply because he felt the time was favourable in order for him to get a majority government. He failed, though still won a larger minority government. He succeeded following a no confidence motion in 2011 due to lying about how much he spent on F-15 fighter jets and refusing to produce the paperwork. A no confidence motion is about the closest Westminster parliament gets to impeachment, and Harper bounced back with a majority. Was there foul play? Of course. This election saw Harper's Conservatives commit electoral fraud in the form of robocalls, using their electoral database to target liberal ridings, telling voters their polling locations had been changed when they hadn't. This won the Conservatives their majority by very small margins. Though these were reported in 261 of the 308 ridings, only those in Guelph could be substantiated. Still, it was enough to send Conservative staffer, Michael Sona to jail.
And in this campaign, there is the Fair Elections Act, which prevents the Chief Electoral Officer from reminding the public to vote, and no longer allows voter cards to be from as identification. This effectively restricts from voting those who wouldn't likely vote conservative (students, Aboriginals, the elderly), due to the nature of the ID required. There have also been reports of people being removed from the voting register, or re-registered somewhere in Saskatchewan without their knowledge.
Which brings me to the reason I filmed my video in the first place –the expat vote. The five years rule that had been overturned in 2014 was reinstated a few months prior to the election following an appeal by the Harper Government. This states that Canadians living abroad for more than five years can no longer vote, a change which directly affects people like me and our democratic rights.
Voting is a fundamental democratic right guaranteed under Section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. While the five year rule and social contract could conceivably fall under the reasonable limits mentioned in section 1, I ask you: If a citizen who lives abroad wants to vote in the country of their citizenship, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that they are doing so with the best of intentions? Would the country truly suffer from an extra 1.4 million votes?
I don't think the solution is to stop people from voting if they have lived abroad for more than 5 years. All citizens have the right to vote and to participate in the democratic process. What is the point of citizenship if not to vote? If, however, an expat does not feel right about voting in a country they haven't lived in for over 5 years, that person does not have to vote -voting is not mandatory in Canada. The choice should be the individual's.
This continues in the trend of the Harper Government passing legislation that gives some citizens more rights than others. Under Bill C-24, any Canadian who commits an act of terrorism can be stripped of their Canadian citizenship. While obviously problematic in that it allows the state to drop its responsibility for punishment and imprisonment, it also creates two classes of citizens: “old stock” Canadians eligible for no other citizenship, and those whose citizenship is conditional. This law makes second-class citizens of dual citizens, anyone eligible for dual citizenship, and all Canadian Jews no matter how long their families have been in the country, due to Israel's Law of Return.
In 2004, the Liberal Party of Canada ran this campaign ad. It concluded with “Stephen Harper says when he's through with Canada, we won't recognize it.” It is scary how many of these things came true –many of them mentioned above.
The Canada I grew up in prided itself on being a cultural mosaic, and would not turn away as many refugees as it has, or lie about taking more than have actually been granted asylum.The Canada I grew up in sent its military on peacekeeping missions, and stood its ground when the US and UK wanted to join forces in Iraq. The Canada I grew up in did not have a leader who would rebrand the Government of Canada as the Harper Government, and put the Conservative party logo on government cheques. The Canada I grew up in allowed people to vote without so many obstacles, so that due democratic process actually meant something. The Canada I grew up in did not have politicians who promised openness and accountability, yet told journalists they would only answer five questions a day , who muzzled scientists, denied climate change, and sacked people who were just doing their job, like Linda Keen, who reported that the Chalk River nuclear plant was not up to code.
Canada used to be a land of peace and tolerance, a place for everyone, a thriving centre of cultural exchange. Not this country that scapegoats Muslims, feels justified in creating two tiers of citizenship, and brings back practices like exile that went out with the middle ages.
If I don't recognise Canada anymore, does that mean Stephen Harper is done with it? Please let this be a sign, because I've had enough. Haven't you?
China today said a shipment of arms destined for Zimbabwe had been recalled after southern African countries refused to allow the weapons to be unloaded.
The Chinese ship, An Yue Jiang, first ran into trouble in South Africa where dockworkers refused to unload it as a gesture of solidarity with their fellow workers in Zimbabwe.
Other countries followed the example set by South Africa and refused to let the Chinese ship dock. Zambia, which chairs the Southern African Development Community, said the weapons could deepen Zimbabwe's election crisis.
China today said the ship would return home after its fruitless mission.
"This cargo was not unloaded because the Zimbabwe side was unable to take delivery as scheduled. To my knowledge, the Chinese company has decided to recall the ship and the relevant goods bound for Zimbabwe," a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, told a news conference.
But she defended the shipment on the grounds that the contract for the weapons had been signed last year and was unconnected to the current crisis in Zimbabwe.
Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, which has its roots in the union movement, has accused Robert Mugabe's government of cracking down on its supporters after the disputed elections on March 29.
Jiang said: "It is pointless for some people to politicise this issue. In the field of conventional weapons, we have trade relations with some countries. These are consistent with our laws and with security council resolutions and China's international obligations. We have been very responsible and cautious with regards to weapons exports."
There is no international arms embargo against Zimbabwe, and China is one of its main trade partners and allies.
The Foreign Office minister, Lord Malloch-Brown, welcomed the recall of the Chinese arms shipment.
"I think you will see huge action by government and civil society in the region, if necessary through the UN and elsewhere, to make sure no more arms reach this illegitimate government to allow it to suppress its people," he said.
The prime minister, Gordon Brown, yesterday called for a total arms embargo on Zimbabwe as he denounced president Mugabe's efforts to "rig the elections".
Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa backed Brown's call for an arms embargo.
"In the meantime I hope that every country will agree to a moratorium on the supply of any arms to the country," he said in a statement. "If violence flares further in Zimbabwe, those supplying the weapons will be left with blood on their hands."
But Jacob Zuma, who leads South Africa's ruling party, today said it was not yet time for an arms embargo on Harare.
Speaking in London, where he met Brown, the leader of the African National Congress said: "I don't think we have reached the stage for arms embargo, I think it is going too far and I think it complicates a situation that needs to be handled with great care."
The European Union already has an arms embargo against Zimbabwe, part of sanctions in place since 2002.
The embargo bars the 27 EU states from supplying arms or equipment intended for military operations. The US has also imposed sanctions on Mugabe's government.
BUFFALO – Like just about every hockey player, Steve Ott wore a visor as a youngster developing through the junior ranks. But the gritty Sabres winger ditched the facial protection when he cracked the NHL in 2002.
The visor bothered Ott. It cut him, fogged up and splashed water in his face. Playing without one made him feel more comfortable hitting.
But at the same time, he said it wasn't a big deal wearing one.
“You get used to it,” Ott said by phone Wednesday. “So it's not really a big change. It's been a thing for myself where … coming out of junior it probably would've been a lot easier for me to keep it on and I wouldn't have ever even noticed, you know what I mean?”
Now, young players won't enjoy the option Ott had 11 years ago. The NHL's competition committee voted Tuesday to grandfather in visors. Use will be mandatory next season for players with less than 26 games of big league experience.
“I think the No. 1 thing is they always want to keep the players as safe as possible,” Ott said.
Ott believes players should be able to choose if they wear a visor. Still, he understands why change is coming. Some high-profile eye injuries over the years, including an ugly March incident in which a puck hit New York Rangers defenseman Marc Staal, prompted action.
“I think it swayed everybody,” Ott said about Staal's gruesome injury. “I've played with teammates that have lost eyesight and everything else.”
While Staal has returned to the ice, his vision will likely never be the same.
With more players wearing a shield – usage is already at a reported 73 percent – Ott expects stick play will become looser.
“That's where I think the biggest issue (is) falling in with the guys that don't have one on,” Ott said. “ … When you don't have a visor on, obviously you show a little bit more respect. You try not to bring your stick up or you wouldn't have it up because it's in the back of your mind.”
Ott, one of four Sabres who doesn't wear a visor – Adam Pardy, John Scott and Mike Weber are the others – isn't sure if he'll start wearing one again.
He put one on for about 30 games after a scary incident at the end of the 2010-11 season.
“I got hit with the puck below my eye and the top of my cheekbone really bad,” Ott said.
But Ott shed it early the next season after only about 30 games. He said it was too hot wearing one.
“It was too much of a bothersome for me,” he said. “So I don't know (about wearing one again). I'd have to really look at it to decide.”

This is the shocking moment an Italian high school teacher was allegedly caught on camera flashing her bra to students during a raunchy classroom striptease.
Parents at the school, believed to be in Prato, Tuscany, are furious over the footage and are demanding the "disgusting" teacher's sacking.
The clip, thought to have been recorded on a student's phone, has been shared hundreds of times across social media.
The woman, whose name has not been confirmed, is an IT teacher, according to reports.
The bizarre video sees the blonde haired teacher dancing and playfully bouncing up and down to music before lifting up her top to flash her bra.

The 'striptease' video was reportedly captured in a classroom on a mobile phone by pupils.
It has now been posted on the 'Azione Giovani' ('Youth Action') Facebook page, deemed her behaviour 'shameful', reports the newspaper il Tirreno .

A representative from the group which released the video, Philip Balugani, told local media it must have come from a student at the school.
Italian teacher's striptease
Headmistress Maria Grazia Tempesti said she was shocked but declined to fully comment on the video.
But she said the school has started disciplinary action and had summoned other teachers to investigate the case.

Until now the school management had received no complaints about her behaviour.
A statement on the school's website on April 11 mentions that an "evaluation" of the situation was underway.
Four cases of travel related mosquito borne viruses on Oahu are being investigated. These cases are not related to the current outbeak on the Big Island.
The cases include an individual who traveled to Latin America and returned to the state ill.
According to the Hawai'i Department of Health, that individual is being tested for both the dengue and zika virus.
During a press conference Saturday afternnon, DOH Health Director Dr. Virginia Pressler said that the case underwent initial lab tests by the State Laboratories Division, however, the tests for two viruses can counter-interact, creating inconclusive results. Because of that, lab samples are being sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for further testing.
In addition to that case, DOH says three individuals are being tested for dengue fever and chikungunya. Those individuals have a history of travel to the Pacific Islands and Latin America.
One individual may have been infectious upon returning to the state, however, they are all no longer infectious, according to Dr. Pressler.
Dr. Pressler emphasized during the press conference that the cases are not locally acquired and are also not related to the Big Island dengue fever outbreak.

“The dengue fever outbreak on Hawai'i Island remains isolated to Hawai'i Island and we have only had a few cases over the past couple months,” Dr. Pressler said.
DOH first learned of the most recent Oahu case on Thursday, but were waiting for the correct time to alert the public.
DOH Vector Control teams on Oahu are investigating the four cases and taking measures to spray and assess residenal and other areas in urban Honolulu and North Shore.
Vector Control personnel on Oahu are sparse with the majority of the state's Vector Control resources on the Big Island, aiding in the island's dengue fever outbreak.
Dr. Pressler said in a two-week span, eight new Vector Control personnel will be on the Big Island. With new personnel on the Big Island, current resoures belonging to other locatons in the state will be able to return to their respective islands.
Dengue fever, Zika, and chikungunya are all mosquito borne viruses that are spread when a sick person is bitten by a mosquito, which later bites another person.
Evidence suggests that Zika can also be transmitted through unprotected sexual contact with someone who has been infected. The best way to prevent all these viruses is to take mosquito control measures and to avoid getting bitten. Some who carry Zika do not show symptoms, and in others, illness may last from several days to over a week. There is currently no cure for these viruses.
Next Friday, Dr. Pressler and other DOH personel will travel to CDC headquarters to participate in a Zika summit, where they wil complete a comprehensive approach with CDC assistance for potential future outbreaks of Zika in the islands.
“The department expects to see more of these travel related cases as outbreaks of all these diseases continue in other countries,” said Dr. Pressler. “The department is working closely with the counties and taking precautionary measures to respond to all suspected and confirmed cases. We ask for the public's help in reducing mosquito breeding areas around homes and workplaces and preventing mosquito bites by using repellant or protective clothing.”
Anyone who has traveled outside the country and has mild to severe symptoms such as fever, joint pain, rash, or red/pink eyes within 2 weeks after returning from travel should see their healthcare provider.
As of Friday, there had been 263 cases of dengue fever on the Big Island since the dengue outbreak began in September 2015.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Gov. Jerry Brown has vetoed plans to ban smoking and tobacco use on public university campuses in California.
The governor announced Monday that he took action on legislation that would have banned tobacco use on all 136 California State University and community college campuses. It would have prohibited chewing, dipping, smoking or vaping natural or synthetic tobacco products at the schools, which have about 2.5 million students and 100,000 staff and faculty.
The bill would have allowed school trustees and board members to decide whether to fine campus smokers up to $100. In a veto message, the Democratic governor noted that the schools' governing boards already have that authority “and are fully capable of setting smoking policies on their campuses.”
The money would have gone to support education programs at the campus where the violation occurred. Supporters said the bill would have helped decrease the harmful effects of nicotine and secondhand smoke.
Brown also announced that he signed legislation allowing state inspectors to seize and destroy used cigarette stamps, which are affixed to cigarette packaging to show tobacco has been legally purchased. It comes in response to inspectors recently finding large collections intended for reuse.
Brown has not yet taken action on another bill that would ban tobacco and electronic cigarettes at state parks and beaches in an effort to protect the environment from cigarette butts and prevent wildfires. People caught violating the law would face fines of up to $250.
The governor earlier this year approved tougher tobacco regulations as part of a special legislative session on health care, including boosting the legal age to buy tobacco to 21 and extending existing regulations governing tobacco to electronic cigarettes.
Californians also will weigh another attempt to raise taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products at the November ballot box. Proposition 56 would raise the per-pack tax on cigarettes by $2 and raise taxes on other tobacco and vaping products.
The tobacco industry has launched ads against the measure and is expected to spend heavily to try to defeat it.

An awesome event will be held this Monday by the Minnesota Timberwolves. In honor of the first practices of the season starting up, the Timberwolves will do a scrimmage and dunk contest at Minnesota State University-Mankato's Bresnan Arena. The doors to the arena will be open at 11 pm, and the players will take the floor at midnight.
“Dunks After Dark” is free and open to the public, though tickets are limited. This is a great opportunity to see how the new additions to the Timberwolves play, and see how they play with each other. Fans who don't want to or can't go to Mankato are also able to watch the event. “Dunks After Dark” will be on NBA TV and Timberwolves fans also can do live streaming through Timberwolves.com.
Fans unfamiliar with the new faces on the Timberwolves will definitely want to tune in. This is a great opportunity to watch the Timberwolves players interact with each other and a great chance to gauge the young talent before the season starts. Andrew Wiggins will definitely be a player to watch in the scrimmage and the dunk contest. It's more than likely that Flip Saunders the coach of the Timberwolves will use practices like this and training camp to determine whether or not Wiggins will be starting to start the regular season over Corey Brewer.
Additionally, this is the first chance in a long time to see the play of Zach LaVine, Anthony Bennett and Thaddeus Young playing real basketball for coaches and fans. While Young is established already as in NBA player, “Dunks After Dark” will help fans learn more about how the inexperienced LaVine and Bennett have improved since Summer League, where both players definitely impressed in terms of athleticism and improvement.
This is also unique in that the scrimmages will allow fans to see how Timberwolves players play against each other. For instance, who will win the battle of the bigs when Nikola Pekovic and Gorgui Dieng guard each other? Dieng is more athletic and taller, but Pekovic is a tank in the post and is much more polished offensively. Along with this it will be interesting to see Ricky Rubio going up against Mo Williams, the veteran point the Timberwolves signed via free agency.
Finally, fans of the Timberwolves will want to watch this event for the dunk contest, as this will definitely be the highlight of the program. The dunk contest will feature Wiggins versus LaVine, two players who are known for their supreme dunking ability. This could be a preview for the NBA dunk contest that is held over All-Star weekend, as both players will definitely be considered for the Dunk Contest. Remember September 29th, “Dunk After Dark” will turn into a great preseason tradition for this team.
Noah Baumbach burst onto the cinematic scene with the triple-hilarious Kicking and Screaming, anointed by the Criterion Collection as an important contemporary film good enough to be collected alongside master like Akira Kurosawa, Jean Remoir, Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini among others. His work has evolved over time, often abandoning the comedic nature of his first feature for more dramatic fare such as The Squid and the Whale and Margot at the Wedding. His return to the more comedic arena happened with 2013's Frances Ha, featuring almost exclusively Greta Gerwig who appeared in his underwhelming Greenberg. Few actresses have a persona that carries through their roles that is as infectiously fun as Greta Gerwig. And it is on full display here in Frances Ha.
The story of the film is pretty simple. Frances is an apprentice dancer in a company in New York City. She understands that she's not very good, but sallies forth in this, her chosen “profession” trying to make it work. She teaches kids' ballet classes on the side to help supplement her income. She has a boyfriend (Michael Esper) who is really doing it for her on really any level. She and her best friend Sophie (Mickey Sumner, daughter of musician Sting) are like two peas in a pod and it's with Sophie that she finds her true soul mate. But when Sophie takes things to the next level with her boyfriend/fiancee Patch (Patrick Heusinger), she breaks the team up, moves out and isn't there for Frances as much. From here, things spiral downward quickly for Frances as she finds herself out of the dance company with no boyfriend and a best friend who is moving along with her life and leaving her behind.
A gender twist on the standard Knocked Up-like man/child storyline except far superior to anything Judd Apatow has ever committed to the big screen, Frances Ha is quirky, funny and pertinent. We can't help but to wince as Frances makes poor choice after poorer choice time and time again. That said, she does it with humor and a touch of grace throughout. Here is Frances at her finest:
Shot in beautiful black and white by Wendy & Lucy DP Sam Levy, Frances Ha jumps off the screen. With great cameos by Girls‘ Adam Driver and Kicking and Screaming‘s Josh Hamilton, this film is populated with funny and interesting characters that add value to every scene. And to add, another testament to how awesome Greta Gerwig is, she also co-wrote the film with Baumbach. She is a talented lady and I truly believe she deserved an Oscar nomination for her performance. Top-notch in every way.
This film is available for streaming on Netflix and YouTube.
Here's the trailer:
It is, perhaps, the insult that resonates with President-elect Donald Trump like no other. Of the thousands upon thousands of derogatory remarks hurled his way over the years, the nickname given to him in the pages of the now-defunct satirical magazine Spy — “short-fingered vulgarian” — appears to have gnawed at him ever since it was published in 1988.
But now, in what can only be considered to be the unlikeliest of meetings, Donald Trump is going to sit down with one of the men who coined that moniker, Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter.
Politico reports that Trump will visit the offices of Conde Nast on Friday for an off-the-record with the publisher's editorial leadership. Carter will be present for the meeting. As will Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue — which endorsed a Presidential candidate for the first time in its history in 2016 when it backed Hillary Clinton. Wintour has already met with Trump since the election, having visited Trump Tower on Dec. 13.
Vanity Fair was in the President-elect's crosshairs just a few weeks ago, when it published a review of the Trump Grill, the restaurant inside Trump Tower. The review panned the eatery, calling it “the worst restaurant in America.”
That review set off a back-and-forth between Trump and the Vanity Fair Twitter account.
Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016
Vanity Fair: way up, big success, alive! Subscribe today! https://t.co/OR81gIv44s — VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) December 15, 2016
But several weeks after that social media skirmish, the President-elect is now apparently willing to visit the magazine's headquarters, and sit down with the man who famously called him a “short-fingered vulgarian” all those years ago.

Merry Christmas Week everyone. Another weekend packed with NBA games and solid performances from Pacific Northwest players.
Let's get right into it.
FRIDAY
The trio of Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and Jeff Green all had solid outings for the Celtics, and helped take down Zach LaVine (7 points on 3-7 shooting) and the Minnesota Timberwolves, 114-98.
Olnyk helped usher in life after Rajon Rondo for the Celtics, by scoring a team high 21 points (8-13 FG). He knocked down two of his four three point attempts, and also added eight rebounds. This last week was Olyknyk's strongest stretch of the season so far, as he scored over 15 points in three of the four games he played in, including a career high 30 points Monday against the 76ers. He also threw down an impressive dunk over two Orlando Magic defenders on Wednesday, set up by a brilliant pump fake drive from the three point line.
The second year big man from Gonzaga has mainly come off the bench this season, as second year coach Brad Stevens has seemed to prefer starting Tyler Zeller at the center position. That's probably due to the larger issue with Olynyk's consistency this season. He has failed to record a single point following a performance of scoring at least 18 points. It's probably unreasonable to expect Olynyk to score 15-20 points per game, but we can hope that he is able to build off of this solid week of production.
Jeff Green and Avery Bradley saw their long time point guard Rajon Rondo shipped to Dallas on Friday, signaling the rebuilding era for the Celtics. Both players had nice performances on Friday. Bradley chipped in 14 points (6-14 FG) and seven assists. Green scored 18 points on nearly an identical performance from the field (6-13 FG). He added two threes, and connected on all four of his attempts from the charity stripe.
There has long been speculation that the Celtics may trade Green this season, and as A. Sharrod Bailey of Comcast Sportsnet points out, Green is in a similar situation to Rondo. He is 28 years old, and there are questions of whether or not the Celtics will be able to resign him in the off season, as he will likely opt out of his contract.
The Celtics may look to accumulate as many draft picks and shed as much money as possible to clear cap space, in the hopes of pursuing some big time free agents in the 2016 free agent class (headlined by Kevin Durant). However, if the Celtics want to stay semi-competitive in the next few years, and if they believe that Green, who will be a seasoned veteran wing by 2016, will be able to help attract a big free agent in either 2015 or 2016, they may choose to keep Green. It will be interesting to see what happens.
The Clippers and Nuggets game ended up providing a great Seattle-based match up. Nate Robinson stole the show, scoring 20 points in only 16 minutes, going 4-9 from three and 6-11 from the field.This was a classic Nate Robinson game, as he hit some ridiculous threes, and also had some amazing drives to the rim. (Highlights here)
I will never understand how he is able to finish over seven footers. Robinson has had a tough start to the season, he hasn't played over 25 minutes all year, and has scored double digit points a mere four times, so needless to say, it was nice to see Robinson put on a show and help propel the Nuggets to a 109-106 victory.
Jamal Crawford did his part Friday, scoring 20 points on 45% from the field. He connected on just one three point attempts, but knocked down all five of his free throw attempts. Robinson and Crawford are two of the most recognizable players from this area in the NBA today, so it was pretty fun to see both of them have big nights against one another.

SATURDAY
Saturday was a relatively quiet night for the Pacific Northwest, but Isaiah Thomas and Aron Baynes (?!!!) did their part to carry the load.
IT helped the uneven Suns dispatch the lowly Knicks 99-90. He scored 22 points on 7-12 from the field, and also knocked down three trey balls.
It's been a weird season so far for Thomas, after a hot start, it looked as though the Thomas and the Suns, who employ two other stellar point guards in Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic, would jell well together. However, the Suns have cooled off and currently find themselves outside of the playoff picture at 15-14, and look to have taken a step back after their break out season last year.
The three point guards don't seem to look entirely comfortable playing together, and Thomas has been the odd man out, averaging just 24.4 minutes per game (Bledsoe and Dragic average 32.8 and 32.3 MPG, respectively). There have been rumblings that the Suns may trade Thomas, and this speculation was fueled when Thomas fired his agent last week. I still think that the Suns can turn it around, and that they have a good chance of wrestling the eighth seed away from the Pelicans, mainly because the Pelicans play in the cutthroat Southwest Division. However, if the Suns can't turn it around by the trade deadline, IT may be on his way out of Phoenix.
Coming off two straight triple overtime losses, the Spurs chose to rest Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili. Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard, and Patty Mills were also out Saturday, so needless to say, there were quite a few opportunities for the bench players.
Aron Baynes took full advantage of said opportunity, as he notched a double-double. He scored 16 points and adding 10 rebounds. Baynes is known for setting hard screens, boxing out well, and scrapping with players who have superior talent, so it is awesome to see him record a double-double and shoot the ball well. Is Baynes taking 11 shots a game the answer for the Spurs, who has now lost three straight? No, of course not. Though it is awesome when a hard worker like Baynes is rewarded.

SUNDAY
Sunday was another quiet day for the Pacific Northwest, but Terrence Ross did have a nice game. He scored 18 points on 46% from the field, 12 of those points coming from behind the arc. Ross and the Raptors continue to win with the absence of their All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan, as their record improved to 22-6 following their 118-108 victory over New York.
Of course, Drake approves.

UPDATE: After user feedback we have made changes to the mockups and screenshots. These are outlined in italics in the main text.
Onboarding users to the IOTA platform…
Well we have to put our hands up here. The experience has been slightly lacking.
The underlying technology of IOTA is significantly different to other cryptocurrencies, which has resulted in some user confusion. IOTA has also attracted many users who are new to cryptocurrencies, who may not be fully aware of the different paradigm in cryptocurrency (vs fiat currency).
We aim to improve the experience with this UI refresh, and would like the onboarding process to set the correct tone. Our main focus is to educate users about the technology, and to ensure that the wallet is set up in the most secure (but still usable) way possible.
To achieve this aim, we will take a slightly paternalistic default approach to wallet setup. Although paternalism is not the usual approach in crypto, we feel that this will improve understanding and security in the medium to long term.
These are our initial thoughts and mockups for the onboarding process. This is a flow which we think may work well, but feedback would be gratefully received.
THE Iranian government has opened a sinister kids' war-based theme park which instead of roller-coasters and roundabouts has military checkpoints and AK47s.
The City of Games for Revolutionary Children park lets youngsters dress up in full combat gear and pretend to be attacking Iran's enemies like Israel and the West.

MEMRI / Raja News 5 The park is for boys aged 8-13 and entry is free
They are shown how to fire plastic bullets and artillery shells at US flags and at an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Instructors have built control towers, sand-bagged check-points stuffed with replica assault rifles, grenades and land-mines and radios to rely on messages to the child soldiers.
There's also assault courses where they can learn to scale walls and crawl under ropes and through barbed wire while orders are barked at them by trainers and the sound of machine gun fire is played through speakers.
It is aimed at boys aged 8-13 and entry is free to the park near Mashad, Iran's second largest city.
It also glorifies the Holy Defence – Iran's bloody eight war with Iraq in the 1980s.

The park's boss Hamid Sadeghi said: “At the City of Games, we are trying to convey to the children messages about fighting, the Holy Defence and current global issues, through games, amusements, and group activities."
They are also shown what it is like to fight ISIS in Syria.
And there is a mock-up of the Shrine of Zaynab mosque, located in the Syrian capital Damascus and holds the remains of Mohammed's granddaughter, which they are ordered to defend.
The kids also play a word game which involves “finding bullets, each of which have a single letter written on it,” and using the bullets to spell out words and sentences.

The final exercise of the day is meant to teach children that “the most important elements for attaining victory are wisdom and intelligence for fighting the enemy.”
Boys are blindfolded and asked to throw a ball at an Israeli flag in the form of a puzzle and knock it down, and then to assemble a puzzle of an Iranian flag.
SOLAR
It is pretty much useless during the short winter days… we got maybe 10-20Ah charge total from solar during the whole week (guesstimate). Even on a sunny day, mid-day, we got almost nothing coming in. We still cleared the solar panels from the snow that fell overnight and this is fairly easy to do with a ladder. This shows the importance of being able to charge while driving. We went with a 30A smart charger; I wish we went with 50A-60A charger (like the Sterling Power Battery-to-Battery charger) to charge faster (shorter drives). Also, we noticed that the smart charger will reduce the charge rate as the SOC is getting closer to 100%; it really takes a long time to charge the battery from 80% to 100%.
(see our Solar Panels Installation Post and our Electrical System Design Post)
POWER CONSUMPTION
We found that we use a bit more power in winter. Days are shorter, so we use more lights. We want to prevent the interior of the van from freezing (water supplies, beer bottles explosions…), so the heater runs continuously and draw around 1.7A approx on average 24h/24h (this varies a lot with the outside temps). The duty cycle of the fridge is around 10%, compared to around 35% in summer.
WEBASTO HEATER
We got nights where the temps went down to -15F (-25C). The Webasto was able to maintain the temperature inside the van. However, it takes a long time (1-2 hours) to raise the temperature from, let's say, 40F to 65F. On very cold nights, the heater was working on High mode continuously. The 3.7 gasoline engine heat up quite fast on idle; it could be used to raise the temperatures faster.
(see our Webasto Installation Post)
INSULATION
All the Thinsulate was installed for the trip. The ceiling and one of the wall was finished; the other wall still had the metal exposed. We could feel a HUGE difference between the finished wall VS the other. The finished wall (thinsulate + ez-cool + wood paneling) was not cold to the touch. The unfinished wall was freezing near the floor and was sending us cold draft. This trip gave us confidence about our insulation choice.
(see our Thinsulate Installation Post)
TRACTION
No surprise here, the Transit is not an off-road vehicle (we have the Limited Slip). It drives really well on snowy roads, but things get more complicated in ski resort parking lots and such. We found out that a semi-hard-pack snow layer over an ice layer will make the Transit rather useless. We did not get stuck, we went wherever we wanted, but we could feel the limitation of traction. We carried snow chains just in case.
× Wisconsin Democrats urge GOP to hold pot referendum
MADISON — Democratic lawmakers are calling on Republicans to let the public weigh in on whether Wisconsin should join 28 other states that have legalized medical marijuana.
Rep. Chris Taylor and Sen. Jon Erpenbach have introduced a bill that would let Wisconsin residents vote in an advisory referendum on whether marijuana should be legalized for medical use. They've introduced another bill that would actually legalize the drug for that purpose.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, a Juneau Republican, has said he'll never support legalizing medical marijuana.
Regardless, Taylor and Erpenbach tried to drum up support for their bills at a news conference Monday, telling reporters that the state is failing sick people by not letting them use marijuana. They said Republican leaders should at least ask the public what it wants.

The parallel movement in the visual arts can be witnessed in paintings of storms and shipwrecks showing the terror and irrational destruction wrought by nature. These pre-romantic works were fashionable in Germany from the 1760s on through the 1780s, illustrating a public audience for emotionally provocative artwork. Additionally, disturbing visions and portrayals of nightmares were gaining an audience in Germany as evidenced by Goethe's possession and admiration of paintings by Fuseli capable of 'giving the viewer a good fright.'[13] Notable artists included Joseph Vernet, Caspar Wolf, Philip James de Loutherbourg, and Henry Fuseli.

As I write this, we are 24 hours away from the end of this seemingly endless presidential campaign, and all the signs point to a victory  some would say an overwhelming victory  by Barack Obama. I won't make any predictions here, what with the Bradley Effect and other unknowns  including the possibility of a "hanging chad"-like situation  but, given the polls, it's incumbent on me to give my readers an indication of what to expect from an Obama administration in the foreign policy department, and this is undoubtedly reflected in the personnel he'll assemble on his foreign policy team.
So who's up for major appointments? A number of names have been floated, some of them Republicans, for key positions like secretary of defense and secretary of state, notably the idea of keeping Robert Gates, the current defense chief, and bringing in Richard Lugar for secretary of state. Both possibilities underscore the essential continuity of our misguided and increasingly dangerous foreign policy of global intervention. Bill Richardson is also being mentioned for state, along with John "I Was For It Before I Was Against It" Kerry.
This particular appointment, however, doesn't tell us much about the foreign policy favored by Obama. Recent secretaries of state have had minimal influence on actual policymaking and have often been at odds with the White House; look at Colin Powell. This is due to the ever-increasing power of the president over the conduct of U.S. foreign policy, a realm surrendered to the executive by Congress, in principle, long ago. Under President Bush, the process accelerated and the foreign policymaking bureaucracy took on a distinctly monarchical flavor. The president's national security adviser, the one with direct access to the king, became the key player. Condi Rice, with her personal friendship with Bush II, was perfect for this role, and the next national security adviser is liable to play a similarly important part in shaping Obama's decisions.
The most troubling possibility here is Dennis Ross, a career foreign policy bureaucrat who was instrumental in shaping America's Israel-centric policy in the Middle East under George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. He is a longtime associate of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), the scholarly adjunct of AIPAC, Israel's powerful lobbying organization in the U.S., which he co-founded.
The beginning of Ross' career as a civil servant is a good indicator of what we might expect from him, and from the Obama administration when it comes to setting Middle Eastern policy. When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, he brought in Paul Wolfowitz to run the policy planning at the State Department, and Wolfie brought in his neocon buddies: I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, Francis Fukuyama, Zalmay Khalilzad, James Roche, Stephen Sestanovich, Alan Keyes (yes, that Alan Keyes!), and Ross. In short, Ross has always been a reliable member in good standing of the neocon foreign policy cabal, the very same group that lied us into war with Iraq  and is now intent on doing the same with Iran. Although the neocons who came to Washington were mostly ex-Democrats, Ross stayed with his old party, although partisan allegiances seem not to mean much to him. He has served under three secretaries of state: James Baker, Warren Christopher, and Madeleine Albright.
As special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton, Ross was responsible for managing the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, a process described by former negotiating team member Aaron David Miller as follows:
"With the best of motives and intentions, we listened to and followed Israel's lead without critically examining what that would mean for our own interests, for those on the Arab side and for the overall success of the negotiations. The ‘no surprises' policy, under which we had to run everything by Israel first, stripped our policy of the independence and flexibility required for serious peacemaking. If we couldn't put proposals on the table without checking with the Israelis first, and refused to push back when they said no, how effective could our mediation be? Far too often, particularly when it came to Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy, our departure point was not what was needed to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides but what would pass with only one  Israel."
"Without critically examining what that would mean for our own interests"  that's the key phrase here, one that fully describes the effect (and also, perhaps, the intention) of our Middle Eastern policy, one that puts Israel, not America, first.
Ross recently signed on to a plan, being pushed by something called the Bipartisan Policy Center, that is nothing but a roadmap to war with Tehran. The report, written in the form of recommendations to an incoming president, says he must begin a military buildup directed at Iran from "the first day [he] enters office." The plan is to begin "pre-positioning additional U.S. and allied forces, deploying additional aircraft carrier battle groups and minesweepers, placing other war material in the region, including additional missile defense batteries, upgrading both regional facilities and allied militaries, and expanding strategic partnerships with countries such as Azerbaijan and Georgia in order to maintain operational pressure from all directions."
Yes, Georgia, America's Israel of the Caucasus, is to be used as a forward base of operations against Iran. Then there's the oil-rich tyranny of Azerbaijan, which is locked in a vicious ethnic war of attrition with Armenia (and its own Armenian population). The U.S. footprint, instead of shrinking under Obama, promises to grow even larger.
So you wondered why, during the debates, Obama was so belligerent on the Georgian question. Obama and McCain both hew to the War Party's Orwellian view, which grotesquely inverts the truth, decrying "Russian aggression" when it was the Georgians who started that war. One would normally expect this of McCain, whose chief foreign policy adviser was, until very recently, a paid lobbyist for the Georgians, but Obama, too, refuses to acknowledge Tbilisi's aggression against a "breakaway province." Ossetia has been de facto independent for more than a decade, and the supposedly smart Obama is no doubt aware of this  never mind the hundreds killed in the siege of Tskhinvali, the Ossetian capital city mercilessly assaulted by Georgian troops.
It gets worse, however. Underscoring the point we have long made at Antiwar.com  that it is impossible to separate these various "theaters" of U.S. aggression, and that the Iraq and Afghan wars are bound to spread  the report goes on to note:
"The presence of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan offers distinct advantages in any possible confrontation with Iran. The United States can bring in troops and material to the region under the cover of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, thus maintaining a degree of strategic and tactical surprise." [Emphasis added.]
Obama has long stressed he would immediately begin escalating the Afghan campaign, and perhaps open up a new front in Pakistan. Certainly the Bush administration has laid the groundwork for this eastward shift of U.S. military resources  and so the stage is set.
When Rachel Maddow asked Obama the other day why our intervention in Afghanistan wouldn't end up like the Iraq war, or more so, he emphatically rejected the comparison, yet he never addressed her underlying concern. She just smiled, rather wanly, and went on to the next question. I have another question, however, and it is this: what if the Afghan "surge" is a feint, directed not at some vague Taliban-affiliated tribes in the godforsaken wilds of Waziristan, but at the mullahs of Tehran?
Under the pretext of going after Osama bin Laden, they can sneak enough troops into the region through the back door, then easily launch an attack from the east, and also from the north, where the Azeris and the Georgians are talking about entering NATO. (Obama, by the way, fully endorses Georgia's NATO membership application, although he hasn't said anything, as far as I know, about the Azeris' ambition to join the club.)
Whether or not Ross gets the national security post, the fact remains that the War Party, far from being banished from Washington, will have an inside track in the new administration. What's different about Obama, however, is that the other side also has a seat at the table  or, at the very least, isn't completely locked out of the deliberations. I was astonished to learn that none other than Gen. Anthony Zinni, retired Marine commander and trenchant critic of the neocon influence on the making of American foreign policy, is up for the job. A 2003 Washington Post profile of Zinni reports:
"The more he listened to [Deputy Defense Secretary Paul] Wolfowitz and other administration officials talk about Iraq, the more Zinni became convinced that interventionist ‘neoconservative' ideologues were plunging the nation into a war in a part of the world they didn't understand. ‘The more I saw, the more I thought that this was the product of the neocons who didn't understand the region and were going to create havoc there. These were dilettantes from Washington think tanks who never had an idea that worked on the ground.'
“The goal of transforming the Middle East by imposing democracy by force reminds him of the ‘domino theory' in the 1960s that the United States had to win in Vietnam to prevent the rest of Southeast Asia from falling into communist hands. And that brings him back to Wolfowitz and his neoconservative allies as the root of the problem. ‘I don't know where the neocons came from  that wasn't the platform they ran on,' he says. ‘Somehow, the neocons captured the president. They captured the vice president.'”
I wouldn't bet the farm on Zinni getting it, but the fact that he's in the running at all is astonishing. If that's the amount of change you want in American foreign policy, then you'll be happy with the Obama administration  even as they escalate the conflict in Afghanistan, spread it to Pakistan, and prepare for war with Iran.

INDIANAPOLIS — At last year's NFL scouting combine, Vikings general manager Rick Spielman was on a relentless search for a quarterback. Now, he can look back and laugh.
That's because when last year's combine started, many people were projecting Teddy Bridgewater as the No. 1 pick in the draft. After a disappointing pro day performance in March, he slid to the Vikings with the last pick in the first round, 32nd overall.
“I'm thankful the media did him a disservice, in my opinion, last year by judging him on his pro day,” Spielman said Wednesday during a break from the combine at Lucas Oil Stadium.
After Bridgewater's impressive rookie season, the Vikings obviously aren't looking as hard at quarterbacks this year. But Spielman said they are considering bringing in a young quarterback for the No. 3 spot if Christian Ponder “is not here.”
Ponder becomes a free agent next month and is unlikely to return. Ten-year veteran Matt Cassel remains under contract and signs point to him staying on as Bridgewater's backup.
Cassel is under contract in 2015 for $4.75 million, but the Vikings can release him next month without any further financial obligation.
Spielman said every player must be evaluated in accordance with his contract.
“We assess all our guys, and Matt's done a great job,” Spielman said. “He came in and has won some games when he had to play, and he's a great locker room guy. Matt has a lot of value to us.”
Spielman said a more pressing need is at linebacker. Starting middle linebacker Jasper Brinkley will become a free agent, and outside linebacker Chad Greenway likely won't return unless he agrees to accept less than the $7 million he is owed in 2015.
The Vikings have the No. 11 pick in the April 30-May 2 draft.
Linebacker is “an area we'll look at,” Spielman said. “We'll weigh in on that position. We're very excited about where (2014 draftee) Anthony Barr is, but we want to continue to build in that area.”
Other Minnesota needs are at wide receiver, cornerback, offensive line and running back. Even if star Adrian Peterson returns after missing 15 games last season because of a child-abuse incident, the Vikings could draft a running back in a later round.
“This is one of the deepest running back classes I can remember in a while,” Spielman said.
Spielman said the draft also is deep at wide receiver and on the offensive line, and there is speculation Minnesota's first-round pick will be the best remaining receiver among Amari Cooper of Alabama, Kevin White of West Virginia and DeVante Parker of Louisville.
Parker is intriguing because he played three seasons with Bridgewater. But Spielman said that wouldn't necessarily improve his chances of playing in Minnesota.
“That has no influence on who we're looking at,” Spielman said. “We're going to look at who's best for us, regardless.”
Among other topics Spielman addressed Wednesday:
— He said playing Pittsburgh in the Aug. 9 Hall of Fame Game will help give the Vikings an extra preseason game and week of practice. If not for the game, Spielman said, the Vikings would have spent two weeks of training camp in Mankato instead of three.
— He said it's unlikely the Vikings will make a huge splash in free agency. “I don't believe in going out and spending a huge amount of money in free agency unless it's something unique.”
— He plans to meet this week with Cordarrelle Patterson's agent, Joby Branion. Spielman is confident the wide receiver can regain the form he had as a rookie in 2013 following a disappointing 2014. Patterson has begun offseason workouts in California.

Ben Affleck says he lifted a memento from the Justice League set — and was promptly billed by studio Warner Bros.
"They kept track of the Batmobile," Affleck said when asked by The Late Show host Stephen Colbert if he kept any of the "cool toys" Batman is known to use in his crime-fighting arsenal. "But there was some other stuff that fell off the truck, like the batarangs and stuff. I kept getting these phone calls from the prop department, like, ‘You sure you haven't found any of that stuff yet?'"
Pressed by Colbert, Affleck admitted he stole a batarang — the bat-shaped, metallic projectiles used by Batman to strike enemies from a distance.
"You can't exactly have been stealing if you got billed for it, which is what happened to me," Affleck said, adding that Warner Bros. sent him a bill for his swiped souvenir. "Turns out batarangs aren't cheap!"
During his visit to The Late Show promoting Justice League, Affleck addressed his alleged misconduct and his past connection with disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein as well as Donald Trump's 2013 Batfleck endorsement.
Affleck again made headlines recently as his tenure as the Dark Knight continues to be in doubt, with rumors arriving Thursday that Matt Reeves, director of the upcoming The Batman, is reportedly interested in having Donnie Darko and Stronger actor Jake Gyllenhaal don the cowl for the Bat's first solo movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises.
Justice League, starring Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Amy Adams, is now playing.

Afghanistan has hired an English head coach for their national cricket side.
Andy Moles batted for Warwickshire until 1997, and has coached at international level before in Scotland and Kenya.
He said that since they heard the news that he was coming, his friends have been asking him "Are you sure? It is a war zone."
He was assured by his new employers that the Taliban now approve of cricket and would not disrupt coaching.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andy Moles was an opening batsman for Warwickshire before he turned to coaching
Cricket was hardly played at all in Afghanistan until 2001, but was brought back from refugee camps in Pakistan, and is now hugely popular, played on every bit of waste ground.
When the national team qualified for the World Cup last October, beating Kenya, there were huge celebrations across Kabul, with celebratory gunfire going late into the night.
And more people watched the recent cricket league final on TV than voted in the country's still disputed election.
The CEO of the Afghan cricket board Noor Mohammad Murad said: "Cricket is not only a sport in Afghanistan, it's more important than that."
He said that Mr Moles had agreed some weeks ago to join the coaching team as a batting specialist, but was promoted when the head coach Kabir Khan unexpectedly resigned for family reasons.
The Afghan team already has other international coaches in its team, and Mr Murad is ambitious for success.
He said that the team is not going to the World Cup in 2015 to participate. They are going to win.
After his first training session with his new team, Mr Moles was impressed. He has six months to develop his 20-man squad, and for much of that time they will be training in Australia and New Zealand, where the World Cup is going to be played, getting used to conditions.
He said that the main problem for professional players outside the core group of test-playing nations is how much competition they have.
"In other countries, the main problem is they don't play enough cricket. The exact opposite is here."
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Any patch of ground can become a makeshift cricket pitch in Afghanistan
Afghanistan currently rank 11th in the world. But they have beaten some giants in the past, including Pakistan, and are looking to get at least into the last eight at the World Cup next year.
Mr Moles is realistic. He said that on paper the team will not get into the last eight, but might progress "with a bit of belief and passion, and some good cricket, and maybe one or two sides not playing at their best, if we have a good day".
In one-day cricket, individual stars can turn the course of a game, and in fast bowler Hamid Hassan, and the captain, all rounder Muhammad Nabi, Afghanistan have players of genuine world class.
Mr Moles said that he was working on the mental, physical and technical aspects of the game for each player.
"My personal wish is that we compete every game, and if we do that, then we might just win one or two that we shouldn't perhaps on paper, and if that happens we don't know where we'll go to."

Polls will be open in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. You must be a registered Republican or Democrat to cast a ballot.

In what appears to be the busiest New York primary day in recent memory, Lower Hudson Valley voters were already waiting at many places when the polls opened at 6 a.m., and election officials reported an unusually high number casting ballots throughout the day.
"We've been consistently busy all day," said Lesly Sandoval, an election inspector at New Rochelle High School. "There were tons of people when we opened this morning. ... There's been a consistent stream the rest of the day. We've had more voters than usual and that's without the super busy time which will be around 5 to 9 tonight. I'm glad people decided to get up and vote.”
Similar reports came from Mount Kisco, Yonkers, Nyack and throughout the region, as many people made their pick for the Republican or Democratic presidential candidates before heading off to work, school, or whatever else they had planned for the day.
And while Nyack reported a few incidents of people not being registered or not listed as living within the voting district, for the most part, election officials said, things were running smoothly.
"It's early, but we're off to a good start," said Joseph Leechack, an election inspector at St. Ann's School in Yonkers, where 21 votes had been cast by 7 a.m.
The polls were to remain open until 9 p.m.

At Chappaqua's Grafflin Elementary School, where Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, voted shortly after 8 a.m., turnout was "huge," said Paula Kurth, elections chairperson for New Castle District 1. In what she described as "a very high turnout," more than 180 people voted in the first two hours.
"People were here at five minutes to 6 (a.m.) waiting to vote. One man was tapping his watch," Kurth said. "It's exciting."
The state's presidential primary could play a significant role in determining the presidential nominees for the first time in decades, with contested races in both parties.
There are 291 Democratic delegates and 95 Republican delegates up for grabs. It is not a winner-take-all primary, so the delegates will be divided among the candidates based on the ballots cast by registered party voters.
In Nyack, poll workers said turnout was larger than in previous years. By 8:30 a.m., more than 60 people had voted at Grace Episcopal Church and Living Christ Church — almost double the usual number.
"I was surprised at how many people came right at 6 a.m. — it was way more than usual for a primary," said Gladys Najara, a poll inspector at Rochambeau School in White Plains. "To be honest, I like it. It's better when we're busy."

Poll Inspector Olga Klimak, also at Rochambeau School, said she expected "a larger turnout than we've had in previous primaries. Both parties are having controversial primaries, which raises voter interest."
Klimak, who's worked as a poll inspector for 15 years, said "we get about 50 voters in most primary elections. "We've probably had close to that already, and it's only 10 o'clock. It was very busy between 6 and 8 a.m. We're in a lull now, but it will get busy again at lunchtime, and again between 5 and 8 p.m., as people get home from work."
At Tarrytown Village Hall, election inspector Karin Arduino said residents who haven't voted in previous primaries were turning out this year.
"There are a lot of new voters — voters I'm not used to seeing," Arduino said.
It was busier than usual at the Village Hall polling place when it first opened at 6 a.m., and the turnout was steady most of the morning, said Julia Young, another inspector.
"There's a lot of people coming out," she said.
At the Mount Kisco courthouse, 141 people had voted by 1:30 p.m.
"People are encouraging people to vote — that's pretty clear," said election inspector Perry Wootten.
At Chestnut Ridge Village Hall shortly after 4 p.m., poll workers said turnout throughout the day was on par with previous primaries. After the morning rush before voters headed off to work, traffic died down significantly but poll workers expected it would pick up after dinnertime.
The Republican table had been much slower than the Democratic side of the room, one poll worker said, which wasn't surprising in the heavily Democratic district.

In New York, only registered voters enrolled as a Republican or Democrat may vote in the party primaries.
On the Democratic ballot, the candidates are Clinton, a former U.S. Senator and Secretary of State, and Bernie Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont and native of Brooklyn.
On the Republican ballot, the candidates are billionaire developer Donald Trump, who lives in Manhattan and is a Queens native; Ted Cruz, a U.S. Senator from Texas; and John Kasich, the governor of Ohio.
While voting was going without a hitch in the Lower Hudson Valley, that was not the case in New York City, where voters took to social media to report polling places opening late and broken ballot scanners. Michael Ryan, executive director of the city's Board of Elections, said he was aware of complaints at two sites in Brooklyn.
"The polls that opened late were as a result of poll site coordinators not showing up on time. We have 1,200 poll sites throughout the city and over 3,000 poll workers,” Ryan said. “Some might not show up on time, it is not an unprecedented or entirely unexpected event.”
He said that there are issues with scanners during every election and that backups are available at each polling site.
How to vote
Polls are open today in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Manatee County deputies and residents square off, after 'gang unit' members roam annual Mardi Gras fest taking up-close pictures
At first glance it looks like a bad rap video — a phalanx of officers walking through a neighborhood, residents yelling taunts and obscenities, while Ice-T's “F--- the Police” is pumping out of a stereo at full volume.
The video was shot by an unknown Rubonia resident during the annual Mardi Gras celebration Feb. 24 and later posted on YouTube.
It shows the Manatee County Sheriff's gang unit snapping pictures of residents with their cellphones — sometimes inches from their faces — while residents take pictures of the deputies, in a tense standoff of sorts.
It also shows two arrests.
Bradenton attorney Charles Britt III, a former deputy who represents one of those arrested, says he wants more videos — they can be delivered anonymously — that were taken by residents during the encounter, because he believes they will prove his client's innocence.
Britt, a civil rights attorney and a police practices expert have concerns about the tactics used by the gang unit during the popular celebration.
“The video shows the officers standing with scowls, flexing their muscles in front of one group of eight or nine friends, who are standing on their own property,” Britt said. “ ‘Provocative' is a word for it. It certainly is intimidating to say the least.”
Wearing shirts marked “gang unit” and walking onto people's front yards to take their picture inches from their face, “is not really a Community Oriented Policing effort,” said Sarasota civil rights attorney Andrea Mogensen.
“If the purpose of that assignment was to prevent crime and not escalate it — based on that footage — it is not the case,” Mogensen said.
While Manatee County Sheriff Brad Steube would not comment on the two arrests because the cases are pending, he said that his deputies did nothing wrong.
“They were protecting themselves and their fellow deputies as we went about doing our business,” Steube said. “I'm sure that music was not provocative or confrontational to law enforcement.”
The sheriff would not confirm that his gang unit was taking photos of gang members or suspected gang members.
“They were taking video of people in the crowd at the Mardi Gras,” Steube said. “It could be that, it could be just a matter of documenting that area of Rubonia, because that's where we had our hot spot.”
Michele Hall, general counsel for the sheriff's office, denied a public records request from the Herald-Tribune for the deputies' videos, claiming they “constitute active criminal intelligence information, or active criminal investigative information.”
The arrests
Rudy Lee Gonzalez, 23 — the first person to be arrested in the February confrontation — was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer.
According to an arrest report written by Deputy Leon Pollock, “Gonzalez was with numerous males that were taunting law enforcement during the day. They continued to play very loud music saying “F--- THE POLICE.”
Pollock reported that he arrested Gonzalez because the man “intentionally threw an unknown substance on my leg.” The unknown substance was some sort of liquid.
Pollock acknowledged that he did not actually see Gonzalez throw the liquid at him, instead: “The Hispanic male was the only subject near me.”
“There were 30 people walking around there with drinks,” countered Britt, the defense attorney. “It could have been anyone.”
Deputies also found a pot cigar, or “blunt,” in Gonzalez's pocket.
While deputies were arresting Gonzalez, Britt's client Connie Silva got involved.
The 24-year-old State College of Florida student had no prior criminal record before attending the Mardi Gras celebration with her family.
“She wasn't even there with the guys playing the music,” Britt said. “She was there with her mother and brother, who deputies refer to as her ‘boyfriend.' ”
In the video, one deputy gets inches from Silva's face and tells her to back up, away from Gonzalez's arrest. Silva backs up into a ditch, off the roadway, where she is then arrested.
Silva was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer, a felony, resisting with violence, a felony, and misdemeanor resisting without violence.
Deputy Garrick Plonczynski wrote that Silva kicked him while he was hauling her off to a van.
“Connie did knowingly and intentionally raise her right leg up and kick at my knee, striking my lower left knee, partially forcing my knee to buckle,” Plonczynski wrote.
The deputy wrote in his report that Silva was near the music, “where numerous Hispanics were observed just prior to the arrest taunting deputies while a song played at full volume and very loud with lyrics “F--- THE POLICE.”
Two views
Walter Zalisko, a retired police chief and undersheriff with more than 35 years of experience in law enforcement, said the Manatee Sheriff's gang unit could have used less confrontational tactics.
“I wouldn't say they were ‘provocative,' but they should have been a little more subtle in their video taping,” Zalisko said. “Walking down the middle of the street and zooming in on people would have been a lot better than putting a camera right in someone's face.
“That's antagonizing them,” he said. “If they put someone in plain clothes, an undercover officer, he'd fit right in. Their tactic was a little too in-your face.”
But Charles Miller Jr., president of the Rubonia Mardi Gras, said he had heard no specific complaints about the deputies' conduct from any of the estimated 15,000 attendees.
“There's just the normal complaint, that we have too many deputies on hand, but that's what the sheriff's department requires of us for a small area like that,” Miller said.
“As president, I don't have any complaints because I'd rather be safe than sorry.”

Two months after the soft launch of her presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton is ready for her big-stage re-entry as a candidate with a speech in New York laying out her vision for America and her rationale for running.
A biographical video released on Friday gave a taste of what to expect - a reminder of where she comes from and of her journey as a who has fought for children's rights and women's rights, and more generally someone with a middle-class background who, though she is now powerful and rich, can still champion the cause of the "everyday American".
But since her last video in April, when she announced she was running, her approval ratings have fallen and she's got company in the Democratic presidential field. She's also road-tested her campaign machine, however.
After a listening tour with dozens of small round-table events across the US and private fund-raisers, Mrs Clinton will hold a rally on New York's Roosevelt Island - a not-so-subtle shout-out to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the boldest of Democratic presidents, and the last time that Democrats held on to the White House for more than two terms, albeit in exceptional circumstances.

A Clinton election would be historic not only because she would be the first woman president of the United States, it would achieve the rare feat of keeping the White House within the same party for a third term. (Without endorsing any candidate, President Barack Obama has made clear he will do everything he can to help make that happen.)
But these are not the reasons she's running, though they would be the effect of a victory, said Ellen Tauscher. A seven-term Democratic member of Congress from California who went on to serve in Mrs Clinton's State Department, Tauscher is a strong Clinton supporter.
"Her speech is an opportunity to present the strategic vision for her candidacy, energising the millions who are already behind her, and pulling the base together behind her," Tauscher says. "As always, I hope that she can project the authentic Hillary and her commitment to serving all of the American people once she is elected."
Widely covered controversies over her use of a private email server while at the State Department and the possible conflict of interest from the flow of cash to the Clinton Foundation from foreign donors have led to a drop in Mrs Clinton's favourability ratings to below 50% - the lowest they've been since her 2008 presidential campaign. Her critics say she's so far failed to present a clear rationale for why she is running and appears like royalty awaiting coronation.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hillary Clinton has made round-table meetings with voters a focus of her early campaigning
Her speech is a chance to focus on the issues again and re-introduce herself to voters on the national stage after four decades in the public eye - as first lady of Arkansas, first lady of the United States, New York senator and secretary of state.
Only in the last role did she really emerge from the shadow of her husband, becoming more Hillary number 1 than Clinton number 2. This is the image she will project on stage on Saturday- her daughter Chelsea and husband Bill will appear alongside her, but she will be the only one to speak.
Unlike her husband, or Mr Obama, Mrs Clinton is not a natural, gifted orator and has always shied away from lofty speeches, preferring more down-to-earth, practical appeals based on a clear action plan.
Mrs Clinton will not lay out all the specifics of her policy in Saturday's speech, and she has yet to make decisions on the biggest policy questions, but she will follow up on key issues with more events throughout the summer.
A campaign aide told the BBC that Mrs Clinton spent the six months following the November midterm elections speaking to policy experts on a number of key issues, including college debt, equal pay and a crumbling infrastructure. Campaign aides fanned out to look into ideas and find policy solutions, delivering some 500 pages of memos for the former secretary of state to read.
After launching her campaign in April, Mrs Clinton heard the other side of the story - the voter's perspective - as she engaged in small round-table conversations in key early-voting states.
She was often pilloried in the media for the staged nature of the events, but the soft launch allowed her to set the pace of her public exposure while getting into the rhythm of the campaign, as her aides laid the foundation for the next year and half of campaigning, including a methodical focus on grass-root efforts across 50 states.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hillary Clinton may not get much of a primary challenge from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders
Over the last two months Mrs Clinton also set down policy markers on a number of domestic issues - such as immigration, crime and policing, voting rights and women equity pay - which have broad appeal but also target key demographics, such as Latinos, African-Americans and women.
One of Mrs Clinton's many challenges throughout the campaign, aside from the daunting task of raising more than $1bn (£640m), will be to keep the base energised through a primary season that could appear to most as a pro-forma process. Her closest competitor, socialist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, polls 50 points behind her.
"We need to think about how this primary affects the energy of the base and how we sustain the excitement," says Tracy Sefl, who was senior advisor to the Ready for Hillary super-PAC that ran a grass-root effort across the country last year urging Mrs Clinton to run. She remains close to the Clinton campaign.
"We're still 18 months away (from election day)," she adds. But lack of excitement can have an impact on voter turnout in the general election, with consequences as well for the House and Senate races.
Many in the Democratic Party would have preferred there be no challenger, to avoid the costly primary season and pool all the energy and resources into countering the Republican Party.
Another close aide said a sense of inevitability would only hurt her as a candidate, however, so Mrs Clinton has been prompt to welcome the entry of rivals into the Democratic race and has agreed to participate in the six primary debates set by the Democratic National Committee.
In a note her campaign manager Robby Mook sent out, he pointedly describes the field as "competitive" and points out that 72% of Democrats and independents believe that the party is best served by a "robust" primary season.
For now, her speech will need to be robust enough to fire up her supporters.
Every once in a while you'll hear of a drone causing trouble, either because it breached security perimeters or because someone though it'd be a great idea to strap a firearm to one in what might be the least smart thing to do since flying one over the White House walls.
But there's a bigger, more realistic, and all-too-regular issue: people are flying drones far too close to aircraft.
A trio of British companies have banded together to develop an anti-drone ray, which will soon be arriving at US airports, as part of the federal government's efforts to keep small, unmanned aircraft away from the larger, manned variety.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will soon begin trials of the ray, known as the Anti-UAV Defense System (AUDS), to detect and identify potentially dangerous or hostile drones in the near vicinity to airports.
The FAA didn't say which airports will receive the AUDS, but will study their use while ensuring that they're not getting in the way of existing airport security policies.
AUDS works by tracking the drone with a thermal imaging camera, then sending high-powered radio frequency signals to the drones, making them unresponsive to the controller.
In as little as eight seconds, the drone can be knocked from the skies of up to a range of about six miles.
The three British companies separately provide electronic-scanning radar target detection systems, electro-optic tracking and classification, radio-frequency disruption technologies to create the ray.
It can't come soon enough, given the rate of suspected drone sightings near US airports. According to the FAA, the administration receives more than 100 reports each month from pilots and others who spot unmanned drones flying too close to airplanes.
Homeland Security also last year warned that terrorists could use drones as weapons, but did not provide specifics on any imminent threat.

Testing the labor market. "Uber is not doing anything — it's only an application on our phones."
Facebook: uberdriversnetwork Facebook: uberdriversnetwork Uber drivers gathered outside of Uber's Long Island City offices on Monday to protest the low fares.
A group of Uber drivers, who say they number about a thousand, are attempting to organize a strike against the booming taxi company over complaints of falling fares and unfair working conditions. The drivers, who are mostly comprised of SUV and black car drivers, have planned a protest outside of the Long Island City Uber Office on Monday morning after refusing to drive for the service — and in some cases, switching to rival Lyft — Thursday, Friday and Saturday. This is the second protest the group, called Uber Drivers Network NYC, will be staging in a week against the company. One major grievance is that Uber has extended a summer discount into the fall, cutting deep into drivers wages and forcing them to work extra hours to compensate. Another complaint, according to an organizer and SUV driver who gave his name only as Belal, is that both SUV and black car drivers have been forced to accept requests for UberX — the non-luxury counterpart to Uber's black car service that charges a lower rate — if they are within the area. SUV and black car drivers never received UberX requests until earlier this summer when the company rolled out a program that allowed these premium car drivers to opt into being listed as both a black car and UberX service with the promise of a 35% to 50% increase in hourly income. According to Belal, he and many other drivers tried this option once or twice and realized they could not make as much as they did in the time they normally would work just being a black car driver exclusively and tried to email and text the company to opt out. But he and other drivers continue to receive UberX requests despite his attempts to return to just being a premium driver. Now drivers like Belal are not only awarded low rider acceptance rates they are also being temporarily suspended for only choosing to accept SUV or black car requests. "Uber is basically abusing the driver," Belal told BuzzFeed News. "They give us a 24 hour suspension and threaten that you will lose your chance with Uber. To get a ride for $8.00, I'll have to work the whole day. Gas and insurance for SUV's are expensive. I have to pay $80 to $100 a day in gas."
Facebook: Uber Drivers Network NYC / Via facebook.com A text message one Uber driver posted to the group's Facebook page.
Belal said many of the drivers attempted to work with the company once the option to deny UberX requests was no longer available. But since the company reduced the fare this past July in an attempt to offer a ride cheaper than a yellow cab the demand for UberX rides has been much higher, Belal said. "They make us work for UberX permanently because we received tons of UberX calls per minute," he said. "This means we never get the chance to accept black car or SUV cars. We can only pick UberX. It's a strategy for them to put us to work only for UberX." Belal and his fellow organizers — one of whose meet up spot of choice is the Lahore Deli on Crosby St. — attempted to organize other disgruntled Uber drivers on Uber Drivers Network NYC's Facebook page and asked them to go on strike today, Friday and Saturday by not accepting any of the requests — UberX or otherwise — or simply turning their phones off. Drivers have also been posting information about the strike on Uber's official Facebook page; another organizer, UberX driver Masood Rehman, said the company has quickly been deleting the posts. With no previous experience in activism or dealing with the media, this group of Uber drivers are struggling to reach both news organizations and other Uber drivers with their message. According to posts on the group's Facebook page, some drivers have resorted to printing out fliers and distributing them to SUVs with TLC licenses.
Experts think teens 'don't have enough time' to engage in 'risky
Teenagers born after 2000 - the so-called 'Generation Z' - are the most socially conservative generation since the Second World War, a new study has found.
The youngsters surveyed had more conservative views on gay marriage, transgender rights and drugs than Baby Boomers, Generation X or Millennials.
The questioned were more prudent than Millennials, Generation X and Baby Boomers but not quite as cash-savvy as those born in 1945 or before.
Scroll down for video
As well as being more socially conservative, more than 10 per cent of teenagers is more likely to avoid tattoos
Sociology experts class those born in or before 1945 as the Silent Generation; people born between 1946 and 1964 as Baby Boomers; those born between 1965 and 1980 as Generation X; and anyone born between 1980 and 2000 as Millennials.
Only 14 and 15-year-olds were surveyed, by brand consultancy The Gild, as they were classed as being able to form credible opinions by that age.
When asked to comment on same-sex marriage, transgender rights and cannabis legislation, 59 per cent of Generation X teenagers said they had conservative views.
Around 85 per cent of Millennials and those in Generation X had a 'quite' or 'very liberal' stance overall.
When asked for their specific view on each topic only the Silent Generation was more conservative that Generation Z.
One in seven - 14% - of the 14 and 15-year-olds took a 'quite conservative' approach, while only two per cent of Millennials and one per cent of Generation X.
The Silent Generation had a 'quite conservative' rating of 34 per cent.
Young people, who have grown up during the 2008 financial crash, were also more prudent and careful with their finances. A quarter of respondents wanted to save money instead of spending cash they didn't have.
The youngsters surveyed had more conservative views on gay marriage, transgender rights and drugs than their older siblings, parents and potentially even grandparents
Baby Boomers took a difference approach and said that 'money is made to be spent'.
Again only the prewar generation came ahead of today's teenagers for holding an even more shrewd financial head.
As well as being more socially conservative, more than 10 per cent of teenagers is more likely to avoid tattoos.
This compared to only two per cent of Millennials and six per cent of Generation X.
The research, which surveyed more than 2,000 people, forms parallels with recent evidence that young people are less likely to drink and take drugs than their immediate elders.
Sir Mark Walport, the government's chief scientific adviser, told The Times that technology had had a huge effect on society and teenager's values.
Scientists for Labour members have voted overwhelmingly to endorse Owen Smith in the Labour leadership election. Our members voted to back Owen to be the next leader over Jeremy Corbyn by a margin of five to two, with three-quarters taking part in the ballot.
I believe the landslide result was due to disappointment with Corbyn's leadership, deep unhappiness over the EU referendum result, and an excitement that a credible alternative is being offered by Smith.
Jeremy's leadership has disappointed many of us. He has talked about boosting investment in our economy and supporting science. But a year on from becoming leader, he has not progressed beyond this to develop any detail, and his response to the questions that Scientists for Labour posed were broad and vague. We were disappointed that Jeremy did not appoint a full-time shadow minister for science as he had promised. It is deeply frustrating that there is currently no shadow minister covering science at all. Under Jeremy, Labour has failed to take on the Tories for their failures on science; we have not been the united and strong opposition that our country needs.
Our membership of the EU is hugely beneficial to UK science, so we are absolutely devastated by what happened with the EU referendum. We are a major beneficiary of EU funding, and science in the UK has benefited from free movement, from the single market, and from the framework the EU provides for international collaboration. Jeremy conspicuously failed to make a clear and enthusiastic Labour case for remaining in the EU. His campaign was lacklustre and his heart just didn't seem to be in it.
I welcome Owen's position on the EU. He understands that Brexit poses a profound threat to investment and collaboration in the science community, and to our wider economy. The British people were lied to during the referendum, the result was very close, and the final deal will not be what we were promised. Therefore I too think it is right that British voters are given a say on the proposed deal, through either another referendum or a general election.
Along with other members, I have been impressed by Owen Smith's campaign. His responses to our questions were convincing and substantial. He clearly understands that science isn't just important in itself, it is absolutely crucial to building a modern, dynamic and productive economy with good quality jobs.
Owen recognises that the UK has failed to invest enough in R&D and we need to reverse the decline of our manufacturing strength. He understands the scale of the threat from climate change, and he has a valid plan to address it. He also sees the potential for new jobs in green technology. Owen has pledged to introduce a British New Deal, with £200bn of investment, including £40bn for the new industries of the future and £15bn for the Green Investment Bank. Owen has promised to introduce a dedicated minister for science to coordinate action across government, something that is very welcome indeed.
With ballots going out this week, I will be voting for Owen Smith. I believe he understands that the importance of science, and he has a radical and credible plan to transform our economy. I believe he will be the best person to unite our country and take on the Tories.
Technology pervades every corner of our lives, and with it comes political and social challenge. To understand its benefits and flaws there is a need to put scientific expertise and evidence-based policy making at the heart of politics in the Labour Party and government. We need to set out a positive and forward-thinking vision for our country. I believe Owen is the leader who can do that.
John Unsworth is chair of Scientists for Labour, a socialist society established over 20 years ago and affiliated to Labour. Members are dispersed across the UK and come with a wide range of scientific and engineering experiences encompassing most disciplines from academic research, development, teaching, technical and industry backgrounds.
Father Bob staying until 2012
Updated
Father Bob Maguire will continue on as parish priest at South Melbourne until February 2012 after reaching a compromise agreement with the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Denis Hart.
Father Bob, as he is widely known, has told AAP he will hand over the financial side of running the parish in return for staying on past his 75th birthday, which he celebrated earlier this month.
Under canon law, priests have to tender their resignation when they reach 75.
"We've signed an agreement where [Archbishop Hart] runs the place, and that's all right according to my suits," Father Bob said, referring to his lawyer.
With his lawyer by his side, Father Bob thanked the media and spoke of his victory in military terms.
"I'm an old digger and I salute the Archbishop as a senior officer, and he acknowledges my competence as the unit commander," he said.
Archbishop Hart agreed it was a good outcome.
"It's a win-win; Bob is going to do well what he does until he retires on the first of February 2012," he said.
A lawyer had hammered out the compromise after Father Bob refused to resign and garnered huge support from the Australian public.
"I'm just glad that I'm still the parish priest and South Melbourne can continue our work as another face of Catholicism," he said.
"I've agreed to resign in February 2012 but whether the public will want that, I don't know."
Archbishop Hart had accused Father Bob of financial mismanagement by selling off church property to fund his charities.
But Father Bob countered by saying the archbishop had to give final approval for any sale.
"I'll have to find money from other sources to make sure disadvantaged people don't suffer," Father Bob said.
The priest, who has headed the South Melbourne parish for 36 years, is well known for his charities and helping feed the homeless in the inner city district.
He appears on triple j's weekly radio program Sunday Night Safran alongside John Safran.

, stirring more sports into its live-video stew, will be the exclusive home to 47 college basketball games for the 2017-18 season, which it will stream for free. A lot of the matchups, though, are between teams that aren't coveted by national TV sports networks.
Facebook struck the deal with sports-media venture Stadium, which will distribute the games on Facebook, featuring matchups from conferences including Mountain West, West Coast Conference, Conference USA, and the Atlantic 10. The games are available globally via the Live: Stadium College Basketball show page, but only people in the U.S. will be able to watch them within Facebook's Watch tab (as Watch is only available in the U.S.).
To tailor the broadcasts for Facebook, Stadium's on-air talent team will address fan comments and questions throughout the live games, among other coordinated production assets and social elements. Stadium has already broadcast two games (Vanderbilt vs. Belmont on Nov. 13 and Florida A&M vs. UNLV on Nov. 11). The games will be available to watch on-demand after the broadcasts.
In addition, Stadium will produce an exclusive weekly live studio show dedicated to college basketball, with highlights, social video and photos, commentary and analysis. The 30-minute show will air on the Live: Stadium College Basketball page every Wednesday evening beginning Nov. 29 at 6:30 p.m. ET, hosted by Stadium's Dave Ross with basketball analyst Tim Doyle.
Chicago-based Stadium is a joint venture owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, MLB Advanced Media, the NHL, the PGA TOUR, Time Inc. and Silver Chalice.
The schedule of games includes several teams that competed in the 2017 NCAA March Madness Tournament, including Dayton, Saint Mary's, Middle Tennessee State, Nevada, Florida Gulf Coast, Wake Forest, Rhode Island, U.C. Davis, VCU, Minnesota and New Mexico State. It also includes teams from schools such as Pittsburgh, UNLV, Utah, Washington State, Ole Miss, Memphis, George Washington, and UMass.
The deal comes on the heels of Stadium's pact with Facebook to exclusively live-stream 15 college football games this season, similarly from smaller schools.
In addition to the Facebook-only games, Stadium will stream additional college basketball games across platforms including WatchStadium.com, the Stadium iOS and tvOS apps, Stadium Android app, Twitter (at @WatchStadium) and on Pluto TV.

I know seven years in the news business might as well be several decades, so I'm going to treat the following as such because Sean Hannity obviously doesn't remember his or his flagship network's recent past to see any irony in tweeting something like this:
Here is what he was saying ‘Amen' to:
But, in October 2009, it was Fox News reporters who were getting the shaft by the White House and the administration in general.
And why? Because the White House took issue with Fox News commentators, like Sean Hannity and former Fox News personality, Glenn Beck, for going after members of their administration, namely then-White House Adviser Van Jones and “School Czar” Kevin Jennings.
Things got so contentious that Fox News's former Chairman and CEO, Roger Ailes, met with White House Adviser David Axelrod in September 2009 to try and work things out, after “Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace” was skipped during the rounds of Sunday morning talk shows. Ailes attempted to explain to Axelrod that the White House was conflating straight reporters with commentators. Axelrod and the White House maintained that Fox News was acting more like right-wing talk radio and “not a news network.”
President Obama even took the opportunity to weigh in on the matter on NBC News in mid-October, saying “What our advisers have simply said is that we are going to take media as it comes. And if media is operating, basically, as a talk radio format, then that's one thing. And if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another.”
A showdown was inevitable. And in mid-October, one of the greatest stands by the media in recent history happened over a press pool ban of Fox News with the Treasury department's “Pay Czar” Kenneth Feinberg.
Remember this, Sean? From Fox News:
The Treasury Department on Thursday tried to make “pay czar” Kenneth Feinberg available for interviews to every member of the network pool except Fox News. The pool is the five-network rotation that for decades has shared the costs and duties of daily coverage of the presidency and other Washington institutions. But the Washington bureau chiefs of the five TV networks consulted and decided that none of their reporters would interview Feinberg unless Fox News was included. The pool informed Treasury that Fox News, as a member of the network pool, could not be excluded from such interviews under the rules of the pool. The administration relented, making Feinberg available for all five pool members and Bloomberg TV.
Fox News's own legal analyst, Peter Johnson Jr., declared the attempt as a “constitutional violation.”
Johnson defined the press pool as “the eyes and ears of America” and said, “the pool has been certified in the courts in Washington and around the country as part of the public debate.” He also agreed that keeping certain news organizations out just because you don't like what some of their employees do is a clear violation of the freedom of the press.
So which is it, Sean? A constitutional violation or something we should say “amen” to.
I know you probably don't care much for the actual news side of the station that has been your enabler for over a decade because it's a post-facts world and all. But the reality is that in supporting a ban on certain news organizations, just because you don't like what some of their employees do, has turned you into that which you purported to despise a scant seven years ago.
Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas promises to rescue the holiday from those whose “bad case of religious bah humbugs” has driven them to eradicate all nativity scenes and replace “Merry Christmas” with godless niceties. But Christmas may never make it now, thanks to another, equally credible threat: As Cameron explains in this newest trailer, the film was recently hit by “an anti-Christian group out of Turkey, of all places, who hijacked our website and replaced our trailer with some hate-filled propaganda and promises to destroy… well, everything that Christmas is all about.” Indeed, they promise to unleash a bah humbug so great, it could annihilate the very world. And the world is where Christmas happens.
As first reported by Glenn Beck's The Blaze—easily the Variety of whatever Kirk Cameron is doing—the Saving Christmas website was taken over by Ayyildiz Tim International Force, a group that has also hacked pages run by the United Nations, before turning its attention to those who are really making a difference. The site was reportedly replaced with a banner image of a man in armor—believed to be the Muslim sultan Saladin, who fought Christian crusaders in 788 to 793 B.C. (Before Cameron)—along with Turkish text reading, “The Turkish spirit will shine again and the use of weapons will emerge in the nation's history as this hero will shine again.” It's also believed that Saladin will not attend Kirk Cameron's Christmas party.

After hearing “music and a loud gunshot,” visitors were automatically redirected to the Ayyildiz Tim Twitter page, where the group regularly brags of all the other, equally important enemies of Islam it's waged its holy hacker war upon. These include Kirk Cameron's fellow soldiers proudly fighting for their own beliefs, such as YoungFashionTrends.de, AllNaturalExtract.com, AlphaMaxTestosteroneBooster.com, and of course, Bike-Rack-For-Car.com. Oddly enough, the Ayyildiz Tim Twitter account doesn't actually boast about hacking Cameron's website itself—and in fact, it only retweets The Blaze's story about the hacking.
Nevertheless, much like the time that Facebook “blocked” the trailer for Kirk Cameron's Unstoppable—creating a conveniently timed narrative of persecution that played into the idea of Christian victimization, which creates the audience for films like Saving Christmas in the first place—this is all definitely no coincidence.

“Coincidence?” Cameron asks. “Or does it actually prove the title of the movie? Will you and your family join me and my family this year in putting ‘Christ' back in Christmas?” And if not, will there even be a Christmas—or a “your family”? It's a question that Kirk Cameron hopes you ask yourself, before it's too late (i.e. November 14).

ESL disqualified Astral Authority from the Fall Regional #1 Qualifer #3 for the Los Angeles Championship after a Reddit post showed evidence of a Astral Authority player exploiting a bug with Tyrael, Archangel of Justice in a Qualifier match against Chu8 my Hotdoge.
"ESL, in collaboration with Blizzard Entertainment has reviewed replays of Astral Authority's matches as well as other matches involving Tyrael from today's Heroes Fall Regional #1 Qualifier #3," said ESL product manager Chris Negrin in a statement. "After review, it was determined that a player on Astral Authority exploited a bug with Tyrael. There is enough evidence to show this was not an isolated incident and that the intent was to abuse a specific set of commands in order to gain an unfair advantage."
"ESL's ruling is as follows: Astral Authority is disqualified from the Fall Regional #1 Qualifier #3 due to breaking ESL Rule 1.10 and 5.6. They will be replaced by the match winner of Imported Support and Chu 8."
I think this is a little more than what it should be doing. If that's not purposely abusing a bug... pic.twitter.com/uSYUzjRRJE — Ben Hosford (@Hosselote) July 25, 2016
The bug involved uses the Talent "Even in Death" with the ability "Archangel's Wrath." Even in Death increases the damage of Archangel's Wrath's explosion and allows basic abilities to be used before death, but they aren't supposed to deal damage. The intent of the talent is to allow Tyrael to gain the utility benefits of his basic abilities before the explosion, but there's a window where Tyrael's damage abilities are working just before the explosion allowing him to do unintended damage.
Astral Authority's CEO, COO, coach Kristine "Vaalia" Hutter and manager Mellina "Mel" Kong have all tweeted against the ruling, Vaalia claiming the players "had no idea" about the bug but that it is "accepted" in Korea and the EU.
Looks like a perfectly accepted bug in Korea and EU, that @AstralAuthority had no idea about, is now worth a disqualification. Disappointed. — Kristine Hutter (@Vaalia_) July 25, 2016
Nothing hurts more as a manager than seeing your players practice and work hard everyday, and have their dreams crushed. Fucking hurts. — AutumnDreamwhisper ♡ (@MellinaKong) July 25, 2016
The best-of-three match for Astral Authority's slot between Chu 8 and Imported Support has yet to be announced.

Gold imports may hit all-time high of 1,000 tonnes in 2015
India's gold imports may hit an all-time high of over 1,000 tonnes in 2015 buoyed by sharp fall in global prices, according to the India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation.
The world's second-biggest gold consumer had imported around 900 tonnes in 2014, it said.
"For the first time, we expect gold imports to cross 1,000 tonnes this calendar year. More imports are being undertaken taking advantage of significant fall in global prices," federation director Bachhraj Bamalwa said.
Gold prices in the international market have fallen to a five-year low. However, the fall in global prices has not reflected in the domestic market due to rupee appreciation against the US dollar, he said.
According to the federation, India has imported 850 tonnes of gold during January-September period of 2015 as against 650 tonnes in the year-ago period.
"We expect 150-200 tonnes of imports to take place in the December quarter of this year, as against 300 tonnes in the year-ago period," Bamalwa said.
Imports in the October-December period this year is likely to be lower compared to the year-ago period because traders imported more during last year fearing further restrictions on gold shipments, he added.
In the latest report, the World Gold Council has said India's gold demand in fourth (October - December) quarter would be more muted.
"Lingering concerns over the health of the rural Indian economy and local gold prices remaining in close proximity to Rs27,000 per 10 grams level in recent weeks also give reasons to adopt a prudent outlook for the usual fourth quarter uplift in Indian demand", it said.
Although the upsurge in demand during July-September period partially compensated for the second quarter's poor turnout, it also ate into normal seasonal demand that would take place between September and November, the report said.
Festival and wedding purchases were brought forward to take advantage of the price dip, therefore demand towards the end of the year is likely to be correspondingly affected, it added.
Gold is the second-largest import item for India after petroleum. Higher gold import bill adversely affects the country's current account deficit.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has set the stage for a major vote Monday morning at 1:00 AM – one that would require the support of 60 Senators. That would, if all goes according to Senator Reid's plan, set up a late-night Christmas Eve vote on final passage. Senator Reid also used a rare procedure to block any further amendments from being offered, debated or voted upon.
When it comes time for Senators to cast their vote at 1:00AM Monday morning, shortly after Sunday Night Football ends and most Americans are in bed, they will have had less than 38 hours to understand a 383-page amendment that introduces several new concepts into the health care debate, including:
A scheme that gives the Office of Personal Management immense power in administering what amounts to a multi-state public plan;
How much a state “opt-out” of abortion coverage in the legislation erodes the long-standing Hyde-amendment;
The budgetary impact of ELIMINATING the physician reimbursement fix; and,
Multiple new taxes, federal regulations and sweet-heart deals aimed toward certain states like Nebraska.
It is important for Americans to understand the process being used by the Senate. Barring any procedural snags (of which there are many in the Senate's complex rules and precedents), the debate is likely to play out as follows:
Monday, 1:00 AM – Vote to invoke cloture (i.e. end debate) on the manager's amendment. 60 votes are necessary.
Tuesday, 7:00 AM – Vote to approve the manager's amendment. A majority vote is necessary.
Tuesday, 8:00 AM – Vote to invoke cloture on the original Reid substitute amendment (the 2,000-page bill). 60 votes are necessary.
Wednesday, 2:00 PM – Vote to approve the Reid substitute amendment. A majority vote is necessary.
Wednesday, 3:00 PM – Vote to invoke cloture on the underlying bill. 60 votes are necessary.
Thursday, 9:00 PM – Vote to approve the underlying bill (i.e. the Senate's version of Obamacare). A majority vote is necessary.
Last January, President Obama told his senior staff that “transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.” Now, an unconstitutional health care proposal that was drafted behind closed doors and poised to be approved while Americans are not looking will become the touchstone of his presidency. Surely this was not what the American people signed up for.
Newt Gingrich said Monday that President-elect Donald Trump could simply pardon members of his administration who may break anti-nepotism laws, adding that Trump's business ties require “a whole new approach” to addressing potential conflicts of interest in the presidency.
“In the case of the president, he has a broad ability to organize the White House the way he wants to. He also has, frankly, the power of the pardon,” Gingrich told WAMU's Diane Rehm on Monday morning. “It is a totally open power, and he could simply say, ‘Look, I want them to be my advisers. I pardon them if anyone finds them to have behaved against the rules. Period.' Technically, under the Constitution, he has that level of authority.”
Gingrich was referring to a federal anti-nepotism law that could prevent Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, Trump's daughter and son-in-law, respectively, from serving in his administration. Previously, Gingrich suggested Trump may need a waiver from Congress to have Kushner work in his administration.
On Monday, however, Gingrich said the law was the result of “Lyndon Johnson's reaction to Bobby Kennedy, and the fact that Johnson hated Kennedy.”
“It was a very narrowly focused bill really in reaction to a particular personality thing,” he said. “I think that we have to look at it in the context of what they were trying to accomplish.”
Although Gingrich acknowledged that Trump's potential conflicts of interest were “a very real problem,” he argued that the President-elect's massive wealth was “virtually impossible to isolate” and that “traditional rules don't work.”
“We're going to have to think up a whole new approach,” he said.
For his part, Gingrich provided little detail as to what that approach might look like. He suggested a “review group,” led by someone like former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, could “monitor regularly what was going on and would offer warnings if they get too close to the edge.”
“You can't say that Trump Tower is not the Trump Tower or that Trump Hotel is not the Trump Hotel, and you can't say that the kids who run it isn't his children,” Gingrich said. “These are facts and they're obvious.”
After returning from a commercial break, Rehm asked Richard Painter, President George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, for his reaction to Gingrich's comments.
“There is no billionaire exception in the Constitution of the United States,” Painter said, adding later: “The pardon power can not be used by the president to pardon himself, or to cause other members of his administration to engage in illegal conduct or unconstitutional conduct and then simply use the pardon power in that way. If the pardon power allows that, the pardon power allows the president to become a dictator.”

A FLIGHT to Morocco from a UK airport had to be evacuated by police seconds before takeoff.
GETTY THREAT: The plane was evacuated after a man said there was a bomb aboard
“The searches and security checks are on-going and no explosive devices have so far been found.” Greater Manchester Police Greater Manchester Police say officers were called at about 3.30pm after reports a passenger said there was bomb in his bag. They then arrested two men, aged 45 and 46, on suspicion of making the suspected bomb hoax. A police spokesman said confirmed that passengers and their baggage were now being subjected to another security screening before they were allowed back on the plane.
GETTY ALARM: Passengers were evacuated amid security fears
EasyJet say passengers on its 3.35pm flight to Marrakech were taken off the aircraft at Manchester airport to allow for "security checks". It comes after passenger made a hoax bomb threat as a JOKE – forcing terrified pilots to make an emergency landing.

We're back with the conclusion of our discussion about how Call of Cthulhu 7th edition came about. Once again, we're joined by Mike Mason, line editor of Call of Cthulhu, who co-authored 7th edition along with our very own Paul Fricker. I'm saying “once again” like we met up again to continue the discussion, but this is really the continuation of the long chat that started in episode 78. We cut it in half because no one in their right mind wants to listen to us natter on for two and a half hours non-stop.
And again, we should warn you that we recorded these episodes in May of 2015, when our recording equipment was more primitive. At this time, we believed that the printing of 7th edition was imminent, so please try not to judge too harshly if you hear us getting that wrong. Our decision to hold off releasing these episodes until the books were with backers has meant that they have been languishing on Paul's computer for a year, and we're happy to finally get the chance to release them. We're even happier that the books are now in backers' hands, and will soon be available for retail.
We have a number of new Patreon backers to thank, but with these being old recordings, we shan't be able to do so until next episode. On the bright side, we will be singing at least twice next time. There may even be percussion, if Paul can work out how to make use of our ill-advised experiments with dice-stuffed improvised maracas.

So, a lot of people have been wondering about the Demise Kozmo deck that I just made Top16 with at YCS Providence. Before this event, the only decks that played the card were Qliphorts, Gravekeepers, and Statue Stun. Unfortunately, all of those decks suck. The difference between those decks and Kozmo is that Kozmo actually has a lot of power on both players' turns, and has a much better/relevant engine. It does not NEED to draw Card of Demise for it to function. It is also correct to say that no one would even play the other decks without Card of Demise because of how outclassed they are on an engine-vs-engine basis. In this article, I am going to explain the ins and outs of Card of Demise while also sharing some of my recent tournament experience.
I will start by saying that I tested with the Fire King Kozmo deck extensively before YCS Providence, and while it was really cool and explosive, it had some huge flaws that I could not get around. For one, those combos are not necessary to win the game. You will win every game that you open with Tincan and three backrows going first just as much as you will win with those ridiculous fields of Infinity, Dark Lady, Tincan, etc. What was frustrating for me was when I would still lose against Monarchs after opening with the combos. I felt that the whole point of playing the Fire King build was to have a better matchup, but it just does not work out that way. Sure, Fire King Island added a new way for Kozmos to win, but it also added new ways for it to lose. You can draw “the chicken”, which is typically useless, or you can draw a hand with pilots and field spells. The combos are also very fragile, so any form of disruption will make you stop and run into your deck for a Tincan. Unfortunately, because of the high monster and spell card counts, you do not have much room for traps. A Tincan without traps is very easy to deal with and will usually lose you the game. I also found that the Fire King Build just loses to standard Kozmos playing trap cards, so I literally did not see a reason to play that build.
At this time, I would like to give a special shoutout to my good friend and deck-building mastermind, Sean McCabe, for cooking up this list:
Monsters: 16
3 Kozmo Farmgirl
3 Kozmo Dark Destroyer
3 Kozmo Tincan
2 Kozmo Dark Lady
2 Kozmo Sliprider*
1 Kozmo Strawman
1 Kozmo Landwalker
1 Kozmo Forerunner
Spells: 9
3 Card of Demise
3 Kozmotown
2 Emergency Teleport
1 Upstart Goblin
Traps: 15
3 Kozmojo
3 Solemn Strikes
3 Call of the Haunted
2 Oases of Dragon Souls
2 Chaos Trap Hole
1 Solemn Warning
1 Vanity's Emptiness
Side Deck: 15
3 Chaos Hunter
3 Maxx “C”
3 Masks of Restrict
2 Twin Twister
2 Anti-Spell Fragrance
1 Raigeki
1 Dark Hole
*Sean played three copies of Sliprider instead of using Landwalker because he had never tested with it, and did not want to chance it being awful.
The basic idea here is a low monster count and a much higher spell/trap count so that the deck does not conflict with Demise. Extra monsters can be returned to the deck with Kozmotown so that you get the most value from Card of Demise. At worst, the card is a Tincan that fills your graveyard with monsters so that your multiple copies of Call/Oasis are always live. At best, it is an auto-win from you drawing 2-3 extra traps.
Something important to note is that you can resolve the effect of Card of Demise on the end phase before you activate the effect of Kozmo Tincan. This means that you will get to keep the card that Tincan gives to you, regardless of the discarding effect of Demise. You must state that you are resolving the effect of Card of Demise in the end phase first if you want to avoid any confusion.
As far as meta calls go, I noticed that in the past few months, the community has underestimated the power of trap cards. The lack of traps has given rise to Monarchs. I could not figure out why Monarchs used to be considered so bad before, and now all of a sudden they are considered the deck to beat. I thought about my few matches against the deck during the full powered Pepe format, and I recalled that having anything to stop their summon would pretty much end the game. Chaos Trap Hole hits every relevant monster in the deck. It also makes it where the graveyard effects of Erebus and Edea won't resolve. In my opinion, it is one of the best cards in the game right now because it hurts every good deck. I would consider playing three copies of it, but I feel that Strike is a little more useful because it negates Kozmo pilots' effect to tag out, and it stops your monsters from being tributed by Stormforth with Ehther on your turn. Going second with Chaos Trap Hole is actually good against Monarchs, too, because it will just end their next turn. Either way, they will be skipping a turn and losing a resource.
Instead of regular traps, everyone has been using hand traps. Hand traps suck against decks that use regular traps. Demise Kozmo is pretty much immune to cards like Maxx “C” and Effect Veiler because you won't be able to capitalize on stopping my plays since all of the traps are so powerful. You Maxx “C” the deck and I will get Tincan or Dark Lady and set three. It's cool that you got an Upstart Goblin, but don't expect too much else. Also, with three Farmgirls it is very likely that I will just kill you anyway.
The high trap count makes this deck play a lot like stun. This is why there are three copies of Kozmo Farmgirl. She is the best pilot to an open field. She is also the most threatening. When you end your opponent's turn with one of the six counter traps, you can drop Farmgirl to quickly take the game or make it where he/she cannot come back. I also enjoyed that several of my opponents in Providence would see one or two Farmgirls banished, and would decide to use The Prime Monarch to block Dark Destroyer from attacking directly. This of course led to me catching them with nasty Teleport and Call of the Haunted plays. In this way, Farmgirl stole many games on my trip to a 9-1 swiss record.
I always found it strange how broken Call of the Haunted and Oasis of Dragon Souls are in Kozmo. They are basically combo cards, and virtually immune to Twin Twister. But perhaps the nastiest thing that you can do with them on your opponent's turn is chain them to the effect of The Heavenly Squire, targeting Kozmo Dark Lady. Since the effect of Eidos is mandatory, you can use Dark Lady to negate it and end the Monarch player's turn. I used this trick to beat ARG Atlantic City Champion, Ryan Levine in swiss. Be mindful that this only works if The Heavenly Squire was his/her normal summon for the turn.
Another cool thing you can do with Call and Oasis is use them to save your Tincan from dying. I usually bring back Landwalker during the battle phase to put my opponent in an awkward situation. If he continues to attack, the Tincans will multiply when Landwalker destroys itself instead. If that happens, it's over. The scariest thing that can happen, though, is getting rid of Kozmotown to search for whatever I need at the time, which is usually Kozmojo or Dark Destroyer. I still find it ridiculous that Landwalker can destroy Kozmotown to save your monsters from dying. In fact, I played a mirror match at Providence where my opponent used Raigeki on my field and I simply chained Oasis to bring back Landwalker, then destroyed Kozmotown to search Dark Destroyer instead of having my three monsters die. He intended to get rid of my double Dark Lady, and all he got was more problems for his troubles. Landwalker is a continuous effect, so this is a completely legal play.
Moving on to the side deck, the only interesting thing to note is Chaos Hunter. She is absolutely broken in the mirror and not many people seemed to be aware of that. She acts as a hand trap, but unlike the conventional ones she actually summons herself and has a big body. She destroys the Fire King build of Kozmo because that deck does not play any traps outside of Call of the Haunted and Kozmojo, and it cannot perform its combo with her on the field. The good thing is, everyone was playing the Fire King build. Chaos Hunter says your opponent cannot banish cards, but you can banish cards all you like. This means you can still tag out your pilots for ships, and you can use Kozmojo to remove whatever you don't like. Discarding a card can be a good thing when you have things like Call of the Haunted and Oasis set, so she combos with them perfectly for blowout plays. Discard a Dark Destroyer and bring it back to destroy a monster, or target itself to bring out Farmgirl. You can also use Call and Oasis to bring back Chaos Hunter when your opponent plays cards like System Down. It will simply resolve without effect. Alternatively, you can chain Call or Oasis to Kozmojo for a true blowout since Chaos Hunter will come back and prevent any of your cards from being banished, while also costing your opponent two cards (Kozmojo and whatever he/she targeted for destruction).
Back to the point of this whole deck: Card of Demise. I think that what people don't understand is how traps simplify the game. They tend to take cards from both players. Normally, this is not the best thing to do, but when you are maxing out on a card that says draw three then we must reevaluate. A midgame Card of Demise is usually enough to give you the win. It is the only card that can allow you to comeback from a devastating Monarch play. Under normal circumstances, you cannot draw out of a situation when you have no cards. And needless to say, it is very good on turn one as well because it tends to be an auto-win. There are some games where you don't activate it on turn one because your hand calls for a different play, and then you just use it on the following turn for the blowout. Kozmo does not need to special summon on its own turn in order to win, and that's what's great about Card of Demise in this deck.
I recommend trying the deck out, seeing what you like and what you don't like, and then making changes. The list could always be better given new knowledge. I hope you enjoyed reading this.
Until next time, duelists! Remember, Play Hard or Go Home!

It's kind of funny when a publicist for Insane Clown Posse gets nervous about them being interviewed by VICE because they're worried about their clients being made fools of. But you can't really blame them. Insane Clown Posse has been a punchline ever since the duo was hoofing it out in the bowels of the Detroit underground way back in the early ‘90s. Today, several gold and platinum albums later, they proudly call themselves "The Most Hated Band In the World," but make no mistake — ICP may be the most loathed rappers in history but these guys built a veritable entertainment empire without any mainstream support or radio airplay. It's a rap-to-riches story that Horatio Alger would have loved … if he didn't mind being splattered with Faygo brand cola.
VICE caught up with ICP co-founder Shaggy 2 Dope to discuss their forthcoming album The Mighty Death Pop! which comes out this summer.
VICE:So tell me about The Mighty Death Pop. What is his role in the Dark Carnival?
Shaggy 2 Dope: Well, this is the second hand of Joker's Cards and the Death Pop is like about how you want to live your life. You never know when he's just gonna pop up and fuck up your shit. You know what I'm sayin'? You could be smokin' weed or drinking and all of a sudden—BAM!—he's there. So you gotta slow down a little bit and enjoy life because you never know when he'll be there in your face.
Tell me about this new song "Chris Benoit." I listened to it last night and it's creepy as hell. What inspired you to write a song about the Benoit murder-suicide?
It's actually not about Chris Benoit at all. We just use his name as a reference because the song is about just snapping and going crazy and out of control. You know what I'm sayin'? ‘Cause that's what (Benoit) did. That's one of our favorites from the new album. We've been working on Death Pop for over two years and it was really cool doing it because we didn't have any deadlines, so we were able to put all of our heart and energy into each song and then go back and retweak it until it was perfect. We put our heart and soul into that record and I don't wanna say it's the best thing we've ever come out with, but we always think the new one is the best one. You know what I'm sayin'?
On one of the bonus discs for this album, you recorded a cover of "Beautiful" by Christina Aguilera? Wow.
Yeah, with that album (Covered, Smothered, and Chunked) we wanted to do shit that no one expected ICP to ever do. So we got shit on there from Christina Aguilera, Tears for Fears (“Shout”), Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger (“State of Shock”), the Geto Boys (“Mind Playin' Tricks On Me”). It was just about us doing crazy shit that would make everybody go “What the fuck?!” You know what I'm sayin'?
You also do a version of Too $hort's classic song "Freaky Tales," but your version clocks in at 64-minutes. Was the final version recorded in one take?
No, no, it took us many, many, many days to do that. For each 16-hour session, we'd try to get like three minutes worth of the song out of it. We'd be working on all these other tracks and so we could only work on “Freaky Tales” a little bit at a time. It took us a while to do that record because it wasn't recorded like a normal song. Each day we'd have to pick where we'd been the day before and it was a really long process. Wasn't easy. Far from one take.
Last year you recorded a Mozart composition called "Leck Mich Im Arsch" (Lick Me In the Ass) with Jack White. How did that come about? A lot of people heard that and were like “What the eff?!”
That was the plan. Jack approached us and of course, we were flattered, but that's the response he was looking for—to make people go “What the fuck is going on here?” You know what I'm sayin'? But it was a really cool experience though, because we didn't know what the fuck we were doing or what we were walking into. We went down to his studio in Nashville and it was a real old school recording, all reel-to-reel tapes and shit. It made us feel like we were back in the early ‘90s. Very déjà vu. But we thought Jack was the shit for inviting us to do it because we totally thought “He's probably gonna lose some fans over this.” But it was just us having a good time together. You know what I'm sayin'?
Over the years you've used gay slurs in your lyrics. For the record, do you have a problem with gay people?
Oh, absolutely not, man. It's all about context and what you really mean. Take TV, for example. You can say the word “dick” or “asshole” but only if you're calling someone an “asshole” or a “dick.” It's the same thing with the word “fag.” When we say it, it's the same way as calling someone as “asshole” or a “fuckhead.” You know what I'm sayin'? But it's not trying to slam gay people. I know plenty of gay people and they're cool as hell, and I've got no problem with gay people at all. Hating gay people is like being racist — it just doesn't make any sense.
Juggalos may be the most hated fanbase in the history of music. The FBI now considers them a gang on the same level as Bloods and Crips. What is the biggest misconception about Juggalos?
Ah shit, man, being a Juggalo is a hard thing. But at the same time, it's the closest love you're ever gonna have. Juggalos are a family; sometimes the only family a person has ever had There's never been anything like Juggalos in the history of music and there never will be again. Forty or fifty years from now, people are gonna look back and just be like “Holy shit! What the fuck was that?” But the biggest misconception is that (Juggalos) are a gang. That's so fucking ridiculous. Just the dumbest fucking shit ever. Just by declaring that, they've put so many fucking kids in danger. You know what I'm sayin'? Some fucking kid from Asshole, Nebraska is a Juggalo from a town of like a thousand people and then he goes into a real city and the mall, like a Hot Topic or whatever, and he's gonna get approached by a security guard or a cop just for having an (ICP) tattoo. It's so insane and stupid.
You had a big cult hit in 2009 with your song “Miracles.” So I have to ask — fucking magnets. How DO they work?
Magnets? I don't fucking know. You know what I'm sayin'? People act like we're stupid ‘cause we fucking said it, but c'mon, how do they work — no one really fuckin' knows. It's like in Journey to the Center of the Earth when they were talking about different layers of the Earth and stuff and they can't figure out why the Earth has magnetism because they don't know what the fuck is in the core. So no, I don't know (how magnets work) and I don't fucking care. I just know they hold up my kids' pictures on the refrigerator and I'm happy with that.
In your 1999 song "Fuck The World" you said "And fuck Lyle Lovett – whoever the fuck he is." Did you ever discover who Lyle Lovett is?
I think he's that big chicken-looking guy who was like married to some actress. He's some country singer, right?

[efoods]A mask similar to one President Barack Obama himself wore in a “Saturday Night Live” skit prompted a Portland school principal to ban a boy from performing while wearing it at his elementary school talent show after deciding the rubber likeness of the 44th president was “inappropriate and potentially offensive.”
Dru Lechert-Kelly, 11, a fifth-grader at Llewellyn Elementary School in Southeast Portland, decided to dress up like his role model and dance to a popular YouTube song that features an Obama look-alike dancing to a parody called “I Can Do Whatever I Like.”
Dru performed the skit in front of teachers and students during a rehearsal for Llewellyn's annual talent show Thursday. He wore a navy blue suit, white shirt, red tie, black shoes and an Obama mask purchased at a costume shop. The choreographed routine ended with Dru on the floor in the splits.

Let's start with a definition of Censorship:
Censorship is the suppression of speech or other public communication which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient as determined by a government, media outlet, or other controlling body.
As you might be aware if you follow this blog, I wrote a third book entitled Java EE 7. A technical book about Java EE which part of it managed to get censored by my editor. Here are the pages that got censored, and here is why I am not happy about it.
The Censored Pages
In the introduction pages of my Java EE 7 book I thanked people who helped me in the writing process, and added the following two pages :
Once upon a time, I wrote a book entitled “Beginning Java EE 6 Platform with GlassFish 3: From Novice to Professional” with Apress. The book got published in May 2009, just before the actual Java EE 6 specification was released. I spent the following months touring Java conferences, talking about Java EE 6, giving books away, showing my Portuguese passport to foreign customs and traveling from Paris to San Francisco, Prague, Krakow, London…. the joys of being a European and being able to travel the world, buy a flight ticket online and talk at any conference I fancy. Luxury? No, banality. On October 27th 2009, while my Java EE 6 book was getting momentum, I received this funny email:
____
Dear Antonio,
Thanks to your endeavor, though I did know nothing about JEE or J2EE development, I am learning JEE6 by now. I am living in a country in which an international banking account, like Visa or MasterCard, is hard to obtain and as I know, the rule is not clarified by law yet. It shames me to say that I copied your book's PDF illegally and I hope you forgive me for that. To cover what I have done, I tried to collect some typing problems and give opinions on some parts, hoping that they could be useful for future publications of this book. Though it is less than a month that I have started the book, I felt it would be better to send what I have collected up to now (until chapter 9) and send the rest, if any, in future. Antonio, some say we are like each other by face! Truly Yours, Youness Teimoury, Software Engineer
(The most top score entrant in international entrance exam of “Azad University – Software Engineering (associate to bachelor degree)- 2003, IRAN)
____
I received many emails from people asking for questions, thanking me for the book or not agreeing with me… but it was the first time I read something like “It shames me to say that I copied your book's PDF illegally and I hope you forgive me for that”. How would you react to an email like that? To be honest, I didn't think a second “Bastard, he downloaded my book illegally” but “Gee, there are places on this planet where people can't go to Amazon, enter their credit card details and receive a book”. The signature of the email was interesting of course: “Iran”. I first went “Hey, I should do a conference there” and then… “Hum… maybe not the right timing”. So this unknown smart developer in Iran called Youness downloaded a copy of my book illegally because it was nearly impossible to get a hard copy posted to him. He liked my book so much and felt so guilty that he decided to give me some feedback and corrections. So for weeks Youness sent me pages and pages of reviews. Hundreds of items, from small typos to technical thoughts. All in a table format in a very structured way with page number, problem encountered and possible correction. I was amazed by this guy. Most of his comments were accurate. He had spent hours and hours reading every single page of my book, every code example, compiling it, analyzing it and giving me his opinion. Of course, a second edition of my Java EE 6 book got published and I thanked Youness for his help. The second edition got better thanks to the feedback of the entire Java community… but also thanks to Youness' hard work of discovering every little tiny mistake. And here I am now, in 2013 writing a Java EE 7 book, the one you have in front of you (legally I hope ;o). If you've never written a book you should know that it's the most difficult and stressful thing you might do in your life (after raising a kid of course). As usual I was late, I was begging APress to give me a few extra weeks, I was sleeping 4 hours per night, writing during days, nights and weekends… and still running late. I only had two more chapters to go… and thought of multi-threading. “Who could help me to write the remaining pages?”. Four years after our email exchanges, I remembered Youness. I asked him if he could help me to finish the XML & JSon chapter… and he accepted. Thanks for helping me out Youness, thanks for taking the time to write most of the chapter. When you read Chapter 12, realize that most of it is from Youness, a smart guy with an infinite energy. Having used Linx, Mosaic and Gopher at university a long long time ago, I can say that I have been using the Internet for a long time. I have many good things to say about it, but I'm afraid I have more bad things to say about the Internet. The Internet is still a chaotic civilization, with no rules, where the best and the worse live next to each other at a URL click. You can get a copy of a book illegally, watch free hard porn videos or read the best free encyclopedia, thanks to crowd sourcing. I don't know how the Internet will evolve, I don't know if it will get worse or better. I am not the one to judge what is good or bad anyway. I just want to thank the Internet for this magic communication channel it has become. I want to thank the Internet for introducing me to a smart, respectful and generous human being I would never have “met” in real life. So no matter how bad I think the Internet could go, I will always remember this virtual meeting I had with Youness four years ago. Who is Youness? In these dark times of “getting a definition right”, I could not say he is a friend, a colleague or an acquaintance. In which Google Circle should I add him? I've never seen him in real life but spent a hundred of emails and hours “talking” to him virtually. Now I know I have a special “friend” living in Iran, an important country for our civilizations. This is where everything started, and today it looks like we've forgotten about it. I hope one day I'll be able to travel to Iran, talk about Java EE 7 at local conferences, have a drink with Youness, understand a bit more about his life, his culture and walk with him in the streets of Tehran. Because no matter how virtual this world will get, “Some say we are like each other by face!”
Why this text got censored ?
When my editor read this text, he just deleted it without informing me. Weeks later, when I was reviewing the final chapters, I noticed that a couple of pages were missing. I asked my editor what had happened and received the following :
The main problem with the anecdote, though well-intentioned, was that it seemed to condone piracy which we spend a lot of money trying to combat. (…) and we're not permitted to sell our books in Iran at the moment
So the text was censored because books are not accessible throughout the planet in an even manner and because the financial model on the Internet is completely chaotic and broken.
Not publishing books in Iran
IANAL (I am not a lawyer) but I've spent years reading software licences and other disclaimers about embargoes and products not being allowed in Cuba, Iran or any country trying to get the nuclear bomb and not being approved by countries who already have it. I would never have thought that my Java book could be part of such censorship. History has shown that censorship is the best way to alienate people. Giving access to knowledge is, on the opposite, the best way to educate them… and education is frightening because it can lead to revolutions or mass strikes (like what we have been seeing lately in some countries) . So the work of an editor should be to give access to knowledge to the entire Humanity, not to censor it to a group of “not respected humans”.
Piracy
Another issue about this text was piracy. It is a very difficult topic. I am an author, I spent months of very hard work writing a book, taking literally months off work, with no incomes and putting myself into a difficult financial situation. As an author I would like to be paid for the work I've done. Piracy is, indeed, something to blame. But how do we address that ? Editors spend a lot of money “chasing piracy” throughout the world. The world is getting more complex, with more connected people… meaning editors will have to spend even more money chasing piracy. So, the model is not right. Chasing piracy is a very short term view on edition, in particular, but also on the financial model of the internet. All this wasted money decreases the revenue of the author. I'm sure you've all heard “you don't write books to make a living”, and it is true. Authors do not earn a lot. So yes, maybe the entire model is broken.
And BTW, isn't it weird to not publish books in Iran and then talk about piracy in a country that you censor ?
The “Connected Man” at the center of the universe
The Renaissance was a very important period in Man's history : it considered Man the centre of the universe (putting god aside). Today we are living a new Renaissance : connected Men are the center of the universe. Connected people use social medias to go on strikes, make revolution…. Journalists don't go to hot places anymore, editors censor texts…. Well, guess what, we might not need you in the near future. Why read a journalist article when you know that he was not allowed to go near the hotspots and just re-uses other people information ? Just read people's blog, Tweets and make up your mind, cross-reference information so you know it's accurate. Why read a book when you know the editor had to censor parts of it ? Just read the source and make up your mind.
Conclusion
I am a Java developer and it happens that, once in a while, I write a book about it. I am not a philosopher, a troublemaker (well…) or a new revolutionary Che Guevara. I am a technical guy who writes technical books. When I wrote this text it was to thank Youness for his hard work and tell a story. In 2013, an editor felt he had to censor it so he would not create any trouble with international laws and financial issues. On the other hand, I am a free individual who can today avoid such censor.
I was talking with my friend Adam Bien who self-publishes his Java books. I will consider self-publication in the future if I decided to write another book.
Again, thanks Youness and sorry for all this trouble. You deserved better that being censored because of the country you live in. Hope to tour the streets of Tehran with you in an early future.
The parents of a Hanover Park boy who has an autism spectrum disorder are suing the Boy Scouts of America Northwest Suburban Council for what the lawsuit calls the "improper and illegal" revocation of the child's membership.
Brian and Deborah Smith say in the lawsuit, filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, that their teenage son has Asperger's syndrome, a disorder that affects language and behavioral development in children.
According to the suit, their son was a member for more than seven years and a patrol leader in Northwest Suburban Council Troop 399, but last July, the family received a vague notice from the council revoking his membership.
"Without warning or any effort to complete the steps set forth in the BSA publications, on July 22, 2014 Plaintiffs received a notice from Boys Scouts of America that (the boy's) membership in BSA was revoked effective immediately," the lawsuit said. "The notice did not articulate any reason why the termination was made other than that 'information was received which 'compelled us to revoke your son.'"
Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith issued the following statement:
"We were only recently made aware of this suit, but we will closely review this matter and respond appropriately. While we can't immediately discuss this matter, I can tell you that the BSA works to accommodate the needs of Scouts."
In a phone interview Monday, the boy's parents described feeling surprised upon receiving the letter.
"Our family has been very involved in Scouts for years," Brian Smith said. "They talk about how to deal with discipline, policy and procedures; they don't just send letters completely out of the blue."
According to the lawsuit, the boy, identified therein as "P.S.," suffered from "severe emotional distress" and needed counseling services.
"He was completely devastated," Deborah Smith said. "It took a long while to get over the hurt. It was a huge hole in who he was. All of his goals were around Scouts. He had been doing it since first grade."
The boy, "who loves the outdoors and scouting," is currently working on a farm, his father said.
The suit cites the Boy Scouts of America's "Guide to Working with Scouts with Special Needs and Disabilities," which states that there must be "preestablished consequences for misbehavior for all Scouts." The guide also requires that "the discipline fits the offense and is not unduly harsh."
The Smiths are seeking further explanation on the circumstances that led the council to strip their son's membership and that the decision be overturned.

Drew Carey is a stand-up comic turned actor and producer and is now regarded as American soccer's most recognizable supporter. Carey is an owner of Seattle Sounders FC and serves as chairman of Sounders FC Alliance, the club's member association.
Carey had the distinction of having two hit shows simultaneously: the long-running comedy “The Drew Carey Show,” which ran from 1995-2004, and the improv/sketch show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” on which he was host and a producer. The success of that show led to the creation of “Drew Carey's Improv All-Stars,” an improvement group that performs in showrooms across the country. In July 2007, Carey was named the host of “The Price Is Right,” America's longest-running game show.
While in the Marine Reserves, his military buzz cut and black wide-rim glasses became part of his trademark look. He began his successful career as a comedian in April of 1986 at the Cleveland Comedy Club. One of his first big breaks was competing on Star Search ‘88. In 1991, Carey landed a spot on HBO's 14th Annual Young Comedians Special and appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Carey openly credits Carson with launching his career. He received a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003.
Carey's interest in soccer began while attending an L.A. Galaxy game in 2003. Shortly after, he started seeing every professional game he could find time for, including European league games and U.S. National Team qualifying games. He learned more about the game and, during a later visit to Spain, saw FC Barcelona in action. He also worked as a press photographer during the 2006 World Cup in Germany, his efforts chronicled on a Travel Channel show entitled “Drew Carey's Sporting Adventures” and his photos have appeared in numerous publications.
During his travels Carey became fascinated with the empowerment of supporters at such clubs as Barcelona and Real Madrid, where leadership positions are voted upon by the members. He brought that idea to Sounders FC, where members will vote on various matters, most notably the fate of the general manager every four years. Carey is also the driving force for Seattle's 53-piece marching band, Sound Wave. Carey is a native of Cleveland, Ohio and currently resides in Los Angeles.
The changes mean the LNP now holds 75 seats in the 89-seat Parliament, down from the 78 it won it its landslide victory in March but still a massive majority. Labor still has seven seats, Katter's Australian Party has seen its representation increase from two to three, and the number of independents has doubled from two to four. LNP president Bruce McIver said he was disappointed by the resignations as the MPs “sought the endorsement of local party members at preselection and then carried our party's flag into the state election”. “Deeply disappointing is that the people of their electorates voted overwhelmingly for a change of government in Queensland – and for a strong voice in that new LNP government – and they have now been denied that representation,” Mr McIver said in a statement issued on Thursday evening. Parliamentary rules mean individual MPs can quit a party and continue to serve as an independent, or switch to a different party, without facing a by-election.
But Mr McIver said the LNP would move quickly to preselect a strong LNP candidate for each of these electorates “as soon as practicable ahead of the next state election”. Dr Douglas argued he was best suited to serve his Gold Coast electorate as an independent. ‘‘It is with great sadness I tender my resignation,'' Dr Douglas said on Thursday afternoon. Dr Douglas said the public did not want to see a ‘‘blunder-through method'' of governance. ‘‘There are better ways of running government than this approach,'' he said.
Dr Douglas, who this week engaged in a war of words with senior Newman government figures over his removal from the ethics committee chairmanship, had emerged from a party room meeting on Wednesday night saying he wanted to remain an LNP member and would ‘‘probably die one''. Government MPs, at the party room meeting, had already voted to request the LNP disendorse Mr Judge for alleged disloyalty. "It's my responsibility to represent my electorate and, sadly, I do not believe this government is fulfilling its election promises," Mr Judge told Parliament on Thursday afternoon. Mr Judge said he had supported the policies the LNP took to the election and he acknowledged the volunteers who helped his campaign. In a speech sometimes punctuated by heckling from LNP MPs, Mr Judge said the government had not lived up to pledges to govern with grace and humility.
“The public service were informed they had nothing to fear. We all know that that's not true,” he said. “These two basic pledges have been brought into question time and time again.” Mr Judge said he acknowledged that state debt levels had to be addressed, but this needed to be done in a way that was respectful to people. He expressed concern for the plight of public servants with young families and mortgages to pay, saying the government had caused them turmoil and stress. Mr Judge said debate should be respectful.
“I simply cannot serve with people who lack respect and want to yell abuse across the chamber,” Mr Judge said, in a reference to parliamentary interjections from his former colleagues. Mr Judge attacked both major parties over broken election promises. He pointed to Premier Campbell Newman's assurances that public servants had nothing to fear, Prime Minister Julia Gillard no carbon tax promise, and former premier Anna Bligh's asset sales pledge. Mr Judge said he was greatly saddened by the turn of events and noted that there were people he respected greatly across the political spectrum, including MPs for Katter's Australian Party and independents. Several Labor MPs came over to shake Mr Judge's hand after the speech. Mr Judge was moved to a seat next to the Labor opposition on Tuesday, a day after Deputy Premier Jeff Seeney announced the MP would be banned from party room meetings until he pledged 100 per cent loyalty.
This morning, Fairfax Media revealed Mr Judge several months ago confronted a staffer in a Newman government minister's office over an email, sent from an anonymous Gmail account, that warned Mr Judge he was being watched. The employee subsequently resigned. Mr Newman insisted the LNP government was getting on with the job of governing, despite being let down by several members. “The men and women of the LNP team, apart from a couple of people who had their personal issues, are strong and united,” he told reporters two hours before the resignations were confirmed. “They're the ones who feel that certain people have let down their team and constituents.” After Mr Judge and Dr Douglas announced their resignations, Mr Palmer held his second media conference of the day. Mr Palmer has raised the prospect of forming a new political force called the United Australia Party.
‘‘I think you'll see things happening in the coming weeks,'' he said, arguing the chances of the new party being formed were "more than 50 per cent". Mr Palmer said voters were ‘‘disgusted'' at the Newman government's behaviour. ‘‘What we're seeing in the electorate is a great amount of concern for the civil liberties of Queenslanders and their right to be able to express their point of view,'' he said. Mr Palmer said he wouldn't get rid of his business interests if he set up a party, but either way he's not interested in becoming premier. ‘‘I'm a reluctant warrior, I don't really want to get involved in politics,'' he said.
Loading ‘‘I think I'm too fat to be premier, you want to have a nice tanned guy as premier to promote the tourist industry.'' - with AAP
This post will show you how to create printable numbered raffle tickets at home.
> STOP PRESS: You can use this online tool to design and print your own raffle tickets <
(Or read on to learn how to do it manually in Publisher!)
1. Create your raffle ticket in Publisher
Too much like hard work? Try this online tool to design and print your own raffle tickets without battling with Excel and Publisher!
2. Create a list of raffle ticket numbers in Excel (or another spreadsheet program).
3. Add the numbers to your raffle tickets in Publisher
C'mon, this is crazy-complicated! Save yourself a few hours and try this tool which lets you design and print your own raffle tickets online. Print them at home, as many as you need.
Or, read on for the rest of the do-it-yourself-the-hard-way instructions. ;-)
If you got to the end of these instructions, then well done you! If skipped to bottom, then maybe consider trying this online tool to design and print your own raffle tickets without battling with Excel and Publisher! You can design awesome tickets and print them at home, just with a few clicks, all in your web browser:
You've found this post, so you already know creating raffle tickets to print out yourself is harder than it sounds.A few days ago my wife asked me if I could help her print out raffle tickets for our local kindergarten quiz night. She had this Word document, with the raffle tickets neatly arranged on the page and wasMy first thought:Turns out it took the best part of an afternoon.Getting Word to put a unique number on each raffle ticket is easy enough, but persuading Word to print out several uniquely-numbered raffle tickets per sheet of paper is very hard (I think it is impossible, actually. At least I couldn't figure it out.). And you don't really want to have every raffle ticket use up a whole sheet of paper.But you can do it with Microsoft Publisher. Here are the step-by-step instructions:Open Publisher and click on File... > New to create a new blank document. Depending on your settings, you'll get a bunch of options here with different templates and sizes. You just need to create a new blank document, it doesn't matter what size because you are going to change the size in a minute.Once you have your new blank document, go to File... > Page Setup... to set the correct size. You want to set this to the size of your raffle ticket,the size of paper you are printing on. You probably want 4 raffle tickets per page, sothen set the size to 20cm wide x 7cm high, with 1cm margins:If you are printing on Letter size paper, then use 7.5" wide, 2.5" high and margins of 0.5":Now add text and maybe a logo to create your raffle ticket. Remember to:- Include a ticket stub which you can tear off- Leave space for the raffle ticket number (we'll be adding that in a moment)- Include any legal wording your local regulations require (in the UK, you'll probably need a license from your local council, and include details of that on the raffle ticket. More about that here. Open Excel and create a new workbook. In cell A1, type the number "1" (without quotes) (or another number, if you want to start your numbering from a different number):In the cell below, type "=A1+1" (without quotes) and hit enter/return:That'll put a 2 in that cell, like this:Now click the tiny black square in the bottom right of that cell, keep your mouse button clicked and drag down for as many rows as you need raffle tickets:... all the way down to (say) 500 rows (to give you 500 unique ticket numbers):Now save your spreadsheet somewhere you can find it again, and close Excel.Return to Publisher and click on Tools > Mailings and Catalogs > Mail Merge...A big panel should appear on the left hand side of the screen.Check that "Use an existing list" is selected, then click "Next: Create or connect to an existing list":Navigate to where you earlier saved your raffle ticket numbers spreadsheet and click Open:On the next screen, be sure to, then click OK:Just click OK on the next screen:Now you need to put a ticket number placeholder on your raffle ticket. Click where you need the raffle ticket number to appear, then click "F1" in the left hand panel:Repeat for the stub, to print the ticket number there also:Now, down the bottom of the lefthand panel, click "Next: Create merged publications":Then, click "Print...":Now, pay attention for this last step. Check all of the following:1. Select "Multiple Pages per sheet" (Multiple Copies per sheet)2. Choose the correct paper size for the paper you are actually printing on (A4 or Letter)3. Select "Portrait"4. Under "Page Range", click "Entries:" and type "1-4" (without quotes) (so you just print first four tickets for now, to check things over)5. Click "Print"Something like this should pop out of your printer. Four raffle tickets on a page, each with a different number:If you are happy with the results, click "Print..." again in the left hand panel:But this time set Page Range to "All entries":... and click the Print button, then all your raffle tickets will come out of the printer, each with a unique ticket number.Congratulations!

The Giants reportedly had wanted a first-round pick for disgruntled defensive end Osi Umenyiora. Now, the Giants reportedly want a second-round pick for Osi.
The new report comes from Mike Preston of the Baltimore Sun, who also reports that the Ravens and Patriots are two of the teams considering making the deal. Ralph Vacchiano of the New York Daily News has reported that the Rams, Chargers, Seahawks, and Broncos also are interested.
The bigger impediment remains making Umenyiora happy with a new contract. Per Preston, the Ravens likely would have to sign defensive tackle Haloti Ngata to a new deal that would drop his cap number from that eight-figure franchise tender.
Even then, it's a risk, given Umenyiora's injury history. Still, Preston reports that several of the Ravens' bigwigs are urging G.M. Ozzie Newsome to do the deal.
''Interchange is one of my topics that we have been discussing on the way around. I am sure we will be discussing that,'' Anderson said yesterday. ''I wouldn't say there are any major concerns. There are issues that we have been discussing.
''Protecting players from injuries has been a long-standing issue, congestion is a topic that we have been discussing and keeping the game a great free-flowing spectacle that is one of its core attributes.
''This coincides with us having completed our first round of visits to all of the club coaches and leadership groups. We are going to give the AFLPA executive an update of where we have got to.''
Several players have told The Age they fear the AFL is particularly keen to have two on the bench and two substitutes in the belief this would further tire players, therefore reducing the number of players with the energy to get to stoppages, thus reducing the number of stoppages, to make the game more free-flowing.
When pressed on the possibility of a two-and-two interchange being introduced, Anderson replied: ''I have got no doubt the interchange is one of the many topics that we are discussing. It's not the only thing that is related to congestion.''
Come what may, I never really expected Justice League to top $1 billion at the global box office. Even before the reviews rolled in, it was a longshot that this third chapter to a poorly received Zack Snyder superhero trilogy would end up making boatloads more than its predecessor. After all, as a sequel to Batman v Superman, it had the disadvantage of losing viewership from audiences who didn't care for the grimdark smackdown and, even with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman riding high, decided this one out.
It would be like expecting Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows to do anywhere near as well as The Blair Witch Project despite a lot of general moviegoers not liking that first installment. That said, I will admit that an under $800 million total, and a probable under $700m global total, is something of a surprise. Maybe it shouldn't have been since Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (a better, lighter, more kid-friendly sequel to a successful but indifferently received predecessor) stumbled out of the gate in June of 2016.
Justice League will not be crossing the fabled $1 billion mark. The reason this matters is that the so-called $1 billion+ club now exclusively belongs to Walt Disney and Universal/Comcast Corp. It has been 3.5 years since the last non-Disney/Universal movie to earn over $1b worldwide, and it's probably going to be a while before we get another one.
Furious 7 was the 20th $1 billion+ release in April 2015, while Fate of the Furious was the 30th such member in April 2017. Every single new entry has been either a Disney or Universal release. And, with the caveat that overseas exchange rates probably cheated WB and New Line's last two Hobbit movies out of the arbitrary milestone, we haven't had a $1b+ grosser from a studio that isn't Universal or Disney since Paramount/Viacom Inc.'s Transformers: Age of Extinction back in June 2014.
And with Justice League struggling to get past $650 million (and hopefully $700m), that's not something that's going to change anytime soon. In the last 3.5 years, we've had five Universal movies (Furious 7, Jurassic World, Minions, Fate of the Furious and Despicable Me 3) and eight Disney movies (Avengers: Age of Ultron, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Zootopia, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Beauty and the Beast and presumably Star Wars: The Last Jedi). And looking at the release slates for the near future, it looks like Disney and Universal will once again be leading the way.
To wit, Disney has likely 2018 contenders in Avengers: Infinity War, Solo: A Star Wars Story and possibly The Incredibles 2. Universal has Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. The field gets more crowded for Disney in 2019 (Avengers: What Kind of Day It Has Been, Star Wars IX, Frozen 2, Toy Story 3, Aladdin, The Lion King) and with possible contenders for Universal in the Statham/Rock Fast and Furious spinoff and The Secret Life of Pets 2. Hell, if M. Night Shyamalan's Glass goes the distance (it will not), then Disney and Universal will have one to share.
We'll see what MCU movies, Star Wars movies and animated offerings Disney will bring to the table after 2019, and ditto Universal's Jurassic World sequels, Illumination sequels (Minions 2 in 2020) and Fast and Furious chapters. But whether or not The Lion King or Secret Life of Pets 2 go above and beyond (or How to Train Your Dragon 3 and Black Panther surprise us all), there is very little coming from the competition that could reasonably be expected to hit that milestone. And that's assuming Fox doesn't get bought by Disney in the next month or so thus making Deadpool 2 (the only remotely plausible Fox release on tap that might pull it off) a Walt Disney release.
Sony has a contender in the Spider-Man sequel, in that it follows Avengers: That Which Shall Not Be Named and a contender if they end up with the overseas distribution rights for the next 007 movie. The Bond flick will presumably be Daniel Craig's farewell, which will make it something of an event. Both of these are in 2019, and nothing on Sony's slate in 2018 (Hotel Transylvania 3, Venom, Peter Rabbit, etc.) screams $1 billion+ grosser. Sony has plenty of smaller-scale offerings on tap (Proud Mary, Jumanji, Goosebumps 2), but in terms of the big leagues, it'll still probably come down to Spider-Man and James Bond.
Ditto Paramount's 2018 slate unless Mission: Impossible 6 uses its first 3D conversion to go wild off the backs of the much-loved Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation. But that would be a big bump from the prior two over/under $690 million-grossing sequels. The last Transformers movie barely topped $600m, meaning that the 80s-set Bumblebee prequel and the would-be Transformers 7 aren't exactly sitting pretty. And while I won't automatically write off Top Gun 2 or Terminator 3 version 3 in summer 2019, either of those films breaking $500m global would be considered a win. Ditto a theoretical Star Trek 4.
You don't need me to explain that Lionsgate isn't looking for anything resembling a $1 billion+ winner, and ditto the prestige/boutique distributors like A24, Open Road, Broad Green, etc. That leaves Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc. They, per usual, have a ton of big product on their slate. But of the promising material on tap for the next two years (Ready Player One, Tomb Raider, Rampage, The Meg, the various Conjuring movies, Aquaman, LEGO Movie 2, It Chapter 2, Godzilla 2, etc.), the only ones that maybe/possibly could pull it off are J.K. Rowling's Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald in November 2018 and/or Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman 2 in November 2019.
Both are anticipated sequels to well-liked/leggy predecessors that topped $800 million global. Maybe both franchises peaked in the first installment, or maybe they'll both be relative breakout sequels. Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman was the biggest domestic grosser not from Disney or Universal since The Hunger Games: Catching Fire in late 2013, and it was the biggest-grossing domestic 3D release since Avatar way back in 2009. Might Wonder Woman 2 also be the first member of the $1 billion club not to come from Disney or Universal since Transformers: Age of Extinction 5.5 years prior?
The issue is that IP and franchises rule the roast, and yet it is significantly harder to launch a new-to-cinema blockbuster franchise than even a few years ago, to the point where I still maintain that The Hunger Games may have been our last A-level new-to-movies cinematic franchise. And, thanks to exchange rates and dwindling theatrical attendance, it's tougher than ever to hit what was once an unthinkable milestone. That is arguably how it should be.
From around 2010 to 2014, membership in the once-vaunted $1 billion+ club soared to the point where it became the new expected level of blockbuster success for a would-be mega-hit movie. But Disney and Universal, especially Disney, have utterly dominated the highest peaks of movie blockbuster performance, to the point where it may remain an exclusive club for a very long time. The good news is that if movies aren't expected to hit that milestone, they won't be budgeted so that they almost have to hit that milestone.
In the long run, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Justice League failing to hit $1 billion+ worldwide may be a very good thing for the overall industry. Maybe we'll have to wait until Avatar 2 in December of 2020 for another non-Universal/Disney $1 billion+ grosser. Well, that's assuming that's not a Walt Disney release by then.
Union minister Smriti Irani on Thursday said that, where the Nehru-Gandhi family hadn't fulfilled its promises in the past 60 years, the Modi-led NDA govt had delivered in two.

“The work, which Congress could not do in past 60 years, the present Narendra Modi government has done only in two years. You all workers should be prepared for 2017 UP assembly polls,” she said, inaugurating a rest house at a bus station in Salon, which falls in Amethi Lok Sabha constituency represented by Rahul.
“The Nehru-Gandhi family has not fulfilled its promises due to which I have reduced victory margin of Rahul by 80 per cent,” Irani, who had contested against the Congress Vice President in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, said.
[related-post]
“How will politics of family help Amethi ?” she said.
Irani said Congress workers were “dissatisfied and their behaviour was not normal.”
Asked whether she would be BJP's chief ministerial candidate for 2017 UP Assembly polls, Irani said, “I am a disciplined party worker and will follow whatever order is given.”
On contesting again from Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, her refrain was the same.
Replying to a question on her visits to Amethi, Irani said, “I go there as Smriti Irani but the love of the people has made me ‘didi' and we will continue to work for the people of this constituency.”
Stressing that development will be speeded up, she said, “Our main objective is to provide the needy people basic amenities.”

On chanting ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai', Irani said it is the right of every Indian to chant it but it should be not “forced” on anyone.

Turkey's governing AK party has lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years, near-complete election results show.
The surprise outcome also sees the pro-Kurdish HDP crossing the 10% threshold, securing seats for the first time.
With 99% of the vote counted, the AKP has 41% of the vote, state-run TRT television reports.
The result is a blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's plans to boost his office's powers.
President Erdoğan, who first came to power as prime minister in 2003, had been seeking a two-thirds majority to turn Turkey into a presidential republic.

Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu appeared to have accepted the results. "The people's decision is the most correct decision," he said while preparing to fly from his hometown of Konya to the capital, Ankara.
The BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul
The AKP has polled worse than it ever feared and lost its majority. President Erdoğan will be unable to change the constitution and extend his powers.
It's a stark contrast with the HDP, which gambled to run as a single party for the first time, hoping to cross the 10% threshold. It paid off, gaining a significant voice for the Kurdish minority on the national stage.
It succeeded by appealing beyond the Kurds, drawing in leftists and staunch Erdoğan opponents with its message of equality, gay rights and environmental concerns.
This could be the start of a new political era here; a major setback for a president who has polarised this nation.
In a volatile Middle East, Turkey matters greatly - and so the path it takes, the nature of its democracy and the leaders it produces, all have implications far beyond its borders.
Image copyright AP Image caption President Erdoğan's party has been ruling Turkey since 2003
Sunday's election has produced an extraordinary result and represents a major change in Turkish politics, the BBC's Mark Lowen says.
The party that once seemed unstoppable for 13 years under Mr Erdoğan may now struggle to form a government.
The AKP looks likely to win 258 seats in parliament, 18 fewer than it requires for a majority, forcing it to form a minority government or enter into a coalition.
Our correspondent says that there is now a subdued and glum atmosphere at the Justice and Development Party (AKP) headquarters in contrast to a sense of jubilation among HDP supporters at news that their party had won around 13% of the vote and would enter parliament for the first time.
"This was a victory of democracy over political corruption... of peace over war," HDP deputy Sirri Sureyya Onder said.
Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption HDP leader Selahattin Demirtas has ruled out forming a coalition with the AKP
The HDP's leader ruled out a coalition with the AKP on Sunday, pointing out that the election results had put an end to discussions about a presidential system.
"The discussion of executive presidency and dictatorship have come to an end in Turkey with these elections," Selahattin Demirtas told a news conference in Istanbul.
The HDP is projected to get between 75 to 80 seats after successfully attracting votes beyond its Kurdish support base.
The Republican People's Party (CHP) is set to be the second largest party, as in the previous parliament, with around 25% of the vote.
CHP Istanbul Chairman Murat Karayalcin said that results show a clear rejection by voters of Mr Erdoğan's drive for greater powers.
"Voters said a clear no to the presidential system," Mr Karayalcin said.
One game that Nintendo Switch owners are no doubt looking forward to this summer is the long-awaited Sonic Mania. As you probably already know the game is only set to be available digitally. However, SEGA's Product Manager Jim Dyer says that the company would love to do a physical release. It sounds as though they're taking a wait and see approach to see how well the game does digitally before committing to a physical one.
“We would love to do one. We want the community to know that we are listening, and at SXSW they suggested a lot of interest in us following through with a physical release. But we're also aware that audience approves of anything Sonic related, so while we are listening and it is something we'd like to do, at this stage we are going to see how it goes.”

AT FIRST glance the patriarchy appears to be thriving. More than 90% of presidents and prime ministers are male, as are nearly all big corporate bosses. Men dominate finance, technology, films, sports, music and even stand-up comedy. In much of the world they still enjoy social and legal privileges simply because they have a Y chromosome. So it might seem odd to worry about the plight of men.
Yet there is plenty of cause for concern. Men cluster at the bottom as well as the top. They are far more likely than women to be jailed, estranged from their children, or to kill themselves. They earn fewer university degrees than women. Boys in the developed world are 50% more likely to flunk basic maths, reading and science entirely.

One group in particular is suffering (see article). Poorly educated men in rich countries have had difficulty coping with the enormous changes in the labour market and the home over the past half-century. As technology and trade have devalued brawn, less-educated men have struggled to find a role in the workplace. Women, on the other hand, are surging into expanding sectors such as health care and education, helped by their superior skills. As education has become more important, boys have also fallen behind girls in school (except at the very top). Men who lose jobs in manufacturing often never work again. And men without work find it hard to attract a permanent mate. The result, for low-skilled men, is a poisonous combination of no job, no family and no prospects.
From nuclear families to fissile ones
Those on the political left tend to focus on economics. Shrinking job opportunities for men, they say, are entrenching poverty and destroying families. In America pay for men with only a high-school certificate fell by 21% in real terms between 1979 and 2013; for women with similar qualifications it rose by 3%. Around a fifth of working-age American men with only a high-school diploma have no job.
Those on the right worry about the collapse of the family. The vast majority of women would prefer to have a partner who does his bit both financially and domestically. But they would rather do without one than team up with a layabout, which may be all that is on offer: American men without jobs spend only half as much time on housework and caring for others as do women in the same situation, and much more time watching television.
Hence the unravelling of working-class families. The two-parent family, still the norm among the elite, is vanishing among the poor. In rich countries the proportion of births outside marriage has trebled since 1980, to 33%. In some areas where traditional manufacturing has collapsed, it has reached 70% or more. Children raised in broken homes learn less at school, are more likely to drop out and earn less late on than children from intact ones. They are also not very good at forming stable families of their own.
These two sides often talk past each other. But their explanations are not contradictory: both economics and social change are to blame, and the two causes reinforce each other. Moreover, these problems are likely to get worse. Technology will disrupt more industries, creating benefits for society but rendering workers who fail to update their skills redundant. The OECD, a think-tank, predicts that the absolute number of single-parent households will continue to rise in nearly all rich countries. Boys who grow up without fathers are more likely to have trouble forming lasting relationships, creating a cycle of male dysfunction.
Tinker, tailor, soldier, hairdresser
What can be done? Part of the solution lies in a change in cultural attitudes. Over the past generation, middle-class men have learned that they need to help with child care, and have changed their behaviour. Working-class men need to catch up. Women have learned that they can be surgeons and physicists without losing their femininity. Men need to understand that traditional manual jobs are not coming back, and that they can be nurses or hairdressers without losing their masculinity.
Policymakers also need to lend a hand, because foolish laws are making the problem worse. America reduces the supply of marriageable men by locking up millions of young males for non-violent offences and then making it hard for them to find work when they get out (in Georgia, for example, felons are barred from feeding pigs, fighting fires or working in funeral homes). A number of rich countries discourage poor people from marrying or cohabiting by cutting their benefits if they do.
Even more important than scrapping foolish policies is retooling the educational system, which was designed in an age when most men worked with their muscles. Politicians need to recognise that boys' underachievement is a serious problem, and set about fixing it. Some sensible policies that are good for everybody are particularly good for boys. Early-childhood education provides boys with more structure and a better chance of developing verbal and social skills. Countries with successful vocational systems such as Germany have done a better job than Anglo-Saxon countries of motivating non-academic boys and guiding them into jobs, but policymakers need to reinvent vocational education for an age when trainees are more likely to get jobs in hospitals than factories.
More generally, schools need to become more boy-friendly. They should recognise that boys like to rush around more than girls do: it's better to give them lots of organised sports and energy-eating games than to dose them with Ritalin or tell them off for fidgeting. They need to provide more male role models: employing more male teachers in primary schools will both supply boys with a male to whom they can relate and demonstrate that men can be teachers as well as firefighters.
The growing equality of the sexes is one of the biggest achievements of the post-war era: people have greater opportunities than ever before to achieve their ambitions regardless of their gender. But some men have failed to cope with this new world. It is time to give them a hand.

Project Baltimore, an investigative reporting series conducted by a local Fox affiliate in Baltimore City, has sifted through over a decade of high school records and discovered that attendance at city high schools in 2017 suddenly dropped to a 13-year low of just 76%. Just to state the obvious, the average high school in Maryland has around 1,200 students so that means that, on an average day, nearly 300 of them don't bother to show up.
Adding insult to injury, Baltimore City Police Spokesman T.J. Smith told Fox 45 that it's no coincidence that violent crime is spiking in the city just as more and more teenagers are opting to skip class.
From violent attacks on Halloween night, to a terrifying carjacking and a man pushed into the Inner Harbor. Baltimore City is under siege by criminals that, police say, are teenagers. “Every single one of them involve juveniles, who are all walking the streets today because they are probably not in school, where they belong.”
Meanwhile, Project Baltimore found that 39% of Baltimore City high school students were technically considered "chronically absent," a threshold that should result in fines or even jail time for parents...that is, if school administrators actually fulfilled their reporting requirements.
As we kept digging, we discovered this: In Baltimore City, 39 percent of high school students are considered chronically absent, or truant, by missing more than 20 days. That's 8,400 teenagers who regularly are not going to school. “Hearing that number, that's a lot of young people who could have something to do during those hours that might be on the street doing something they shouldn't be doing,” said Smith. If a child between 5 and 18-years-old doesn't go to school, state truancy laws hold parents accountable with up to $500 in fines or jail time.
Of course, as we noted previously, another Fox 45 investigation found that truant kids are being routinely passed through Baltimore City schools even if they don't bother to show up for a single day of class during an entire school year (see: "It's Very Common": Baltimore Teacher Admits To Passing Students That Never Showed For A Single Day Of Class)
But this teacher says grade changing at Calverton goes much further than just taking a failing grade and making it a 60. Some students who pass, according to this educator, don't even have grades because they've never showed up to class. “There were students on my roster all year that I had never met, had never seen. On paper they passed my class and passed onto the next year.” “I love my job and I love my students,” concluded the teacher. “I want to see the students at Calverton and other schools across the city, get a fresh start. And it's going to be hard because the students are used to this now. But the students deserve better and our city deserve better.”
And, lest you think a 76% attendance rate is 'normal', surrounding counties were found to be over 90%.
Not surprisingly, when asked about the excessive absences, a local high school in Baltimore City responded with nothing more than a generic sentence, undoubtedly drafted by an expensive, taxpayer-funded attorney, regarding the importance of regular attendance.
With nearly 40 percent of all city high schoolers truant, Fox45 asked North Avenue if it's enforcing state law by reporting parents to police. We didn't get an answer. Instead, we got a statement: “Strong attendance is essential for students' success, and the district has a longstanding commitment to ensuring that barriers to attendance are removed.” – Baltimore City Public Schools The statement lists steps the District has taken to get kids to school, which include fostering strong relationships, providing laundry services, on-site childcare and running a re-engagement center to recruit dropped outs.
Of course, despite their poor attendance records, we're almost certain that Baltimore City students will have unlimited access to $1,000 of dollars worth of student loans to attend whatever institution of higher indoctrination their hearts desire upon graduation in just a few short years...
POPULATION forecasting is not simple. Demographers use mortality data—information about when people die and why—to estimate the likely life expectancy of people still alive. The UN, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others produce periodic forecasts that are fairly similar. Wealthy countries such as Japan, Switzerland and Australia have the highest life expectancies, though the estimates vary slightly depending on the methodology used. But a new study of 35 rich countries by researchers at Imperial College London and the WHO, and published in the Lancet, a medical journal, uses a combination of 21 statistical models, instead of just one. The results, say the authors, are more reliable. They are also surprising.
By 2030, they think, South Korea will have seen the biggest gains in life expectancy for both men and women. A girl born there in 2030 is likely to live past her 90th birthday, seven years longer than one born in 2010. South Korean men are expected to live to just over 84, leapfrogging 18 other countries to the top of the ranking.

South Korea's trajectory has been remarkable. Its annual GDP per person is more than 20 times the level in 1960. America and Britain saw only a trebling over the same period. These economic gains have improved the nation's health. In 1985 life expectancy in South Korea was more than four years lower than in America for both sexes; by 2010 it had caught up for men and risen to three years higher for women. The main reasons were big reductions in child mortality, deaths from infections and deaths from diseases related to high blood pressure, which include cardiovascular disease and stroke. The share of South Koreans who have raised blood pressure is lower than in any other country. Few South Koreans suffer from obesity, which increases the chance of several chronic illnesses, including diabetes, heart problems and cancer. Smoking rates among women remain low.
Other countries expected to do well are improving for similar reasons. Few women in France and Switzerland are obese. By 2030 Hungarian men are expected to live 7.5 years longer on average than they did in 2010, partly because fewer drink too much or smoke. New Zealand, Australia and Canada have low rates of infant mortality and death from traffic accidents, and good records in preventing and treating heart disease and cancer.
But the authors predict far less progress elsewhere. In some less wealthy countries, such as Macedonia and Serbia, average life expectancies are low and predicted to improve only modestly. Sweden and Japan can also expect relatively small gains, though that may be unavoidable since they already sit near the top of the table.
The most striking outlier is America. The world′s biggest economy is among the bottom five countries in expected gains for both men and women. At 77 years for men and 81 years for women in 2010, American life expectancy is already among the lowest in the rich world. That is partly because America is the only country in the OECD that does not have universal health care, meaning poorer health for poorer people. It also has the highest maternal and child mortality rates, so fewer people reach old age. High obesity and homicide rates shorten lifespans as well.
As a result, the study predicts that life expectancies in far poorer countries will eventually overtake America′s. It finds that men born in the Czech Republic will live as long as those born in America by 2030, as will women in Croatia and Mexico. Moreover, projections of life expectancy in America may need to be revised downwards. The researchers use actual American mortality data to 2013, with forecasts beyond that point. In fact, American life expectancy fell in 2015. If Republican plans to repeal Barack Obama′s health law end up reducing access to care, this trend might accelerate.
As recently as 2000 it was thought impossible that a country's average life expectancy would ever exceed 90. That so many developed countries can expect people to live beyond 80 is testament to health-care successes. The next challenge for governments will be to ensure there are sufficient health and social care policies in place to support fast-swelling older populations.
Nothing Will Ever Be Enough
Former prisoners do not get much more “rehabilitated” than Reginald Dwayne Betts. In the time since his release in 2005, Betts has published two acclaimed books of poetry and a memoir, earned a college degree with a 4.0, earned an MFA, started a family, held a Radcliffe Fellowship at Harvard, earned a law degree from Yale, received an NAACP Image Award, given talks at schools, prisons, and conferences around the country, been accepted to a PhD program, worked for the New Haven Public Defender's Office, and passed the Connecticut Bar Exam.
Yet on Thursday, Betts was told by the State of Connecticut that he may not have the requisite “character and fitness” to practice law. Having passed the bar​ exam​, Betts received a letter indicating that the state's Bar Examining Committee “has not recommended you for admission to the bar at this time.” The Committee referred Betts to Article VI of its regulations, which provide that “for the protection of the public and the system of justice… a record manifesting a significant deficiency in the honesty, trustworthiness, diligence or reliability of an applicant may constitute a basis for denial of admission.” Betts' felony conviction, from when he was 16 years old nearly 20 years ago, continued to haunt him. The endless list of accomplishments had not been enough. Nothing, apparently, could ever be.
A criminal record follows you around for life. In Devah Pager's formulation, it creates a permanent “mark” upon a person, a stain impossible to get rid of. Once you are marked, you stay marked, and your record will always define you in the eyes of employers, institutions, and society at large. The obstacles to achieving even an ordinary life will be many: finding a job, finding housing, and getting social services will be multiple times more difficult. And as Pager's work documents, that difficulty is multiplied even further if you are black. It has always been true in the United States that being black means you need to be “twice as good” in order to achieve the same level of recognition. But as Betts' case shows, if you have a criminal record, you can even be nine times as good and it might not matter.
It's important to realize just how destructive this is. Every additional difficulty placed in the way of a re-entering offender will discourage people from pursuing the kinds of lives that society ostensibly wants them to lead. ​You can say you want nothing more than for offenders to be rehabilitated, ​for them ​to study hard and work tirelessly and get law degrees​. But​ ​if​ you make it clear when they do these things that​, in fact, ​they're not welcome, fewer people will bother. It has to actually be possible to be fully reaccepted into society for people to attempt to prove that they deserve it.
It's ​also ​worth noting that it was Connecticut that refused to certify Betts' application. Connecticut is, of course, a blue state with reformist impulses, and many of the people on the Bar Examining Committee are almost certainly progressive-minded. But as James Forman documents in Locking Up Our Own, some of the most unforgiving elements of our criminal justice system have been pushed by otherwise-progressive people. Commenting on Betts' case, Forman said: “There are too many people across the political/ideological spectrum who in small, unaccountable, and sometimes even unknowing, ways reinforce mass incarceration's heartlessness.”
The character and fitness portion of the bar admissions process​ has been controversial. Betts isn't the only person to have otherwise-impeccable credentials neutralized by a past criminal offense. Earlier this year, a law student who had won a prestigious Skadden Fellowship had her bar application denied by the State of Washington, due to a previous drug offense. And bar committees have been notorious for invasively inquiring into people's mental health conditions in determining whether to grant licenses. The belief that “character” rather than simply “competence” should determine one's ability to practice law leads bar committees to assume a strangely moralistic role.
But even if we believe that character assessments are generally fair, Betts' case illustrates the disturbing punitiveness of American criminal justice. It's somewhat strange that there should even be consequences that last beyond the length of your sentence; after all, being released is supposed to mean that you have served your time. As Betts said in reaction to the decision, “the question, really, is how long should a prison sentence last… What exactly does society want from me?”
I would hope there's a significant chance that Connecticut will ultimately admit Betts to the bar. It should be a serious embarrassment to them, a public scandal. And Betts will have a greater chance than many people do of getting the Committee to act: his credentials are unusually extensive, and he will have Yale Law School faculty members pulling for him. But one shouldn't have to have superhuman levels of accomplishment in order to erase the presumption of unfit character.
The Bar Examining Committee indicated in its letter to Betts that it would conduct “further review,” though it gave no indication as to what this review might entail or what Betts can do to erase the suspicions​ that hang over him.​ But even if the Connecticut Bar ultimately decides to admit Betts, the message it has sent him is clear: once you are marked a criminal, you are always a criminal.
In our punitive society, that cloud of suspicion will follow you for a lifetime. Every application to anything will go in for “further review” and additional processing. There may have to be a hearing. Everything will need additional references, extra paperwork, layers and layers of small humiliations designed to remind you that even if they let you in, they are making an exception for you rather than ​simply ​recognizing that you meet the requirements. The burden of proof will have permanently shifted against you: you ​start out as a threat, and you have to prove that you aren't. And no matter what you do, no matter how many degrees you earn or Image Awards and letters of recommendation you amass, you will, can never be deemed to have truly paid off your debt. That debt is infinite and it is permanent, and​ nothing​ will ever be enough.

Embed Donald Trump draws crowd of thousands in Alabama 1:49 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
Thousands of people showed up to hear Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump speak at an Alabama rally Friday, in which the business tycoon vowed, "we're going to make America better than it's ever been."
The crowd filled about half of the 43,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile. It was a hot night, and humid. Trump looked upwards and joked: "If it rains, I'll take off my hat and I'll prove, I'll prove, I'll prove once and for all, that it's mine," while stroking his hair.
Trump repeated his tough stance on immigration, vowing "we're going to build a wall," and saying Congress could end the guarantee of being granted citizenship upon being born within the U.S.
"The 14th Amendment — I was right on it. You can do something with it, and you can do something fast," Trump said. "In the case of other countries, including Mexcio, they don't do that. It doesn't work that way. ... We're the only place just about that's stupid enough to do it," he said.

Trump's campaign had pegged the expected attendance at the event at 42,000. They moved Friday's "pep rally" from the city's Civic Center — which seats about 4,000 — to the stadium in anticipation of the huge crowd.
Police and fire officials estimated Friday's crowd at around 20,000.
Stadium is about half filled. Closer to 20,000 rather than the 40,000 campaigns had hoped. Still largest Republican rally yet by far. #trump — Katy Tur (@KatyTurNBC) August 22, 2015
Trump got some of his biggest cheers from the crowd Friday when he pledged to strengthen the military and take care of veterans, and when he extolled his skills as a businessman — while taking a swipe at GOP rival Jeb Bush.
"Who would you rather have negotiated with China, Japan, Mexico, any other: Trump or Bush?" Trump asked. The crowd cheered, and some began to chant "Trump! Trump! Trump!"

Embed Trump Expects Huge Crowds in Alabama Rally 2:25 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog
Trump has been drawing large crowds during stops in key primary states like New Hampshire, animating conservative voters who admire Trump's brand of brash, often personal politics and his draconian proposals to upend the nation's immigration policy.
"The more he speaks on issues — and he's an unfiltered candidate when he speaks — the more he does seem to resonate with folks," said Terry Lathan, the chairwoman of the Alabama Republican Party. "People like straight talkers and he seems to be doing that."
Last weekend, Trump unveiled an immigration blueprint that included the construction of a continuous border wall, the deportation of the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants and the ending of birthright citizenship for children born on U.S. soil to parents in the country illegally.
Alabama, which will hold its presidential primary along with a slate of other southern states on March 1, 2016, could be particularly fertile ground for Trump's message.
In spring 2011, the state enacted the nation's harshest law to crack down on illegal immigration, including a provision requiring police to detain anyone suspected of being in the country illegally if the person was unable to produce proper documentation. The law also included a provision requiring public schools to determine the immigration status of students.
But a series of lawsuits swiftly resulted in the halting of many of the law's key provisions, which opponents decried as blatantly unconstitutional. By October, the state reached a settlement agreement that effectively gutted the measure.
The state's Hispanic population was about 4.1 percent in 2013, according to Census figures. But that number has been growing. Between 2000-2012, Alabama was one of the five states nationwide with the fastest growth of its Hispanic population, which grew 157 percent over the 12 year period.
Alabama is also heavily conservative, backing Mitt Romney by 61 percent over Barack Obama's 38 percent in the 2012 presidential election.
Trump's appearance in the state is intended to build support as the Republican field courts the southern voters who will weigh in on the primary contest shortly after key states like Iowa and New Hampshire.
But Gov. Robert Bentley, who signed the controversial 2011 immigration measure into law, is backing a different Republican for the 2016 race.
Earlier this week, Bentley backed fellow Republican Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, highlighting Kasich's compassion and commitment to helping all Americans.
"We need someone who believes in the promise of our great country," Bentley said in his endorsement. "Someone who believes our country can be better and stronger and safer not only for those of us who maybe have a little bit more but those of us who in this country who need to be taken care of. ...It doesn't matter whether or not you're the same race, it doesn't matter if you're the same economic status. We need a leader who cares about the people."
Ready for some good news about the environment? Emissions of carbon dioxide in the United States are declining. But don't celebrate just yet. A major side effect of that cleaner air in the U.S. has been the further darkening of skies over Europe and Asia.
The United States essentially is exporting a share of its greenhouse gas emissions in the form of coal, data show. If the trend continues, the dramatic changes in energy use in the United States—in particular, the switch from coal to newly abundant natural gas for generating electricity—will have only a modest impact on global warming, observers warn. The Earth's atmosphere will continue to absorb heat-trapping CO2, with a similar contribution from U.S. coal. It will simply be burned overseas instead of at home.
"Switching from coal to gas only saves carbon if the coal stays in the ground," said John Broderick, lead author of a study on the issue by the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research at England's Manchester University. (Related Quiz: "What You Don't Know About Electricity")
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released data this week showing that United States coal exports hit a record 126 million short tons in 2012, a 17 percent increase over the previous year. Overseas shipments surpassed the previous high mark set in 1981 by 12 percent. The United States clearly is using less coal: Domestic consumption fell by about 114 million tons, or 11 percent, largely due to a decline in the use of coal for electricity. But U.S. coal production fell just 7 percent. The United States, with the world's largest coal reserves, continued to churn out the most carbon-intensive fuel, producing 1 billion tons of coal from its mines in 2012.
Emissions Sink
The EIA estimates that due largely to the drop in coal-fired electricity, U.S. carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel declined 3.4 percent in 2012. If the numbers hold up, it will extend the downward trend that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) outlined last month in its annual greenhouse gas inventory, which found greenhouse gas emissions in 2011 had fallen 8 percent from their 2007 peak to 6,703 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (a number that includes sources other than energy, like methane emissions from agriculture). In fact, if you don't count the recession year of 2009, U.S. emissions in 2011 dropped to their lowest level since 1995.
President Barack Obama counted the trend among his environmental accomplishments in his State of the Union address last month: "Over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen."
The reason is clear: Coal, which in 2005 generated 50 percent of U.S. electricity, saw its share erode to 37.4 percent in 2012, according to EIA's new short-term energy outlook. An increase in U.S. renewable energy certainly played a role; renewables climbed in those seven years from 8.7 percent to 13 percent of the energy mix, about half of its hydropower. But the big gain came from natural gas, which climbed from 19 percent to 30.4 percent of U.S. electricity during that time frame, primarily because of abundant supply and low prices made possible by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. (Related: "Natural Gas Stirs Hope and Fear in Pennsylvania" and interactive, "Breaking Fuel From the Rock")
The trend appears on track to continue, with U.S. coal-fired plants being retired at a record pace.
But U.S. coal producers haven't been standing still as their domestic market has evaporated. They've been shipping their fuel to energy-hungry markets overseas, from the ports of Norfolk, Baltimore, and New Orleans. Although demand is growing rapidly in Asia—U.S. coal exports to China were on track to double last year—Europe was the biggest customer, importing more U.S. coal last year than all other countries combined. The Netherlands, with Europe's largest port, Rotterdam, accepted the most shipments, on pace for a 24 jump in U.S. coal imports in 2012. The United Kingdom, the second largest customer, saw its U.S. coal imports jump more than 70 percent. (Related: "Natural Gas A Weak Weapon Against Climate Change, Study Says")
The hike in European coal consumption would appear to run counter to big government initiatives across the Continent to cut CO2 emissions. But in the European Union, where fracking has made only its initial forays and natural gas is still expensive, American coal is, well, dirt cheap. (Related: "U.K. Dash for Gas a Test for Global Fracking")
European utilities are now finding that generating power from coal is a profitable gambit. In the power industry, the profit margin for generating electricity from coal is called the "clean dark spread"; at the end of December in Great Britain, it was going for about $39 per megawatt-hour, according to Argus. By contrast, the profit margin for gas-fired plants—the "clean spark spread"—was about $3. Tomas Wyns, director of the Center for Clean Air Policy-Europe, a nonprofit organization in Brussels, Belgium, said those kinds of spreads are typical across Europe right now.
The EU has a cap-and-trade carbon market, the $148 billion, eight-year-old Emissions Trading System (ETS). But it's in the doldrums because of a huge oversupply of permits. That's caused the price of carbon to fall to about 4 euros ($5.23). A plan called "backloading" that would temporarily extract allowances from the market to shore up the price has faltered so far in the European Parliament. "A better carbon price could make a difference" and even out the coal and gas spreads, Wyns said. He estimates a price of between 20 and 40 euros would do the trick. "But a structural change to the Emissions Trading System is not something that will happen very quickly. A solution is years off."
The Tyndall Center study estimates that the burning of all that exported coal could erase fully half the gains the United States has made in reducing carbon emissions. For huge reserves of shale gas to help cut CO2 emissions, "displaced fuels must be reduced globally and remain suppressed indefinitely," the report said. (Related Quiz: "What You Don't Know About Natural Gas")
Future Emissions
It is not clear that the surge in U.S. coal exports will continue. One reason for the uptick in coal-fired generation in Europe has been the looming deadline for the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive, which will require older coal plants to meet lower emission levels by the end of 2015 or be mothballed. Before that phaseout begins, Wyns says, "there is a bit of a binge going on."
Also, economic factors are at work. Tyndall's Broderick said American coal companies have been essentially selling surplus fuel overseas at low profit margins, so there is a likelihood that U.S. coal production will decrease further. The U.S. government forecasters at EIA expect that U.S. coal exports will fall back to about 110 million tons per year over the next two years, due to economic weakness in Europe, falling international prices, and competition from other coal-exporting countries. The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) calls Europe's "coal renaissance" a temporary phenomenon; it forecasts an increasing use of renewables, shuttering of coal plants, and a better balance between gas and coal prices in the coming years.
But IEA does not expect that the global appetite for coal will slacken appreciably. The agency projects that, by 2017, coal will rival oil as the world's primary energy source, mainly because of skyrocketing demand in Asia. (Related: "Pictures: A Rare Look Inside China's Energy Machine")
U.S. coal producers have made clear that they aim to tap into that growing market.
Currently, U.S. exports to Asia are somewhat constrained because there is little port capacity for big coal ships on the U.S. West Coast, and because metallurgical coal, the high-heat content rock that is used for steelmaking, is mined exclusively on the U.S. East Coast. Nevertheless, demand for U.S. "met" coal is so great in Asia that the shipments make a round-the-world journey from Appalachia. They are sent by train to the port of Baltimore, where they steam to sea through the Chesapeake Bay, then south across the Atlantic Ocean and around Africa's Cape of Good Hope to reach Asian ports.
Whether U.S. exports to Asia expand will depend largely on the fate of controversial proposals to expand port capacity in Bellingham and Longview, Washington, and Corpus Christi, Texas. (Related: "Seeking a Pacific Northwest Gateway for U.S. Coal" ) Those new ports would allow easier transport of the abundant coal of the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana, which is especially well suited for generating electricity. Powder River Basin coal is prized because it is low in sulfur and can cut acid rain emissions, but as with all coal, carbon dioxide emissions remain a major problem.
John Eaves, chief executive officer of St. Louis, Missouri-based Arch Coal, which saw the bulk of its exports last year go to South Korea, told investors last month that the company would be proactive in working to gain greater port capacity. Despite the low price currently fetched for coal overseas, Eaves said the company expects the international market to improve even as domestic demand for coal recedes. "As we look to the U.S. over the next three to five years, let's face it, demand's going to be pretty flat," he said. "We see exports as a long-term development opportunity."

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Sept. 4 (UPI) -- Shocked Google users took to social media after discovering the "direct answers" service gives an anti-Semetic response to the question, "Who runs Hollywood?"
The "direct answers" service, which uses an infobox to share information from websites to answer the questions posed to the search engine by users, was found to be bringing up the answer "Jews" when asked about "who runs Hollywood."
The infobox contains information from a July 14 article in the New Observer, a website that purports to be "designed to present current affairs without the spin of the controlled media."
A Google representative told The Guardian that technicians were working to remove the offending answer.
"We assure you that the views expressed by such sites are not in any way endorsed by Google," the representative said.
Google said the search engine's page-rank algorithm gave the New Observer article "authority" due to the high number links to the site from other users.
The "Jews" answer was still being given by the search engine early Friday morning, but it had been removed by 11:30 a.m.
Don't be surprised if you see some familiar esports faces the next time you watch CBS' "Elementary."
The Elementary Writers Twitter account revealed earlier this week that some major esports stars will be making cameo appearances in the shows' esports-centric episode on Feb. 19.
The players you may recognize will include Team EnVy Us Call of Duty pro Jordan "JKap" Kaplan, Optic Gaming's CS:GO player Tarik "tarik" Celik, FGC veteran Arturo "TS Sabin" Sanchez, and Super Smash Bros. Melee players Hendrick "DJ Nintendo" Pilar and Misfits' Ryan "The Moon" Coker-Welch.
"I feel really excited being a special guest on Elementary. Never been on TV and this is a great way to give more exposure to the esports community," said The Moon to ESPN.com.
This all-star cast from various games will cameo as players on a fictional team. In the episode, present-day Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, played by Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu respectively, tackle the murder of a fictional Canadian esports up-and-comer.
"I read some articles about the emerging pro esports scene and came across some on teams poaching other teams' best players," said Elementary writer and producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe to ESPN. Wolfe wrote the idea on a card and kept it on ice for the better part of a year.
"I continued to research the area over that year as well," Wolfe added. "I also watch live streams and YouTube vids for games I play myself and think that's a fun world. So that was another card: Murder on a live stream. The ideas seemed like they'd go nicely together."
That's when writer and producer Jeffrey Paul King chimed in. He mentioned the idea of bringing in actual esports players. King has been involved with the Super Smash Bros. community, and he worked on the Cultivation Leffen documentary with Team SoloMid and Red Bull, covering Melee player William "Leffen" Hjelte.
All the players will be playing a fantasy lane-pusher type game, similar to League of Legends or DotA 2.
"We tried to get a real game, but, for legal reasons, we couldn't go there," Wolfe said.
Whenever a show tackles niche communities, there's always a fear that representations can come off as unflattering. And Wolfe admitted there is a concern to ensure the show is approachable for people outside of esports.
"I definitely don't want it to seem stereotyped or tacky," Wolfe said. That's one of the main reasons he was excited to bring on actual players.
But don't expect to actually see the players act.
"We had one speaking role we'd hope to use a real player or live streamer for, but acting is a very specific skillset and we didn't have any luck finding anyone who could pull it off," Wolfe said. "So yeah, the players will be playing [on] an esport team, Team ProFine, practicing for an upcoming tournament in their team house."
For fans, the episode will be littered with esports references.
"Their real-life tags are on the backs of the shirts we made for them for the episode," King said. And according to Dot Esports, references will also be made to Melee's Evil Geniuses' Kevin "PPMD" Nanney, BOXR's Julian "Zhu" Zhu, Leffen, and Halo player for Str8 Rippin Richie "Heinz" Heinz.
"Filming was amazing. We got to see behind the scenes and how they take different camera angles. Had to do a lot of re-dos, but it was worth it," said The Moon.
In an earlier episode, references were made to Team Liquid's Juan "Hungrybox" Debiedma and Team Secret's Otto "Silent Wolf" Bisno. The upcoming esports episode will also include the writer's personal references to their own Runequest and World of Warcraft tags. It goes without saying: The writers on "Elementary" like video games.
Esports continue to gain mainstream popularity. Many professional teams are seeing investment from the likes of Shaquille O'Neal, Mark Cuban, Rick Fox and Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens. Capcom Cup, a Street Fighter V tournament, was recently aired on ESPN2, and the Disney Channel's "Gaming Show" brought on Counter-Logic Gaming's Tyrell "Nakat" Coleman and Richard "Keitaro" King Jr. As for the future of esports on television, Wolfe doesn't have grand aspirations at the moment, saying, "We just wanted to introduce our audience to esports in general."
Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe has vetoed legislation that would allow people to carry concealed switchblades and a bill that would allow home-schooled students to participate in public-school sports.
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe has vetoed legislation that would allow people to carry concealed switchblades and a bill that would allow home-schooled students to participate in public-school sports.
The governor announced the vetoes Monday. He also vetoed a bill that would lower the allowable age of conceal handgun permit holders from 21 to 18 for active duty military members and veterans.
McAuliffe vetoed a similar school sports bill last year, saying it would create an uneven playing field. The so-called “Tebow bill” is named for Tim Tebow, the former NFL quarterback who was home-schooled and allowed to play football for his local high school.
Though Republicans control both chambers of the General Assembly, they do not have enough votes to overturn McAuliffe's vetoes.

The best footballer to ever represent the United States men's national team is reportedly weighing the option of running for office.
According to Sports Illustrated's Grant Wahl, Landon Donovan is mulling a run for U.S. Soccer president. The USMNT's joint-top scorer is apparently being asked by respected figures within American soccer to contemplate running, as they're concerned about Sunil Gulati continuing to control technical decisions - including the hiring of head coaches - and believe the ex-footballer is qualified to handle the job.
After the USMNT suffered a humiliating 2-1 defeat in Trinidad and Tobago and failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Gulati announced that he won't resign as U.S. Soccer president and refused to rule out running for re-election. The next election takes place in February.
"I don't plan to resign ... it's not the right day for me to talk about my personal future plans in terms of the fed' presidency," Gulati said last Friday.
Gulati, U.S. Soccer president since 2006, ran unopposed in three campaigns, but will be challenged by Steve Gans, founder of Professional Soccer Advisors, as well as Paul Lapointe, manager of the United Soccer League's Northeast Conference. Eric Wynalda, who played for the USMNT, is also contemplating a run.
Guidelines stipulate that Gulati is only allowed to serve one more term.
After receiving criticism for giving little coverage to the devastating earthquake in Haiti, Fox News' three top-rated programs for 2009 devoted scant coverage to the disaster for a second night -- a combined total of 20 minutes and 40 seconds on January 14 -- while MSNBC's three top-rated shows devoted more than an hour and 45 minutes to discussing Haiti. The vast majority of the coverage on Fox's top-rated shows aired on The O'Reilly Factor; Beck's and Hannity's shows each aired less than four minutes of coverage of the disaster.
MSNBC's top programs again devote significantly more time to discussing aftermath of earthquake in Haiti
The O'Reilly Factor, Hannity, and Glenn Beck, Fox News' three top-rated programs for 2009, combined to devote a total of 20 minutes and 40 seconds of coverage to the earthquake in Haiti and its aftermath. Among the things Beck discussed instead of the earthquake were Senate majority leader Harry Reid's controversial comments; Hannity discussed the possibility that Republican candidate Scott Brown could win a special election for Massachusetts' U.S. Senate seat. Countdown, The Rachel Maddow Show, and Hardball, MSNBC's three top-rated shows, devoted 1 hour, 45 minutes, and 27 seconds to the earthquake -- more than five times the coverage aired by Fox News' top three shows.
A Media Matters study previously showed that Fox News' top-rated shows devoted less than seven minutes of coverage to discussing the earthquake on January 13, compared to MSNBC, which underscored the significance of the disaster in Haiti by devoting a total of more than two hours to the earthquake on its top-rated shows.
The Tata Nano was a compact city car manufactured and marketed by Indian automaker Tata Motors over a single generation, primarily in India, as an inexpensive rear-engined hatchback intended to appeal to current riders of motorcycles and scooters — with a launch price of one lakh rupees or US$2500 in the year 2008.[5]
Numerous factors led to the decline of sales volume, including delays during the factory relocation from Singur to Sanand, early instances of the Nano catching fire, the perception of the car being unsafe and lacking quality due to cost cutting. Tata Motors projected production of 250,000 annually at launch, actually achieving sales in of 7591 for model year 2016-17. The project lost money for Tata, confirmed by former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry and confirmed by current Tata Motors management.[6][7]
In 2017, Tata Motors said manufacture would continue due to the Tata's emotional commitment to the project, despite poor market demand.[8][9] In 2018, Cyrus Mistry, Chair of the Tata Group, called the Tata Nano a failed project, with production ending in May 2018.[10]
History [ edit ]
After successfully launching the low-cost Tata Ace truck in 2005, Tata Motors began development of an affordable car that would appeal to the many Indians who ride motorcycles.[11] The purchase price of this no frills auto was brought down by dispensing with most nonessential features, reducing the amount of steel used in its construction, and relying on low-cost Indian labour.[citation needed]. The nonessential features include, removal of the passenger's side wing mirror, having one wiper blade, having only three lug nuts per wheel, removal of the fuel filler cap from the fuel tank and not having air conditioning [12].
The introduction of the Nano received much media attention due to its low price of 1 lakh rupees (Rs. 100,000).[13]
Expectations and effects [ edit ]
Expectations created for the car during the run up to its production may have been out of proportion with its realised success. A 2008 study, by Indian rating agency CRISIL, thought the Nano would expand the nation's car market by 65%,[14] but, as of late 2012, news reports have detailed the underwhelming response of the Indian consumer to the offering; sales in the first two fiscal years after the car's unveiling remained steady at about 70,000 units although Tata appears intent on maintaining a capacity to produce the car in much larger quantities, some 250,000 per year, should the need arise.[15]
It was anticipated that its 2009 debut would greatly affect the used car market, and prices did drop 25–30% prior to the launch.[16] Sales of the Nano's nearest competitor, the Maruti 800, fell by 20% immediately following the unveiling of the Nano.[17] It is unknown if the Nano has had a lasting effect on the prices of and demand for close substitutes. In July 2012, Tata's Group chairman Ratan Tata, who retired in January 2014, said that the car had immense potential in the developing world while admitting that early opportunities were wasted due to initial problems.[18] Due to the sales drops, only a single unit was produced in June 2018.
Singur factory pullout [ edit ]
Tata Motors announced in 2006 that the Nano would be manufactured in Singur, West Bengal.[19] Local farmers soon began protesting the forced acquisition of their land the new factory entailed.[19] Tata first delayed the Nano launch and later decided to build the car in a different state, Gujarat, instead.[20]
Price [ edit ]
Rear
Announced as the most affordable production car in the world, Tata aimed for a price of one lakh rupees, or ₹100,000, which was approximately $2,000 US at the time.[21] Only the very first customers were able to purchase the car at that price, and as of 2017, the price for the basic Nano starts around ₹ 215,000.[22] Increasing material costs may be to blame for this rapid rise in price.[23]
Compared to the Volkswagen Beetle it had a relatively low price, though still high in terms of the average salary of an Indian industrial worker / farmer. In 1990, a Beetle from Mexican factories was priced at $5,300,[24] about $10,164 in today's money. The Ford Model T's initial price was about $850, equivalent to $23,702 today.[25] The price of the Nano was only just higher than the corrected price of the Briggs & Stratton Flyer of the 1910s, with the Flyer costing US$125 ($1,767 in 2016), even though the Flyer would today hardly be considered more than a go-kart.
The original Nano is not street legal in the US, and cannot legally be sold as a grey market import until 2034, when the original 2009 models receive a 25-year exemption from the US Customs and Border Protection.[26] Despite a readily-available dealership network in the US through the Jaguar Land Rover division of Tata, Tata Motors did not use Jaguar Land Rover to sell the Nano.[27]
Cost-cutting features [ edit ]
The Nano's design implements many measures to reduce manufacturing costs.

Technical specifications [ edit ]
The Nano (2012) was a 38 PS (28 kW; 37 hp) car with a two-cylinder 624 cc engine mounted in the rear of the car. The car complied with Bharat Stage 4 Indian Emissions Standards, which are roughly equivalent to Euro 4.
The development of the Nano led to 31 design and 37 technology patents being filed.

Tata GenX Nano (2015-2018) [ edit ]
2015 Tata GenX Nano (facelift)
In May 2015, to revive the model's sales, Tata Motors proposed a redesign both inside and outside the car: the name was changed to GenX Nano to underline the changes, the range was offered in 21 different versions and a 5-speed semi-automatic transmission was introduced.[34] Electric power steering, air conditioning, and Bluetooth radio were available on top models in addition to new colors and new alloy wheels. The body was strengthened and the front and rear bumpers were also changed, which slightly increased the length to 3,164 centimeters. The interior was also redesigned with new fabrics and improved soundproofing of the model. The rear opening door and the 5-seat homologation were also introduced. The engine remained the 2-cylinder 624 cc (38.1 cu in) with 38 hp.[35][36]
Alternative powerplants [ edit ]
The Nano was driven by a petrol engine. Though several variants were proposed, none were put into production. An upscale version was shown at an autoshow.
Compressed-air engine [ edit ]
Tata Motors signed an agreement in 2007 with a French firm, Motor Development International, to produce a compressed air car Nano.[37] While the vehicle was supposed to be able to travel approximately 200 kilometres (120 mi) on $3 US of electricity to compress the air, Tata's Vice-President of Engineering Systems confirmed in late 2009 that vehicle range continued to be a problem.[37][38]
Electric vehicle [ edit ]
Tata discussed the possibility of producing an electric version,[39] and while it showcased an electric vehicle Nano at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show,[40] no such car came onto the market.
If an EV Nano had been produced the expectations were that it would have been a highly affordable electric car[41] using lithium-ion batteries and having a range of 80 miles (130 km).[42] A Norwegian electric car specialist, Miljøbil Grenland AS, was named as a proposed partner in the project.[39]
Tata Nano CNG emax (Bi-fuel) [ edit ]
The Nano CNG emax was launched in October 2013. It could run on either gasoline or compressed natural gas. Initially, it was to be sold in Delhi and parts of Maharashtra and Lucknow, where CNG was available at fuel outlets.[43] The bifuel engine was powered by both CNG and petrol. In natural gas operation, the engine delivered maximum power of 33 horsepower and 45 Nm of maximum torque. The tank had a capacity of 32 liters of CNG.[44]
Tata Super Nano [ edit ]
In December 2014, Coimbatore-based JA Motorsport presented a 230 hp 1.3-liter engined version of the Nano called the 'Super Nano' at the Autocar Performance Show. Featuring a full body kit, slick tyres, a bolt-on roll cage, and smoked head and taillamps, the Super Nano featured carbon fibre components, Recaro seats, and steering-mounted paddle shifters.[45]
European export [ edit ]
An upscale Nano concept car called Nano Europa was shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show.[46] However, there was no progress towards producing or marketing this upscale specification.
Car fires [ edit ]
There were reports of several fire incidents involving the Nano.[47] The company denied those were connected to the car's design or its parts and blamed "foreign electrical equipment" found on top of the exhaust system.[47] The company offered to retrofit the exhaust and electrical systems but refused to recall the cars.[47] Tata extended the warranty on the car, including those already sold, from 18 months to four years in early December 2010.[47]
Reception [ edit ]
The Nano received a mixed reception from Indian consumers; reasons given included that it was still too expensive compared to a motorcycle, and the extended waiting time for delivery (a few months).[48] Although it was identified as the most affordable car,[49] a secondhand car that was more expensive when it was new gave more social status; the Nano was considered a "poor man's" vehicle, turning some people away.[50] The fires and other safety issues were also a concern.[48]
Tata Motors ended FY16 selling 21,012 Nanos, up from 16,901 in FY15.[51]
Crash safety [ edit ]
In 2014, a Nano was crashed for NCAP by ADAC in Germany. Despite Tata's claim that it was expecting 4 stars, the Nano got no stars for lack of adult protection and did not meet basic UN safety requirements. It also lacked airbags.[52][53]
Sales [ edit ]
At the time of launch Tata Motors planned to sell 250,000 units per year. The maximum sales ever achieved was 74,527 units during FY 2011-2012 and then sales declined rapidly year on year leading to a negligible market share of the car in the "A" segment. The product was expected to be phased out soon as dealers stopped placing orders.[54][55]
FY 2009–2010 30,000 approx[56]
FY 2010–2011 70,432[56]
FY 2011–2012 74,527[56]
FY 2012–2013 53,848[57]
FY 2013–2014 21,129[58]
FY 2014–2015 16,903[59]
FY 2016-2017 7,591[60]
FY 2017-2018 April - October 1,502
End of production [ edit ]
Due to the low sales of the model (only one Nano was assembled in June 2018 against the 275 assembled in June 2017) Tata Motors announced the end of production without any direct successor. The Nano was never really appreciated by the public and sales were always lower than expected.[61]

After graduating from school I despaired of finding a job and applied instead for unpaid internships, landing at The Paris Review, a literary magazine in Manhattan. I read through the slush pile, learned how to fact-check and performed light janitorial tasks, like emptying the dishwasher and taking out the trash. It was a fine four months. My parents lived in the city, so I didn't have to pay rent; the editors were kind, smart people who seemed appropriately embarrassed by the trash situation.
Such experiences are common. Ross Perlin, the author of “Intern Nation,” estimated in 2011 that between one and two million people participate in internships each year in the United States, and that as many as half of internships are unpaid or paid below the minimum wage.
Employers see nothing wrong with soliciting free labor on public forums. This month, a high-level editor at Lean In, the foundation Sheryl Sandberg started to help women “pursue their ambitions,” tried using Facebook to find a “part-time, unpaid” intern “with editorial and social chops” as well as “Web skills.” After an uproar — how could Lean In, of all places, lean on interns? — the foundation president promised to set up a more formal internship program, with compensation.
Unpaid internships are, at best, ethically iffy. A necessary precursor to jobs in certain fields, they act as both a gateway and a barrier to entry. Young people believe they have no choice. Anyone unable to forgo pay risks being shut out.

Make no doubt about it — our country is moving forward to create safer spaces for all people, and our efforts have grown to include our lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender brothers, sisters and friends. But as America progresses, Mississippi is falling back.
Hours before the Supreme Court decided to take on marriage equality cases, violent graffiti that called for the deaths of LGBT Americans was found on the wall of a downtown Jackson building. On the same Tuesday night President Obama called marriage a civil right for the very first time and referenced lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in his State of the Union address, the Starkville Board of Alderman callously repealed a LGBT-inclusive resolution that had served to welcome and affirm all Starkville residents, and took away their health benefits in one fell legislative swoop. In Rankin County, students at a high school who wanted to organize a club to provide much-needed support for LGBT students were stymied by prejudice, leaders at the school voting purposefully to stop the club from forming and saying that they “wanted to limit organizations … on campus that we don't want to endorse and don't want.”
What does this mean? It means that LGBT Mississippians remain subject to laws and attitudes that devalue their very personhood. It means a state longing to move forward is being pulled back by so-called leaders who put enmity ahead of equality. It means our dream of a better future for all of us has been delayed once again.
But what has happened in Mississippi over the past few weeks doesn't paint a true picture of the Magnolia State. Mississippians know sexual orientation or gender identity shouldn't matter when it comes to working hard and taking care of your neighbor. Mississippians know all children are valued, no matter who they are. And Mississippians know that above all, treating one another with dignity and respect is what counts.
The fight for basic civil rights is not a quest for superiority or an unvoiced desire for power. It is, at its root, a battle to raise us all up. We all deserve the right to try and fail, move forward and fall back, and ultimately succeed on our own merits and individual gifts. But for many of us, our ability to dream of a greater and more brilliant future is limited by the color of our skin, the texts of our religious tomes, and the gender of whom we love and who we are.
The push for full equality for all Americans has always come with hurdles and setbacks. But we are not dissuaded from our path. LGBT Mississippians and their families yearn for a better day, one that we can work together to create. Let's begin right now.

GRAND CANYON, Ariz. — National parks such as the Grand Canyon are protective harbors for some of the last remaining dark skies in this country. Stargazers can take advantage of this fact from June 4-11 as part of the 26th annual Grand Canyon Star Party on the South and North rims of the park. This is one of many special events going on in national parks across the country in this centennial year of the National Park Service.
This year's event honors Joe Orr, a Grand Canyon Star Party enthusiast and protector of Grand Canyon's skies who died in 2013. Amateur astronomers from across the country will volunteer their telescopes and expertise for the enjoyment of park visitors.
Astronomers and rangers will present free slide programs, and numerous telescopes will offer views of planets Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, as well as double stars, star clusters, nebulae and distant galaxies and the Moon later in the week. By day, keep an eye out for solar telescopes pointed at the sun. Weather permitting, expect spectacular views of the universe.
South Rim events
On the South Rim, events include a nightly slide show at 8 p.m. in the theater of the Grand Canyon Visitor Center, followed by free telescope viewing behind the building. Green-laser Constellation Tours will be offered at 9 p.m., 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m.
Parking is recommended in lots 1 through 4, or visitors can use the free Village Route shuttle bus, which runs until 11 p.m. To guarantee a seat at the slide show, arrive early; doors open at 7:40 p.m. With the best opportunities for seeing the night sky taking place after 9 p.m, telescope viewing continues well into the night, and visitors may arrive any time after dark.
A flashlight is recommended for the walk to the viewing area, but white lights are not permitted on the Telescope Lot. Give your eyes time to dark-adapt, or use a red flashlight — easily constructed by covering any flashlight with red cellophane, nail polish or permanent marker.
North Rim events
On the North Rim, astronomers will set up telescopes on the terrace of the Grand Canyon Lodge every evening. Astronomers will also use green lasers to point out constellations. An astronomy slide show will be presented at 8:30 p.m. nightly in the lodge auditorium. By day, look for solar telescopes on the terrace and elsewhere. Check the visitor center and park bulletin boards for program topics and additional details.
Expect cool nighttime temperatures on both rims, even in summer. Those attending the Star Party are encouraged to bring warm layers of clothing. When traveling in the park on the South Rim, it is best to find a parking space and use the free shuttle bus system to access points of interest in the Grand Canyon Village area. For shuttle bus information, visit the South Rim shuttle bus web page.
The Grand Canyon Star Party is sponsored by the National Park Service, the Tucson Amateur Astronomy Association (South Rim) and the Saguaro Astronomy Club of Phoenix (North Rim), with funding from Grand Canyon Association and in partnership with the International Dark-Sky Association.

President Trump hit his 100th day in office on Saturday, with the White House claiming they've accomplished more in the opening stretch than any president since Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Fox News took a look at the stats, and broke down the first 100 days by the numbers. From meetings with foreign leaders to golf outings to a flurry of executive orders, here's what Trump has done in his first 100 days:
Signed 28 bills and resolutions into law
The White House says Trump has signed more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman. It's technically true; Trump signed 28 bills and resolutions into law in his first 100 days, though they generally were not major pieces of legislation. Thirteen of the 28 bills signed were done under the Congressional Review Act to roll back Obama-era regulations.
Here are the other 15 bills Trump signed into law:
? Jan. 20—signed S.84, a bill to allow the appointment of someone for secretary of defense who has not been retired from the Armed Forces for at least seven years. Gen. Jim Mattis had only been retired for three years, requiring a waiver from Congress in order to be confirmed for the Cabinet post—Trump signed this on Inauguration Day.
? Jan. 31—signed H.R.72, the GAO Access and Oversight Act of 2017, which authorized the Government Accountability Office to obtain federal agency records required to discharge GAO duties.

? March 21—signed S. 442, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act.
? March 28—signed S. 305, the Vietnam War Veterans Recognition Act.
? March 31—signed H.R. 1362, a bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa, the “Faleomavaega Eni Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA Clinic.”
? March 31—signed S.J. Res 1, a joint resolution to approve the location of a memorial to commemorate and honor members of Armed Forces who served in active duty in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield.
? April 3—signed H.R. 1228, a bill to allow the appointment of members of the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance to replace members whose terms expire during 2017.
? April 18—signed H.R. 353, the Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act.
? April 19---signed S. 544, a bill to amend Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to change the termination date for the Veterans Choice Program.
? April 19—signed S.J. Res 30, a joint resolution to reappoint Steve Case as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents for the Smithsonian Institution.
? April 19—signed S.J. Res 35, a joint resolution to appoint Michael Govan as a citizen regent of the Board of Regents for the Smithsonian Institution.
? April 19—signed S.J. Res 36, a joint resolution to appoint Roger Ferguson as a citizen regent of Board of Regents for the Smithsonian Institution.
Signed 30 executive orders
Trump signed 30 executive orders in his first 100 days. By comparison, during their first 100 days, President Barack Obama signed 19, George W. Bush signed 11, and Bill Clinton signed 13. The last time any president came close to Trump in signed orders was President Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed 26.

Last week I mentioned that the lawsuit (if you can call it that) filed against me, the President of the United States, and a number of other dignitaries by birther/dentist/lawyer Dr. Orly Taitz had been dismissed. I also mentioned having seen a chart purporting to list every court ruling in the many cases that have challenged Obama's claim to be a "natural born citizen," and based on that I suggested that Taitz's record in court on these cases was 0-158. I heard from the person who compiles that chart, who kindly gave me permission to link to it, and after reviewing it again I need to make a couple of corrections.
First, it may not be correct to ascribe all these losses to Orly Taitz. Certainly there are other people involved in filing these things, including Keith Judd, who I mentioned here in a slightly different context, although a context that also involved him being in prison, and also Philip Berg, who I mentioned here. None of these people have ever won a single victory in their "birther" lawsuits, nor has anyone else, and it's also entirely possible that Taitz is involved in some or all of these other cases behind the scenes. But to be strictly accurate, while Taitz is zero-and-something, it may not be zero-and-158.
Second, the overall record is significantly worse than I thought, according to the "Birther Scorecard."
This chart, which is currently 70 pages long and lists 175 cases, includes short summaries and also links to almost all the cited orders, where they are available online. It's an impressive piece of work, created by Tesibria at What's Your Evidence? According to the Scorecard (last updated October 18), of the 175 cases she thinks can be fairly classified as "birther" cases, birthers have lost 166 and the remaining nine are still pending.
If you add up all the individual rulings, including those in appellate courts and the U.S. Supreme Court, the birther's arguments have been rejected (or appeals denied) at least 258 times.
As a bonus for me personally, I think I've also gotten at least one new entry for the Comical Case Names page from this, because one of these people apparently insists on filing cases as "Annamarie Last Name Uncertain." Not "Annamarie Doe" or something like that—as this court noted, "In her pleadings, Plaintiff indicates that her first name is Annamarie and that her last name is uncertain." But the captions actually read Annamarie Last Name Uncertain vs. [Whoever]. Nicely done, Ms. LNU.
In general I support the rights of the uncertain, but nobody seems able to even figure out what this person wants.
Boston outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury won the American League award. The honors were announced Thursday, and were picked by the 30 team beat reporters from MLB.com.
Berkman was not in the lineup in Game F4 of the NL championship series on Thursday night, given his lifetime 3 for 32 showing against Milwaukee starter Randy Wolf.
Berkman also had a bruise on right hip after being hit by a pitch in Wednesday's 4-3 win over Milwaukee, and manager Tony La Russa said it was a good time to give him a day off. The Cardinals led 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.
The switch-hitter ranked in the top 10 in the NL in homers (tied for ninth), walks (fourth with 92), slugging percentage (fifth at .547) and on-base percentage (third with .412).
An injured left knee played a big role in Berkman's struggles in 2010, when the career .296 hitter batted .248 with just 14 homers and 58 RBIs in splitting time with the Astros and Yankees. Some believed that Berkman, now 35, was on the downhill side of his career.
"I wasn't thinking that I had to come back and prove people wrong," Berkman said. "That wasn't my attitude at all."
Berkman shed about 20 pounds over the winter while working with a personal trainer. In addition to a strong season at the plate, he was respectable in the outfield after playing most first base in recent seasons. He was a key player in the Cardinals' remarkable run to the wild-card playoff spot after trailing Atlanta by 10½ games in late August.
"He's just been a great player for our team," La Russa said.
Berkman said it was actually the 2010 playoffs when he realized his career was far from over. Berkman was 5 for 16 (.313) with a homer and four RBIs combined in the Yankees' divisional series win over Minnesota and ALCS loss to Texas.
"That playoff experience last year was kind of what set me off in the offseason feeling like, all right, I can get back to swing the bat like I know I can," he said.
Berkman had long been a Cardinals nemesis in his 11-plus seasons in Houston. After years of battling the Cardinals in the NL Central, St. Louis was one of the few places where he wanted to extend his career. In fact, he contacted the Cardinals in the offseason to see if they were interested in signing him.
"Just the fit seemed perfect for me, just knowing those guys and coming over here, everything I thought it would be," Berkman said. "I felt like I fit in pretty quick."
It worked out so well the Cardinals have already re-signed Berkman for 2012.
The 28-year-old Ellsbury played just 18 games in 2010 because of injuries and hit only .192.
Ellsbury came back as a force this season. He set career highs in most offensive categories, hitting .321 with 32 home runs, 105 RBIs, 46 doubles, five triples, 119 runs and 39 stolen bases.
He became the first Boston player to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in a season and led the major leagues with 364 total bases and 83 extra-base hits. He was third in the AL with 212 hits, and tied for third in runs and doubles.
In a post made on his Twitter page Thursday afternoon, Ellsbury said he was grateful to receive the award.
"CB Player of the Year...tremendous honor. Thanks to writers who voted for me, my teammates and fans," he wrote.
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.
Proteus, one of 2013's most interesting indie titles, is getting virtual reality (VR) support by way of the Oculus Rift VR headset. It's an interesting choice for a VR conversion, given the title's vibrant 8-bit art style and lack of direct narrative. VRFocus caught up with Nick Ludlam, one of the two developers porting the title to VR, to talk about the benefits of bringing titles like this obscure gem to the technology, and the challenges being faced in the conversion.
VRFocus posted a preview of the Proteus port last week. Here, Ludlum discusses potential new mechanics that are being adjusted to fit VR, including new control systems. It's possible that the team could even implement smartphones for controller input. Right now, Ludlam isn't sure exactly when the conversion will be released onto Steam on top of the original videogame, although hopefully it won't be too much longer. VRFocus will of course keep you updated as the project progresses.
Astonishing pictures show how a Devon kayaker got up close and personal with a humpback whale feeding frenzy
When you're in a tiny kayak and a 40-ton giant of the deep decides he's a bit peckish, the sensible option is to scarper as fast as your paddle can carry you.
But wildlife photographer Duncan Murrell does the opposite. To capture images of humpback whales feeding and surging through the surf off Alaska, he often ventures within 15ft of the fearsome creatures.
The humpbacks, which can grow to more than 50ft, spend most of their time underwater and can dive for up to 30 minutes, so being in the right place at the right time to see them requires skill and luck.

Duncan pauses in his kayak as he prepares to photograph the whales. Some days he has to paddle for 30 miles to keep up with them to get the images he wants

Mr Murrell, 56, from Paignton, Devon, anticipates where they will surface by watching out for bubbles – a sign that a group of humpbacks is working together to capture a shoal of herring.
One whale swims in a circle while blowing bubbles under the fish. When the bubbles rise, the herring form into a tight ball in the centre of the circle.
Other whales grunt and scream to scare the herring to the surface, and in a wall of spray they all then rise with their huge mouths open to enjoy their feast. On average, one humpback eats around 5,000lb of plankton, krill and fish a day.
‘When the feeding group explodes into view I have only a split second to decide whether I should either have my camera in my hands or my paddle to take evasive action,' said Mr Murrell. ‘Their habit of leaping out of the water without warning provides the ultimate adrenaline rush.'

By getting so close to the whales the images convey the drama and power of these magnificent creatures
After spending 20 years learning about and photographing humpbacks, he has earned the nickname ‘Whaleman' for his dramatic shots. While they can do severe damage to the herring community, humpbacks would not actively attack a human. But there
are obvious dangers in getting too close, especially when they are feeding.
A blow from such a massive tail could prove fatal, while getting too close when they breach the surface could cause the kayak to capsize.
‘I could not have chosen a more demanding and challenging subject to photograph than the whales,' said Mr Murrell, who paddles up to 30 miles a day to keep up with them.

After the great success of the cilantro experiment , we decided to undertake a similar approach with asparagus. As you probably know, some people find that asparagus makes their urine smell funny, while others experience no effect. In fact, observations on the effect of asparagus have been made as early as the 1700s. Ben Franklin included some negative comments about asparagus ("A few Stems of Asparagus eaten, shall give our Urine a disagreable Odour") in his essay on flatulence (I think my son's budding interest in Franklin will increase greatly knowing that Ben was equally interested in lightning and farts!) In contrast to the cilantro experiment, where I dislike the taste of the test food, I have no idea what the big deal is with asparagus, but my husband tells me of the foul smell that is the result of enjoying this verdant spring vegetable. Depending on the study, 33-60% of people cannot detect the smell. In our experiment, we all enjoyed a side of asparagus that was lightly pan seared with olive oil. Our son was not too excited by the taste of the vegetable, but he ate it for the sake of science. Frankly, I think he was curious what the outcome would be. After our next bladder evacuations, we compared notes on the smell. It seems my son has inherited his father's perception of asparagus smell. Unfortunately for us, this fun experiment did not encourage our boy to eat more asparagus. Rather, he can now use the smell as an excuse to avoid it.Next came the moment in the experiment to explain what happened and why. The first question is what it is about asparagus that makes urine smell different. Luckily, that one is firmly based in chemistry, so it is relatively straightforward to answer. The odor is the result of the metabolism of a chemical unique to asparagus: asparagusic acid. The infographic below from Compound Interest on the Chemistry of Asparagus includes the specifics on the chemical structures if you are curious. Asparagusic acid breaks down into four other sulfur-containing compounds, which happen to be volatile, evaporating quite readily and giving up their pungent odors in the process. Methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide are thought to be the culprits for the smell; this was determined by giving people purified forms of either compound, which can induce the smell without eating asparagus. It is thought that asparagusic acid helps asparagus keep pests away in the wild; the compound can prevent the growth of fungi as well as parasitic nematodes; consistent with this, the concentration of asparagusic acid is highest in the emerging shoots and other parts of the plant that are likely to be infected.The second question is why only some people experience the smell while others don't. The answer to this question is based in genetics and sense perception, so it is a bit more complicated. As with so many phenotypes, there is not one simple genetic explanation. There are two main physiological issues here: the metabolism of the asparagus and the perception of the smell of those metabolic byproducts. For some time, scientists thought that everyone was an excreter (meaning they could produce the smell in their urine), but that some people could not perceive the smell (the scientific term is anosmia). As more scientists started to ask people about their experience with asparagus, the story became murkier. There is variation in how people perceive the smell (from strong to mild) and there is also a small population of people that that do not metabolize asparagus the same way.There have been a number of papers looking at the genetic connection between anosmia and asparagus. A 2010 PLOS Genetics paper published by the personal genomics service 23andme seems to be the first paper linking asparagus anosmia to a particular genetic variation. The paper showed that several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring near genes encoding for odor receptors were correlated with asparagusic acid anosmia. The most significant association was seen in a gene encoding olfactory receptor 2 (, where the variation acted in a dominant fashion to decrease the likelihood of anosmia. genome-wide association study (GWAS) published in the journal BMJ in 2016 looked at a group of nearly 7000 Europeans. Their results suggest that a majority of this group (60%) had anosmia, with it being slightly more common in women than in men. Consistent with the results from 23andme, they found several SNPs in the olfactory receptor 2 genes. Thus, there is good evidence for the genetic basis for asparagus anosmia.What is still unknown is what SNPs (if any) are associated with the inability to excrete aspargusic acid. In addition, it is unclear if the ability to detect this smell has any evolutionary basis or if it is just a random mutation.These experiments taught me a lot about the science of food and taste perception. There are lots of opportunities to experiments with food in the future, While most of my previous experiments with food involve baking , there are lots of opportunities to experiment with food in the future. For example, this post from Discover Blogs talks about the large variety in how humans perceive tastes and the opportunity for citizen science to unravel that. I will be sure to post an update about our next foray into human genetics and food.

Well, that didn't take long.
No sooner did the Republicans revive their crusade against Democratic health care reform than the law's biggest boogeyman made a comeback as well. With the Senate unlikely to take up the repeal bill that passed the House last week any time soon, the GOP has started going after individual parts of the legislation. Among the first targets is a little-known provision creating an independent Medicare panel whose purpose, Republican critics insist, is to ration care and could speed patients to an early death—in other words, the 2011 incarnation of Sarah Palin's “death panels.”
Under federal health reform, the Medicare Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) will be a new, White House-appointed commission with the authority to change what Medicare pays for and how it pays for it—all without direct congressional approval. Many of health reform's biggest supporters have celebrated IPAB, which starts in 2015, as central to the entire law's ability to rein in ballooning Medicare spending. “It's absolutely critical. It's the centerpiece of the bill—the major way that you begin to control costs,” Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) tells Mother Jones. But Republicans say the board embodies the most pernicious and outrageous faults of “Obamacare,” delegating authority to unelected bureaucrats who could deny care to patients at their most critical moments.
“When you have more people wanting care than you have dollars to pay for, you get in a line, you ration care,” declared Rep. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.), who introduced a House bill to repeal the IPAB on Wednesday. “The board will decide, maybe you're 80 and that's a little too old to have your knee redone.” The Tennessee Republican warned that the board would empower bureaucrats—who would each receive a salary topping $165,000—to decide, “No, you can't have this treatment, because you've hit a budget limit.”
Analogies to Europe also abounded. Roe compared IPAB to a government board in England where bureaucrats might prescribe a blood transfusion for, say, chronic lymphocytic cancer—”if you're over a certain age—rather than the more aggressive treatment that patients would typically receive in the US.” Rep. John Fleming (R-La.), insisted that the board would drag the US back to an even darker period of European history. “It will take you back to the old Soviet Union, that's the way they did things—with a central planning committee that set prices, targeted costs,” her warned, adding that such economic policies ultimately led to the USSR's downfall.
Republicans have also been egged on by Sarah Palin, who spawned the myth that the federal law would create “death panels” throughout the debate. Though she originally targeted Medicare-supported end-of-life counseling sessions that never made it into the final bill, Palin expanded her attack to include IPAB as well. The board, she argued in a 2009 Wall Street Journal op-ed, would “empower unelected bureaucrats to make decisions affecting life or death health-care matters.”
Though Palin's claims were widely debunked—the non-partisan Politifact called her “death panel” remark the 2009 “Lie of the Year”—her remarks have continued to resonate throughout the right-wing echo chamber. When asked on Wednesday whether he would link the board to the popular concern about “death panels,” Roe replied: “Absolutely.” Attacking Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) for wanting to expand IPAB's authority, one conservative Virginia blog accused the Democratic Senator of telling his constituents: “Sorry, you should have gotten cancer last year.”
In reality, the rules governing IPAB explicitly bar “any recommendation to ration health care.” The IPAB-endorsed Medicare reimbursement cuts are system-wide and will most directly affect physicians and other medical providers, who are lobbying to defang the board. Contrary to many of the examples that Republicans have offered, individual patients will not appear before any board or other bureaucracy. And Congress does have the authority to overturn its recommendations but only if the president agrees or it has a veto-proof majority.
Republicans, nevertheless, are drawing allies in their crusade against IPAB from the other side of the aisle as well. The board was only included in the Senate's version of the health care bill, not the House's, and the controversy surrounding its inclusion got buried in the last-minute flurry of negotiations during the reconciliation process to pass the bill. In fact, 72 House Democrats signed onto a letter opposing inclusion of the board, and four Dems voted against putting in the Senate version of the bill. Liberal Democrats raised concerns about delegating so much authority to a body independent of Congress: as Roe himself pointed out on Wednesday, Rep. Pete Stark (D-Calif.) has called IPAB a “dangerous provision” that would make Medicare cuts based on “an arbitrary and unrealistic growth rate.”
Even Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), one of Pelosi's closest confidantes, admitted Wednesday that he had “some concerns” about IPAB for similar reasons. Waxman says that he'd be reluctant to strike down that particular part of the bill, but he added that he would “have to listen to the arguments and review again.” Close political observers, moreover, warn that IPAB repeal stands a real chance of making it through Congress. “Could it pass the Senate now, with Democratic support? Sure, given the intensity of lobbyist opposition to it, liberal opposition to it, and Rebpublican desire to strip anything out of [health reform] and call it a victory over the President,” said Len Nichols, a leading health-care economist and former Clinton administration official, though he added that making up for the substantial cost savings—estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to be $28 billion through 2019—would be a challenge.
Republicans admit that the most inflammatory attacks on IPAB are less likely to gain widespread support. “I don't want to call them ‘death panels'—that's just a red herring,” said Rep. Bill Posey (R-Fla.), a supporter of the bill to repeal the board. “I want to keep the discussion objective.” Posey, nevertheless, concurred with the central attack on the board—and stressed its potentially deadly implications for patients. “The danger for patients is that the board will not allow you to access care that you need,” Posey insisted. Could that include life-or-death treatments? “It could be anything,” he replied.
Congress president Sonia Gandhi planned to visit Zakia Jafri, widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri who was killed in the post-Godhra riots of 2002, but was prevented from doing so by party leaders, claims retired DGP R B Sreekumar, in his book Gujarat: Behind the Curtain which was released last week.
Advertising
The chief of the Gujarat Intelligence Bureau in April-September 2002, Sreekumar accuses the Congress-led UPA as well of betraying the expectations of riot victims regarding justice, even as he slams the BJP and Sangh Parivar for their role in the violence.
His book, the first by an IPS officer who was in service of the Gujarat government during the 2002 riots, talks about the “illegal” briefs given to him in the course of his five-month stint as ADGP, CID (intelligence), soon after the Godhra train carnage that sparked communal riots across Gujarat.
While in service, Sreekumar had filed four affidavits before the Justice (retd) G T Nanavati and Justice (retd) Akshay Mehta Commission on the alleged collusion of government agencies with rioters. The Gujarat government initiated a probe against him for maintaining an unofficial “secret diary” and giving out “classified information” before the panel, in which he got a stay from the Supreme Court in October.
Advertising
Terming the conduct of the Congress leadership at the state and Centre during the course and aftermath of the riots as “quite vacillatingly obnoxious”, Sreekumar writes, “Soulless secularism and over-sensitivity to Hindu sentiments presumably prompted Congress leaders to block the plans of Congress president Sonia Gandhi to visit Zakia Jafri… during her Gujarat visit after the riots, for expressing condolence.”
Further, he accuses both the UPA that came to power at the Centre in 2004 and the then Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh of failing to provide evidence that could have aided probe into the Godhra carnage and riot cases.
“UPA government did not provide information on reports by the Army and central paramilitary forces about what they had experienced in Gujarat, during the 2002 riots, when they were deployed for assisting Gujarat administration. Reportedly, Congress was apprehensive that too much of an anti-(Narendra) Modi posture would alienate a section of Hindus, who are anti-Muslims but not pro-BJP. Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh also did not do anything to get evidence of eyewitnesses to (the) Godhra train fire incident from UP Police, who were escorting the Gujarat contingent of Ram bhaktas returning after kar seva from Ayodhya in February 2002.”
The former police officer accuses the UPA government of “not releasing copies of letters sent by President K R Narayanan to Prime Minister A B Vajpayee on Gujarat riots”, and of not providing reports of the Central intelligence bureau to the judicial commission probing the riots.
He alleges that the Manmohan Singh regime also ignored demands for a separate judicial commission to probe the chief minister (Modi).
Calling the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team headed by ex-CBI director R K Raghavan ‘Special Immunisation Team', Sreekumar says the closure report filed by it on Zakia Jafri's complaint against then chief minister Modi and 62 others did not have legal standing.
“It is quite debatable as to how Supreme Court can accord status of investigation as defined in Section 2 of CrPC to SIT enquiry, without backing of any provisions in law. The Supreme Court also did not explain adequately the grounds for deeming SIT enquiry as investigation. SIT's closure report, therefore, also cannot be deemed as a final report under Section 173 CrPC,” he writes.
Beginning every chapter in his book with verses from the Bhagvad Gita, Vedas, Mahabharata, Thirukkural by Thiruvalluvar, the Bible, the Hadith and the Quran, Sreekumar says he had prepared “anonymous notes” on “the police positioned in sensitive areas acting as facilitators to rioters, higher number of persons from victim community getting killed in police firing and riots, belligerent mobs shouting about police abetment to their crimes”, based on his observation as ADGP (Armed Units), and despatched the same to the president of India, leader of Opposition and senior leaders of major “secular political parties”.
“I was quite aware that it was an act of misconduct as per conduct rules, but I was forced to do it for getting some solace from the intense agony and tormenting helplessness felt by me in those days, having failed to do anything, due to legal constraints, to contain and control violence against hundreds of innocents….”
Sreekumar notes that among the officers who kept silent on the 2002 riots were six IAS and seven IPS Muslim officers from Gujarat. According to him, two Muslim officers, including a commandant, even defied his “written orders” to give shelter to 500 Muslims from Naroda Patiya on the state reserve police (SRP) premises.
“… consequently, they had become victims of riots… Most of the 96 people killed in the evening in Naroda Patiya were reportedly from this group of Muslims… No action was initiated for defying written order of ADGP (AU) and no report was made.”
Sreekumar, who retired in 2007, works with victims of human rights violations and joined the Aam Aadmi Party last year. He resigned from its primary membership recently after the CBI raid against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's trusted bureaucrat Rajendra Kumar.
Who is R B Sreekumar?
* Sreekumar's first confrontation with the then Narendra Modi government was when he presented a report before then Chief Election Commissioner J M Lyngdoh on August 9, 2002, stating that 154 of 182 constituencies had been affected by the riots and over one lakh people had been disenfranchised because of displacement, countering the government claims that the situation was peaceful enough to hold early polls.
* Sreekumar was asked for an explanation by the state government following a report by him saying controversial IPS officer D G Vanzara had planted weapons on some Muslims ahead of the rath yatra of 2002.
* Sreekumar was transferred out of CID (intelligence) soon after he sent a report on “communal overtones” in Modi's speech during the Gaurav Yatra, to the National Commission for Minorities, in September 2002.

* Following the submission of nine affidavits by him and his cross-examination before the Nanavati-Mehta commission in 2004, Sreekumar was superseded in 2005. The reason cited was a criminal case of 1987 pending against him.

VILSECK, Germany -- The 7th Army Joint Multinational Training Command (JMTC) expanded its training capabilities with the official opening of its Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) facility at Vilseck Army Airfield Oct. 7th, 2013.
The following day, JMTC and the U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria invited press, local and state political representatives to tour the facility and talk with U.S. and German Soldiers on UAS training at JMTC.
The newly-completed facility is the only one of its kind available to U.S. forces in Europe.
"I wanted to invite our German neighbors and members of the press to come in and see the facility, see and handle the UAS aircraft that are flying at the Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels training areas and speak directly with the Soldiers who maintain and fly them." said Brig. Gen. Walter E. Piatt, JMTC Commander.
Each of the three types of Unmanned Aerial Systems used by U.S. Army Soldiers at JMTC training areas -- the Raven, the Shadow, and the Hunter -- were on display in the main facility hangar during the event. Each UAS was accompanied by its operators and maintenance crews, as well as German-speaking U.S. Soldiers to translate technical data about the equipment and its operation.
The three UAS models commonly used at JMTC by the German Bundeswehr to train -- the KZO, the Luna and the EMT Aladin -- were also on display.
"Although we only use UAS's at JMTC to train Soldiers -- they are not armed, nor do they record data when in flight," said Piatt. "We understand that our German neighbors have concerns and we want to make sure we address those concerns ."
One of those concerns was in regards to two air corridors between the Hohenfels and Grafenwoehr training areas. A Letter of Agreement with German authorities authorizes the U.S. Army Hunter MQ-5B unmanned aerial systems to use the two corridors as an air bridge to train UAS operators. The air bridge replicates the distances that Soldiers would have to fly and navigate in Afghanistan, say UAS operators.
In order to give the attendees an accurate idea of the training, an actual Hunter UAS was on display during the event, as well as maps of the air corridors and Hunter UAS training instructors to explain how the training is conducted.
"The air bridge will only be used for transit between the two training areas." said Col. John Norris, Commander of the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels. "And of course, no UAS will carry weapons through the air bridge."
JMTC officials say regular training with UAS is just one of many tools available on the U.S. Army's Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels training areas. Used in conjunction with the live-fire ranges, maneuver areas, simulation and training resources, it will help prepare U.S. and partner-nation forces to prevent conflict in the region, shape strong international partnerships, and, if necessary, win decisively on any battlefield.
A new study concludes Australian workers who live in the suburbs and drive to work in the CBD could save a fortune if they used public transport instead. But it's a choice most workers don't have
New research estimates a Sydney worker living in the outer suburbs could save between $2,946 and $11,170 per year if she takes public transport to work in the CBD instead of driving a ‘light class' car like a Toyota Yaris 1.3 litre hatch.
If she drives a behemoth such as a Toyota Landcruiser she'll save between $9,171 and $18,606 each and every year by switching to public transport.
The study, Commuter costs and potential savings, got good coverage across the nation in the media last week because it had numbers for most capital cities. It was done for the Australasian Railway Association by Dr Jian Wang at the CRC for Rail Innovation, Southern Cross University
It compares the cost of commuting to the CBD by public transport against the cost of driving under two scenarios (1).
The smaller saving assumes the commuter has a car but leaves it at home and takes public transport instead. The larger saving assumes using public transport enables a commuter to live entirely car-free or avoid the cost of buying a second car.
I think the relevance of the higher estimate is somewhat limited in the case of outer suburban households because living without at least one car is very difficult and having two is a boon, particularly at night and on weekends. Practically every household already has at least one car and most have two or more (2).
But even the lower estimates are serious money. I don't have any problems with Dr Wang's numbers; they sound about right to me. Any outer suburbanite who drives to work must be mad, right?
However before readers conclude drivers living in the deep of suburbia are all thick as two planks (confirmation bias?), there are a number of points to consider.
First, the study is only about commutes to the CBD. Only a small proportion of metropolitan jobs are in the CBD and most workers already travel there by public transport. For example, Melbourne's CBD (including Southbank, Docklands and Carlton) has 15% of metropolitan jobs. Cars only have around 20-30% mode share within walking distance of the rail loop.
Second, only a small proportion of outer suburbanites work in the CBD (and those that do tend to live in the more salubrious suburbs). The great majority work in the suburbs and commute via car.
Third, those who do work in the CBD already strongly favour public transport. Most use it because the CBD is the one place that's well-served by trains and buses from the outer suburbs, particularly during rush hour.
It's also a place where the car's advantages are fettered by the length of the commute, traffic congestion and high parking charges.
Fourth, the tiny residual group that drives from the outer suburbs isn't stupid. Its members don't worry much about the cost of driving because in many cases their expenses are being met in whole or in part by their employer and the taxpayer e.g. parking.
They're also usually well-paid professionals who can to some degree manage congestion e.g. by varying their arrival and departure times. Some also drive because they need to use a vehicle during working hours.
Others drive because it's a convenient way to get to other activities before and/or after work e.g. study, child care, visiting parents or friends, sport. They calculate the aggravation and cost of driving to the CBD is worth it for the after-hours flexibility it provides.
Overall then, while Dr Wang's comparison is interesting and accurate, in terms of changing behaviour it's really only relevant to a very small number of current drivers.
The great majority of suburban commuters don't realistically have the choice of swapping their car for a train or bus. Their commutes aren't to the CBD but from dispersed origins to dispersed destinations. For them, the existing level of public transport service simply isn't competitive with driving because trips takes longer.
A study by BITRE looked at all commutes, not just those to the CBD (see What is the cost of commuting by car versus public transport?). It estimated the total time outer suburban household members in Melbourne devote to commuting each week is 1,326 minutes by public transport versus 521 minutes by car. The value of this “saved” time makes up for the higher financial cost of driving (3).

A rap song which carries a message of strong support for equal marriage, has reached the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Rap duo Macklemore and Ryan Lewis released the song Same Love, in February, but as momentum has gained in the campaign for equal marriage across the US, sales have improved, up to last week when it sold 110,000 copies, the most since it was released.
The song, from the pair's latest album, addresses Macklemore's personal experiences and feelings around the issue of same-sex relationships and equal marriage, and features a video spanning the lives of a gay couple, including a happy marriage.
The lyrics were inspired by Referendum 74, at which voters in the US state of Washington voted to uphold a law legalising equal marriage.
The song, which also features vocalist Mary Lambert, entered the American Billboard Hot 100 chart recently, despite being released in February this year. Some have attributed its success to momentum gained in equal marriage campaigns leading up to the US Supreme Court's ruling in favour of same-sex marriage, in two cases last week.
As it approaches a million sales, the song jumped from 28 to 16 in the Hot 100, as well as from 23 to 8 on the US Digital Songs chart.
Macklemore and Ryan Lewis rose to fame last year with the song Thrift Shop, which reached number one in the UK chart. Their follow up Can't Hold Us, is currently at number 17 of the UK chart, after being in the chart for 16 weeks.
The song Same Love, about equal marriage in the US, which was seen as a positive sign that attitudes towards same-sex marriages are changing for the better, both in the rap industry, and in general, is available to view below.

“It's still flying?”
This is a question I and many of my fellow space enthusiasts have been hearing a lot lately. As the space shuttle program comes to an end, public excitement around space travel seems to be rekindled. Attention sparked up again as people heard that Space Shuttle Atlantis was preparing to launch for the last time, marking the end of the space shuttle program. But for one young person, that interest had never faded, and witnessing the shuttle's final flight became an imperative, a very personal hope and dream. That person was me.
When I was 12, in my middle school gym locker room, I was sucker-punched in the stomach by a bully and subsequently paralyzed. Prior to this incident, I was a professional actor. I traveled from my home in New Jersey into New York City and was the voice behind some well-known commercials, doing voiceovers, jingles, and other spots. To go from performing card tricks for a DVD to my body playing tricks on me was truly a difficult experience. In the same situation, many others have succumbed to the misery of that experience, and in doing so, have become unable to realize their full potential. But I realized that there was still a whole world out there, and that one event, even an event this significant and painful, should not ruin my life. I wanted to be someone who never says, and gets up when he is down. This is what has got me through life, and to where I am today.
After months of rehabilitation, I realized that I couldn't go back to the summer camp I had been attending to study acting. My parents started looking for another place for me to go for summer camp, and they found the Lower Hudson Valley Challenger Center. The Challenger Centers for Space Science Education were founded out of the ashes of the space shuttle Challenger accident in 1986: the families of the crew members wanted to build a living memorial to their loved ones, and continue their goal of education (this fated shuttle mission had included the first school teacher). Now, there are nearly 50 Challenger Centers worldwide, and they offer activities that include running simulated space missions to the moon, Mars, and to rendezvous with a comet.. My family and I learned that the maximum age for the center's summer camp was 12, and by that time, I was already 13. But the director of the center, John Huibregtse, didn't turn me away. I became the summer camper who never left, and to this day, I remain an employee of the now renamed Town of Ramapo Challenger Center. This turning point four years ago was the spark that jump-started my love of space.
At the encouragement of a good friend, I took that love of space to Twitter and became @thenasaman. I was quickly overwhelmed by the response from people who shared the same passion for space exploration. I knew I had found something for me. When I was in the hospital again and again over the last two years, lying in a bed waiting for one of my 19 surgeries, I knew there were people out there who cared about me and were there for me all the way through.
One day I saw read a tweet from somebody who was “fed up” with the way space travel was portrayed in media, and wanted to start a podcast. I figured, why not? One thing led to another, and Gene Mikulka, Mark Ratterman, Gina Herlihy and I became the team of Talking Space. Who knew that our little podcast, which started out so small on September 9, 2009, would evolve into what it is today: a steady listener base of over 25,000 people, simulcast on the website Astronomy.FM, and a recognized media source by NASA.
And that leads me to my adventures at the Kennedy Space Center. We knew media would be swarming to cover the final launch of STS-135, and we knew it would be hard to get in. But we all applied for press credentials. With the help of the amazing Miles O'Brien, a former CNN anchor and science correspondent who was doing launch coverage for PBS and the website Spaceflight Now, I was accepted as a member of the press. My fellow podcast team members were also approved to cover the launch as media. The funniest part is that the entire team had never before been together under one roof (or in this case, a tent) at the same time. This was to be history for us, too, as the shuttle program completed its 30-year history.
As the team made its way to Cape Canaveral for launch, we anxiously anticipated what the final launch might bring. As we passed through the doors of the KSC press building, we were in shock. The sheer number of people packed into such a small space was mind-boggling. So many countries were represented. “Where were these people over the last 30 years?,” we asked each other. It was phenomenal to see such a turnout, but where were they for the lesser-known missions?
We sat in the sacred grounds of the NASA press auditorium. I was ready. The microphone was passed up to me. I asked my question, something I had seen many famous names in space reporting do. I received an amazing answer. The pride I felt in just being able to ask a simple question overwhelmed me. Who knows how good it'll feel once I finally receive professional training, when I attend the S.I. Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University this fall.
The astronaut interviews came and went, the press conferences began and ended, and the tours and visits to the launch pad concluded. I was within 150 feet of the space shuttle for Rotating Service Structure retraction. That was truly tremendous, to see the grandeur of such an American icon less than 24 hours before it leaves the tugs of Earth.
And then, launch day finally arrived: July 8, 2011. I had seen one previous launch before, STS-130, which was a night launch of the space shuttle Endeavour (I attended through the Make-A-Wish Foundation). But this would be my first daytime launch—and my last, and the world's last.
To see the shuttle sitting on launch pad 39A, to look at the machine which mankind—not just Americans—sculpted, designed, built, and maintained, meant so much. There sat the pride of America's space travels over the last 30 years. The most complex and beautiful machine ever built was poised and ready to show her awesome might, to light the engines one last time, igniting America's passion for exploration and knowledge, and send into space the hopes and dreams of not only a nation, but of the entire human race. As the clock ticked down, and I broadcast it live to over 200,000 people listening around the world, we all held our breath together. The countdown clock stopped at 31 seconds until liftoff, as engineers examined a warning.
The vehicle was quickly re-cleared for launch and the count started back up. I knew that what was about to happen would remain embedded in the minds of all who witnessed it for years to come. The engines ignited, the shuttle cleared the tower, and then I saw…absolutely nothing! Yet, I heard…absolutely nothing! I looked for the vehicle, and I was suddenly temporarily blinded by some bright light. My eyes adjusted, and I saw the mighty Atlantis roar skyward, fulfilling the dream of a nation and a civilization of bringing humans into space. The noise of the engines gradually increased until it was deafening. You hear the vehicle, as the air crackles with life, but you also feel it throughout your chest as it vibrates you from the inside out. You can truly feel the power of the vehicle, not just in Joules or Newtons, but in the human ingenuity and pride from the thousands of people who have worked on it.
Anybody born within the last 30 years knows no other American vehicle for manned space flight but the space shuttle. Even though this program is over, the dream remains alive. After seeing this launch, I know that dream will stay with me forever. The experience of seeing Atlantis launch on that cloudy, muggy morning is permanently engraved in my thoughts. The feeling I had as the sound reached us at the press site will stay with me forever. I hope someday I will feel that again. I do not doubt that we will soon see an American rocket lifting off a launch pad in Florida, and that from the technological lessons we've learned from the space shuttle, that the next vehicle may be even safer, and that the advancements made since this program will help those on Earth. Maybe they will even allow me to walk again one day.
There is a phrase I live by. It is true not only for the space program, but for life in general:
Don't tell me the sky is the limit when there are footprints on the moon.

A Screenshot of NBC New York's report on Avroham Gross, the gang member-turned-Hasidic rabbi.
JTA - In 1995, Latin Kings gang member Roberto Eddy Santos was sentenced to prison for multiple violent robberies. Upon his release from Sing Sing Correctional Facility a decade later, Santos emerged a changed man. Literally.
Santos reportedly converted to Judaism, changed his name to Avroham Gross, and assumed the identity of a rabbi.
Unfortunately, Santos — or Gross — wasn't wholly committed to the rabbinate. NBC New York is reporting that the ex-convict is now facing dozens of charges after allegedly posing as a law enforcement officer, making traffic stops and even helping to arrest a woman he suspected of trying to break into a car.
Gross also used forged documents to pretend to be part of a nonexistent “child abuse prevention task force.”
“This is one the strangest cases, it is bizarre, but it is still serious to us,” said Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson in an interview with NBC New York.
Among other things, authorities are investigating whether or not Gross had a “genuine conversion.”
You can watch NBC's full report below.
Alan Keyes claims that Rep. Michele Bachmann's plan to sue President Obama doesn't go far enough and may actually aid Obama's “dictatorship.”
Instead, he wants the Tea Party darling — who last year accused Obama of “committing impeachable offenses” — to join his Jesus Christ-endorsed campaign to get congressional candidates to pledge to support the impeachment and removal of the president.
“Bachmann and her colleagues should take the impeachment/removal pledge, and campaign as hard as they know how to get every like-minded Senator and Representative they can to do likewise,” Keyes writes. “Combined with an energetic grassroots mobilization of voters demanding that candidates for either house of Congress take the pledge, their campaign would help to make the 2014 election an effective vote of no-confidence in Obama's lawless, unconstitutional administration.”
One problem with his approach, however, is that Bachmann is not running for re-election.
Why EMV Will Lead the Payments Security Transformation
March 9, 2015 By: Kevin Xu
As October's EMV liability shift quickly approaches, payments industry stakeholders are not just preparing for the considerable transition to chip card usage in the U.S. – they're also laying the foundation for the future of payments, including mobile and other emerging payment technologies.
But while the chip infrastructure is expected to deliver significant benefits in the card present environment, card networks are also acutely aware of the additional avenues of risk opening up as fraudsters shift their focus to areas such as online spending.
Ellie Smith, who leads the Discover's Chip Center of Excellence, sits on the EMF Steering Committee and holds a seat on the EMVCo Executive Committee, shares her thoughts on the ongoing U.S. EMV rollout, as well as what's next in the future of payments security.
Multi-channel payments and multi-channel security
As different payment channels emerge, brick and mortar merchants must ensure they continue to provide a seamless and secure payment experience – all while staying relevant with their consumers by providing a variety of payment options.
The current focus is on getting chip cards into the hands of consumers and educating merchants on its usage and the benefits of adoption. EMV is a strong pillar in cutting down fraud. While it is the cornerstone in the future of payments security, Smith stresses that the industry must “look beyond card-present transactions to securing all other channels of payments.”
A more secure point of sale means that fraudsters will target the next point of weakness.
According to Smith, “Consumers are advancing their behavior and preferences quickly. Beyond the move toward using contact and contactless EMV, they are also increasing their online shopping, using mobile devices for all types of banking-related transactions, and becoming more comfortable using NFC-enabled technology for payments via mobile devices.”
Greater volumes of online payments naturally mean a greater risk for card-not-present fraud.
To this end, Discover is using chip cards as the foundation for multi-channel payments security. EMV can be used to secure card-present transactions, while transactions in the card-not-present channel can be secured using tokenization and more intensive customer authentication through the next generation of 3D Secure.
A unified approach
Payment networks must contend with supporting all the moving pieces in payments. The challenge is in bringing these players together to find common ground in security, and promoting industry standards, such as EMV.
Despite the abundance of competition, Smith believes “this is not a time for industry players to create specifications and standards for emerging payments that only apply to their system. Instead, Discover strongly supports the industry coming together to enable emerging commerce.”
The best, and perhaps only, way forward is through continued collaboration, and “the right solution requires collective industry support, universal standards, and equal opportunity,” Smith explained.
Discover is partnering with card issuers, merchants, acquirers, processors, and value-added resellers in the industry to support the implementation of EMV, as well as deliver other security solutions that will protect across the payments ecosystem.
The main takeaway is that the industry must remain active and partner for greater and unified security measures. “One of the major hurdles the industry faces is continuously increasing security, and we must come together in order to do so,” says Smith.
What's next?
The payments industry itself must look towards these new advancements and adapt. Smith states, “We are in a time of digital transformation, with great opportunities to leverage new technology that offers customers more seamless, secure, and convenient ways to pay. In this evolving landscape, we are embracing change, as it's going to drive more merchant-friendly solutions and innovative payment methods for consumers.”
Most importantly, regardless of the innovations and security standards that are yet to come, “payments must remain frictionless, simple, and most of all, secure, for consumers.”

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent federal agency, to be led by a single director.
The bureau's first director, Richard Cordray, resigned last week and Leandra English, the deputy director, became the agency's acting director by law, according to a lawsuit filed by English on Sunday.
Hours after Cordray's resignation, however, President Donald Trump announced he was instead appointing his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, to head the CFPB on an interim basis.
Today, both English and Mulvaney are claiming authority over the agency, and even sending e-mails to confused employees as acting director.
According to English's complaint filed in federal court, the Dodd-Frank Act clearly mandates that English, as the deputy director, shall serve as the acting director.
The Department of Justice disagrees. In a memo, the DOJ concluded that Trump has the authority to name Mulvaney the acting head of the agency.
Who is right?
The director of the CFPB is one of the many offices filled by presidential appointment, with the "advice and consent" of the Senate.
The federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 gives the president the power to temporarily authorize an acting official to perform the duties of an officer of an executive agency. The critical language in the Vacancies Reform Act is this: It is the "exclusive means" for authorizing the appointment of an acting head unless another statute expressly designates a particular officer to serve in that acting capacity.
In fact, the law establishing the CFPB does just that: It expressly designates a particular officer and states that the CFPB's deputy director shall "serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the Director."
Here, both the DOJ and English agree. Where they disagree is on the meaning of the word "exclusive."
English's interpretation is that the Vacancies Reform Act is a default in case there is no other statute. But because the Dodd-Frank Act expressly designates how the CFPB vacancy is filled, then Dodd-Frank becomes the exclusive way to fill the post, and the Vacancies Reform Act ceases to have any legal authority.
The DOJ's interpretation is that because the Dodd-Frank Act designates how the CFPB vacancy is filled, then Dodd-Frank just becomes one of two ways to fill the vacancy. The Vacancies Reform Act continues to be an alternative legal way to fill the vacancy. Under that interpretation, the Vacancies Reform Act is no longer the exclusive way to fill vacancies — it becomes an additional way to do so.
The courts will have to decide which interpretation is right.

Amy Craton is a typical college student. She loves scrolling through Facebook, watching Netflix, and going to bed way too late.
There's just one small difference between her and her classmates: Craton is 93 years old.
"Sitting here one day in front of the computer, I thought, boy, I'm just wasting my time here. I think I'll go back to college and finish my degree," Craton, who lives in Honolulu, told NBC News.
Special section: Get tips and advice about college at College Game Plan
Craton first went to college decades ago, but the mother of four had to cut her studies short to get a full-time job after she and her husband divorced.

She worked as an administrative assistant for a chemical plant for years, and always dreamed of finishing her degree. But because she now uses a wheelchair and is hard of hearing, attending college in person wasn't a possibility.
So after her son suggested she take classes online, Craton decided to enroll in virtual courses through Southern New Hampshire University — a school she chose, she said, because it brought back fond memories of vacationing in New Hampshire as a child. Craton is pursuing a Bachelor's in creative writing and English through the university's online portal.

Despite her age — she'll be 94 by the time she graduates in the fall — the computer-savvy Craton hasn't encountered any technical difficulties.
"I'm on Facebook and I email. I'm all over. The minute I get up in the morning, I go over and I check the news here and in the world," she said. "I'm comfortable being online."
With a 4.0 GPA, she also hasn't had any trouble keeping up with the course load, said her academic adviser, Chrisandra Bauer, who has worked with Craton since she enrolled in September 2014.
Bauer called Craton "so persistent and so dedicated," and said she rarely reaches out for help.

"This is kind of something amazing for me to witness," Bauer told NBC News. "She's just that kind of student that takes initiative and figures things out on her own."
University officials say Craton will be the oldest student to ever get her degree from Southern New Hampshire University. She may also be one of the oldest students in the U.S., although records are hard to come by: According to the National Center for Education Statistics, just 5 percent of undergraduates at private four-year non-profit institutions are 35 and older, but it doesn't break down the statistics beyond that.
The biggest challenge Craton has encountered is the six-hour time difference between Hawaii and New Hampshire. To get her assignments in on time, Craton will often stay up until the wee hours of the morning.
"At nighttime, it's a good time for me to do my studying and my writing. It will be sometimes 5 o'clock in the morning before I go to bed," she said.

Craton has two terms left before she graduates in October.
"She isn't able to travel [to commencement] so she'll actually be getting her diploma in the mail," Bauer said. "That's something I'm working on, with making sure we'll be able to send a nice package, have it framed. Just to make it a little bit more special."
After Craton graduates, she plans to use her degree to write poetry. She's already bought a haiku for beginners book, along with other books on poetry.
"It's never dull. I've always got something to do. And I'm always learning something," she said.
Mason's motion criticised for biblical interpretation of creation
CHILDREN in Scotland's schools should be aware that the creation of the Earth in six days cannot be "proved or disproved by science", according to three Scottish National Party MSPs.
A motion proposed by Glasgow Shettleston's John Mason has now received the support of colleagues Richard Lyle and Dave Thompson MSP.
The motion follows new guidelines in South Lanarkshire relating to the behaviour of chaplains and religious organisations in schools.
Thomson told CommonSpace: "There are a variety of different views in relation to faith and interpretation of the bible. Children should be open to these things. Faith has been an important part of the history of man and woman kind, and children should be aware of a broad range of views."
"Where I object is that the Secular Society are trying to shut down discussion and oppose free speech. The whole thing around the French magazine Charlie Hebdo was about free speech, and the freedom to criticise religion. Equally religion has to have the freedom of speech to express its beliefs."
Teaching literal interpretations of the Genesis creation story to children is rejected as unethical and inaccurate by scientific and secular campaigning groups.
Alistair McBay, National Secular Society spokesperson for Scotland, said: "The fact that groups are dedicated to infiltrating creationism, often branded as 'intelligent design', into classrooms means that guidance to ban creationism in science classrooms is needed now."
The motion comes after further fall out from the Kirktonholme Primary in East Kilbride, where creationist missionaries were invited into the school by its head teachers to share books on the dangers of atheism and raise money for church building in the United States. Parents accused the 'Church of Christ' sect of attempting to brainwash their children. The two head teachers were then sacked and the group denied further access to the school.
Last week, following a full investigation, South Lanarkshire council issued guidelines on the teaching of religion in schools.
On Tuesday the Scottish Parliament welcomed a petition from the Scottish Secular Society (SSS) in favour of national guidelines on the issue.
Caroline Lynch, former chair of SSS, said: "It is important that they understand we seek no new law or ban on Creationism, but guidance that ensures that discussions of the creation myths of any religions featured in schools are conveyed in the appropriate place, the Religious and Moral Education classroom. Guidelines mirroring those already in place in England need not stifle discussion and debate, but simply ensure that ideas without evidence are not given the stature of accepted science."
The petition - which has the support of nobel prize winners Sir Richard Roberts, Harold Kroto and Sir John Sulston - will now be considered by the Education and Culture committee. Previously, the Scottish Government's Learning Directorate said that "guidance on these matters is unnecessary".
The petitions proposals are opposed by the Free Church of Scotland, who say they risk authoritarianism.
Professor Paul Braterman, senior chemistry researcher at the University of Glasgow and adviser to SSS, satirised the Mason motion in an online piece.
Braterman asked: "What is the evidence that you are not a dinosaur? Why is it not a valid belief for people to hold that you really are a dinosaur? How does the evidence compare with the evidence against a six-day creation from geology, physics, astronomy and cosmology, geography, and I haven't even started on the fossil record or molecular biology."
Braterman references research in astronomy on the origin of the big-bang, finding that the sun is around 4.5 billion years old (helioseismology), and light patterns from universes 12 billion light-years away.
The Society of Biology submitted its support for scientific guidelines on teaching to the Scottish Parliament Petition's Committee.
Their recommendations stated: "Creationism and intelligent design are not considered to be scientific theories based on tested hypotheses, and therefore should not be taught in science lessons. Furthermore we urge the Scottish Government to provide teachers with appropriate training opportunities to develop the skills to answer controversial questions posed in science lessons in a clear and sensitive manner."
John Mason's office directed CommonSpace towards his recent Twitter comments on the issue where he said: "Even young kids can understand that God made them...Religious people deserve their voice to be heard just like other minorities e.g. black, disabled, LGBT".
Richard Lyle MSP was not available for comment.

Poe's tales of terror have granted him a kind of literary immortality. Who could forget the horrific pit and pendulum, the masquerade ball of death, and the beating of the tell-tale heart? His poetry is also beautiful and very memorable.

Yet he had a little-known sideline — speculations about science. In his final work Eureka — A Prose Poem, published in 1848, one year before he died, Poe outlined some of his theories of the cosmos. His aims were most ambitious, especially for someone who lacked formal scientific training:
I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical — of the Material and Spiritual Universe — of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny.
In Eureka, Poe painted a picture of a diverse, possibly infinite universe, speckled with countless stars, each composed of assorted atoms. This variety, he proposed, must have emerged sometime in the past from a far denser, unified state. Somehow, the primordial cosmic egg hatched into a remarkably diverse universe. As he wrote:
My general proposition, then, is this: In the Original Unity of the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable Annihilation.

One of the curious riddles of Poe's time, associated with one of its proposers, German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers in the 1820s, was the question of why the sky is dark at night. Assuming that the universe was infinitely large and infinitely old, Olbers pointed out that if you trace any point of the sky far enough away from Earth, eventually you would reach a star. Therefore that star's light would eventually reach us and illuminate that point. Because this would be true for all points in the sky, he concluded that it should be flooded with light, even at nighttime.

Why doesn't midnight look like noon? Especially in those light-pollution-free times, nocturnal skies were cathedrals of darkness broken only by pinpoint stellar lanterns, not blazing spectacles. Horror writers and lamplighters counted on that. The House of Usher would look much less fearful if it were all lit up at night like Yankee Stadium. Luckily, for fans of the macabre, parts of the world are murky not gleaming. Therefore, Olbers' paradox warranted sound explanation.
“Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination” (1935) Illustrated by Arthur Rackham, Wikimedia Common
Poe phrased the riddle in the following way:
Were the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would present us a uniform luminosity, like that displayed by the Galaxy-since there could be absolutely no point, in all that background, at which would not exist a star.
Poe's brilliant solution relied on three general principles. First, the speed of light is finite. As had been established in his day, he knew that light was very fast but not instantaneous — its speed could be measured. Secondly, space is enormous. Starlight would take numerous years to reach us — for some stars, maybe even thousands or millions of years. As he put this in Eureka:
The only mode, therefore, in which, under such a state of affairs, we could comprehend the voids which our telescopes find in innumerable directions, would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no ray from it has yet been able to reach us at all.
Implicit in that final phrase is the third principle: the universe must be of a finite age. By stating that “no ray from [certain light sources] has been able to reach us,” Poe asserts that stars began shining a finite time in the cosmic past. Those might have been preceded by earlier stars, but far enough back in cosmic history, there were no shining stars, only darkness. The dark canopy of the sky represents all the places where no star has formed that is close enough for light to have reached us in the intervening time. Thus, the cosmos couldn't be infinitely old, as Olbers had assumed.

When Poe penned Eureka, the concept of a “day without yesterday” was mere speculation. Science had no proof that the observable universe had a finite age. Therefore, his prescient conclusion was an excellent example of the kind of proof by deduction a savvy detective would do — such as Poe's famous fictional sleuth C. Auguste Dupin who employed deductive reasoning to solve mysteries.

Poe, of course, could not have known that the Milky Way is but one of a multitude of galaxies, receding from us and from each other (except for our neighboring galaxies in the Local Group) because of the expansion of space. It would take the observational work of Henrietta Leavitt, Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble, and others, and well as the theoretical savvy of Georges Lemaître, to establish the general picture we now call the Big Bang. As cosmologist Edward Harrison demonstrated, the Big Bang theory elegantly explained Olbers' Paradox by mandating that before a certain cosmic era, no stars would have existed. Therefore, the patches of darkness in the sky are regions where there has not been enough time for stars (or galaxies) to form and transmit their light to us.
Hubble Space Telescope, courtesy of NASA
With a powerful optical instrument, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, we've discovered far more visible objects breaking up the regions of true darkness. Supplement that device with radio receivers and other devices that capture all parts of the spectrum, and the sky is actually full of radiation — just not visible radiation. If our eyes were sensitive to radio signals, the sky wouldn't seem dark at all, but rather a radio haze. Those radio waves constitute relic radiation leftover from the cosmic period called the Recombination Era, cooled by the expanding universe down to less than three degrees Kelvin. They can be seen through instruments such as the Planck satellite.

Poe imagined that the matter in the universe emerged from a greater unity, which was apt. However, he did not anticipate that it would be the expansion of space itself that caused such a transformation. Therefore, although Eureka is a highly imaginative work of great creative insight, it can hardly be said to have predicted the Big Bang.
On a personal note — related to the topic of cosmology — I'm greatly looking forward to Ethan's upcoming book, Beyond the Galaxy: How Humanity Looked Beyond Our Milky Way and Discovered the Entire Universe, which is due out in October. I think it is amazing how much our understanding of the vastness of the observable universe has progressed in the past century, from just a single known galaxy to an estimated more than 100 billion. Awesome indeed, in the fullest sense of the word.
GETTY Muslim women should have to remove the burka in certain circumstances, the PM said
The Prime Minister said it was reasonable for women to be asked to remove the veil in circumstances where facial identification was important - for example in court and during immigration checks. However he distanced himself from a Frecnch-style all-out ban on such coverings. Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "In our country people should be free to wear what they like.
"When you are coming into contact either with different institutions or, for instance, you are in court or you need to see someone's face at the border, then I would always back the authorities or the institutions that have put in place proper and sensible rules. "Going for the French approach of banning an item of clothing, I do not think that's the way we do things in this country and I do not think that would help."
GETTY The full-face veil is banned in various European countries
I would always back the authorities or the institutions that have put in place proper and sensible rules David Cameron
In 2013 Mr Cameron strongly backed the right of schools, courts and immigration centres to ask Muslim women to remove the traditional Islamic head dress. He said that there are certain places where women should not be allowed to wear either the niqab, which covers the face except for the eyes , or the full-length burka, which includes a mesh over the eyes. Mr Cameron cited the example of schooling, adding it was "very difficult to teach unless you can look at your pupils in the eye". The issue has been highly controversial in western Europe, with a backlash in France and Belgium where the full-face veil is banned.
France was the first country to ban the burka in public places in 2010, with anyone leaving their home with their face hidden behind a veil running the risk of a fine. The law was upheld by the European court of human rights in 2014. three years after a similar ban came into effect in Belgium. Mr Cameron has also said Muslim women must learn basic English or risk being kicked out the country, arguing such a move will help combat extremism.
GETTY Mr Cameron distanced himself from an all-out ban on burkas in public places
Writing in the Times, the Prime Minister said more assertive action is needed to end the “passive tolerance” of practices which he says leave many Muslim women facing discrimination and isolation. There are 190,000 Muslim women in England who speak little or no English, according to Government estimates. As a result Mr Cameron today launched a £20 million initiative aimed at helping Muslim women with their language skills in an attempt to integrate them into the community. He said the lack of integration in some Muslim communities had helped to foster extremism and allowed “appalling practices” such as female genital mutilation and forced marriage to take place. The Prime Minister said he would not avoid telling the “hard truths” needed to confront a minority of Muslim men whose “backward attitudes” led them to exert “damaging control” over women in their families.
“The Best baseball you ever ate.” That's the slogan of the shortbread cookie company based in Cooperstown, New York (home of the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum).
The cookie company's main product is simple short bread cookies shaped like baseballs. While on the surface, it may not seem like much, the company does a good job selling their simple treat. Each pack of two shortbread cookies comes in a small tin with the company's logo on it. Inside, in addition to the cookies, baseball fans will find trivia questions such as: What Hall of Fame pitcher won at least 20 games in five straight seasons in the 1970s (The answer to which is provided on their website is Jim “Catfish” Hunter)?
The company has been all over baseball during the past half decade with many of baseball's biggest stars, including Craig Biggio and Whitey Ford, using the Triple C for their family events. According to the company, the, “New York Yankees shared 1,200 customized tubes at the 2007 and 2008 Welcome Home Dinner,” while the, “Detroit Tigers gave 200 tins to their Season Suite holders.”
The treat has also received national recognition as it was named one of Rachael Ray's “Snacks of the Day” on her television show.
While the shortbread cookie is no doubt their trademark, the company has done a lot to revolutionize the way they sell their product. They offer many different ways to purchase their cookies from large tins to bags and even offer a program that will put a company's logo on a baseball sticker on the outside of a package of their cookies.
Their cookies come in four flavors including Classic Shortbread, All Star Almond, Boys of Summer Lemon and Mudville Mudball Chocolate Chip.
The simple shortbread cookies taste how one might expect a good shortbread cookie to taste. Their simple packaging and style seems to cater to the old school baseball fan looking for an off-the-field way to keep the game they love in their life. Their design is simple, yet presentable, and does give the impression of a company who has done their research and knows how to relate to the historic baseball community that surrounds them in Cooperstown.

Whether you chanced upon this article through a shared post in social media or have landed on this page because of a query you typed in Google, chances are you are curious to what is the meaning of overpronation and how does it concern your feet. So without further ado, let MedicalWebsite explain to you what is overpronation (on the foot). The thing is, before you can understand this foot condition, you need to know what pronation is first.
Normally, the heel of your foot is the one that carries the weight when you are standing. When you do foot activities such as walking, running, or jumping, this pressure is transferred from the heel to your forefoot or ball of foot. When this happens, your foot will roll inwards naturally. This particular foot movement is called pronation.
If such inward rolling occurs too much, this is when overpronation begins. Overpronation is the condition when the foot moves inward excessively. In such a case, the pressure is handed over to the inner side of the foot instead of the ball of foot.
Even when you are standing, if you have an overpronated foot, the weight becomes heavier on the medial side because the foot's pressure has rolled from the heel inwardly to the arch, making it look flat footed. Overpronation also manifests itself by a curvature on your ankle whenever you stand.
If the shoes you often wear have been pinned down or worn out on the inner side rather than on the heel part, then you likely have an overpronated foot already.
Why Overpronation Happens
Pronation is a natural foot movement that occurs whenever you walk or run. It becomes bad if your foot does it excessively and/or beyond the normal length of time it needs to pronate. Although it has many probable causes, medical researchers have yet to determine the pre-conditional factors of overpronation.
One common external factor that can cause hyperpronation (as overpronation is otherwise called) is constant wearing of uncomfortable shoes and improper footwear. Shoes have been proven as contributory elements to pronation. One type of shoe may cause irregular pronation to some but will be normal and suitable to others. In such a situation, it is practical to consult with a podiatry specialist who will assess if there is a need for custom orthotics to avoid excessive pronation.
Overpronation's Effect on the Rest of Your Body
Overpronation is not an injury in itself. The thing is, if you have this foot condition, you risk yourself of getting injuries and other more painful conditions such as flat feet, morton's neuroma, bunions, plantar fasciitis, and hammer toes among many others.
Because overpronation affects the base of your body and your biomechanical balance, it is more likely that you will experience agonising pain on your other body parts, such as your limb, knee, thigh, hip, and back.
When Overpronation Strikes, Your Podiatrist Comes to Your Rescue
Whether you merely suspect that your foot is overpronated or you are already enduring excruciating conditions because of overpronation, it is best that you go and have it checked by your local podiatrist immediately. To assess your condition, he or she may perform an examination procedure called Gait Analysis mainly on how you manage your walking and running, coupled with a thorough visual and manual evaluation of your foot, and x-ray (if necessary).
Treatment for an overpronated foot, usually involves the podiatrist requiring the patient to wear a customised orthotic directly aimed at correcting the disorder. In case overpronation has incurred other conditions or injuries, the podiatrist will do further assessments and apply the necessary treatments, which may include (but will not be limited to) casting or surgery, depending on the diagnosis and result of the examinations.

HOUSTON - A SWAT situation involving a driver barricaded inside an 18-wheeler ended with an arrest Friday in northwest Houston.
Officers tried to stop the driver of the big rig just before 2:30 a.m., who was driving erratically and going the wrong way with the headlights off, police said. After a short chase, the driver stopped in the 4900 block of Ella.
“When Officers approached he displayed a large knife and then began acting erratically, getting into his cab changing clothes, laying his head on the steering wheel, not responding to officers verbal commands,” HPD spokesperson Keses Smith said
Police said the driver barricaded himself inside the cab of the truck with a knife but surrendered after a short time. Police took the man into custody.
"HPD deployed gas inside the cab, which prompted the suspect to exit without incident and he was arrested and taken into custody," Smith said.
A SWAT officer said paramedics checked the 32-year-old man out once he was out of the truck. He was not hurt.
The driver was being evaluated to determine whether he'll be sent to a psychiatric center or jail, police said.

Ugly scenes as police beat prominent activist and detain dozens more demostrators who want Beijing to allow democratic election
Hundreds of Hong Kong police officers drove protesters from a tunnel in the dead of night in the worst violence since the street demonstrations for greater democracy began more than two weeks ago.
Officers, many with riot shields and wielding pepper spray, dragged away dozens of protesters, tore down barricades and removed concrete slabs the protesters used as road blocks around the underpass.
The clampdown comes amid increasing impatience in Beijing over the political crisis in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. A front-page editorial on Wednesday in the People's Daily of the ruling Communist party's condemned the protests and said “they are doomed to fail”.
“Facts and history tell us that radical and illegal acts that got their way only result in more severe illegal activities, exacerbating disorder and turmoil,” the commentary said, referring to the activists.
“Stability is bliss and turmoil brings havoc.”
The operation came hours after a large group of demonstrators blockaded the tunnel, expanding their protest zone after being cleared out of some other streets. The protesters outnumbered the police officers, who later returned with reinforcements to clear the area.
Officers took away many protesters, their hands tied with plastic cuffs, and pushed others out to a nearby park.
Police said they had to disperse the protesters because they were disrupting public order and gathering illegally. They arrested 45 activists during the clashes, which police said injured four officers.
“I have to stress here that even though protesters raised their hands in their air it does not mean it was a peaceful protest,” said the spokesman, Tsui Wai-Hung. He said some protesters kicked the officers and attacked them with umbrellas.
Local television channel TVB showed footage of around six police officers taking a man around the side of a building, placing him on the ground and kicking him. Legislators and activists identified the protester as Ken Tsang, a member of a local pro-democracy political party who in 2012 interrupted Leung's inauguration by heckling then-Chinese president Hu Jintao.

Hong Kong's security chief said the officers involved had been reassigned to other posts and the department was carrying out an investigation.
The student-led protesters are into their third week of occupying key parts of the city to pressure its government over curbs recommended by Beijing on democratic reforms.
They oppose plans for a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates to run in Hong Kong's first direct elections to choose a leader, called a chief executive, in 2017. They also want the current chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, to resign.
Leung has said there is “almost zero chance” that China's government will change its rules for the election.
Positions on both sides have been hardening since the government called off negotiations last week, citing the unlikelihood of a constructive outcome given their sharp differences.
The demonstrations have posed an unprecedented challenge to the government. Organizers say as many as 200,000 people thronged the streets for peaceful sit-ins after police used tear gas on 28 September to disperse unarmed protesters. The numbers have since dwindled.
Police have chipped away at the protest zones in three areas across the city by removing barricades from around the edges. On Tuesday they used chainsaws and sledgehammers to tear them down.
Beijing is eager to end the protests to avoid emboldening activists and others on the mainland seen as a threat to the Communist party's monopoly on power.
In a statement from the central government's liaison office in Hong Kong, director Zhang Xiaoming told city legislators at a banquet on Tuesday that the protest movement “is a serious social and political incident that has violated the ‘one country' principle, challenged the central authority” and was “an illegal activity that openly violates Hong Kong's current law”.
“It has not only brought to Hong Kong economic losses in tens of millions of yuan, affected the livelihood of vast numbers of citizens, but also hurt the basis of Hong Kong's rule of law, democratic development, social harmony, international image and its relations with the mainland,” Zhang said, calling for the movement to be ended as soon as possible.
What is the Irish language? Is it the language of the Irish? Well, no, that is English.
Is it known as Irish by its native speakers? Well, no, they call it Gaeilge.
Letter to the editor
And what does Gaeilge mean? Is it a Gaelic word? Well, no, it is a Brittonic or Welsh word and not Gaelic at all, but it does mean Gaelic and not Irish.
So what is the Irish language? Well, it is an artificial language formulated by de Valera's translation department as the mental tool for a new Irish national life.
That is what the Shinners will use it for.
Amid all this talk of respect, what do DUP politicians know about the Irish language? Well, nothing – except that an Irish Language Act, if it happened, would be the last act of betrayal of the Ulster people.
Former Lord Mayor of Belfast Ian Adamson OBE. Picture Presseye
To me, as a language enthusiast,it would also be a betrayal of Ulster Gaelic by making de Valera Gaelic a cultural imperative, enforced by law.

Take the 101 to the 134 to the 10. Adding definite articles in front of every highway, freeway, and interstate must sound like an affectation to out-of-town ears. So why do California drivers talk like that?
It's not only those drawling, car-obsessed Pacific Coasters who can't stop adding “the” to their roads. The transpo-idiom can be heard on roads all over the West, from Utah to Nevada to Arizona. And it's not an affectation; there's a reason for it, according to Nathan Masters over at KCET, related to the region's long-standing love affair with the private automobile.
Take Los Angeles, where the practice of adding “the” to highway numbers is probably most acute. By 1956, when the Federal Aid Highway Act spread high-volume, automobile-only routes all over the country, L.A. had already built a ton of roads. The city's early freeways were local routes, Masters writes, “engineered to carry local traffic and (partly) paid for by local funds.” Rather than be known by an anonymous pair of federally designated digits, these freeways were named after the places they passed through or ended.

On Wednesday, Dec. 16, the city of Arlington announced plans for a future entertainment project estimated at $200 million to be built by Globe Life Park. The venture is to make "the first step of what we will be many steps" in Arlington, according to Blake Cordish, a vice president at The Cordish Companies., the firm that is helping the production. Here are five things to know about the new project, known as Texas Live!
1. Goodbye, A Lot

Ranger fans will be gaining an entertainment center but losing prime parking spots. The development will be in Rangers Lot A in the southwest corner of Nolan Ryan Expressway and East Randol Mill Road.
2. Teamwork

The development includes a 100,000-square-foot entertainment complex, a 300-room hotel and 35,000-square-foot convention center annex. Expect the entertainment complex to be finished in 2017 and the hotel to start construction ini 2018.
4. St. Louis views

Arlington isn't getting these facilities for free, but there might be some jobs in it for its citizens. The city is expected to offer $50 million to the project, and hotel tax breaks could cost Arlington another $50 million.

Plot
Undercover Cop Dee ignites a secret deep inside himself after a car accident but he hardly recognizes. When his undercover mission is about to succeed, a mysterious killer messes it all up. Just at the moment Dee is facing between live and death, he is shocked by the fact that the killer whom his girifriend has a crush on, is no one else but himself.
Notes
Psychedelic Cop attained the dubious distinction of being one of the biggest box office flops in Hong Kong cinema history. During its one-week run at a cinema in the Fanling District in 2002, the movie attracted less than 10 viewers and made a total of $42 (RM159).
Cast
Michael Cohen offers a useful reminder that the world is still mostly much more secure and peaceful than it used to be:
Worst of all, the constant calls for a quick and usually muscular response to perceived national security threats gives Americans a false sense of insecurity. The fact is, while people may be relentlessly, breathlessly trying to make us believe that we're on the cusp of World War III, the world is actually pretty safe. From Latin America and Europe to the Far East and broad swathes of sub-Saharan Africa, most of the world is at peace. While 2014 has been a particularly violent year, we are nonetheless in the midst of a more than two-decade-long decline in the number of wars and their lethality.
It suits many interventionists to insist that the world is exceedingly dangerous, because this tends to inspire panic and overreaction in Western capitals, and that can make hard-line policies seem more appealing. It is easier to win support for resorting to the use of force by carelessly throwing around warnings about “imminent” and “existential” threats that are in reality neither imminent nor existential. If one assumes that “the world” is in chaos, that makes it a bit easier to sell the idea that the U.S. must restore order in various parts of the world. It doesn't seem to matter that the U.S. stake in current conflicts is actually very small, or that far worse and bloodier conflicts have taken place around the world during earlier eras when the U.S. was supposedly demonstrating more “leadership.”
Hawks promote the false belief that “the world” is on fire because they believe that this makes otherwise awful and unpopular hawkish policies more attractive, and it also saves them from having to account for the fact that these policies have a record of making foreign conflicts worse. Having spent years lying about a supposed U.S. “retreat” from the world that never happened, hawks are eager to seize on any bad news overseas as “proof” of what comes from “retreat.” Some of this is just bad-faith partisan sniping, and some of it comes from an ideological commitment to the idea that U.S. hegemony is essential to international peace and security, and the rest is the usual inability to keep a sense of proportion about foreign threats. Whatever may be behind it, these claims should be greeted with extreme skepticism and should be taken as a warning that those making them are trying to sell you something you would normally reject.
Almost 10 prisoners a month kill themselves in UK jails, with much of the blame placed on neglect and costcutting. That is what led to the death of Dean Saunders, according to his family – and a jury has agreed
About two weeks before Dean Saunders killed himself in his prison cell, a manager from the private company running healthcare in the prison was heard to express concerns about the cost of keeping prisoners under constant suicide watch, according to evidence presented at his inquest. Monitoring of Saunders's cell was subsequently reduced. On 4 January 2016, in between the checks made on his cell, he succeeded in taking his own life. An inquest into his death last week concluded that “financial consideration” had played a “significant” part in the decision to reduce the level of observations.
Building more prisons is not the answer | Letters Read more
But so many other things went wrong during the 18 days Saunders was in prison that this catastrophic decision was just one of many that led to the death of a seriously ill young father who had never previously been to jail, and should not have been in prison. The jury found neglect contributed to his death.
Last year, a record number of prisoners committed suicide in jails in England and Wales, with at least 113 recorded, nearly 10 a month (the number may prove higher still when the Ministry of Justice releases the final figures on Thursday). Campaigners for prison reform see this as the inevitable consequence of the overcrowded, underfunded and understaffed prison system. Despite a multitude of damning inquest verdicts, excoriating prison inspection reports and thoughtful reviews into what should be done, there has been no concerted action to address the issue.
“There's no political will. Dead prisoners do not win votes,” Deborah Coles, the director of the deaths in custody campaign group Inquest, says wearily, acknowledging that she is angry at the soaring numbers and exhausted by the lack of progress.
But Saunders' parents, Donna and Mark, and his partner Clare Hobday-Saunders have a stubborn determination to pull something constructive out his death. Still shaken by the findings of the inquest last Friday, they are nevertheless preparing for a meeting with the prisons minister Sam Gyimah to confront him with the case for change. Meanwhile, they have rallied themselves to talk in detail about the ways in which Dean was failed. Clare has taken holiday from her job at a phone shop, and Donna and Mark, both bus drivers, are also on leave this week so that they can try to get attention focused on what happened to Dean, who was 25 when he died.
As they explain what happened, it becomes clear that his story charts the tragic collision of two national crises: one in the mental health system and a second in the prison system.
“I know I am just a nobody, but I feel responsible,” Mark Saunders says at Clare's flat in Basildon, Essex, in a conversation punctuated by the happy babble of Clare and Dean's two-year-old son, who is serving his grandparents wooden bits of food, cooked in his toy oven. “There is a culture that what happens in those prison walls stays in those walls. The only way we can change it, is if we get people to look in and understand what is happening.”

Until December 2015, Dean's life was fairly unremarkable. He had a stable, happy family set-up, and was the main carer for his baby son, while Clare went to work. All the family photos show the two of them together; Clare says they were inseparable. But in December, he had an unexpected and unexplained serious mental health crisis, and went home to his parents for a couple of days. While he was there his behaviour became increasingly paranoid. Suddenly convinced his family had turned against him, he picked up a bread knife and tried to cut his brother's throat. Luckily, the injuries were relatively minor.
His father wrestled the knife out of his son's hand. In the fracas that followed, Dean picked up a second knife from the kitchen table and attempted to cut his own throat. As Mark tried to prevent his son from harming himself, he was stabbed in the stomach with the knife. Moments later, Dean asked his father why he was holding him down. “He said: ‘Dad, I'd never hurt you. I love you.' It was as if he wasn't aware of what had happened,” Mark says. He had never been violent before.
The police were called, and charged Dean with two counts of attempted murder, but assured his family that they understood he was very unwell, and that he would be transferred to a hospital. However, there was no bed at the appropriate secure hospital, and instead he was taken to Chelmsford prison. The family had no desire to press charges, and they were promised repeatedly by the police that he would be safe and well looked after.
Everyone acknowledges now that Saunders should not have been sent to prison; it was a temporary measure because there was no hospital bed. He had told his family that he was going to kill himself; notes were sent explaining to prison staff that he was a high suicide risk, and that he should be under constant observation.
The prisons and probation ombudsman review into his death notes that staff were concerned about his paranoid behaviour: he thought the staff had microphones in their hair and cameras in their glasses. He put a plastic bag over his head in his cell, and threatened to pour a kettle of boiling water on to his head. Later, he wanted to see the chaplain to discuss his funeral plans; he talked about wanting a lethal injection to speed things up.
First thing on the Monday morning after his admission to prison, staff held an ACCT (assessment, care in custody and teamwork) meeting, to determine how he would be looked after. There was no progress on the transfer to hospital. The inquest jury found that the head of healthcare, working for Care UK, the private company that had the contract to run healthcare in the prison, had “to a very large extent predetermined” the decision to reduce monitoring of Dean's cell before she went into a meeting to assess his needs. The official denied this claim during the hearing as well as the suggestion that she took costs into consideration.
When Clare and Donna visited on 23 December, they were very worried by Dean's behaviour. He told them that the prison staff were planning to kill him; he said he had seen gas cannisters and a chair where staff were going to perform a live autopsy on him. The meeting was cut short because Dean was very suspicious of them.
They were so worried that they asked to see someone caring for him. They met a mental health nurse, who said they thought they were building up trust. When Donna rang later to check that he was being watched and to reiterate her concerns, she found out that this had been reduced to half-hourly checks. The family called the prison 20 times over the period Dean was in Chelmsford, anxious to find out about his state of mind, and hoping that staff would pass on messages of love and support to him; they are not sure that the messages got through. They were distressed he had not called them, but during the inquest it emerged that he had asked staff repeatedly for their numbers so he could call, and had not been given them.

When Clare asked for her number to be given to Dean, it was noted down against the wrong prisoner in the logs. “All the time we were told: ‘He is safe, he is secure, don't worry,'” Clare says. “I don't think our messages were passed on. We feel horrified that he spent those last days feeling abandoned by those who loved him.”
Over Christmas, there was no progress in the transfer to hospital. The psychiatrist was on holiday. Dean refused to take medication and his condition got worse. On 4 January, a family liaison officer visited Clare at her parents' home to tell her that Dean had killed himself.
“All the way through, we were treated wrongly and so was he,” she says. “There should be another pathway for people who are mentally unwell. He should have been in hospital, instead he was caged in a Victorian-style prison over Christmas, not able to speak to his family.”
The family has had sorry-for-your-loss-style condolence messages from the prison and from Care UK, but no formal apology – which upsets and surprises them. In statements, the Ministry of Justice and Care UK acknowledge mistakes were made.
“HMP Chelmsford have already put in place a number of measures to better support offenders suffering from mental health problems following the PPO investigation into the death of Mr Saunders, and we will now carefully consider the findings of the inquest,” the Ministry of Justice said in an emailed statement.
They added that £14m had been invested to provide 400 extra staff members in the country's 10 most challenging prisons, which includes Chelmsford. The MoJ notes that the prison was awarded £164,000 last June, which has gone to pay for a “dedicated safety custody manager” and also for “provision of in-cell activity packs for those at risk of self-harm – mindfulness activities such as puzzles, jigsaws”.
In a statement, Care UK “offers its condolences” and adds that prison was not the right place for Dean Saunders. “It is hugely regrettable that a place in a secure specialist mental hospital was not found when Mr Saunders was at the police station.”
Care UK's medical director for health in justice, Dr Sarah Bromley, says that any decision on how frequently a prisoner should be observed would have been made collectively between healthcare and prison staff. “The healthcare input to the decisions should not be influenced in any way by financial considerations. It is unacceptable if this is the case. As a result of the inquest's finding, Care UK is reviewing its processes and policies.”
An Independent Monitoring Board inspection of Chelmsford prison published this month noted that the “level of service being provided to care for prisoners' physical and mental health needs remains inadequate”. It highlighted Care UK's difficulties with recruiting and retaining staff and its reliance on agency staff “to cover clinical vacancies”. It also states that across the prison, “government budgetary cuts have continued and reflect a much lower number of officers”. The latest prison inspection also said that healthcare provision at Chelmsford was inadequate and had got worse since the last inspection, exacerbated by staff shortages.
Reading between the lines of the Care UK condolence statement, there is some attempt to shift responsibility back to the Ministry of Justice. The company suggests that it is impossible to provide good healthcare when the prison is understaffed, and goes on to say it has decided to stop working at Chelmsford prison, indicating that it was not possible to do its job properly in an environment where a prison is understaffed. The company will leave Chelmsford in May.
Deborah Coles of Inquest is shocked by clear link between budget pressure and the downgrading of Dean's suicide watch: “It is absolutely scandalous – this pursuit of profit overriding the duty of care to a vulnerable prisoner. You could not have had a more vulnerable prisoner; everyone had accepted him as one, it was marked clearly on his notes. If you can't protect someone like him, who can you protect? Sadly this is not an isolated case. Until they radically reduce the prison population this will continue.
Mark says he feels there was a “toxic mix of understaffing, inadequate training, inadequate information, complacency, lack of passing information between all of them”. He feels despondent when he reads accounts of other deaths in Chelmsford prison and elsewhere in the prison estate. “There are clear patterns. If someone died on your watch, surely you would do everything you can to stop it happening again. It is almost as if it is an accepted part of prison life that someone is going to die.”
Clare is still struggling to come to terms with the conclusion that the death was “predictable and preventable”. “If only the people responsible for keeping him safe had simply done their jobs, then Dean would be alive today. He was a very proud dad. Life was just really beginning for him.”

"Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year."
The debate over the legalization of marijuana is a lively one, with strong opinions on either side.
In a recent commentary in The Providence Journal, James Aubin, the founder of pro-legalization group Common Sense Citizen, argued for the legalization of marijuana in Rhode Island, saying it could boost the state's sagging economy.
He included an impressive statistic about the revenue Colorado was bringing in from marijuana sales.
"Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year, plus saved most if not all of the $145 million the Harvard report estimated it spent each year fighting marijuana," Aubin wrote in the Jan. 5, 2015, piece.
(The Harvard report he mentioned was "The Budgetary Implications of Drug Prohibition," a 2010 study by professor Jeffrey Miron. He estimated that Rhode Island spends $40 million annually fighting marijuana.)
We decided to focus on the first half of his statement, dealing with Colorado revenue.
We asked Aubin where he got his numbers. He responded that he relied on the State of Colorado's Department of Revenue, as well as a story from Channel 7-KMGH, the Denver ABC News affiliate.
We pulled Colorado's tax records ourselves. We added up the monthly figures, from Jan. 1, 2014, when the first recreational marijuana stores opened, through Oct. 31, the most recent report.
We determined that the state's total marijuana tax revenue was about $60 million.
The revenue comes from a 2.9-percent retail and medical marijuana sales tax; a 10-percent retail marijuana special sales tax; and a 15-percent marijuana excise tax, plus application and license fees for retail and medical marijuana.
In other words, Aubin got his number right. We were curious about where the money went.
Colorado tax records show that a portion of the revenue from marijuana retail sales is distributed to local governments where stores are located, including Denver and the ski resort towns of Breckenridge and Telluride, based on tax revenue brought in from marijuana sales in those communities. Denver, for example, received $128,586.
Most of the money goes into the state general fund. But voters dedicated the first $40 million in excise taxes annually to a statewide school construction fund, administered by the state Department of Education. So far, that tax has generated $10 million for the fund.
The monthly revenue from marijuana has increased steadily. In January, the total collected in taxes and fee was $3.5 million; in October, it was $7.6 million.
We also looked at news articles about the tax implications of legalizing marijuana. One, by Associated Press writer Kristen Wyatt, reports that estimate for tax potential from marijuana sales vary widely. States with legalized recreational marijuana sales could see their revenue drop as more states move to legalize.
Another story, by Associated Press reporter Gene Johnson, detailed how tax revenues from legal sales of marijuana were being undercut by regular users buying medical or black-market marijuana to avoid the higher taxes.
Officials in Colorado and Washington, two of the four states that have legalized sale of recreational marijuana, are considering ways to rein in the medical marijuana system and to reduce the tax differential between medical and retail sales.
For the record, Rhode Island legalized medical marijuana in 2006. In 2013, it decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical marijuana; anyone caught with up to one ounce is subject to a $150 fine instead of facing a misdemeanor criminal charge.
Our ruling
James Aubin wrote that "Colorado raked in $60 million in marijuana taxes and licensing fees in the past year …".
Documents we reviewed from the Colorado Department of Revenue showed that total marijuana revenue from taxes and fees was about $60 million between Jan. 1 through Oct. 31, 2014.
Of course, this figure tells only part of the story about Colorado's legalization of marijuana. There are also costs, including administrative expenses and societal costs yet to be determined. But those are beyond the scope of this fact-check.
Lady Gaga's Super Bowl halftime show performance on Feb. 5 scored huge sales gains for the diva, according to Nielsen Music.
Based on initial sales reports collected for Sunday, the diva sold about 150,000 digital albums and songs in the U.S. on Feb. 5 -- an increase of a little more than 1,000 percent compared to the previous day, when she sold around 15,000 digital albums and songs.
Also impressive: On Super Bowl Sunday alone, Gaga sold more songs and albums digitally than she did in the entire week ending Feb. 2 -- across both physical and digital formats. In the week ending Feb. 2, Gaga sold 30,000 albums and songs, of which 26,000 were digital.
Gaga's 13-minute halftime performance included all three of her No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (“Just Dance,” “Poker Face” and “Born This Way”) along with top 10 tunes “Telephone” and “Bad Romance,” and recent single “Million Reasons.”
In total on Sunday, Gaga sold over 125,000 song downloads -- up about 960 percent compared to the previous day (a little more than 10,000 sold). Her biggest-selling song on Feb. 5 was “Million Reasons,” which sold more than 45,000 downloads -- up nearly 900 percent compared to the previous day (about 5,000).
Further, with just one day of sales, “Million Reasons” scores its best sales week ever. So far, the song -- which was released last October -- saw its best sales frame in the week ending Dec. 8, 2016, when it sold 44,000 from all digital retailers.
On Super Bowl Sunday, Gaga also tallied big gains with “Bad Romance” (up 1,525 percent to over 13,000 downloads), “Born This Way” (up 2,202 percent to over 12,000) and “Poker Face” (up 1,217 percent to 10,000).
“Million Reasons” is from Gaga's most recent album, Joanne, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart dated Nov. 12, 2016. Joanne was Gaga's biggest-selling digital album on Super Bowl Sunday, with over 12,000 sold (up 1,077 percent compared to its previous day: a little more than 1,000). Notably, Joanne hasn't sold this much in a single week since the frame ending Dec. 29, 2016, when it moved 18,000 copies (both physical and digital).
Gaga's second-biggest selling digital album on Sunday was The Fame Monster -- home to both "Bad Romance" and "Telephone" -- with about 6,000 sold (up from nearly nothing the previous day).
Overall, Gaga's catalog of albums sold more than 23,000 downloads on Feb. 5 -- up 1,395 percent compared to the previous day (nearly 2,000).
It's expected that the sales surge Gaga is seeing from her Super Bowl halftime performance will continue on through the days following the game, leading to impact on Billboard's charts dated Feb. 25 (reflecting sales data for the week ending Feb. 9).
A year ago, Coldplay headlined the Super Bowl halftime show (Feb. 7, 2016) and saw a handsome increase in sales for its albums and songs in the week of the performance. In the week ending Feb. 11, 2016, Coldplay sold 95,000 albums (up 355 percent) and 254,000 digital songs (up 174 percent). The band's then-just-released album A Head Full of Dreams flew back up the Billboard 200 chart dated Feb. 20, rising from No. 16 to No. 4 in the wake of the halftime show.
A simple yard sign just wasn't enough for one Donald Trump supporter.
In a project that took about five hours to complete, 69-year-old Wally Maslowsky mowed a massive T-R-U-M-P into his lawn in Almont, Michigan.
Maslowsky, who retired from General Motors 10 years ago, told MLive that the “sign” measures 58,000 square feet on his 10-acre property.
He said he just did it to keep busy and to show his support for the Republican nominee, not to draw publicity.
“I guess when you're retired you do stuff to keep busy,” Maslowsky said. “You either go sit by the TV and go nuts, or you go out and make work for yourself. It keeps you young.”
The massive display has gone viral in recent days after Maslowsky's son took a drone video of it.

Exclusive: US and UK intercepts could hold answer to 1961 accident in Africa that killed Dag Hammarskjöld and 15 others
A UN report into the death of its former secretary general Dag Hammarskjöld in a 1961 plane crash in central Africa has found that there is a “significant amount of evidence” that his flight was brought down by another aircraft.
The report, delivered to the current secretary general, António Guterres, last month, took into account previously undisclosed information provided by the US, UK, Belgian, Canadian and German governments.
Its author, Mohamed Chande Othman, a former Tanzanian chief justice, found that the US and UK governments had intercepted radio traffic in the area at the time and suggested that the 56-year-old mystery could be solved if the contents of those classified recordings were produced.
“I am indebted for the assistance that I received, which uncovered a large amount of valuable new information,” Othman said in an executive summary of his report, seen by the Guardian. “I can confidently state that the deeper we have gone into the searches, the more relevant information has been found.”

Hammarskjöld, a Swedish diplomat who became the UN secretary general in 1953, was on a mission in September 1961 to try to broker peace in Congo, where the Katanga region had staged a rebellion, backed by mining interests and European mercenaries, against the newly independent government in Kinshasa.
His plane, a Douglas DC-6, was on the way from Kinshasa to the town of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where the British colonial authorities were due to host talks with the Katanga rebels. It was approaching the airstrip at about midnight on 17 September when it crashed, killing Hammarskjöld and 15 others on board.
Two inquiries run by the British pointed to pilot error as the cause, while a UN commission in 1962 reached an open verdict. In recent years, independent research by Göran Björkdahl, a Swedish aid worker, and Susan Williams, a senior fellow at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies in London and author of a 2011 book Who Killed Hammarskjöld?, persuaded the UN to reopen the case. A panel convened in 2015 found there was enough new material to warrant the appointment of an “eminent person” to assess it. Othman was given the job in February this year.
Among Othman's new findings are:
In February 1961, the French secretly supplied three Fouga warplanes to the Katanga rebels, “against the objections of the US government”. Contrary to previous findings, they were used in air-to-air attacks, flown at night and from unpaved airstrips in Katanga.
Fresh evidence bolsters an account by a French diplomat, Claude de Kemoularia, that he had been told in 1967 by a Belgian pilot known as Beukels, who had been flying for the rebels as a mercenary, that he had fired warning shots to try to divert the plane away from Ndola and accidentally clipped its wing. Othman said he was unable to establish Beukels' identity in the time available for his inquiry.
The UK and Rhodesian authorities were intercepting UN communications at the time of the crash and had intelligence operatives in the area. The UK should therefore have potentially crucial evidence in its classified archives
The US had sophisticated electronic surveillance aircraft “in and around Ndola” as well as spies, and defence officials, on the night of the crash, and Washington should be able to provide more detailed information.
Othman found that earlier inquiries had disregarded the testimony of local witnesses who said they saw another plane and flashes in the sky on the night of Hammarskjold's crash. They had also “undervalued” the testimony of Harold Julien, a security officer who survived for several days who told medical staff he had seen “sparks in the sky” shortly before the DC-6, known by its registration number SE-BDY, fell out of the sky.
“Based on the totality of the information we have at hand, it appears plausible that external attack or threat may have been a cause of the crash, whether by way of direct attack causing SE-BDY to crash, or by causing a momentary distraction of the pilots,” Othman concludes.
“There is a significant amount of evidence from eyewitnesses that they observed more than one aircraft in the air, that the other aircraft may have been a jet, that SE-BDY was on fire before it crashed, and/or that SE-BDY was fired upon or otherwise actively engaged by another aircraft. In its totality, this evidence is not easily dismissed.”
Othman argues that the “burden of proof” was now on member states “to show that they have conducted a full review of records and archives in their custody or possession, including those that remain classified, for potentially relevant information”.
The Tanzanian judge said that the most relevant pieces of information were radio intercepts and called for countries likely to have relevant information, such as the UK and US, to appoint an “independent and high-ranking official” to comb the archives.
“Any such information regarding what occurred during the last minutes of SE-BDY, if verifiable, will be likely to either prove or disprove one or more of the existing hypotheses, bringing us more proximate to closure,” Othman writes.
“This is a step that must be taken before this matter, and the memories of those who perished on flight SE-BDY in the service of the organisation, may rest.”
The region's high housing costs are deterring top talent from entering the Los Angeles job market and leading to higher recruiting costs for employers, according to a survey released Wednesday from USC and the Los Angeles Business Council.
The study, authored by Raphael Bostic, a USC Price School of Public Policy professor and newly-appointed head of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, found that 75 percent of employers surveyed cited the region's high housing costs as a negative impact on employee retention. Nearly two-thirds of major employers surveyed said they are forced to include cost of living adjustments when negotiating hiring packages for top-level employees.
In addition, the survey found that as employees have had to go farther afield to find affordable housing, nearly every employer reported that more than 25 percent of their employees spent more than 90 minutes getting to and from work.
“This study shows that high housing costs are burdening our leading employers, either by having to develop special hiring packages, or subsidizing transportation and relocation costs,” Bostic said in a press release accompanying the study. “Though we have yet to see a critical mass of businesses priced out of the region, this is an area of concern. There's ample evidence to show that the time is now to implement strategies to reduce housing costs.”
The report attributes the high cost of housing to the region's limited housing supply. Among the recommendations to increase housing supply are investing in higher-density housing at a range of prices near key transit centers, reducing parking requirements for new development, identifying single-story buildings that could be converted to housing, and examining successful employer-sponsored housing projects, such as the LAUSD affordable housing apartments completed last year.
To compile the survey data, USC researchers questioned employers accounting for nearly 200,000 jobs across a wide array of sectors, including utilities, health care, education, government, engineering, and finance.

A huge cannabis factory has been uncovered at Legoland - apparently planted by someone sneaking in from the Queen's estate.
Police found 50 of the chest-high plants being cultivated under heat lamps and an irrigation system in a bungalow at the park in Windsor.
But theme park bosses say the vacant building is inaccessible to the public and “appears to have been accessed via the Crown Estate” - land belonging to the Queen.
Astonished workers discovered the professional set up while looking for asbestos in what is understood to be derelict staff accommodation yesterday.
A spokeswoman for Legoland said: “Following routine checks, we can confirm that illegal substances were found in a derelict cottage outside of the LEGOLAND Park boundary.
“The building in question is inaccessible to the public and appears to have been accessed via the Crown Estate.
“We have notified Thames Valley Police and we will continue to support their ongoing investigation.”
The cottage containing the plants is on the 215 acres owned by Legoland, but outside the theme park boundary.
It is situated near the entrance to the park and kennels where visitors can leave their dogs.
A spokesman for the police said: “Thames Valley Police officers were called at about 11.15am today following reports that cannabis had been found at a property in the Legoland grounds in Windsor.
“Officers are currently at the site where cannabis plants and equipment used in the production of cannabis has been located.
“No arrests have been made and an investigation is being carried out.”

WASHINGTON — Security firm IntelCrawler said Friday that it has identified a Russian teenager as the author of the malware probably used in the cyberattacks against Target and Neiman Marcus, and that it expects more retailers to acknowledge that their systems were breached.
In a report posted online, the Sherman Oaks, Calif., company said the author of the malware used in the attacks has sold more than 60 versions of the software to cybercriminals in Eastern Europe and other countries.
The firm said the 17-year-old has roots in St. Petersburg. He reportedly has a reputation as a ‘‘very well known'' programmer in underground marketplaces for malicious code, the report said.

The company said the teenager did not perpetrate the attacks, but that he wrote the malicious programs — software known as BlackPOS — used to infect the sales systems at Target and Neiman Marcus. Andrew Komarov, the chief executive of IntelCrawler, said the attackers who bought the software entered retailers' systems by trying several easy passwords to access the registers remotely.

‘‘It seems that retailers still use quite easy passwords on most remote-access'' servers, Komarov said.
He added that there do not appear to be many restrictions on who has access to the remote point-of-sale servers in numerous companies. This, he said, could enable hackers to gain access to a prime target: back-office servers where criminals can pick up pools of data from multiple stores.
Target declined to comment on the report. Neiman Marcus spokeswoman Ginger Reeder said that she has heard no claim about weak passwords from anyone with direct knowledge of the retailers' system.
A Virginia couple was surprised after receiving a letter their son sent almost 11 years ago while serving in Iraq.
The Roanoke Times reports David Craig got the letter last week from his son Lynn Craig, who returned safely from Iraq in September 2005.
The missing letter, dated March 14, 2005, was written about a month after Lynn Craig had been in Iraq. At that time, he was a lance corporal of the U.S. Marine Corps. He's still part of the Reserve.
The Craigs say they'd like to know where the letter has been all this time.
U.S. Postal Service spokesman Tad Kelley says there's no way of knowing what happened in transit from Iraq to Roanoke, Virginia, adding it's very rare for letters to go missing for that long.
Who will join rookie Jonas Folger at the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 team in MotoGP next season?
Pol Espargaro currently rides alongside Bradley Smith, who is heading for KTM, while the likes of Moto2 star Alex Rins have long been linked to the team.
With rumours swirling, Crash.net sat down with Tech 3 boss Herve Poncharal on Sunday evening at his home Le Mans round to get the latest on the available M1 seat, plus the newly-announced deal with Folger.
"I would love to retain Pol," began Poncharal. "Because I like Pol, he is a very nice guy, always a team player and I think his level is better than his results. And he showed this weekend [fifth place] that he is fast.
"Will he stay? I don't know. I fully understand that he wants a factory [team] ride. It is his third year with Tech 3 and if he stays with us forever he will be a satellite rider. So he is now trying to get a factory Yamaha, Honda, Ducati or Suzuki.
"I told him: 'Go. Hopefully you'll have it. If you find something I'll be happy for you, but sad for me. That is life and I understand you want to make the last step'. But I think the rider line-up for the four top factory teams will be clear quite soon. For me by Barcelona everything will be fixed. That is my feeling.
"But I also said: 'I'm not going to do anything until you tell me, 'Herve I've signed for factory X. Or I've talked to all the factories and there is no room for me, can we talk?''
"So until he either says to me 'can we talk?' or 'I'm gone', I'm going to wait.
"If he is not with us next year, do we want an experienced rider or another rookie? I don't know yet. We have to explore all the options. The situation is that you have four factories - Honda, Yamaha, Ducati, Suzuki - who are the priority and will get the best riders. So now we have to wait until they are full.
"Once they are full we will be able to see who is left. And maybe there will be a name that we don't think is going to be left - a big name - and that could be very exciting for us. I always remember when we had the Crutchlow-Dovizioso line-up, it was incredibly successful. It was a really strong season...
"I'm not in a hurry. I wanted to sign Jonas because he had some other opportunities and for me it is important to secure at least one seat. And the second seat for the moment is for Pol. But I know this is not his priority."
Espargaro, whose contract is directly with Yamaha, is currently sixth and the top satellite rider in the MotoGP standings.
'Rins only wants to talk to factory teams'
Folger, a double Moto2 race winner, was announced as a 2017 Tech 3 rider earlier in the Le Mans weekend. The 22-year-old German has qualified on the front row in three out of the five events this season, and taken two podiums, but France was probably his worst weekend of the year.
"Jonas had a bad weekend with some crashes, so I hope this is not the MotoGP signature effect! Joking aside, why did I choose Jonas? I think, as I've said before, you have four riders who are more-or-less dominant in the Moto2 class," Poncharal said.
"They are: Sam Lowes, who has a three-year deal, starting with Gresini in Moto2 this year and then Aprilia in MotoGP. Johann Zarco, who has signed something with Suzuki. He cannot talk to any other manufacturer. The next is Alex Rins, but Rins is telling everybody that he only wants to talk to factory teams. He says he has a good chance to go to a factory team. We are not a factory team so it means we can't talk to him. We are too small!
"Then the fourth guy is Jonas, which doesn't mean he was our fourth choice. Jonas is a guy I like a lot. He is a genuinely nice guy. My team has always been like a family and he will fit in really well. He is not somebody who says 'I want a factory team...' I think he is fast. His riding style could, and should, be quite efficient on the M1. And the bottom line is that you have to choose somebody and Jonas was my choice.
"Is it going to be a success? In Moto3 Aleix Marquez and Alex Rins were the same speed, then they switched to Moto2 and Rins is a lot better and faster. Nobody could predict such a big gap when they changed class. Marc Marquez, Vinales, Pol Espargaro when they switched from Moto2 to MotoGP were instantly fast. but Tito Rabat is struggling a lot more. So you never know.
"But if Jonas is fast next year, everybody will say 'Herve is a genius! He can spot the talented young riders!' And if not everybody will say 'Herve is stupid!' Like a French guy who just said to me, 'You should have talked to Zarco, Jonas is good at nothing'. We will see.
"I am confident. You know, Bradley is leaving so I had to make a choice. As I say, when you make a choice you never know if it will be a complete success but Yamaha, my partners and my team support this decision."
Poncharal added that he had been talking to Folger since 2014, "but it was a bit too early. This is his third year in Moto2 and I think now is the right moment. I know he is not dominating Moto2, but he is fast. He's 22, still young. And if he is going to make the move it is now.
"So we have an opportunity, he has the will, he is ready, he has the experience. So why not?"
Laurie Zabawa says she'd been working at a Hilton Garden Inn in Bozeman, Montana, for seven years when the owners outsourced the management of the hotel in 2012. For Zabawa, the hotel's banquet manager, this meant that any parties that took place in the hotel would now be overseen by an outside firm, an Ohio-based company called Gateway Hospitality Group.
The banquet workers whom Zabawa oversaw weren't being let go, so the service-industry lifer says she took the change in stride -- that is, until Gateway explained the new policy on gratuities.
By tradition, when clients of the hotel ran up banquet tabs, they'd be subject to an automatic gratuity of 18 to 20 percent. That money was then distributed among the waiters, bartenders and other food workers who handled the event, according to Zabawa. For workers earning close to minimum wage, these tips could equal half their base pay, and they were essential to making a living.
But according to Zabawa and a lawsuit she's filed in Montana state court, after Gateway took over, the automatic gratuity was renamed a "service" or "setup" fee, and the house stopped distributing that money to staff. Zabawa claims that workers were told to sign papers accepting a new flat wage that didn't include gratuities. Most workers were given a nominal raise of about $1 per hour, but it didn't come close to making up for the lost tips, she says.
As banquet manager, Zabawa says she was tasked with implementing the new policy.
"It was awful," Zabawa, 50, told The Huffington Post. "Just imagine working there with those people for years. They were my family. It was horrible to go through, and I had no options."
Zabawa claims she was pressured to quit her job after telling management she believed the new policy violated Montana wage laws. She is suing over what she deems wrongful termination, and she's asked the court to declare the hotel's use of service fees illegal.
Hilton and the hotel's operator, Bozeman Lodging Investors, did not respond to requests for comment about Zabawa's allegations. Bob Voelker, Gateway's CEO and a Hilton veteran, told HuffPost he would not comment on ongoing litigation. According to the company's website, Gateway has contracts with at least 17 Hilton-brand properties in four states.
In the service industry, it's become fairly common for the house to present customers with a charge that's implied to be a tip for the workers -- only to turn around and keep that money for itself. Such add-on costs often come in the guise of a "service" fee, and the charge tends to match what most of us would associate with a typical gratuity.
For businesses, these fees often function as a surreptitious price increase, allowing them to charge customers more while maintaining the same base price. Though these fees don't go to workers, people like Zabawa believe their presence makes customers assume that the bartenders, servers and others who rely on tips have somehow been covered.
"I had employees who quit," Zabawa said. "They just weren't willing to work there anymore."
Zabawa's employees weren't the only workers feeling burned by such fees. In 2010, catering employees who worked the U.S. Open at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York sued the concessions company there for allegedly pocketing a 21 percent service fee that was tacked onto customers' bills. The workers, who also claimed they were shorted on overtime pay, argued that the service fee was portrayed as a gratuity. The class-action lawsuit was settled in 2013 for $600,000.
As HuffPost reported in 2011, beer and hot dog vendors at New York's Yankee Stadium claimed they were victims of a similar scheme. The stadium's concessionaire, Legends Hospitality, was attaching a 20 percent service fee to the drink and food orders in the stadium's luxury boxes, but the vendors who sold those orders were only taking in 4 to 6 percent in commission. According to a lawsuit filed by the vendors, the remainder of that 20 percent fee was going to Legends, which, at the time, was jointly owned by the New York Yankees, the Dallas Cowboys and the investment bank Goldman Sachs. (After it was sued, Legends made clear on its menus that only a small portion of the fee went to servers.)
The practice has even made its way into the pizza delivery business. As HuffPost reported last year, Pizza Hut, Papa John's and Domino's now commonly tack nominal "delivery fees" onto the tabs of delivery orders. Those fees, which are usually between $1.50 and $3 a pop, do not go to the drivers, even though many customers forego a driver tip believing that they do. Many career drivers told HuffPost they believe the practice has helped depress wages in their field.
HuffPost readers: Do you work in a job where "service fees" do not go to workers? Tell us about it.
One former catering worker at the U.S. Open said the use of service fees not only hurts workers' paychecks, but also creates confusion and tension among clients.
"In this industry, it happens a lot. A client will have the assumption that the service fee is indicative of some type of gratuity going to the employee," said the worker, who asked to remain anonymous due to the litigation. "They're feeling that they're already being forced to pay a tip. A strange sort of animosity can build up between the client and the server."
Several states have recognized the problems stemming from service fees and tried to address them in their own ways, with laws now on the books in Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New York and Washington state.
In Hawaii, any hotel or restaurant that tacks on a service fee is required to distribute that fee in full to employees. A similar statute in Massachusetts applies the same rule to the service industry at large, while also barring management from sharing in employee tip pools. In Washington state, service fees may be used, but receipts must show clearly how much of the fee goes to employees.
Recently, the hotel workers' union Unite Here has worked to insert language into local wage laws to ensure that service fees stay with workers. According to the minimum wage ordinance passed last year in Los Angeles, which established a $15 wage floor for large hotels in the city, any such fee belongs to the workforce, regardless of what management chooses to call it -- be it a "service charge," a "delivery charge" or a "porterage" fee, to name a few examples.
The Montana law, which would cover Zabawa's hotel, defines a service fee as "an arbitrary fixed charge added to the customer's bill by an employer in lieu of a tip." According to state code, such a fee "must be distributed directly to the nonmanagement employee preparing or serving the food or beverage or to any other employee involved in related services."
"Defendants admit they do not provide the 20% arbitrary fee to the nonmanagement staff members," Zabawa's lawyer, Jason Armstrong, wrote in a court filing, referring to Gateway and Bozeman Lodging Investors. "The question then becomes one of law; is the policy legal or not under the law?"
According to Zabawa, the hotel lost many of its servers under the new gratuity policy, since for them it effectively translated to a pay cut. Zabawa said she was simply instructed to hire new employees.
After workers lost their tips, one of the servers brought the language of the Montana statute to Zabawa, she claims in her lawsuit. Zabawa, in turn, took the server's concerns to a manager for Gateway. Zabawa alleges in her suit that she was then instructed to "write up" the "problem employee" and fire her. Zabawa says she refused.
Zabawa says she then lost her position as banquet manager and was switched to a sales job. In her lawsuit, she argues that leaving "was the only reasonable alternative" at that point. Under Montana law, such a voluntary termination could still be considered wrongful discharge if the employer created an intolerable situation.
After eight years at the hotel, Zabawa wound up working part-time at Pier 1 Imports before finding a new job in banquet work. Her income has taken a sharp drop, she says, but that's something she's managed to live with.
