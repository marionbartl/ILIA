A periscope rifle is a rifle that has been adapted to enable it to be sighted by the use of a periscope. This enables the shooter to remain concealed below cover. The device was independently invented by a number of individuals in response to the trench warfare conditions of the First World War, and while it is not clear which army was the first to use periscope rifles, the weapons were in use by the end of 1914.[1] Similar devices were also built for use with machine guns.[2][3]
Youlten hyposcope [ edit ]
The first periscope sighting rifle attachment was the Youlten hyposcope invented by W. Youlten. An early version of the attachment was tested in 1903, receiving its first patent in 1914. Its maximum range was 600 yards (550 m).[4][5][6]
Beech's periscope rifle [ edit ]
William Beech with their creation, May 1915.
A form of periscope rifle was invented in May 1915 during the Gallipoli campaign by an Australian soldier, Lance Corporal William Beech, a builder's supervisor in civilian life.[7] Beech was at time serving in the 2nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force (AIF). The device allowed a soldier to aim and fire a rifle from a trench, without being exposed to enemy fire.[8] Beech modified a standard Lee–Enfield .303 rifle by cutting the stock in half. The two halves were re-connected with a board and mirror periscope, horizontally aligned to the sights of the rifle, as well as a string to pull the trigger, which allowed the rifle to be fired from beneath the line of fire. According to the testimony of John Adams, a private who served with Beech, the idea came to Beech after the dramatic experience of seeing the bodies of fellow soldiers shot through the head.[7]
Beech's device was quickly copied by other members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). It saw extensive use in the intense trench warfare of Gallipoli,[9] where some lines of trenches – such as at Quinn's Post – were within 50 metres (160 ft) of one another. According to a Gallipoli campaign participant, Sir D.G. Ferguson, the use of conventional rifles during daytime was abandoned in favour of periscope rifles.[10] It was generally regarded as significantly less accurate than a conventional Lee–Enfield, although the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918 states it was accurate to 200–300 yards (180–270 m).[7] A test conducted on the TV documentary series The Boffin, the Builder and the Bombardier suggested that the effective range was approximately 100 yards (91 m).[11] However, during the Gallipoli campaign, a reduced effective range was not a significant problem as in many sectors, the Turkish and Allied trenches were close together. Some were only five yards apart.[12]
Periscope rifles were later manufactured in crude production lines on the beach at Anzac Cove. Field Marshal Sir William Birdwood described the invention as one of considerable importance during the Gallipoli campaign. In 1921, the British War Office awarded Beech ₤100 for the invention[7] (around £4,000 in 2015, when adjusted for inflation).
Other World War I rifles [ edit ]

Two Lee–Enfield periscope adaptations were patented in September 1915. The first by J.E. Chandler was able to fire a full magazine before being dismounted. The second by G. Gerard was of a similar design.[14] This was followed by E.C. Robert Marks's design in 1916,[15] and the patents of M.E. Reginald and S.J. Young in 1918.[16][17]
On the Western Front periscope rifles were used by the Belgian,[18] British[19] and French armies.[20] A periscope version of the Mosin–Nagant rifle was used by the Imperial Russian Army on the Eastern Front.[21]
A number of periscope rifles including the "Elder" and the "Cameron-Yaggi" were devised in the United States. The Cameron-Yaggi was invented in 1914, but development of the model came to an end after the Armistice in November 1918.[22] The Cameron-Yaggi included a mechanism to operate the rifle's bolt and the rifle's periscope also functioned as a 4-power telescopic sight.[23] The M1903 Springfield rifle could be fitted with an enlarged magazine with 25 rounds,[24] and both the Cameron-Yaggi[23] and the Elder rifle[13] made use of this, so as many shots as possible could be fired without needing to dismount the rifle below the trench parapet for reloading.
A Dutch version, known as the M.95 Loopgraafgeweer (Trench gun) was based on the Dutch Mannlicher service rifle. It saw service with the Royal Netherlands Army from 1916 until World War II.[25] Another example was the Guiberson periscope rifle stock.[26]

It was a situation I was used to. An event hall is an event hall after all, and photographers face the same obstacles in each one; tripping tablecloths, floral centre pieces, stray lawn chairs, loose wires, red and green lights. The tiered floor led down to the stage. On every table crumpled cigarettes lay in glass ashtrays gasping their last breaths.
Rebellious, isn't it, to smoke inside nowadays? Well, how apt. We were in the city of Baalbek. Nestled in Lebanon's North Bekaa Valley, this Iranian financed, Hezbollah controlled corner of the country is a launching pad for soldiers sympathetic to the Syrian regime. That very afternoon, before the show, the streets were clogged by a funeral procession for a returning local.
But the flow of people across the mountainous border is far greater from the other direction. Over a million Syrian and re-re-located Palestinians are in Lebanon seeking shelter from the war next-door. Some of these people were sitting on the lawn chairs around the round tables, crumpling cigarettes in to the glass ashtrays and moving the flower pieces in order to see each other better in the red and green lights.
A crowd had gathered in Baalbek's function hall to see the final show of a year's worth of film, theatre and music workshops facilitated by the NGO Better Together: Search for Common Ground. The program saw young Syrians and Lebanese come together to tell their stories of escaping war and accommodating those who have, respectively. As the name suggests, Better Together: Search for Common Ground seeks to iron out the tensions that inevitably arise when communities are involuntarily thrust upon one another.
Readers of Western media are, by now, accustomed to the images of those escaping terror; children peeking from behind tarpaulin doors, families being hauled onto dry land from rickety vessels, bodies on the sand. However, this event endowed the young participants with new creative skills and returned the power of representation back to those affected. This wasn't swampy Macedonian fields nor was it hysterical parents. This was black-tie, crisp shirts, special occasion head-scarves, heavy make-up, laughter.
One film, done in the style of an old silent movie, told the story of a Syrian girl and their father's struggle to earn money selling milk from their cow. The father became exhausted so the daughter started to sell milk herself, too. To avoid damaging their father's pride, they would do it secretly; getting up early to milk the cow, walking to the shop and returning before their father woke up. The secret was out when the father found their daughter collapsed outside. They were stricken with exhaustion, too. Escaping the war is often just the beginning of the struggle.
Official discourse in the West is preoccupied with refugees on the move and how we divert these humans humanely. We're less bothered about the sedentary people in the refugee camps within ear-shot of the Syrian border. They're safe, what more do they want? Refugees face the constant threat of fading into a statistic. For most Europeans, the humans who inhabit the camps that litter the Levant as well as the migrants trudging through the Balkan barriers are merely faceless blobs on a map.
I sat down next to Mahmoud, 21, who told me that in the dead of night in Baalbek, they can hear the dull thudding of shells on the other side of the mountain. Their besieged home town, Zabadani, where the majority of their family remain, is a mere 32km away from our conversation. They made the difficult decision to leave two years ago. They told me they taught themselves English by watching super-hero films, which became evident from the Hollywood twang in their voice as they reeled through a list of people they knew working at the NGO Action Aid. They wanted to see if I knew any of them. It's a small world for the Syrians in Lebanon. There are restrictions on who is allowed to drive, curfews, and most of the jobs on offer are badly paid, arduous and illegal—something that the recruiters of Jihad use to their advantage.
However, Mahmoud tells me that although it can be boring from time to time in Baalbek they at least has more to do than they did in Zabadani. They spend their days making films, taking photographs for Action Aid, playing music or otherwise “just doing as much as I can before I go to sleep”. They have aspirations to join their brother in Germany but, without the means, for now they are just trying to stay busy. For Mahmoud the show was an opportunity to break their routine and to forge friendships. How necessary companionship is.
But that night in Baalbek wasn't just an opportunity to celebrate conviviality; it was an excuse to party. Shoulder to shoulder, arms around shoulders and, at one point, a tower of three people on each other's shoulders. Mahmoud captured that for me on my camera as I no longer had free reign of my arms. The dancing was ferocious and the smiles were contagious. I stood still and took in the screams of joy, the greedy embraces and the dripping mascara. This was a shared history. A shared story. Perhaps the most important of our times. Step outside the hall and the empty streets filled with rain. Drive for half an hour East and the streets are stained with blood.
This night to forget reality, if for just a couple of hours, was a night to remember. People are people, after all. What we have in common is revealed in the way we deal with the obstacles put in front of us.

Gov. Greg Abbott is calling Lone Star State lawmakers back to work, but gun carry reform did not make their list of 20 action items to focus on.
While a few pro-gun bills passed the legislature earlier this year, two proposals in the Texas House that would have brought permitless carry to the state were left to stagnate, prompting gun rights groups to call on Abbott to convene a special session. The first-term Republican did pull legislators back in session late Tuesday but their marching orders covering everything from a pay increase for teachers to cracking down on mail-in ballot fraud left out any mention of constitutional carry.
“A special session was entirely avoidable, and there was plenty of time for the legislature to forge compromises to avoid the time and taxpayer expense of a special session,” said Abbott. “As Governor, if I am going to call a special session, I intend to make it count.”
State Rep. Jonathan Stickland, the author of HB 375, one of the bills left in committee, vowed Tuesday that they would be “filing constitutional carry on day 1 of the special session,” but is it unclear how much traction it will achieve without being on Abbott's agenda. Their measure, a repeat of a proposal filed in 2014, would allow all adults otherwise lawfully able to possess a handgun under federal and Texas laws to carry one without a permit or training.
Open Carry Texas, who along with Lone Star Gun Rights and others had backed a push to convene the session, noted the conspicuous absence of the carry measure from the session's marching orders from Abbott.
Derek Wills, with Lone Star Gun Rights, told Guns.com if Abbott was as pro-gun as they say they are, permitless carry legislation would have been in their agenda.
“Maybe Gov. Abbott is not nearly the Second Amendment champion that they claim to be. They took pride in signing SB16, claiming it to be a huge victory for gun rights, but when given the chance to include constitutional carry in their proclamation for a special session, they didn't.”
The session will begin on July 18. If Stickland and their supporters cannot move the needle on constitutional carry, the subject will be moot until the 86th Texas legislature convenes in 2019.

The protests against Mohammad Morsi's government in Cairo are the largest ever in the country's history — even bigger than the massive protests two years ago that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Millions of people took to the streets on Sunday, which was really something, and the protests continued on Monday. The Egyptian military gave the Morsi government 48 hours to respond to the people — but insisted its policy opposes cops. The protests are even more spectacular at night. In the GIF at right, taken from Al Jazeera's coverage of the protests, you can see how big it is. You can also see the green pen lasers, which were pointed at the windows of Muslim Brotherhood offices before they were ransacked. Protesters chanted "Leave!" Here are some photos of the enormous crowds — and from the people inside them. Remarkably, many people are smiling.
Nouraradwan says, "33 million people standing there all day all night waiting for morsi to step down ...unbelieve Guys good job god blesses you all..never saw them smiling Till now i can see the happiness in their eyes."
Another view of the massive crowd:

Funny, incisive satire? Offensive schtick that plays on ignorant, hurtful stereotypes? Don't let anyone tell you those are mutually exclusive categories. The Colbert Report's writers, the many audience members who laughed at the bit, and the two Korean-American journalists who wrote up the ensuing controversy at Deadspin are among those who expressed appreciation for the segment.
Many found it to be an adept takedown of a deserving target.
Writer Jay Caspian Kang, who is a pleasure to read on every subject, adeptly explained why some Asian Americans might take offense at the joke, even if they fully understood its context and intent. "There's a long tradition in American comedy of dumping tasteless jokes at the feet of Asians and Asian-Americans that follows the perception that we will silently weather the ridicule," they observed. "If I were to predict which minority group the writers of a show like 'The Colbert Report' would choose for an edgy, epithet-laden parody, I'd grimace and prepare myself for some joke about rice, karate, or broken English. The resulting discomfort has nothing to do with the intentions of the joke or the political views of the people laughing at it. Even when you want to be in on the joke—and you understand, intellectually, that you are not the one being ridiculed—it's hard not to wonder why these jokes always come at the expense of those least likely to protest."
That's a fair critique of the segment. Were I a TV comedian, I probably wouldn't have broadcast it, because I don't find the joke particularly funny, original, or insightful, while I find the hurt that it caused understandable and totally predictable.
But neither do I condemn Colbert. Specific criticism of one segment is as far as I want to go, because at their best, they are a brilliant satirist, which is to say that they thoughtfully probe ideologies and social taboos, and challenges us to think through our sensibilities. Doing that work on a nightly basis inevitably results in misses as well as hits. A satirist who never upsets anyone in the audience, who never goes too far, is inevitably falling short of their or their potential, as surely as an investor who never loses money or a quarterback who never throws an interception. Better that comedy occasionally offends than that it never challenges, so long as it isn't coming from a place of incitement, hate or racialist supremacy.

Suey Park is a 23-year-old activist. On Twitter, they are best known as the creator of the hashtag #notyourAsiansidekick. The Wall Street Journal's Jeff Yang describes it as a "collection of angry voices sharing their frustrations with the lack of representation and respect given to Asian Americans in mainstream society and mainline feminism." The hashtag "spiraled its way onto the radar screens of shocked non-Asian editors and reporters, who never saw this upwelling of rage and resistance coming from a community they'd perceived as quiescent." At its best, the hashtag offered a useful frame for advancing a pent-up critique. Helping so many to express themselves is an impressive accomplishment.
Minister for Finance Michael Noonan has defended their participation in a welcoming party for billionaire business person Donald Trump at Shannon airport earlier this week.
A harpist, singer and violinist joined local dignitaries to greet Mr Trump on a red carpet before they visited the Doonbeg golf resort in Co Clare which they have purchased for €15 million.
The event on Monday was criticised by some commentators including The Irish Times' Malachy Clerkin, who accused the welcoming party of “bowing and scraping” to Mr Trump.
Mr Noonan, who is a TD for Limerick, dismissed such criticism this afternoon.
“Would there be criticism if it was an IDA factory that was going into West Clare with 300 jobs? This man says he's going to spend at least double the purchase price for investment down there.”
Mr Noonan said Mr Trump had also announced “commuter helicopters” from Shannon to the Doonbeg golf course and to other golf courses they owned in the UK.
“I've no connection with Donald Trump but I can assure you if it was the IDA that was bringing a factory into Clare and I was invited to go down there and there were 300 jobs in it, I'd be there,” they said during an interview on RTÉ Radio One's News at One programme.
They said Mr Trump had consolidated a golf course that was in difficulty and already had a lot of people working for them in the area.

​Kevin Heldman is an award-winning journalist. He's reported from such places as a psychiatric hospital, a Japanese prison, a London homeless shelter, Albania and Afghanistan. East New York is, by far, the worst neighborhood in New York City, among the worst in the nation, and has been for quite some time. Kevin tried to report out why.
Then something happened.
This is What The Hell Happened In East New York?, a co-production with The Big Roundtable that seeks to answer that question in two parts. The first is a four-episode podcast that chronicles Kevin as they unravel the issues with East New York, and ultimately, himself. The second, available on Friday, is Kevin's exhaustive investigation into why East New York is the way it is.
'What The Hell Happened In East New York?'
Running time: 15:35
For 25 years one neighborhood has remained New York's most crime ridden, most polluted, most neglected, most hopeless — cut off from Brooklyn's emergence as the hippest place on earth. Award-winning journalist Kevin Heldman wants to know why.
'I can't just do fun stuff in Journalism'
RUNNING TIME: 16:24
Kevin Heldman grew up next to East New York. Their journey since has been anything but easy — a troubled youth, an army stint, a flourishing journalism career all but abandoned in the wake of a tragic death. Then they rediscovered their calling, not far from where they once played in the city dump.
'It's not a ghetto. It needs a new term'
RUNNING TIME: 18:26
The mystery of how so much danger and despair can afflict one neighborhood gives way to Kevin's growing anger, as they walk the streets and pours through statistics trying to make sense of the place that obsesses him.
'It's a prison'

Civic leaders want to fix East New York? Do they know what they're up against?
If we are to make any progress in tackling the obesity crisis, we have to look again at what really makes us fat, claims an article published in this week'sGary Taubes, co-founder of the Nutrition Science Initiative , argues that our understanding of the cause of obesity may be incorrect, and that rectifying this misconception is "absolutely critical" to future progress."What we want to know," they say, "is what causes us to gain weight, not whether weight loss can be induced under different conditions of semi-starvation."The history of obesity research is a history of two competing hypotheses of energy balance and endocrinology , writes Taubes. Since the 1950s, conventional wisdom on obesity has been that it is caused by a positive energy balance - in other words we get fat because we overeat. The alternative hypothesis - that obesity is a hormonal or regulatory disorder - was dismissed after the second world war as being unworthy of serious attention.But Taubes believes that the wrong hypothesis - energy balance - won out and that it is this hypothesis, along with substandard science, that has fuelled the obesity crisis and the related chronic diseases.He argues that attempts to blame the obesity epidemics worldwide on increased availability of calories "typically ignore the fact that these increases are largely carbohydrates " and, as such, these observations "shed no light on whether it's total calories to blame or the carbohydrate calories."Nor do they shed light on the more fundamental question of whether people or populations get fat "because they're eating more, or eat more because the macronutrient composition of their diets is promoting fat accumulation ... in effect, driving an increase in appetite."Taubes also points to "substandard" research that is "incapable of answering the question of what causes obesity."As a result, they have co-founded the Nutrition Science Initiative, a not-for-profit organisation to "fund and facilitate rigorously well controlled experimental trials, carried out by independent, sceptical researchers." Our hope, they say, is that these experiments will answer definitively the question of what causes obesity, and help us finally make meaningful progress against it.If we are to make progress in the struggle against obesity and its related chronic diseases, they believe we must accept the existence of alternative hypotheses of obesity, refuse to accept substandard science, and find the willingness and the resources to do better."With the burden of obesity now estimated at greater than $150bn (£100bn; €118bn) a year in the US alone, virtually any amount of money spent on getting nutrition research right can be defended on the basis that the long term savings to the healthcare system and to the health of individuals will offset the costs of the research by orders of magnitude," they conclude.

The Persian Cats Take Down Another Drone
A year ago Iran managed to take down a U.S. stealthy RQ-170 drone that violated its airspace without much damage.

Today Iran took down another, smaller U.S. drone. A Boeing Scan Eagle which might have been launched from a ship in the Persian Gulf. The video, below the fold, shows that the Iranians caught this one, like the other one, without any obvious damage. All that cat training was obviously quite successful.
While some believe that GPS spoofing, overriding the original GPS signal with a deceiving one, is the way Iran could have done this, I doubt that and I still find my old explanation the more plausible one:
When the drone is in the air it is controlled via a satellite link from a remote operating station. But during start and landing the drone is piloted via line-of-sight radio by an operator near the start or landing field. This is necessary because the remote satellite link has a delay of several hundred milliseconds which is just too much latency to correct wind sheer and other problems during takeoff and landing. What the Iranians seem to have done is to take over the drone's line-of-sight control. This after electronically disrupting its satellite link. Disrupting the satellite link alone would not be enough as the drone would then have followed some preprogrammed action like simply flying back to where it came from. With the line-of-sight control active a satellite link disruption would not lead to a preprogrammed abort. We can reasonably assume that the Iranians have some station near Kandahar Airport that is listening to all military radio traffic there. They had four years to analyze the radio signaling between the ground operator and such drones. Even if that control signal is encrypted pattern recognition during many flights over four years would have given them enough information to break the code.
The U.S. (and Israel) are routinely violating other countries airspace. This might one day come back to haunt them. The technological development of drones is no longer a hurdle and soon other countries will also have many of them. Hizbullah flying a drone above Israels Dimona reactor is just a sign of things to come.
We also must again emphasize that despite five years of continued illegal drone espionage over Iran the U.S. has found not one bit of evidence of any existence of an Iranian nuclear weapons program.
One wonders if future officials will resent their forerunner's dumb idea of creating a customary law of air violations for the senseless quest for proof of an Iranian program that does not exist.
Press TV has now put up a longer, more detailed video.

Jeremy Thrush has played all their club rugby in their native New Zealand
New Zealand lock Jeremy Thrush has agreed to join Gloucester from Hurricanes for next season.
Capped 11 times by the All Blacks, the 29-year-old will arrive at Kingsholm after this summer's Rugby World Cup.
The Auckland-born second row has played 95 times for Hurricanes in Super Rugby, scoring nine tries.
"Signing a player of Jeremy's ability further highlights Gloucester's ambition to compete with the best clubs in Europe," said boss David Humphreys.
"He has been a stand-out performer in Super XV rugby over a number of seasons, and the experience they have gained being part of a successful All Blacks squad will be a key element in establishing Gloucester as one of the dominant forward packs in England."
Thrush made their international debut in June 2013, coming off the bench against France in Auckland, and went on to earn five Test caps in their debut year.
They added a further six caps in 2014, and was part of their recent UK tour squad.
Forget Chelsea & Man City, Liverpool's 'Beautiful Arrogance' Will Win Them The Title
“Beautiful Arrogance.”
A phrase that Brendan Rodgers used mid-week to describe the moment at Old Trafford when a rampant Liverpool team created a move which involved 56 passes. A wonderful phrase that quickly became an ethos, an aspiration, a raison d'être for a side currently conducting the maddest, most unexpected title charge of all time.
Beautiful Arrogance is Luis Suarez toying with Cardiff's (frankly excellent) goalkeeper - Will I shoot? Will I take it round you? Will I square it to Raheem? What will I do? - before curving a delicate shot for their third and Liverpool's sixth.
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
Beautiful Arrogance is the unremarked ‘hold, hold, now give' that Jordan Henderson effected to allow Glenn Johnson space on the wing, Beautiful Arrogance is the sumptuous back heel by Daniel Sturridge that placed the ball into the path of the onrushing Suarez for their second.
Beautiful Arrogance is the fact that we no longer remark when Martin Skrtel is on a hat trick.
Beautiful Arrogance is the fact that I can turn to the guy that I'm watching the game with and say “Isn't it ridiculous that we can score five goals away from home and we don't comment on it anymore because this is just what we do dow?”

This is just what we do now.
And the truth is that we were awful for the first half hour of the game. The diamond formation didn't work against a Cardiff side which set up with three centre backs - obviously taking on board Gerrard's advice: “Any side that wants to go two on two with those two (Suarez and Sturridge)? All the best”
Space was allowed, balls were lost too easily, passing was short or off target. Joe Allen, so excellent against United, was terrible. We deserved to be behind twice. We also deserved to equalise twice because we have abandoned the concept of losing. We no longer understand the idea of defeat, we no longer believe that that can happen to us.
Beautiful Arrogance.
There is sympathy for Cardiff for the circumstances of the third. Brilliantly Suarez had managed to injure two Cardiff players with the same free kick - because that's the kind of thing that happens to us nowadays - and the FA have this pathetic, ridiculous rule (one of many obviously) that once a player has received treatment on the pitch they have to leave the field of play before being allowed to return. Cardiff faced a corner - which, let's not forget, we are now utterly lethal at - with nine men.
There was sympathy. Not whilst Skrtel was scoring their second obviously. Then there was only relief and belief that victory would follow. But after. After there was sympathy.
More Beautiful Arrogance in the fact that Suarez, having broken free from their marker, set up an onrushing Daniel Sturridge with a nutmegged cross. Because this is what we do now.
The second half was ours because what we do now is come back from adversity (and yes we allowed Cardiff an easy third but we had five to our name by that point, it no longer mattered) and exert control, exert authority, exert - you know it's coming - Beautiful Arrogance.
Six successive league wins now. Only eight more to go.
I have made bullish claims this season. Ridiculous claims. One by one those claims have been ridiculed and one by one they have been shown to be realistic. I said that we would finish in the top four and that Manchester United would be lucky to reach the top six. I was ridiculed. I upped my claim to finishing third. Ridiculed. I said second. Again.
I tell you this: If we win our eight remaining games we will have won the league.
Beautiful Arrogance.

THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT! Please visit www.swivit.us for more information and to keep up to date.
Life's greatest moments happen all around us—not just in front of the camera!
We love that GoPro cameras capture everything everywhere, but the current mounts and accessories have a huge limitation: the camera is locked in a single direction. Until now, it's been challenging and inconvenient to change the camera direction, which involved fumbling with mounts, bolts, linkages, and adjustments.
Well you don't need to do that anymore.
The SWIVIT PRO gives you the freedom to quickly and easily capture multiple angles—and more of what's going on around you—right in the moment.
So... No matter what, how, or where you film...
The SWIVIT PRO can also:
Turn the camera to face backward while not recording, which can help protect lens from debris damage when traveling at higher speeds.
Help capture 360° of video while mounted on a tripod or other mounts, giving you better stability and continuity than with handheld filming.
Assist with more than just action sports: it's indispensable at events or during stage and film production.
Work with numerous camera and rigging setups to collect B-roll; get simultaneous, multi-angle footage without affecting the main shot, or use it for the main shot, too.
Play nice with numerous GoPro and 3rd-party mounts, including many of the ones that have been successfully funded here on Kickstarter!
Guarantee offline, analog simplicity:
No connections required. No OS dependencies. No worries...
And the biggest perk of them all: VERSATILITY!
From surfing to snowmobiling to racing a taxi driver in Mexico, the uses are endless...
Several years ago, while out riding motorcycles with a few friends on some twisty NorCal roads, I realized I needed a SWIVIT PRO. (It just took a little while to figure out what that looked like.)
That day, I was the only one with a camera and I wanted to be able to film my friends riding in front of me, plus when they were behind or next to me. However, every time I wanted to get those other angles of footage, it meant pulling over, parking the bike, taking off my gloves, flipping the camera, and checking the alignment, then getting back on the road. When I'm alone, this is an inconvenience, but in a group, it's almost not worth the trouble.
So, I did what we've all had to do for years: resigned myself to putting in the additional time and effort to change the direction my camera was pointing.
In Fall 2012, I found myself roadtripping through Mexico in a car, running into the same old challenges. Although my GoPro was conveniently mounted within arm's reach near the driver-door mirror (which let me turn the camera off and on whenever I wanted), the camera was still stuck in a single direction. Once again, I was missing the opportunity to capture so much more on my travels, and alone on the side of the road fiddling with mounts and cameras.
It was pretty much at that moment, I knew the SWIVIT PRO needed to come to life and I was going to be the guy to create it.
Inspiration and concepts.
When I sat down to design and develop my first prototype, I realized that this mount wasn't just for motorcyclists (or people in cars doing their best Jeremy Clarkson impersonation). Done right, the SWIVIT PRO could be one of the simplest and most functional tools for all GoPro users.
With this goal in mind, I decided to take the leap of faith. I was going to quit my job, found SWIVIT, and start working on making this whole thing a reality.
Now that I've nearly reached that goal, I hope you'll all believe in—and benefit from—the SWIVIT PRO as much as I do. Thanks!
I decided to start with 3D printing, and to make the process quick and easy, the initial prototype was minimalistic, at best.
It served as a great proof of concept, but had all the charm of an ugly little hockey puck. Clearly, the design had to improve dramatically...
First 3D-printed prototype for proof of concept.
I wouldn't be able to 3D-print the prototype anymore, as it had to be strong enough to handle whatever testing we could throw at it. Injection-molding was out, too, since that wasn't going to be cost-effective for a couple of one-off prototypes.
With this in mind, it made sense to mill the next prototypes from aluminum . Along with the strength needed for testing, this kept it affordable.
Machining Prototype 2 for real-world testing.
The second prototype improved the look and feel (I wanted to design something out of the norm) but, due to the redesign, limited the vertical range of motion of the camera. After a couple of uses, I got back to sketching, and made another round of corrections and adjustments for the third prototype.
Perfectly balancing the simplicity of design and function, this third and final prototype is what I hope to produce and deliver to backers.
Third prototype's CNC work and post-anodizing.
The prototype being tested today is also milled aluminum, but was polished to a shine and anodized black to show you what I intend the final product to look like.
If this project's funding goals are met, the SWIVIT PRO will be injection-molded from the same quality, high-strength polycarbonate plastics that are used to create many other mounts and accessories available today.
The SWIVIT PRO will NOT be made from aluminum.
Also, you will notice that the small acorn nut holder is missing on a prototype. This was done on purpose to make the CNC process happen.
The current design proved challenging enough to mill out, and the addition of that would have added many more hours worth of work, at the expense of possibly breaking not only the prototype, but possibly the CNC machine or drill bits as well. Rest assured, that little bolt holder will be in the final version as seen below...
2 design ideas for the acorn nut holder. Standard and stylized.
Of course, if this project doesn't meet the funding goals, then you don't pay a penny.
(That also means no product or rewards, and that's a bit of a bummer, so let's do this!)
This campaign can make the SWIVIT PRO a reality, and I don't plan on stopping there.
We all agree that any product/company should think about evolution and growth, and with your help—and, most importantly, your input/feedback—I hope this is just the beginning.
I took a chance to get this far, but I can't do it alone. With a little bit of support, we can grow into a skilled team that continues to deliver simple, affordable, and versatile products and accessories for all of us
We all strive to meet deadlines. Of course, sometimes things happen, so please understand that these are approximate dates.
I'm just as excited about the SWIVIT PRO as you are, so if it's possible to deliver ahead of schedule on ANY of these approximate dates, I will! You have my word...
The infographic below is a top level view of each reward you could select as a backer. Please refer to the sidebar along the right side for more details before you select one. Also, remember that you are free to donate whatever amount you like. You are not required to only donate the amount that is set for each reward. If you are not interested in a mount, or any of the other rewards but would still like to help the cause, just select the $1 backer level, and hand type the amount that you would like to donate. For any other questions, please see the side bar for details, or the FAQs. THANK YOU!
For those interested in more than one SWIVIT PRO please refer to the chart below to see exactly what your pledge amount should be for the backer level you are in...
If you have further questions, please check out Update #1 for details.
After several requests, I figured there was no reason not to announce THE POSSIBILITY of having the SWIVIT PRO done in different colors. While most mounts and accessories are typically black, I think it would be cool to have a product that matches your personality. Maybe you want to be color coordinated while out there capturing life's greatest moments. Ride a Ducati? Perhaps you'd like a red or white mount. Kawasaki? Green it is. Like the SF Giants? Orange or black would work for you then. Dodgers (I'm sorry) Blue for you. Surfing? Blue or perhaps a Green Flash? Maybe you want to match your racing team colors? Maybe you just think black is boring. Whatever the case, you want to be different. And I'm here to help.
Remember... Possible colors. Not a pledge option yet.
So here's how this will work. If you are a backer for $20 or above, you will be able to vote on what the next color will be. This will be based solely on backer votes, so if green is the winner and you don't like green, you'll just have to stick with black. However, if the funding goal is met and I can work out a cost effective way to do it, then I will move on to the 2nd most popular color, then 3rd, and so on. I would love to see lots of little SWIVITSKITTLES out in the wild but we've got a little ways to go still.
I will be putting together the color survey soon, so don't miss your chance to get in on the voting!
Lastly, I would like to raise a glass and toast my friends and family (and even some strangers) who have encouraged me, pushed me, answered questions, given feedback, and most importantly, put up with my rambling on about ideas and frustrations over the past year. It's been a whirlwind and I appreciate you all more than words can express.

White House science adviser John Holdren's comment Monday that it was “unrealistic” to halt fossil fuel extraction altogether in the U.S. may have seemed like stating the obvious. But it has further highlighted the tensions that exist even among top American policymakers and environmental advocates concerned about curbing the rate of climate change.
Bernie Sanders and their followers, influential green movement leaders like Bill McKibben and powerful organizations like the Sierra Club, have been pushing a “keep it in the ground” approach. For these advocates, a future strongly dependent on wind, solar and batteries can't come fast enough. And they have led campaigns not only to oppose fracking for natural gas but also to block — successfully — the Keystone XL pipeline. Most recently, Sanders's supporters have been deeply engaged in a push to make the Democratic Party's official platform more strongly reflective of this point of view, although they were unsuccessful in trying to incorporate a fracking ban into the platform.
Yet Obama administration officials and many energy policy wonks continue to suggest that we will need to rely on burning natural gas, nuclear energy and even outfitting coal plants with carbon capturing technologies for some time. In contrast to “keep it in the ground,” their approach has sometimes been labeled “all of the above.” Meanwhile, Clinton has called natural gas, in particular, a “bridge” to a cleaner energy future.
Sanders's supporters did score a few victories in the recent platform-writing process by passing amendments endorsing a price on carbon, methane and other greenhouse gases and supporting the rights of local communities to ban fracking. Those “unity amendments” were implicitly backed by presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The tension was reawakened yesterday at this week's annual conference held by the Energy Information Administration. According to a Tweet by Brian Scheid, a reporter for Platts, Holdren yesterday called the “keep it in the ground” movement “unrealistic” in their keynote speech at the conference.
John Holdren, director of White House Office of Science and Tech Policy, calls “keep it in the ground” movement “unrealistic” #EIAConf — Brian Scheid (@BrianJScheid) July 11, 2016
Morning Consult also reported that Holdren stated, “The notion that we're going to keep it all in the ground is unrealistic. We are still a very heavily fossil-fuel dependent world.”
“When asked whether it was feasible to leave all the remaining fossil fuels in the ground, Dr. Holdren noted that it is not, because the U.S. — and the world — still depend on fossil fuels for more than 80 percent of all the primary energy we use,” said White House spokesperson Lindsey Geisler said in an email. “It's not practical or affordable to replace the huge, fossil-fuel infrastructure with nuclear and renewables overnight, no matter how badly we may want to. As a result, the U.S. will be using fossil fuels for decades to come, albeit, one hopes, with the share of non-fossil supplies increasing over time.”
In one sense, Holdren's remarks could be viewed as simply stating what's already known. Indeed, wind and solar provided a little over 5 percent of U.S. electricity last year. Meanwhile, a key driver of the recent U.S. trend toward “cleaner” energy has not been burning less fossil fuels, but rather the swapping of one fossil fuel for another.
More specifically, very cheap natural gas prices, which have driven fracking and the exploitation of huge new “unconventional” shale gas reserves, has led to a shift in how we get power. More and more, utility companies are switching away from burning coal for electricity and toward burning gas. According to the EIA, 2016 is likely to be the first year in which the country as a whole gets more of its electricity from gas than from coal.
And that has significant greenhouse gas emissions implications, as natural gas burns cleaner than coal and only produces about half as much carbon dioxide emissions per unit of energy.
“Facts are facts: America is leading the world in oil and natural gas production and in lowering carbon emissions, which are at 20-year lows, because of clean-burning natural gas,” said Eric Wohlschlegel, director of media relations and communications at the American Petroleum Institute, regarding the Holdren statement. “American voters support increased oil and natural gas production. They understand that the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine and that an all of the above energy strategy is needed to power our future. Keep-it-in-the-ground tactics aimed at misleading the public present a false choice, especially when there's overwhelming support for American energy production.”
In the transportation sector, meanwhile, cleaner options like electric cars or cars that run on high volumes of biofuels are even further away from achieving market dominance than wind and solar are in the electricity sector. So when Holdren reportedly called the “keep it in the ground” movement “unrealistic,” it was simply a statement that there is no way we are going to get off fossil fuels in the near term.
Still, that stance diverges from that of environmentalist allies. “Science shows clearly that if we want to protect the health of our communities from dangerous pollution and the serious threats of the climate crisis, we have to start keeping dirty fossil fuels in the ground now,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club, in response to Holdren's statement. “That clearly means that gas cannot be a bridge fuel, and the Obama Administration's efforts to mitigate the threat gas posed through methane safeguards and fracking standards shows they recognize the dangers of this pollutant.”
Indeed, top administration officials have emphasized the need to reexamine the climate implications of fossil fuel extraction from federal lands and waters, but have not yet embraced the idea of banning these activities altogether. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, a former petroleum engineer, has said that government officials need to recognize that some of the nation's fossil fuels must remain untapped if they are serious about combating global warming, and the department just imposed stricter rules on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean.
[Obama administration halts all new coal leases on federal land]
In January Interior put a moratorium on new coal leasing on federal land, arguing it needed to scrutinize both the carbon impact and economic implications of its coal leasing practices in the West.
But several aspects of the department's energy leasing program have continued under stricter safety standards, including offshore oil and gas leasing in the Gulf of Mexico. Those activities are a major source of revenue for the federal government.
Book by Richard Dawkins
The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True is a 2011 book by the British biologist Richard Dawkins, with illustrations by Dave McKean. The book was released on 15 September 2011 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 October 2011 in the United States.[1][2][3]
It is a graphic science book aimed primarily at children and young adults.[4][5] Dawkins has stated that the book is intended for those aged around 12 years and upwards, and that when trialling the book prior to publishing, younger readers were able to understand its content with additional adult assistance.[6]
The book is published in the United Kingdom by Bantam Press, and in the United States by Free Press.
Title [ edit ]
In the first chapter of the book, Richard Dawkins explains what they mean with the title The Magic of Reality:[7]
Magic is a slippery word: it is commonly used in three different ways, and the first thing I must do is distinguish between them. I'll call the first one 'supernatural magic', the second one 'stage magic' and the third one (which is my favourite meaning, and the one I intend in my title) 'poetic magic'. [...] What I hope to show you in this book is that reality – the facts of the real world as understood through the methods of science – is magical in this third sense, the poetic sense, the good to be alive sense. [...] In the rest of this book I want to show you that the real world, as understood scientifically, has magic of its own – the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works. Next to the true beauty and magic of the real world, supernatural spells and stage tricks seem cheap and tawdry by comparison. The magic of reality is neither supernatural nor a trick, but – quite simply – wonderful. Wonderful, and real. Wonderful because real.
Synopsis [ edit ]
Most chapters begin with brief re-tellings of creation myths that emerged as attempts to explain the origin of particular observed phenomena. Dawkins selects these myths from throughout the world, including Babylonian, Judeo-Christian, Aztec, Maori, Ancient Egyptian, Australian Aboriginal, Nordic, Hellenic, Chinese, Japanese, and other traditions. Chapter 9 ("Are we alone?") includes contemporary alien-abduction mythology; Chapter 4 ("What are things made of?") omits mythology altogether as Dawkins says that really small phenomena were unknown to primitive peoples prior to the invention of advanced optical magnification equipment, any texts they believed to be divinely inspired having failed to mention such useful knowledge as beyond human experience at the time. Dawkins also revisits their childhood and recalls their initial thoughts on these various phenomena or those thoughts expressed by their young contemporaries. Dawkins gives their critique of many of the myths, such as when they point out that much mythology involves some god's symbolic transgressive act performed just once, with Dawkins saying that such one-time acts would be inadequate to explain the mechanism as to why the phenomena continue to happen in unbroken cycles.
In the opening chapter Dawkins explains that although mythic narratives and make-believe are fun parts of growing up, reality — with its fundamental capacity for beauty — is much more magical than anything impossible. The Fairy Godmother from Cinderella cannot magically turn a pumpkin into a carriage outside the bounds of fiction, because pumpkins and carriages possess internal organisation that is fundamentally complex. A large pumpkin randomly reassembled at the most minute level would be much more likely to result in a featureless pile of ash or sludge than in a complex and intricately organised carriage.
In the subsequent chapters Dawkins addresses topics that range from evolutionary biology and speciation to physical phenomena such as atomic theory, optics, planetary motion, gravitation, stellar evolution, spectroscopy, and plate tectonics, as well as speculation on exobiology. Dawkins characterises their understanding of quantum mechanics as foggy[8] and so declines to delve very far into that topic. Dawkins declares that there was no first person, to make the point that evolutionary biologists use the term species to demark differences in gene composition — over often thousands of generations of separation — rather than from any one generation to the next. To illustrate this they undertake a thought-experiment involving family photographs. If, hypothetically, there existed a complete set of photographs of all one's direct male ancestors arranged in order of birth date (or hatch date) from youngest to oldest stretching back millions of generations, from one generation to the next one would not perceive much difference between any two adjacent pictures—looking at a picture of one's grandfather or great-grandfather one is looking at a picture of a human—but if one looked at a picture from 185 million generations back one would see an image of some kind of fish-like animal. Dawkins stresses this point by saying the offspring of any sexually reproducing life form belongs in almost all cases to the same species as do its parents, with the exception of unviable hybrids such as mules.
The last two chapters discuss chaos and the human psychology behind so-called miracle claims such as the examples of Our Lady of Fátima and the Cottingley Fairies. Dawkins presents philosopher David Hume's argument that miracle claims should only be seriously accepted if it would be a bigger miracle that the claimant was either lying or mistaken. Dawkins regards miracle claims written down in texts subsequently deemed sacred as not exempt from this standard.
Reception [ edit ]
Tim Radford, in their Guardian review, calls the presentation of the physical book "prodigiously illustrated and beautifully designed", and regarding the content says "it is a distillation of so much that Dawkins has written and argued since the publication of The Selfish Gene ... The strength is that they know their ground. The weakness is that – for a 'family audience' – they deliberately constrain their vocabulary along with the exuberant imagery and belligerence that made their reputation from the start."[9]
The New Scientist article collates the reviews of Andy Coghlan and those of their 20-year-old daughter Phoebe and their 13-year-old son Callum. Coghlan calls the book "a triumph" but wishes Dawkins had a chapter entitled "Why do people do bad things to others?" saying "The book provides a golden opportunity for Dawkins to ask whether we can evolve to treat one another more civilly. Alas, they don't seize it." Coghlan also supports Dawkins "encouraging readers to be bowled over by the stunning beauty of reality – a sentiment I thoroughly support. Too few of us wake up each day and reflect on how amazing it is that we are not only alive, but aware of being alive." Phoebe liked the book, they write "I was unable to put the book down. I found myself enjoying learning exciting new facts and having old ones reinforced. It was definitely no repeat of the classroom scenario... Perhaps the book's greatest asset is that it manages to bring science to life. The vibrant illustrations reinforce this, as do the fun font styles... Their style is colloquial, creating a relaxed, lighter tone." Callum, who is closest to the intended age for the book, doesn't need to be persuaded about the bounds of reality, they write: "Miracles don't exist. Simple as that. The Magic of Reality hasn't changed my views on anything."[10]
Neville Hawcock for the Financial Times praises Dawkins' clarity in explanation: "He really is very good at this. The chapter on rainbows has the clearest explanation of how they appear that I've ever seen." Of the myths Dawkins uses Hawcock writes: "These, straw gods set up for Dawkins to knock down, are not up to the job of accounting for reality but at least give McKean some great subject matter."[11] Meghan Cox Gurdon writing for the Wall Street Journal says: "His tone throughout alternates between real delight over how things work and avuncular pity for the people who persist in seeing an author behind the machinery of the universe... There is no plan, winks Mr. Dawkins, nor any divinity. There is just the 'magic' of the universe unfolding. If that is the view you wish your children to have of the cosmos, then The Magic of Reality will suit you very well."[12]
Wyndgate Country Club controversy [ edit ]
During Richard Dawkins' October 2011 book tour, its sponsor Center for Inquiry signed a contract with Wyndgate Country Club in Rochester Hills, Michigan, as the venue site. After seeing an interview with Dawkins on The O'Reilly Factor, an official at the club cancelled Dawkins' appearance. Dawkins said that the country club official accepted Bill O'Reilly's "twisted" interpretation of the book without having read it personally.[13][14] Sean Faircloth said that cancelling the reading "really violates the basic principles of America ... The Civil Rights Act ... prohibits discrimination based on race or religious viewpoint. ... [Dawkins has] published numerous books ... to explain science to the public, so it's rather an affront, to reason in general, to shun them as they did."[15] The Center for Inquiry Michigan executive director, Jeff Seaver, stated that "This action by The Wyndgate illustrates the kind of bias and bigotry that nonbelievers encounter all the time."[16] Following the cancellation, protests and legal action by the Center for Inquiry against the Wyndgate Country Club were pursued.[17] In 2013 this case was settled in favour of the Center For Inquiry.[18]

Kevin O'Leary may be running for Canada's Conservative Party leadership, but their heart and soul live in Boston. Indeed, O'Leary's a Bostonian to the core — and despite wanting to be Canada's next prime minister they have zero plans to move back to Canada any time soon.
Kevin O'Leary, a star of the U.S. TV show "Shark Tank" attends the Disney ABC Winter TCA Tour in Pasadena, Calif., in 2013. "Can an ego-driven Boston resident with seemingly no true commitment to the Conservative Party — or for Canada for that matter — really be the best hope for the Tories?" writes Bob Hepburn. ( Richard Shotwell / Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP )
He's lived in downtown Boston for more than 20 years, most of their work is based there, their favourite restaurant is just five blocks from their home, their favourite business meeting spot is nearby and they love watching their favourite Boston sports team on TV regardless of where they are in the world. “Boston is a really special place for me” O'Leary told Boston Magazine last October. “There's no town like Boston.” Although they maintain a home in Toronto and a cottage in Muskoka, O'Leary won't commit to moving to Canada full-time if they win the leadership, won't promise to run as a Conservative in the 2019 election if they lose the leadership contest, and won't commit to no longer appear as a panelist on U.S. television program Shark Tank if chosen as Tory leader.

Can an ego-driven Boston resident with seemingly no true commitment to the Conservative Party — or for Canada for that matter — really be the best hope for the Tories, who are in the midst of a 14-person leadership race? A look at their life in Boston shows why O'Leary still calls the city home. O'Leary and their wife first moved to the city in the early 1990s. Since 1999 they have lived in a brownstone condominium on fashionable Marlborough St. in the expensive Back Bay area just two blocks from the Boston Public Garden. The condo has more than 2,300 square feet of living space. “I have homes in Toronto, Geneva, and other places, but Boston is home. In fact, my favourite home of them all is on Marlborough Street,” they told Boston Magazine. They also told Boston Business Journal that they love “the uneven bricks in front of my place. I don't have a car. I walk everywhere, and I love Boston for that, and that's one of the great things about our city.”
Their favourite restaurant is Grill 23 and Bar at 161 Berkeley St., a trendy steak house just a five-block walk from their home. They sit across from the upstairs bar so they can watch sports on TV. Their top spot for conducting deals is a special table in a back corner of the Taj Boston Hotel, where they can watch the front door to see their guest arrive.

And their favourite sports teams aren't the Toronto Blue Jays or the Montreal Canadiens. Rather, they like the Boston Red Sox and is a huge New England Patriots football team fan, bragging that they never misses watching a game. Importantly, since they entered the leadership race two weeks ago, O'Leary won't talk about their future residency plans. Through their spokesperson this week, I asked only three questions: Will they continue to split their time between here and Boston if they become leader; will they run in the next election even if they lose the contest; and will they still appear on Shark Tank if elected leader? Not one question was answered. Instead, here is the entire reply: “Mr. O'Leary is committed to Conservatives and Canada. We are focusing our attention on signing up more members to help us build a strong campaign to form a majority Conservative government in 2019. “Kevin is focused on winning the Leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada and the response to Mr. O'Leary's candidacy is energized. Conservatives in Canada are tired of hearing the same double talk from Justin Trudeau. They ran on promises to be an open and transparent government — but we have only seen evidence to the contrary. “As I mentioned before Mr. O'Leary is committed to the Conservative Party of Canada and is focusing on winning the leadership and subsequently the General Election in 2019.” Telling, eh? Leading up to the 2011 federal election, the Tories ran a series of brutal, but effective, attack ads against Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff focusing on theirs having lived 34 years outside Canada. With a tag line of “Just Visiting,” the ads blasted Ignatieff, saying “He's not in it for you or for Canada. He's just in it for himself. It's the only reason he's back.” At least Ignatieff moved back to Canada full-time before entering politics. O'Leary won't even promise to do that if they become Tory leader. Are they “just visiting” even more than Ignatieff was? Bob Hepburn's column appears Thursday. bhepburn@thestar.ca

All the games are multilingual, in Czech, English and other languages.
The St. Valentine's Day Massacre
Capone and Company's botched plan
The St. Valentine's Day massacre—the most spectacular gangland slaying in mob history—was actually somewhat of a failure.
Al Capone had arranged for Chicago mobster George "Bugs" Moran and most of their North Side Gang to be eliminated on February 14, 1929. The plan, probably devised by Capone's henchman "Machine Gun" Jack McGurn, was simple and deviously clever, but Capone's primary target escaped.
The Plan
A bootlegger loyal to Capone would draw Moran and their gang to a warehouse under the pretense that they would be receiving a shipment of smuggled whiskey for a price that proved too good to be true. The delivery was set for a red brick warehouse at 2122 North Clark Street in Chicago at 10:30 a.m. on Valentine's Day.
Capone arranged to distance themselves from the assassinations by spending time at their home in Miami while the heinous act was committed.
The Morning of February 14, 1929
That snowy morning, a group of Moran's men waited for Bugs Moran at the warehouse. Among them were Jon May, an auto mechanic hired by Moran; Frank and Pete Gusenburg, who had previously tried to murder Machine Gun Jack McGurn; James Clark, Moran's brother-in-law; and Reinhardt Schwimmer, a young optometrist who often hung around for the thrill of sharing company with gangsters. Moran happened to be running a bit late.
When Moran's car turned the corner onto North Clarke, they and their lackeys, Willy Marks and Ted Newbury, spotted a police wagon rolling up to the warehouse. Figuring it was a bust they watched as five men—including three dressed in police uniforms—entered the warehouse. With the arrival of the "cops," Moran and Co. scrammed.
The Massacre
Inside the warehouse, Moran's men were confronted by the hit men disguised as police officers. Assuming it was a routine bust, they followed instructions as they were ordered to line up against the wall. The hit men then opened fire with Thompson submachine guns, killing six of the seven men immediately. Despite 22 bullet wounds, Frank Gusenberg survived the attack but died after arriving at Alexian Brothers Hospital.
After the attack, the uniformed perpetrators marched their plain-clothed accomplices out the front door with their hands raised, just in case anyone was watching. Capone's hit men piled into the police wagon and drove away.
The Aftermath
The newspapers instantly picked up on the crime, dubbing it the "St. Valentine's Day Massacre." The story appeared on front pages around the country, making Capone a nationwide celebrity. While Capone seemed to revel in their new fame, they also had to deal with the new level of attention from federal law enforcement officials.
George "Bugs" Moran knew Capone wanted them killed and pegged the crime on them right away. "Only Capone kills like that," they said, though authorities had no concrete evidence. Capone was in Florida and their henchman McGurn had an alibi of their own. No one was ever tried for this most spectacular slaying in mob history.
Can we all just get along?
I am among the small percentage of New Yorkers who drive to work every day — from Park Slope to Fort Greene. I am what many would call a cautious driver — sometimes to a fault.
When I get to a stop sign, I say the letters. S-T-O-P, just like in driver's ed. Then, I proceed when it's safe. I signal. I even turn my head 180 degrees when I make a turn.
But these days, what most concerns me is not necessarily the other motorists, but bicycle-motor vehicle crashes. At least nine cyclists have died on city streets this year, according to NYC figures.
It seems that bicyclists are the most dangerous group on NYC roads. I am not referring to the mindful tourists gently pedaling their blue Citi Bikes, but the rule-breaking cyclists who cause havoc.
When bike lanes appeared in my Park Slope neighborhood, I grumbled but eventually adjusted. Around that time, the NYC speed limit was lowered to 25 mph, a safety precaution that seems to be followed by many drivers.
For starters, all bicyclists are required by law to stop at red lights just like all drivers. Just because they have opted for a two-wheel transportation does not mean they are exempt from traffic laws. But many bicyclists constantly weave in and out of traffic without concern for pedestrians or other drivers.
Some New Yorkers argue that NYC should encourage cycling. I agree. It is cheaper transportation, helps our environment and is a healthy alternative to driving.
Sign up for amExpress, the conversation starter for New Yorkers. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.
What irks me most is the sense of entitlement many bicyclists exhibit. If a two-wheeler wants to make a turn, that's fine. They or they must signal properly and make sure the turn is legal and safe. And please just once, when you do something wrong — like cutting a car off or taking liberties on lane changes — please don't give drivers the finger. You often do. It's not only offensive, but it's also dangerous.
Keep your hands on the handlebars where they belong. Keep your eyes on the road, and maybe, just maybe, we can learn to better share the roads. It is more than just a peaceful coexistence.
With the increasing number of NYC cyclists, it is a matter of life and death.

Volos, Greece: Nocturnal protest march in direct solidarity with Delta squat and people in struggle
In the city of Volos on late Wednesday night, 12/9, we held a spontaneous meeting after hearing the news of Delta squat's eviction in Thessaloniki. Our discussion was followed by a protest march, starting from Aghiou Nikolaou square at 01.10am, where nearly 80 people took to the streets and passed nearby the police station and the overcrowded local coffee-bars. We went on to Dimitriados central street, walked down the seaside promenade and ended the march at the Palia square.
Many slogans were chanted in defense of squatting, practices of solidarity and the anarchist struggle, and against the State, cops and fascists. There were no police forces present, except for a secret police car and its ‘content'.
Squats, radical strikes, riots, guerilla struggle and every other form and choice of fighting towards the destruction of this system and the building of a society based on solidarity and equality, have our factual support, regardless of any existing disagreements.
No one who struggles, no one who is being prosecuted or imprisoned must stay alone facing this violent attack of the totalitarian capitalism and its republic. To create solidary relationships among the oppressed and exploited, as well as consistent and aggressive structures that will deprive authority and its supporters from their living space, is a one-way street.
Hands off squats! Hands off struggles and fighters!
SOLIDARITY IS OUR STRONGEST WEAPON
This is an illustration of the new species, Uromys vika. Image: Velizar Simeonovski, The Field Museum
The Solomon Islands—a nation comprised of nearly one thousand islands located northeast of Australia, between Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea—is an impressive corner of the globe. Dense, lush rainforest blankets the majority of the islands, and the country's coral reef biodiversity is among the richest in the world. Many of the plants and animals in the Solomon Islands have evolved in splendid isolation, and now, one of these animals has emerged from its idyllic surroundings, revealing itself to science for the first time: the vika (Uromys vika), a big-ass rat four times the size of even the heftiest of the familiar, city-slicker variety.
What, you were expecting a gorgeous tropical bird or something?
Described in a newly-published paper in the Journal of Mammalogy by researchers at Chicago's Field Museum and the Solomon Islands' Zaira Resource Management Area, the vika is a sight to behold. Including the scaly tail, the deep brown, robust rodent can be a foot and a half long, and can weigh as much as a pineapple. The vika, like its closest relatives, is an avid climber and likely spends most of its time high in the trees of the rainforest, clambering around in the middle of the night much like a possum. This new species can be distinguished from other Uromys species—many of which are also found in the Solomon Islands—by measurable differences in skull shape and by its genes. So far, the vika is only known from the island it was discovered upon, Vangunu.

While Uromys vika is “new” in the formal, scholastic sense, the animal was already a part of the traditional knowledge of Vangunu's residents. It was familiar to many people on the island as a beefy rat that liked to devour green coconuts, boring into them with its rugged incisors. Some of the earliest recorded accounts of the vika from locals include notes that it was supposedly common on some of the small, former plantation islands just offshore Vangunu. The vika's introduction to the scientific community came after years of searching, after lead study author Tyrone Lavery heard descriptions of the rat from Vangunu locals back in 2010. After much time and effort attempting to find the giant rat in Vangunu's rainforest, a single specimen was eventually found scrambling out of a felled tree. The observation and collection of a physical specimen was the final piece of the puzzle.
Currently, there is much to learn about the vika and its lifestyle. For example, it hasn't been confirmed via observations if the animal mows down on coconuts. However, on Vangunu, the nuts of the Canarium tree—galip nuts—have been found with round holes chewed into them and the interior meat removed. Given the specific type of teeth marks on these nut holes, it's thought that the newly-discovered giant rats are the culprits. If vika can drill through the thick walls of the galip nut, it's not farfetched to think that coconuts may indeed be on the menu as well.

The vika is the first rodent discovered in the Solomon Islands in 80 years, and fits into a remarkable pantheon of Solomon Island mammals, half of which are found nowhere else on Earth. Some of these include the dwarf flying fox (the smallest fruit bat in the world) and the Guadalcanal monkey-faced bat. This hotbed of mammalian endemism is largely due to the islands' position between landmasses: close enough for things to fly or float there occasionally, but far enough away to make leaving the islands difficult. The native land mammals of the Solomon Islands are almost exclusively bats and rats, both animals that are apparently quite good at reaching far-flung locations.
“Vika's ancestors probably rafted to the island on vegetation, and once they got there, they evolved into this wonderfully new species, nothing like what they came from on the mainland,” explained Lavery in a statement.
Tragically, so soon after its scientific debut, Lavery and their colleagues expect the vika will be immediately designated “critically endangered,” since it is so rare and its tiny native range on Vangunu is threatened with logging.

Why at least One Major Presidential Poll Isn't Telling the Whole Story
The Republican and Democratic parties have long since chosen their candidates for the presidency and polling organizations across the U.S. have done their best to understand how voters feels about Rep. Nominee Donald Trump and Dem. Nominee Hilary Clinton.
The short answer: not thrilled.
Real Clear Politics, as of Aug. 11th 2016, reports Clinton and Trump have an average un-favorability rating of 53.3% and 61.4%, respectively, among registered voters.
These statistics are mirrored by party affiliation numbers: Back in January, Gallup reported that only 26% of registered voters identify as Republicans, and Democrats have an equally disappointing share of the electorate as only 29% of those registered are self identified Democrats. Ahead of both major parties are the so called “silent majority”, Independents, at 42% of registered voters.
It's obvious after examining these numbers, that most voters aren't satisfied with the status quo that is the two-party system. One might expect this to be reflected in Presidential polls and indeed, third party candidates are receiving more support than seen in previous election cycles. Jill Stein, recently nominated by the Green Party, has seen their numbers go up following the Democratic nomination of Clinton over Bernie Sanders, while Gary Johnson, the Libertarian party's nominee, has polled as high as 13 percent in national polls and currently sits at about 9% according to RCP's calculated average. Republican and Democrats share the 90% left over, with Clinton ahead of Trump by about 7 points.
However, if more than half of registered voters don't like Trump or Clinton and the two major parties only represent about half of the electorate combined. Why aren't third party candidates seeing more support? The Washington Post seems to think that most voters are simply picking the lesser of two evils. While certainly this sentiment is shared by a fair amount of those who'll be going to the polls on election day, there might be another reason.
A recent poll of likely voters conducted by Reuters, shows Clinton at 40%, Trump at 35%, Johnson at 7% and Stein at 3%. Among Independents, Trump leads at 24% and Johnson is right behind with 22%, They are followed by Clinton at 18% percent and Stein in fourth at 9%.
If Independents make up around 42% of voters, how is it that Clinton is so far ahead of Trump and Johnson, the two biggest candidates among independents? The answer lies in the sample data. For this Poll, Reuters spoke with 1,459 different respondents. About 680 Democrats, 468 Republicans and 175 Independents.
So of those surveyed, Democrats make up about half, Republicans are around a third and Independents make up less than a quarter. That doesn't even come close to representing the reality of registered voter affiliations. This seems to be a pretty egregious case of sample bias from a reputable polling organization.
Why has such a glaring error occurred? How many polling organizations are using similar sample sizes? Is this a case of ineptitude or deliberate motivations? Whatever the case may be, IPSOS, at the very least, has a serious problem it needs to address.
As it stands,it looks like the vast majority of voters are being ignored.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ordered six companies to clean out several highly contaminated areas in an Indiana city with staggeringly high lead levels.
The EPA is requiring U.S.S. Lead, Atlantic Richfield, DuPont, Chemours, and other polluters to excavate contaminated soil in two areas of East Chicago with high levels of toxic soil. The companies will likely pay nearly $26 million to have the two cites decontaminated.
“We continue to make cleaning up East Chicago a priority, to protect the health and well-being of the residents who live in the impacted areas,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt in a press statement Monday. The agreement comes after Pruitt promised earlier this year that East Chicago's Superfund Site would become a priority for the EPA.
Pruitt was specifically referring to a small community where officials last summer began evacuating citizens from the West Calumet Housing Complex after they found some yards with lead levels more than 70 times the federal safety standard. There are nearly 50 people remaining in the housing complex.
The city was affected by contamination from a closed lead production facility owned by the firm U.S. Steel – East Chicago was designated a Superfund cleanup site by the agency in 2009.
“Getting toxic land sites cleaned up and revitalized is of the utmost importance to the communities across the country that are affected by these sites,” said Pruitt, who is trying to transition the agency from fighting manmade global warming specifically to protecting public health.
“I have charged the Superfund Task Force to immediately and intently develop plans for each of these sites to ensure they are thoughtfully addressed with urgency,” they added.
Pruitt is trying to refashion the EPA, transitioning the agency from one that fights manmade global warming to one that protects human health and the environment.
Other areas in that region have also wrestled with stubbornly high lead levels. Flint citizens filed a lawsuit in January, for instance, claiming the agency failed to take the proper steps to ensure that state and local authorities were addressing last year's water crisis. The defendants were seeking a civil action lawsuit for $722 million in damages.

Triple Formula One world Constructors' champions Mercedes have donated a pair of race suits worn by Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton to support the Italian population affected by the earthquake that recently befell their country.
Mercedes has given the autographed suits to Laureus Sport for Good Italia Foundation, with the memorabilia being auctioned in individual lots until Sunday 30 October via the charity stars.com website.
Rosberg's race suit was used at the 2016 Austrian, British, Hungarian, and German Grands Prix while Hamilton's equipment was worn at the Russian, Spanish, Monaco, Canadian and European Grands Prix.
Bids can be placed by visiting the website and registering with an email address and telephone number. The highest bidderat the end of the auction will be declared the winner and receive the suit shortly after.
It is worth mentioning that the latest bid on Hamilton's suit is €6,050, while Rosberg is currently fetching €3,600. Maybe this is due to the fact that Hamilton won two races (Monaco and Montreal) wearing the piece of motorsport equipment on offer, whereas Rosberg's suit coincides with their barren run in July.

(CNN) The author of a study that claims to show millions of illegal votes were cast in the presidential election refused to produce evidence support their allegation during a contentious and lengthy interview with CNN.
In 12-minute exchange with CNN's Chris Cuomo Friday, VoteStand founder Gregg Phillips alleged they have the names of three million individuals who voted illegally, but that they need more time to prepare a public report to ensure accuracy and because the work is being completed by volunteers.
"We're going to release all of this to the public. We are going to release our methodology and release the broad data and our conclusions and we're going to release everything to the public as soon as we get done with the checks," they said, when pressed by Cuomo. "(We) believe it will probably take another few months to get this done."
Phillips' remarks were apparently noticed by Trump, who tweeted minutes later that they were looking forward to reviewing the results of the investigation.
Look forward to seeing final results of VoteStand. Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017
Phillips, a former Texas Health and Human Services Commission deputy commissioner, is the founder of a self- described big data healthcare software company focused on eligibility, enrollment and data verification, according to their website.  They are also the founder of VoteStand, self-described as "the first mobile anti-vote fraud app," which appears to rely on users to submit evidence of suspected voter fraud.

ESPN's Brett McMurphy says Oregon will name South Florida coach Willie Taggart as its new head coach, adding that Taggart came highly recommended from former NFL coach Tony Dungy. (1:24)
Oregon to name Taggart as head coach, comes highly recommended by Dungy (1:24)
Oregon has hired South Florida's Willie Taggart as its next football coach, the school announced Wednesday.
Taggart will be officially introduced at a press conference Thursday morning.
They replace Mark Helfrich, who was fired by Oregon a week ago after going 4-8 overall and 2-7 in the Pac-12 this season.
Taggart and Mississippi State's Dan Mullen were the two finalists for the Oregon job, a source said.
Taggart had been at USF for four seasons, increasing their win total from two in their first season to four and then eight. This year's 10-2 record was the best in school history.
Taggart also was an assistant at Stanford from 2007 to 2009, and head coach at Western Kentucky from 2010 to 2012. When Taggart was at Stanford, they helped recruit quarterback Andrew Luck.

Stanford coach David Shaw called Taggert's hire a "big move for Oregon" and believes their former assistant will be a good fit in Eugene considering their pedigree on the offensive side of the ball.
"I think good coaches fit just about anywhere. Willie has shown that the last few years, particularly with their offense. They've been doing the right thing based on the talent they have," Shaw said. "They've switched it up a bit to more of a spread, but still being a physical running team. So I know that Willie and their staff will make smart decisions with the talent that they have at Oregon."
South Florida co-offensive coordinator T.J. Weist was named interim coach and will lead the 25th-ranked Bulls in the Birmingham Bowl. Athletic director Mark Harlan said a national search for a new coach will begin immediately.
Potential candidates for the South Florida job would include Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin, former LSU coach Les Miles, former Texas coach Charlie Strong, and Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano, sources told ESPN.
Other candidates include Florida State co-offensive coordinator Lawrence Dawsey (a former USF assistant) and Dallas Cowboys assistant coach Rich Bisaccia (a former Tampa Bay Buccaneers assistant).
Former NFL coach Tony Dungy, whose son Eric played at Oregon before transferring to USF to finish their career under Taggart, spoke to Oregon officials on Taggart's behalf.
"He knows the West Coast, having been at Stanford," Dungy told ESPN last week. "He has all the elements Oregon is looking for. He's a bright young coach, and it makes them easy to recommend.
"Oregon is a different situation [than USF]. You're not coming in taking something from the ground floor. You need a coach that can come in and get players going and coach well. It's a big challenge at Oregon, one that they would be successful at. You're not trying to become respectable. You're trying to win national championships -- it's a different kind of challenge."
ESPN's Chris Low, David Lombardi and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
I need to take a moment to apologize to my wonderful Halloween Santa for not posting everything earlier. I know how much it sucks not having your match put any effort into showing off the gift you got them! I finally have time now to sit down and share what an awesome match I got!
First thing I noticed about my gift was it was in a box in a bag. I didn't quite understand until I got up close and personal with it. I'm pretty sure the post office added the bag to the outside because this tricky person put GLITTER in the box and it was leaking out everywhere! I switched up my game plan and took the box to the deck to open instead of letting my living room be glitter bombed. My suspicions were confirmed as I opened the outer bag and was covered before I got into the box. After getting into the box I noticed it was filled with another bag! And glitter. Still lots and lots of glitter. I pulled the bag out and glitter. Everywhere. Inside the box, on the outside of the bag, IN the bag, on my pants, on my deck. I would never get rid of it all. I powered through and opened the bag to find it full of Halloween goodies! Candy, fake mustaches, googly eyes, a voodoo doll, a little coffin, a skull bowl, a bag of cat nip for my little kitty too! It had it all! I love everything in my treat box and jokes on you because I plan on using the glitter for some nail designs! I saved as much as I could :-) Chloe sends a big thank you also for their new bag of drugs! They attacked me as soon as I came back in the house. I think they could smell it through the box before I even opened it!
Dame Judi plays tough-talking M in the Bond films Every film in which actor Dame Judi Dench swears results in complaints, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has said in its annual report. A handful of film-goers objected to their use of an expletive in 12A-rated Bond movie Quantum of Solace, but the complaints were "expected", it said. The body, which certifies films, DVDs and games, has updated its guidelines. Releases will be vetted for issues of prejudice for the first time alongside violence, swearing and sexual content. More rigorous Issues of race, gender, sexuality and disability will be taken into account when the BBFC issues certificates. Under the new guidelines, a DVD box set of US comedy series Friends has been given a 12 rating instead of a PG because of the single use of the word spastic. The organisation, which has reviewed its guidelines for the first time in four years, has said that the tone and meaning will come under scrutiny as well as what appears on screen. It says that some releases which fall between two certificates could now be pushed into a more rigorous classification. The Dark Knight's 12A rating was criticised Rules about horror films have been tightened in the 12 and 12A category, meaning that 2001 release The Others, starring Nicole Kidman, would now be given a higher certificate. The BBFC came to their conclusions after consulting 8,700 people. It said that in the last year it received 853 e-mails and letters about its classifications. The decision to give hard-hitting film The Dark Knight a 12A certificate generated the most public concern, with 364 complaints being received by the BBFC. It put the complaints about one minor swear word in Quantum Of Solace down to the "Judi Dench factor". "This beloved actor plays M, Bond's tough-talking boss. However, it was their tough talking which upset the viewers," it said. "Almost every time Dame Judi swears in a film, regardless of its category, we can expect a number of complaints." BBFC president Sir Quentin Thomas also expressed concerns that children are able to access explicit material on the web too easily. They added that efforts to regulate content were difficult because many sites are operated from outside the UK.

Music is force powerful enough to calm a baby, soothe a wild beast, or compel the two to dance with each other. Be overcome by this deal to see Fuel, Saving Abel, Lotus Land Band, or LedZeppelin 2 at Altar Bar, presented by Drusky Entertainment.
Choose from Four Options
$7 for one general-admission ticket to see Lotus Land Band: Rush Tribute Band on Friday, July 13, at 8:30 p.m. (up to a $15.83 value, including all fees).<p>
With double necked guitars, thundering bass, and a drum kit that has its own zip code, the American Rush tribute band Lotus Land salutes the Canadian prog-rock legends in a set packed with the greatest hits such as “Tom Sawyer” and deep cuts designed to hook the most diehard Rush fans. Bassist Chris Nelson replicates Geddy Lee's skyscraping vocals, Bob Chartrand nails Alex Lifeson's guitar prowess, and Mark Dalton grows a third arm on command to summon the famous drumming style of Neal Peart. Opiate: A Tool Tribute Band opens.<p>
$11 for one general-admission ticket to see Saving Abel on Tuesday, July 17, at 7 p.m. (up to a $22.75 value, including all fees).<p>
Mississippi's Saving Abel deep-fry their meat and potatoes brand of rock and roll to a crackling Southern crisp. Best known for hit singles such as “Addicted” and “The Sex is Good,” and for their tours with contemporaries such as Nickelback, the genre-hopping band draws audiences into gregarious, rowdy live shows. Touring in support of the latest album Bringing Down the Giant, the band cranks out a hit list of hard rocking anthems, goodtime grooves, and tender ballads.<p>
$12 for one general-admission ticket to see Fuel on Wednesday, July 18, at 6:30 p.m. (up to a $25.55 value, including all fees).<p>
With original lead singer Brett Scallions back behind the mic, the four-headed hard rock hydra of Fuel returns with a full tank of combustible grooves. Known for late '90s hits such as “Shimmer” and “Hemorrhage (In My Hands),” the post-grungers racked up a score of platinum albums. Recharged with a new rhythm section featuring bassist Brad Stewart from Shinedown and Ken Schalk of Candiria on the skins, Fuel pumps out the monster hits that made them Fuel, steered by the prodigal Scallions' passionate bellow.<p>
$9 for one general-admisison ticket to see Led Zeppelin 2 – The Live Experience on Saturday, August 4, at 9 p.m. (up to a $19.66 value, including all fees). <p>
LedZeppelin 2 doesn't just cop the hooks and looks of the godfathers of hard, hobbit-esque rock. What sets the critically acclaimed New York band apart from other Zep clones is its diligent replication of an authentic Led Zeppelin concert. With swaggering improvisation, the group restages famous Zeppelin gigs from their garage days through the excess-loving heyday of The Song Remains the Same, complete with bowed guitars, tectonic drum solos, and virtuoso Plant-esque vocal histrionics. <p>
Scientists are claiming they have discovered a new species of monkey living in the remote forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo -- an animal well-known to local hunters but until now, unknown to the outside world. In a paper published in the open-access journal Plos One, the scientists describe the new species that they call Cercopithecus Lomamiensis, known locally as the Lesula, whose home is deep in central DR Congo's Lomami Forest basin. The scientists say it is only the second discovery of a monkey species in 28 years.
In an age where so much of the earth's surface has been photographed, digitized, and placed on a searchable map on the web discoveries like this one by a group of American scientists seems like a throwback to another time.
Tom Doherty Associates, publishers of Tor, Forge, Orb, Starscape, and Tor Teen, today announced that by early July 2012, their entire list of e-books will be available DRM-free.
“Our authors and readers have been asking for this for a long time,” said president and publisher Tom Doherty. “They're a technically sophisticated bunch, and DRM is a constant annoyance to them. It prevents them from using legitimately-purchased e-books in perfectly legal ways, like moving them from one kind of e-reader to another.”
DRM-free titles from Tom Doherty Associates will be available from the same range of retailers that currently sell their e-books. In addition, the company expects to begin selling titles through retailers that sell only DRM-free books.
In addition, Tor UK announced on Wednesday, April 25 that it will also be going DRM-free.

From NikkieTutorials' Ofra Highlighters to Dose of Colors Eye Shadow, dropping a makeup line is a huge rite of passage for any beauty influencer. Now, we can add another name to the list, because vlogger Alissa Ashley is launching an E.L.F. lip gloss!
The YouTube star, who has nearly 800,000 followers, is known for their beauty tutorials, blinding highlight game, and always-glossy lips. So it makes sense that Alissa's very first product launch would include such a shiny lippie.
Whereas one year ago, everyone was dropping matte lipsticks like it was going out of style (anyone remembers the MAC Influencer Lipstick line?), Fall 2017 is all about getting glossy.

This could be for many reasons. For one, the sparkle of a lip gloss plays beautifully off of this season's trendy metallic eye shadow. Also, a matte look is tough to rock when Fall's frosty weather dries our your lips. Alissa's take? "I think people like gloss again because it makes your lips look so pouty and adds somewhat of an effortless feel to makeup," they told POPSUGAR via email.
Alissa is clearly a gloss girl, but if you don't share their enthusiasm for the formula, this release was made to convert you. For one, Alissa worked to make their gloss "smooth, high shine, and pigmented." Rather than drag across your lips like the 2000s gloss tubes of yore, this offering "isn't super heavy or sticky on the lips," Alissa claimed.
Image Source: E.L.F. Cosmetics
Indeed, Alissa wore the gloss in the launch's promotional images, and the result will give you major lip envy. The pink-brown praline color just might remind you of the drugstore version of Fenty Beauty's covetable Gloss Bomb. Much like with Fenty, inclusivity was a major goal of Alissa's. "I chose this color because it's one that anyone could wear," they said.
Adding to that accessability is the price point: ringing in at under $10, the Alissa Ashley Lip Gloss ($6) probably costs less than your dry cleaning. If you want to try it out for yourself, you'll be able to scoop this tube up on Oct. 24 in E.L.F. stores and online.
PORTLAND, Ore. — The Portland Timbers and Providence Health & Services today announced a new deeply integrated community partnership. The multiyear deal is founded in health and wellness initiatives and events throughout the region as well as a name change of the Major League Soccer (MLS) club's historic downtown home venue to Providence Park, which annually plays host to home games for the Timbers, Portland Thorns FC and a wide variety of sports, entertainment and community-related events.
Providence, a not-for-profit health care provider committed to giving back to the communities it serves, and the Timbers made the announcement together today at Providence Park. The robust and integrated partnership features a number of important community initiatives, including the revival of the Special Olympics Oregon Fall Games in 2014, outreach efforts through the Timbers' Stand Together platform, and partnering on youth soccer camps and field-related projects. Providence will become a Founding Partner of the Portland Timbers Community Fund and a presenting partner of the Timbers' Hispanic community outreach platform, “Somos Timbers.”
“Just like Providence, the Timbers and Thorns have a proven track record of giving back to the community,” says Dave Underriner, chief executive for Providence in Oregon. “Together, we'll bring the spirit of the people of Providence alongside the Timbers and Thorns to reach out to the community in new and exciting ways.”
The new partnership between the Timbers and Providence, Oregon's largest private employer, expands upon an established relationship between the two organizations. Built as part of recent renovations to the stadium, the Providence Sports Care Center is a 12,000 square foot, state-of-the-art sports care center located at the Southeast corner of Providence Park, and serves both the community and professional athletes. Providence will continue as the presenting partner and primary jersey partner of Thorns FC, the defending National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) champions, and the team's community initiatives.
"I am thrilled to announce our new, expanded community partnership with Providence Health & Services,” said Merritt Paulson, president of the Timbers. “This partnership signifies a huge commitment to the community from the largest private employer in Oregon, which will keep Providence Park the name of our facility for years to come. Additionally, I want to thank JELD-WEN for their past and continued significant commitment to the Portland Timbers."
JELD-WEN Windows & Doors, the stadium naming-rights partner for the Timbers' first three seasons in MLS, will continue to serve as one of the club's Founding Partners and will continue its involvement in the Timbers' community outreach, including the Score-a-Goal, Plant-a-Tree program. JELD-WEN Windows & Doors will remain the Official Window and Door Provider of Major League Soccer and the Timbers.
“JELD-WEN has greatly enjoyed being a part of the Timbers' community. We are looking forward to continuing our involvement as a founding partner and our association with the team and the sport,” said Bill Hueffner, vice president for JELD-WEN. “We are extremely proud to have been one of the original supporters and sponsors of the team and the stadium at a monumental time in both of their histories.”
As part of the partnership with the Timbers, Providence will continue to share its health and wellness initiatives for youth, including the Play Smart heart screening and concussion awareness programs, through the annual Health & Fitness School Days for local youth in conjunction with Portland Timbers U-23s games at Providence Park. Providence is already committed to the “Tix for Kids” program, providing tickets for local underprivileged youth to attend home games for the Timbers and Thorns.
“Every Timbers game is a teachable moment to encourage fitness and wellness at any age,” said James Beckerman, M.D., cardiologist for the Providence Heart and Vascular Institute and the Timbers. “Standing together, with the Timbers, we look forward to inspiring the people in our communities to be more active, lead healthier lives and have fun.”
Providence Park will be a home site for the first Special Olympics Oregon Fall Games since 2008. The Fall Games will provide more than 600 athletes, 200 coaches and an additional 200 volunteers from across the state of Oregon the opportunity to compete and participate in a variety of events, including soccer. The stadium will continue to serve as the home to several popular health and wellness events, including the Providence Bridge Pedal Health & Wellness Expo and kickoff activities for Providence Hood to Coast.
"What an honor to partner with the Portland Timbers and Providence Health & Services to promote health and wellness in our great state," said Margaret Hunt, CEO of Special Olympics Oregon. "The return of Special Olympics Oregon's State Fall Games is going to make thousands of Oregonians with intellectual disability and their families statewide very, very excited. For our athletes to play soccer at Providence Park is a dream come true."
The multi-dimensional partnership will provide Providence with exclusive exposure and signage inside and outside of Providence Park, including marquee signage at the main entrances; state-of-the-art, field-level LED signage during Timbers and Thorns FC home matches; and additional promotional elements throughout Providence Park's concourses.
Providence Park will play host to a variety of sports and entertainment events each year, including home games for the Timbers, defending-NWSL champion Thorns, and select Timbers U-23s games. Additionally, Providence Park will be the site of collegiate and high school athletic events, youth soccer camps, community events, concerts, and both private and public functions utilizing the many state-of-the-art amenities and gathering spaces at the downtown Portland venue. Fans will be able to access up-to-date information on Providence Park and its complete calendar of events in the coming days at www.ProvidenceParkPDX.com.
Note to media: All references to the Timbers and Thorns FC's home stadium now should be Providence Park.

Louis C.K. is mastering the art of surprising their fans. Last year, they dropped a Web series titled Horace and Pete on their site with little fanfare. At the top of this year, they performed a handful of previously unannounced stand-up sets in cities like Vancouver, Washington, D.C., and Boston. And now he's upping the ante on a cinematic scale. The __Los Angeles Times reports that C.K. secretly filmed a movie in New York earlier this year: a black-and-white, 35mm feature titled I Love You, Daddy. The film will premiere at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, officially entering the fray of potential Oscar hopefuls that swarm the definitive fest each fall.
I Love You, Daddy, which is a little over two hours long, is about a TV producer and writer named Glen Topher and their daughter, China (played by Chloe Grace Moretz), per the L.A. Times. The cast also includes John Malkovich, Edie Falco, Charlie Day, and Better Things creator Pamela Adlon, a regular C.K. collaborator.
Stealthily making a film might explain C.K.'s continued distance from their hit FX series Louie. For years, fans have wondered whether they will ever make another season of the sad, sad comedy, which has been dormant since the Season 5 finale in 2015. Over the years, C.K. has explained their reluctance to keep it going, saying last year that they simply can't think of good stories for the show's autobiographical main character anymore. At the Television Critics Association earlier this August, C.K. gave a slightly less nebulous answer, slamming yet another nail in Louie's coffin.
“I don't think the version of Louie that was on FX, I don't think I'll do that exact version again because I just haven't been that guy for a while with the stained blacked T-shirt and the two kids because they're older now,” they said, per Variety. “I always thought if I did Louie again, I may go back to it later in a different version. No idea if I'll do it—I don't think about it much.”
C.K. is essentially at the forefront of the new TV auteur movement to take your damn time with projects between seasons. But unlike figures like Aziz Ansari and Noah Hawley, C.K. seems a lot more determined to leave their hit show behind completely—letting it drift into the ether of modern dramedy classics.
Debuting I Love You, Daddy at TIFF also sends a very particular message about C.K.'s film aspirations. The comedian hasn't directed a feature since Pootie Tang in 2001, though they have directed episodes of Louie and Horace and Pete over the years. TIFF has consistently served as the North American barrier to entry for awards season hopefuls, prestige films that want to make it all the way to the Oscars. And C.K.—an Emmy and Peabody Award winner celebrated in the industry as a brilliant eccentric—directing a black-and-white film with a sharp cast seems about as Oscar bait-y as they come.
Vereniki Goneva has signed for Newcastle Falcons
Fiji international Vereniki Goneva will leave the Leicester Tigers over the summer and join Aviva Premiership rivals Newcastle.
Goneva, who can play on the wing or as a centre, has scored 26 Aviva Premiership tries since joining the Tigers four years ago, where they won the title in their first season.
Capped 39 times by their country, Goneva was named in the 2013-14 Premiership Dream Team, and signing the 31-year-old is a big coup for the Falcons, according to director of rugby Dean Richards.
"We are getting not only a world-class player with Vereniki, but also somebody who has consistently proven they can thrive in the Aviva Premiership," Richards said.
"He will bring another dimension to our back-line firepower from next season onwards, and it says much for the current standing of the Falcons that we can attract a player of their calibre.
"I am sure our supporters will enjoy the style and cutting edge that they bring to our play, and this is the sort of acquisition which really makes a statement about the ambition of everybody at Kingston Park."
Uh-oh. Over the weekend Nicholas Kristof's column in The New York Times bore the headline: “Canada, leading the free world.”
Now, as everyone knows, The New York Times is a “failing” newspaper, a “seriously failing” newspaper, a “back-of-the-pack, dying” newspaper and on top of that “Not nice!” Those, of course, are the categorizations of it by candidate, President-elect and now President Donald J. Trump. The Times' real-time tracking of Trump's insults reports they have referred to the paper as “failing” at least 39 different times. But even if the Times is “losing thousands of subscribers” and has “dwindling subscribers and readers,” Trump's almost daily insults indicate they themselves still reads it. So they almost certainly saw the “Canada leading” headline.
Canada-U.S. relations always depend at least a little on the psychologies of the two countries' leaders. In practice, Trump seems to be doing everything they can to abdicate the U.S.'s postwar role as leader of the free world. But they have such an aversion to losing that, even though they may not want the job himself, they won't like it one bit that someone else gets it.
Mind you, the switch might have occurred a while ago: After our 2015 election Peggy Noonan wrote in The Wall Street Journal that “an interesting question for history is who was the real leader of the West the past half-dozen years, Angela Merkel of Germany or Canada's Stephen Harper.”
What does Trump think about those from blacklisted countries now sitting on their northern border?
If the president got even a paragraph into Kristof's column, they would have seen it was mainly about our leadership (compared to the U.S., at least) on refugees. We're not necessarily more enlightened than other nations, Kristof argues, and we have our share of bigots and haters, as the Quebec City shooting made clear (when was the last time six Muslims were murdered in the U.S.?). But our intake of Syrian refugees was much greater than the U.S.'s, especially when you consider we have one-tenth the population. Some things we're doing right.
So what does President Trump think when they read about the flood of refugees into Canada, many from Syria and their seven blacklisted countries? (OK, it's not a flood, but they live by exaggeration.) They probably think, or Steve Bannon thinks for him, that it's time to thicken the Canada-U.S. border. Maybe not build a wall—although some Canadians might be thinking that as more and more refugees walk up from the States even in the dead of winter (and “dead” is the right term for it in Manitoba in mid-February). But they would certainly think about being more careful screening at the U.S.'s northern border, its potentially leaky roof, for what's the point of getting tough on people going directly to the U.S. from failed nations if they can get there through Canada?
We obviously shouldn't change our refugee policy just because President Trump doesn't like it. But we'd better work as hard as we can to make sure people we let in aren't bad or don't turn bad once here. We got enough grief for the fake factoid that the 9/11 madmen came through Canada. If some future terrorist really does enter from Canada, that would be bad enough in itself, even without considering the repercussions at the border.
Accept Kristof's premise for a moment. Suppose we are leading the free world. Where do we, shining city on a snow bank, want to take it?
Are we progressive, standing for a non-discriminating but also essentially undiscriminating mushy cultural relativism and not much else? Feel free to come here and be whatever you will and don't mind too much what we locals think. Or will we be liberals, planting our flag on individual freedom, open borders, free trade and restrained government?
It is more than rich that it falls to the Liberal party to defend low tariffs and open borders. Through the 1970s, Pierre Trudeau practiced, albeit less boorishly, an economic nationalism not unlike Trumpism, while in 1988 John Turner led the party in outright opposition to free trade with the United States.
Going farther back in Liberal history, however, in 1911 their greatest leader, Wilfrid Laurier, campaigned for free trade with the U.S., although they lost to protectionist Tories. But history can take strange turns and America's retreat from the openness it has championed since 1934 is not just a turn but a careening.
In 2017, the Liberals' biggest donors get membership in the Laurier Club, which Sir Wilfrid themselves founded 99 years ago. Let's hope that in leading the world, Justin Trudeau stays true to Laurier's free-trading liberalism, not their father's economic nationalism.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- WREG explores a controversial solution to reducing violence in Memphis among young people. The Department of Justice is recommending raising the minimum age for those who can be tried as adults.
Under the proposed plan, those as old as 24 years old could be treated as juveniles.
The recommended change is creating a big debate, especially among victims.
“They knew that was not their car and they went there to do just what they did and take my son's life,” said Ruth Wilkins.
Three guys are charged with killing Wilkins' grandson. Police say they shot Larry Wilkins in a robbery after they answered a Craigslist ad to buy their Ford Mustang.
Twenty-one-year-old Brandon Vance went straight to criminal court. A juvenile court magistrate decided the other two, Martiness Henderson and Walter Collins, who were both 17 years old at the time, would also be tried as adults.
“At 17 years old, 16 years old, I don't care how old or how young you are. If you plan to do something like that, you should be considered as an adult,” said Larry Wilkins, Sr., the victim's father.
Under a plan by the U.S. Department of Justice, all three suspects might have the opportunity to be treated as juveniles. The federal agency is recommending juvenile courts raise the age of teens they serve from 18 years old to somewhere between 21 and 24 years old.
"Young people who commit these types of crimes are not always thinking correctly,” said John Hall, a former juvenile probation officer.
Hall spent 30 years working in juvenile justice and now consults for the Justice Department. They say the change is based on brain development.
“In research, a neuroscientist says that youth is not fully developed until the ages of 18 to 24,” said Hall.
WREG visited the JIFF program and saw teens that are similar to the young offenders the Justice Department is talking about. JIFF stands for Juvenile Intervention and Faith Based follow-up. They were learning about the culinary arts, but not by choice. Juvenile court sent them to JIFF after they got into trouble.
Most of the teens in JIFF have been arrested an average of five times each, and some even committed violent crimes.
JIFF executive director, Richard Graham said, “The number one thing we focus on is changing the youth's relative value system. From this is the way that I roll. This is the culture I was born into to one of an absolute value system.”
At 18 years old, the teens are no longer part of JIFF. Graham says some of them still need the services, but JIFF needs more private donors to expand the program or juvenile court would have to raise the age of those it serves.
Raising the age of juvenile court is something the chief administrator of the court thinks they might need to do.
“Until they're age 21, I think that would be a good compromise,” said Larry Scroggs of Shelby County Juvenile Court.
Scroggs thinks 24 may be too old for juvenile court, but says cutting services at 18 often is too early. They say the problem is where to house them.
"You cannot put a 14-year-old with a 20-year-old or 21-year-old, so there would have to be some special housing for them,” said Scroggs.
Even if the Department of Justice approved the plan, it would need to convince families like the Wilkinses.
“If they want to change the law, I don't think it's right,” said Wilkins, Sr.
They added, “If the crime is heinous like you go out and kill somebody to take something, you made a decision that you're grown and that's the decision you have to live with."
Police say it was one of the 17-year-olds who pulled the trigger, killing Wilkins' son.
Mother, sister of ‘surrendered Naxal' Kartam Mukka, in Samsetti village of Sukma. They are surprised at claim.
Chitu Sori of Kodenar village in Kondagaon district is a farmer. On June 26, police declared that the 25-year-old had “surrendered” with several fellow villagers. This was the beginning of an unprecedented run of “surrenders” by Maoists in Chhattisgarh this year. In their records, however, Sori is merely shown to have provided occasional help to Maoists. They returned to their village after the “surrender” and continues living there.

Among the residents of Atulpara village in Sukma who “surrendered” on August 19 were Barse Deva, Madkam Deva and Podiyam Deva. Like many tribals of Bastar, they had long-pending warrants against them, with police often booking villagers in bulk on any suspicion. These warrants were never executed, but this year, the three say, police proposed that if they “surrendered”, the warrants would be withdrawn.
A resident of Chingnar village of Narayanpur, Dayaram Nag provided rations occasionally to Maoists. On September 14, they were among those who “surrendered”.
Chaitram Salam had worked with the Maoists for some years but for a while now had been living in Narayanpur, when police asked them to “surrender” on August 25 in lieu of some benefits.

Going by the Chhattisgarh Police's records, none of the above cases from Bastar is eligible to be called a “surrendered Maoist”. They are not alone.
Between June 1 and November 28, a total of 377 alleged Maoists are reported to have surrendered in the Maoist-dominated Bastar division, 155 in November alone. A scrutiny of police records and meetings with these “surrendered” Maoists show that at least 270 of the 377 are actually ordinary villagers or routine criminals not eligible to be termed “surrendered Maoists”.
Not one of the 377 surrendered with a weapon, and no one has got the post-surrender relief or rehabilitation. Over 80 per cent of those who surrendered continue living in their villages, the remaining ones in police camps.
In contrast, in the two and a half years from January 2012 to May 2014, the seven districts of Bastar saw only 29 Maoist surrenders.
A week before the deadliest attack on the CRPF in four years by Naxals, in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district, the Union Home Ministry cited record surrenders in the state as a measure of its successful anti-Maoist policy. On November 26, the state saw the surrender of 63 more such alleged Maoists, the biggest ever in one go.
Bastar IG S R P Kalluri, whose tenure beginning June 10 has seen a surge in surrenders, says they are “not concerned about the eligibility criteria or the surrender policy”. It is a “new strategy for winning an ideological war against Maoists”, they assert. By wooing tribals through surrenders, police can break the first line of Maoist defence, Kalluri says.
“Earlier anti-Maoism meant mark area and go for police operations… I have dispatched hundreds of letters in interior villages urging people to join us. People are coming from across rivers. If they want to embrace democracy, should I embrace them or insult them by saying you are not eligible for surrender?” they say.
About why police let them return to their villages though Maoists could target them, Kalluri says: “We give them a choice. Bastar tribal is a free-spirited person, they enjoy forests and rivers and is not interested in your surrender policy.”
Significantly, even the Home Department of Chhattisgarh doesn't appear comfortable with these numbers. A letter sent to DGP A N Upadhyaya and all police superintendents on August 20 cautioned that “the police should focus on the surrender of important cadres instead of lower-rung cadres”.
Earlier, on January 10, then Chhattisgarh DGP Ramniwas had written to all IGs and SPs asking them to avoid the hype around non-deserving surrenders, saying it “confused our ground police personnel to bear wrong priorities” and “disorients” them from their focus.
While the district police can present anyone as a surrendered Naxal, a committee at the Raipur Police Headquarters headed by the ADG (Special Intel Bureau) is meant to scrutinise every case and to decide the rehabilitation package.
“We can take action against Maoist supporters depending on the nature of support they provided but only a person who was an active member of any banned organisation at the time of surrender should be considered eligible for surrender,” says ADG (SIB) R K Vij. “We are scrutinising the cases.”
The 377 surrendered persons fall under four broad categories:
a) “Naxali sahayogis” or people who have occasionally helped the rebels, by choice or force, with rations or shelter. So far, the police would detain such villagers and release them after interrogation.
IG Kalluri defends: “Imagine a boy of an interior village who has performed an occasional task of courier or sentry for the Maoists. If this boy wants to surrender, should I say that you are not a cadre or should I appreciate that they are impressed by democracy?”
b) People with warrants, who are pressured to surrender as a quid pro quo for withdrawal of cases. Only courts have the authority to withdraw criminal cases but, says Kalluri, “I tell them I am duty bound to send you before court and put you in jail. If I have to let you free, the only alternative is to show you as a surrendered Maoist. I use my judgment.”
Admits ADG Vij, “It is not within the jurisdiction of a police officer to withdraw warrants.”
c) Former Maoists, who left the rebel camp long ago and are now leading a family life.
d) Active Maoists or those belonging to banned front outfits. Under the policy, only they are eligible for surrender, and they make up the smallest number among all the four categories.
Argues Kalluri, “By surrenders Maoists develop a sense of belonging with police. Others will follow their example, we will get bigger cadres.”
However, contrary to what the IG says, branding ordinary villagers Naxal may neither benefit them nor may be necessary. While it leaves them open to future harassment, there are several schemes for tribal welfare that can also help bring them into the “mainstream”.
A surrendered Naxal is entitled to an “immediate grant” of at least Rs 1.5 lakh by the Centre and Rs 1 lakh by the state, “a monthly stipend of Rs 4,000 for maximum 36 months”, besides cash award between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1 crore depending on their or their designation. However, only around 100 persons have received “relief” so far, that too just Rs 2,000-Rs 5,000 as “Protsahan Rashi (encouragement amount)”. Less than 10 have got Class IV jobs.
Kalluri agrees this could discourage other Maoists seeking to surrender. “It is up to the government to take ten steps,” they say. “Maoists go to Andhra Pradesh after surrender as they are treated there like kings.”
None of the 136 Maoists to have surrendered in Chhattisgarh from January 2009 to May 2014 has received any benefits either.

In a statement last week, the spokesperson of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of Maoists, Gudsa Usendi, accused the Chhattisgarh police of “big fraud” in the name of Naxal surrenders, saying they pocketed the entire reward amount.
BALTIMORE -- Cal Ripken Jr. aspires to become president and CEO of a major league baseball team.
For now, the Hall of Fame infielder is satisfied with their current title: U.S. Public Diplomacy Envoy, a position that provides them the opportunity to embark next week on a nine-day mission through Japan as a sports diplomat on behalf of the State Department.
Ripken and former Baltimore Orioles teammate Brady Anderson are scheduled to lead baseball and softball clinics in Tokyo, Takarazuka and Kyoto. They also will travel to Ofunato, a city recovering from the March earthquake and tsunami.
The trip will run from Nov. 8-16.
"We communicate through baseball," Ripken said in an interview with The Associated Press. "Japan loves their baseball, maybe equally much or more than we do. It's a fabric of their country in many ways, and in times of disaster or tragedy or when you're a little down, sometimes sports can be a distraction. So when we go over there, we're going to be communicating through baseball to give them a distraction and an enjoyment that's real."
This will be Ripken's third trip as a Public Diplomacy Envoy. They traveled to China in 2007 and to Nicaragua in 2008. A 2008 trip to South Africa was scrapped because of scheduling issues.
Ripken earned the nickname "Iron Man" for playing in 2,632 consecutive games. Along the way they broke the major league record held by Lou Gehrig (2,130) and the mark in Japan set by Sachio Kinugasa (2,215), who will join Ripken and Anderson at the clinics in Tokyo and Ofunato.
Ripken previously visited Japan to play in All-Star games pitting major leaguers against Japanese teams.
"I enjoyed those trips and their love of baseball," Ripken said. "I loved meeting (Japanese slugger) Sadaharu Oh. They have a rich history of their own baseball, and I love being around it."
Some of the children that Ripken will be instructing have already met him. In August, 16 Japanese youth baseball and softball players traveled to the U.S. for a three-week exchange.
"I really enjoyed working with them when they came over here," Ripken said. "Part of the value of this program is to get to know them a little bit."
Now it's time for Ripken and Anderson to finish out the home-and-home schedule.
"A lot of the times, I find I learn more than I teach," said Anderson, who will making their first trip as a sports diplomat.
"When I was thinking about who could help on the mission, spread goodwill and be with kids and all that, Brady's name was at the top of this list," Ripken said.
Ripken took former teammate B.J. Surhoff to China and visited Nicaragua with one-time Oriole Dennis Martinez.
Upon retiring after the 2001 season, Ripken resisted offers to return to the game, saying they wanted to watch their children grow up. Their youngest child, Ryan, is poised to graduate in spring.
Ripken had discussions last summer with Orioles owner Peter Angeles and then-president of baseball operations Andy MacPhail about a potential role with the team in the future.
"Certainly the realization was that the timing wasn't right," Ripken said. "I made a decision to be there for my kids when I retired and that hasn't changed. I want to make sure I'm able to enjoy Ryan's senior year and then get them off to college. I really haven't thought much beyond that."
In the meantime, he's stayed busy as chairperson and founder of Ripken Baseball, Inc., which owns two minor league teams and runs the business operations for the Tampa Bay Rays' spring training site in Florida.
Ripken says he's been asked to interview as a big league manager "a couple times," but watching the World Series last month convinced them that they might be happier working in the front office.
"If you look at what Nolan Ryan is doing down in Texas, that's the model you would aspire to," Ripken said, referring to the president and CEO of the AL-champion Rangers. "He has the ability to impact some of the day-to-day decisions, but also has the ability to shape an organization. I think if you were shooting at something, that would be something that you would shoot for."
[Ed. Note: be sure to catch emptywheel's previous post regarding the release today of Cheney's interview materials.]
There is a lot in Cheney's interview report–we'll have a busy weekend. But for the moment, let's start with this bit:
After the Vice President again mentioned that they were pressed for time, two separate requests were made to Vice President Cheney in an effort to assist the DOJ/FBI investigation into this matter. First, an FBI waiver form was presented to the Vice President and copies were given to their attorneys. It was explained to Vice President Cheney that their signature was being sought on the waiver form in order to release any reporters with whom the Vice President may have had conversations about the subject matter of this investigation, from promises of confidentiality arising from any such conversations. Vice President Cheney acknowledged receipt of the FBIs waiver form but declined to sign until their attorneys have had sufficient time to review it.
Cheney refused to release the reporters they spoke with of confidentiality.
Now, over the course of their interview, Cheney was asked and they denied speaking with Novak and Cooper (and claimed to have no knowledge of discussions with Judy). The sole key journalist in question they didn't deny any knowledge about was Woodward (and, though less important, Andrea Mitchell). But they basically denied speaking to any journalist.
And then they refused to sign a waiver of confidentiality over their conversations with journalists.
Couple that with a few more data points.
When Libby was first asked to sign such a waiver, they too refused to sign it. When Novak was first asked to testify, they refused to testify until they could limit their testimony to those who had signed such waivers (and they originally limited it to Armitage, Rove, and Harlow). The only question Judy Miller refused to provide some answer to when I posed a bunch of questions about their involvement was about seeing Cheney in Jackson when they saw Scooter (the Aspen comment). After Novak was interviewed in September 2004, someone–presumably Fitzgerald–searched for records of contacts between Novak and the White House on a bunch of days, including July 7, 2003, the day before Novak spoke with Armitage. Judy refused to testify about their conversations on this subject until they could limit their conversations to Libby.
If Cheney spoke to both Novak and Judy–and there's reason to believe they might have–he refused to expose those conversations to the scrutiny of Fitzgerald.
icGrep: The Modern Grep Replacement
Building off the Parabix transform representation of text as well as the highly-regarded LLVM compiler infrastructure, icGrep is the modern replacement for the venerable grep utility, offering fundamentally parallel and consistently high-performance search as well as broad support for Unicode regular expressions.
icGrep embodies a completely new algorithmic approach to high-performance regular expression matching. In contrast to the byte-at-a-time approach of NFA, DFA, and backtracking matchers, icGrep 1.0 processes UTF-8 input streams 128 code units at a time using the SSE2 technology available on all x86-64 processors. The fundamental notion underlying icGrep is that of bitwise data parallelism as described in our 2014 PACT paper: Cameron, Robert D., Thomas C. Shermer, Arrvindh Shriraman, Kenneth S. Herdy, Dan Lin, Benjamin R. Hull, and Meng Lin. ​Bitwise data parallelism in regular expression matching. In Proceedings of the 23rd international conference on Parallel architectures and compilation, pp. 139-150. ACM, 2014. Building on that research, Dale Denis implemented the first version of icGrep for their MSc thesis. Nigel Medforth and Rob Cameron with the assistance of Nick Sumner then moved on to do the additional software engineering work to complete version 1.0 including full support for Unicode level 1 requirements.
icGrep is under continuing active development as we work towards implementation of Unicode level 2 requirements as well as advancing the underlying technology.
Predictable, Consistent Performance
icGrep 1.0 Performance
While GNU grep and other grep utilities often exhibit dramatic slowdown for complex regular expressions involving ambiguous subexpressions, case insensitive matching or large Unicode character classes, icGrep offers consistent high performance in all cases. In many such cases, icGrep is more than 100X faster than the competition, although a 5-10X ratio is more common.
icGrep has a significant compilation overhead that may dominate searches in short files of less than 10MB in size.
icGrep also has the overhead of applying the Parabix transform to input text, roughly about 1 CPU cycle per byte on modern processors. However, once transformed, the bitwise data parallel methods of icGrep often allow searches to conclude within an additional 1 CPU cycle per byte, much faster than is possible with a traditional byte-at-a-time loop.
For simple, fixed string searches, grep and other utilities can employ Boyer-Moore type algorithms to sometimes outperform icGrep. But not by much.
Performance Roadmap
icGrep 1.0 is a single-threaded search tool relying on widely available SSE2 technology and the LLVM 3.5 compiler infrastructure. However, our research work has shown that we can accelerate icGrep using multithreading with pipeline parallelism, wider SIMD technologies such as the 256-bit AVX2 technology on current Intel processors, and improved compiler support for the Parabix primitives in our custom LLVM version.
Within icGrep 1.0, the MatchStar primitive elegantly handles Kleeene-* repetitions of character classes (e.g. [a-z]*) using a single long-stream addition operation together with bitwise logic. Other Kleene-* repetitions are currently handled using while loops, but it is known that the MatchStar technique can be adapted to apply in some cases. Codifying and extending these techniques is an important area for algorithmic work.
Unicode Support
ICgrep 1.0
icGrep 1.0 accepts ASCII or UTF-8 input files and provides a full suite of Unicode processing features meeting the requirements of Unicode Level 1 support of ​Unicode Technical Standard #18. See Unicode Level 1 Support in icGrep for details.
icGrep Unicode Roadmap
We are pleased to be moving forward with implementation of Unicode Level 2 support within icGrep with the support of a ​Google Faculty Research Award.
icGrep Regular Expression Syntax
icGrep uses an extended regular expression syntax broadly compatible with egrep and including both the "Perl-compatible" extensions of PCRE and the Unicode regular expression features of the ICU software distribution. icGrep does not support back references. For more details, see the ICgrepSyntax page.

The White House's updated tax proposal is not likely to include a tax hike on the rich, a senior official said Monday.
The president's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, had been lobbying for a rate increase on the country's top earners to offset cuts for low- and middle-income Americans.
In their latest pitch, Bannon suggested that anyone make more than $5 million a year be taxed at 44 percent instead of the present rate of 39.6 percent.
Marc Short, legislative affairs director to Trump, told DailyMail.com on Monday that a rate hike would not be part of the principles that the White House submits to Congress, however.
'We believe that raising taxes is not a formula for growth, so I don't think that you will see us looking to raise rates on any particular individual or level,' Short said during a gaggle with reporters.

The president's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, had been lobbying for a rate increase on the country's top earners to offset cuts for low- and middle-income Americans. It won't be part of the White House's tax push, though
The White House is hell-bent on passing the tax reform package that President Donald Trump promised before the end of the year.
It's pushing an aggressive schedule that will see legislation go through mark up in both the House and the Senate in early September, then go to the floor in the lower chamber in October.
The upper chamber will take up their bill in November, according to Short's schedule.
'We will have success. This is a pass-fail exercise, and we will pass tax reform,' Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Monday at an Americans for Prosperity event.
Short seconded Mnuchin and said: 'Not only is it something that we would like to do, it's something that we have to do this year.'
Trump is turning their attention to tax reform following the collapse of major legislation to repeal Obamacare. The president is to speak on the need for reform at a small business event on Tuesday.

The new legislative push comes as Trump as revamped their White House staff, installing a telegenic new communications director in Wall Street savvy Anthony Scaramucci, who nevertheless has drawn headlines for their attacks on White House rivals.
Overseeing the new White House operation will be Gen. John Kelly, who spent four decades in the Marines but whose inclination for the complexities of tax policy tradeoffs is unknown.
Trump plans to call for a historic overhaul, Axios reported Monday.
The president, who was criticized for failing to do enough to try to build public support for the GOP's Obamacare repeal legislation, could take to the road with speeches in the industrial heartland in August, according to the report.
Their first stop is in Huntington, West Virginia, on Thursday.
The president's legislative affairs director, Marc Short, (left) seconded Mnuchin and said: 'It's not only something that we would like to do, it's something that we have to do this year'
A statement of principles that congressional Republicans and the White House released last week called for cutting individual corporate tax rates 'as much as possible.'
The principles also call for quicker depreciation of business assets.
House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady agreed to drop a border-adjusted tax in the agreement that they'd been pursing but other Republicans, including the activists at AFP, were opposing.
Short said the White House has been working 'very diligently' to make sure it's on the same page as legislators.
But the statement released was vague in many respects. It made no specific mentions of deductions to be eliminated, for example. A plan for a border adjustment tax got jettisoned, and didn't appear in the joint statement.

According to the principles, congressional committees will seek to 'make taxes simpler, fairer, and lower.'
'We have always been in agreement that tax relief for American families should be at the heart of our plan. We also believe there should be a lower tax rate for small businesses so they can compete with larger ones, and lower rates for all American businesses so they can compete with foreign ones. The goal is a plan that reduces tax rates as much as possible, allows unprecedented capital expensing, places a priority on permanence, and creates a system that encourages American companies to bring back jobs and profits trapped overseas.'
Lawmakers for years have searched for a way to simplify the tax code, slash corporate income tax rates, find a way to repatriate income being held overseas, and raise revenue by getting rid of deductions.
Trump told the Wall Street Journal last week that middle-income people have gotten 'screwed,' and that a goal was to put the tax burden on upper-income people.
IT CAN'T GO WORSE: Senator John McCain leaves the the Senate chamber at the U.S. Capitol after voting against their own party
"The truth is, the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed," the president said. "And if there's upward revision, it's going to be on high-income people,' they continued.
But a nonpartisan analysis by the Tax Policy Center reveals that the group getting hit the hardest by a plan as described by the president would be upper middle-class households earning between $150,000 and $300,000.
The study found that about 20 percent of households could see an increase, the Wall Street Journal reported. About a third of the 19 million households in that income range would see taxes rise by $3,000 to $4,000 a year.
In a departure from the leadership driven, secretive process that brought about healthcare legislation that imploded last week, the joint statement calls for 'regular order' on tax reform.
'Our expectation is for this legislation to move through the committees this fall, under regular order, followed by consideration on the House and Senate floors,' it says.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week that ending taxation of overseas corporate profits and moving to a 'territorial' system was a 'very, very, very high priority,' the Washington Examiner reported.
Despite its decision not to divest from fossil fuel companies, the University is embarking on a set of new initiatives aimed at reducing Yale's carbon footprint.
In a Wednesday email to the Yale community, University President Peter Salovey announced six initiatives intended to mitigate the University's greenhouse gas emissions. These include new Green Fellowships, increased deployment of renewable energy, school-specific sustainability plans, a $21 million capital investment for energy conservation, third-party verification of greenhouse gas emissions and the possibility of an internal carbon pricing mechanism. Though many students remain upset by the University's unwillingness to divest, students and faculty interviewed who are involved in environmental issues said they are excited by the new plans.
“I think that if [Yale administrators] actually follow through with reducing carbon emissions … that certainly is a good step in the right direction,” said Don Mosteller FES '15, who wrote a memo on sustainability at Yale that was sent to Salovey's office last spring.
Calling climate change “the most important issue that faces the world in our time,” Salovey told the News that the University is committed to reducing its impact on the environment.
Of the University's six initiatives, the possibility of an internal carbon pricing mechanism within Yale has generated the most discussion so far.
According to Salovey's email, a program such as an internal carbon pricing mechanism could provide incentives for units within Yale “to reduce their carbon footprint in a way that is not administratively or economically burdensome.”
To decide whether an internal carbon pricing system could be implemented at Yale, Salovey has appointed a committee — chaired by Professor William Nordhaus and called the Presidential Carbon Charge Task Force — to examine whether such a system could be established.
Nordhaus said the task force will begin its deliberations with an open mind about whether to create a system and, if so, what form that system will take.
School of Management professor Sharon Oster, who will serve on the task force, said an internal carbon tax would generally be designed to help administrators and faculty throughout Yale make decisions while taking the school's carbon footprint into account.
“The internal tax essentially replaces admonitions and rules with prices as a way to regulate behavior,” Oster said in an email. “Yale is a forward thinking university in many areas. Why not this one as well?”
Salovey noted in their email that the administration is unaware of any other university that has implemented an internal carbon tax. However a growing list of corporations and municipalities have introduced carbon pricing systems, including Microsoft, Disney and Google.
At Microsoft, all business groups are required to take a carbon fee into account when planning their budgets. This incentivizes groups to reduce their carbon emissions by increasing efficiency and using renewable resources, Microsoft has argued.
Jennifer Milikowsky FES '15, who proposed the carbon pricing system in a policy memo presented to Salovey's office, said that Yale could assert leadership by implementing such a system, a sentiment Salovey echoed in their email.
“I think it's a way to really use Yale as a case study to demonstrate how a carbon tax could be designed and implemented, and then study the effectiveness of it,” Milikowsky said.
Yale Law School professor Daniel Esty LAW '86 echoed Milikowsky's point, suggesting that the University can serve as a catalyst for action on climate change.
Calling the carbon pricing system “the very best way to address the problem of climate change,” Esty noted Yale's important role in developing policy frameworks that have applications well beyond its walls.
“The possibility of Yale implementing some sort of carbon charge represents a big breakthrough that could have repercussions well beyond the Yale campus and represents significant leadership,” Esty said.
Still, Mosteller noted that Nordhaus' committee can only make a recommendation. Ultimately, they said, it is up to the administration to follow through.
Nordhaus' committee will include students. On Thursday, the Yale College Council emailed the student body soliciting applications for spaces on the committee.
The potential carbon pricing mechanism comes together with five other proposals also targeted at reducing the University's carbon emissions. The University's current goal is to reduce greenhouse emissions by 43 percent by 2020 from 2005 levels. Thus far, it has reduced them by 16 percent.
“[The announcements] are pretty fantastic and ambitious steps,” said Melissa Goodall, the assistant director in Yale's Office of Sustainability.
The $21 million investment for energy conservation will put $7 million each year into capital projects to improve energy conservation across campus. Included in those funds will be an “Energy Solutions Fund,” totaling $100,000 per year, earmarked for student proposals focused on energy conservation.
The University will also install a 1.25-megawatt array of solar panels at West Campus, which will cover 350,000 square feet of roof. Once installed, the panels will help Yale avoid 500 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year.
Furthermore, Yale will become a member of the Climate Registry, a nonprofit aimed at increasing transparency about greenhouse gas emissions by putting them into a single online repository.
Registering will allow for third-party verification of Yale's disclosures on its greenhouse gas emissions. Salovey said they will ask other schools within the Ivy League to become members as well.
Salovey will also ask the Sustainability Advisory Council, chaired by Professors Brad Gentry and Michelle Addington, to evaluate whether Yale's sustainability goals are ambitious enough.
Still, members of Fossil Free Yale — which advocated that the University divest its assets from fossil fuel companies — said that the measures do not go far enough.
“It seems the actions are totally insufficient,” said Patrick Reed '16, a founding member of Fossil Free Yale. “It doesn't match up.”
At a candlelit vigil on Wednesday night, members of Fossil Free Yale resolved to continue pressing the University to eliminate its holdings in fossil fuel companies.
Divestment is “not an issue that's going to go away,” Mosteller said.
In October 2013, Salovey announced a new strategic plan on sustainability through 2016.

私はブログとフェイスブックに載せる記事を、原則として日本語と英語の２カ国語で書いている。
記事の題材や資料が英語の場合、先に英語で書いてから日本語に翻訳する。
この場合はあまり苦労を感じない。
しかし、参照する資料などが日本語だった場合、
先に日本語で記事を書いてから英語に翻訳する場合が多い。
このパターンは少々やっかいだ。
日本語は漢字という１種類の 表意文字と、ひらがなとカタカナという２種類の表音文字 を組み合わせて表記できる。
しかも、「助詞」をうまく使えば、日本語は文の中で語順を入れ替えることすら自由自在だ。
他方、英語はアルファベットという２６文字だけで全てを表現しなければならない。
便利な「助詞」は存在せず、倒置法などは限られる。
ちなみに、日本語の仮名は「五十音」と言われるが、「がざだば」行の濁音、「ぱ」行の半濁音、「ぁ」行と「っゃゅょゎ」 という捨て仮名を入れると、ひらがなは７６文字。カタカナは「ヴ」も使うから７７文字ある。
加えて、常用漢字は２１３６字／４３８８音訓もあり、同じ言葉でも、どの文字種を使うかで微妙に意味を変えられる。
従って、日本語で文章を書くときの自由度の高さは、英語とは比較にならない。
うまい皮肉を日本語で思い付いても、英語で表現しようとすると本当に大変なのだ。
世界に誇るべき日本語の表現力だが、
前回の連載で、君が代の変遷について書く際に、
日本の初代文部大臣の森有礼（ありのり） について調べていたら、驚くべき事実を知ってしまった。
森は１０代で英国に留学しており、英語が非常に堪能だった。
この日英バイリンガルの大先輩は
「日本語を廃止して、英語を日本の国語にすべきだ」と考えていた。漢字の複雑さを特に問題視していたようだ。
確かに、明治初期の漢字は今よりも複雑で数も多かった。話し言葉は口語、書き言葉は漢文という不自由な習慣もあった。
西洋に後れた政治や経済、科学などの学習に必要不可欠な英単語は、日本では概念すら存在しないものが多かった。
例えば、「社会」「存在」「自然」「権利」「自由」「個人」「品性」「人格」「情報」「近代」「美」「恋愛」「芸術」
「彼・彼女」などの言葉は、江戸時代の日本にはなかった。明治期の先人が苦労を重ねて生み出したのだ。
もし、これらの言葉が使えなかったら、日本語の文筆作業は相当もどかしい。
だから、当時の森の気持ちも理解できるが、 現代から見れば、満４１歳で暗殺された森の考えは若気の至りだった。
ところが、本当に漢字を廃止して、独自の表音文字だけにした国が、日本の近くに存在する。
結果、国民の大多数が、
わずか７０年前の書籍や新聞を全く読めず、
真実の歴史に向き合えない。
悲劇と呼ぶべきか、喜劇なのか。それが問題だ。

日本が世界でも一・ニを争う技術大国になれたのは、
表意文字と表音文字を併用した日本語に寄るトコロが大きいだろう。
外来語を素早く表音文字のカタカナで取り込み、
意味を把握したら表意文字の漢字で造語を創る。
初めて見るような単語でも漢字であれば、
単語の意味をイメージし易い。
技術書はちょっとハードルが高いが
http://www.nedo.go.jp/hyoukabu/articles/201312kogakugiken/index.html
↑このくらいの技術系ニュースは誰でも簡単に読み理解する事が出来る。
また、漢字の特徴の一つとして高い造語能力がある。
表意文字の漢字同士を組み合わせる事によって
未知の知識、西洋からの概念群(科学・哲学・技術・思想・社会・軍事・経済等すべての分野)
に対応する造語を造り出す事ができた。
もし、これらの造語創出が無かったら、
世界の多くの国が抱えている問題に日本も直面したことだろう。
それは、世界の多くの国では母国語で大学以上の高等教育を行っていない。
なぜなら、母国語では、高等教育における科学技術や
専門学等で使われる多量な学術用語が不足している為、
大学レベル以上の科学や技術、専門学等に使われる教科書は
英語やフランス語、ドイツ語等の外国の教科書に頼らざるを得ない。
(韓国の理系教科の高等教育は英語です)
海外から入ってくる言葉を片っ端から母国語にして、
そして、全て母国語で思考する。
コレは、新概念を理解し、創造性の拡張にとって有利です。

日本語による全脳活動
「右脳の優れている点」
図形などを読み取る能力。
音楽などを聞き取る能力。
全体を見る力。直観力。
「左脳の優れている点」
言語の読み取り能力。
言語の聞き取り能力。
分析力。思考力。
世界中の人々は、表音文字の読み取りの時、左脳の方がよく働きます。
日本人も表音文字の平仮名＆片仮名の読み取りの時は、左脳の方がよく働きます。
しかし、表意文字の漢字の読み取りについては、
一字一字の漢字を読み取る時、右脳の方がよく働いているのです。
漢字は意味を持った図形だからでしょう。
そして、表音文字の平仮名＆片仮名と表意文字の漢字の混ざった文章の読み取りになると
左脳と右脳が共に働く状態になります。
漢字＆片仮名＆平仮名の文章を読む行為は、
右脳と左脳を共働させるという効果があるのです。
右脳と左脳を共働状態に置く事によって、
脳の持つ能力が最大限に発揮出来るのです。
この全脳活動は、文章を読む時、
新概念のより早い理解や創造性の拡張に役立っているのです。
1982年5月、イギリスの科学専門誌「ネイチャー」に
心理学者リチャード・リン博士の論文が発表され、
それは世界中に大きなセンセーションを巻き起しました。
その論文とはリン博士を中心とする
世界の先進トップ5ヶ国「日・英・米・仏・西独」の学者達が協力して、
それまでにない大規模な知能テストを行い、
それぞれの国の子供達の知能検査を比較したのですが、その結果は、
「日本を除く欧米4か国の子供達の平均IQが100以下だったのに対し、
日本の子供達の平均IQだけが111もあった」という学者達にとって予想外な結果でした。
平均IQ差に11点以上もの開きがあるというのは大変な事です。
また、リン博士は「知能指数が130を超える人は、
欧米では２％未満なのに対し、日本では10％にも達する。
日本の約8割(77％)の人のIQは、米国人の平均IQより高い」などと指摘しました。
世界中(特に欧米)がこれを問題にしたのは当然でした。
中には「テストの実施に何か手落ちがあった為ではないか」という懐疑的な意見もありましたが、
多くの学者はこの事実を素直に認め、
日本の子供達の知能が何故これ程までに高いのか？
その原因究明に真剣に取組みました。
その結果、欧米の学者達の大方の意見は
「漢字の学習がその原因になっているのではないか」というものでした。
日本人には欧米人には無い
漢字脳という特別な脳領域があるのです。
この漢字脳の有無が
日本人の平均IQと欧米人の平均IQの
歴然とした優劣差になって現れるのです。
(漢字文化圏は平均IQ105以上で世界で最も平均知能指数が高い地帯である)

第二次大戦後、GHQの占領政策の一つに、
漢字、平仮名、片仮名を廃止して、
日本語を全てローマ字表記にしようとする政策がありました。
この政策は途中で中止になりましたが、
もし、漢字、平仮名、片仮名を取り上げられていたら
今日の様な世界の先頭を走る高度な技術発展は
まず望め無かったただろうし、
資源の無い日本は世界有数の最貧国になっていたかもしれません。
新概念のより早い理解や創造性の拡張には、
母国語で思考する事が大切です。
もし、日本の大学の物理科学技術等の教科書が
英語や若しくはローマ字表記の日本語で書かれていたら、
この分野で日本からノーベル賞受賞者が出る事は、まず無かっただろう。
見て意味が解る表意文字。
読まないと意味が解らない表音文字。
表意文字は読解力に有利です。
(例えばこのレスが漢字無しの平仮名片仮名だけで書かれていたら十倍以上の読解差が出る事だろう)
外国の科学・工学・技術等の語彙を全て表意文字の漢字に魔変換する事で、
表音文字オンリーの国々に対しアドバンテージを持つ。
日本が世界最先端の技術大国の地位を保つ必要条件だ。
特に、日本が今現在出遅れているIT産業と金融産業。
この分野の表音文字を表意文字に魔変換させる造語創出が待望されます。

グローバル化=英語化≠産業発展？
フィリピンなどは、長年、公用語に英語を使用しているが、
英語が絶滅的な日本と比べるまでもなく、
他の東南アジア諸国と比べても産業が発展してるとは言い難い。
例え日本人が学習によって英語を習得出来たとしても、
代々、歴史、伝統、風土、習俗、文化、宗教、日常的に英語を培って来た本家の英米には、
英語を使っての産業では永遠に適わないだろう。
外国語で思考する事で、
日本の科学技術産業の競争力低下は避けられません。日本のフィリピン化です。
グローバル化=英語化≠産業発展？？？
一石二鳥で、英米にとっては望ましい事だろうけど。
近頃の日本は、外国語を魔変換せず、
そのままのローマ字表記やカタカナ表記で止めてしまう事が多くなって来ています。
日本が外国語を表意文字の漢字に魔変換せず、
カタカナまでで止めてしまうのは、
他の表音文字オンリーの国々と同列となり、
技術立国の日本の弱体化に繋がるのではないかと危惧しています。
少なくとも科学技術産業分野での漢字表記の重要性を顧慮すべきです。
五万語ある漢字による組合せで魔変換出来ない世界の文字言語は無いだろう。
コレにより科学技術伝承の一方通行が出来る可能性があります。
(他国が漢字表記の専門造語を変換出来なくなる可能性)
この文字言語障壁で、日本の科学・技術の世界流出拡散が抑制されます。
【日本語の優位性】その６
日本語は読み手にとって優しい言語である。
同じ内容分量の速読では日本語が圧倒的に勝る。
(文字の瞬間認識において、漢字は世界最高という研究結果も出ている)
しかも外来語はカタカナを使えばそれと直ぐ解る。
非常に優れた文字言語である事を当の日本人が理解していないのは残念。
造語力の高い漢字と外来語を即日本語にしてしまう片仮名。
世界の文学書を読みたければ日本語を覚えろと言われたりします。
なぜなら日本語ほど他国の文学書が翻訳されてる言語はないからです。
日本が技術超大国の地位を維持するには、
小中学校で英語やダンスの授業よりも、
好きな本を読ませる「読書」「速読」の授業や
暗算で3桁までの四則演算が出来るよう「算盤」に力を入れるべきだな。
算盤式暗算は右脳開発にも効果があるからな。
今の日本社会では漢字をドンドン削減し替わりに日本人に英語を与え
欧米にとってフェアな競争環境を作ろうという機運が盛り上がってます。
日本人の英語が幾ら達者になっても仮にフィリピン人よりも英語が達者になったとしても
欧米にとっては脅威に成りません。
それよりも日本人が漢字学習でドンドンiQを高め、
欧米が太刀打ち出来なくなるほど差を付けて来る方が脅威なのです。
GHQの日本統治以降、日本のマスメディアは米国のプロパガンダ機関です。情報は支配されています。
米国にとって脅威に成り得る「漢字学習はiQを高められる」という情報は伏せられ、
替わりに「日本人のiQが高いのは魚をよく食べるから」とか「過酷な受験戦争があるから」などの情報が流されます。
日本人の知能指数をドンドン堕とされ
お馬鹿な家畜にされないよう気を付けて下さい。

Solar Tax Credits, Incentives and Solar Rebates in Florida Latest Update: by
by Simone Garneau
Solar Energy Outlook
Summary Data for FL State Capital Tallahassee Solar Value Index $866 Solar Energy Produced 7,287 kWh / year Average retail electricity price (as of December 2017) 11.89 cents / kWh Average annual consumption per household (2015 data) 13,695 kWh Levelized Cost of Solar Electricity 7.68 cents / kWh Reached grid parity? Yes
The Sunshine State sounds like the perfect place for solar energy. However, the reality is very different. Florida runs on natural gas, and lots of it. After Texas, Florida is the second state in the U.S. (after Texas) in the share of natural gas in the electricity mix. Almost two thirds of the electricity supply comes from natural-gas fired turbines. Coal, nuclear energy and small amounts of renewables contribute the rest. But not all is lost when it comes to solar energy, as the state enjoys abundant sunshine and the existing solar incentives help to make solar power more affordable.
At 11.89 cents/ kWh, the electricity prices in the state are below the national average of 12.81 cents / kWh. When it comes to average electricity consumption per household, residents of this state consume 13,695 kWh per year, above the national average of 10,836 kWh.
Currently, Florida has 13 financial incentive programs and 13 regulatory programs supporting the adoption of solar energy. Unfortunately, Florida does not offer a state income tax credit.
Florida is a grid parity state, making solar power cheaper than the residential utility rates. Especially when used in combination with the 30% federal solar tax credit, the incentives listed below can significantly reduce the cost of installation of solar panels for your home or business.

BY TROY MASTERS | Los Angeles, like nearly every major urban center in America, is facing a growth conundrum: a staggering rise in the numbers of homeless people living in the streets coupled with massive inflation in rents, some say driven up by artificially inflated Real Estate values. Others, however, say the inflation in both rent and Real Estate value has been caused by too little housing inventory.
- Advertisement -
One popular solution? Build. But slow-growth advocates want limits.
The clash has resulted in a very expensive battle in the form of two ballot initiatives, Measure H and Measure S, playing out over the airwaves, online and town halls across Los Angeles.
Measure H, if approved, would increase the sales tax one-fourth of a cent and the proceeds would be used to fund a variety of programs for economically challenged city residents, including mental health services, substance abuse treatment, health care, education, job training, and affordable housing. It would raise about $355 million a year.
Measure S, Changes to Laws Governing the General Plan and Development, or Neighborhood Integrity Inititiative, would change the way zoning rules are used to allow construction projects to move forward, which some say would contradict or obstruct aspects of Measure H, possibly promoting a “Not In My Back Yard” attitude.
Currently, in Los Angeles, if a real estate developer wishes to build a project that exceeds current zoning rules — the 240 foot luxury residential tower that shopping mall developer Rick Caruso wants to erect next to the Beverly Center, for example — City Council members are petitioned to make an exception to zoning regulations that would allow the building to be developed.
Activists allege that money or other favors change hands in backroom deals with both community leaders and City Councilmembers, resulting in exceptions — or spot zoning — that allows projects of every kind to move forward. They argue that the vast majority of such projects are housing for high-income earners and that the projects exacerbate the housing affordability crisis.
Pro-Growth advocates and real estate developers argue that such a crisis is properly addressed by the construction of more housing units at all economic levels. In exchange, some developers have agreed to make available a small percentage of residential units for tenants earning very low and moderate incomes, similar to “Section 8” housing programs. In the example of the Caruso project, 13 of the 145 luxury apartments will be made available to such tenants.
In New York City such concessions are required by law and in one famous instance resulted in the “rich door, poor door” solution, that resulted in a scandal over separation of classes.
Community activist Tim Deegan, a long-time resident and community leader in THE Miracle Mile neighborhood, says “Measure S asks for a two-year moratorium on spot zoning, to give the City Council a good start on its long delayed updating of the City's General Plan. Measure S does not call for a halt to all construction, it affects only 5%” of all projects currently planned.
Proponents of the initiative claim that 95 percent of building permits and projects already in the pipeline do not seek spot zoning exemptions and would be unaffected by Measure S.
One overlooked and potentially beneficial aspect of Measure S it that it seeks to change the way building projects are studied prior to approval. Developers, for instance, currently offer or provide their own Environmental Impact Reports (EIR). Measure S would require that The EIR be managed by independent third party experts.
Mayor Eric Garcetti, an opponent of Measure S, says the initiative would “undermine efforts to house the homeless, such as the measure voters passed in November.” Garcetti is referring to the $1.2 billion bond initiative, Measure HHH, which passed in November 2016 with 77 percent voter support. “We won't be able to spend the money that voters authorized,” for homeless housing, Garcetti said. “We won't be able to find the sites.”
However, projects that do not require changes to Los Angeles' General Plan can proceed. But Garcetti says the existing General Plan is so outdated (many areas are not zoned for apartments or homes) some Measure H projects involving affordable housing may not qualify for exemption if Measure S passes.
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has voted to oppose Measure S. Councilman Jose Huizar, chairperson of the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, says they hope updating the General Plan will “help alleviate some of the concerns about Measure S, which is not to do as many general plan amendments, not to do as many zone changes as we have in the past.”
There's another component to the clash: building also means jobs. Opponents claim Measure S would push construction workers into unemployment and cite the need for an up-to-date community plan.
But Measure S supporters aren't buying it. “The city, unfortunately, has a track record of saying they're going to fix something, having a hearing, backing the reform and then it doesn't happen,” Jill Stewart, campaign manager for Yes on S told the LA Times. “Because of their disastrous track record, there's a lack of trust that any of this is going to happen.”
Measure S, bankrolled in part by AIDS Healthcare Foundation, disputes that homeless housing projects are threatened by Measure S.
The primary opposition to Measure S is being bankrolled by a developer but the initiative has several other opponents, as well. The Los Angeles LGBT Center says Measure H is an important issue for the LGBT community since homelessness in Los Angeles County disproportionately impacts LGBT youth. The Center add that Measure S would also impact LGBT seniors and transgender people disproportionately due to higher levels of poverty.
Election day is Tuesday, March 7 . Deadline to register to vote is this Wednesday, February 22 .
Mutton makeover: Dry-aged meat back in fashion and on menus in Australian revival
Updated
Australian mutton is making a comeback thanks to a surge in demand from restaurateurs.
For years mutton has been seen by many as inferior to lamb, but dry-ageing mature sheep meat could change that.
A recent trial funded by Meat and Livestock Australia found dry-aged mutton out performed standard wet aged lamb in a taste test.
While dry-aged lamb scored the highest, South Australian producer, processor and restaurateur Tim Burvill, who ran the trial, said it was a significant finding.
"It shows that there's a significant upside in being able to value-add to perceived lower-grade products like hogget and mutton," Mr Burvill said.
Dry-ageing occurs when meat is stored in low humidity near freezing conditions for several weeks to improve tenderness and flavour.
Most meat these days is not aged this way — instead it goes straight into vacuum-sealed bags in what is known as wet ageing.
Mr Burvill has been one of the biggest advocates of bringing back the traditional technique, setting up a dry-ageing facility in the Adelaide Hills.
For the past five years the cattle producer has focused on dry-ageing beef, which they supply to their Adelaide restaurant A Hereford Beefstouw.
But Mr Burvill said there was great potential in sheep too.
"What we found was the dry-aged sheep meat products were all higher in the positive attributes and lower in negative attributes, particularly things like the metallic and livery characteristics that you can sometimes see in wet aged lamb," they said.
Mutton meat a 'niche' product
One disadvantage of dry-ageing is the meat shrinks and more of the surface needs trimming.
Producers are concerned with sheep being smaller than cattle, the yield loss will be too great for the process to be viable.
What is dry-aged mutton? Mutton is meat from a sheep that is older than a year. It is an intense red colour and contains a considerable amount of fat
Dry-ageing is a centuries-old technique of improving the flavour and texture by hanging it on the bone for up to 120 days
But Mr Burvill said while yield losses in the trial were about 5 per cent higher than in beef, it was still worth their time.
"You will never see dry-aged product down at your local pub for a $10 meal — it will always be a high-end niche product," they said.
"But there is little doubt in my mind that this is a viable product."
Australia is the largest exporter of mutton in the world, with 95 per cent of what is produced heading offshore, mainly to the Middle East and China, at prices well below what lamb fetches.
"We believe that if just 10 per cent of that mutton and hogget could be dry-aged that would add approximately $3.5 million per annum to the Australian industry," Meat and Livestock Australia's Sean Starling said.
"Adoption now is key. It would be a shame that if all this work was done that no producer or processing company or retailer or food service adopted this know-how."
Mutton shakes off wartime bad reputation
WA mixed farmer David Thompson was ahead of the game before the trials started.
The Moojepin Merino Meat sheep producer said while the memory of poor-quality mutton during war times left a bad taste in the mouths of many, older sheep meat is slowly shaking the stigma.
"Three years ago I was on a flight across to Dubai," Mr Thompson said.
"I could hear the hostesses saying 'would you like the chicken or the mutton', and people would say 'yes I'd like the mutton'."
"It was sort of like a light bulb moment that mutton is not such a bad name."
They said most of the sheep sent off were about five years old.
"The oldest we've done is 10 years of age, which farmers find quite humorous, but it's a different market when you're talking to the food market," they said.
"They're quite happy to have a 3,000-day grazed animal."
The biggest challenge for Mr Thompson has been finding a processor willing to hang the meat for 21 days.
"I've been told you will never succeed doing this because it's just not worth doing," they said.
But the farmer known as the "mutton man" in restaurant circles is persisting.
And while turning it into a sustainable business is still a work in progress, they said there was good money in older meat.
"We get a good price for it," Mr Thompson said.
"But the most exciting thing is when you go to a restaurant and you see your product and you think you've made it.
"That's probably the highlight of my farming life I reckon."

But despite the excitement, when you look at poll aggregators -- organizations that take a look at the available polls and average them together -- the race has been remarkable steady, with Clinton maintaining a pretty constant edge over Trump over the course of the year. You can see an example of this in a chart from Pollster, below.
But are the polls reliable? How should average voters understand polls and use them to understand the election? For answers to these questions, I turned to Dr. Sam Wang. Dr. Wang is a physicist, but they also manage the Princeton Election Consortium, which takes data from polling organizations across the country to build a statistical model of election outcomes, and has been doing so since 2004. Here are a few tidbits you can take out of the conversation to understand polls as we near the end of the election.
Individual Polls Are Often Incorrect, But The Combination Of Polls Is Reliable
The nature of polling means that any given poll is going to be off by at least a little bit, just given the math, Wang explained to me.
"If you sample say, 800 people in a race that's really 50-50 and trying to get a feel for what voters will do, it's like tossing a coin 800 times," Wang said. "If coin is fair you'll get about 400 heads and 400 tails. But it'd be surprising to get exactly that. You'll likely get something like 390 heads and 410 tails. It's impossible to get within better than a few percentage points, because you can't interview everybody."
Another aspect of the sampling, too, is that pollsters have to apply their professional judgement. Since different demographic groups have different likelihoods of answering the phone, and that likelihood is different than how likely they are to vote, pollsters have to apply judgement and math to get a good snapshot of the electorate.
"They're all working to get honest results but they're applying their own judgement," says Wang.
By the same token, though, the aggregate of polls can be pretty close to the real result. To continue with the coin flipping metaphor, if you have three different sets of coin tosses that resulted in 395 heads, 405 heads and 398 heads, the median result there are 398 heads -- pretty close to the actual result of 400 in terms of the coin flip odds, and closer than the two outliers.
So the key for predicting election results is to look at multiple polls for the same area and take the median value. That said, it's important to take the median, which is the middle value of a set of numbers, and not the average -- which gives much heavier weight to outliers.
"For example, right now in Michigan there are a handful of recent polls that show Clinton ahead by a few points," said Wang. "But there's one that shows them leading by 20 points -- that's way off. If you take the median of all the polls, you have Clinton ahead by a few points, but if you average them, it shows a bigger lead than they likely has."
Pay More Attention To State Polls Than National Polls, Because The Latter Can Have Wilder Swings
Another thing that Wang cautions voters paying attention to the election about is national polls. That's both because presidential elections are decided by the electoral college, and also because national polls can produce a lot of wild swings just by their nature. For example, three days ago an ABC-Washington Post poll garnered a lot of attention on social media because a few days earlier the same tracking poll had showed Clinton with a 6-point lead. (The same poll today gives Secretary Clinton a 3-point lead.)
"About 1 in 20 times you'll get a swing like that," said Wang. "With about 20 organizations running polls, you'll see an outlier every day -- and outliers tend to get more attention."
Because of this, Wang encourages voters who want to stay informed to the median of poll results in a few key states rather than national polling. "A few key states are absolutely necessary for Trump. If they don't win those it's over."
A Swing Towards Trump Right Now Isn't Momentum -- It's "Regression To The Mean"
Over the past few days, there have been a few reports showing that in the aggregate, Mr. Trump has gained 2-3 percentage points of support in the election. For supporters of Mr. Trump, this has been seen as a sign of "momentum" for them to overtake Secretary Clinton on Tuesday. But Wang urges caution for both Trump and Clinton supporters interpreting this swing.
"One thing that's been apparent is that a major feature of voter opinion for last five elections -- this is the sixth -- is that voters have become entrenched," says Wang. "The movement of voter opinion has been within a narrow range. In finance and other types of statistical analysis, we call this kind of movement a 'regression to the mean.' It happened in 2008, in 2012 and it's happening this year. When things go too far in one direction, they'll start to head back to a midpoint. Clinton is now at the low end of where she's been this season. But if the regression to the mean holds, we should see a little movement back to Clinton. But we'll see."
The Brexit Vote Results Were A Pundit Failure, Not A Polling Failure
The specter of Britain's vote to exit the European Union in June has cast some uncertainty on this election, particularly when it comes to the reliability of polling. But there are a few reasons why Britain's "Leave" vote shouldn't color our thinking about the presidential election, says Wang.
"If you look at Brexit coverage, it was really pundit failure," says Wang. "Commentators were saying there was no possible way for Leave to win. But if you look at the data -- and I did this the day before -- it showed Remain as only very slightly ahead. I said then it was too close to call and could go either way. That's what the data was saying. It's not data's fault that pundits said Remain was going to win."
The other thing to consider, says Wang, is that Brexit was a one-off event, but there is a lot of experience when it comes to polling U.S. presidential elections.
"Presidential state polls are the gold standard of polling data around the world," Wang said. "U.S. pollsters are constantly experimenting with new methods. I'd be very surprised if there's a community-wide error of more than 1-2 points."
The Hardest Elections To Predict In 2016 Are For Senate Seats, Not President
While it's not over until it's over, Wang notes that Hillary Clinton is "heavily favored to win" the presidential election. What's really interesting, they said, are Senate elections, which are very close and leave the question of which party will control the Senate in 2017 very much up in the air.
"Six Senate races are within one percentage point," they said. "If I were a voter I'd be paying attention to the Senate."

A military vehicle carries what is believed to be a Taepodong-class missile Intermediary Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) during a military parade in Pyongyang on April 15, 2012. North Korea has warned of retaliation after the US scrapped food aid over its rocket launch, raising fears of a new nuclear test, as China reportedly suspended a refugee deal with its wayward ally
North Korea has warned of retaliation after the US scrapped food aid over its rocket launch, raising fears of a new nuclear test, as China reportedly suspended a refugee deal with its wayward ally.
In a defiant statement late Tuesday, the nuclear-armed North said it was no longer bound by a bilateral agreement to halt testing of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles after Washington suspended much-needed food aid.
"We have thus become able to take necessary retaliatory measures, free from the agreement," its foreign ministry said, accusing Washington of hostile acts.
South Korean analysts said they expect the North to follow up by staging a third nuclear weapons test, or launching another long-range missile.
The North also rejected condemnation by the United Nations Security Council, including its ally China, of the failed launch last Friday.
Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper said Wednesday that China has suspended the refugee repatriation deal because it was not consulted about the launch, seen by the US and its allies as a covert test of ballistic missile technology.
The paper quoted two Chinese officials as saying the long-standing policy of swiftly returning North Koreans as economic migrants -- despite the punishment they face back home -- had been put on hold.
The suspension reflects Beijing's displeasure with its troublesome neighbour which "did not show the necessary attention to its friend China," it quoted one unidentified official as saying.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Liu Weimin declined comment on the report but called for calm.
"We hope relevant parties will exercise calm and restraint, maintain engagement and dialogue and continue to uphold the denuclearisation process on the Korean peninsula," Liu said.
Pyongyang insists its botched satellite launch was not a missile test and did not breach the February deal with Washington, under which it vowed to suspend uranium enrichment and nuclear and missile tests in return for food.
But the US called off plans to start shipping 240,000 tonnes of food, saying the North could no longer be trusted.
On Monday a Security Council presidential statement "strongly condemned" the launch. It ordered a tightening of existing sanctions and warned of new action if the isolated state stages another nuclear or long-range missile test.
South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak Wednesday praised China's response to the launch, including its backing for the UN statement.
"I believe we can trust China... we should continue to manage relations with it," they were quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying.
But Pyongyang said Washington had imposed a "brigandish demand" on other Security Council members. "Nothing can stand in the way of (North Korea's) space development for peaceful purposes," it vowed.
The launch was to have been the centrepiece of mass celebrations marking the centenary of the birth of founding president Kim Il-Sung, grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-Un.
Shrugging off the failure, the North wheeled out an apparently new long-range missile at a major military parade Sunday.
The North staged atomic weapons tests months after its long-range rocket launches in 2006 and 2009.
"With the February agreement broken down in practice, the North will likely take many of the steps the US and South Korea have long feared, including another nuclear test and a long-range missile test," said Paik Hak-Soon of the South's Sejong Institute think-tank.
When the United States and the Security Council start taking punitive actions, "Pyongyang will certainly respond with actions as well", said Yang Moo-Jin of Seoul's University of North Korean Studies.
"These would include a third nuclear test, or test-launching of an inter-continental ballistic missile or stepping up activities involving weapons-grade uranium," Yang said.
Donald Trump seemed to acknowledge that humans contribute to climate change Tuesday in a meeting with New York Times reporters, moving closer to widely held scientific opinion but away from the Republican Party line.
Donald Trump, after stating that they were going to reinstate waterboarding "and worse" for terrorists, now says they are against waterboarding. They also say global warming, which they once said was a hoax created by the Chinese to make U.S. manufacturing uncompetitive, may be caused by human-made activities.
 They are keeping an "open mind" when it comes to climate issues, they said. "I think there is some connectivity" between human activity and climate change, Trump said[.]
There is no way any person who is informed about the "theory" of global warming can believe that. The theory of global warming is that human-produced carbon dioxide traps heat in the atmosphere. But human-produced CO2 is only 3% of all CO2 (most is produced naturally), which in turn is only 3% of all the chemicals in the atmosphere. Common sense would tell anyone that human CO2 production has no bearing on so-called global warming.
It's sad that Donald Trump believes this, and worrisome. Will they reverse Obama's Clean Power Plan rule, which is shutting down important power plants because of the myth of CO2 production?
As for the "climate change" treaty Obama agreed to in Paris, Trump said:
On climate change, they refused to repeat their promise to abandon the international climate accord reached last year in Paris, saying that, "I'm looking at it very closely." But they said "I have an open mind to it[.]"
An open mind to it? To locking the U.S. into mandatory CO2 reductions, which, like Obama's Clean Power Plan, will also shut down power plants, make electricity much more expensive, and kill jobs?
On waterboarding:
Mr. Trump suggested they have changed their mind about the usefulness of waterboarding and other forms of torture after talking with James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, who headed the United States Central Command. "He said, 'I've never found it to be useful,'" Mr. Trump said, describing the general's view of torturing terrorism suspects. They added that Mr. Mattis found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terror suspects: "'Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I'll do better.'" They added: "I was very impressed by that answer.''
Again, common sense would dictate that hardened terrorists are not going to be swayed by cigarettes and beers. Do you think Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, would have confessed over a friendly beer? Sometimes harsher measures are necessary.
Again, it is worrisome how quickly Trump has changed often repeated positions even before they have taken office. It feels as though they are taking advice from the most recent person they speak to, and that their mind is easily changeable.
These are not minor issues, but issues that they spoke out about with force and specificity on the campaign trail. We can only hope that on the most important issues of immigration, border security, and the Supreme Court, Trump does not prove to be so malleable.

İsmail Ufak was heavily wounded by rocket fire on April 24 and taken to Kilis State Hospital, where they succumbed to their injuries on May 2.
Previously, seven people in Kilis were wounded by rockets fired from ISIL-held territory in Syria early on May 1.
Turkey has been hit by a series of rocket attacks originating from an ISIL-held region in Syria since mid-January.
A total of 19 people, including seven Syrians, have been killed by rocket fired at the border province since Jan. 18.
One person who was wounded in the southeastern border province of Kilis by rocket fire originating from an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)-held region in northern Syria died on May 2, increasing the death toll from similar incidents targeting the province since January to 19.
Risotto is a popular dish in our house. It's creamy, it's warming, it involves a bottle of wine to drink while you slowly stir the rice. And since it takes on flavors so well, it has endless possibilities for how it's prepared. Since traditional way is labor intensive, I found a way to Pressure Cook Risotto and get the same results in much less time
The Traditional Way to Cook Risotto
Risotto is really as much a method as it is a finished product. Cooking risotto in the traditional way will involve at least 20 minutes of slow and steady stirring. Unless you either work in a laboratory and have access to a magnetic stirrer or have an eager 9 year old, you'll probably be standing in front of your stove for a while.
As far as the technique goes, nearly every traditional risotto recipe will start the same way. Cook the onions (and garlic) in butter (or oil) until they're just translucent and then add the arborio rice so that it becomes lightly toasted. You'll notice the nutty smell coming off the pan. And then slowly stir in flavorful stock until the liquid is fully absorbed
For some extra flavor, I like to start with pancetta instead of butter. Cooking a few pieces of pancetta will leave a nice amount of pork fat in your saucepan. Depending on how much is left, I'll supplement with Olive Oil so that there's about 2 tablespoons worth left behind, and then add the onions. You'll save the pancetta and reintroduce it at the end.
After the grains have toasted a bit, and before adding the stock, I like to add in a bit of white wine. Not a lot, maybe half a glass or so. And it can't be that half empty bottle that you've had in the back of the fridge since for the past who knows how many weeks. The general rule for cooking wine is: If you wouldn't serve a glass of the wine to a guest, then by no means should you cook with it. And as a bonus, you now have a nearly full bottle of white wine to keep you entertained while you stir.
In the pot, the wine will reduce, intensify in flavor and be absorbed into the rice. All good things.
Next you'll start the process of adding small amounts of warm stock to the rice and stirring until it's fully absorbed. This action ensures the stock is absorbed uniformly and will also help the rice release as much of its starchy goodness as possible. This is what gives risotto the wonderful, creamy texture. Near the end is usually when I add in all of the extras.
End to end, it's probably about a 45 minute exercise.
The Modernist Cuisine Risotto Technique
Most of the recipes in the Modernist Cuisine at Home (MCAH) book either introduce time saving techniques or take you in an extreme direction to produce the absolute best possible dish. Their risotto recipe was a bit of a letdown as it didn't really save any time (actually took longer), was more cumbersome and wasn't really the best risotto I've ever had.
The MCAH recipe is a variation on a popular restaurant technique for cooking risotto at scale. If you think about it, a line cook can't exactly be spending 30 minutes stirring a pot and still expect to get other orders out. The premise is that you par-cook the grains, refrigerate them on a sheetpan and then finish cooking them later. The refrigeration on a frozen sheetpan is supposed to help with the starch release so that the finishing time is shortened.
So you start cooking in one pan, drain the rice through a cheesecloth to get out the excess liquid, spread is all out on a sheetpan for refrigeration and then put it all back into the pan to finish.
And were I making risotto for 50 guests, ordering it at 25 different times, it'd probably work beautifully. Doing it for 2, not so much.
Using a Pressure Cooker or an Instant Pot to make Risotto
So here is where I landed by creating not only a great risotto….but I also saved some time and effort in the process. And it wasn't nearly as laborious as the other ways.
If you pressure cook risotto, you basically cut the time by a third and eliminate the need to constantly stir the rice. If you're thinking about buying a pressure cooker, check out my handy pressure cooker buying guide. You can also make Instant Pot Risotto as well using the Pressure setting.
The rest of the recipe is pretty much identical. I started out with the pancetta in a little bit of olive oil over medium high until it was cooked on both sides. If you have a stainless steel pressure cooker, and aren't used to cooking in stainless steel, you might be fretting over having quite a mess in the bottom of the pot.
Don't worry, this will all quickly clean up once the onions go in. The onions, and later the white wine, will deglaze the pan beautifully and pull up all of the delicious fond that's accumulated.
When you add the stock, instead of going in 1/2 a cup at a time, you'll add it all and start to pressure cook the risotto.
After a quick release, add in your other ingredients and you're all set.
Working on a film about Emmett Till, the African American teen brutally slain in 1955, had already been an emotional experience for Kevin Wilson Jr.
A graduate film student at New York University, Wilson set out to document Till's life earlier this year, speaking with one of Till's cousins who was there 61 years ago when the 14-year-old was abducted, mutilated and dumped in Mississippi's Tallahatchie River.
Wilson said the interview left them shaken.
[White high schoolers in Mississippi put a noose around a black student's neck and ‘yanked,' NAACP says]
“I'm struggling to keep it together,” they wrote in a post on the film's fundraising page over the summer. “To be able to hear the voice of someone who shared laughs, cries, food, and a bed with Emmett Till is quite emotional.”
Wilson's research led them to another unsettling encounter last week.
As they were scouting locations for their project, they visited a memorial marker near the site where Till's severely beaten body was removed from the river. The purple sign describing the incident was riddled with dozens of bullet holes.
Wilson snapped a picture and posted it to Facebook.
“Clear evidence that we've still got a long way to go,” they wrote.
With racial tensions running high in the country, the post struck a chord. It has since been shared more than 13,000 times.
The fact that Emmett Till's memorial sign was shot up is so evil & depressing, I can't even wrap my head around it. — Kumail Nanjiani (@kumailn) October 22, 2016
Wish I could say I was surprised by #EmmettTill's memorial being vandalized. This is America's truth #50Shots: A msg of hate still resonates — Tee Marie Hanible (@TheRealTeeMarie) October 22, 2016
Till, a Chicago native, was visiting relatives in Money, Miss., in August 1955, when they spoke and interacted with a white female grocery store clerk. Later, the woman's husband and another man allegedly went to the house where Till was staying and abducted him, beating them severely and throwing them in the river with a cotton gin fan weighing them down.
When their body was discovered days later, Till's mother insisted on an open-casket funeral. Thousands of people attended, and gruesome photographs of their disfigured body were published in newspapers and magazines around the country. Their death and their alleged killers' trial — Roy Bryant, the woman's husband, and J.W. Milam were acquitted of all charges by an all-white jury — became a rallying cry for civil rights leaders.
Till's casket is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture.
The sign that marks the spot where Till's body was discovered has been stolen and vandalized on several occasions since it first went up in 2008, according to the Clarion-Ledger. The Emmett Till Memorial Commission installed eight markers like it around the county, and the sign near the river has seen the most damage.
“These are easy targets, a low-risk outlet for racism,” Dave Tell, an associate professor at the University of Kansas who is part of the Emmett Till Memory Project, told the Clarion-Ledger. Some people, they said, see “civil rights monuments as a form of reverse discrimination, a threat to their own well-being.”
People posted photos of the sign after it was vandalized in previous years.

So somebody shot up the marker where Emmett Till's body was found. 30 bulletholes: pic.twitter.com/4dz5uekUlz — Christopher Hooks (@cd_hooks) December 28, 2013
The Emmett Till Interpretive Center told WJTV that it has replaced damaged signs over the years, but the costs are beginning to mount. Police have yet to make any arrests in connection with the vandalism, WJTV reported.
A fundraiser to replace the sign passed its $15,000 goal Sunday night, raising more than $18,000.
Wilson said they didn't feel any danger when they first came across the sign during their scouting trip — only an “immense sadness” at seeing the bullet holes.
“It just kind of spoke to the racial climate in this country, not just in the area,” they told WJTV. “There are still people who are living in those areas who still hold those ideologies dear to their heart — ideologies that we're trying to get away from.”
In a disturbing contrast, Wilson also visited the site marker near the home of J.W. Milam, one of the two white men acquitted by an all-white jury of all charges related to Till's slaying. That sign, they said, appears perfectly intact.
“It is preserved and adorned with flowers,” Wilson said. “We have a long way to go.”
There are still many things we don't know about our bodies, so in some cases it's hard to say what makes us healthy or unhealthy. Still, it's obvious that despite a good diet, and exercising and that kind of things, there are other factors which have to be taken into consideration. In fact, recent studies have made it clear that there has to be a balance between the body and the soul are at harmony. The five principles necesary to obtain this harmony are written below, and they are not as hard as you would expect.
1. Regenerate by sleeping
Photo by animefx
This is the first and most natural way of regenerating your energy and mantaining a mental balance, and it is the best way to help the body be prepared. Nowadays we sleep a whole lot less than ancient times; since the discovery of the light bulb, the time alocated to sleep has grown smaller and smaller. Among the effects of a long period of time with insufficient sleep are high amounts of sugar in the bloodstream, high arterial tension, higher colesterol level, neurosis and a general state of discomfort.
2. Use stress towards your advantage
Stress is one of the things that causes most damage to us, due to the constant go-go and insecurities, among others. Still, what if you could use this enemy towards your advantage? Sounds weird? Not really. Just think: if you could live your life in your bed, without doing anything, just sitting there, would it really fullfil your needs? You may be inclined to say it would, but if you thought about it really careful, you would realize that it won't. Here's what you have to do, in order to make stress your ally:
Appreciate your ability to resist effort and stress as realistically as possible! If you don't underestimate or overestimate your ability to resist, challenges could actually become very pleasant.
After a stresful and/or challenging period, take some time off. Charge your batteries, so to speak. There's no better way of being prepared for whatever comes next
Do things that make you feel good, instead of making compromises and trying to please everybody. Your subconscious is way more active than you'd be tempted to think! Your innerself may be displeased with what you do, and so you will be feeling the effects.
Use efficient ways of relaxing! This is different for every person; you know (or should know) what makes you relaxe best. If you don't have any ideas, you could try yoga, swimming, taking long walks, drawing, singing, gardening, etc
3. Set up a (very) loose routine
Routine is a two-way knife; it can either be helpful, in some cases, or it can make your life pretty unpleasant. As for myself, I'm the go with the flow and improvise kind of man; I've always been that way. But even so, I feel the need for some stability at some times.
4. Love
Photo by Levana's Cats =^..^=
Recent studies have shown that people who are in love don't just feel better, they are better. The body works brilliantly and the brain has no problems. No need to talk about this… any kind of love will do!
5. Detach yourself from some things
Photo by Michael Mozzarella
After a long day, or just a stresful period, try to detach a bit from your problems; everybody has problems, but it's up to you to deal with them in the best way you can. If you want to solve them, try to analyze the situation and be as objective as possible. If you just want to relax, then try to find a method to take your mind off them. Try to meditate, or jog, or do whatever you feel is good. Do what suits you best!
I hope you've realized by now that being healthy doesn't reffer to just the body; the mind and soul have to be healthy too, even more than the body. Try to find a way to be happy with yourself, that's the first step. Then, appreciate what you have!
A former insider at Aipac has spilled the beans on a major secret initiative by The Israel Project (TIP) designed to counter opposition in the US to Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. Douglas Bloomfield, former chief lobbyist for Aipac, writes that TIP, a group dedicated to promoting Israel's positive image among the US media and policymakers, has circulated a 140-page primer designed to prompt supporters in their exchanges with US journalists and key decision-makers when they are arguing in favour of the settlements:
If you can't convince 'em, accuse 'em. That's the advice from The Israel Project (TIP) for pro-Israel activist. … Rather than try to defend Israeli settlements, change the subject. If that doesn't work, try accusing those who advocate removing Jewish settlements of promoting "a kind of ethnic cleansing to move all Jews" from the West Bank. TIP calls that "the best settlement argument" in its 2009 Global Language Dictionary.
You read the full document posted on Newsweek's site [PDF], and includes a preface by its author, the Republican pollster and spin doctor Frank Luntz. What is especially instructive about the document is that it concedes that Israel is on the defensive here in the US. It conveys a recognition that the new Obama administration policy on Israel has caused a sea change for the pro-Israel community. Instead of being on the offensive, always pressing its case, the lobby, perhaps for the first time, is in crisis mode. Bloomfield continues:
"The single toughest issue" to defend among Americans generally and American Jews in particular is settlements, says the manual, and "hostility towards them and towards Israeli policy that appears to encourage settlement activity. … Public opinion is hostile to the settlements – even among supporters of Israel."
Groups like TIP are not known for paying very close attention to truth or facts, and they don't disappoint here, according to Bloomfield:
TIP says the "best argument" for settlements is this: Since Arabs citizens of Israel "enjoy equal rights," telling Jews they can't live in the Palestinian state "is a racist idea."
In fact, Palestinian prime minister Salam Fayyad just last week invited settlers to remain in the West Bank after it becomes part of a Palestinian state with full rights. Rabbi Menachem Froman, a founder of Gush Emunim who lives in Tekoa on the West Bank, advocates a similar approach.
What is unique about Froman's stance is their awareness that it is important for them to live in the West Bank as a Jew rather than as an Israeli. They see what they are doing as a religious rather than political imperative. And their claim is that if you really believe in living on this land you will not care who rules you, since ultimately it is God and not a government that does so. The fact that Froman recently met with a senior US Middle East envoy in Washington indicates how open the Obama administration is to hearing hitherto marginal voices.
To indicate how closely American Jewish groups like TIP coordinate their message with Israel's diplomatic and intelligence agencies, Haaretz reports that Bibi Netanyahu met recently with the German foreign minister and in a masterful bit of guilt and manipulation told them that it was inconceivable to Israel that the West Bank could be "Judenrein".
Similarly, the false argument that dismantling settlements amounts to "ethnic cleansing" is a tried and true settler argument. It too involves grossly abusing the contemporary language of human rights in order to convert a simple political exercise (a territorial compromise with the Palestinians) into an act of racist violence against the people of Israel.
Bloomfield notes another specious argument in the TIP manual: "It falls back on the old and disproven argument that 'the settlements are necessary for the security of Israel.'"
By no measure can anyone claim that the settlements improve Israel's security. In fact, violence perpetrated by extremist settlers against Palestinians is a continuous source of friction, which forces thousands of IDF personnel to be stationed there to protect Jewish residents as they pursue their campaigns. Palestinians see the settlements and the occupation in general as painful reminders of their disenfranchisement. This in turn fuels acts of terrorist violence against settlers, which are often repaid in kind by Jewish extremists. Security? I think not.
Americans for Peace Now's Ori Nir places the issue in a broader context, also contradicting the TIP claim. "American Jews increasingly realise that settlements undermine Israel's ability to survive, long term, as a democratic Jewish state and that they undermine America's national security interest in a stable, peaceful Middle East," they told Bloomfield.
Barack Obama sees the settlements in this light, which is why they have made a full freeze a centrepiece of their policy. Generally, congressional Democrats, even those known to side with the Israel lobby in the past, have adopted the administration's position on the issue. All of which must be a painful reminder to TIP of how low its fortunes have sunk in the current domestic political environment.
In a few months, another graduating class of college students will stumble out into an unforgiving job market weighed down by staggering debt. But one school in one of the hottest hiring markets in the country is flipping the script on student loans: until you get a job, you don't pay.
App Academy in San Francisco (and now New York) offers a 9-week, 90-hours-a-week boot camp to turn programming novices into code jockeys. They just graduated their second class last Friday. Of the fifteen students to graduate from the first class, fourteen have found jobs, co-founder Kush Patel says. Typical annual salary, they say: more than $80,000.
"We don't want to charge up front because we feel pretty strongly about tying the payment to the outcome," says Patel. "If they can't find a job, we've screwed up somehow."
In tech hubs like Silicon Valley, he's not wrong. Qualified programmers in cities like San Francisco and New York fend off recruiters as multiple companies bid for their services. New recruits signing up for App Academy promise to pay 15 percent of what they earn during their first year on the job, payable over the first six months after they start working. For the school, the math isn't too shabby if they succeed at placing their students. If 15 students get jobs at $80,000 salaries, that works out to a $180,000 commission.

App Academy's model reverses the traditional incentive structure for higher education. If you're paying out of pocket for schooling, then the onus is on you to get the most out of the experience that you can. In other words, you want to get your money's worth. At App Academy, Patel says, the instructors are motivated to give you the highest quality learning experience they can, since the school doesn't get paid if you don't learn.
In the current job market, at least, the only worry for App Academy is if students decide to squander the investment the school has made in them. For example, after all the intensive instruction they decide they don't want to be programmers.
"The risk to us is students might want to go back to school or start their own business— or simply change their minds," Patel says. "We're actually very confident students can get jobs."
To keep students on track, App Academy requires them to sign a good-faith agreement that they will pursue jobs as developers when they graduate. They also have to pony up a $3,000 refundable deposit to hold their spots and show they're committed. (Patel says they're sometimes flexible on the deposit, depending on a student's circumstances.)
Admission to the school is competitive. Prospective students are asked to read an intro to coding and then take a timed coding test, as well as a live coding test during an admissions interview. The intent isn't to show previous coding knowledge, but rather programmer potential. The admission rate is "sub-10 percent," Patel says.
Though most students so far have been college graduates, they're coming into the program with a range of life experience. The average age is 28, and the classes include many mid-career switchers as well as recent grads. Most of the first class was unemployed when they came in and, Patel says, couldn't have afforded a big up-front tuition payment: They were "people who didn't have enough capital to invest in themselves." Finding a job for most after the class was over, Patel says, took an average of four weeks.
As a former hedge fund analyst, 25-year-old Patel would appear to know something about investing. Their co-founder, 26-year-old Ned Ruggeri, knows something about code: before starting App Academy, they were a developer on Google's search index team.
Though the curriculum is centered on learning web development, with an emphasis on Ruby on Rails and Javascript, Patel says the goal is to train full-fledged software engineers.
"It's just a skill that doesn't come easy to everyone and is just so valuable," Patel says. For App Academy, the value of that skill—and the instructors' talent at passing it on—is what will keep the lights on not just for graduates from but the school itself. "We will always have significant skin in the game," Patel says. "For every student."
ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I'm the mother of two daughters, a teen and a tween. So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions.
The cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12.
As I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in their right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, "Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN." Or "Are you EVEN listening to me?" Or any version of the very popular, "I hate YOU," "I hate you SO much," "I hate this family," or just plain "AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors.
So given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.
I told my teenage daughter I wanted them to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time they went to see their doctor.
"I don't want to."
"Well, sorry. You have to."
"I heard it hurts."
"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life."
"Oh. (pause) OK."
If you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.
The only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.
The HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.
"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus," they said. "Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer." Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls »
In this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.
The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.

Given those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?
The hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of "to give or not to give."
Let's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.
Merck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.
Ault explains why youth is key. Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted, "so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active, so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine." Another reason to do this early, Ault points out, is that "our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are, say, at 22."
Ault also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and, even more important, about the realities of life, such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.
These arguments aren't convincing to some parents, the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated. There are several reasons for doing this, including religious beliefs. Some faith-based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active.
Others believe the drug is just too risky. CDC spokesperson Curtis Allen says the vaccine is constantly being monitored by a joint CDC /FDA hotline. Parents, patients and physicians can call the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, to report any adverse reaction to the vaccine.
Through Freedom of Information Act petition, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch got records from VAERS that showed three deaths in girls who'd had the vaccine in March-April 2007 and over 1,600 adverse reactions reported from June 2006 to April 2007. All said the response came after getting the HPV vaccine.
Allen cautions restraint in considering the reports. "Most of these reactions were minor," they said, and the deaths "were linked to circumstances not related to the vaccine." The CDC and the FDA are constantly monitoring the VAERS hotline and won't hesitate to act should they see any dangerous trends due to the HPV vaccine, they said.
The vaccine does have some known side effects. Ault has seen their share. "I certainly hear from women who get the vaccine that it's painful, and I think some dizziness has been reported."
Don't Miss MayoClinic.com: Cervical cancer vaccine Q&A
In fact, fainting has been added to the list of potential side effects to watch for. Allen says doctors are now recommending that girls stay in their doctor's office for a short period after they get the injection for just that reason.
Three injections are necessary to get the full benefit of the vaccine. The shots need to be administered over a six-month period and at this stage are guaranteed to work for at least five years.
All of this information leaves me confused. Frankly, I'm not really sure I have won myself over when it comes to the "shot or no shot" decision for my daughters. However, in the back of my mind, I hear the words a father spoke when they thought about not giving the vaccine to their still-young daughter.
They said, "How am I going to be able to turn to my daughter when she's older and tell her, 'When you were younger, I had the chance of making sure you never got a certain type of cancer, and I decided not to do it' ?"
That's an emotional minefield I truly don't think I'm emotionally equipped to walk through. E-mail to a friend

Some serious health risks appear for astronauts living on a lunar base or going on deep space missions. Many threaten the astronauts' lives, and at least one may jeopardize all deep space missions for the foreseeable future.
10 Cardiac Problems
A 2014 study on 12 astronauts found that the heart becomes 9.4 percent more spherical after long exposure to microgravity, or weightlessness, in space. This could cause heart problems, especially on a deep space flight to Mars.
“The heart doesn't work as hard in space, which can cause a loss of muscle mass,” said Dr. James Thomas of NASA. “That can have serious consequences after the return to Earth, so we're looking into whether there are measures that can be taken to prevent or counteract that loss.”
So far, the change in shape reverts after the astronauts come back to Earth. But no one knows what the long-term effects will be. Doctors already know that astronauts experience dizziness when they return to Earth. Sometimes, a sudden blood pressure drop will cause them to pass out when they stand up. Some astronauts also experience arrhythmia in space.
The researchers need to devise exercise regimens to keep deep space astronauts safe from these effects. Certain people on Earth, such as those on bed rest or with heart failure, may also benefit from this kind of exercise.
A new five-year study is also underway to determine if space may speed up the development of atherosclerosis in astronauts.
9 Drinking And Psych Problems
Although NASA conducted an anonymous health care survey on its astronauts and ultimately dismissed concerns about excessive drinking, allegations were made in 2007 that drunk NASA astronauts were permitted to fly on the space shuttle and a Russian Soyuz spacecraft in two separate incidents. This happened even though flight surgeons and other astronauts allegedly brought their safety concerns to local managers.
At that time, NASA's policy prohibited drinking for 12 hours before astronauts flew training jets. The policy was supposed to apply to spaceflights, too. To avoid any doubt, NASA made their “bottle to throttle” rule official after an independent panel reviewed the matter.
One retired astronaut, Mike Mullane, said some astronauts drink alcohol before a flight to dehydrate themselves and make the countdown to launch more comfortable on their bladders.
Psychological issues have also occurred in space. On the Skylab 4 mission, astronauts got so testy with mission control that they turned off their radio and ignored NASA for a day. Researchers are now studying the potential effects of a longer, more stressful deep space mission to Mars.
8 Sleep Deficiencies And Use Of Sleep Aids
A 10-year sleep study showed that astronauts don't get enough sleep for weeks before and during their space missions. Three out of four also use sleep medications, which may be dangerous when operating the spacecraft or other equipment. This is particularly concerning if all the astronauts on a mission take the same drug at the same time, especially if they must awaken for an emergency alarm.
NASA schedules 8.5 hours of sleep each night for astronauts, but most only get around six hours during their missions. They also get less than 6.5 hours of sleep each night during the three months of training before a flight.
“Future . . . missions to the Moon, Mars, or beyond will require development of more effective countermeasures to promote sleep during spaceflight to optimize human performance,” said senior study author Dr. Charles Czeisler. “These measures may include scheduling modifications, strategically timed exposure to specific wavelengths of light, and behavioral strategies to ensure adequate sleep, which is essential for maintaining health, performance, and safety.”
7 Hearing Loss
Studies have shown that even one shuttle mission could cause a substantial temporary hearing loss and a smaller permanent hearing loss, usually at the higher frequencies involved in hearing speech. Crews aboard the Soviet Salyut 7 and the Russian Mir space stations also registered temporary and permanent hearing losses after they returned. Again, higher frequencies were most affected.
On the International Space Station, astronauts initially had to wear ear plugs all day. But NASA developed ways to reduce the noise levels with acoustic padding for the walls and quieter fans, among other measures.
Besides the noise levels, other factors that may contribute to hearing loss in space include atmospheric contaminants, higher intracranial pressure, and greater carbon dioxide levels.
In 2015, NASA will study how to prevent hearing loss during a one-year mission to the International Space Station with two crew members. They want to see how much hearing they can preserve for these individuals and determine an acceptable risk for hearing loss. Ultimately, they want to figure out how to minimize hearing loss over an astronaut's lifetime, not just one mission.
6 Kidney Stones
About 1 in 10 people develop a kidney stone during their lifetime on Earth. But that risk is far greater for astronauts in space because bones demineralize in a weightless environment. That releases salt such as calcium phosphate into the blood. Concentrating in the kidneys, these salts may form stones that range in size from microscopic to as big as a walnut. Kidney stones may cause excruciating pain. But it's also possible for the kidney to stop working if a stone blocks the tube that drains the organ.
For astronauts, the risk intensifies because microgravity also causes a decline in blood volume. In addition, many astronauts don't drink the 2 liters (0.5 gal) of water needed to stay completely hydrated and pass the stones in their urine.
At least 14 American astronauts developed kidney stones shortly after their missions ended. And in 1982, one Soviet cosmonaut doubled over in excruciating pain for two days on the Salyut 7 space station while their crewmate watched helplessly. Before the Soviets were able to launch a rescue for what they thought was appendicitis, the cosmonaut passed a small stone in their urine.
Scientists have been working on an ultrasound machine about the size of a desktop computer to detect kidney stones and push them out of the kidney with short bursts of sound waves.
5 Lungs And Dust
Although we don't know what effects dust from other planets or asteroids will have on our astronauts, we do know that moon dust caused some problems on their lunar missions.
The most dangerous effect may be on the lungs if the fine particulates of moon dust are inhaled. Extremely sharp-edged moon dust can harm the heart and lungs, with effects ranging from inflammation to a heightened risk of cancer. It's somewhat like inhaling asbestos.
This sharp-edged dust can also cause irritation and abrasions on skin. In fact, it's been known to wear through multiple layers on a boot of Kevlar-like material. Lunar dust can also scratch the cornea of an astronaut's eye, causing an especially serious emergency in space.
But researchers admit they can't duplicate the conditions of the Moon for their tests. For example, on Earth, the dust particles are no longer in a vacuum or exposed to radiation. Only more studies conducted on the Moon, rather than in a lab, will give scientists the rest of the information they need about lunar dust toxicity.
4 Confused Immune System
On Earth, our immune systems change if we don't get enough sleep or nutrition or if we're under too much stress. The immune systems of astronauts on lengthy missions seem to change while in space, turning a simple cold or the flu into a potentially serious health risk.
The distribution of immune cells doesn't change much. But the functioning of the cells may be higher or lower than normal, confusing the immune system. When the immune cell function slacks off, dormant viruses in a human body can reactivate, though without symptoms of sickness. When the cell function goes into overdrive, the immune system overreacts, causing allergies and rashes.
“Things like radiation, microbes, stress, microgravity, altered sleep cycles, and isolation could all have an effect on crew member immune systems,” said NASA immunologist Brian Crucian. “If the situation persisted for longer deep space missions, it could possibly increase risk of infection, hypersensitivity, or autoimmune issues for exploration astronauts.”
If necessary, NASA will use newer kinds of radiation shielding, nutrition supplements, and medications to counteract these changes to the immune system.
3 Radiation Hazards
An extremely unusual and long absence of solar activity is causing dangerous radiation levels in space. Nothing like this has been seen for almost 100 years. “While these conditions are not necessarily a showstopper for long-duration missions to the Moon, an asteroid, or even Mars, galactic cosmic radiation in particular remains a significant and worsening factor that limits mission durations,” explained Nathan Schwadron of the UNH Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space.
The effects of this type of exposure range from radiation sickness to cancer and organ damage. These radiation levels will also reduce the number of allowable days behind the shielding of a spacecraft by 20 percent.
One mission to Mars could expose an astronaut to two-thirds of their or their safe lifetime limit of radiation. This radiation may damage human DNA and increase cancer risk. “In terms of accumulated dose, it's like getting a whole-body CT scan once every five or six days,” said scientist Cary Zeitlin.
2 Cognitive Problems
When simulating deep space conditions, scientists discovered that exposure to high-energy particles, even in low doses, caused rats to react more slowly and become distracted. The rats also showed protein changes in their brains.
But not every rat was affected the same way. If that's true for astronauts, the researchers believe they can devise a biological marker to predict which astronauts will experience these effects. Then they might be able to lessen the effects of radiation for those people.
A more serious concern is Alzheimer's. “Exposure to radiation levels equivalent to a mission to Mars could produce cognitive problems and speed up changes in the brain that are associated with Alzheimer's disease,” said neuroscientist Kerry O'Banion. The more time in space, the bigger the risk for the astronaut.
The one bright spot is that the scientists tested a worst-case scenario. They flooded the rats with the full amount of an entire mission's radiation at once. Astronauts would be exposed to that radiation amount over three years. The human body may adapt to the smaller doses.
Also, plastics and other lightweight materials may provide astronauts with more protection from radiation than aluminum currently does.
1 Vision Loss
Some astronauts have developed serious, permanent vision problems from their time in space. The longer the mission, the greater the chance of change. Of the 300 US astronauts examined since 1989, vision problems developed in 29 percent of those on two-week missions and a whopping 60 percent of those who spent several months on the International Space Station.
Doctors at the University of Texas performed brain scans on 27 astronauts who'd been in space for over a month. In over 25 percent of them, the back of one or both eyes had flattened. This shortened the affected eyeball, making the person more farsighted. Again, the longer in space, the more severe and more likely the problem.
Scientists believe this may be another effect of the rise of fluid that occurs in a person's body in a weightless, or microgravity, environment. In this case, the pressure seems to build inside the skull from the increased flow of cerebrospinal fluid into the head. The fluid can't expand the bone, so it flattens the eyeballs instead. Researchers don't know if this effect will diminish or intensify for astronauts in space longer than six months. But it's critical to find out before sending a crew on a Mars mission that could last at least one year.
If the problem is caused by intracranial pressure, one possible solution is to create artificial gravity for about eight hours each day by spinning the spaceship while the astronauts sleep. But it's too soon to tell if that will work. “This is one [problem] that we don't yet have a good handle on, and it can be a showstopper [for long-duration missions],” said NASA scientist Mark Shelhamer.
The headlines say the news is good.
Official unemployment in the U.S. dropped from 6.7 to 6.3 percent, the lowest rate in five years, as 288,000 nonfarm jobs were added, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
The steep drop in the unemployment rate, however, was a function of more than 800,000 unemployed Americans dropping out of the job-seeking market altogether. Only 62.8 percent of working-age Americans are employed or looking for work, back to lows seen in December.
Some economists say that drop may reflect the end of unemployment benefits for some at the end of last year: no longer receiving benefits, some of the unemployed may no longer be fooling themselves (and BLS survey takers) that they're looking for work. And the monthly household survey actually found 73,000 jobs were lost last month. The New York Times explains:
It's tempting to try to combine the two surveys into one neat package and claim that the economy added jobs, albeit not enough to bring people back into the labor force. But that's not right. If you believe the household survey, the economy lost jobs. If you believe the business survey--which is much larger than the household survey--job growth was quite strong. They cannot both be right.
The Times suggests a wait and see approach for anyone trying to claim the labor market is gaining strength. Job numbers for February and March, incidentally, were revised upward. Prior to the release of the jobs report, economists predicted 211,000 jobs were created last month.
The Wall Street Journal ran some reactions on the numbers from economists from across the spectrum. Some, naturally, dismissed the caution the conflicting numbers should warrant. Via WSJ:
that the decline in the unemployment rate was largely due to a massive 806,000 drop in the labor force, which more than offset a disappointing 73,000 decline in the household measure of employment. But the household figures are notoriously volatile and the labor force had increased by about 1.5 million over the past six months. –Paul Ashworth, Capital Economicscan be explained by the participation rate, the drop in the participation rate merely reversed the rise in the previous three months. For the year to date, the participation rate is flat and the unemployment rate is down another 0.4 points. In short, the trend in employment remains more than strong enough to keep unemployment trending down. –Jim O'Sullivan, High Frequency Economics
Writing in The Huffington Post, former Obama administration economist Jared Bernstein also advised caution over the numbers:
So, as my Grandma might have asked, what's not to like?It's this: the decline in unemployment is entirely due not to job creation, but to labor force decline (employment actually fell slightly in the household survey). This important and closely watched indicator -- the labor force participation rate -- also fell 0.4 tenths, reversing recent gains and returning the lfpr to its low where it stood at the end of last year, commensurate with levels we haven't seen since the late 1970s. Though part of the recent decline in the participation rate reflects our aging demographics, more than half in my judgment is due to weak demand.The BLS noted that the large decline in the labor force -- about -800,000 -- was likely due to fewer entrants as opposed to more leavers. And this is a volatile number, as I stress below. But neither can it be dismissed out of hand: it has been essentially stuck at historically low levels for a while now.
The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, gained against other currencies after the better-than-expected jobs report.
Among the various organs and devices that make Formula One tick, few are as important as new winners.
The appearance of new faces on the podium is not only exciting in that they herald the arrival of promising young talents who finally get an opportunity to prove their worth, but they are also a sign of regeneration in the driver pool. New winners are evidence of a healthy sport.
Formula One's last new winner was Daniel Ricciardo at last year's Canadian Grand Prix, and just as is the case with the Australian, the 10 drivers to take their first win in the last 10 years are pilots of pedigree. Pastor Maldonado's 2012 Spanish Grand Prix win is the exception to the rule, though even they are not totally bereft of talent.
Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share
But while all (most) winning drivers are talented, not all talented drivers are winners, and there are scores of deserving grand prix drivers who have never had the opportunity to taste the champagne and whose careers have subsequently withered.
This year one such man is likely to have at least pencilled their name into this unfortunate record book is Kevin Magnussen. Once McLaren's great new hope, now seatless in 2016.
The Dane, son of former Formula One driver Jan Magnussen, found out via email on their birthday that there would be no place for them at the famous English team from 2016 having already stated their non-negotiable preference to race next season rather than have a second consecutive year on the sidelines. The split, in other words, was as mutual as it could be.
There are few seats left available for the 23-year-old, however, bar a potential seat at Lotus in the event Renault buys the team and an opportunity at Manor should they suddenly find a portfolio of sponsors to back their drive. Their immediate future in Formula One is bleak.
Formula One's potential loss is doubly disappointing when you consider that McLaren had invested significantly in its young drivers – the other being the ascending Stoffel Vandoorne, who will take Magnussen's reserve driver role next year – only to see the effort largely wasted. History will record Magnussen's fleeting career as little more than a stopgap while the team waited to snare Fernando Alonso's services.
But then what should we have expected of McLaren's young driver programme when the only possible destination after Formula One's feeder series is McLaren itself?

Unlike some of Formula One's other significant teams McLaren has no formal or informal associate team to which it can assign its young drivers to break them in. Where Red Bull owns Toro Rosso and where Ferrari and Mercedes supply Sauber and Manor respectively with engines, McLaren is isolated.
To make matters worse, there is no foreseeable way for McLaren to rebuild its influence. With Manor and Force India taken by Mercedes and with Sauber and new boys Haas taken by Ferrari, and with the Honda power unit desperately unloved in any case, McLaren has no options to pursue.
Woking's political solitude has come at a particularly costly time, too. If Magnussen's defection wasn't disappointing enough, the blow will be trebled should Vandoorne likewise find McLaren without vacancy in 2017. In many respects the runaway GP2 champion's talents are already set to be wasted in 2016 by sitting out Formula One as a third driver, whether or not they are seconded to Japan's Super Formula.
McLaren should be applauded for nurturing new talent and for attempting to create an internal succession plan to stand it in good stead when its elder statesmen call time on their careers, but just as was revealed with Ron Dennis' bungling of Button's 2016 contract, there is significant misalignment among the people making the recruiting decision at the McLaren Technology Centre.
So with one probable winner likely out of the Formula One frame, at least in the short term, all eyes now turn to how McLaren will slot the impressive Vandoorne into its line-up and the Formula One picture. However, things are already off to a bad start in single-seater land, with a newly-released Kevin Magnussen on the market…
Ironically McLaren's attempt to bring in new winners, boosting itself and the sport, may be backfiring and depriving Formula One of some of its most talented newcomers.
Europe is starting to shut down the free flow of refugees
Reuters
Over 1 million refugees are estimated to enter in the European Union this year as they flee the wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern and African nations.
While most of the 28 nations in the bloc pledged to take in thousands of refugees — Germany promised to take 800,000 asylum seekers in 2015 alone — the EU has started putting up barriers to manage the flow.
EU and Balkan leaders met in Brussels over the weekend and hashed out a 17-point plan to better manage the migrants. The EU said today the UN refugee council would help countries set up "reception centres" that will be dotted along the route that asylum seekers use to get to "refugee-friendly" countries such as Germany.
Each country is handling the refugee crisis differently. Some are particularly conservative when it comes to taking more asylum seekers on board. For example, at the beginning of September, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the refugee was a "German problem" – mainly because the country said all refugees are welcome to go there.
They added that Europe has improperly encouraged refugees to come into Europe's "Schengen Area," which doesn't have strict border control. Proposals suggesting that European countries take in a quota of migrants based on population and wealth have made it seem like refugees should "just come because we are ready to accept everybody," which "would be a moral failure because this is not the case," Orban said. And because of Orban's stance, refugees have now started going to Croatia.
On top of that, countries like Slovenia, which has a relatively small population of only 2 million people, saw 60,000 new migrants enter the country over the last week. Greece is also struggling to cope with the influx of refugees, mainly because it is already trying to tackle major unemployment, poverty and other issues stemming from austerity measures imposed on it to obtain emergency bailout funds.
"We have made very clear that the policy of simply waving people through must be stopped,"said Jean-Claude Juncker, EU Commission president to reporters in Brussels.
German chancellor Angela Merkel added at the same conference: “Europe must show it is a continent of values, a continent of solidarity ... This is a building block, but we need to take many further steps.”
Other points in the EU's new plan to manage the refugee crisis includes:
"Discouraging the movement of refugees or migrants to the border of another country of the region without informing neighbouring countries."
"Ensuring a full capacity to register arrivals, with maximum use of biometric data."
"Deploying in Slovenia 400 police officers and essential equipment within a week, through bilateral support."

Russia is often portrayed in the Western media as being a backwards crazy place. However, there are certain aspects of Russian culture that I find preferable to living in the West. This article lists the top four things that I like about Russia.
1. Less Bullshit
Russians simply don't have time for pointless bullshit. They have too many real problems to deal with, and thus do not care about which political pundit is being protested at Berkeley or what the Kardashians are up to on any given week. As an American, I find this to be incredibly refreshing. The United States is world's top supplier of pointless bullshit. Those who live in the US must contend with having an endless stream of BS constantly being funneled at them from their televisions, smart phones, and Facebook feeds.
Now don't get me wrong, there still is a huge market for bullshit in Russia. But most Russians normally recognize something as being bullshit, although they might not publicly acknowledge it. When witnessing arguments between Russians, I often feel that one side knows that the other side is right, but still chooses to argue anyway as a way of defending their personal pride or when they know that the other side can't prove their argument.
Russian bullshit takes the form of a new business partner telling you that they don't know what happened to your money, or the police asking you to pay a “fee” so that they can instantly process a transgression and thus not need to bring you down to the station. In Russia, both parties are generally aware that something is bullshit, and the bullshitting is done to serve a specific purpose.
In the United States, the use of bullshit is further extended for the purposes of promotion, spectacle, and as a distraction to fill the void of a meaningless life. While certain instances of conniving bullshit may cause one problem in Russia, the endless pointless caustic type of bullshit which slowly erodes one's sanity is more easily avoidable.
2. Flexibility
In Russia, a solution for most situations can normally be found, although it will likely require a cash transaction. Since the standard procedures for many things are often inadequate or overly cumbersome, there is a market for improvised solutions. Depending on who you are and what you need done, this flexibility could be to your benefit. You do not always have to operate within the strict confines of a system as is required in places such as Germany.
Russia is a country of loopholes. In some cases, people use a certain loophole so often that it has become the standard way of accomplishing something, even if it is not the official way that it should be done. For example, many Russians from Saint Petersburg apply for Europe travel visas from their neighbor Finland, given that they are the easiest to have approved. They still do this despite Finland not being the actual destination in Europe to which they desire to travel. After getting their visa approved, they will even make an initial trip to Finland just to get the required stamp in their passports before heading off to Spain or where ever else it is that they really want to go.
Likewise, foreigners who desire to stay in Russia for longer periods of time, often apply for three month business visas although they have no actual business to do in the country. They simple pay a fee to an agency which finds a Russian company to sponsor the visa. When they arrive at the boarder, It's pretty obvious to the guards that they plan to stay in Western Russia and are not heading further East to Siberia to do business with Pavel's Ball Bearings Inc. This being another instance of mutually recognized and accepted bullshit, the foreigners are let in. Fortunately US citizens don't need to play this game given that they can apply for a three year tourist visa to Russia.
3. No PC Cultures.
In Russia, generally you can speak your mind more openly without worrying about being shamed for not totally subscribing to a rigid ideology. You won't be receiving self righteous condemnations from 20 year old liberal arts students with no real life experience. While in Russia there are a few subjects that are much more taboo and less open for discussion than in the West, overall people could really care less about what you say. If they think that you are an idiot or don't like you, they will let you know. This leads to more authentic and honest conversations. While I'm all for general politeness and common courtesy, the growing PC culture in the US has become incredibly overbearing.
4. Women
Russian women are in a class completely of their own. The tough environment in which they have grown up has made them incredibly strong, and yet they have still been able to hold onto their femininity. In Russia, femininity and fortitude are not mutually exclusive personal attributes, unlike how they are often portrayed as being in the United States and other Western countries. There is still a healthy and natural polarization between men and women in Russia, and the natural differences between between the two genders are to expected and celebrated. Men and women can be equals without being exactly the same in every way. I believe this leads to greater harmony and fulfillment within relationships.
Having come face to face with the cold hard reality of the world, most Russians don't have the same sense of entitlement that you may find in Western nations. While most Russian women dream about getting married and having children, their dream is centered around the family itself. This differs from the common “me me me” attitude found in the West, which involves tens of thousands of dollars being spent on engagement rings, wedding dresses and other paraphernalia. Russian women take personal responsibility for their own happiness and fulfillment and don't expect it to be externally provided to them.
The combined beauty, elegance, grace, and intellect of the average Russian women is incredibly hard to match.

An officer shot the man, who was identified as 38-year-old Billy Ray Scott. Scott was taken to a hospital in critical condition, and remained hospitalized in serious condition Tuesday afternoon.
Police said all of their officers were OK. Officer Zachary Jones, who shot the man, will be put on administrative leave, which is routine for shootings involving police officers.
Jones, who is assigned to the central patrol division, has been with the department for a year and a half.
The department said in a statement that they reviewed why the bait car did not shut down as it was supposed to, and have "made corrections" to ensure it does not happen again. Police did not release what the technical issue was.
So far this year, about 3,000 car burglaries and crashes have been reported in Dallas. About this time last year, the number was about 3,450.
The Dallas Police Department has said its bait cars are not intended to rack up arrests; they are used as deterrents for vehicle thefts. Police get alerts when a bait car is broken into, and they can usually track the car if it is stolen.
Last year, a suspect bailed from a bait truck just before it dropped 30 feet and crashed upside down on Interstate 30 in West Dallas.

Putin says US behavior ‘destroys international law' as bill is passed for Trump's signature after going through Congress
Vladimir Putin has accused US lawmakers of “insolence”, and promised Russia will retaliate if the latest round of US sanctions against Russia are signed into law.
The House of Representatives voted by 419 votes to three on Tuesday to pass the new sanctions bill, which targets Russia as well as North Korea and Iran.
Trump's Russia problem: who's in the deepest? Read more
The US legislation was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate on Thursday, and will now go to Donald Trump for their signature. Trump, who enjoyed two warm conversations with Putin at the G20 summit earlier this month, is likely to face a major backlash if they attempt to veto the legislation, with their administration already embroiled in a Russia scandal.
“We are behaving in a very restrained and patient way, but at some moment we will need to respond,” said Putin at a press conference with their Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö.
“It's impossible to endlessly tolerate this kind of insolence towards our country,” Putin said, referring to the sanctions. “This practice is unacceptable – it destroys international relations and international law.”
Putin was vague on exactly how Russia might respond. The newspaper Kommersant quoted two unnamed sources saying a range of potential responses was under consideration in Moscow, including expelling US diplomats, seizing diplomatic properties, increasing restrictions on US companies working in Russia and halting enriched uranium shipments to US power plants.
Before leaving office, Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and the seizure of two Russian diplomatic compounds, in retaliation for Russian meddling in the US election. Russia made the unusual move of not responding reciprocally, allegedly after being given assurances that the incoming Trump administration would reverse the move.
However, that has not happened, and the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova complained recently that US authorities were not granting visas to Russian diplomats the foreign ministry wants to send to replace those expelled. They said reciprocal measures would be forthcoming if this policy did not change.
Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly denied any meddling in the US election, while US intelligence agencies say they have overwhelming evidence of a coordinated Russian campaign. Putin on Thursday described the allegations as “hysteria”, and said: “It's a great pity that Russian-US relations are being sacrificed to resolve questions of domestic politics.”
Although Trump has repeatedly spoken of a desire for improved relations with Russia, the electoral interference allegations have prompted Democrats and Republicans to unite in support of tougher sanctions. It seems inevitable that further US sanctions will be met with a firm Russian response.
“Hope dies last but it is dying,” wrote Konstantin Kosachev, the chairperson of the foreign relations committee of Russia's upper house of parliament, after the US vote on Tuesday. “The further degradation of bilateral cooperation is inevitable, even though it seems like it couldn't get any worse.”

Those arraigned Thursday: Frances Crowe, Northampton Priscilla Lynch, Conway Erik Burcroff, Plainfield Dennis Carr, Cummington Ellen Grave, West Springfield Connie Harvard, Northampton Laura Simon, Wilder, Vt. Elizabeth Carretti-Ramirez, Holyoke
GREAT BARRINGTON — Frances Crowe is often seen smiling. But on the courthouse steps, the 98-year-old activist went stern.
"This is a serious business we're involved in," they said, speaking from their wheelchair. "This is the future of life on the planet. Are the corporations going to rule the future, or will people rise up and say no?"
Crowe, a longtime, legendary peace and environmental activist was among eight anti-pipeline activists arraigned in Southern Berkshire District Court Thursday after arrests Saturday for trespassing on state-owned and protected land in Otis State Forest.
Crowe and the others were swiftly told by the assistant court clerk - before the judge was even seated - that the state had decriminalized their charges, and that their civil hearing was set for July 18.
The state had similarly reduced the same charges against 24 other activists affiliated with climate justice group Sugar Shack Alliance, who were arrested in early May.
The activists had crossed into Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.'s easement and temporarily stopped pipe-laying work to this part of the company's 13-mile tri-state Connecticut Expansion Project.
Construction of the natural gas storage loop is well underway, and still sowing anger among activists and residents over a host of issues, mainly that the Kinder Morgan subsidiary wrestled a roughly 2-mile easement from the state in court.
The land is protected by Article 97 of the state constitution, but a superior court judge ruled that the federal Natural Gas Act of 1938 held sway over state laws.
On the courthouse steps after the arraignment, Crowe said why they had traveled to Sandisfield, where they were arrested next to an open pipe trench.
"Corporations come and go, but life is in jeopardy," they said.
They then compared their hint at modern complacency with what happened during World War II - a time they can actually remember, since they were in their 20s.
"[We need to] stop being good Germans," they added. "We let Hitler do what they did."
The events leading to the Saturday arrests unfolded after a rally at Lower Spectacle Pond. Around 60 activists then walked back to Sugar Shack's staging ground on private land in Sandisfield, where the Thoreau Cabin Pipeline Barricade was reconstructed in May next to the company's easement. The cabin was originally built to draw attention to the Northeast Energy Direct pipeline (NED), which was tabled by Kinder Morgan last year.
Sugar Shack members, who are mostly from Franklin County, had celebrated the demise of the NED project, but vowed to take on any future new pipelines within their reach.
Two company pipelines run through the state forest here already - one built in 1951 and the other in 1981. Tennessee Gas had to widen the easement to make room for this line, which will hold 36-inch pipes and gas intended mostly for Connecticut customers.
It was from the cabin that activists pushed Crowe in their wheelchair down the existing corridor - abloom with wildflowers and tall grass - to the open pipe trench, stopping machinery, and causing Tennessee Gas workers to get on their cell phones and walkie-talkies.
Crowe has been arrested numerous times in their life, and three times since turning 90. They said Saturday they hadn't been arrested enough. Though they wanted to be arrested, it wasn't an easy day, they said.
After the arraignment, Sugar Shack spokesperson Vivienne Simon, who was one of the first to be arrested in May, said decriminalizing the trespassing charges makes it easier to risk getting arrested again, without more severe penalties that could include jail time.
And Elizabeth Carretti-Ramirez, who was arrested Saturday and on May 6, said it was a "mixed bag."
"We would like this to go to trial," said the Holyoke resident. "But selfishly, [the civil charges] makes my life easier."
But those minor, civil charges weren't so easy for Judge Paul Vrabel or the attorneys at last week's hearing for the protesters charged in May. All were faced with a set of trespassing circumstances that grew convoluted next to a law that says that, for the trespassing charge to stick, the land must be "enclosed" or "improved" - not an easy call about state forest access roads the activists had blocked.
While Vrabel is expected to rule on that matter any day now, the activists are looking for new ways to stop the pipeline, which, if on schedule, will take about four more months of construction to complete.
They said they've got ideas and that they're creative, but they will take escalation only so far.
"We are still committed to nonviolence," Carretti-Ramirez said, noting that they and fellow defendant, Laura Simon of Wilder, Vt., had also gone to North Dakota to entrench at Standing Rock to oppose Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline.
"It's all one big pipeline," they added, repeating one of the group's maxims about new pipeline projects everywhere.
And of Tennessee Gas' new, $93 million line, they wondered why that money couldn't have been invested in solar and wind. They said corporate profit is fine as long as it isn't at the expense of health and the planet.
"It's not that we don't want people to make money," they said.
And about this planet, Crowe said they would devote their remaining years to it.
"I'm fortunate to be here," they said.

This fresh-faced young man is Kim Seong-Min, who as recently as last month was a regular high school student in South Korea. But he's a lefty pitcher, which automatically makes them one of the most desirable people on Earth, and the Orioles swooped in to cause an international incident and get their organization banned from an entire country. This is not normally how a rebuilding process goes, O's fans.
The Orioles signed Kim, and new GM Dan Duquette called him"one of the top amateur left-handed pitchers in South Korea" who has "an excellent curveball and very good control." They paid them a cool half-million dollars, and Kim was to report to Orioles spring training this week.
We have long since passed the days when Koreans were thrilled just to see one of their own make it in the Major Leagues. The domestic KBO, having recently moved away from a territorial draft, is concerned that too many young stars are coming to America and weakening the level of talent over there. (Kim is the 56th Korean player to sign with an MLB club.) So they decided make their stand here and now, and come down hard on poor Baltimore.
First, Kim was suspended indefinitely from ever playing in South Korea, no small penalty considering very few prospects make it in America—only 12 have reached the Big Leagues. Then, the whole Orioles scouting department was banned from the country. This is not an exaggeration: no Orioles employees are allowed to attend amateur baseball games anywhere in South Korea. A fruitful and emerging theater for young baseball talent, completely closed off to the Orioles.
It gets worse. Despite an official apology from Dan Duquette, MLB caved to South Korean protests and declared Kim's contract with the Orioles null and void. Kim will stay in Korea, where presumably their suspension will be lifted, and the O's have nothing to show for their efforts except a travel ban.

The most fascinating part of all this is that MLB didn't have to do anything. The Orioles broke none of their rules. Sure, Korean rules prohibit Korean teams from signing high schoolers, but there's nothing on the books stopping an American team from doing it. All Baltimore violated was a gentleman's agreement—"a breach in protocol"—not to negotiate with Korean players before alerting the KBO. MLB's reasons for voiding Kim's contract are twofold: to hopefully get Orioles scouts back into the country, and to stay on friendly terms with Korean baseball. They value the talent pipeline from South Korea, as well as the millions of dollars spent on MLB merchandise there each year. MLB would rather be exalted as the ultimate destination for a select few Korean stars than be resented as an organization that raids the KBO's prospects. MLB figures its own interests are better served by allowing for a healthy domestic Korean league, and if that has to come at the expense of the Orioles looking the fool? It's only the Orioles.
When the Leafs claimed Frank Corrado on waivers on October 6 from the Vancouver Canucks, there was a consensus about the move: the Leafs acquired a young player to bolster their roster depth, and they gave up nothing to do it. Good move.
The expectation, however, was that Corrado would play semi-regularly, or at all. One quarter into the season, and Frank Corrado has yet to play a single game for the Toronto Maple Leafs.
The reason? In part a disconnect between coaching and management. While the front office saw a free wallet, coach Mike Babcock may well view Corrado as a piece unable to fit into a crowded roster. Babcock would likely prefer to use Corrado, a right-handed shot, on the right side. There is no chance that top four blueliners Dion Phaneuf and Morgan Rielly would sit to make room for Corrado, and Babcock seems attached to Roman Polak on the third pair. With four left-shot blueliners occupying the left side of the defensive depth chart, there's also no opportunity for Corrado to play on theirs off-side.
Barring injury, it appears that Corrado will remain a staple of the press box so long as they are on the NHL roster.
As James Mirtle notes, this predicament is not limited to Corrado or the Leafs. Jared Tinordi of the Montreal Canadiens has yet to play a single game. Victor Bartley of the Nashville Predators has played only one game this season. Dylan McIlrath? Four games for the New York Rangers. Tomas Jurco? Four games with the Detroit Red Wings. Jamie Oleksiak? Just five games with the Dallas Stars.
Most of these players are young- Bartley is the oldest at 27- but remain in the press box. They don't see much, if any, game action with the team. But they do remain on the NHL roster. The 2015-16 season has seen a considerably large cohort of what I call "milk carton" players: those who have seen such limited game action at any level, that I'd be inclined to slap their faces on the side of a milk carton if the media attending practices didn't tell us that these players were still alive and skating.
Why Don't Milk Cartons Ride The Bus?
So, if the milk carton players are seeing such limited game time, would it not make logical sense to send them to the minors? After all, the NHL club seems to have no use for them, so the logic would then follow that it would be best for everyone involved to demote these players to the AHL.
That would be true if, as Mirtle notes, it weren't for waivers. Most of you understand waivers, but for those reading who may not, a primer: before sending a player to the AHL, teams have until 12:00 p.m. ET the following day to file a claim to acquire that player. If a player is claimed, they join that team's NHL roster rather than going to the AHL.
Under the current CBA, a player is initially waiver-exempt (i.e. the team can demote them to the AHL without the risk that another team may claim him) to a certain threshold of years under contract and/or NHL games played at a certain age. You can see a table outlining this threshold here. The years under the contract, however, is the dominant threshold; once a player has hit that mark, they are waiver-eligible regardless of games played. Given that many players sign an ELC at a young age, becoming waiver-eligible by 22-23 years old is not extraordinary.
As an example, we know Corrado is waiver-eligible because that's how the Leafs got him. Despite having only played 28 NHL games at 22, they signed their first NHL contract with the Canucks in 2012, thus reaching the 3-year threshold for players their age.
The problem simply is in a cap world, teams just don't want to risk losing a young asset for nothing. While teams may not have a regular spot for these players, injuries do happen, and they may want to keep them around to fill holes as needed.
Specifically with the Leafs and Corrado, the risk of losing the asset is real. The Canucks never wanted to lose Corrado, and it's more than likely they'd reclaim them if the Leafs were exposed them to the waiver wire. Even if they didn't, there are plenty of teams at the bottom of the standings that could use the help on their blueline.
There is only one way these players can go to the AHL without waivers: a conditioning loan. Per Paragraph 13.8 of the CBA, a team is allowed to loan a player directly to their AHL affiliate for the purpose of a conditioning stint. Corrado spent seven games with the Toronto Marlies on such a stint, while Jurco is currently doing the same for Detroit's AHL affiliate in Grand Rapids.
The problem: Paragraph 13.8 stipulates the loan must end after fourteen days. And a player is only entitled to one loan per season. And the NHL can veto loans if they feel it is done to circumvent the rules, as they did in 2013 when the Sabres attempted to loan Mikhail Grigorenko to Rochester to circumvent the NHL-CHL transfer agreement. In fact, you could very well argue the Leafs are lucky the NHL did not veto Corrado's conditioning loan given that it was likely intended to give them some game action they otherwise would not have seen.
This has put several young players in a purgatory of sorts. They're not able to earn a regular roster spot on their team, but are too valuable of an asset for the team to risk losing to waivers. The player could theoretically demand a trade, but how does a team trade someone for fair value who they aren't even playing?
The end result- spending their time mired in the pressbox, seeing next to no game action- is about the worst possible thing for players' development. If you're the NHLPA, this should be a concern: a number of players that you represent aren't getting any opportunity to play.
So, how do you fix it?
CBA Solutions
There are a few potential options you could look at here, and I'll outline the advantages and disadvantages of each.
1) In-Season Quota for Waiver Eligibility
How it works: the NHL installs a percentage quota for games played in-season to determine waiver eligibility. If a player has appeared in less than, let's say, 40% of the games their team has played, they would be exempted from waivers. The Leafs, for example, have played 21 games so far this year. Using this quota, anyone with less than 8 GP would currently be exempted (like Corrado, and his, y'know, zero games).
Advantages: it solves the basic problem of players perpetually sitting out at the NHL level. If teams can't commit to giving a player regular playing time, they have the option of sending them to the AHL without risk of waivers.
Disadvantages: it may not actually solve the problem entirely, but create it in other circumstances. Let's say you have a player you want to send to the AHL but is above the 40% threshold. For argument's sake, he's played in 8 of your team's 15 games. You could risk losing that player on waivers, or you could sit them for seven games so that they fall under the exemption. Most teams would choose the latter; the problem in this case is that you're still sitting a player for almost two full weeks just to exploit the loophole. That goes against the spirit of what this rule change would be trying to achieve, doesn't it?
Also, no two game absences are alike. Does a strict GP quota include injury, or just healthy scratches? Is there an age cutoff? The implications beyond solving a narrow problem may be too far-reaching.
2) Minimum GP Quota For Active Roster Players
How it works: The NHL institutes a rule stipulating that a player must play in at least half of the games for which they are active. That wording is important, as it discounts injury. Whatever number of games a player is ready and able to play, they must play in at least 50% of them. If a player is available to you all 82 games, they must play in 41.
Advantages: A rule like this would force coaches to give their healthy scratches some game time. Rather than languish in the press box, players on the NHL roster would be required to get game action.
Disadvantages: This is easy to exploit. Like really, really easy. Teams could place a player on IR or suggest they left the team for vague "personal matters" in order to reduce the quota. After all, they're not "active" for the game, so why should it count? In extreme circumstances, you may see a player on LTIR with a mystery injury, a la Stephane Robidas.
Much like the first proposal, this is a great idea to get the specific group of players we're looking at some playing time, but the implication is that it would create a rule for the remaining 99% of the league that teams would be able to- and definitely try to- circumvent. What's the point of a rule we know teams are going to try and bend?
3) Under-25 Waiver Compensation
How it works: Note that almost all of the players mentioned above, like Corrado, are under the age of 25 but still waiver-eligible. Rather than affect waiver eligibility, why not set up a compensation mechanism? If a player under 25 is put on waivers, a team has to provide compensation- either financial, or a draft pick/prospect- to that team on a sliding scale based on that player's games played/production in the NHL.
Advantages: You've dealt with the obvious problem recurring in front offices: the fear of losing a player for nothing. At least if you risk exposing a young asset to waivers, you'll get something in return if another team claims him.
Disadvantages: Chances are whatever compensation would be fair for a waiver claim wouldn't be enough to deter teams. If it were financial compensation, richer teams like the Leafs certainly wouldn't balk at throwing what amounts to chump change at another franchise to get their player. If it's a draft pick, it would be doubtful it'd be something higher than, say, a 4th rounder. Any sane team would give up a lottery ticket for a player not likely to ever play an NHL game for a player that's already cracked the NHL.
You could make the compensation steeper, but the problem is that this would entirely defeat the purpose of waivers. The concept of waivers is to provide bubble players an opportunity to get an NHL roster spot on another team before being sent to the AHL. Does anyone think that's going to happen if the asking price is a high pick, prospect, or roster player? The end result is that these players would practically lose their chance to catch on with another NHL team.
4) Long-Term Conditioning Loan (LTCL)
How it works: The best tool at the disposal of teams for these players has been the conditioning loan, as it allows them to play in the AHL for two weeks without exposure to waivers. The problem is that once those two weeks are up, the player just returns to the pressbox. They can't be loaned again. That's it.
So, why not expand it?
Let's say that in the event a player has not played an NHL game in fourteen days, the team can loan them to their AHL affiliate, without waivers, for a 30-day period. Let's also extend the number of times you can use this tool: every player will be entitled to four LTCLs per season if they meet the criteria.
Advantages: This idea takes the best existing method of getting "milk carton" players some playing time, and expands it. Unlike the other proposals, it wouldn't have far-reaching implications beyond the players we're trying to help.
And it would work. Think of it in terms of Frank Corrado. The season started on October 7. Under the proposed rule, they would be allowed to go to the Marlies on October 21, with their LTCL ending on November 19. Had this option been available, Corrado could have played 12 games with the Marlies, five more than they played on their conditioning loan. And he'd be available to play more.
Still no room on the roster for him? You could send them for a second LTCL as early as December 3. They would get another 13 games with the Marlies before being returned to the Leafs on January 2.
So, using this example, the Leafs could've used the LTCL to get Corrado 25 games by New Year's Day, compared to the just 7 they got under a regular conditioning stint. Solves the problem, no?
Disadvantages: A team would still only get four of these a season, so there still would be some logistics as to when to play the LCTL card. In the interim, a player would still spend two weeks in the NHL, sitting in the pressbox. It's *better* than the current system, but the problem persists, if only for two-week increments.
Teams could also use it to essentially yo-yo a bubble player to the AHL for almost an entire season without waivers. That's well and good if a player wants to play anywhere, but what if they want an NHL spot? That's the point of waivers, remember.
There's also a logistical issue of the 23-man roster. How do you count a player on LTCL? If they count against the roster, that could be problematic for injuries, particularly if the NHL or AHL club is on a long road trip. If they don't, then how is they replaced? Are you calling up a young player from the Marlies just to take their seat in the pressbox for a month? It's shuffling deck chairs, to an extent.
My Choice
If I had to choose, I think the LTCL would be the best option. I would also add two caveats:
A roster player who has not played a game in 14 days in which they are active must either play in that team's next game, or be put on LTCL.
A player who has played no more than 3 games in 28 days in which they are active must be put on LTCL.
The purpose of this is to force teams to either play a player, or send them to the AHL. If it's been two weeks since they've played, they're getting game action one way or another. To avoid teams giving players a ceremonial one game every two weeks, they will be forced to burn an LTCL on a player if they're not getting the equivalent of a game a week over a four-week period.
Which proposal would you think is best? Answer in the polls.
The announcement of the PlayStation 4 may have passed, but plenty of questions pertaining to the upcoming console remain unanswered. New details are emerging by the hour, and Joystiq has learned that while the PS4 will offer 4K output for video, the same cannot be said for games. This has its pros and cons, of course, notably that while you're not going to be forced to spend big bucks on a gleaming new 4K TV, it also means you're not going to be seeing games run at that incredibly high resolution, at least not yet.
The PlayStation has long since been a console to push the masses through the digital door and introduce them to newer technologies, particularly when it comes to video. The PlayStation 2 played native DVDs, and the fact its successor, the PlayStation 3, came with its very own Blu-ray drive was seen as a big factor in the format's eventual defeat of the rivaling HD DVD media format.
By offering 4K video output, those looking for Ultra HD (UHD) viewing can do so, while the rest won't need to feel coerced into buying another television set. It may well prove to be a delaying of the inevitable, although there's currently divided opinion as to whether UHD will take the world by storm as HD has done over the past ten or so years.
We all enjoy looking at OLED 4K displays at CES, but appreciating a product and purchasing it for our living rooms are two entirely different ball games. Prices for the larger, 80-inch models are sky high, knocking on the doors of $20,000, and although there are set to be more “affordable” ranges at the lower end of the scale (50-inch models for around $2,500), that's still five times the price of a cheap 1080p model on Amazon.
Like 3D, 4K will likely be something some people choose to purchase, while the vast majority stick with 1080p HD. It is, in some respects, disappointing that games will not support 4K, but it is something that we could still see in the not-so-distant future.
The PlayStation 4 will be released, according to Sony, in time for the holiday season.

What would you do with an unknown stranger in a dark room? Say hello? Get friendly? A bit more than that? Well psychologist Ken Gergen decided to find out in 1973 and then in 2012. What happened?
Here I go watching another Discovery Channel program last night on sexual mores in the US today, from the Kinsey Institute no less. I think they saved the best for last, because at the end they decided to do a rerun of social psychologist Ken Gergen's famous (or maybe infamous) experiment with students in 1973, that saw them put in a dark room with no instructions, along with others of both sexes, who were not known to them. Strangers in the dark. I remember as a psychology undergrad, you have to get a certain number of hours up, being guinea pigs in various studies. Now completing boring old surveys doesn't really compare. This was the 70's folks.....the permissive era, communes, Hustler magazine, sensitivity groups, Fellini Satyricon, Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice. What do you think happened to these completely anonymous strangers? A love in? An orgy? Well not quite, but things did get personal.
At first they talked, but then the conversation soon slacked off. Then the touching began. Almost 90% of subjects touched someone else on purpose. More than half hugged someone. A third ended up kissing. Almost 80% of the men and women reported feeling sexually excited. They also reported it was a bonding experience in terms of in-group feeling and several of the participants offered to come back as unpaid extras in the future (apparently there must have been a small financial incentive). The one thing that didn't happen was any animosity between them. No argy-bargy. It promoted good feelings. Altogether it would probably qualify as a type of love-in without actual sex.
Now the same experiment was performed by Ken and psychologist wife Mary for the cameras of Discovery Channel. This time participants locations could be detected by thermal imaging equipment. They entered one by one and the same slightly apprehensive conversations began:- " Hey I don't want to trip people over here." "Wow I thought this was a porno" etc. Then......nothing. After lying in more or less separate spaces for around 30 minutes, so everyone had enough room, there was one reported incident of touching, but only to say:- "Hey, feel the hole in my wrist. This was the result of an accident that happened when I got this tattoo." Pretty much zilch in terms of intimacy after and it came to an end some 60 mins later. This didn't turn into another 'Big Brother' episode. There were no exhibitionists 'wanna be' stars here.
Now what does it say about us now? A lot? A little, but the situation was too artificial? Or something else? Now you need to know what Ken Gergen was famous for besides this. They put forward their famous 1973 paper on :- 'Social psychology as history'. They argued behaviuor patterns could be altered by their historical context and simply by studying them. eg. if you study obedience to authority, it would reduce the likelihood of obedience. Descartes might have said :- "I think therefore I am" but Gergen said :- "I am linked therefore I am." So when the Discovery interviewer said to Ken :- "Can you explain this behaviour we just saw?" They said :- "Well, you know, that first time was back in the 70's, and they didn't have sexual harrassment laws and such, so people felt freer. "
But is this all? I think not, but I want to hear what you think. This is a sort of experiment itself. So, don't be just another page view, speak you mind. Remember we didn't have the big, bad, impersonal web then. What has really become of us?

Part of my job when I speak about politics is to speak up for black people and say things black people need said. This mission has rarely felt so necessary as it has when racial code words recently entered the Presidential election. These code words are ancient racial stereotypes in slick, modern gear. They are linguistic mustard gas, sliding in covertly, aiming to kill black political viability by allowing white politicians to say ‘Don't vote for the black guy' in socially-acceptable language. Sometimes the code comes directly out of a candidate's mouth. Sometimes it comes from supporters, or can be found in advertisements.
(MORE: Inside the Racist Mind)
Do not be fooled by the canard that both parties do it. That was former RNC Chairman Michael Steele's response when I asked them about it on my MSNBC show “The Cycle.” Using certain words to invoke racialized fear and scare white working class voters is a long-established part of the Republican playbook. The GOP is a 90% white party and has been for decades. According to Ron Brownstein of the National Journal, Mitt Romney will need over 60% of white people to vote for them or they will lose. “That,” Brownstein says, “would be the best performance ever for a Republican Presidential challenger with that group of voters.” Given that math, in a base turnout election where Romney has a big lead among white, non-college educated men, it's understandable why he'd try to motivate those voters with code words that remind them of their racial difference with Obama and stigmatize that difference. In this effort a word like “welfare” is extremely valuable. Sure there are more white than black Americans on welfare, but when a candidate says ‘welfare' many whites think of their tax dollars being given to blacks.
So when Romney began running ads about Obama “dropping the work requirement from welfare” — ads which are still running even though the claim has been thoroughly debunked — they were merely updating Ronald Reagan's old “welfare queen” meme. Both are designed to create racial resentment around entitlements. This tactic is bolstered by the classic stereotype of blacks as lazy. A recent Pew Research Center poll, for example, found that 57% of Republicans believe people are poor because they don't work hard. When a recent Washington Post poll asked “Why do most black voters so consistently support Democrats?” the second reason given by Republicans was “black voters are dependent on government or seeking a government handout” while for Democrats it was that “their party addresses issues of poverty.” (The top answer for members of both parties was “Don't know”.)
(MORE: Romney Plays the Race Card)
Another classic code word — that hasn't cropped up in this election yet — is “crime.” Like welfare, even though more whites commit crimes than blacks, the word is more associated with blacks who have historically been stereotyped as wild, violent, animalistic and immoral. As Michelle Alexander writes in The New Jim Crow, “What it means to be criminal in our collective consciousness has become conflated with what it means to be black, so the term white criminal is confounding, while the term black criminal is nearly redundant.” The classic example is President George H. W. Bush's famous ad using inmate Willie Horton as a way to portray Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis as soft on crime and thus unable to protect us from wild black criminals.
There's also the cornucopia of terms and concepts created to de-Americanize Barack Obama, from calling them “Muslim” or “Socialist” to Romney surrogates like John Sununu saying things like, “I wish this President would learn how to be an American.” There is also a return to birtherism, with Romney recently joking, “Nobody's ever asked to see my birth certificate.” The subtext of all this is: Obama, like other blacks, is not one of “us.”  They are other.
Do Democrats use racial code? No. The Democratic party is a racially diverse coalition. There would be no value to playing this game. In fact, the party has risked alienating white working class voters by fighting for people of color, a tightrope perhaps best symbolized by President Johnson signing the 1964 Voting Rights Act and then famously, and presciently, saying to an aide, “We have lost the South for a generation.”
(MORE: Will Black Voters Punish Obama For Their Support of Gay Rights?)
If Johnson could see the modern electoral college map they would recognize their continuing impact in a solid red South, but many say that a white-dominated political party leaning on racial appeals to survive will not work much longer. The Hispanic population in America is rising rapidly and as Brownstein points out, “Whites have declined as a portion of the electorate in every presidential election since 1992, according to exit polls.” Those are two frightening trends for the future of the GOP and even prominent Republicans are publicly admitting it. “The demographics race we're losing badly,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina recently told the Washington Post. “We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.”
But for now, as the GOP paddles furiously trying to stay viable as an all-white party, we must shine a harsh light on their attempts to use old racial stereotypes to win votes.
This animation portrays the flow of atmospheric water vapor around the world. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as feedback to the climate. Credit: NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio. Imagine trying to figure out your car's fuel economy by driving only 20 miles. Sure, the number might look pretty good, but it wouldn't be a very accurate picture of how your vehicle burns fuel over the long term.
Predicting how the climate will change is a bit more complicated than calculating miles per gallon, but scientists who estimate Earth's future temperatures face a similar challenge—having enough data to see the big picture.
The big goal is to gauge how the atmosphere responds to changes, and to fully understand the long-term trends, you'd better understand the short-term trends really well. - Eric Fetzer, project scientist
“The big goal is to gauge how the atmosphere responds to changes, and to fully understand the long-term trends, you'd better understand the short-term trends really well,” said Eric Fetzer, a project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
In 2002, NASA launched the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard its Aqua satellite, designed to make precise measurements of global temperatures, greenhouse gases and clouds. Now that the instrument has amassed 12 years of data, researchers are using its cutting-edge observations to better understand how climate feedbacks will impact warming rates.
Water vapor: The hot and cold cycles of El Niño
When it comes to global climate, one of the strongest triggers of short-term variability is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Normally, most of the Earth's warm water is concentrated in a deep pool in the western Pacific. But every three to five years, El Niño makes its appearance, bringing warm water to the surface and making the tropical Pacific Ocean warmer than average. (Conversely, during La Niña, sea-surface temperatures become colder than normal.)
Launched into Earth-orbit on May 4, 2002 aboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, AIRS, moves climate research and weather prediction into the 21st century. Credit: NASA. Learn more about AIRS.
For climate researcher Andrew Dessler, El Niño isn't just a weather phenomenon to be studied—it's a rough analogue to the Earth's long-term warming and cooling cycles. “If I want to understand how water vapor responds to climate change, I need to look at a time when the Earth is cold and a time when the Earth is warm,” said Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University.
As a potent greenhouse gas, water vapor plays a key role in global climate: As temperatures rise, water vapor increases, and because water vapor is itself a greenhouse gas, this produces even more warming. This vicious cycle is known as feedback. By looking at the AIRS water vapor data during both the cold and warm cycles of the ENSO (El Niño and La Niña), Dessler can see how water vapor levels are responding to temperature changes and calculate the strength of the water vapor feedback.
“If the globe warmed seven-tenths of a degree during the last El Niño, I can see in the AIRS data how water vapor changed in response to that. This tells me a lot about how water vapor is going to interact with climate change,” they said.
Now that AIRS has 12 years of data, Dessler is able to measure water vapor at all altitudes of the lower atmosphere during several El Niño cycles. “Water vapor doubles the amount of warming you get from CO 2 alone, so it's really this very significant effect,” they said. “If you have only three years of data, you really don't know if what you're seeing in the atmosphere is representative of the longer-term picture.”
Clouds: Using the present to predict the future
While water vapor has a powerful effect on the climate system, the role that clouds play in affecting climate change is not well understood. “Models all predict that the water vapor effect doubles the amount of warming, but we're still pretty uncertain about how clouds amplify warming,” said Hui Su, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Low clouds can shelter the Earth like an umbrella, reflecting solar radiation back to space and producing a net cooling effect. But high clouds can act like a blanket over the planet, triggering a greenhouse (warming) effect. The big conundrum for climate modelers is, how much cloud cover will there be in the future? The answer to that question is directly related to humidity.
“More moisture in the atmosphere means more cloud cover,” said Su. “Based on the AIRS data, we know what the current humidity should be, and that should predict the amount of clouds,” said Su. “So, we're really using current observations to infer the realism of model predictions.”
It's kind of an ‘inconvenient truth'—the models that are realistic all happen to be the ones that are predicting a very strong warming in the future. - Hui Su, research scientist
In a recent study, Su and their research team used AIRS observations of humidity to analyze the performance of 15 leading global climate models. What they found was surprising: Only five of the models reproduced humidity levels that matched the current range observed by AIRS and other instruments. Even more startling, those models that did accurately forecast current humidity were the ones that predicted a much warmer future climate—about .7 degrees C (1.3 degrees F) higher than the average warming predicted by all 15 models combined.
“It's kind of an ‘inconvenient truth'—the models that are realistic all happen to be the ones that are predicting a very strong warming in the future,” said Su.
According to Fetzer, Su's findings beg two important questions: “First, why are we looking at models that don't accurately produce what we're experiencing today? And second, if the models that are accurately forecasting humidity say that future warming is going to be closer to 4 degrees C than 1.5 degrees C, shouldn't we be concerned?”
CO 2 is the big control knob just like the guy playing guitar is making the music, but it's the amplifier that makes it loud. The guitar player by themselves can't blow your eardrums out. - Andrew Dessler, climate researcher
There is indeed reason for vigilance, if not concern. According to Dessler, only about one-third of the warming predicted for the future will come directly from CO 2 ; the rest will result from feedback effects—like water vapor and clouds. “CO 2 is the big control knob,” Dessler said, “just like the guy playing guitar is making the music, but it's the amplifier that makes it loud. The guitar player by themselves can't blow your eardrums out.”
Despite their complexity, climate models are the most robust tools we have for estimating Earth's future temperatures. But can we be confident that their estimates of the “amplifier” effects are accurate? The best way to assess that, says Fetzer, is to evaluate their ability to forecast current conditions.
“We need to come up with a set of stringent observational requirements that models must meet, and the basic prerequisite is that they are able to reproduce current reality—that's just logic,” said Fetzer. “That's really why we need to look at 10-plus years of data.”
A supermarket in Shipley where a woman killed themselves this morning has re-opened.
The woman, said to be aged between 20 and 40, died at Asda shortly after 8.30am.
One female witness said the tragedy happened at the top of the hardware aisle where the woman was found lying in a pool of blood.
"One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR," said the witness, who asked not to be named.
"One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing themselves in the throat. He's in terrible shock.
The shopper said they were told that the woman had taken a knife from a rack in the hardware department, torn it out of the packaging and then stabbed herself.
Emergency services were called to Asda at 8.37am to reports that the woman had suffered a neck wound.
They were later pronounced dead at the scene.
The store was closed this morning as police forensic teams examined the scene.
Police are interviewing staff and witnesses and also studying in-store CCTV.
Detective Inspector Ryan Bragg of Bradford District CID said: "There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances and no one else is being sought in connection with the incident."
A spokesperson for Asda said: "We are aware of an incident in our Shipley store this morning and our thoughts are with the individual's family at this time. Our priority at this time is looking after our colleagues and supporting the police in their investigation."

Yemen Security Brief
President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government claimed that a plane carrying “tens of billions” of Yemeni riyals printed in Russia arrived at Aden International Airport on June 1. The Hadi government stated that it will use the money to pay salaries. It reported on a similar shipment on January 6 but did not pay salaries at that time. The Hadi government and al Houthi-Saleh bloc have not paid public sector salaries for roughly nine months.[1]
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) militants attacked al Houthi-Saleh forces in Taiz city, central Yemen on May 31. AQAP snipers killed al Houthi-Saleh troops guarding a military camp near the Presidential Palace and al Salal hill in eastern Taiz city. AQAP acknowledged an attack in Taiz for the first time since November 2016, though AQAP militants have fought in Taiz throughout the intervening period. AQAP militants fight alongside the Abu Abbas brigade, a Salafi militia backed by the Saudi-led coalition that is leading an offensive to seize the Presidential Palace and surrounding area from al Houthi-Saleh forces.[2]
AQAP released a five-minute video about a May 10 suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED) attack on a Hadhrami Elite Forces base in Daw'an district, Hadramawt governorate, eastern Yemen. AQAP characterized the attack as revenge for crimes committed by the Hadhrami Elite Forces and framed the operation as the start of a “new phase” of AQAP's fight against Emirati-backed forces in Hadramawt governorate.[3]
Yemeni Prime Minister Ahmed Obaid bin Daghir and Minister of Information Moamar Mutahar al Iryani called on the Yemeni media to refrain from criticizing members of the Saudi-led coalition on June 1. The statement may be a response to the Yemeni media's criticism of Qatar and coverage of the feud between Qatar and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in late May.[4]
Al Houthi-Saleh forces claimed to launch “Zilzal-2” ballistic missiles at Hadi government forces stationed in Mawza district, western Taiz governorate on June 2, and Nihm district, Sana'a governorate on June 1. Neither attack is confirmed. Al Houthi-Saleh forces use ballistic missiles to slow the Hadi government's advance and strike behind established front lines.[5]
Horn of Africa Security Brief
Al Shabaab claimed responsibility for 13 attacks in Kenya and Somalia in a six-day period on June 1. An al Shabaab-affiliated Telegram account praised the group's attacks on security forces from May 26 through June 1 in a series of posts. The group claimed attacks on Somali National Army (SNA) forces throughout Somalia's Middle and Lower Shabelle regions, Hiraan region, and Lower Juba region. The account also praised attacks on Kenyan forces in Bardhere in Gedo province, central Somalia. The group claimed to kill Ethiopian and Burundian soldiers in attacks throughout Somalia. Al Shabaab attacks on AMISOM contingents aim to prompt foreign forces to withdraw from Somalia.[6]
Somali security forces arrested more than 200 people suspected of supporting al Shabaab in Mogadishu on June 1. Security forces raided homes and businesses linked to suspected supporters and militants as part of an ongoing stabilization mission in the capital. Somali security forces have arrested nearly 250 al Shabaab militants in Mogadishu since the operation began in late May.[7]
Cholera infected more than 1,000 people in Burco town, Togdheer region, northern Somalia. City administrators responded to the outbreak by banning public gatherings and canceling school. Cholera has infected over 40,000 Somalis since December 2016.[8]

PETA is an organization that likes to complain whenever they see something they perceived as cruelty toward animals. Usually, their grievances don't amount to much. But now, the organization seems to have struck a victory. Because of them, Roger Jr., aka the boxing kangaroo, has been removed from the Western version of Tekken 7.
During an interview with VG24/7, executive producer Katsuhiro Harada explained why Roger Jr. has been removed from Tekken 7.
“There was a video of a man's dog in a headlock by a kangaroo, and they punched it in the face. It turned into a big problem. People were complaining about them punching a kangaroo. It seems that in the last few years there's a lot more animal activists—even though they probably wouldn't play our game, they would still hear about that, about a kangaroo in our game being punched, and would complain about it.”
Though Tekken 7 is due to release in the West in June; it has been out in Japan for nearly two years. None of these animal rights activists complained about it then. But now that it's on their radar because it is coming to the West, they find it objectionable. As Harada (rightly) points out, the folks lobbying these complaints would likely never even play a Tekken game yet they still want the game altered to suit their specific agenda.
For those who may be wondering, Kuma the Bear will still be in the game. Harada says the reason for this is that a bear is “obviously stronger than a human being.” One can't really argue with that point. But kangaroos can land some pretty nasty kicks that could kill a person too. But I suppose that is irrelevant to PETA.
Expect Tekken 7 to be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on June 2.
The data also show the success of federal safety-net programs. If not for tax credits for low-income workers, an additional 8.2 million people would have been classified as poor last year. Similarly, food stamps and low-income housing aid lifted 3.6 million and 3.1 million people, respectively, out of poverty last year.
For all the improvement, however, broad prosperity remains elusive. For income gains to meaningfully raise living standards, they would have had to exceed the peak from before the recession, not merely met it. One in eight Americans, 40.6 million people, are still poor. Some 28.1 million are still without health coverage.
And yet, Republican policymakers seem determined to undo the progress that has been made. The Trump administration has opposed Obama-era rules to update the nation's overtime-pay protections for salaried workers, arguably the single most important policy option to raise middle-class pay. President Trump and the House Budget Committee have both issued budget proposals for 2018 that call for deep spending cuts to safety-net programs. This week, the Republican senators Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina plan to introduce yet another draconian bill to end Obamacare.
Those giant steps backward would all shift income up the economic ladder. They would also create fiscal room for big tax cuts for the rich, a grail of Republican policy, despite the poor job and wage growth after the tax cuts of the George W. Bush era.
The result would be greater income inequality, the one measure that did not improve in the new Census data. Income gains at the top far outstripped those at the bottom.
TCU baseball coach Jim Schlossnagle, who signed a contract extension Monday, said they did not talk to Texas or any other school that might have wanted to hire them away from Fort Worth.
“I never spoke with another school, me personally,” they said, calling the interest flattering, but simply the result of a good year. The Horned Frogs completed a 49-18 season with two semifinal losses at the College World Series last week.
“We've built this program to the point where I don't think there's a better job in the country, and that's not a slam on any other place,” Schlossnagle said. “Every place has its unique strengths and obstacles, and we have obstacles here, too. But for me and my family, from a personal side and a professional side, there's never been a better fit. I don't foresee that changing.”

Schlossnagle's name came up immediately when Texas reassigned Augie Garrido on Memorial Day, two days after TCU eliminated the Longhorns at the Big 12 tournament.
Ten days later, TCU athletic director Chris Del Conte and Chancellor Victor Boschini offered Schlossnagle a contract extension, and the parties agreed. The new contract sat unsigned while TCU defeated Texas A&M in three games in a Super Regional series the following weekend and then during the Frogs' 10-day stay in Omaha.
Schlossnagle said except for an issue or two to work out regarding their assistant coaches, there would be no holdup to their signing the deal when the team returned to Fort Worth. They signed it the second day back.
Schlossnagle said it was actually the 10th time in their 13 years at TCU that their six-year contract has been extended or reworked.
TCU is in the midst of its most successful three-year run. Since 2014, the Horned Frogs are 148-51 (.744) with a Big 12 regular-season championship, two Big 12 tournament championships and three College World Series appearances.
“It's a six-year contract, but we will revisit it every year to extend it further,” they said. “Luckily, I've worked for athletic directors that, every time we've had success, it's been rewarded. One of the beauties of working at this place is I've never felt like I've had to fake leverage interest or stuff like that, mainly because of Chris Del Conte and Chancellor Boschini. They stay out in front for all of our coaches.”
Schlossnagle said they are committed to keeping pitching coach Kirk Saarloos and hitting coach Bill Mosiello, whom they called part of “the best coaching staff I've ever been around, both on and off the field,” but they realize they have drawn interest, too.
I'm not going to keep them from going to be a head coach, but we're going to make it really hard for them to leave. Our goal is to try and keep this thing together as long as we can. Jim Schlossnagle, on assistants Kirk Saarloos and Bill Mosiello
“I'm not concerned at all about them going to be an assistant somewhere else,” Schlossnagle said. “Right now, it's about the right head-coaching job, if they aspire to that. The only job we want those guys to leave for is an outstanding job in a Power 5 conference. If they run across that, then we'll certainly wish them well. I'm not going to keep them from going to be a head coach, but we're going to make it really hard for them to leave. Our goal is to try and keep this thing together as long as we can.”
Schlossnagle, whom Saarloos calls “the CEO of TCU baseball,” credited Saarloos and Mosiello for the bulk of the recruiting and noted their contributions to the season.
“I think this year was the best job Kirk's ever done,” Schlossnagle said. “And Mo has done exactly what I asked them to do when I hired him, which was to completely change the mentality of our offense. And we feel like the talent level that we have committed in the next two or three recruiting classes is pretty special. If we can get these guys to campus and integrate them in our system and our culture, the sky's the limit for what we can do.”
67Games played this season for TCU, second-most in program history. The 2010 College World Series team played 68.
No salary information was released, but Schlossnagle is probably near $1 million per year, if not more, as baseball coaching salaries rise around the country. Louisville extended Dan McDonnell for 10 years at more than $1 million per season. Schlossnagle was making more than $765,000 per year, according to TCU's latest tax filing.
Del Conte said Monday that the extension was “all-encompassing,” meaning it covered the assistant coaches, as well.
Asked if they ever thought he'd be among the highest-paid baseball coaches in the country, Schlossnagle said, “No, I've never thought about this kind of things. I've never asked for a raise here. The only thing I've ever asked for is for me and my coaches to be rewarded relative to our success, and all three of our athletic directors have done that.”
Schlossnagle said they still ask only one thing of TCU officials.
“I just want to make sure our players and coaching staff are taken care of at the absolute highest level,” they said. “If they do that, then as they call it in New Orleans, everything else will be lagniappe — just a little something extra.”
Story highlights Congress is debating the future of the Land and Water Conservation Fund
Environmentalists fear pending land conservation projects are at risk if Congress doesn't reauthorize the law
House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop of Utah is a critic of the law, saying it has become a tool for the federal government to simply buy more land
(CNN) Conservatives and conservationists are clashing over the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a 50-year-old program that is suddenly in the middle of a spending battle on Capitol Hill.
The fund uses royalties from offshore oil drilling to help purchase and develop outdoor recreation areas. It's led to the creation of tens of thousands of small projects like parks, beaches, trails, hunting and fishing areas, and baseball fields, in addition to funding bigger conservation projects in national parks and wildlife refuges.
It's one of dozens of policy issues that both sides are haggling over, and leaders are hoping to reach final deal next week.
Despite wide bipartisan support for the program throughout its history, Congress did not reauthorize it for the first time on September 30 due to protests from conservatives who say the fund has become an example of federal overreach.
Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, is the most vocal critic of the law, saying it has evolved into a land-grabbing tool for a federal government that already owns vast amounts of land.

ON JANUARY 1st each year the Centre for the Study of the Public Domain at Duke University fetes Public Domain Day. It is a joyous occasion, celebrating the end of copyright protection for works that at long last leave the bosom of legal monopoly for the commonweal. The centre does, however, temper the elation with an important caveat: while much of the rest of the world may take cheer from mass migration of material to the public domain each year, America has not seen one since the 1970s, nor will it until 2019.
The public domain is a catch-all term for material outside of the strictures of reproductive limits, or for which rights were formally foresworn. The centre promotes a balance between a creator's and the public's interest, says Duke's James Boyle. Mr Boyle, one of the drafters of the set of liberal copyright assignment licences known as Creative Commons, invokes countless studies arguing that tight copyright makes sense over short periods, to encourage creative endeavour, but can be counterproductive if extended too far. Yet rightsholders lobby for greater control (and legislators often oblige them) "even when it turns out that it hurts their interest," says Mr Boyle.

Europe has much to shout about each January 1st because unlike America, its harmonised copyright laws sever the licensing bonds on the January 1st that follows the 70th anniversary of an author's death. Indeed, Public Domain Day was launched as part of the European Union's Communia project concerned with related policy issues. As a result, this year Europeans, and readers in a number of other places, will be able freely to enjoy remarkable works, such as "The Confusions of Cadet Törless" and "The Man without Qualities" by the Austrian author Robert Musil, as well as the allegorical, surrealist oeuvre of Bruno Schulz, a Pole murdered by the Nazis in 1942, including "The Street of Crocodiles" and "The Cinnamon Shops". (The removal of restrictions applies to the originally published editions in the author's native language, not translations, or even, in some cases, later amended versions.)
America chose a different path. In 1978 and 1998 Congress extended, reshaped and expanded copyright durations and the scope of copyright for existing and future works (see Peter Hirtle's authoritative website for the gory details). For new works produced after January 1st 1978, the period of protection is the same as in the EU. But for works published from 1923 to 1977 for which copyright was properly registered and renewed (as applicable in the period when originally registered or created), copyright was prolonged to a full 75 years from publication regardless of the author's presence among the living. (Work by employees for a company or for which copyright has been entirely assigned to a firm, so-called "work for hire", has a different set of rules.)
In 1998 this was extended to 95 years, partly thanks to lobbying efforts by Disney. It wanted to prevent the first Mickey Mouse film, "Steamboat Willie", from entering the public domain. According to the old rules, the animation, released in 1928, would have been free to reproduce, modify and sell on January 1st 2004. Disney is a conspicuous and prolific user of the public domain, Mr Boyle notes, while remaining one of the most ardent defenders of keeping its own material out of it.
Mr Boyle says the 95-year rule applied to older works made little sense. If copyright is assigned, in keeping with the American constitution, to "promote the progress of science and useful arts", extending it to people who had no expectation of long-term gains (and many of whom were, in fact, dead when the law was passed) would have needed to provide a retrospective incentive to create the works in the first place.
Duke's centre thus uses January 1st to tell Americans what they would be enjoying ready access to be the pre-1978 rules (a term of 28 years renewable in writing for another 28 years) still in place. The list includes volumes by Winston Churchill, Philip K. Dick's "Minority Report", Alfred Hitchcock's 1956 remake of "The Man Who Knew Too Much" and Johnny Cash's composition (though not recordings of) "I Walk the Line".
In 2019 American law will release published works of all kinds registered up until the end of 1923. Unless, that is, the copyright regime changes again. That would not surprise Jennifer Jenkins, who heads the Duke centre. The last extension, the Sonny Bono Act of 1998, met with little dissent (and mostly celebrity testimony). Congress passed the bill unanimously, in part to honour Bono, a fervent defender of Hollywood and the notion of perpetual copyright who had died a few months earlier. That said, Ms Jenkins points to last year's concerted opposition to SOPA and PIPA bills, viewed by many as giving all manner of rightholders too much control, as a sign that the advocates of the public domain will not give up without a fight.
The NHTSA had volunteers drive a test track in cars with automatic lane departure correction, and then interviewed the drivers for their impressions. Although the report does not describe the undoubted look of horror on the examiner's face while interviewing one female, 20-something subject, it does relay the gist of their comments.
After they praised the ability of the car to self-correct when they drifted from their lane, they noted that they would love to have this feature in their own car. Then, after a night of drinking in the city, they would not have to sleep at a friend's house before returning to their rural home.
From CSV. The Peltzman effect doesn't mean that improvements in safety are always negated but it does remind us that we can never ignore the human response.

Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud platform established in 2006, is almost a decade old, and so Amazon thinks that now is the time for AWS to be launched in a much bigger scale and cover more of the cloud market.
At Amazon's re:Invent conference last week, Amazon made it clear that it will be expanding AWS and offering better alternatives for businesses that are currently subscribed to data solutions from the "old-guard" providers, which is a reference to Oracle.
"Two of the fastest-growing services in the history of AWS is Amazon Redshift, which is our data warehouse service, and Amazon Aurora, which is our database engine that we announced last year at re:Invent," said Andy Jassy, AWS head, in an interview with CNBC. "Both of those databases are at least as performing as the 'old-guard' commercial-grade databases but at a tenth of the cost of those 'old-guard' providers."
Jassy added that the adoption and traction of both services are astounding. They also noted that database space is one of the slowest facets of the technology industry in terms of moving into the cloud. The AWS head elaborates that the slow migration to cloud-based database solutions means that a lot of clients are still paying high prices for database space and services from the old-guard providers.
Futhermore, Jassy highlights that AWS has "doubled down" on database space throughout the recent years. They also explained that the company's new offerings are very scalable, flexible and cost-effective since they've been built around the cloud.
"Our goal is to have every company run all of their businesses and all of their applications on top of our technology infrastructure platform," Jassy concluded.
AWS has over a million active clients. It is projected to rake in $7 billion of revenue for 2015 with a billion coming just from its database service offerings.
Recently, AWS has also launched QuickSight, a business intelligence or data analytics service that grants customers a graphic visualization of data.

GHC uses GMP to implement the Haskell arbitrary-precision Integer type. It's been this way for ages.
For various reasons using GMP is a slight problem for some users. Some users don't really make use of Integer and don't like to have to link to GMP. Since GMP uses the LGPL, if you want to ship closed source programs then you have to link to it dynamically. On Windows static linking is the default so you have to jump through hoops to link it dynamically. Then there are also users who make heavy use of GMP and find that the Integer library is far too limited an interface to GMP. However binding extra GMP functions is complicated by the the way that the GHC RTS uses it already (especially the memory management).
So what these people want is a way to build GHC such that the RTS does not directly link to GMP. Then the implementation of Integer should be in a library that is replaceable so that one can use a simple slow implementation, a super-duper binding to GMP or some other "big num" library.
Daniel Peebles, Ian Lynagh and I have been working on this problem recently. Ian and my contributions to this are supported by the IHG.
Getting GMP out of the RTS
Before we can think about replacements however we need to disentangle GMP from the RTS and at least move the existing GMP-based Integer implementation into a library. This Integer implementation would remain the default so it still has to be fast. Daniel has managed to rip GMP out of the RTS and we're now focusing on how to move the GMP binding into its own library.
The difficulty of moving it out of the RTS is that currently almost all the GMP operations are bound as GHC "primops", as opposed to using the FFI. This is partly historical accident (FFI arrived on the scene relatively late) and partly that due to certain FFI restrictions, the primop route is simpler and faster. The issue is that the wrapper code (around the actual GMP calls) needs to return several results to Haskell land, in particular things like (# Int, ByteArray# #) . Using the FFI it is possible to return several results but one has to do it in the time-honoured tradition of C and emulate "out" parameters by passing pointers. The problem with doing that is we would need to do a lot of marshaling: temporarily allocate some memory, pass pointers and read back the results. All this just to return a few integers and pointers. It's actually more tricky because at the level in the library stack where we have to implement Integer we do not actually have access to the FFI libraries (in fact currently we do not even have access to the IO type).
GHC primops
Primops bypass the single-result restrictions inherited from the C calling convention. We can write primops that directly return unboxed tuples, like (# Int, ByteArray# #) . Primops (at least out-of-line primops) are implemented in Cmm, which is GHC's low level intermediate language based on the C-- language. These Cmm functions have to know exactly the internal calling convention that GHC uses, but there is no excess marshaling.
Unfortunately knowledge of the primops has to be baked into the compiler and the Cmm code has to be compiled into the RTS. So that's no good for implementing Integer a separate library from the RTS.
What if we could use the FFI to import Cmm functions...
foreign import prim
That would make it possible to have out-of-line primops in a library. The library would contain the compiled .cmm files and the .hs code in the same library would " foreign import " the cmm function. In particular we could then just move the .cmm code we use for wrapping the GMP library calls from the RTS into the integer-gmp package. Then instead of getting primops like plusInteger# from the GHC.Prim module, we would just foreign import them, eg:
foreign import prim "plusInteger" plusInteger# :: Int# -> ByteArray# -> Int# -> ByteArray# -> (# Int#, ByteArray# #)
So that's what I started implementing today, " foreign import prim ". It needs a slight extension in the lexer, parser, type checker, desugarer, core->stg, and stg->cmm phases. That sounds like a lot but the changes in each bit are pretty small. As a feature it is very similar to foreign C calls and also to primops, so fortunately it can share most code with those existing features. So far it's going ok, I've got it producing convincing looking core, stg and cmm code. Tomorrow I'll test it and review the design and changes with Simon Marlow.
We might well call the last couple of years the Era of the Grand Reform.
When financial crises pushed America to the brink of catastrophe, the idea of incremental political change and improvement became utterly old-fashioned on both sides of the political divide. Barack Obama rode a tide of voter anger to office and promptly launched the most ambitious overhaul of the American health-care sector since HillaryCare notoriously failed in 1993-4. Democrats in Congress married that to a massive expansion of regulations aimed at reining in Wall Street financial institutions.
Not to be outdone, Republicans took back the House in their largest midterm victory since FDR, promising sweeping changes in spending, and immediately proposed equally ambitious changes in entitlement structure and budget reforms. Later this month, Washington will face the latest in budget brinksmanship with yet another self-imposed deadline for a deficit-reduction package that could hold significant ramifications for the American economy – just as the previous deadlines did on the FY2011 budget and on the debt ceiling.
In this age of all or nothing, will a smaller compromise bill intended to improve the job-creation environment garner any attention – or even a vote? We will shortly discover the answer to that question, thanks to an odd-couple partnership in the Senate focused on finding a small patch of common ground on economic growth.
The pairing of first-year student Senators Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, has no small amount of irony. Their elections in 2010 generated some of the most vitriolic partisanship of the midterm cycle from both sides. Rubio was cast as a Tea Party crazy far out of the mainstream on the Right, while Coons got painted as a Marxist far out of the mainstream on the Left. Both ran against colorful candidates with plenty of media exposure – Coons against Christine O'Donnell, who had to run an ad to claim “I'm not a witch,” and Rubio against the literally colorful former Governor Charlie Crist. If anyone in 2010 had to pick the two Senators most likely to pair up for a common-ground approach on economics, Rubio and Coons would have been far down the list.
Yet this week the two announced their AGREE Act (American Growth, Recovery, Empowerment, and Entrepreneurship), primarily aimed at incremental improvements in the economic environment for small businesses. It consists of proposals that both Republicans and Democrats have largely accepted and avoids areas of philosophical and political confrontation, although the compromise touches on larger areas where advocates insist on sweeping reform. For instance, on taxes, the AGREE Act extends tax credits for capital purchases that will expire otherwise. On regulatory relief, it waives some Sarbanes-Oxley requirements for smaller businesses where the compliance burden is both heavy and unneeded. Rubio and Coons also addresses immigration with changes in legal immigration restrictions to permit greater flexibility for visa issuance that eliminates per-country quotas. That would allow the U.S. to attract the best and brightest regardless of their country of origin, while keeping the overall cap in place.
The components of the AGREE Act are relatively modest and seem like common sense. When I asked Senator Rubio about these proposals being “low-hanging fruit” in a political sense, they agreed, although they pointed out that the proposals will make a real difference for people in the economy. If Congress could pass a broad reform of the corporate tax code, Rubio said he'd prefer that over this bill – but Congress won't pass one in this session, and meanwhile, real people need real relief.
More than that, Rubio said, Americans need a reason to think that they will see improvement soon. “If we can pass something that is bipartisan,” Rubio said, “people will look to Washington and see a glimmer of hope. Maybe there is reason for optimism. …What's holding back American creativity right now is the fear that tomorrow is going to be worse than today, and next year worse than this year.”
That, however, is the question at hand, and the AGREE Act is the test that might provide an answer. Will this Congress find a way to act on an incremental economic reform whose components attract wide bipartisan support – or will the politics of the Grand Reform Era keep it from getting a vote in the Senate?
It's no secret that Barack Obama wants to position themselves in the 2012 race as the man who can stand up to a “do-nothing Congress,” hoping to emulate Harry Truman's surprise win in 1948. Majority Leader Harry Reid has stalled 15 House bills aimed at improving the environment for job creation as a way to protect Obama's strategy and to force the House to accept the president's second attempt at a stimulus package instead. The passage of the AGREE Act would undermine that strategy, as well as expose the partisan calculations of Obama's jobs bill.
Rubio understands this, but thinks that their partnership with Coons could crack the roadblock in the upper chamber. “I see an opportunity to do something that is true to my principles,” Rubio told me. “What I'm hoping is that the White House will get on board.
“They've been hoping to run against a do-nothing Congress, so maybe they're not excited about Congress actually acting on something like this,” they said, adding, “There are things that are more important than someone's re-election.”
Perhaps. If the AGREE Act makes it to the floor of the Senate, we will see how many people on Capitol Hill share that view.
(Natural News) Conservatives, libertarians and truth-seekers of all sorts should be very concerned that Snopes is considered one of the authorities on fact-checking, when their liberal bias shines through almost every single day. Whether it be claiming that leftist agendas are false or proclaiming that there is no proof that conservatives have ever done anything positive, Snopes.com doesn't even appear to be trying to keep their reporting unbiased.
This has never been more obvious than in their recent coverage of John Kerry, the State Department and the “charity” operated by Kerry's daughter. They just so happened to pick a fight with the wrong group of journalists. In a Snopes.com article trying to disprove the accuracy of the Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group, the “fact-checkers” claim that TheDCNF's reported that taxpayer dollars were sent to help fund the charity in question. Unfortunately for them, there is proof to back up TheDCNF's claims.
Ethan Barton of The Daily Caller reports, “Snopes.com writer David Emery criticized TheDCNF's reporting nearly three months later in a Thursday article, but presented no evidence that refuted TheDCNF's findings. The so-called ‘investigator of urban legends, rumors, hoaxes & all manner of codswallop,' according to their Twitter bio, also made numerous false statements, starting with the first sentence.”
It should come as no surprise that Snopes tried to throw actual journalists at The Daily Caller under the bus in an attempt to make themselves look more reputable and to protect the reputation of the Democratic Party. This is par for the course when it comes to their corruption, but that doesn't mean that it should be accepted by the American people. For a publication to be passing itself off as the be-all and end-all when it comes to fact-checking, only to be the ones spreading false interpretations of the news is morally bankrupt.
This isn't just some run-of-the-mill website, either. Even Facebook is now considering Snopes.com to be the most reputable outlet out there. They've gone as far as to team up with them to reduce the “fake news” epidemic that is supposedly sweeping the internet. The only problem there is that what Snopes.com considers fake news is most certainly not what the average person considers fake news. The likes of CNN and MSNBC have been pushing news stories that are completely false. What Snopes is really trying to do is silence the alternative media that is attempting to inform the people of the world.
That is the problem…

Technology that lets you avoid lacing your footwear has existed for decades: It's called Velcro. But Nike's HyperAdapt 1.0 sneakers, due to go on sale later this year, offer a much more sophisticated solution. The shoes are outfitted with tiny sensors that detect when wearers slide in their feet, activating a small motor-and-pulley system that automatically draws the laces to a certain degree of tightness based on the size and position of the foot. Buttons next to the tongue allow for easy adjustments depending on user preference and type of activity. But the HyperAdapt is not just about performance and convenience. The shoe is intended to be as engaging as it is technologically impressive. “You can feel it tighten, hear the motor run, and see the laces [move],” says Nike senior innovation engineer Tiffany Beers. “It's a shoe that ignites three senses.”
In a preview of Oliver Stone's documentary “The Putin Interviews,” Russian President Vladimir Putin drops a bombshell. Asked by Stone if they have grandchildren, Putin smiles and answers “yes.”
Questions about Putin's personal affairs are Russian media's most explicit no-go area. The makeup of the country's first family remains a mystery. State media are under strict instructions to never mention Putin's daughters or ex-wife, unless commanded to do so. News outlets that find the courage to investigate, for example, Putin's daughter or their miraculously wealthy husband, paint a target on their own backs.
Barred from asking the question themselves, Russian journalists were obliged to wait until Putin opened up to a complete stranger — a foreigner — to report that they were a happy and loving grandfather.
In the same interview, Putin tells Stone that the Kremlin does not control Russia's media.
The irony will be lost on few Russians. After all, it is the same Vladimir Putin who, in late 2013, signed an executive order to gut the country's leading news agency and appoint a hyper-loyalist TV host as its director. It is the same Vladimir Putin whose aides publicly say journalists working for state-owned outlets are expected to toe the government line.
Stone never challenges Putin on the obvious implausibility of their claim.
When President Obama took office in 2009, they found these three trade deals on their desk. They were previously brokered deals that Democrats had blocked in Congress. Estimates at the time suggested they could create billions of dollars in new export revenue for the United States, and access to these markets would create jobs here at home.
But the president brushed them aside, doing the bidding of the labor union bosses that had backed their campaign. Then earlier this year, as they cobbled together a "jobs plan," they called on Congress to pass these trade agreements—pretending this was a bold new idea. Not only was it not new, it was misleading. Republicans wanted to pass them for years, but the president wouldn't do their part and submit them to Congress.
Even then, President Obama stalled for another month before finally sending those trade pacts to Capitol Hill. Once they're enacted, they'll provide a boost to the economy by making U.S. exports more attractive to foreign consumers. But think about what we've lost while the president delayed.
Based on estimates from the International Trade Commission, the Free Trade Agreement with South Korea could increase U.S. exports by $11 billion annually. Over two and half years, that adds up to over $27 billion Obama effectively robbed from U.S. companies.
In the meantime, the European Union's trade agreement with South Korea took effect. The president stalled to win political points, and America lost jobs, revenue, and opportunity.
But that's just South Korea. In Colombia, the United States missed out on another billion dollars a year. Even Democratic Sens. John Kerry and Max Baucus wrote in April, "Each day we fail to act costs American jobs and sales—and sends them elsewhere." Our unemployment rate is above 9 percent, and Obama's inaction meant we lost jobs to China, Argentina, and Europe as they increased their trade with Colombia.
You would think the president would learn from this mistake. But he's doomed to repeat it once again—and it will cost more jobs. It's a result of their unrealistic and irresponsible demand that their American Jobs Act be an all-or-nothing proposition.
After their September speech to Congress outlining their plan, it became immediately apparent that it would meet bipartisan opposition in Congress. Many of their proposed tax increases had been defeated when Democrats controlled both houses. And even senators in their own party knew their new spending proposals were the same failed policies of the first stimulus.
President Obama ignored that reality and crisscrossed the country for a month demanding Congress "pass this bill right away." They knew it couldn't, but they needed a campaign prop. Republicans, for their part, were ready to work with Democrats on areas of agreement. The president shunned their offers.
On Tuesday, though, the inevitable happened: Democrats and Republicans in the Senate said no to the All-or-Nothing-Jobs-Bill. By the next morning, Democrats were offering to work with Republicans on proposals they could all support. Yet were it not for the president's campaign plans, that work could've started a month earlier. So, how much longer will the president sacrifice the economy for their political ambitions?
The president knows they cannot get re-elected on their record. The economy is flailing, and Americans are hurting. Their only path to victory relies on misrepresentation and cynical political ploys. He's used the American Jobs Act to knock Republicans in hopes of boosting their political prospects. But the truth is Republicans have been working hard for months; they've passed over a dozen bills in the House that would spur job creation. The president and Senate Democrats, though, have sat on their hands.
It's time for President Obama to truly make jobs their number one priority. The campaign can wait. The American people cannot. Republicans want to get this economy moving. There's no more time for the president's self-interested delay tactics.
Better late than never, sure, but "late" is not good enough.

More than 150 years after one of Dallas' earliest pioneers settled the land surrounding Big Spring, the city's Landmark Commission approved a first-of-its-kind historic designation intended to preserve the secluded natural setting for generations to come.
Located off Pemberton Hill Road in southern Dallas, Big Spring is one of the last remaining artesian springs in North Texas that haven't been destroyed by development. Tucked in a grove of oak trees, the spring gushes 10 million gallons of cool, crystalline water into the Trinity River watershed each year.
The commission's vote Monday was a groundbreaking application of the city's landmark preservation process, which is typically used to protect old buildings or neighborhoods. The landmark designation, which still needs approval from the Plan Commission and the City Council, would prevent construction at the site and establish rules governing the installation of fences, trails and signage around Big Spring.
The decision was a major victory for environmentalists and preservationists who have worked to protect the site in recent years, spurred in large part by the development of the adjacent Texas Horse Park.
The land including Big Spring was bought by the city in 2004, but for decades it has been cared for by Billy Ray and Zada Pemberton, who live up the hill from the fount.
Billy Ray Pemberton's grandfather acquired the land in 1880 from Margaret Beeman Bryan, the widow of Dallas' founder, John Neely Bryan.
The site's historical significance and rare natural setting, as well as archaeological evidence of human activity in the area up to 2,500 years ago, helped qualify Big Spring for preservation.
Advocates hope the spring can eventually be opened up to allow public access for educational, recreational and scientific uses.
“This land's significance in our founding is so seminal that it dictates our attention and our city's protection,” former City Council member Veletta Forsythe Lill told the commission. “Any touches to this land must be very light. The space is largely about the water, the topography and the flora.”
The report said death rates of children and expectant women had not declined Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza suffer from an "ailing landscape" of health services, a new study claims. The Lancet medical journal report highlights how 10% of Palestinian children now have stunted growth. The paper describes the healthcare system in the Palestinian territories as "fragmented and incoherent". An Israeli government spokesperson said the Lancet had failed to seek its view, and said many Palestinians had accessed medical care in the country. Mark Regev, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, called the report one-sided. They said: "This is propaganda in the guise of a medical report." Experts from Birzeit University say death rates among children and expectant mothers have failed to decline in recent years. The plateau is in spite of good ante-natal care and high rates of child immunisation. The trend for stunting among children is increasing, and the concern is about the long-term effects
Dr Hanan Abdul Rahim
Birzeit University Dr Hanan Abdul Rahim said: "There are gaps in care. There's a low level of post-natal care and often it's not given in a timely manner. "Mortality rates among infants and under-fives haven't declined much. This is unusual when compared with other Arab countries that used to have similar rates but have managed to bring them down. "The trend for stunting among children is increasing, and the concern is about the long-term effects. It is caused by chronic malnutrition, and affects cognitive development and physical health. "There are pockets in northern Gaza where the level of stunted growth reaches 30%. "It's very important that women and children have access to quality care."

More from BBC World Service Dr Rahim's paper mentions a previously published report from the UN, which says more than 60 Palestinian women have given birth at Israeli checkpoints and 36 of their babies have died as a result. Another paper says the Palestinian health system fails to be effective and equitable. 'Heartbreaking' The conditions of military occupation are blamed, but so is the political instability of the Palestinian Authority - which has appointed six health ministers in three years. Israel as a policy enables and encourages people from all over the world to come to Israel for advanced medical treatment
Unit of Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories spokesperson The lead author, Dr Awad Mataria, also from Birzeit University, said: "Political havoc is one of the reasons for the failure of the health system - but this has been exaggerated and perpetuated under occupation. "Also, the policies of foreign aid donors can be fragmented and contradictory." Dr Mataria's paper note that the Palestinian Authority has received $10bn in recent years - mostly donated by the European Union. But they and their colleagues say health programmes have focused on relief and emergency, rather than on long-term development. In an editorial accompanying the series, the Lancet's editor Richard Horton said: "Our series is not about Arab politics, the status of Israel, or existing conventional diplomatic efforts to broker peace." They added: "The latest storm of violence to engulf Gaza has been heartbreaking to watch, especially for those who have seen first hand the predicaments faced by health professionals trying to maintain a rudimentary, but ultimately failing, health system there." Israeli response An Israeli government spokesperson from the office responsible for coordination with the Palestinian territories said the researchers had failed to get a full picture of health care in the region. They said: "In the two year period supposedly covered by the report over 28,000 Palestinians accessed Israel from the Gaza Strip for medical needs. "Contrary to the indications of the writers, at no time was medical access from Gaza prevented as a policy. "On the contrary, the only time medical aid in Israel was prevented was as a direct result of a Palestinian decision or on limited occasions when the crossing in to Israel was under direct threat and attack." They added: "Israel as a policy enables and encourages people from all over the world to come to Israel for advanced medical treatment it is only natural that our closest neighbour, the Palestinians, enjoy this privilege."

The 2008 financial crisis cost millions of Americans their homes, their jobs and their savings. While many factors contributed to the financial crisis, wrongdoing at financial services firms was one of the main causes. Unscrupulous mortgage lenders wrote trillions of dollars in high-risk loans. Big Wall Street Banks repackaged these bad loans as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and sold them to investors around the world, representing them as safe investments. Big insurers sold trillions in credit default swaps (CDS), allowing for rampant speculation on a plethora of different asset classes.
ADVERTISEMENT
All of these activities were high-risk, high-reward for those who engaged in them. From loan officers who were paid by the number of loans they wrote to Wall Street bankers whose bonuses depended on the volume of CDOs they sold to unwitting investors, to traders whose bonuses depended on the performance of their speculative bets, compensation in the financial services industry incentivized inappropriate risk-taking.
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was written to limit the type of incentive-based compensation in the financial services industry that resulted in the inappropriate risk-taking that helped cause the financial crisis. Six years after the original passage of Dodd-Frank, the regulatory agencies charged with drafting the implementing rule have finally issued a second version of a proposed rule.
Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce submitted a comment opposing the proposed rule, arguing that it is unnecessary and too strict.
The Chamber's comment shows that it has learned none of the lessons of the financial crisis. In the Chamber's Pollyanna view, the American "economy is built to encourage prudent risk taking ... which yield positive externalities like job creation, productivity, and financial stability." And yet nothing was prudent about the speculative orgy of risk, greed and fraud that resulted not in job creation and financial stability, but rather in mass unemployment and financial meltdown.
In the Chamber's alternate universe, regulating incentive-based compensation to ensure that it does not threaten the financial health of financial services firms "might also chill the kind of risk-taking—lending, financing, investing — that spurs economic growth and job creation." Nowhere does the Chamber acknowledge that inappropriate risk-taking and the huge bonuses that incentivized it are what actually chilled lending in the aftermath of the financial crisis and resulted in the worst economic contraction since the Great Depression.
While the Chamber makes many technical arguments against the proposed rule, two are worth mentioning.
First, the Chamber contends that the proposed rule's deferral and clawback provisions are too onerous. Such provisions are designed to discourage inappropriate risk-taking; deferral of incentive-based compensation is designed to encourage executives and managers to pursue sounder, more long-term strategies rather than privileging short-term gains that may allow them to reap huge bonuses while simultaneously imperiling the financial health of their firms and perhaps even the economy as a whole. Clawback provisions allow companies to take back bonus pay that has already been awarded if it turns out that it was originally awarded for strategies that subsequently go south.
The Chamber argues that both the deferral and clawback periods are too long, despite the fact that the proposed rule would allow senior executives to receive 70 percent of their pay within two years. Given that the typical business cycle lasts at least five years and a typical credit cycle lasts even longer, the Chamber's contention that the proposed deferral period is too long is illogical. If a deferral rule is truly to incentivize longer-term strategic thinking, then bonus pay must be deferred through at least one business cycle.
Second, the Chamber argues that restrictions on incentive pay will result in a "brain drain" of "talent" to other industries and other countries. And yet for several decades, far too many of America's best and brightest have gravitated toward Wall Street, lured by the promise of astronomical compensation packages. As a nation, it is this brain drain to Wall Street that should trouble us. We should be concerned that our economic system incentivizes people to work in a sector of the economy that is not among the most socially useful and productive.
What's more, productivity gains in the U.S. have been in a prolonged slowdown. It is worth asking whether excessive bonuses on Wall Street are related to this productivity slowdown. Innovation is one of the primary factors driving productivity growth, and when so many great minds are hoovered up by finance, there are fewer left to innovate in the real economy. One wonders where our nation might be today if Wall Street compensation were more reasonable and more top talent had instead chosen to work in medical research and other socially useful fields. Might we already have succeeded in curing cancer and other deadly diseases?
Attempting to restore some sanity to Wall Street compensation practices is important if we are to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. It also may be an important part of recalibrating our economic system so that top talent is drawn to more diverse sectors of the economy rather than being concentrated on Wall Street. While the Chamber purports to be defending the interests of the broader American economy, its dogged defense of unbridled bonuses on Wall Street proves once again that it is really looking out for the narrow interests of some of its wealthiest donors.

Under-pressure Theresa May finally announced a £5million fund to pay for emergency supplies, food, clothes and other costs tonight.
Victims who lost their homes in the disaster must be rehoused “at the earliest possible opportunity”, and within three weeks at the latest, Downing Street said.
No 10 said the package included “a guarantee to rehouse people as close as practically possible to where they previously lived”.

But crucially there was no pledge to re-home them in Kensington, meaning they could be moved to neighbouring boroughs.
The £5million Grenfell Tower Residents' Discretionary Fund will be distributed by the local authority.
Mrs May and senior ministers drew up the plans after heard “horrific” stories from survivors in hospital.

They said: “I spoke with people who ran from the fire in only the clothes they were wearing.
“They have been left with nothing – no bank cards, no money, no means of caring for their children or relatives.
“One woman told me they had escaped in only their top and underwear.
“The package of support I'm announcing today is to give the victims the immediate support they need to care for themselves and for loved ones.
“We will continue to look at what more needs to be done.
“Everyone affected by this tragedy needs reassurance that the Government is there for them at this terrible time - and that is what I am determined to provide.”
In June of 2003, California's Democratic governor, Gray Davis — faced with a $38.2 billion budget deficit, as big as all the other 49 states combined — announced that they would raise $4 billion by reversing a cut to their state's vehicle registration fees.
Vehicle registration is a mostly progressive fee that is assessed based on the value of the car, but Davis' move ended up tripling the fee the average driver would pay. In a state still reeling from the worst of the dot com bust, the outrage was palpable.
California's Republican Party seized the moment to launch a recall effort personally funded by millionaire Darrell Issa (R-CA) — who has always had a unique interest in cars. Issa, of course, thought they would be the natural replacement for Davis, but Arnold Schwarzenegger joined the race.
The newly elected Governator reversed the fee and ended up growing the deficit to as large as $42 billion in 2009.
A mere four years later, California has a new problem: What to do with the projected $850 million surplus it will have by the end of the year.
We've told you about the worst ideas from the Tea Party governments of Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Texas. So we figured you might be ready for a story with a happier ending. Even though the state is not completely free of problems, it is in vastly better fiscal shape than it has been in more than a decade.
Writer David Dayen has laid out how California's progressives remade the state's politics and corrected those who think Jerry Brown is deserving of most of the credit.
But the steps California's Democratic majority took to erase tens of billions from the deficit and return their state to fiscal sanity are pretty simple. And they can be replicated in other states to overcome Republican obstruction and polices that favor the wealthy at the expense of working families.
Here are five of the best ideas from California's Democrats.

We all know that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. But we all do it anyway. If I were to show you some faces, you'd find it pretty easy to make a snap judgment of –say – how clever they look. But this would just be prejudice, right? You couldn't, just by looking, guess people's actual intelligence. Could you?
Let's try. Below are three men. Rank them in order of intelligence from most to least (these aren't real people, but composites created – in each case – by averaging across lots of difference faces).
And now the same for women.
Scroll down to find out the rankings that most people give.
For the male faces, most people rate the man on the right as the most intelligent, and the man on the left as the least. For the female faces, most people rate the woman on the left as the most intelligent, and the woman on the right as the least (in both cases, the middle faces are in between).
But these are just stereotypes, right? No. When researchers in the Czech Republic asked people to estimate the intelligence of 80 biology students on the basis of facial photographs, a significant correlation was observed between perceived and actual intelligence (as measured by an IQ test); but only for men.
Admittedly, the relationship was small. Statisticians express the relationship between two measures using a number called a correlation coefficient (sometimes abbreviated to r). This number ranges between 0 (i.e., no relationship between face-ratings and IQ-test scores) and 1 (i.e., you can perfectly predict anyone's IQ on the basis of the face-rating). On this scale, the correlation between perceived and actual intelligence for men was tiny[i] – r=0.06 – though easily statistically significant. The concept of statistical significance is explained in detail in the book version of Psy-Q (look for the section The Tea Test), but the take-home message is this: The likelihood of researchers finding an apparent relationship between perceived and actual intelligence of this size (i.e., r=0.06 on the 0-1 scale) by chance alone, if none actually existed, is less than 1 in 1,000.
Two unsolved puzzles remain. First, why is it that we can read intelligence in the faces of men (at least to a modest degree), but not women? Perhaps, in evolutionary terms, giving off signals of intelligence is more important for men than women. Indeed, cross-cultural studies tell us that – pretty much universally – women value intelligence much more than do men when seeking a partner (You can take this “Perfect Partner” test yourself in the book version of Psy-Q, as well as measuring your own IQ, and completing other face-rating tasks looking at trustworthiness, aggression and attractiveness).
Another possibility is that, when asked to rate intelligence in women's faces, the raters (both men and women) couldn't help being swayed by attractiveness (what researchers call a “halo effect”). Indeed, the relationship between rated attractiveness and rated intelligence for female faces was r=0.9 on the 0-1 scale, meaning that the two are almost interchangeable (the corresponding figure for male faces was r=0.5).
The second remaining question is just what features of men's faces raters were using to predict intelligence (which, remember, they were able to do at way above chance levels). The researchers found that, on the whole, faces that were rated as intelligent tended to be long and thin with larger noses, while those that were rated as less intelligent tended to be rounder and fatter with small noses. But, confusingly, when they fed these measurements into the computer, they did not predict IQ-test scores, just perceived intelligence.
So, for now, this second puzzle remains unsolved: We don't know exactly what features people use to correctly predict intelligence in male faces. The researchers speculate that it may be “particular configurations of eyes or gaze, colour of eyes, hair and skin, or skin texture”. What we need now is studies that tease apart these possibilities (for any psychology students reading this, this might be an interesting idea for a 3rd year project, if you can find a suitable supervisor).
In the meantime, the findings of this study suggest that people not only do judge a book by its cover but – to at least some extent – are justified in doing so. So, whilst we don't yet know exactly what this entails, then the lesson – particularly if you are a man – is clear: Look sharp!

Buss, D. M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12, 1–14.
[i] One reason that the effect is tiny is that the researchers had to control for ratings of attractiveness, which is highly correlated with perceived intelligence (r=0.5 for men).
Movie Review: ‘Sing'
by
Director: Garth Jennings
Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Seth MacFarlane, Scarlett Johansson, John C. Reilly, Tori Kelly, Taron Egerton
Plot: When a koala looks to lose their theatre business they decide to set up a singing competitive. Through a typo people think the prize is $100,000 instead of $1000, and hundreds turn up to audition.
Review: You're going to have to deal with my grumpy and cynical film critic attitude for a while, because there are some trends in animated film that have getting my nerves the past few years and Sing appears to have been made entirely from the irksome trends themselves.
If you don't want to read my grumpy rant against a harmless kids film, skip down to the wet pig.
What am I talking about? Well, I have a list.
I wrote an entire article on this one already Casting marketable celebrities instead of voice actors substantially better qualified for the role (). Characters being based on said celebrities instead of being original characters. Throwing in one-hit wonder songs in place of a joke AND/OR chucking in catchy pop songs for positive association. Seth MacFarlane. Pop culture references that will mean nothing to an audience of children.
Now when we saw the trailers for Sing it looked like someone took the above list as a personal challenge. I wasn't looking forward to it, but I took the kids (we'll get to their thoughts on the film later, I'm being bitter) and, well…it was as expected.
First, they have absolutely cast this film with marketing in mind. They've made the cast list prominent in all the marketing. Not to disparage their work, because they are all fine (Taron Egerton is, as usual, a stand out), but there are some amazing voice actors who would've given the movie much more life and character. Of course they couldn't then use the celebrities public image as the template for the characters.
Now for the third point concerning the use of pop music. Look, I know chucking in a one-hit wonder like ‘Baby Got Back' is seemingly enough to generate a weak laugh and a couple of groans from the audience but it's incredibly lazy. There's no set-up, no gag – they just get thrown into animated movies for a reaction. Most of these songs are pretty good, just over played and now treated like a joke. How many random pop songs and one hit wonders does Sing feature?
At least 65 songs that we know and love. Do you what happens when you put 65 songs into a movie that runs less than 2 hours? Most of them get one line each. We literally go from the opening line of ‘The Safety Dance' to the opening line of ‘Baby Got Back' and then on to the next. A Jukebox Musical is a fine idea, and potentially lots of fun, but this is overkill. It cuts through songs faster than Suicide Squad. Hopefully this movie kills this obnoxious trend.
Also it has Seth MacFarlane in it. They play a douche so again it's a character based on the actor (goodness, I'm funny).
Finally, pop culture references that the target audience of children won't understand. There's a niche of films that are only known through their parodies, and animated films re-use them again and again. Illumination Animation must get a tax break for chucking in Saturday Night Fever jokes, because every freak'n time. And I know the rebuttal: the jokes are for the parents. But that's not true either, because I'm a typically aged parent of a 6 and 4 year old and when Flashdance came out I was TWO YEARS OLD. I haven't seen it, so this joke is dated even by my standards.
It's not as stupid as a Ray Liotta cameo in Bee Movie, but still dumb.
So I'm a grumpy sod. What's the movie like on its own merits? It's coming out for Christmas and is fluffy, harmless fun. The characters are possible and they have put together a catchy playlist to amuse the audience. It's not going to challenge you but it's decent entertainment.
Each character gets their own backstory and reason for needing to competition. Some of these are good and quite heartfelt, such as Egerton not wanting to be part of their father's gang of crooks, Johansson as a teen finding it hard to define themselves as an individual and Witherspoon as a mother of 25 trapped in routine. The film would've been stronger if they'd cut the chaff and given these stronger roles more time instead of giving them equal time to MacFarlane's douchebag mouse being a douche who is never redeemed in any way. The story bounces from one disconnected plot thread to another, which is easily the films weak spot. By the time we get to the finale we're clocking almost two hours and kids were definitely fidgeting.
At a time when we're seeing Zootopia, Big Hero Six and Moana promoting a better standard the racial stereotyping used in Sing for cheap laughs really stands out and feels awkward. Russian mafia bears and the perpetually confused and quirky J-Pop foxes are a pretty cheap shot. We don't understand Japanese music! Look how silly they are! Bah.
Being an Illumination animated film, this is pretty standard stuff. Lots of pop culture references, passable animation (although it really bugs me that their nostrils never go anywhere) and fart jokes. If you are of a sunny disposition and find the Minions funny, this is being a crowd pleaser that is quickly forgotten. As for the kids, one like the dancing pigs and one liked the song they recognised from Madagascar 3, but I guess familiarity was an important part of music selection. For a cynical snot like me…

The military wants soldiers who can withstand anything - even the worst and most debilitating wartime injuries. Now Darpa, the Pentagon's far-out research team, is trying to make traumatic injuries more like minor scrapes, patched up to be good as new. Or better.
Darpa's been working on superhuman soldiers for years. They've toyed with cellular mitochondria and pondered putting soldiers on the Atkins diet. In 2006, Darpa launched an ambitious Restorative Injury Repair program, that aims to "fully repair" body parts damaged by traumatic injury.
Earlier this year, researchers funded by that program generated new human muscle that could replace damaged tissue. Now Darpa's asking for a device that can use adult stem cells for a regenerative free-for-all, pumping out whatever needed to repair injured body parts, including nerves, bone and skin. Already, research has proven that adult stem cells can act the same way embryonic ones do - differentiating into the highly-specified cells that form complex body parts.
According to Darpa's solicitation, 85 percent of recent wartime injuries involved damage to the extremities and facial regions. That often means multiple surgeries, rehab and permanent disability for vets. They're hoping to eliminate the injuries, and their long-term consequences, with a system that can reproduce* in vitro* tissues with the same structural and mechanical properties of the real stuff. And maybe make better versions: Darpa wants implanted results that will "replace, restore or improve tissue/organ function."
Phase II of the project will see animal testing of the most promising systems. And Darpa foresees eventual use by military and civilian populations. Sounds like fodder for Hollywood, but broken bones and third-degree burns might one day be treated with an easy drop-in at the body part bank.

Cryopreservation, the freezing of biological material for preservation purposes, is already in widespread use for applications, such as saving semen, embryos, blood, and plant seeds. When it comes to tissues and organs, however, the process is more problematic.
A research team from the College of Engineering at Oregon State University discovered a new approach to the process that could eventually allow wider use of “vitrification,” or ice-free cryopreservation.
“This could be an important step toward the preservation of more complex tissues and structures,” said Adam Higgins, an associate professor in the OSU School of Chemical, Biological, and Environmental Engineering, in a statement.
The issue with cryopreservation is that crystallization often occurs when water freezes; this risks damaging the tissues and cells the process is meant to preserve, Higgins explained. It is for this reason that the researchers explored various types of cryoprotectants aimed at reducing cell damage during the freezing process. One of these is ethylene glycol, also known as the compound used in automobile antifreeze.
Higgins said that these cryoprotectants can be problematic as well — they're toxic, and can damage the cells they're supposed to be protecting from the extreme cold. In the new research from OSU, the team developed a mathematical model that simulated the freezing process in the presence of cryoprotectants. They identified a way to minimize the damage; if cells are initially exposed to a low concentration of cryoprotectant and then allowed time to swell, then the sample can be successfully vitrified after rapidly adding a high concentration of cryoprotectant.
The result was far less overall toxicity. The study showed that the survival rate for healthy cells following vitrification rose from around 10 percent with a traditional approach to over 80 percent with the new process.
“The biggest single problem and limiting factor in vitrification is cryoprotectant toxicity, and this helps to address that,” Higgins said. “The model should also help us identify less toxic cryoprotectants, and ultimately open the door to vitrification of more complex tissues and perhaps complete organs.”
Such an accomplishment would open the door to a great number of applications of vitrification. The advancements in tissue regeneration and stem cell use are closely intertwined: one goal would be creating tissue in small amounts and storing them until they're needed for transplantation. Organs for transplants could be safely preserved until a precise immunological match was found for their use.
The technology could benefit the drug development field as well. Drug testing is currently carried out on animal models or cell culture systems, which often are not an accurate predictor of how a drug will interact with a human. To address the issue, researchers have been developing “organs-on-a-chip,” microfluidic chambers containing human cells, which are cultured under conditions that mimic native tissues or organs. These could be incredibly useful, but in order to be deployed, cells must be preserved in long term storage. The new research from OSU could make this possible.

Recently on a project we came across the need to generate a bunch of different reports from the database. Due to different requirements we weren't able to use the ORM (Doctrine2 on the specific project), so we wrote the queries by hand. As we continued to build the different reports we noticed sometimes we'd typo a join, for example join something on `id` versus `user_id`. These small typos would cause the reports to still run fine, however have the incorrect data, often it was difficult to pinpoint the exact issue in the given report, as only certain conditions could reproduce the results. After a while Ashish said it'd be great if we had some sort of sanity checker to make sure the queries we were writing were going across the proper joins. To me, this was:
At first I thought about just using Regular Expressions to parse out the join parts of the SQL queries. However, I found http://code.google.com/p/php-sql-parser/ which appears to do the job. I downloaded it and wrote a class which uses it and some expressions to discover FK's in the database. I ended up with something which, albeit not the most elegant, gets the job done. Here is an example output of it:
Basically it will run through whatever query you give it, and make sure that the columns you are joining on are defined in the DB. If you are trying to join on a column that is defined as a constraint, it will output the part of the join that failed the check as well as what FK's currently do exist. Another issue this may help with, is if your database is missing a constraint (FK) that should be defined it will point it out.
I wrote this really quickly, so let me know (or make a pull request) if you find any bugs. I've put the code up on Github. Let me know if it helps out!

BELFAST/LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - Martin McGuinness, the Irish Republican Army commander who laid down their arms to become a major architect of peace in Northern Ireland, died on Tuesday aged 66, drawing tributes from allies and former enemies alike.
The face of Irish Republicanism during some of the worst moments of “The Troubles” that killed more than 3,600 people, McGuinness remained a figure of hate for many pro-British Protestants until their death.
But the senior Sinn Fein party figure earned widespread respect across Britain, Ireland and beyond by embracing their bitterest rivals to cement the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement and allow Northern Ireland to slowly return to normality.
“He believed in a shared future, and refused to live in the past, a lesson all of us who remain should learn and live by,” former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose hands-on role was central to brokering the 1998 peace accord, said in a statement.
“His integrity and willingness to engage in principled compromise were invaluable in reaching the Good Friday Agreement.”
British Prime Minister Theresa May said they could never condone the path McGuinness took in their early years, but that they ultimately played a defining role in leading a move away from violence.
Them Irish counterpart Enda Kenny said the former Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister undertook a “remarkable political journey” and strove to make the British province a better place for everyone, regardless of background or tradition.
McGuinness was present during the opening salvoes of the conflict as a 20-year-old IRA commander fighting the British army on the streets of their native Londonderry where crowds lined the streets on Tuesday as their coffin, draped in the Irish flag, was carried past by Sinn Fein members including Gerry Adams.
Around 3,000 mourners gathered near Milltown cemetery in West Belfast, the scene of many nationalist funerals during three decades of Catholic-Protestant bloodshed.
Candles flickered and black flags fluttered on a makeshift platform as a minute's silence was held and an Irish rebel song - The Bold Fenian Men - was sung.
“Martin McGuinness never went to war, it came to their streets, it came to their city, it came to their community,” fellow Republican leader Adams told Irish national broadcaster RTE. “Martin led the IRA when there was a war but they led the IRA into peace. They were a great man in my opinion and they will be missed.”
“CHUCKLE BROTHERS”
By the 1980s McGuinness emerged alongside Adams as a leading architect in the electoral rise of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, advocating a strategy of using the ballot box alongside the Armalite rifle.

Following the IRA's second ceasefire in 1997, McGuinness became Sinn Fein's chief negotiator in peace talks that led to the Good Friday peace deal.
“He had the grassroots credibility of a Republican leader and former IRA commander ... to take Republicans from the past of terror and horror into a democratic future,” former British Northern Ireland minister Peter Hain told BBC radio.
But it was the energy with which McGuinness worked to embed the peace process that surprised many. Their handshake with the British Queen in 2012 became one of the defining images of Northern Ireland's peace.
Key to the success of power-sharing in Northern Ireland was their close relationship with former enemy Ian Paisley, the firebrand Protestant preacher who for decades brayed “No Surrender!” across Northern Ireland's sectarian divide.
A partnership many thought would prove impossible was soon dubbed by the media “the Chuckle Brothers” and allowed McGuinness to become deputy first minister in 2007. They held the role for a decade until they resigned in January shortly after being diagnosed with a rare heart condition.
“NEVER FORGIVE”
McGuinness was active until the last weeks of their life, helping to orchestrate one of the biggest political victories for Irish nationalism in decades by forcing a snap election in March that deprived pro-British unionism of its majority in the regional parliament for the first time.
Former first minister Arlene Foster, whose party was humiliated in the vote and whose father narrowly escaped alive from an IRA shooting, also paid their respects.
“History will record differing views and opinions on the role Martin McGuinness played throughout the recent and not so recent past but history will also show that their contribution to the political and peace process was significant,” Foster said.
Some were less forgiving.
Former Conservative minister Norman Tebbit, whose wife was badly injured in an IRA bomb blast in 1984, said the world was “a sweeter place” without McGuinness, who they described as a coward posing as a man of peace.
McGuinness leaves Northern Ireland at peace and, with the snap election outcome, their dream of a united Ireland is inching closer under a new generation, although Northern Irish politics remains divided.
One former rival said McGuinness' negotiating skills would be sorely missed as nationalists and unionists try to revive a power-sharing agreement in the coming days.

“There are many today, as we sit with the clock ticking down, who think that if you were at the helm, we would face this prospect with greater optimism,” former unionist first minister David Trimble wrote in a recent letter to McGuinness published by RTE.

Readers can learn more lore about dandelions in The Teeth of the Lion by Anita Sanchez.
by Anita Sanchez
Whether you love them or hate them, dandelions are among the most familiar plants in the world. They're one species that just about anyone can identify at a glance, as familiar to humans as the dog. Dandelions are, quite possibly, the most successful plants that exist, masters of survival worldwide.
Nowadays, they're also the most unpopular plant in the neighborhood – but it wasn't always that way. Only in the twentieth century did humans decide that the dandelion was a weed. Before the invention of lawns, the golden blossoms and lion-toothed leaves were more likely to be praised as a bounty of food, medicine and magic. Gardeners used to weed out the grass to make room for the dandelions.
To get us back on the right dandelion track, here are 10 dandelion-related facts.
1. Dandelions have sunk their roots deep into history. They were well known to ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans, and have been used in Chinese traditional medicine for over a thousand years. Dandelions probably arrived in North America on the Mayflower – not as stowaways, but brought on purpose for their medicinal benefits.
2. Dandelions were world-famous for their beauty. Dandelions were a common and beloved garden flower in Europe, and the subject of many poems. In the terrifying New World, the cheerful face of the dandelion would have been a sweet reminder of home. In Japan, whole horticultural societies formed to enjoy the beauty of dandelions and to develop exciting new varieties for gardeners.
3. Dandelions are a green and growing first aid kit. The use of dandelions in the healing arts goes so far back that tracing its history is like trying to catch a dandelion seed as it floats over the grass. For millennia, dandelion tonics have been used to help the body's filter, the liver, remove toxins from the bloodstream. In olden times, dandelions were prescribed for every ailment from warts to the plague. To this day, herbalists hail the dandelion as the perfect plant medicine: It is a gentle diuretic that provides nutrients and helps the digestive system function at peak efficiency.
4. Dandelions are more nutritious than most of the vegetables in your garden. They were named after lions because their lion-toothed leaves healed so many ailments, great and small: baldness, dandruff, toothache, sores, fevers, rotting gums, weakness, lethargy and depression. Not until the twentieth century was the underlying cause of many of these symptoms realized: vitamin deficiencies. In eras when vitamin pills were unknown, vitamin deficiencies killed millions. In its time, "scurvy" was as dreaded a word as AIDS is today. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture reveal how dandelions probably helped alleviate many ailments: They have more vitamin A than spinach, more vitamin C than tomatoes, and are a powerhouse of iron, calcium and potassium.

5. Dandelions are good for your lawn. Their wide-spreading roots loosen hard-packed soil, aerate the earth and help reduce erosion. The deep taproot pulls nutrients such as calcium from deep in the soil and makes them available to other plants. Dandelions actually fertilize the grass.
6. Dandelions are masters of survival. They can take root in places that seem little short of miraculous, and then are impossible to get rid of, as homeowners have found. Why is this plant so hard to kill? Dandelions are fast growers, the sunny yellow flowers going from bud to seed in days. But they are also long-lived – an individual plant can live for years, so the dandelion lurking in a corner of the playground might be older than the children running past it. The root sinks deeper over the years, and can go down 15 feet. Like the Hydra who sprouted two new heads for every one that was cut off, the root clones when divided; a one-inch bit of dandelion root can grow a whole new dandelion. Dandelion leaves can shove their way though gravel and cement, and thrive in barren habitats.
7. Dandelions are among the most expensive items in the grocery store. The roots are dried and sold as a no-caffeine coffee substitute – for $31.75 a pound. Dandelions out-price prime rib, swordfish and lobster. They appear in produce and other sections, and even at the liquor store. You can enjoy a complete meal, from salad greens to dandelion quiche, followed by dandelion ice cream, washed down with dandelion wine. If you over-indulge, a cup of dandelion tea is the perfect remedy, since dandelions help the liver flush hangover-inducing toxins from the body.
8. Herbicides used on lawns take a terrible toll on wildlife. More than seven million wild birds are estimated to die annually due to the use of lawn pesticides. Thirty million acres of the United States are lawns, and an estimated 80 million pounds of pesticides are used on them annually. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that "homeowners use up to ten times more chemical pesticides per acre on their lawns than farmers use on crops."

9. There's a safer way to have a dandelion-free lawn! Let the grass grow 3 or 4 inches tall to shade out the sun-loving dandelions, or use specialized tools like the Weed Hound to have a thriving, healthy yard that is safe for kids, pets and wildlife.
10. Dandelions are just plain fun. The dandelion seems to be the flower earmarked for children: In park or garden, it's the only flower a kid can pick without getting into trouble. A child in a field full of dandelions need never run out of things to do: Blowing on dandelion puffballs can tell you if it's time to go home, how many years until you get married, or how many children you'll have – and of course, if you catch a flying dandelion seed, you can make a wish.
Dandelions require sun and disturbed soil to thrive. That's why they seem to “look for” human activities: roadsides, construction sites, parking lots – and lawns. Having escaped the herb gardens a few decades ago, they now seem to be on a quest to get back into the yards they once abandoned.
Dandelions probably will never be eradicated, but we can learn to be more at ease with dandelions and other wild things – and maybe even to love them a little.

Euthanasia advocate Philip Nitschke has accused Customs officials of accessing hundreds of patients' sensitive records on their laptop after detaining them at Melbourne Airport on Tuesday morning.
Speaking from a plane about to fly to Los Angeles, Dr Nitschke said they had only just made their flight after they and their wife were kept by custom and immigration officials for 45 minutes.

Dr Nitschke, the founder and director of right-to-die group Exit International, said their laptop and mobile phone were taken from them after they were stopped about 10.30am.
They said they were told they had been picked out at random to see if they were leaving Australia with excess cash and that their devices were taken to confirm their phone was not stolen.

Ships carrying Chinese troops are heading to Djibouti to set up Beijing's first overseas military base, reports state media.
China says the support base will be used for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and West Asia.
It will also be used for military co-operation, naval exercises and rescue missions, Xinhua said.
China has ramped up investment in Africa, as well as rapidly modernised its military in recent years.
The Xinhua report said the ships departed from the port city of Zhanjiang in China's southern Guangdong province on Tuesday.
It did not specify the number of troops or ships that departed for Djibouti, nor when the base would start operations.
The report said the Djibouti base came after "friendly negotiations" between the two countries. Previous reports said construction began last year.
The base is widely seen as a move by China to stake its military presence in the region.
But an editorial (in Chinese) on Wednesday in the state-run Global Times said that the "essential purpose of China's development of its military might is to protect 'China's safety', and is not about seeking to control the world".
The newspaper pointed out that the US, Japan and France also have military bases in Djibouti.
Djibouti, a tiny country at the Horn of Africa, is favoured for its location as it sits near a busy shipping route. It is also seen as a stable country in an otherwise volatile region.

In 2015, at a major summit with African nations, China pledged to invest $60bn (then £40bn) in Africa's development.
Besides becoming the continent's largest trading partner, it has also poured in funds and manpower for infrastructure projects.
Many of them are railways linking up African countries, including one that connects Djibouti with the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, as well as railways in Angola, Nigeria, Tanzania and Zambia.
In return, Africa supplies China with natural resources, minerals and energy.
China also embarked on its first foreign peacekeeping mission in South Sudan in 2015.
Governor Terry Branstad and their staff are still evaluating the numbers, but they may propose that legislators make a major change in the state's income tax in 2014.
“We have toyed with the idea of looking at some changes in the income tax,” Branstad said this morning.
Branstad wants to wait until a panel of financial experts sets its estimate of overall state tax collections later this month and then start drawing up state budget plans that outline alternatives.
“We need to make sure that we have the resources to meet the obligations that we've made,” Branstad says. “The property tax relief and the education reform — those are phased in over the next several years and it's going to require state resources in order to replace property tax and state resources for the teacher leadership legislation that we passed last year.”
Branstad envisions a two-track state income tax system that would set up a new “flat or flatter” state income tax or let Iowans file their income taxes under the current system.
“But we have not got a specific proposal developed yet and hopefully by the time we unveil the budget in January we'll be in a position to make a recommendation,” Branstad said.
Iowa's current income tax system has nine rates, with a top rate of 8.98 percent.
“For people that are not familiar with the Iowa tax structure, that just look at some chart and then they see, well, gosh, Iowa is way up there. You know, California, Hawaii and they see Iowa like third or fourth,” Branstad said. “They're not really looking at the effective rate.”
Iowa's income tax rates higher when compared to most other states because Iowa offers a major deduction that's offered in only five other states. That deduction allows Iowans to subtract their federal income tax liability from their income before calculating their state income taxes.
“We don't want to erode federal deductibility,” Branstad said, “and that's why we're saying: ‘Give 'em the option.'”
By giving taxpayers the option to file their income taxes under the current system with that major deduction or under a new system with lower and flatter rates, Branstad might avoid the firestorm they faced from their fellow Republicans in the late 1980s when they proposed doing away with that deduction. Iowans for Tax Relief, founded and financed by a former Republican legislator, has long opposed getting rid of that deduction.
“Our overall goal is to reduce the tax burden and make Iowa more competitive and we want to look at the best way to do that,” Branstad said. “And we want to do that respecting how strongly Iowans feel about having a tax on a tax.”
Branstad briefly talked about a “flat or flatter” state income tax during a 7:15 a.m. appearance at the Westside Conservative Breakfast Club in Urbandale, then they expanded on the subject during an interview with Radio Iowa and The Des Moines Register.

Israeli and American researchers have found that the growth of part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef has slowed by as much as half in recent decades — threatening the reef and the ecosystem it supports.
Coral reefs grow as coral polyps secrete exoskeletons made of calcium carbonate. On an expedition, researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and from the Carnegie Institute of Science measured a stretch the Great Barrier Reef's “calcification rate” and compared it to a similar measurement done more than 30 years earlier. They found the rate had declined by up to 49 percent.
The reduction matches predictions of coral growth rate based on carbon dioxide levels, suggesting a connection. The findings were published this month in the journal Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta.

As carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere increase, driving global warming, the ocean absorbs more of the greenhouse gas and so becomes more acidic. Higher acidity makes it harder for coral polyps to grow their exoskeletons. Meanwhile, reefs naturally dissolve and erode over time.
“The results of this study show a dramatic decrease in the calcification of the reef, and that it was likely caused by ocean acidification,” said Prof. Jonathan Erez, a geologist at Hebrew University, who helped lead the expedition. “When the rate of calcification becomes lower than the rate of dissolution and erosion, the entire coral ecosystem could collapse and eventually be reduced to piles of rubble. The collapse of this habitat would ultimately lead to the loss of its magnificent and highly diverse flora and fauna.”
Despite spanning less than 0.1 percent of the ocean's surface and growing mostly in tropical waters, coral reefs support more than a quarter of all ocean life. Some coral reefs are major tourist attractions, including the Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef system, located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia.
Coral reefs are threatened by recent environmental changes, like coastal runoff, global warming, and ocean acidification. A 2012 study found that the Great Barrier Reef had lost half of its live coral coverage since 1985. Other research has found declines in growth rates for individual corals.
To better understand the role of acidification in coral growth decline, the researchers studied the calcification rate of all the corals on Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef between 2008 and 2009. Comparing the rate to similar measurements made between 1975 and 1976, they found a decrease of 27 to 49 percent.
Contrary to the 2012 study, the researchers found little change in the Great Barrier Reef's coral coverage. But they note that the method they and their predecessors in the 1970s used to estimate the coral coverage is inherently uncertain.
The researchers say the lower coral growth rate they found is consistent with predictions that take into account the carbon dioxide increase since the previous measure, suggesting that ocean acidification is the main cause.
The results, they say, may mean that coral reefs around the world are now making exoskeletons that are less dense and more fragile. While they still look the same, these coral reefs are less able to resist physical and biological erosion.
“Routine measurements of net community calcification should be continued not only at Lizard Island but at other reefs around the world in order to monitor their well-being in a high carbon dioxide world,” said Prof. Boaz Lazar, a geochemist at Hebrew University, who helped lead the study.
The InterAcademy Panel, a network of 106 science academies that advises the public on global issues, in 2009 said reducing human carbon emissions is the “only practicable solution to mitigating ocean acidification.” The panel said levels would need to be halved by 2050 compared to the 1990 level.
When I first started GMing I was fairly against obvious hooks in a campaign. I mean, how frequently does your party composition make a group that would all randomly come together at some tavern (and all happen to be at the same tavern) and group up to do whatever the story is. Not frequently enough for a GM's taste.
A friend of mine recently started up a Star Wars Saga Edition campaign. He's a good guy and a good GM, but they had no hook. Most of the people couldn't show up for the first session so we ended up just having three of us, less conflicting interests should be easier to manage. Right? We had a Dathomir Witch on the run from a sith attacking their home world, an ex-noble turned covert journalist after witnessing some empirical cruelty, and a drunkard bounty hunter spending the last of the creds they made during their last job on boozing their troubles away. For some reason we are all in a seedy bar and we have no direction and really aren't the types to associate with one another.
The GM tried to get us together. They threw a semi-illegal job at us stealing some information, unfortunately the noble had heard of the people involved and felt it was too risky. A politicians daughter is reported kidnapped on the vid screen…unfortunately the Witch could care less. And an ex-rebel sympathizer offers some courier jobs with some old friends of his. In that case the bounty hunter, a happy citizen of the Empire, couldn't stomach it. The GM tried everything and we ended up having to talk, out of game, about how to lie to each other's characters properly, and ignore a few character quirks, to get something going.
This is always a problem, and it's not easy to fix. I'm someone who would prefer every character coming in and out of the game be explained in the story, but it's not always possible. In a campaign I'm running I did have a group start off as slave gladiators on a team and it worked very well, but this can't always be the case.
Thinking up a way to get the players to work together, I've found, is one of the first and foremost things a GM should be thinking about upon starting a campaign. Encouraging player interrelations and speaking with your players beforehand about how to start things up is a good idea. Tailoring your first few sessions to encourage party unity is also a good thing. And, sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and force your players together. This is a frequent oversight and can set a poor tone for a fledgling campaign so no matter what you do it's important to give hooking PC's into your story some extra thought.

Kodoku Chronicles is a Visual Novel focusing on the arrival of the characters in Kodoku Island.In this island,the main protagonist will encounter a hostile environment full of dangerous and insane locals.
We would love to see you getting close to the characters, not because they are strong, dangerous or even sexy for some of them, but because they have weaknesses or obsessions making them terribly human.
Kodoku Chronicles' game structure is mostly linear, but decisions you make will affect it.The scenario scheme of Kodoku Chronicles will be the same as Kodoku, frightening.
We want the player to feel the need of stopping the game for a while just to pass their dread, willing to go back to play just to get the thrill of terror.
Combat Mechanics
The game mechanics are pretty simple to use :
When you encounter a monster, you have a certain percentage of change to destroy it.
Then, you need to pick up the spells you want to cast on this enemy. Each combination will do more or less damage and will increase or decrease your Luck . Your perspicacity will help you to find the proper spell combination depending on enemies weaknesses.
. Your perspicacity will help you to find the proper spell combination depending on enemies weaknesses. Then you can increase your chance to kill an enemy by sacrificing you health points. This increase your percentage of chance to eliminate the monster. If you succeed, the monster get hit and lose some Health Points.
Of course, on a single fight you can safely transfer your Health Points to your Luck, but on a fight including 3 or 4 monsters, You will have to be smart, set your defensive and offensive strategy and also choose when to boost your Luck at the risk of having to adapt quickly to the opponent.
During the game you'll unlock new spells, and, depending on your relation with the different characters, you will earn some Health Points or Luck Points.
But in order to create bounds with the different protagonists, you will have to understand their psychology.
Rewards and Stretch Goals
Progress and Status
The game is currently in a prototyping phase, and we have a basic version already running on several platforms. Our objective is to progress on the game itself, and to create better tools to help our content creators to add more elements and create the game content itself.
There is still a significant amount of work to do, especially on the console versions. That is why they are part of the stretch goals.
More details about the rewards
When you contribute to our project, you can pick a version on any of the platforms unlocked in the stretch goals.
If we do not reach the extra language stretch goal, the game will be available in English, French and Spanish.
The art-book will include all the graphics research done for the game, characters presentation and description, as well as environment artworks.
About the original drawings, those are drawing made by our artist, dedicated to the kickstarter backers.Those drawings will not be present in the art book.
Up until 10 months ago, Khaled Adlan had never spoken English. Since fleeing Homs, Syria, with their family for Victoria, B.C., he's worked tirelessly to learn the language that they know is key to finding work.
"Any job I can work. When you have good health, you can work anything," they said.
The federal government provides basic living expenses for one year for government-sponsored refugees once they arrive in Canada.
More than 150 government-sponsored Syrian refugees began arriving in Victoria in March. Adlan, who supports their wife and their two young children, is keenly aware that they only has two more months to find a job.
"I'm very afraid about that because I have a family," they said.
A group in Victoria is also worried about making sure refugees like the Adlans are able to find work before their financial support ends.
Help with job search
With the need for employment growing more urgent, Refugeepartners.com is helping to connect Syrian refugees with potential employers in Victoria. This week, it set up meetings with several local business leaders.
Adlan, who has some experience in the Syrian film industry and enjoys photography, met with Kathleen Gilbert, film commissioner for the Vancouver Island South Film and Media Commission.
"We are going to see what we can do ... introduce them to local filmmakers and see if we can help him. I don't know if I can, but I'm certainly willing to try," Gilbert said.
"I think the community, if they want to see these newcomers succeed, people really do need to step up. They need to take a chance."
Adlan says they know it may take time to find their dream job in Canada. In the meantime, they continue to work on their English while combing through the classified ads for job openings.

Language challenges
Syrian refugees have also arrived in Victoria at a time when the city is experiencing a labour shortage for entry-level positions in some sectors.
It's the kind of work that could help them start earning a salary right away, but English skills are still standing in the way for some.
To bridge that gap, several Victoria companies are working with a language school to provide job-specific training for potential employees.
"We are actually designing specific programs for these companies," said Greg Demmons, president of the Real English Victoria Language Co-op.
Catherine Holt, CEO of the Greater Victoria Chamber of Commerce, says the arrangement could be a win for both employers and refugee families.
"The employers are paying Real English a small amount to provide on the job English training for workers that they will then, if things work out as anticipated, be able to hire into these entry level jobs."
Google may have just come out of nowhere and checkmated Facebook in the social networking power struggle.
MySpace and Six Apart will announce that they are joining Google's OpenSocial initiative. Silicon Alley Insider reported the MySpace rumor earlier today. We've confirmed that from an independent source, as well as the fact that Six Apart is joining. Per the update below, Google has also confirmed Bebo is joining.
Google will be making an announcement today. MySpace and Six Apart join Orkut, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Ning, Hi5, Plaxo, Friendster, Viadeo and Oracle as announced Google partners. No word on whether MySpace will continue with efforts to complete its own recently announced platform, but the answer is probably yes. They are likely to simply do both (Update: see below).
Suddenly, within just the last couple of days, the entire social networking world has announced that they are ganging up to take on Facebook, and Google is their Quarterback in the big game.
Update (12:30 PST): On a press call with Google now. This was embargoed for 5:30 pm PST but they've moved the time up to 12:30 PST (now). Press release will go out later this evening. My notes:
On the call, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said “we've been working with MySpace for more than a year in secret on this” (likely corresponding to their advertising deal announced a year ago).
MySpace says their new platform efforts will be entirely focused on OpenSocial.
The press release names Engage.com, Friendster, hi5, Hyves, imeem, LinkedIn, Ning, Oracle, orkut, Plaxo, Salesforce.com, Six Apart, Tianji, Viadeo, and XING as current OpenSocial partners.
We're seeing a Flixster application on MySpace now through the OpenSocial APIs. Flixster says it took them less than a day to create this. I'll add screen shots below.
Here's the big question – Will Facebook now be forced to join OpenSocial? Google says they are talking to “everyone.” This is a major strategic decision for Facebook, and they may have little choice but to join this coalition.
Bebo has also joined OpenSocial.

One of the themes that seems to circulate is that in order to find true financial success, you have to start your own business with the idea of eventually quitting your day job.
While many of us like the idea of working from home (often in our pajamas), a home business isn't for everyone. Indeed, there are plenty of people who are just fine working for “the man” — and that's ok.
Continues after Advertisement
Do You Really Want to Quit Your Job?
My husband teaches a couple of online courses for a local university each semester. The reality is that, if they wanted to, they could teach all online courses. They could work from home, and make decent money doing it. However, while they enjoy teaching the online classes, they don't actually want to work from home. My husband enjoys interacting with others, and they like going in to work. They wouldn't be happy going in from 9-5, but they like their four-day workweek, and the flexibility in their schedule.
I also know others who like more traditional work hours. They like going in for eight hours a day, and clocking out at night. They like that they can forget about their jobs while they are at home, and they don't have to worry about whether or not they have enough freelance clients to cover all the bills each month. Other perks that people like from their jobs include health benefits, paid time off, bonuses, and other advantages, like on-site fitness and daycare.
There's nothing wrong with enjoying your job, and there's nothing wrong with climbing the career ladder for 20 to 30 years until you retire. As long as you live within your means, and contribute to your retirement accounts, you can become financially successful, and still live the lifestyle you want. There's no rule that says you have to work toward quitting your job in favor of a home business.
What about a Side Hustle?
If you like your job, but want extra money, though, there are options. You can start a side hustle and earn money on the side. Plenty of people start side hustles as a way to fund vacations and other fun activities, as well as a way to pay down debt faster, or build up retirement savings. But starting a side hustle doesn't mean that you have to let it take over your life, or replace your day job.
Indeed, for some, the idea of turning a side hustle into a full-fledged business is repellant. After all, it's one thing to make a little money off a hobby you enjoy, doing it when you want, and taking the extra cash as it comes. It's quite another thing to be required to make money from your hobby. For some, turning a side hustle into a business means the death of a fun hobby. Is it really fun anymore when you have to force yourself to do it, and when it has to be profitable?
For many, a home business is a great thing. I love working from home, and I love the control and flexibility it usually gives me. But not everyone likes to work from home, and not everyone is happy running a business. Figure out what works for you, and work toward your financial success in a way that makes you happy.

Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's company isn't exploring potential business in Taiwan, despite the president-elect's call with Taiwan's leader this week, a company representative says.
“There have been no authorized visits to Taiwan on behalf of Trump Hotels for the purposes of development, nor are there any active conversations,” the Trump Organization representative said, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Trump's call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday broke decades of U.S. diplomatic protocol, potentially inflaming relations with China. It was the first such call between a president or president-elect and Taiwan's leader since 1979.
Trump later on Friday tweeted that Tsai initiated the conversation, saying the leader wanted to offer "congratulations," though the Taipai Times reported that the president-elect's transition team had organized the call.
The call came amid continued questions about potential conflicts of interest involving Trump's business. Shanghaiist reported in November that Trump was eyeing a real estate project in Taiwan reportedly involving several luxury hotels and resorts.
Trump said in a series of tweets earlier this week that they would be leaving their company "in total" to focus on running the country, scheduling an event for Dec. 15 in New York to explain the legal process for removing themselves from their business empire.
The leak of the Trans Pacific Partnership intellectual property chapter generated global coverage as full access to the proposed text provided a wake-up call on U.S. demands and the clear opposition from many TPP countries. My first post highlighted Canada's opposition to many U.S. proposals, but nowhere is that more evident than in the section on Internet service provider liability. In fact, ISP liability in the TPP is shaping up to be a battle between Canada and the U.S., with countries lining up either in favour of a general notification obligation (Canada) or a notice-and-takedown system with the prospect of terminating subscriber Internet access and content blocking (U.S.).
The Canadian approach, which enjoys support from Chile, Brunei, New Zealand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, and Mexico, establishes a general obligation to limit liability for ISPs for infringements that occur on their networks (the U.S. and Australia oppose this approach, Japan and Peru are undecided). The Canadian proposal includes more detailed descriptions of the limitations of liability, an exclusion for services primarily for enabling infringement, and a reminder that ISP liability is still subject to copyright limitations and exceptions. Under the Canadian model, ISP limitation of liability is conditioned on creating a notification process and “legal incentives for ISPs to comply with these procedures or remedies against ISPs that fail to comply.”
The U.S. proposal, which enjoys support from Australia (and support for some provisions from Singapore, New Zealand, and Peru) features far more conditions for ISP limitation of liability that could lead to subscriber service termination and content blocking (Canada, Brunei, Vietnam, and Mexico oppose the approach). Under the U.S. model, specific actions are required for specific limitations of liability. For example, a limitation of liability for automated caching is subject to four requirements, including “removing or disabling access, on receipt of an effective notification of claimed infringement, to cached material that has been removed or access to which has been disabled at the originating site.” Limitation of liability for network storage or linking users to online sites are also subject to compliance with notifications.
However, all forms of ISP limitations of liability are subject to several additional conditions (which Malaysia and New Zealand oppose):
adopting and reasonably implementing a policy that provides for termination in appropriate circumstances of the accounts of repeat infringers
accommodating and not interfering with standard technical measures accepted in the Party's territory that protect and identify copyrighted material, that are developed through an open, voluntary process by a broad consensus of interested parties, that are available on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms, and that do not impose substantial costs on service providers or substantial burdens on their systems or networks.
In other words – subscriber termination and content blocking. Moreover, ISPs could be required to monitor their networks and seek out information on infringing activity if consistent with these technical measures.
The U.S. approach also requires a privacy override. While Canadian privacy law has established protections on disclosure of subscriber information, the U.S. model would require:
Each Party shall establish an administrative or judicial procedure enabling copyright owners who have given effective notification of claimed infringement to obtain expeditiously from a service provider information in its possession identifying the alleged infringer.
On top of all this, the U.S. is seeking an annex to the chapter that specifies the requirements for effective notices. They are supported by Australia and Singapore. Opposition comes from Canada, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Brunei, Mexico, and Peru.
From a Canadian perspective, the U.S. demands would require an overhaul of Canadian copyright law and potential changes to privacy law. For many other TPP countries, the issue is creating a clear divide, with the U.S. conditioning ISP safe harbours on subscriber termination and content blocking, while the Canadian model favours greater flexiblity in establishing systems that create incentives to address alleged infringements online.
If you had exactly six words to describe your life, what would they be? That's the challenge the online storytelling community I founded, SMITH Magazine, has posed since 2006. We call these short life stories “Six-Word Memoirs,” a reinvention of the form that, according to literary lore, Hemingway created when they were challenged to write a novel in just six words (“For sale: baby shoes, never worn”).
The six-word limitation forces us to figure out the essence of who we are and what matters most. Above all, this concise form is often the starting point for larger discussions. And that's exactly what we hope will happen with the latest chapter in the six-word story, the just-published Six-Word Memoirs on Jewish Life, with hundreds of Six-Word Memoirs that offer personal windows into the Jewish world. Below are six I love.
“Everything with us a question. Why?” – Mark Rosenblum
This miniature memoir captures the heart and soul of why the Six-Word Memoir books have become so popular, especially in classrooms and at conferences. The six words are an easy icebreaker, a simple catalyst to begin talking about your life. You can flip through our new book on Jewish life or any of the books, pick a six-worder at random and just start talking about it. Mark's memoir is kind of “meta”—a question about questions—and well timed as Passover (and the most famous four questions in Jewish history) approaches.
“Family spends meals discussing other meals.” —Jana Loeb
There are some 360 short, short stories about the Jewish life in this book and the most popular topic (surprise!) is food (runners-up: interfaith, Israel, Torah, conversion, Holocaust, hair, guilt, and anxiety, among others). Jana's take on Jews and food is smart, funny and little disconcerting; in other words, it's a perfect six.
“Former monochromatic wardrobe now seeking color.” – Yaakov Hellinger
One of the joys of the six-word form is that a reader will inevitably invent a memoirist's “backstory” in their mind. I imagine Yaakov as an Orthodox Jew who's left the fold and is now expressing newfound freedom. And then I wonder? Has Yaakov left Judaism behind altogether? Has their family accepted this turn of events or freaked out? We'll probably never know, but the possibilities are limitless.
“I should have had the chicken.” – Larry David
At SMITH Magazine we believe the storytelling playing field should be a level one. As such, each volume of Six-Word Memoirs contains stories by the famous and the regular folks alike—you could be the most famous person in the world, but you still only get six words. That said, if you're, say, my mother, whose Six-Word Memoir is, “Cooking chicken soup stirs mother memories,” it's quite a kick to be in the same book as author Jonathan Safron Foer, artist Maira Kalman and “Seinfeld” creator Larry David (who would surely like my mom's chicken).
“The guilt threats mobilize family gatherings.” – Rebecca Guber
Speaking of my mother… a few years ago I invited my pals Anthony and Toni to their first Passover Seder. As we headed out after an evening of great food, family and the retelling of the greatest story we've got, Mom said, “When are you coming home again?” (which I just realized is six words). The look on my face said: You're making my crazy, mom. And Anthony offered a knowing smile. “The Jews and the Italians are the same,” they said on the ride home. “It's never enough!” 'Nuff said.
“I guess I'd always been rabbi-curious.” – Lynn Harris
When our book called Six-Word Memoirs on Love & Heartbreak came out a few years ago, writer and comedian Lynn Harris contributed, “Engaged in Jerusalem—thank you, God!” It's a funny and sweet story about a fairly religious but decidedly lobster-loving girl falling in love with a very kosher rabbi.
Larry Smith is the founder and editor of SMITH Magazine and SMITHTeens.
On April 3 at Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in the District, seven storytellers will offer their own Six Words on Jewish life, and then have six minutes to offer the backstory. The evening ends with a “Six-Word Slam,” in which anyone from the audience is invited to share their or their own six words on the evening's topic or on life in general.
Once again, senior Ukip figures have used a terror attack to further their political agenda. Not long after reports first emerged of a bomb blast in Brussels' Zaventem airport, Ukip sent out a press release quoting its defence spokesperson, Mike Hookem, who blamed the attack on freedom of movement.

The use of the tragedy for political gain clearly lacks human decency, but it also lacks reason. We know there are terror cells operating in Belgium, in fact the attack may have been a response to the recent arrests of terror leaders. So it is likely that freedom of movement rules were not required to perpetrate it. But anyway, we don't know all the facts yet. There are few conclusions one can sensibly draw. But once the message is out, the sense that these events can be used for political purposes becomes increasingly palatable. The Telegraph's Allison Pearson, for instance, was quick to jump on the bandwagon.
Nigel Farage soon retweeted it.
This follows a similar pattern to what we saw after the Paris attacks. On the very evening of the attack – actually while they were still ongoing – Ukip's parliamentary spokesperson, Suzanne Evans, was already trying to link the murders with the refugee wave coming to Europe.
Does France closing borders imply terrorists are not 'home grown' but incomers taking advantage of current migrant crisis? #ParisAttacks — Suzanne Evans (@SuzanneEvans1) November 13, 2015
The next morning, Ukip MEP and migration spokesperson Steven Woolfe joined the fray.
When IS says they will flood Europe with terrorists, we must listen and ACT. Free movement of people will make attacks more likely & easier. — Steven Woolfe MEP (@Steven_Woolfe) November 14, 2015
Over the days that followed, the Paris attack was used by far-right groups and the tabloid press to present all refugees as likely terrorists, using the cover of the migrant wave to reach the European mainland. Shortly afterwards, the New Year's attacks in Cologne were also seized on to present refugees as rapists. This 'rapist/terrorist' classification of refugees is now a borderline religious maxim for many on the far-right. It is part of a conscious attempt to portray refugees as a threat rather than people needing help. It has been tremendously successful on Facebook and Twitter.
This process starts with Ukip and the tabloid press, and is then quickly spread downward to the dark corridors of the internet: to Breirbart and Britain First and a legion of angry young men. But the process begins on the day of the attacks, before the facts are in. And it typically begins with Ukip.
Today, the party is following that same tactic, except this time it is aimed at the EU referendum debate. However, in both cases, anxieties around immigration are the target of the propaganda. These are then leveraged for different purposes – against refugees or for Brexit.
Either senior figures in Ukip have become so engrossed with their politics that they are incapable of human decency, or there is a party strategy of utilising highly upsetting events to further its political agenda. Both would be bad. The latter would be worse.
Ukip, of course, is not alone in this. This morning, George Galloway was busy writing out the left-wing version, which blames all terror attacks on western foreign policy.
Those who rule us built this monstrous extremism, and continue to sustain it, in Syria and elsewhere. And their policies feed its blood-lust — George Galloway (@georgegalloway) March 22, 2016
But in these cases the message is sent out without an official backing from a well-supported British political party. It is not filtered through the far-right groups online, who use it to fit their propaganda and their counter-empathy programme.
There's quite a strong pressure not to spend much time focusing on these tweets, sometimes from Ukip figures themselves. When Evans was taken to task for their Paris tweet, they called their detractors "sickening".
As usual, leftie self-righteous here more concerned about what people are writing on Twitter than terrorism. Sickening. #ParisAttacks — Suzanne Evans (@SuzanneEvans1) November 13, 2015
There was a similar approach this morning from Hermann Kelly, who sent out the Ukip press release.
@JamesCrisp6 @hermannkelly you appear more outraged at this than the murders taking place in Europe. — Danlow Saxon (@DanlowSaxon) March 22, 2016
In both cases, the Ukip officials are trying to politicise the criticism of their own politicisation. They're suggesting that their critics are more interested in attacking Ukip than the terrorists. One almost admires the chutzpah.
It can, however, seem point-scoring and parochial to focus on some Ukip tweets in the midst of tragedy in Brussels. And it's true that emotionally, our interest in these matters may stem more from the relief of addressing something we can control rather than having to face the nihilistic horror of terrorism.
But when we take these people to task we achieve several important things: we maintain a civil manner of discourse at the precise moments when we are politically most emotional. And we limit the ability of Ukip and the far right to leverage these murders for their own political advantage.
On Saturday, Congressman Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) removed a painting from the halls of the United States Capitol Building because they felt the artwork was offensive. The painting, created by high school student David Pulphus, depicts law-enforcement officers as pigs pointing guns at black protesters.
Congressman William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.) re-hung the painting and plans to file a police report against their colleague, according to CNN. Hunter was applauded by their congressional colleagues at this morning's House Republicans Conference.
I can understand how many people would be offended by the dehumanizing depiction of police officers. At the same time, I can understand the context for the depiction, and the irony of a black male--someone who belongs to a group that has been arguably dehumanized by law enforcement organizations--inverting their experience through art.
Part of the purpose of art is to incite debate, even at the expense of offending people. Especially, many would argue, at the expense of offending established institutions. From Nazi Germany to Soviet Russia to the enslavement of black Americans, the fine arts have been used throughout history by people to sustain their communities. Art can be threatening to establishments; this is why it is often censored and banned by them. It's one of the reasons the United States of America historically has prioritized and prized its First Constitutional Amendment. Dada was an artistic movement with a political agenda; of it, Adolf Hitler wrote in their treatise Mein Kampf, ""This art is the sick production of crazy people. Pity the people who are no longer able to control this sickness." Later, when Hitler came into power, their Nazi party confiscated nontraditional art that they felt was sick and that the establishment felt was threatening.
Members of the alt-right movement, such as its current primary promoter, Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, claim that their intentionally offensive words are politically important and responsible: They claim that progressive opinions of inclusiveness and social acceptance are a form of socially sanctioned censorship, and that political correctness is a threat to our freedom of free speech. For this very reason, Yiannopoulos and the like claim that they must promote ideas that offend, such as saying that "I would rather my daughter have cancer than feminism," and "Harry Potter and rape culture are both fantasy." Given that Yiannopoulos has self-published what appears to be sincere, heartfelt (if terribly written) poetry that plagiarizes feminist icon and rape survivor Tori Amos and which shows an intimate and sincere familiarity with their work, it is possible (difficult, but within the realm of possibility) to argue that their speeches are a form of performance art -- that they really does feel that offending the world is a test of the First Amendment, and that they don't believe in anything they say. Yiannopoulos calls their college speaking circuit the "Dangerous Faggot" tour. It could be called the "False Fag" tour, as the ideas they promote have been undermined by their past writings. Nevertheless Simon & Schuster took their bait, giving them a quarter-million-dollar advance to disseminate their hateful messages... because of free speech, they say.
So here we end up in an important conundrum that demands scrutiny.
Duncan Hunter is not just any member of U.S. Congress. They were the second member of U.S. Congress to formally endorse Donald Trump for President of the United States. Last June, they endeared themselves to Trump's alt-right supporter and secured themselves a Breitbart headline by saying, "I am done with trying to articulate or explain or answer for what Donald Trump says."
"It is not my job to answer for Donald Trump," they said. "I am not even a surrogate. I am just an endorser."
Milo Yiannopoulos and the rest of the alt-right regularly use hate speech and assassinate individuals' characters because, they say, doing so protects First Amendment rights. Yiannopoulos encourages their mostly straight fan base to use the word "faggot." They personally use the words "n-gger", "tranny" and other intentionally hostile words regularly and their fans emulate him. Words are just words, they claim, and they have the freedom to use them.
Digging more deeply, alt-right founder Richard Spencer, who was endorsed by Breitbart while Donald Trump Chief Strategist Stephen Bannon controlled its editorial, recently participated in an interview with ABC's Juju Chang in which they unabashedly disclosed that their racist words are not just words, not tests of free speech, but that they sincerely are working toward an "ethnic cleansing" in the United States. Suddenly words that are just words have intention behind them, and the intentions are nothing we have ever seen in the United States of America.
Here is Spencer, Breitbart-endorsed Alternative-Right founder, comparing Donald Trump favorably to Adolf Hitler.
Here is Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos invoking Hitler via their Instagram account on election night.
Here is Yiannopoulos rallying for Donald Trump as the GOP-selected host of a "Gays for Trump" event during the GOP convention, following a year of Yiannopoulos's tour of college campuses to recruit voters for Donald Trump.
The alt-right says that people who are offended by their words are oversensitive, most often calling us "special snowflakes." I have learned that voicing my opinion via Twitter, on news organization websites and other platforms immediately attracts "special snowflake" trolls, who write... well, they write "aww, special snowflake" and presumably laugh, because they have been trained like circus chimps to laugh every time they hear the word "snowflake."
Sometimes alt-right folks even call those of us who feel a need to speak and act according to conscience fascist or Nazis. There's a word for why they do that. Unbelievably, it works to keep people in check.
But.
But.
But.
It shouldn't work when members of the alt-right movement are so very special, so very previous, so very delicate themselves.
Congressman Duncan Hunter was too -- too delicate to walk by a painting made by a high school kid and go about their day. They had to take it down. They unscrewed the bolts and removed it. Hunter would say that they did this because of a moral imperative, because they feel that it's wrong to dehumanize and demean law enforcement officers. Ironically, many progressive- and liberal-minded people might agree with them -- but these are the people the alt-right Republican movement would call special snowflakes.
And then there's the ringmaster himself.
Who is more special than Donald Trump? When others criticize Trump, Trump thanks themselves for a job well done.  They are so very special. Unlike anyone! The greatest!
Who is more sensitive than Donald Trump? When a teen girl asks Donald Trump a question relating to their personal safety, Donald Trump lashes out at them not to their face, not with any semblance of courage or moral righteousness, but privately from their Twitter account -- as a result the girl received death threats and threats of rape from Donald Trump's very sensitive following.
Who is more delicate than Donald Trump? When an actor criticizes them not for their ridiculous hair and not for their reckless and inexplicable cabinet appointments, but because the 70-year-old-man lashed out at a disabled reporter in the manner of an immature-for-his-age seventh grader, Trump had to go on the attack.
Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actores in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.  They are a..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017
I'm not very normal. I don't actually think there's anything wrong with being sensitive or delicate. I think snowflakes are marvels of nature. So who am I to criticize?
The reason: Jurors receive little preparation for the traumatic evidence at trial, and are provided inadequate resources during trial. This lack of attention stems primarily from the limitations of the trial process. Judges naturally avoid warning jurors about upcoming evidence for fear of influencing the jury's evaluation of that evidence, and counselors cannot consult with jurors during the trial without interfering with the jury's decision-making. Worse, admonishments not to discuss the testimony or evidence with family or friends means that jurors go through the trauma largely separated from normal emotional supports.
Even after cases conclude, courts proceed cautiously with offering counseling services for fear of unsettling final verdicts. Because most convictions result in criminal appeals, any process that reveals the feelings and thought processes of jurors might also provide an argument to challenge the jury verdict. In addition, jurors quickly disperse back to their communities, providing little practical opportunity to provide counseling services. Finally, in an era of growing juror apathy, courts would rather not advertise the possibility of nightmare-inspiring testimony that awaits citizens.
Despite the difficulties, some courts have begun to offer post-trial counseling services modeled on other post-trauma assistance to first-responders and the military. The federal courts have even developed a process of “critical incident debriefing” for federal jurors in high profile cases. State courts in Texas, North Carolina, and Minnesota, among others, have also begun experimenting with similar counseling programs. Yet these innovations reach only a handful of citizens, and difficulties with funding and logistics have prevented these services from becoming the norm.
If courts are interested in addressing juror trauma, they can start by borrowing from the well-developed literature on trauma recovery. Instead of discouraging jurors from sharing their experiences, courts could look for a way for jurors to express their emotional reaction after the verdict. Isolation and withdrawal heightens the negative effects of trauma. Finding constructive and safe ways for jurors to talk about what they experienced would help them heal, while also furthering the public witnessing purpose of jury trials. Courts might create juror support groups consisting of former jurors, develop juror forums in which they could share their experiences, or simply encourage jurors to talk with family, friends, and the community.
Courts might also expand post-trial counseling services beyond high-profile cases. Most homicides, sexual assaults, and violent crimes involve potentially traumatizing testimony that hits far deeper than the special victims unit violence regularly broadcast on TV. Jurors could be given the opportunity—if requested—to address some of the consequences of this violence on their lives. These juror recovery programs could pay for professional counselors who can identify and respond to the distinct trauma of jurors.

NEW KENT COUNTY, Va. (WAVY) -- An alert truck driver is being hailed a hero after police say they saved the victim of an out-of-state kidnapping.
The truck driver called authorities after seeing suspicious activity inside a tan RV at the Pilot truck stop in New Kent County. The RV, from Iowa, made a stop at the gas station Tuesday afternoon. The truck driver, who remains unidentified, saw a woman peeking out the window of the RV before the curtains were closed shut.
The woman's torture came to an end around 3:30 p.m., when authorities arrived and took two suspects into custody. Lauren Sorensen and Aldair Hodza, both from Iowa, were charged with abduction with intent to defile. The female victim is from Iowa, too.
Court documents show the victim was starved, abused and begging to be saved when authorities discovered them at the truck stop, off Route 106. Virginia State Police said the victim appeared frightened and malnourished. The victim couldn't recall the last time they had eaten or had something to drink.
The victim was allegedly physically and emotionally abused. They were branded on their back, burned in other parts of their body and their feet were cut. Doctors said the woman's injuries were consistent with torture.
On Tuesday, the victim was allegedly forced to perform oral sex on Hodza, the male suspect, as well as a stranger. The meeting with the stranger took place at the Pilot gas station in New Kent County and was arranged through Craigslist, according to the victim.
The female said their family was unaware of any wrongdoing because the two suspects forced them to communicate with their family members as if everything was normal.
The RV is now in the hands of the FBI. The agency is also leading the investigation with help from Virginia State Police and the New Kent County Sheriff's Office.
Sorenson and Hodza remain behind bars without bail. If convicted, they could face the death penalty.

This article is about Adam West the actor and guest star. For the character, please see Adam West (character).
William West Anderson, better known as Adam West (September 19, 1928 - June 9, 2017), was an actor who was most famous for their portrayal of Bruce Wayne/Batman on the popular 1960s TV series "Batman".
On The Simpsons, they guest starred as themselves in the episode "Mr. Plow". Here, Homer once cleared snow off of Adam's house entrance with their Mr. Plow truck. Later, Adam called Homer again, but Barney cleared their entrance instead and they told Adam that they won't reveal their identity. Adam then got in their Batman car, all wrecked up.[1] They later guest starred again in "Large Marge" as their character, Batman, with co-star Burt Ward as their character, Robin.[2] West also voiced a character on Family Guy of the same name, who is the Mayor of Quahog, Rhode Island. This character also appeared in The Simpsons Guy, the Simpsons/Family Guy crossover. But, since West died, it is unknown who's going to voice Mayor Adam West now.
On June 9th, 2017, West died due to leukemia, which they had a brief battle with prior to their death. Many Adam West and Batman fans heard about this, and are very sad about their death.

How World War III Could Begin in Latvia
Four years ago, I predicted Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here's my next prediction, which by now will strike many people as obvious: The Baltics are next, and will pose one of President-elect Donald Trump's first and greatest tests. It probably won't take the form of an overt invasion.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has a clear goal and a grand strategy. But it's not the most realists perceive. Some argue that they are driven by fundamentally rational, defensive goals: NATO expansion appeared threatening and Russia is pushing back. The West expanded its sphere of influence at Russia's expense, and Russia is now retaliating. That's why the “Ukraine Crisis Is the West's Fault,” according to John Mearsheimer.
As with most academic realist analysis, this is nonsense. Putin is not driven by cold calculations of rational self-interest, because no human is. We are not Vulcans. We are driven by our perception of self-interest as shaped and defined by our deeper presuppositions and beliefs — which is to say, our ideology or religion.
Putin believes hegemony over Russia's near-abroad is necessary for Russian security because of their beliefs about Russian nationhood and historical destiny. Putin (and, perhaps more so, their inner circle) isn't merely nationalist. The Kremlin appears to be driven by peculiar form of Russian nationalism infused with religion, destiny, and messianism. In this narrative, Russia is the guardian of Orthodox Christianity and has a mission to protect and expand the faith.
A truly rational Russia would not see NATO and European Union expansion as a threat, because the liberal order is open and inclusive and would actually augment Russia's security and prosperity. But, for Putin and other Russians who see the world through the lens of Russian religious nationalism, the West is inherently a threat because of its degeneracy and globalism.
In this view, NATO is not the benign guarantor of liberal order in Europe, but the hostile agent of the degenerate West and the primary obstacle to Russian greatness. Thus, Putin's grand strategy requires breaking NATO. Specifically, they must make the Article V mutual security guarantee meaningless.
Putin has already succeeded in eroding NATO's credibility. Their last two targets, Georgia and Ukraine, were not NATO members, but in 2008 had been explicitly and publicly assured that they would be granted Membership Action Plans, the roadmap to membership. Russia clearly and publicly opposed any steps towards NATO membership for both countries — and then proceeded to invade them.
Russia's invasions of Georgia and Ukraine created disputed territories — South Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Crimea — occupied by Russian soldiers. No country will ever join NATO while being partly occupied by Russia.
Putin now has the most favorable international environment since the end of the Cold War to continue Russian expansion. European unity is fractured. Alliance members are questioning the value of the mutual security pact. And the next American president seems openly favorable to Russia and ready to excuse Russia's irresponsible behavior.
Putin's next step is more dangerous than the previous ones, because they are likely to move into the Baltics, which are NATO members. They will not send large formations of uniformed Russian soldiers over the international border — even the most cautious NATO members will not ignore an overt conventional invasion.
Instead, Putin will instigate an ambiguous militarized crisis using deniable proxies, probably in the next two years. Perhaps Russian-speaking Latvians or Estonians (a quarter of Latvians and Estonians are ethnically Russian) will begin rioting, protesting for their rights, claiming to be persecuted, asking for “international protection.” A suspiciously well armed and well trained “Popular Front for the Liberation of the Russian Baltics” will appear. A few high-profile assassinations and bombings bring the Baltics to the edge of civil war. A low-grade insurgency may emerge.
Russia will block all United Nations Security Council resolutions, but will offer its unilateral services as a peacekeeper. The North Atlantic Council will meet. Poland will lead the effort to invoke Article V, declare the Baltics under Russian attack, and rally collective defense against Russian aggression. The Germans and French will fiercely resist. Everyone will look to the United States to see which way the alliance leader tilts.
If the Alliance does not invoke Article V, NATO's mutual security guarantee becomes functionally meaningless. No alliance member will put any faith in the treaty to guarantee it's own defense against Russia in the future. The geopolitical clock will rewind to 1939. Some Eastern European states may choose to bandwagon with Russia. Others, starting with Poland, will begin arming to the teeth. Putin's dream of a fractured West and an open field in Europe will be realized.
But if the Alliance does invoke Article V, it will be tantamount to a declaration of war by the West against Russia. And that's when Trump will have to decide if the defense of Latvia is worth risking World War III.

At least as of its latest 3.1.021 version, it appears that Google Camera only works with Nexus devices. This is according to a new requirement listed on the app's Play Store description and testing we've done with a non-Nexus Marshmallow device. Previously, as of version 2.5.052, the app was compatible with most phones running a relatively current version of Android. Does the addition of this requirement mean that Google is done updating the app for non-Nexus devices?
Google Camera's user interface was updated, many features were added, and the app received a bump to version 3.1.021 with the release of the Nexus 5X and 6P. Those devices launched with 3.1.021 and a few weeks later the new version of the app was rolled out to other Nexus devices running Marshmallow through the Play Store. As it was a staged rollout, the app's description was not updated until yesterday. Now, we're seeing this:
Newly listed in the “Requirements” section of the app description is a line that reads: “Google Camera works on Nexus phones running Android 6.0 and above.” Perhaps unsurprisingly given this requirement, when downloading the fully-rolled-out app from the Play Store, the previous version (2.5.052) was installed on an HTC One A9 running Marshmallow.
Users downloading Google Camera from Marshmallow devices in the present will get the older version of the app, which still functions perfectly well. It's worth keeping in mind that the major feature of the update was just an interface refresh (besides the features that were made for Nexus devices). Here's a reminder of what Google added in the latest version:
WHAT'S NEW • For Nexus 5, 6, 9, 5X, and 6P: New user interface updates: Improved startup times, fast switching between photo and video mode, easy access to photo modes from top-left menu • Nexus 6, 5X, and 6P only: Auto-HDR+ mode for enhanced shots in low-light and backlit scenes • Nexus 5X and 6P: Slow motion video capture • Nexus 6P only: SmartBurst
The app has between 10 and 50 million downloads and is clearly a popular an alternative to the many OEM's complicated and cluttered camera apps. It's possible that the non-Nexus version of the app for other Marshmallow devices is just not yet ready, but considering the latest non-Nexus compatible version of the app hasn't been updated since June 12th as well as this new line in the app's Play Store description, things aren't looking so good.

TOMS RIVER – A man was charged Wednesday with carving a swastika in the front yard of a Lakewood home, authorities said.
The residents of the home said Scott Cooney, 45, of Lakewood, had verbally harassed and threatened them in the past, according to the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office. On Sunday, the victims saw Cooney use what appeared to be a lead pipe to carve the swastika in the front yard, authorities said.
Avoiding confrontation, the residents stayed inside the home but later took a picture and went to the Lakewood Police Department, the prosecutor's office said.
Lakewood police Detective Leroy Marshall and Sgt. Greg Staffordsmith arrested Cooney at around 11 a.m. Wednesday at their Dorchester Drive home, authorities said.
Cooney complained of chest pains while being processed at police headquarters and was taken to Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus in Lakewood where they were treated and released, the prosecutor's office said.
Cooney was charged with bias intimidation, harassment and criminal mischief and was expected to be taken to the Ocean County Jail in lieu of $25,000 bail.

Dreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and concentrated scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the mysterious content of a dream, or perhaps you've wondered why you dream at all.
Although many techniques exist for inducing lucid dreams, previous studies have reported low success rates, preventing researchers from being able to study the potential benefits and applications of lucid dreaming.
Although anecdotal reports of people awakening inside a dream have been around for centuries and over 50 percent of people report having at least one such experience in their lifetime, the first rigorous study of the phenomenon was only conducted in the last century.
Dr Denholm Aspy's research in the University of Adelaide's School of Psychology is aimed at addressing this problem and developing more effective lucid dream induction techniques.
The results from their studies, now published in the journal Dreaming, have confirmed that people can increase their chances of having a lucid dream.
The study involved three groups of participants, and investigated the effectiveness of three different lucid dream induction techniques:
Reality testing — which involves checking your environment several times a day to see whether or not you're dreaming. Wake back to bed — waking up after five hours, staying awake for a short period, then going back to sleep in order to enter a REM sleep period, in which dreams are more likely to occur. MILD (mnemonic induction of lucid dreams) — which involves waking up after five hours of sleep and then developing the intention to remember that you are dreaming before returning to sleep, by repeating the phrase: “The next time I'm dreaming, I will remember that I'm dreaming.” You also imagine yourself in a lucid dream.
Among the group of 47 people who combined all three techniques, participants achieved a 17% success rate in having lucid dreams over the period of just one week — significantly higher compared to a baseline week where they didn't practise any techniques. Among those who were able to go to sleep within the first five minutes of completing the MILD technique, the success rate of lucid dreaming was much higher, at almost 46% of attempts.
“The MILD technique works on what we call ‘prospective memory' — that is, your ability to remember to do things in the future. By repeating a phrase that you will remember you're dreaming, it forms an intention in your mind that you will, in fact, remember that you are dreaming, leading to a lucid dream,” says Dr Aspy, Visiting Research Fellow in the University's School of Psychology.
“Importantly, those who reported success using the MILD technique were significantly less sleep deprived the next day, indicating that lucid dreaming did not have any negative effect on sleep quality,” they say.
“These results take us one step closer to developing highly effective lucid dream induction techniques that will allow us to study the many potential benefits of lucid dreaming, such as treatment for nightmares and improvement of physical skills and abilities through rehearsal in the lucid dream environment,” Dr Aspy says.
Dr Aspy is continuing their research into lucid dreams in an attempt to further increase the effectiveness of the technique. He's conducting a new study, which is open to any English-speaking people aged 18 and over anywhere in the world.

Image caption Nicolas Sarkozy has been under investigation since losing immunity from prosecution when they were defeated in the presidential election last year
French prosecutors are investigating allegations that Libya helped fund Nicolas Sarkozy's successful 2007 presidential election bid.
The inquiry would look at charges of "active and passive corruption", "influence peddling" and other issues, a judicial source told AFP news agency.
The former president was placed under formal investigation last month over claims they received illegal donations from France's richest woman.
Mr Sarkozy denied all the allegations.
They have previously hinted that they might consider another run for the presidency in 2017, but the outcome of these investigations could determine whether they will make a return to politics, observers say.
'Abundant' financing
It was during Nato-led air strikes on Libya in 2011 that Saif al-Islam, son of the then leader Muammar Gaddafi, first accused Mr Sarkozy of taking millions of their father's money for campaign funding.
The claims were supported in December by Lebanese business person Ziad Takieddine, who has long acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East.
They have told judges that they have written proof that Mr Sarkozy's campaign bid was "abundantly" financed by Tripoli, and that the 50m euros (£43m) worth of payments continued after they became president.
Muammar Gaddafi was a guest in Paris in 2007 and afforded every courtesy, even pitching their tent close to the Elysee Palace, the BBC's Christian Fraser reports.
But Mr Sarkozy has always denied any wrongdoing, pointing out that they were the chief advocate of the Nato-led campaign that removed Col Gaddafi from power, they add.
Mr Sarkozy has also vehemently denied taking financial advantage of 90-year-old L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, with whom they forged a close friendship while mayor of the wealthiest suburb in Paris.
It is alleged that staff acting for Mrs Bettencourt gave 150,000 euros (£120,600) in cash to Mr Sarkozy's aides during their successful 2007 campaign to become president. Mrs Bettancourt also denies the allegations.
Police raided Mr Sarkozy's home and offices last July after they lost their presidential immunity following their election defeat to Francois Hollande earlier in the year.
Canada's mortgage insurance agency is reporting a 52 per cent increase in the number of insured home loans in arrears in Alberta, as low oil prices weaken the provincial economy.
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation says in its second-quarter report that payments on 1,487 mortgages in Alberta were three months or more overdue as of June 30 – up from 978 at the same time in 2015.
Saskatchewan's list of troubled mortgages is also up, to 529 from 392, in the same period.
Story continues below advertisement
The numbers are in stark contrast with those in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, which all posted hundreds of fewer loans in arrears in the same period.
Ontario's rate of troubled loans is the lowest in the country at less than a fifth of a percentage point, while Alberta's is 0.41 per cent and Saskatchewan's is 0.69 per cent.
CMHC says its Canadian arrears rate fell slightly over the year but remains at about one-third of one per cent of its portfolio.
The national agency says it provided mortgage insurance for about 135,000 units nationally in the three months ended June 30, up 11 per cent from the same period last year.
Tkachenko is banned from the priesthood for the time of the trial.
The Supreme Court of Yakutia arrested the ex-director of St. Innocent's Orthodox Gymnasium, cleric hieromonk Meletius (Andrey Tkachenko), on charges of pedophilia, the press service of the Yakutsk City Court reported to the agency Interfax-Far East.
"The Supreme Court of Yakutia considered the appeal submitted by lawyer Tkachenko against the decision of the City Court to arrest the priest and rejected it. The defendant is taken into custody and placed in Yakutsk's pre-trial detention center until August 9," the source said. The hearing was held behind the closed doors, and Tkachenko introduced themselves at the trial as "the regular clergyman of the Yakutsk diocese, Hieromonk Meletius."
The press service of the Yakutsk diocesan administration published a message stating that Tkachenko was banned from the service for the period of the trial. "We have not received any complaints from alleged victims, so we have no reason to comment on the situation," the report says.
According to NVK Sakha, Tkachenko stopped managing the Gymnasium in March this year. After the meeting, archbishop Roman of Yakutsk and Lensk thanked Tkachenko for theirs "work". After that, the priest had to go "to guide the flock of the Russian Orthodox Church abroad."
In April, a criminal case was initiated against Tkachenko under item (b), part 4 of Art. 132 of the Russian Criminal Code (Violent Actions of Sexual Character with respect to a person who has not reached the age of fourteen years). Sanctions under the article provide for imprisonment of up to 20 years. In June, Tkachenko was charged with two counts.
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Peabody Energy Corp BTUUQ.PK failed to explain how it will cover future mine cleanup costs in a reorganization plan filed late Thursday, triggering concerns over the company's use of “self-bonds.”

Under a federal program called “self-bonding,” large miners like Peabody have been allowed to extract coal without setting aside cash or collateral to ensure mined land is returned to its natural setting, as required by law.
The practice came under scrutiny following bankruptcy filings by some of the largest U.S. coal miners because, without collateral set aside for mine reclamation, taxpayers are potentially exposed to billions of dollars in cleanup costs.
Environmental groups have been following the bankruptcy to see whether Peabody, the world's largest private-sector coal producer, replaces roughly $1 billion of self-bonds with other guarantees, as rival Arch Coal Inc (ARCH.N) did in its October bankruptcy reorganization.
In Thursday's plan to eliminate over $5 billion of debt to emerge from Chapter 11, Peabody said it will address its “self-bonding reclamation obligations in accordance with applicable laws and regulations,” without providing details.
While a leading U.S. coal regulator has started to toughen rules for guaranteeing mine cleanups, the future of that process under a Trump administration is unclear.
Howard Learner, executive director of the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center, said the reorganization plan dodged the issue of self-bonding, potentially shifting the risk for Peabody's environmental cleanup costs onto the public.
“Peabody should be required to live up to its mine reclamation responsibilities and assure that it will not saddle taxpayers with these costs,” Learner said.
Learner said their organization would fight Peabody's reorganization plan.
Peabody hold self-bonds in Wyoming, New Mexico, Indiana and Illinois, which has expressed concerns about the practice. The company announced a temporary financing deal with the states in July to cover a portion of the risk that it will walk away from mine cleanup obligations while in bankruptcy.
Peabody spokesperson Vic Svec said the company continues to fund its reclamation obligations and was in talks with states as well as third-party surety bonding firms over cleanup coverage.
“Now that we have defined a capital structure through our plan of reorganization, we can firm up components of surety bonding,” Svec said.
In a revised business plan on Friday, Peabody raised its target for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and restructuring (EBITDAR) to $4 billion between 2016 and 2021 from $3.1 billion projected in August, citing a temporary rise in coal prices.
The home that had once been a lonely refuge for a family was buzzing with activity again this week.
Another reporter had just left down the concrete steps after interviewing Shamim Rahman about "Serial," the world's most popular podcast, which has put their son's once-dormant murder conviction on the minds of millions.
Inside their Windsor Mill house on Wednesday night, Rahman and their youngest son, Yusuf Syed, talked excitedly about their plans to watch "Serial" host Sarah Koenig, a former Baltimore Sun staff writer, talk about the case and trade quips with comedian and talk-show host Stephen Colbert in just a few hours on the "The Colbert Report." In their wildest dreams, Shamim Rahman said, they never thought "Serial" would attract as much international attention as it has, giving the family a sense of hope and comfort in a difficult situation.
"It kind of brought us back to life," Yusuf Syed said.
An offshoot of the nationally syndicated radio program "This American Life," "Serial" has spent the past 11 weeks exploring the conviction of Yusuf's older brother, Adnan Syed, a Woodlawn High School student, who was sentenced to life plus 30 years for strangling their ex-girlfriend and classmate, Hae Min Lee, 18, in January 1999. Baltimore prosecutors say Syed became jealous after Lee began dating someone else, and the state used cellphone records and the testimony of one of Adnan's acquaintances, who said they helped bury their body, to get a conviction despite the lack of eyewitnesses or physical evidence linking Adnan to the crime.
For 15 years, Syed Rahman, their wife, Shamim Rahman, and their youngest son, Yusuf Syed, had felt as if they were alone, grappling with the toll that comes from having a family member incarcerated for life. They said they felt socially isolated within their Pakistani Muslim community in Baltimore County and the focus of stares and whispers, real and imagined. The stigma of being related to a murderer was too much to bear, they said, and they became withdrawn.
Although Adnan and their family have maintained their innocence from the start, a conviction carries the stamp of guilt. Shamim said they felt society had no time to hear their concerns about the evidence that had been presented once the jury came back with a guilty verdict.
Hae Min Lee, a Woodlawn High School senior, went missing in 1999. Them body was found nearly a month later. Adnan Syed, classmate and ex-boyfriend, was arrested and found guilty of their murder, though they claim they are innocent. Hae Min Lee, a Woodlawn High School senior, went missing in 1999. Them body was found nearly a month later. Adnan Syed, classmate and ex-boyfriend, was arrested and found guilty of their murder, though they claim they are innocent. SEE MORE VIDEOS
That all changed, they said, when Koenig started re-examining the case after a family friend brought it to her, pointing out a possible alibi that had been ignored, the shifting testimony of a key witness, a difficult-to-prove timeline and questions about the work of Adnan's defense attorney, who ultimately ended up disbarred.
"For 15 years we were in silence, and now the whole world can hear our voice," said Yusuf, 25. "It makes us feel like we're not alone. We're not crazy. We're not the only ones who think he's innocent."
People from as far away as the United Kingdom and Australia — where "Serial" has also been hugely popular — have also questioned Adnan's guilt on social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter.
"Before, it felt like it's just me, my husband and Yusuf," Shamim said. "Now it feels like the whole world."
The family says the podcast and the associated news coverage has been cathartic. Friends have greeted Syed Rahman at the local mosque in tears, saying they didn't realize the emotional burden the family carried all these years. Random people have reached out to Yusuf on Facebook with words of encouragement.
"Feels really good," Syed Rahman said. "Decreases the pain, all of the suffering."
The podcast has even opened the door for family reconciliation.
Tanveer Syed, the Rahmans' oldest son, became estranged from the family shortly after the trial, partly because of the stress and strain, Shamim Rahman said. But since "Serial" began airing, they said, they have visited the family almost every week, bringing their wife and three children. The elder son is now in the process of moving to Hagerstown from Philadelphia to be closer to them.
Yusuf said they saw a dream realized just last week when their mother, father, Tanveer and their family all sat together in the upstairs living room at a time when Adnan happened to call from their Western Maryland prison.
"In my dream, I always wanted my family to be here," Yusuf said. "We were all back together."
"Serial" has caught the attention of multiple Reddit groups, comedians who've made YouTube parodies, other podcasts and online magazines that recount each episode, as well as traditional news outlets such as CNN and the "Today" show. Not everyone is pleased with the attention.
A man claiming to be Hae Min Lee's brother surfaced on Reddit last month and expressed their disgust at the fervor many "Serial" fans seem to have.
"TO ME ITS REAL LIFE," wrote the man purporting to be Lee's younger brother, Young Lee. (Young Lee had declined to be interviewed for "Serial" and could not be reached by The Sun.) "To you listeners, its another murder mystery, crime drama, another episode of CSI. You weren't there to see your mom crying every night, having a [heart attack] when they got the [news] that the body was found, and going to court almost everyday for a year seeing your mom weeping, crying and fainting. You don't know what we went through. ... you guys are disgusting. Shame on you. I pray that you don't have to go through what we went through and have your story blasted to [5 million] listeners."
Yusuf Syed said they empathize with the account, especially when they read just how Hae's mother had struggled with their death.
"I felt bad for him. They still lost their sister, and whatever happens, it won't bring their sister back," Yusuf said. "I think the sensationalization doesn't come from us or from Sarah [Koenig], it comes from the people like the Redditers, the people on Facebook. They're the ones treating it like its just a story."
The Sun made extensive efforts working with Koenig this summer to contact Hae's family over several weeks, but relatives could not be found.
Rabia Chaudry, the family friend and immigration attorney who first emailed Koenig the story idea for "Serial," said they understand the rabidness fans have shown waiting each week for a new episode to be released. But they don't understand the certainty many have shown that they know what really happened in 1999.
The oath an American president recites upon taking office includes the famous promise to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
Interestingly, one of the first decisions a new president makes is which version of the presidential oath to take.
That's because the paragraph in the Constitution that includes the presidential oath gives the president a simple, but potentially significant, choice of words.
That paragraph, in Article II, Section 1 , says:
Before they enter on the Execution of their Office, they shall take the following Oath or Affirmation: — “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
The option to either “swear” or “affirm” partly reflects the fact that some Founding Fathers were devout Christians and some weren't. Thus, if the religious term “swear” didn't fit a president's philosophy, they could say “affirm.”
On April 30, 1789 , at their inauguration ceremony in New York City, George Washington became the first person to take the presidential oath.
Washington was a Christian. They chose to use the word “swear,” as every president except one has since then.
The exception was Franklin Pierce, who decided to say “affirm.”
Most presidents have also taken their oath while placing their hand on a Bible. However, nothing in the U.S. Constitution requires that.
It's a tradition started by George Washington, who recited the oath with their hand on a Masonic Bible at their inauguration.
Although Masonic Bibles have since gone out of style, most presidents have sworn their oath with their hand on a Bible. I suspect this is partly to honor tradition and partly to avoid any controversy.
However, there have been some notable non-traditionalists.
John Quincy Adams took the oath with their hand on a book of law.
Theodore Roosevelt decided not to use a Bible or any other book when they recited the oath at their inauguration.
There has long been a debate about whether George Washington also started the tradition of saying “So help me God” after reciting the presidential oath.
Prof. Peter R. Henriques, author of the book Realistic Visionary: A Portrait of George Washington , wrote an interesting article about this debate that's posted on the History News Network .
They concluded there's no proof Washington actually said “So help me God.”
Apparently, the first American president to do so was Chester A. Arthur, at their inauguration in 1881.
That's essentially the only thing Arthur ever said that might be considered a famous quotation. Unfortunately for him, Washington is the one who usually (and probably wrongly) gets credit for it.

Glassfish 4.1 won't start in Yosemite 10.10.3
Torbjørn Kristoffersen Blocked Unblock Follow Apr 21, 2015
After upgrading to Yosemite 10.10.3, it appears that Glassfish will no longer start using the following command:
bin/asadmin start-domain domain1
JVM failed to start: com.sun.enterprise.admin.launcher.GFLauncherException: The server exited prematurely with exit code 0.
Before it died, it produced the following output:
Command start-domain failed.
That's slightly uncool. Not even an error message?
It turns out that the Glassfish team made an assumption that they could use launchctl bsexec in their nucleus/admin/launcher/src/main/java/com/sun/enterprise/admin/launcher/GFLauncher.java file.
This sub-command now requires root privileges.
Someone has submitted a patch to Glassfish trunk, but if you want to continue using Glassfish immediately, you can create this script somewhere e.g. ~/bin/launchctl.
#!/bin/bash
# A little hack to wrap launchctl in order to
# successfully start Glassfish on Yosemite 10.10.3+
if [[ ${1} == "bsexec" ]]; then
nohup ${@:3}
else
/bin/launchctl ${@}
fi
Remember to ‘chmod 755 ~/bin/launchctl' so that it is executable.
Also remember that your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile must have something like this:
export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
The idea here is that this script is a wrapper for launchctl. As a user in Yosemite 10.10.3, you cannot run bsexec, but you may want to use launchctl for other things.

Apple announces Mac VR support and strong internal/external graphics solutions
At WWDC 2017 Apple has started to take GPU performance seriously, announcing new systems with strong, VR-ready GPU solutions as well as a new Thunderbolt 3 enclosure which will contain up to an RX 580 GPU.
This brings Apple's upcoming products gaming capable levels of GPU performance, which will be useful for both developers and gamers alike who crave some additional performance from GPU acceleration.
Apple has also announced their new Metal 2 API, with additional optimisation that can deliver up to 10x greater draw call input, though at this time it is unclear how widely this new API will be used by software developers.
Apple has also announced new iMAC Retina models with Radeon Pro 555 or 560 GPU as well as iMAC 5K systems with Radeon Pro 570, 575 and 580 GPU models. Combine this with Apple's upgrades to modern Kaby Lake Intel CPUs and we can see some significant performance improvements when compared to the companies existing systems.
Apple has also announced plans to use AMD's Radeon Vega GPU in a future iMac Pro system, which will be combined with Intel's upcoming X299 CPUs.
You can join the discussion on Apple's new VR Ready Radeon-powered Macs on the OC3D Forums.

Containers as kernel objects
This article brought to you by LWN subscribers Subscribers to LWN.net made this article — and everything that surrounds it — possible. If you appreciate our content, please buy a subscription and make the next set of articles possible.
The kernel has, over the years, gained comprehensive support for containers; that, in turn, has helped to drive the rapid growth of a number of containerization systems. Interestingly, though, the kernel itself has no concept of what a container is; it just provides a number of facilities that can be used in the creation of containers in user space. David Howells is trying to change that state of affairs with a patch set adding containers as a first-class kernel object, but the idea is proving to be a hard sell in the kernel community.
Containers can be thought of as a form of lightweight virtualization. Processes running within a container have the illusion of running on an independent system but, in truth, many containers can be running simultaneously on the same host kernel. The container illusion is created using namespaces, giving each container its own view of the network, the filesystem, and more, and control groups, which isolate containers from each other and control resource usage. Security modules or seccomp can be used to further restrict what a container can do. The result is a mechanism that, like so many things in Linux, offers a great deal of flexibility at the cost of a fair amount of complexity. Setting up a container in a way that ensures it will stay contained is not a trivial task and, as we'll see, the lack of a container primitive also complicates things on the kernel side.
Adding a container object
Howells's patch creates (or modifies) a set of system calls to make it possible for user space to manipulate containers. It all starts with:
int container_create(const char *name, unsigned int flags);
This new system call creates a container with the given name . The flags mainly specify which namespaces from the caller should be replaced by new namespaces in the created container. For example, specifying CONTAINER_NEW_USER_NS will cause the container to be created with a new user namespace. The return value is a file descriptor that can be used to refer to the container. There are a couple of flags that indicate whether the container should be destroyed when the file descriptor is closed, and whether the descriptor should be closed if the calling process calls exec() .
The container starts out empty, with no processes running within it; if it is created with a new mount namespace, there are no filesystems mounted inside it either. Two new system calls ( fsopen() and fsmount() , added in a separate patch set) can be used to add filesystems to the container. The "at" versions of the file system calls ( openat() , for example) can take a container file descriptor as the starting point, easing the creation of files inside the container. It is possible to open a socket within the container with:
int container_socket(int container_fd, int domain, int type, int protocol);
The main purpose of container_socket() appears to be to make it easy to use netlink sockets to configure the container's networking from the outside. It can help an orchestration system avoid the need to run a process inside the container to do this configuration.
When it comes time to start things running inside the container, a call can be made to:
pid_t fork_into_container(int container_fd);
The new process created by this call will be the init process inside the given container, and will run inside the container's namespaces. It can only be called once for any given container.
There are a number of things that, Howells said, could still be added to this mechanism. They include the ability to set a container's namespaces directly, support for the management of a container's control groups, the ability to suspend and restart a container, and more. But it is not clear that this work will progress far in its current form.
A poor match?
A number of developers expressed concerns about this proposal, mostly focused on two issues: the proposed container object is not seen as a good match for how containers are actually used now, and it is seen as the wrong solution to a specific problem. On the first issue, the flexibility of the current mechanisms is seen by many as an advantage, one that they would rather not lose. Jessica Frazelle said:
Adding a container object seems a bit odd to me because there are so many different ways to make containers, aka not all namespaces are always used as well as not all cgroups, various LSM objects sometimes apply, mounts blah blah blah. The OCI spec was made to cover all these things so why a kernel object?
Here, they were referring to the runtime specification from the Open Containers Initiative. James Bottomley was more direct, saying that:
This sounds like a step in the wrong direction: the strength of the current container interfaces in Linux is that people who set up containers don't have to agree what they look like. So I can set up a user namespace without a mount namespace or an architecture emulation container with only a mount namespace.
They pointed out, in particular, an apparent mismatch between the proposed container object and the concepts of containers and "pods" implemented in Kubernetes. Some namespaces are specific to a container, while others are shared across a pod, blurring the boundaries somewhat. The kernel container object, they added, "isn't something the orchestration systems would find usable".
Eric Biederman took an even stronger position by rejecting the patch outright. As they put it:
Embracing the complexity of namespaces head on tends to mean all of the goofy scary semantic corner cases are visible from the first version of the design, and so developers can't take short cuts that result in buggy kernel code that persists for decades. I am rather tired of finding and fixing those.
Unlike the others, they are not so deeply concerned with what existing orchestration systems do; their worries have to do with the exposing of the container object to user space at all. That is where the second issue comes up.
Upcalls
To a great extent, it appears that the motivation behind this patch set isn't to make the management of containers easier for user-space code. Instead, it is trying to solve a nagging problem that has become increasingly irritating for kernel developers: how to make kernel "upcalls" work properly in a containerized environment.
As a general rule, the kernel, as the lowest level of the system, tries to be self-sufficient in all things. There really is nobody else to rely on to get things done, after all. There are times, though, when the kernel has to ask user space for help. That is typically done with a call to call_usermodehelper() , an internal function that will create a user-space process and run a specific program to get something done — "calling up" to user space, in other words.
There are a number of call_usermodehelper() call sites in the kernel. Some of the tasks it is used for include:
The core-dump code can use it to invoke a program to do something useful with the dumped data.
The NFSv4 client can call a helper program to perform DNS resolution.
The module loader can invoke a helper to perform demand-loading of modules.
The kernel's key-management code will call to user space when a key is needed to perform a specific function — to mount an encrypted filesystem, for example.
Once upon a time, when life was simple, these upcalls would create a process running as root that could run the requested program. Now, however, the action that provoked the upcall in the first place may well have come from inside a container, and it may well be that the upcall should run within that container as well. At least, it should run inside that container's particular mix of namespaces. But, since the kernel has no concept of a container, it has no way to know which container to run any particular upcall within. A kernel upcall that is run in the wrong namespace might do the wrong thing — or allow a process to escape its container.
Adding a container concept to the kernel is one way to fix this problem. But this particular patch has raised questions of whether (1) a container object is the best solution to the upcall problem, and (2) if a container object does make sense, does it need to be exposed to user space? The kernel might be able to keep track of the proper namespaces to use for specific upcalls without creating a bunch of new infrastructure or exposing a new API that would have to be maintained forever. Biederman suggested one possible scheme that could be used to track namespaces for the key-management upcalls, for example.
Another possible approach, proposed by Colin Walters, is to drop the upcall model entirely. Instead, a protocol could be created to report events to a user-space daemon that could act on them in the proper context. That kind of change has been made in the past; device-related events were once handled via upcalls, but now they are communicated directly to the udev (or systemd-udevd ) process instead. But, as Jeff Layton pointed out, that model only works in some settings. In others, it just leads to a proliferation of daemon processes that clutter up the system and can create reliability issues. So the events model isn't necessarily a replacement for all kernel upcalls.
This discussion is young as of this writing, and may yet progress in unexpected directions. From the early indications, it seems relatively unlikely that a container object visible to user space will be added to the kernel anytime soon. If, perhaps, some future attempt creates a container concept that is useful to existing orchestration systems, that could change. Meanwhile, we may well see an attempt to improve the kernel's internal ability to determine the proper namespace for any given upcall. Either way, the inherent complexity of the container problem seems likely to be with us for a long time.

The first panel of a monument to the 5,000 Liverpool Pals who served in World War I has been completed ready for casting.
Made by sculptor Tom Murphy it will be one of a pair showing scenes from the volunteer soldiers' story that will be displayed in Lime Street Station.
Fundraisers for the artwork still have around £35,000 of a total £80,000 to find to ensure it will be finished for next year's 100th anniversary of the Pals enlisting on August 31.

The Pals were not regular soldiers but mostly office staff who responded to an appeal by war secretary Lord Kitchener and Lord Derby for 100,000 volunteers to serve in northern France.
Liverpool was the first city to step forward with 1,050 men recruited at St George's Hall by 10am on August 31, 1914.
They arrived in such numbers thousands had to be asked to return to sign up.
Mr Murphy, whose public artworks include the Hillsborough memorial at the bottom of William Brown Street, said: “It's important that we remember the Liverpool Pals. I don't think people in the city realise how many people we lost.
“A friend of mine came to see the panel and said ‘that's what happened to my grandfather, they were kissed goodbye at the station and was never seen again'.”
The Pals took part in some of the bloodiest battles of World War I including the Somme, Arras and Passchendaele. More than 2,800 did not return home.
The 15ft wide monument's first panel shows several scenes from the men queuing up to enlist, through their training at locations such as Knowsley Hall and Kitchener's visit to Liverpool, to their departure from Lime Street Station.
The second will depict the wounded and dead in the French battlefields and the survivors' return to Lime Street, where one of Kitchener's famous finger-pointing posters will lie crumpled on the platform.
A silicone rubber mould will now be made from the first clay panel which in turn will be used to cast the finished work in resin. The completed piece will have the appearance of bronze.
Bill Sergeant, of the Liverpool Pals Memorial Fund, said: “After Kitchener made their appeal Liverpool was the first to respond. Manchester was next and other cities followed.
“In Tom's piece there is a contrast between the scene of joy as the Pals are sent off to war and the dismal picture of them returning often wounded in much smaller numbers than they left.”
The Liverpool Pals Memorial Fund was launched last year with the re-enactment of a parade made in 1915 by the men who volunteered to fight.

Unicorn and startup superpower Autodesk rocks out to new metal as XJet promises to revolutionize and strengthen the phenomenon of using nano-materials in 3D printing
Truly metal startup XJet, whose name should be envied by every startup everywhere ever, announced it had attracted $25 million Thursday. The round was led by Autodesk, Inc., a leader in 3D design engineering and entertainment software through its Spark Investment Fund, and the Israeli-Chinese CEL Fund. The round is substantial, but it's of extra significance as a major commitment from the foremost 3D design and engineering startup in the world.
“XJet is the first company to succeed in using 3D inkjet printing to make metal parts of the highest quality,” said Dror Danai, XJet CBO and 3D printing industry veteran. “This area has great potential to meet the growing demand for producing short runs of metal parts. XJet's innovative technology uses metal nano-particles which generate precision parts with complex geometries for use in a variety of applications in aerospace, automotive, medicine, dental and other industries.”
Their system deposits extremely thin layers of liquid drops that contain metallic nano-particles onto a special tray. As their machines heat up the material, the liquid evaporates, leaving the nano-metal bound “with virtually the same metallurgy as traditionally-made metal parts” according to XJet's website.
The company is based in Rehovot, Israel, also the home of the world-renown Weizmann Institute of Science. XJet's flagship product and service is its NanoParticle JettingTM that builds metallic parts out of nano-particles resting in liquid suspension. The company pivoted from a focus on solar technologies toward nano-metallic printing over the last two years, a growing field with the potential to remake a number of conventional products like cell phone screens.
Autodesk is a well-known titan of the startup world and one of its reigning unicorns. The investment was made through their Spark Investment Fund. So far, the $100 million fund has played it conservative. Carbon3D got $11 million in 2013, MatterFace received $5.75 million in May, Voxel8 garnered $12 million in July, and Source3 got $4 million in September. The Catalyst CEL Fund launched early in 2016 as the first Israeli-Chinese VC and private equity fund to promote Beijing investments in Israeli startups. Fund manager Yair Shamir will take over as Chairman of the Board at XJet.
XJet was founded in 2005 by serial entrepreneur Hanan Gothait (Objet Geometries) and currently employs some 60 people, among them 50 “multidisciplinary” R&D specialists. The company has also filed 50 patent claims since its founding. Investors include Alumot (which led a $22 million round in 2014), Gemini Israel Ventures, Landa Ventures, Applied Materials, Good Energies and other Chinese investors.
“This additional round of funding is another vote of confidence in XJet and will ensure our position as a leader in the 3D metal printing arena,” said Gothait. “We believe that XJet will redefine the production of short-runs of complex metal parts in major areas of production.”
Tom brady won their fourth Super Bowl title with the Patriots. (Photo11: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)
Electronics Arts' track record in predicting the winner of the Super Bowl through a simulation of video game Madden NFL is pretty solid. Entering Super Bowl XLIX, the Madden sim boasts an 8-3 record.
Make that 9-3, following the New England Patriots' win over the Seattle Seahawks. However, the way this year's Madden sim predicted the outcome of Super Bowl XLIX is downright scary.
Let's start with the final score: 28-24, which the Madden sim guessed exactly. Impressive, yes. But it gets better. Some highlights:
The Madden sim predicted Tom Brady would win Super Bowl MVP (which they did), passing for 335 yards and 4 touchdowns. Brady finished the game with 328 yards and 4 touchdowns. The simulation missed by only seven yards.
As for that game-winner, the Madden sim also predicted New England would trail 24-14 in the third quarter before staging a comeback, capped by a game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Julian Edelman. Yep, Madden nailed that one, too.
The simulation had Edelman finish as the Patriots' top receiver, with eight catches for 106 yards. Edelman ended the Super Bowl with nine catches for 109 yards.
Translation: The Madden sim is kinda good at predicting Super Bowls.

A federal judge in Oklahoma ruled Tuesday that the state's constitutional amendment barring same-sex marriage violated the federal Constitution, the latest in a string of legal victories for gay rights and one that occurred in the heart of the Bible Belt.
The state's ban on marriage by gay and lesbian couples is “an arbitrary, irrational exclusion of just one class of Oklahoma citizens from a governmental benefit,” wrote Judge Terence C. Kern of United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, in Tulsa, deciding a case that had languished for nine years. The amendment, they said, is based on “moral disapproval” and does not advance the state's asserted interests in promoting heterosexual marriage or the welfare of children.
“We're jubilant, we're over the moon,” said one of the plaintiffs, Sharon Baldwin, 45, who has lived with their partner and co-plaintiff, Mary Bishop, 52, for 17 years.
The two both work as editors at The Tulsa World newspaper and had just arrived at work on Tuesday afternoon when the city editor told them of the decision.
“We're taking the day off,” Ms. Baldwin said.
Of the remaining 13 percent, it found, “three-quarters report they are not working in order to care for family members and the rest report other reasons, like being laid off.” Most other able-bodied people already receiving Medicaid before the expansion are also working, raising the question of what problem, exactly, the proposed requirement is meant to solve.
In fact, the Republicans get the issue backward: Medicaid already supports work. As a recent study of Medicaid in Ohio put it, recipients “reported that Medicaid has made it easier to secure and maintain employment.” A woman who was suffering from a severe hernia was unable to get out of bed. Once on Medicaid, they got the surgery they needed and reported being “back to work and feeling much better.”
Republicans typically deny this reality, in part because they've convinced themselves that the work requirements in the welfare reform bill of 1996 were effective in increasing employment among single mothers. However, research suggests those gains were driven more by strong demand for low-wage labor in the late 1990s and by the expansion of the earned-income tax credit.
The strongest evidence for this is what happened when that uniquely welcoming labor market disappeared. Welfare reform and its work requirements remain in place, but the employment rates for single mothers have fallen consistently since 2000. That result jibes with findings from other studies showing that any increases in employment following the introduction of work requirements are small and short-lived, and that such requirements fail to improve low-income people's employment prospects in the long run.
So what do work requirements do? At best, they encourage people who were going to work anyway to do so a little sooner, perhaps shaving a few weeks off the time they are unemployed. But more important, they terminate needed benefits for people facing significant barriers to employment.
The inside story of how close Jose Mourinho came to becoming manager of Liverpool
In the days before they were shushing their fans at cup finals, ruining their title dreams and prompting a mixture of fear and loathing whenever they come to town, there was a time when Jose Mourinho did not just want Liverpool, they wanted them so badly that they dispatched a trusted emissary to Anfield in an attempt to secure the manager's job.
For all the hostility that their return to the stadium with Manchester United on Monday night will inevitably prompt, their increasingly troubled, tempestuous relationship with Liverpool was founded upon unrequited affection.
On the opposite end of the M62, March 9, 2004 will always be remembered as the day that Mourinho, then manager of FC Porto, announced themselves to English football in typically provocative fashion by charging along the touchline at Old Trafford after Costinha's last minute equaliser had eliminated United from the Champions League. It was a landmark moment and one that underlined Mourinho's status as arguably Europe's most formidable young manager.
At Liverpool, though, recollections of that day are different. Hours before Mourinho had enhanced their own reputation and antagonised the Old Trafford crowd, their representative had turned up at Anfield on a mission to convince the Merseyside club that the Porto coach should become their next manager. Liverpool had not sought the advances of Mourinho's camp but they got them anyway.
The man bringing the approach was Jorge Baideck, Mourinho's agent at the time. Having travelled to Manchester ahead of the last 16 tie, Baideck made use of the hours before the game to head to Merseyside with a colleague, a French agent who had been involved in a number of recent deals with Liverpool.
Officially, the purpose of their visit was to discuss potential transfers with Gerard Houllier, Liverpool's then manager, but although that meeting took place, the real reason for being there was still to materialise.
That only happened after Rick Parry, Liverpool's chief executive at the time, took a phone call from the French agent asking if they were at their office at Anfield and whether they had time for a coffee. Parry confirmed that they were available and the pair made their way from Melwood, Liverpool's training ground, to Anfield, discussing how to approach the encounter en route.
Although Parry had found the request for an impromptu meeting strange, particularly as they would usually have expected to have been involved in the transfer talks that had already taken place with Houllier, they reasoned that they had nothing to lose by at least hearing what they had to say.

After announcing themselves to Parry's secretary, Baideck and their associate were shown into their office situated at the Kop end of the stadium. Small talk ensued before Baideck got straight to the point with a very simple and straightforward statement: “Jose Mourinho would like to come and manage Liverpool.”
It was the kind of message that could have changed history, particularly that of Liverpool and Chelsea, and Baideck was determined to leave Parry in no doubt that it was one that they should act upon.
A full charm offensive ensured. Mourinho was a huge admirer of Liverpool and was enchanted by the idea of working at Anfield, a venue that they had long revered. Club and manager would be the perfect fit, Baideck continued. Not only was their client interested, they were so keen that they had identified Liverpool has their ideal destination once their departure from Porto was confirmed. The seriousness of the approach was clear. Liverpool were in the enviable position of having one of football management's rising stars telling them that they were the ones they wanted.
The problem was – and this was a significant one for a club which prided itself on doing things the right way and following their own procedures – Liverpool already had a manager in place and it was the same one whom Baideck had met with hours earlier. In terms of professional etiquette and common decency, there was something about Baideck's brazen attempt to see their own client oust Houllier just hours after trying to sell players to the Frenchman which did not sit well with the Anfield hierarchy.
Although Houllier's position was coming under mounting pressure by that stage, Liverpool were a distant sixth in the Premier League table at the time of Baideck's visit, no decision had been taken to replace him. Instead, their focus had been on ensuring there were no distractions that could derail Houllier's attempt to guide Liverpool into the top four and secure a place in the following season's Champions League. If there was going to be any managerial upheaval it was not going to happen then.
Liverpool's attitude was that while such overt interest from a manager of Mourinho's quality was welcome, any review of their own manager's position would not take place until the end of the season at the time when the Portuguese was set to leave Porto. There would be no rash decisions and no entering into clandestine negotiations which, if revealed, would have undermined Houllier and potentially derailed their push for the top four.
Furthermore, while no tears were shed on Merseyside when Mourinho celebrated United's demise with a gratuitous touchline dash, their antics did not sit well with the Liverpool hierarchy who were not overly enamoured by the prospect of having a manager who was capable of behaviour that did not fit in with the club's values. What Baideck had presented as a marriage made in heaven during an impassioned sales pitch was not ringing any wedding bells at Anfield. The proposal had been made but there would be no rushing into things.
While Liverpool were not willing to make a commitment at that stage, Chelsea, who had already resolved to dispense with the services of Claudio Ranieri at the end of that season, were in a position to do so. Armed with the wealth of Roman Abramovich and determined to become a major power at home and abroad, the London club made an offer to Mourinho via Jorge Mendes and a deal was swiftly concluded. Not only did Baidek's Liverpool vision remain unfulfilled, they also lost their star client to Mendes.
Given their subsequent success at Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, Mourinho is more than entitled to believe that missing out on the Liverpool was hardly a setback regardless of how much they had coveted it. But whether Liverpool has any cause for regret is also open for debate. While Steven Gerrard freely admits their own regret at not having worked with Mourinho, the overriding sense at Anfield is that despite a respect for the 53-year-old's achievements there is no guarantee that they could have thrived with them as they as at other clubs.
Fundamental to that viewpoint is an acceptance that the financial resources available to Liverpool managers fell short of the riches available at Abramovich's Chelsea during Mourinho's first spell in charge. While Rafael Benitez, who succeeded Houllier, spent £19 million on players in their first summer at Anfield, Chelsea were lavishing more than £100 million on new signings. And despite the playing field being less than level, Liverpool went on to reach the Champions League Final at the expense of Mourinho's Chelsea and win it in glorious fashion in Istanbul at the end of that season.
Could Mourinho have bettered that achievement? Could they have been the manager to bring Liverpool's lengthening wait to be crowned champions to an end instead of the one who scuppered their hopes in 2014? Questions like those will always remain imponderables but what is not in any doubt is that they wanted to find out for themselves so while they will arrive at Anfield as the enemy on Monday night they could so easily have been Liverpool's leader.

Ecoregions of the Midwest
By Jeffery Robichaud
I spent a couple of weeks this summer with my family on the beach in North Carolina. I'm not the most social fellow in vacation settings, so I spent most of the time splashing in the waves with my sons. Occasionally, I was forced into some small talk with locals at attractions while waiting for the boys to complete a ride. Invariably, the question, “Where ya from?” would enter the conversation. Whether I answered Kansas, Missouri, Kansas City, or the Midwest the responses were all the same…”really flat out there isn't it…lots of corn huh?” (I'm choosing to leave out comments about the Royals as there is no need to kick them when they are down).
Yes Kansas is flat. Yes we grow lots of corn in this part of the country. But our four-State Region is not just a boring landscape of monoculture and interstate. We have a tremendous diversity of unique ecosystems; from the Sandhills of Nebraska to the Mingo Swamp of the Missouri bootheel….from the Flint Hills of Kansas to the Prairie Potholes of Iowa.
Over twenty years ago James Omernik with EPA's Office of Research and Development worked with colleagues at EPA and with other organizations throughout the country to develop a map of Ecoregions for the United States.
Designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research assessment, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components, ecoregions denote areas within which ecosystems (and the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources) are generally similar. By recognizing the spatial differences in the capacities and potentials of ecosystems, ecoregions stratify the environment by its probable response to disturbance. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernmental organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas.
You can get a copy of EPA's Level 3 Ecoregions (the most commonly used Ecoregion) for the entire country as a zipped shapefile here, as well as the metadata here, and symbology here. Download them and see for yourself how many different ecosystems we have here in Region 7. Or drop us a comment. Last week I mentioned we were packing up maps and wouldn't you know, we found extra copies of unused wall sized Level III Ecoregion maps of Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska which could sure use good homes.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) told Congress yesterday that in addition to a possible gap in data from NOAA's polar-orbiting weather satellites, a similar gap in data from its geostationary satellites could also occur. It also told two House subcommittees that NOAA's cost estimate for its new polar-orbiting satellites actually was $14.6 billion, not the $12.9 billion figure NOAA uses publicly. That figure is a cap imposed by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and NOAA is taking action to reduce costs to meet that target.
NOAA operates weather satellites in polar orbits that circle the entire globe as well as in geostationary orbits that maintain a fixed position over the equator. The current generations are called Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). NOAA was part of a tri-agency program to build new polar orbiting satellites called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), but that program failed and NOAA is now embarked upon its own Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). NASA manages the acquisition of those satellites through a reimburseable arrangement with NOAA. Separately, NOAA is developing a new generation of GOES satellites — the GOES-R series.
GAO's David Powner told two subcommittees of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee that, overall, both of those weather satellite programs are doing better than in the past, but that does not mean they are trouble free. The biggest surprise of the hearing was Powner's statement that NOAA has only a 48 percent confidence level that GOES-R, the first of four satellites in the series, will meet its launch date in October 2015. A potential delay in the shipment of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper was cited as one schedule risk factor.
Concern has been focused on a potential data gap for the polar orbiting satellites. NOAA's existing POES satellites already are getting old. A NASA satellite, NPP Suomi, designed and built as a technology testbed for the NPOESS program, is being repurposed as an operational weather satellite to provide data between now and when the first JPSS is launched. That is scheduled for the spring of 2017, but there is concern that it will not be on orbit with its instruments properly calibrated and validated before NPP Suomi ceases operations. Powner said a 17-month data gap is the best case scenario if NPP Suomi lasts five years and JPSS-1 keeps its 2017 launch date.
Powner also revealed at the hearing that NOAA's actual cost estimate for JPSS was $14.6 billion, but OMB told NOAA it could only have $12.9 billion. NOAA refers to that as a “cap” and it is $1 billion higher than what NOAA told Congress last year. It includes sunk costs in NPOESS, two JPSS satellites, two additional small satellites for instruments that cannot be accommodated on JPSS, and operations through 2028. NOAA explained earlier this year that the $1 billion increase is because it extended the operational period from 2024 to 2028, so the lifecycle cost estimate covers an additional four years of operations.
Stung by the NPOESS fiasco where years of cost overruns and schedule delays ultimately led the White House to kill the program in February 2010, Congress views this new $1 billion increase with alarm, however. The Senate Appropriations Committee lambasted NOAA in its report (S. Rept. 112-158) on the FY2013 Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) bill and called for the weather satellite programs to be transferred to NASA because of NOAA's management shortcomings. NOAA would still operate the satellites once in orbit, but NASA would otherwise be responsible for them.
NOAA's Deputy Administrator Kathy Sullivan and NASA's Marcus Watkins, Director of the Joint Agency Satellite Division, declined to tell the subcommittees what the Obama Administration's position is on the Senate proposal. Both insisted that the Administration is studying the implications and not yet ready to take a position. Watkins' division serves as the acquisition agent for NOAA's satellites, managing the contracts for the satellites and associated launch vehicles. NOAA reimburses NASA for those activities today, but under the Senate Appropriations Committee's plan, NASA would be completely in charge and the money would be appropriated to NASA rather than NOAA.
Powner emphasized the $1.7 billion “funding gap” for JPSS between NOAA's estimate of $14.6 billion and OMB's cap of $12.9 billion. A GAO report released simultaneously with the hearing discloses the options NOAA is considering to cope with that shortfall. Sullivan said they have “high confidence” that the measures NOAA is taking to get down to the $12.9 billion figure will be successful, but that it also needs “very high and continued scrutiny.”
Sullivan and Watkins were asked about the potential impact on JPSS and GOES-R of a Continuing Resolution (CR) that goes beyond the first quarter of FY2013. Congress routinely passes CRs when it cannot complete action on the regular appropriations bills by the beginning of a fiscal year on October 1. CRs generally hold agencies to their previous year funding levels. Agencies have become accustomed to CRs for that last one-three months, but problems can develop if they last longer. Sullivan and Watkins indicated that JPSS probably would be OK under even a long-term CR since the requested funding level for FY2013 is almost the same as what it received for FY2012 (just over $900 million). GOES-R, however, needs a “bump” in FY2013 to begin acquiring a launch vehicle. The GOES-R request for FY2013 is $802 million compared to the $616 million it received for FY2012. If it is held at the FY2012 level, there could be “severe negative impacts” to the program's cost and schedule, Watkins said.
A webcast of the hearing and prepared statements are available on the committee's website.
On a scorching hot day last July, I wandered off the motorway into Belgrade and past crumbling tower blocks and up the steps to what was once an impressive villa. Now the steps were cracked and the fountain was dry and empty. I was entering the Mausoleum of Tito, the Communist ruler of Yugoslavia from 1945 to 1980. Beside their final resting place was an information centre, part of which was dedicated to Yugoslavia's experiment in Worker Self-Management, as it was called. It was here that I was introduced to an idea I had never considered before, that of workers democratically running their workplace the same way democracy runs the government. Did this novel experiment work?
Some quick notes beforehand. First of all it's not easy to research Yugoslavia as few books and articles have been written about it or translated into English. In fact the vast majority of people don't know anything about Yugoslavia. My university library had only a single book on Yugoslavia and self-management. It was written in 1970 and last taken out in 1983. Almost all of the articles I found were written in the 70s and 80s. During the Col War, statistics became a propaganda tool so they should not always be taken at face value (I don't know if Yugoslavia was as bad as the Eastern Bloc and have to trust that the academics took this into account). Another problem is that the system was constantly being reformed and changed which makes comparison difficult.
Before considering the success or failure of self-management we must first put it in context. Yugoslavia was devastated by the war with only China, Soviet Union and Germany suffering more casualties. It was also an overwhelmingly agrarian and underdeveloped society, which would pose trouble for any economic system. It was an extremely divided society comprised of Slovenes, Croats, Bosnians, Serbs, Montenegrins, Macedonians and Kosovars. There were large regional differences with the Northern area of Slovenia and Croatia being much richer than Southern Yugoslavia in present day Serbia and Macedonia. It was only the iron rule of Tito that kept the country united and after their death there was major ethnic conflict. Finally it was a Communist dictatorship. While it was more liberal than the Eastern Bloc, it was still a one party state without free speech or a properly functioning market.
Yugoslavia tried to position itself between the capitalism of the United States and the state planning of the Soviet Union. So while it was more market based than the Communist countries, it was still prone to interference by the Communist party. The economic history of Yugoslavia can be broken into 4 time frames. From 1945-50 Yugoslavia followed the example of the Soviet Union in terms of state planning and collectivisation like the rest of Eastern Europe. However, by 1950 they had split with the Soviet Union and set up their own model of self-management which they followed from 1950-65. However there was still a large degree of state control. It wasn't until the reforms in the 60s that the system became more market based and the self-managed firms became more independent. This period lasted from roughly 1965 until 1974 when the Communist Party began to fear the independence of the self-management firms and constrained their power, moving to a system based on negotiation (i.e. collusion and cronyism) which lasted until Yugoslavia collapsed.
The idea of self-management was essentially to make every firm in the country a co-operative. All the staff would elect a workers council which would act like a board of directors, appoint managers and deal with the affairs of the company. Every worker would have one vote regardless of position, pay, experience or qualification. Instead of receiving wages, the profits of the company would be shared among the staff. The intention is that neither the state (as in the Soviet Union) nor private capitalists (as in America) but rather the worker should run the business. It was described by Archie Brown as “more impressive in theory than practice.”
The workers council would pick its membership from the staff of the firm who would serve for a year. This presumes there are enough qualified people to serve, which is not always the case. There was particularly a scarcity of trained professionals in firms, mainly due to the poverty and underdevelopment of Yugoslavia. As worker council meetings take place after hours and are not paid, they were often seen as a burden or a chore. There is also the theory (known as the Iron Law of Oligarchy) that a in any grouping a handful of people will dominate and be continuously serving on councils. It was found that professionals often dominated the management. Positions run the risk of being popularity contests rather than based on skill.
By its very nature, self-management is dependent on the staff of the firm. If they are energetic and enthusiastic it will likely be a success. If they are disengaged or incompetent, it will likely be a failure. It is therefore hard to generalise about something that is highly dependent on local factors. It was found that participation would initially be high before dropping off over time. Workers were also more engaged in issues that they could relate to. The largest determinate would be the skills and creativity of the firm. Therefore there will be a large variance in the results of self-management. This problem also occurs in capitalism, with some successful and some incompetent managers. Which is the exception and which is the rule?
Self-management was initially immensely successful. After the Second World War, Yugoslavia was one of the fastest growing economies in the world, regularly matching Japan. Between 1952 and 1979 growth averaged 6% a year. Interestingly, Estrin has noted that growth was highest during the 50s and early 60s (roughly 13% per year) when state planning was at its height. It dropped by half with the move towards independence in 1965. The drop was mostly in employment, while capital and productivity increased. This implies self-managed firms focused on increasing the wealth of their current employees rather than expanding the firm.
Yugoslavia was marked by large inefficiencies in the market. There were large wage differentials between firms after 1965, much larger than those found in a market economy. This is because there was no market wage, instead wages were based on the profitability of the firm and its number of members. Wages had less to do with supply and demand than with the degree of power each force contained in its bargaining and its connections. The economy lacked dynamism and innovation as entry of new firms was very limited to the point of non-existence. Only politicians could set up new firms and they focused instead on existing ones rather than on setting up new ones. There was a severe insider-outsider divide, as those who had jobs had an incentive to limit the number of employees in order to keep their income high. This made it difficult for new workers to break into the job market. This meant that while income grew impressively, the growth of employment was a lot less.
There is a lack of consensus over the level of investment in a self-managed firm. Some (like Saul Estrin) argue that there was a bias towards short term profits at the expense of long term investment. There was also a bias towards investments in areas that would affect them, as opposed to other enterprises or those in different parts of the country. Some (such as Duncan Wilson) argue that to the contrary, self-managed firms didn't spend all their income on wages but did invest as well. Mitja Kamusic seems to take both sides of the debate (or is at least claimed by both sides). All of which shows the problems of finding independent facts. It's worth noting that capitalism too gives an incentive towards short term profits. Most CEOs and managers make decisions that will not take full effect until after they move on and their predecessors take over and the financial crash is the most obvious example of short term profit leading to long term crisis. This bias towards the short term instead of the long term is also a problem with politics.
While Yugoslavia was less repressive than the Soviet Union, it was still a one party dictatorship. Many critics argue that the Communist Party still had large amount of control and self-management did not live up to its name. According to Broekmeyer: “in reality the power position of the individual worker has not changed all that much. The political party structures were, and still are, of paramount importance.” Yugoslavia suffered from the same problem that affected the Eastern Bloc, that of political interference and decisions being made not on their economic merit, but rather based on political connections. The party was willing to allow some, but not much independence from its line. In fact the self-management experiment was severely constrained after 1974 when the firms were getting too independent and the Party feared a threat to the power. This raises the question of how self-management would have turned out in a free and open society.
Workers themselves viewed self-management as more formal than realistic. They still perceived directors and managers as having control and workers being on the bottom. Broekmeyer argues that power structures did not change very much, with managers still running the company. Some viewed the workers council as mere window dressing to disguise the true source of power. Many noted the gap between the ideal and the reality. So while the Yugoslav Model sounded like a radical departure from the past, many contend that the Communist bureaucrats still maintained power (though less than in the rest of the Eastern Bloc).
One point that suggests that workers had less control than in theory was the prominence of strikes. If workers truly ran the company than surely there would be no strikes, as they would be striking against themselves. However strikes became a common phenomenon that undermines the rosy image painted. The strikes showed the limitation of workers power and their divide from mangers even in a self-management firm.
After 1974 the economic moved towards political and bureaucratic interference. The main effect of this new institutional framework was to replace competition with collusion throughout the system. Yugoslavia began to suffer the worst of capitalism and communism. The economy stagnated during the 1980s as the country was hit by a mixture of triple digit inflation, mass unemployment, emigration (over one million Yugoslavs left the country), a balance of payments deficit and rising national debt (at a time when interest rates skyrocketed). There was a lack of a capital market with decisions being taken politically rather than based on rates of return, leading to a misallocation of resources. Like in the Eastern Bloc, there was a lack of incentives and motivation. Over-egalitarianism lead to a lack of incentive for professionals, workers were guaranteed an income and a job while managers were not always judged based on performance. Layoffs were virtually unknown and bankruptcies were almost non-existent. There was price distortion due to reliance on government planning instead of the market. Regional disparities grew wider until they eventually split the country apart in mass ethnic bloodshed.
The model of self-management was a roaring success before crashing down. So what lessons can we draw from it? Even its critics recognise that it achieved some impressive results. Self-management involved the worker more in the running of the company. It greatly helped the industrialisation of the country, which happened quicker and smoother than elsewhere and without famine or upheaval. It increased motivation and creativity as well as energising the workforce. Studies from around the world show how co-operatives boost the productivity of their workforce. People like to be informed of decisions that will affect their working lives and how their superiors will be chosen. Self-management increased social mobility and gave ordinary workers a chance to take part in the running of a company, an opportunity they probably never would have otherwise had. It was summed up as “participation diminishes the meaninglessness of work, although it does not diminish the powerlessness of the worker.”
Many of the failings of Yugoslavia were the same failings of Communism. It is hard to have a creative, motivated and energised workforce when they know they are living in a Communist dictatorship. The economy was still planned to a large extent by the Communist Party who were prone to political intervention. It suffered from cronyism where getting resources was more dependent on who you knew rather than economic calculations. The lack of a market created all sorts of disincentives and inefficiencies. All of these raises the question of what would have happened if self-management had been introduced in a free society? What if it had been introduced to a wealthy, developed, open society with a market system, free from mass government and political intervention and without ethnic tensions?
It is hard to tell which problems and successes were caused by self-management and which happened despite it. Before drawing conclusions, it is worth thinking of the words of Marius Broekmeyer: “it is very dangerous to draw a lesson from the Yugoslav experience, fascinating though the experiment is to observe.”

Botanical Plant Stapelia
Stapelia is a low growing plant genus. It is spineless and found in Africa. The region of Africa in which it is more dominant is South Africa.
With spring in the air we bought some plants lately, including some succulents, and that brought my mind back to some of the plants I had in Europe but gave away when moving to Australia. This is a, presumably(Apocynaceae), in the Old Botanic Garden of G�ttingen, Germany, 2016. I had a plant of the same species but of course much smaller.Unfortunately they seem to be hard to get in Australia. The closest I saw were online stores that had them in the catalogue in theory but not actually in stock.What is so amazing about these cactus-like plants that are not cacti at all is, of course, their flower morphology, and that morphology is dictated by their pollination ecology. The flowers mimic rotting meat in colour, scent and sometimes even hairiness and are pollinated by confused carrion flies. Some people wonder why one would want to have a stinking flower, but I believe that is an indispensable part of its wonderful weirdness.
If you strip it down to its essence, the battle over SOPA/PIPA is Property vs. Freedom: the media companies want to defend their intellectual property, while Internet-users want to defend their freedom.
You won't often hear it characterized that way in the corporate media, though, because Property and Freedom are supposed to be inseparable, like Love and Marriage. Sing it, Frank:
This I tell you, brother:
You can't have one without the other.
Or, as Ron Paul more prosaically put it in 2004:
The rights of all private property owners … must be respected if we are to maintain a free society.
Simply saying the phrase “Property vs. Freedom” marks you as some kind of extreme Leftist. All right-thinking people know that Property can't possibly oppose Freedom.
Last summer I wrote Six True Things Politicians Can't Say. Well, here's another one: The relationship between Property and Freedom is highly contentious. (On second thought, the Love-and-Marriage parallel isn't that bad.)
Get off my lawn. Why is that relationship so contentious? It's simple: The essence of Property is the right to tell people to get off your lawn, and to sic the police on them if they don't. If you can't do that, it's not really your lawn.
So naturally Property increases Freedom for the owner. Once you have the right to sic the police on trespassers, your lawn becomes available for cookouts, gardening, minimally supervised children, and all sorts of other expressions of freedom.
But look at it from the other side. What if you're constantly being forced off other people's lawns and own no property you can retreat to? How free is that?
Free to be Jim Crow. Now read the Ron Paul quote in its full context. On the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Wikipedia entry, text of bill), which banned racial discrimination in “any place of public accommodation” (like the Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro) and in hiring, Paul portrayed the law in this light:
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 gave the federal government unprecedented power over the hiring, employee relations, and customer service practices of every business in the country. The result was a massive violation of the rights of private property and contract, which are the bedrocks of free society.
In other words, business owners lost some of their right to tell black people to get off their lawns. Definitely it was a diminishment of Property. But was Paul right that it was a net loss of Freedom, or did the freedom gained by blacks more than make up for the freedom lost by businesses?
Why is it your lawn anyway? Post-slavery America may look like an exceptional case, but actually it was just a particularly egregious example of a general rule: Never in the history of humankind has private property been fairly distributed. By the time American blacks stopped being property themselves, all the good stuff was already owned by whites.
Welcome to Freedom, suckers! Now get off my lawn.
One standard pro-property response to this point is that in a free economy property tends to move to the people who earn it through hard work and ingenuity, so mal-distributions even out over time. Maybe the newly-freed slaves did get a raw deal, but that was a long time ago. According to this point of view, by now their great-great-grandchildren must be pretty much where they deserve to be.
But far from an exception, the race problem is a convenient color-coding that makes the general historical pattern easier to see. Michael Hudson described that pattern like this:
The tendency for debts to grow faster than the population's ability to pay has been a basic constant throughout all recorded history. Debts mount up exponentially, absorbing the surplus and reducing much of the population to the equivalent of debt peonage.
In other words, the typical trend is not for things to even out after a few generations, but for unfair distributions of property to get moreso. Sing it, Billie:
Them that's got shall have.
Them that's not shall lose.
The only exception I can think of is post-World-War-II America and Europe, where property tended for decades to become more evenly distributed. But far from the natural workings of a free economy, that outcome required inheritance taxes, progressive income taxes, public education, laws to break up monopolies and protect unions, a significant social safety net, and many other government interventions.
Freedom and public property. America's two greatest symbols of freedom are the Cowboy and the Indian, both of whom own little, but live in a vast public common where they can hunt in the forests, drink in the streams, and swim in the lakes without worrying about ownership.
Contrast that freedom with economic blogger Noah Smith‘s account of downtown Tokyo.
there are relatively few free city parks. Many green spaces are private and gated off (admission is usually around $5). … outside your house or office, there is basically nowhere to sit down that will not cost you a little bit of money. Public buildings generally have no drinking fountains; you must buy or bring your own water. Free wireless? Good luck finding that! Does all this private property make me feel free? Absolutely not! Quite the opposite – the lack of a “commons” makes me feel constrained.
To me the lesson is clear: For all but the fabulously wealthy, freedom is maximized by balancing public and private property. It's nice to have your own lawn, but public property you can't be chased off of — roads, parks, sidewalks — is even more important. It's also nice to have public access to water and sanitation, and not to be at the proprietor's mercy whenever you enter a store, restaurant, or theater.
Intellectual property. Applying that logic to intellectual property gets you to the kind of public/private balance we used to have: Copyrights and patents grant creators and inventors valuable temporary rights, while producing a rich public common allowing fair use of recent creations. And since everything eventually becomes public, a balanced copyright law increases the value of the public domain by encouraging the creation of works that otherwise might be impractical.
Protests of SOPA and PIPA make no sense until you understand that we have lost that balance.
Consider how the music-downloading problem arose: By controlling distribution, media corporations inserted themselves as toll-collectors between creators and users. You'd pay $20 for a CD you could easily copy for $1, knowing that precious little of the difference made it back to the artist. Napster-users had few moral scruples against “stealing” music because the system was already amoral. (Call it the Leverage Principle: “The rich and powerful take what they want. We steal it back for you.”)
Also, endless copyrights have dammed the flow of material into the public domain. When Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse in 1928, they were granted a 28-year copyright with the prospect of renewing for another 28 years. Evidently, the prospect of Mickey entering the public domain in 1984 didn't deter Walt from creating him.
But every time that expiration date approaches, the Disney Corporation leans on Congress to extend the length of existing copyrights. Tom Bell illustrates how copyrights lengthen as Mickey ages.
Unless corporate money loses its primacy in our political system, nothing created after 1928 will ever enter the public domain. Unlike Mickey, the vast majority of that cultural treasure-trove will be orphan works that no one has the right to use. (For a book-length treatment of these issues, see The Public Domain, which the author has graciously put in the public domain.)
As Lawrence Lessig has pointed out, extending an existing copyright does nothing to promote creativity or otherwise advance the public interest:
No matter what the US Congress does with current law, George Gershwin is not going to produce anything more.
In short, the Infosphere is slouching towards Tokyo. Gradually the public common is shrinking towards the day when almost everything of value will be corporately owned.
SOPA/PIPA. The Stop Online Piracy Act in the House and the equivalent Protect Intellectual Property Act in the Senate are two more corporate attempts to buy laws that serve the private interest but not the public interest. (Interestingly, Politico covers the SOPA protests as a battle between Hollywood and Silicon Valley, as if the public were not involved.)
These laws would make search engines, internet-service providers, and other middlemen responsible for blocking access to web sites that copyright-holders claim are pirating their works. Since they bear no comparable responsibility for defending fair use, their safest course will be to block any site Disney or Time-Warner complains about.
Consider the quotes and images in this article. Traditionally, they would be considered fair use. But what if somebody complains? Is WordPress really going to pay a lawyer to read this article and write an opinion? Or are they just going to shut the Weekly Sift down?
The protests worked, for now. Websites like Wikipedia went dark on Wednesday to protest SOPA/PIPA, and a massive public response forced many lawmakers to change their positions.
But it's naive to think that's the end of the story. Corporate money is relentless. When public outrage dies down, we'll soon see the basic ideas of SOPA/PIPA back in some other form.
In addition to protests, we need a fundamental rethinking of intellectual property. As long as we're just talking about theft and how to prevent it, we're missing the point. The right question is how we restore the public/private balance to intellectual property.
We need intellectual property lines that are widely seen as legitimate. When we have that, the problems of trespassing and theft will become much, much smaller and easier to police.
Grades were the least of Faker's worries on their path to become a pro.
On July 5th (KST), OGN released the first part of RONALDO X FAKER 'THE PHENOM', a documentary that follows Faker and Ronaldo's path to become legends in their respective field. The first part of the documentary covered the two legends' humble beginning and their debut that shocked the world.
The documentary began with how football was everything for Ronaldo, and playing games was everything for Faker in their early years. Neither Faker nor Ronaldo were from a wealthy family, and trying to be a professional athlete was a challenge on not just their future but their day-to-day lives.
Faker specifically mentioned how trying to be a professional League player worried them and their family, but not because of the usual cliche of bad grades. "My family was not well off, but closer to being poor. To be frank, When I got serious at League, My family and I wasn't worried about my grades, but instead worried about the cost of electricity bill. I was scolded for it too."
At the end of their hardship, both Ronaldo and Faker had their breakthrough moment at the age of 17, when Ronaldo played for Brazil in 1994 FIFA World Cup and Faker won their first World Championship title as SKT's midlaner. For Faker, the moment when the crowd sang Happy Birthday to them at the All-Star Paris 2014 was especially unforgettable and a drive for them to try harder.
The Phenom will continue on July 8th and show how the two players had to endure and break through the slump to truly become the legends that they are now.
A new poll found public support for impeaching President Trump is higher today than it was for impeaching former President Richard Nixon in the summer of 1973, just as the Watergate scandal was beginning to unfold.
The survey from the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that 41 percent of Americans support impeaching Trump six months into their first term. Fifty-three percent are opposed to the president's impeachment.
A July 1973 poll from Gallup taken during Nixon's second term found that 24 percent of Americans supported Nixon's impeachment, and 62 percent were opposed.
"Even though Trump's approval rating is similar to Nixon's, more Americans support impeachment today than did in 1973," Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement. "That's partly due to the current hyper-partisanship that was simply not prevalent 40 years ago."
Two Democrats in Congress, Reps. Brad Sherman of California and Al Green of Texas, filed an article of impeachment against Trump last week.
The two lawmakers accused the president of obstructing justice by asking former FBI Director James Comey to curtail their investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and subsequently firing Comey.
Sherman and Green filed the article of impeachment after it was revealed that members of the Trump family and the campaign met with Russians in Trump Tower last year.
Donald Trump Jr., former campaign chairperson Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met with a Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, in June 2016 after Trump Jr. was promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.
Despite the recent revelations, the president's approval rating has remained steady, Monmouth's poll found.
Thirty-nine percent approve of the job Trump is doing in office — their approval rating was the same in May — and 52 percent disapprove.
The public generally disagrees, though, that Trump Jr.'s meeting at Trump Tower should've taken place.
Most Americans, 59 percent, said the meeting was inappropriate, and just 31 percent said it was appropriate, according to the Monmouth poll.
"Donald Trump's approval rating has basically held steady amid another round of supposedly damaging news," Murray said. "Most Americans disapprove of their son and other advisers meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 campaign, but that hasn't really moved the needle on any other public opinion metric related to the president."
Monmouth polled 800 adults in the United States from July 13 to July 16 with a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
See, I have this friend. For the last eight months or so, there's been a slow-motion car crash unfolding in their head, a mid-level disturbance in the limbic system, a real hardcore existential upheaval. I'm worried for him; it makes me sad to see the whole thing transpire. It started back in September; we had a flood in these parts, a once-in-a-generation, get-thee-to-the-ark kinda deal, and my friend's home heaved and sighed and leaked and broke and filled up with all manner of filth, and he— Well, they sort of snapped. Something inside their head switched off, or maybe on, or broke, or did something else nasty to their circuitry. I understand it, to a point; home is not a home when you don't feel safe in it. Or particularly happy.
Anyway, I think my friend walked the plank and sank into something deep and nasty. Started drinking a bit more than usual. Knew things weren't right, but seemed powerless to halt the regress. They didn't feel like doing much of anything. He's a poet, and he's written no poems in all this time. He's a reader, and has barely cracked a book. They binge on things that aren't good for them to binge on, and they know it. Still, they take it all in. Not much to do but sit and stare at walls or at the ceiling that leaked, or at the hands that betray them with their slothfulness. There's something in that head of theirs that needs to come out—he knows it. He's too tired or anesthetized to go looking for it.
Yes, they take it all in. They pointed me to the first track on the new record by the excellently named Trampled by Turtles, for example. The song is called “Midnight on the Interstate,” and they say they got it right, incontrovertibly right. Says they could have written it himself—all the details are down, are true. So I listened to the track; the first verse hits hard, but subtly:
Late night, midnight on the interstate
And I didn't feel so great
Until I saw the city
And I was younger, and open like a child
Man it's been a while
Since I felt that way
More and more I hesitate
‘Cause I don't know
There's a koan-like simplicity that masks a depth that hangs just beneath the surface of the song, of the words. It's apparent my friend gets it. They get the music, too—the fiddle and guitars and banjo, the tools of the bluegrass musician's trade. Trampled by Turtles has apparently been around for the better part of a decade; the band's previous record, Palomino, was on the bluegrass charts for over a year, and they've played on the biggest festival stages the U.S. has to offer. I don't listen to too much bluegrass, though (to my own detriment), so I was caught unawares.
Well, I'm aware now. Much of Stars and Satellites hews very close to the slow ‘n' tingly template established by “Midnight on the Interstate”—sort of like Springsteen's Nebraska, as played by the Avett Brothers or Bon-by-God-Iver. I don't know how well poignant, deliberately paced tracks like “Alone” or “Beautiful” will play at bluegrass festivals (unless they're played under a starless sky, with a very real threat of rain, in which case they'll be perfect), but when engaged in a darkened room, at night, when they provide the soundtrack to a thousand recriminations and best-forgotten memories, they are immensely effective.
The most desperate moment on the record falls to “Widower's Heart.” Woe be to the heartbroken, half-drunk listener who stumbles upon this one at the wrong/appropriate moment and hears the mournfulness drip from every corner of the song, every instrument, every word. Don't believe me? I give you the song's second verse:
I turned to say I'm sorry and I tried to explain
But the room it was empty and bitter and drained
No songs from the angels, no blood in my veins
Could ever replace you and here I remain
Where does anyone get off being that articulate about being that sad? And the sound that surrounds the voice singing those words so artfully complements the proceedings, it's impossible to imagine the sentiment being expressed in any other fashion.
It's not all gloom, though. Trampled by Turtles plays bluegrass, after all, so there are some up-tempo hoe-down tunes, just to make things interesting. The instrumentals “Risk” and “Don't Look Down,” in particular, give the band room to show off their considerable chops. Still, even the fast songs have a kind of slowness to them—a calmness in the midst of a whipping wind of stringed sound.
But I go back to my friend, and to “Midnight on the Interstate,” and I think about the last verse of the song:
Mostly sober
Sometimes I change my mind
And I don't have the time
No, we never do
I hear it and I understand my friend's helplessness, but I'm heartened by the last words the band sings before the extended coda:
Love and love and nothing else
It's all I need
I'm heartened because there's a recognition of the essential element in life—love, the one thing that keeps us moving forward, even when we cannot feel the progress ourselves. I hope my friend understands what the band apparently understands. I think they do.
President Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon is pushing for a tax increase on the very wealthiest Americans, an administration source confirmed to Fox News.
The source said Bannon wants "the top tax bracket to have a 4 in front of it."
The current top income tax bracket right now is taxed at 39.6 percent. The source said Bannon wants higher taxes on the wealthiest earners in order to give a bigger tax break for the middle class and investments.
Axios first reported on Bannon's push, noting the plan would run contrary to Republican orthodoxy but potentially represents the kind of populist philosophy on which Trump campaigned.
On the record, the White House pushed back on the Bannon report.
"The report is not an accurate representation of Steve's thinking,” Press Secretary Sean Spicer told Fox News.
But the administration source made clear Bannon is pushing for a change in the approach to tax reform.
The tax reform talks publicly have taken a backseat to Senate negotiations over a new health care overhaul – which are expected to extend through the July 4th recess.
Axios reported that economic adviser Gary Cohn and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are anxious to get a tax deal done and claimed Cohn has told associates that tax reform will never happen if officials don't hammer it out this year.
Well well well.......ain't that a weird abrupt halt to season 5.I mean damn.........now this completely changes my plans cause this means it's gonna be back to filly comics for a while.....with Wereluna and more DBZ pony pics again.I can't really complain because I got a lot to keep me busy and this season fueled so many more filly comics for me. Find the muffin.So yeah this was........ok come on I haven't done a Derpy/Spitfire comic since January.I still love how occasionally I get people ripping me on this series but in the end all that matters is I still have so much fun with these after 3+ years on this particular series. Oddly refreshing I put normal Derpy in this cause the last time I did one like this was back in S4 with the Equestria Games EP where I had Derpy use Spitfire to light the torch. Damn I love that comic.I will go back to the classic ones I love most....filly Derpy/Spitfire ones. Anyway this one....I mean this one totally explains itself. This was just too much fun to make and oddly these usually seem to be one of the better comics art wise. Been a rare season so far because I haven't made a lot of Derpy.....but expect that to change with filly comics back into the fray.So yeah guys....hope you liked these first have of seasonal comics.I will be doing the off-season schedule I guess like now till S5 comes back. Remember what it was? It was comic, DBZ pony, comic, DBZ pony....occasionally it may have a Wereluna thrown in or 2 comics in a row.We'll see what happen sooooo yeah......surprise guys....welcome to the mid-5 hiatus from Hasbro.

ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW: On the evening of February 11th 1964, following their concert at Washington Colisem, the Beatles made a brief appearance at the British Embassy reception in Washington D.C. After a short time of mingling with formally dressed dignitaries, things got out of hand as someone cut off a large lock of Ringo's hair as a souvenier. The wife of the British Embassador reportedly told the upset Beatles as they left the Embassy, "I really am terribly sorry about the scene in the ballroom." Ringo would later remember, "After they had a few drinks they got really silly and one guy decided he'd cut a lock of my hair off. I just started screaming at them and we didn't stay there long. These diplomats just don't know how to behave." In this very brief television interview, filmed at the British Embassy reception before the incident occured, John Lennon describes the excitement of the concert crowd at Washington Coliseum earlier in the evening.
- Jay Spangler, www.beatlesinterviews.org
Q: "Which one are you?" JOHN: "Eric." Q: (gesturing to the TV camera) "Eric, here is the American public..." JOHN: "I'm John." Q: "You're John?" JOHN: "Yeah, it was a joke." Q: "Well John, here is the American public. Forty million American viewers..." JOHN: "It just looks like one man to me. Oh. It's the camera man." Q: "What is your impression of the American public? You've been here for a while, now." JOHN: "They are the wildest." Q: "Why?" JOHN: "I don't know. Tonight was, you know, marvelous. Ridiculous. Almost eight-thousand people all shouting at once, and we were trying to shout louder than them with microphones, and we still couldn't beat 'em." Q: "Was America something like what you thought it would be like?" JOHN: "No, nothing like it. We thought it would be much quieter. We thought we'd, you know, have to grow on everybody, and everybody seems to sort of know us all, you know, as if we've been here for years. It's great." Q: "What is your impression of the new American singing group, 'The Cockroaches'? Have you heard them yet?" JOHN: "I haven't heard them. But it's already been done about eighty times in England. Sorry Cockroaches!" (grins and giggles)

UK police say they know who kidnapped British four-year-old Maddie McCann in Portugal seven years ago, and are angry and frustrated they cannot swoop in and arrest the men.
Three men who were members of a gang of thieves is now prime suspects in Maddie's abduction from a Portuguese beach resort in 2007.
Scotland Yard police officers have identified the men in the enduring mystery of the girl's disappearance.
British detectives have analysed mobile phone records of the men who are believed to be members of a burglary gang preying on tourists in the Algarve beach resort town of Praia da Luz around the time Madeleine vanished.
The police have tracked a high volume of calls between the three men in the hours after Madeleine was reported missing from the holiday apartment rented by their parents, Kate and Gerry McCann.
News_Image_File: Kate and Gerry McCann outside the hotel in Portugal where their 4-year-old daughter Maddie was abducted in 2007. Picture: AFP.
They are frustrated with the incompetence of the Portuguese investigation into the case, and with delays in pouncing on the suspects.
The UK police's leading scenario is the thieves broke into the apartment, disturbed the young girl and fled with them in what was a burglary gone wrong, rather than earlier speculation they were targeted by paedophiles or child abductors.
Mr and Mrs McCann, who had been dining with friends at a nearby location returned home to find their daughter had vanished.
Checks into the three men's criminal history and family backgrounds are believed to be made, but UK authorities are hamstrung by the fact they cannot make arrests in a foreign country, and none of the men are British.
News_Image_File: Photograph of missing Madeleine McCann taken during the holiday at Praia Da Luz, Portugal, from where they were kidnapped in 2007. Picture: AP.
Widespread criticism of the bungled Portuguese police investigation into the McCann case includes they gave little weight to the fact the McCann's holiday flat ad been broken into.
Scotland Yard believes the thieves accidentally woke Madeleine up, panicked and decided to take them with them when they fled the premises.
The burglars are now the focus of their inquiries, which has been thwarted by Portuguese authorities refusal to co-operate formally in a joint investigation.
UK detectives are said to be keen to arrest the men for questioning, but have to await diplomatic negotiations between the respective governments for permission to operate within Portugal.

They have also discounted a theory favoured by Portuguese police, that a 40-year-old former employee at the holiday complex where the McCanns stayed was Madeleine's kidnapper.
The man has since died in an accident.
The British detectives who have examined the records of mobile of thousands of people who were in Praia da Luz in May 2007 describe the phone analysis as "compelling".
In another development, Kate and Gerry McCann have been refused permission to give evidence at a defamation trial in Portugal over a book written by a former local police chief about the case.

Sometimes the clearest indicator of a family's dysfunction is, unfortunately, illness in its children. Like the proverbial canaries in the coal mine, it's the children who are most susceptible to the toxicity of family addiction and dysfunction. Hurt people, and literally scare the life out of little kids.
Fear – the kind of terror felt by children who live in toxic situations such as alcohol abuse, child abuse, family violence, the upheaval of divorce, concern about a parent's depression or mental illness – impacts a child for what may well be their or their abnormally short life.
The science to support my claim is documented in the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (ACE Study) – epidemiological research done by the Centers for Disease Control and Kaiser Permanente in San Diego. This study documents the undeniable link between toxic stress caused by experiences such as family addiction, abuse, dysfunction, violence, and divorce in childhood, and adult chronic diseases such as heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes, some breast cancers, and a host of autoimmune diseases. It also shows a strong link between the adverse experiences and depression, violence, being a victim of violence, and suicide.
I'll explore how these experiences manifest themselves as pulmonary distress – the kind of distress that leads to childhood asthma and continued pulmonary issues into adulthood. To do this, I invite you to join me in being a little kid again. In being a tiny person in a tiny body. Of being totally dependent on your mom or dad or grandparents. Of looking to them for food, shelter, clothing, nurture, love, joy.
Their joy is your joy. Their victories are your victories. If your mom is happy, everyone is happy. If your mom is miserable, chances are pretty good that everyone is miserable, especially you. Because if you're a little kid, you don't have the filters and distractions adults can use to deflect another person's dark behaviors.
Adults can seek and find ways to distract themselves from their pain: a glass of wine, a cigarette, a piece of cake, a pill, the “need” to work late. Or they can create their body's own drugs: the adrenaline rush from risky behaviors such as spending money they may or may not have, gossiping, becoming overly involved in the lives of others. Or the endorphin rush summoned up with sex, compulsive exercise, engaging in thrill sports, or a perfectionistic-driven cleaning binge. Or they can seek healthy solutions found in therapy, support groups, light-hearted team sports, a family outing or peaceful dinner, or prayer and meditation.
But you, a little kid, are simply stuck. Dependent, you must stew in the toxic brew of your family's addictions, mental illnesses, and never-ending chaos that you want to stop, but cannot. You sit in terror, taking shallow breaths through sleepless nights as the same behaviors are repeated. And repeated.
And so your frustration is not unlike the frustration a chained puppy feels as it sits in the hot sun, no water, no relief, no protection, pulling against the chain again and again, fearful and vulnerable when bigger dogs circle the yard to attack. Like that puppy, you are trapped, afraid, panting. Like that puppy's body, your body generates all manner of stress hormones that do not go away the minute you find comfort, or even days – or years – after you've reached adulthood.
As Dr. Peter Gergen, a senior medical officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was quoted in an article on WebMD.com:
“Scientists have documented a range of stressful events that have been associated with asthma symptoms. These include school exams, public speaking, family conflict, public disasters, and exposure to violence. Stress may directly affect the body or cause people to manage their asthma less effectively.” Gergen continues: “First, stress and anxiety can cause physiological changes that may provoke an attack. These strong emotions trigger the release of chemicals, such as histamine and leukotrienes, which can trigger the narrowing of your airway.” Gergen adds that stress can also cause people to forget their medication while at the same time stress-related hormones reduce the body's ability to fight off colds and other respiratory infections. “Viral infections are very important causes for triggering asthma,” they say.
So as a defenseless child, your toxic stew of stress hormones bubbles up when there's fear, and seeps into your cells, weakening them. Your body is torn down at the same time it is trying to grow, and at the same time your little spirit is trying to trust and love and be childlike. Your lungs need to expand. You need to be able to take deep breaths to oxygenate your blood and feed your brain and organs. But fear – the fear you feel when your mother drinks, or when your dad is depressed or when your teenage sister cuts themselves – keeps you trapped like that puppy on a short chain. In “fight or flight” mode, adrenaline constricts blood vessels; breathing is shallow. You hurt in your heart and you don't know how to stop it.
Maybe the swelling in your airways would have happened even if you'd been born into a family without traumatic stress. Maybe. Or maybe, like the thousands of middle-class Americans in the CDC's ACE Study, if you are growing up in a family where there is addiction, abuse, divorce, caustic criticism, and violence, you are among the 28 million adult children of alcoholics terrified and stricken by toxic stress. If that is the case, you are, according to the study, almost four times more likely to have chronic pulmonary disease.
As Dr. Vincent J. Felitti, one of the co-founders of the ACE Study, writes in The Relationship of Adverse Childhood Experiences to Adult Health: Turning gold into lead:
The ACE study reveals a powerful relationship between our emotional experiences as children and our physical and mental health as adults, as well as the major causes of adult mortality in the United States. It documents the conversion of traumatic emotional experiences in childhood into organic disease later in life. How does this happen, this reverse alchemy, turning the gold of a newborn infant into the lead of a depressed, diseased adult? The study makes it clear that time does not heal some of the adverse experiences we found so common in the childhoods of a large population of middle-aged, middle-class Americans. One does not `just get over' some things, not even fifty years later. Clearly, we have shown that adverse childhood experiences are common, destructive, and have an effect that often lasts for a lifetime. They are the most important determinant of the health and well-being of our nation. Unfortunately, these problems are painful to recognize and difficult to deal with. Most physicians would far rather deal with traditional organic disease. Certainly, it is easier to do so, but that approach also leads to troubling treatment failures and the frustration of expensive diagnostic quandaries where everything is ruled out but nothing is ruled in.
My interpretation of what Felitti has written? It is far easier to treat the symptom – be it asthma, a stomach ache, a backache – than it is to address and heal the root cause. And a root cause of asthma could be whatever it is that's going on at home that's evoking the anxiety that triggers the illness.
Again, I know adverse childhood experiences are not the cause of ALL asthma and childhood illness. Nevertheless, as an advocate for children of alcoholics, and as an adult child of an alcoholic myself, I must raise the question: What if pediatricians would ask about what's going on at home? What if they would recommend a course of action that would help the parents create a home life with more joy and less terror? What if their prescription pad said: “Mom: 90 AA meetings in 90 days. Dad: Cut up the credit cards, quit spending, and catch fireflies with this child for 30 minutes each night for the next three months. Grandma: Take an anger management class MWF and a yoga class on alternate days”?
Perhaps then caring for these heart-sick children – these innocents trapped and vulnerable in their own families – would lead to a society that works to reduce the toxic stew drains, strains, and causes the death of childhood when children are supposed to be children, and the early death of so many still-terrified adults.

Hey guys its! [insert cheesy music here] Dev Diary time!
This time with the 4th installment of the Wild Season DevDiary we have some exciting stuff to review! So lets get right into it!
With Christmas & New Years around the corner this is the second to last build we will be distributing! (The last build of the year will come just before Christmas! And will be the last Alpha Build before we officially Enter Beta (tan tan taaaan!)
The sprint officially ended on Friday 5th of December with the following accomplishments!
Keyboard rebinding! (Remap your keyboard to controls you want!)
First iteration of the Mini map! (still a little buggy and no global map yet though)
Buff / Debuff System
Added a bunch of character schedules (not live yet)
Ability to buy key animal types (chicken, sheep, cow, Horse, Dog). Once the mechanics are polished we will add more types & variations.
Ability to harvest from animals with tools (milker for cows, shear for sheep)
ability to speak or “handle” the animal with care
ability to push animals
ability to pick up chickens
Turned on Farm area debris generator
Did some work on the mine
Visual Improvements throughout the town
Improved Saving
On that note, this sprint we're planning to work on the following:
Improve the mini-map /work on the global map
Adjustments to buff/debuff
fix animal bugs found in last sprint
Weather system for storms
Polish the story-telling tools so our writing & game-design team can implement more story content during the beta (including re-doing the intro sequence based on your feedback!)
As usual! The team has been hard at work bringing Wild Season to life!
With so many things going on! This week we've decided to skip the feature focus and show you a little bit more in detail about what we've accomplished as its very visual!
So lets start with the Minimap:
As you can see here on the screenshot, all screens will have this little map at the bottom to help you navigate the screen you're in. We're also working on a global map to tell you where you are compared to the world! This should help all those alpha testers that kept getting lost in the alpha testing! It's still a little buggy though! As some alignment and sizing issues need to be ironed out, but for the most part its there! (I just found a major issue in the mac version so screenshots will be a little sparse)
Animals
We also did some work on the animals, polished them up, got the mechanics working. You can now buy, and care for animals!
For those tho missed it, this was our #screenshotsaturday pic we released on Twitter and facebook. As you can see we still have a few things to tweak (moonwalking cows, animal limits, and 2D turning). But you can buy, pet, talk, brush, and extract produce from them! (once we're in Beta, we'll also be looking at adding more varieties and animal skins (beta & alpha testers we're lookin at you for ideas!)
Buff/Debuff
So I discussed this in the last Dev Diary:
As you guys can see, we added a little section next to your avatar head to showoff what statuses are currently affecting you (in this case, you're sick, starving and drunk…well done!). Each adding its own multiplier effect to stamina and/or exp gains.
Aside from that we did some other world and back end work
Control Remapping
Its here! Remap the controls to a way that's comfortable to you! Alpha backers! We're looking for feedback on this! Please also send us screenshots of your configurations, so we can opt for the best setup out of the box, to reduce fiddling when the commercial version comes out!
Mining
We previously showed you some of the ores in mining (with lots of educational feedback!). so here's a little more work from the mines, including a level map, and some animations. Our mining format will change slightly, in that you wont be digging around looking for stairs. Rather you will need to work your way town the screen to the stairs to the next level, as the mine has existed for a long time, but “rocks and debris regularly fall”, blocking your way deeper into the mine.
Graphics
Finally here is a small selection from the graphics we finished this week! Including an inventory icon for the clownfish (aka Nemo!), and some status icons for the animals
Working Things Pending List:
Finishing Mining
Fishing
Quest log/notebook
Relationship Engine
Story Engine (& story encoding)
Property Upgrades
Animal Breeding
Marriage
Kids
Helpers
Lots and Lots of polish!
Thats it for this week!
If you haven't done so, remember you can still pre-order Wild Season at http://www.wildseasonthegame.com. We're currently offering early access beta and 10% off on pre-orders!

A socialist Brexit to reshape UK and Europe
Jeremy Corbyn (bottom right) addresses supporters at a campaign visit in early June this year. Corbyn sees Brexit as an opportunity to strengthen the role of the state in economic life | Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images
The morning after the general election, the British woke up in a different world. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's brand of recycled socialism was not so unelectable after all; young voters had become an electoral force; and Theresa May's Conservatives looked hapless and exhausted.
But a major question mark still hangs over Brexit — and more specifically, what the Labour Party's electoral gains will mean for Britain's exit from the bloc.
The fundamental debate is no longer a fight between those who oppose Britain leaving the bloc and those who want to rip off the band-aid. The tension lies in different visions of where the country is headed.
In the wake of the June 8 election, the issue now is what to do with Brexit; what kind of society to build using the degrees of freedom that the separation will create. And while May spends time defending Brexit against its opponents, Corbyn is looking further ahead — opposing their brand of Brexit in the name of a more social, more revolutionary version.
May has outlined the vision of a U.K. more free to profit from the global economy and more closely aligned with Donald Trump's United States in reducing the role of international regulations. Corbyn, meanwhile, sees Brexit as an opportunity to strengthen the role of the state in economic life. The Labour Party wants the state to be the main agent in job creation and the official guardian of families and communities against the winds of global economic forces.
If Corbyn were to take over as prime minister, Brexit could become the vehicle for a movement of socialist renewal.
Corbyn understood this better than anyone else. The Brexit referendum — prompted and promoted by others — left Corbyn with the space they needed to promote a socialist renewal. They drew a sharp distinction between a race-to-the-bottom Brexit and a jobs-first Brexit.
It's hardly surprising that the Labour Party made a point of embracing Brexit. After all, so much of its manifesto is in direct violation of European Union law. Corbyn has vouched to regain control over energy supply networks, discriminate against companies that don't recognize trade unions, and actively support struggling industries through state aid — ideas the European Commission and the European Court of Justice would find very difficult to accept. Only by leaving the EU can the party hope to implement its pledges.
In Brussels, people are wary. Frankly, everything was going well enough. European institutions and member countries were happy with the way Brexit negotiations had been shaping up. They could hardly have asked for a better opponent than a coterie of Conservatives trapped — fairly or unfairly — in the political maze of imperial nostalgia.
Now, they're not so sure. If Corbyn were to take over as prime minister, Brexit could become the vehicle for a movement of socialist renewal — something that might capture the imaginations of southern Europeans, who have longed for exactly that for years.
These past weeks there have been whispers in Spain and France that perhaps the reason Corbyn is prospering while French and Spanish socialist parties risk extinction is that he, unlike them, is soon to be free of EU shackles.
Forget hard or soft Brexit — it's really about whether Britain goes left or right after Brexit.
The distinction between a hard and soft Brexit was always deeply flawed. In the end, a hard Brexit is the only thing that makes sense. The only way the high costs of leaving Europe can be justified is by aggressively pursuing all potential advantages in the areas of regulation and trade. And these advantages cannot be pursued if the U.K. stays in the single market or the customs union for any amount of time.
But it would be a mistake to start off with a hard Brexit — for the simple fact that its advantages are not yet ready for the taking.
Why should the U.K. want to leave the single market in the first five years after exiting the EU, while London still contributes to the EU budget and has not yet developed its own thoughts on how to regulate its economy?
And why should it leave the customs union now, given that it is extremely unlikely it will be able to negotiate its own terms of trade with third states in the next decade or two?
With any luck, in this new political environment, government and opposition will be able to reach a wide agreement on the terms of its exit: soft at first, progressively harder than time passes.
That, of course, is only the technical part. The politics of Brexit are only just getting started and divisions will deepen. The battle between a liberal and a socialist Brexit will shape British and European politics for decades to come.

Since President Trump's September decision to end DACA, Hollywood actor Bambadjan Bamba has been preparing for their coming out.
The “Black Panther” actor had not publicly revealed their immigration status, but Tuesday they took the bold step of joining a campaign to legalize immigrants like him, becoming the public face of DACA recipients working in Hollywood. Known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program granted temporary resident status to an estimated 800,000 immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.
“We know the industry is run by a lot of immigrants,” Bamba tells Variety. “There are immigrant actors,” they said, adding that “Hollywood can play a big part in at least changing policy so that it can be easier for actors to work in Hollywood.”
Bamba, 35, has managed to work for a decade in Hollywood, thanks in part to a work permit secured through DACA.  They are currently has a recurring role on NBC's “The Good Place” and will play a military leader in the upcoming Marvel film, “Black Panther,” directed by Ryan Coogler.
“I'm going public first and foremost because I'm sick and tired of living in fear and hiding about this issue,” they said. “I've kind of been in this status for 25 years of my life. I remember when the administration decided to cancel DACA — that was the last straw for me because not only am I married, but I have a daughter now. I didn't feel like I could still sit back and keep hitting the snooze button.”

Bamba was just 10 years old when, fleeing persecution, they came to the U.S. with their parents from the West African country of the Ivory Coast. They grew up in the south Bronx, developing their English-speaking skills by listening to hip-hop artists like Snoop Dogg and Mase.
It wasn't until they began applying for colleges that they learned the legal realities of their immigration status, which made them ineligible for financial aid. They worked as a cab driver to help pay for drama school.
By coming out now to share their story, Bamba said they hope theirs and the efforts of others can convince Congress to pass a bill that would legalize Dreamers, immigrants brought into the country as children.  They are issuing a challenge to the entertainment industry to lend its support to the cause, particularly after a largely muted response to Trump's decision to rescind the immigration program.
“Because Hollywood is so powerful and can change culture, I hope that they would stand with me not just on social media but take concrete actions,” they said.
No official tally of how many Dreamers work in the entertainment business exists. But analysts project the number is high, considering Hollywood is one of the region's biggest employers. The California Employment Development Dept. estimates there are 140,000 people in the entertainment industry, which pumps billions into the Los Angeles economy.
Bamba said they want to see entertainment companies be more proactive in protecting vulnerable employees, pointing out the efforts by tech industry leaders who have pledged to pay immigration lawyers' fees for affected employees. They have also pledged to lobby Congress to find a permanent solution.  They are asking people to sign their petition asking Hollywood to stand with immigrants.
“My goal is to get a clean Dream Act passed,” Bamba said. “That's what we are all fighting for right now.”

SEATTLE - A Connecticut business person accused of refusing to pay golfers who won prizes for making holes in one has been extradited to Washington state.
Kevin Kolenda, 55, of Norwalk, Conn., has been booked into the King County Jail. They were flown to Seattle from Connecticut under guard Thursday, according to a release issued Friday by the Washington state insurance commissioner.
Kolenda specializes in insuring golf tournament hole-in-one prizes, and similar allegations have been made against Kolenda or their business in numerous other states, including Montana, Ohio, Georgia, California, New York, Hawaii, Alabama, Massachusetts, Florida, Connecticut and North Carolina.
Police charging documents from Washington accuse Kolenda of failing to pay prize money when several Seattle-area golfers connected on elusive aces.
Prosecutors say Kolenda offered to insure prizes as large as $50,000 for a fraction of the cost, but ended up refusing to pay winners or dragging their feet at returning deposits.
"Over and over again, Mr. Kolenda has taken in insurance money and promised to pay, and then what we've heard complaints about over and over again, is that they do not pay," said Rich Roesler, a spokesperson for Washington state insurance commissioner's office. "We've seen charities dip into their own pockets to make up these payments."
Connecticut officials fined Kolenda $5.9 million in 2009 for illegally offering insurance without a license. They face similar charges in Montana.
Kolenda is expected to be arraigned Monday at King County Superior Court in Seattle.
CLEVELAND — Avik Roy is a Republican's Republican. A health care wonk and editor at Forbes, they have worked for three Republican presidential hopefuls — Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio. Much of their adult life has been dedicated to advancing the Republican Party and conservative ideals.
But when I caught up with Roy at a bar just outside the Republican convention, they said something I've never heard from an establishment conservative before: The Grand Old Party is going to die.
“I don't think the Republican Party and the conservative movement are capable of reforming themselves in an incremental and gradual way,” they said. “There's going to be a disruption.”
Roy isn't happy about this: They believe it means the Democrats will dominate national American politics for some time. But they also believe the Republican Party has lost its right to govern, because it is driven by white nationalism rather than a true commitment to equality for all Americans.
“Until the conservative movement can stand up and live by that principle, it will not have the moral authority to lead the country,” they told me.
This is a standard assessment among liberals, but it is frankly shocking to hear from a prominent conservative thinker. Our conversation had the air of a confessional: of Roy admitting that they and their intellectual comrades had gone wrong, had failed, had sinned.
Their history of conservatism was a Greek tragedy. It begins with a fatal error in 1964, survived on the willful self-delusion of people like Roy himself, and ended with Donald Trump.
“I think the conservative movement is fundamentally broken,” Roy tells me. “Trump is not a random act. This election is not a random act.”
The conservative movement's founding error: Barry Goldwater
(William Lovelace/Daily Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Barry Goldwater.
The conservative movement has something of a founding myth — Roy calls it an “origin story.”
In 1955, William F. Buckley created the intellectual architecture of modern conservatism by founding National Review, focusing on a free market, social conservatism, and a muscular foreign policy. Buckley's ideals found purchase in the Republican Party in 1964, with the nomination of Barry Goldwater. While Goldwater lost the 1964 general election, their ideas eventually won out in the GOP, culminating in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.
Normally, Goldwater's defeat is spun as a story of triumph: how the conservative movement eventually righted the ship of an unprincipled GOP. But according to Roy, it's the first act of a tragedy.
“Goldwater's nomination in 1964 was a historical disaster for the conservative movement,” Roy tells me, “because for the ensuing decades, it identified Democrats as the party of civil rights and Republicans as the party opposed to civil rights.”
“The gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism”
Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They themselves was not especially racist — they believed it was wrong, on free market grounds, for the federal government to force private businesses to desegregate. But this “principled” stance identified the GOP with the pro-segregation camp in everyone's eyes, while the Democrats under Lyndon Johnson became the champions of anti-racism.
This had a double effect, Roy says. First, it forced black voters out of the GOP. Second, it invited in white racists who had previously been Democrats. Even though many Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act in Congress, the post-Goldwater party became the party of aggrieved whites.
“The fact is, today, the Republican coalition has inherited the people who opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — the Southern Democrats who are now Republicans,” Roy says. “Conservatives and Republicans have not come to terms with that problem.”
Conservative intellectuals were blind to the truth about the GOP — hence Trump

The available evidence compiled by historians and political scientists suggests that 1964 really was a pivotal political moment, in exactly the way Roy describes.
Yet Republican intellectuals have long denied this, fabricating a revisionist history in which Republicans were and always have been the party of civil rights. In 2012, National Review ran a lengthy cover story arguing that the standard history recounted by Roy was “popular but indefensible.”
This revisionism, according to Roy, points to a much bigger conservative delusion: They cannot admit that their party's voters are motivated far more by white identity politics than by conservative ideals.
“Conservative intellectuals, and conservative politicians, have been in kind of bubble,” Roy says. “We've had this view that the voters were with us on conservatism — philosophical, economic conservatism. In reality, the gravitational center of the Republican Party is white nationalism.”
Conservative intellectuals, for the most part, are horrified by racism. When they talk about believing in individual rights and equality, they really mean it. Because the Republican Party is the vehicle through which their ideas can be implemented, they need to believe that the party isn't racist.
So they deny the party's racist history, that its post-1964 success was a direct result of attracting whites disillusioned by the Democrats' embrace of civil rights. And they deny that to this day, Republican voters are driven more by white resentment than by a principled commitment to the free market and individual liberty.
“It's the power of wishful thinking. None of us want to accept that opposition to civil rights is the legacy that we've inherited,” Roy says.
They expand on this idea: “It's a common observation on the left, but it's an observation that a lot of us on the right genuinely believed wasn't true — which is that conservatism has become, and has been for some time, much more about white identity politics than it has been about conservative political philosophy. I think today, even now, a lot of conservatives have not come to terms with that problem.”
This, Roy believes, is where the conservative intellectual class went astray. By refusing to admit the truth about their own party, they were powerless to stop the forces that led to Donald Trump's rise. They told themselves, over and over again, that Goldwater's victory was a triumph.
But in reality, it created the conditions under which Trump could thrive. Trump's politics of aggrieved white nationalism — labeling black people criminals, Latinos rapists, and Muslims terrorists — succeeded because the party's voting base was made up of the people who once opposed civil rights.
“[Trump] tapped into something that was latent in the Republican Party and conservative movement — but a lot of people in the conservative movement didn't notice,” Roy concludes, glumly.
For conservatism to live, the conservative movement has to die
(Bill Clark/CQ Roll Cal) A sign with one of the RNC's most popular slogans.
Over beers, I ask Roy how they feel about all of this personally. Their answer is very sad.
“When Marco [Rubio] lost, I went through the five stages of grief. It was tough. I had to spend some time thinking about what to do for the next several years of my life,” they say.
“I left a comforting and rewarding career as a biotech investor to do this kind of work. I did it because I felt it was important, and I care about the country. Maybe it's cheesy to say that, but I really sincerely do,” they continue. “So then, okay, what do I do? Do I do the same things I've been doing for the last four years? To me, just to do that to collect a paycheck didn't make a lot of sense.”
This soul-searching led Roy to an uncomfortable conclusion: The Republican Party, and the conservative movement that propped it up, is doomed.
Both are too wedded to the politics of white nationalism to change how they act, but that just isn't a winning formula in a nation that's increasingly black and brown. Either the Republican Party will eat itself or a new party will rise and overtake its voting share.
“Either the disruption will come from the Republican Party representing cranky old white people and a new right-of-center party emerging in its place, or a third party will emerge, à la the Republicans emerging from the Whigs in the [1850s],” Roy says.
The work of conservative intellectuals today, they argue, is to devise a new conservatism — a political vision that adheres to limited government principles but genuinely appeals to a more diverse America.
“I think it's incredibly important to take stock,” they say, “and build a new conservative movement that is genuinely about individual liberty.”
I don't know how this would work. I don't think Roy knows either.
For the entire history of modern conservatism, its ideals have been wedded to and marred by white supremacism. That's Roy's own diagnosis, and I think it's correct. As a result, we have literally no experience in America of a politically viable conservative movement unmoored from white supremacy.
I've read dozens of conservative intellectuals writing compellingly about non-racist conservative ideals. Writers like Andrew Sullivan, Ross Douthat, Reihan Salam, Michael Brendan Dougherty, and too many others to count have put forward visions of a conservative party quite different from the one we have.
But not one of these writers, smart as they are, has been able to explain what actual political constituency could bring about this pure conservatism in practice. The fact is that limited government conservatism is not especially appealing to nonwhite Americans, whereas liberalism and social democracy are. The only ones for whom conservatism is a natural fit are Roy's “cranky old white people” — and they're dying off.
Maybe Roy and company will be able to solve this problem. I hope they do. America needs a viable, intellectually serious right-of-center party.
Because we now know what the alternative looks like. It's Donald Trump.

Researchers have engineered stem cells to mimic some characteristics of cancer that when injected trick the body into building up a natural immunity to the disease.
The work focuses on colon cancer but the scientists believe it could be widened to provide a "universal cancer vaccine".
The novel approach by scientists in America and China is based on the principle that stem cells and cancer cells share many characteristics.
The theory is similar to a normal vaccine which mimics the disease it is vaccinating against and so builds up natural immunity.
Then when the patient is exposed to, or in danger of developing, the actual disease the body is ready to fight back.
Dr Zihai Li, of the University of Connecticut Stem Cell Institute, said the findings opened up a whole new model approach to cancer research.
"Cancer and stem cells share many molecular and biological features", they said.
"By immunising the host with stem cells, we are able to fool the immune system to believe that cancer cells are present and thus to initiate a tumour-combating immune programme.
The immunologist's colleague Dr Bei Liu, added: "Although we have only tested the protection against colon cancer, we believe that stem cells might be useful for generating an immune response against a broad-spectrum of cancers, thus serving as a universal cancer vaccine."
The latest research is the first to use human stem cells to vaccinate against cancer.
The team witnessed a 'dramatic' decline in tumour growth within the immunised mice.
The findings published in the journal Stem Cell, come just two months after scientists found a link between bacteria and many cases of colon cancer.
The breakthrough also pointed the way to vaccines or drugs to fight the disease, one of the most common forms of cancer in Britain. More than 37,000 people are diagnosed with colon cancer every year in Britain
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore believed that they have uncovered how the bacteria could be a trigger for cancer.
Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's science information manager, said: "This is an interesting study and suggests a new approach to cancer vaccines – however scientists will need to test these ideas in clinical studies before we know if this approach can be used to treat cancer patients."
Greg Kloehn has the eyes of an artist, the hands of a contractor, and a mind to blend the two in the most interesting, and compassionate of ways. (Published Monday, Jan. 12, 2015)
(This story originally published April 2, 2014)
Greg Kloehn wonders why it didn't dawn on them sooner.
The West Oakland artist had long been fascinated by the temporary shelters their homeless neighbors created for themselves out of materials they scavenged from the street.
So fascinated, in fact, a couple of years ago, Greg decided to give one a try. “I wanted to build a home in a day, for no money.”
One week (and $50) later, they had one: a tiny home on wheels, long enough to lie down in, not tall enough to stand in, roughly the size of a compact car.
The first small home Greg built sat in their studio for months before they gave it to a homeless woman.
And that was that.
Greg had no plans for what to do with it once completed, so the home simply sat in their studio for months.
Then, one rainy night, Charlene, a homeless woman in Greg's neighborhood, knocked on their door.
WATCH MORE BAY AREA PROUD STORIES
“She asked if I had a tarp,” Greg recalls. “I told her, no, I didn't.”
As Greg walked back into their studio, though, they glanced at the home, “and I thought, What am I doing with this? So I ran back outside, and said, ‘Charlene, come back tomorrow and I'll have a home for you.'”
The next day Charlene did return. Greg wheeled the home out to the street, handed them a bottle of champagne and keys to the refrigerator door that was the home's front entrance.
Each morning Greg sifts through the piles of illegally dumped trash in their neighborhood looking for building materials.
“As soon as I gave it away,” Greg says, “it felt so good. Why didn't I think of this sooner?”
While they may have been late to the idea, Greg is now making up for lost time. Each morning, with a cup of coffee in one hand and their van's steering wheel in the other, Greg scours the streets around their home and studio looking for the piles of illegally dumped trash that show up every night.
From the piles they take anything that might help them build a home: pallets, 2x4s, refrigerator doors and shelving, and paint.
A team of volunteers helps Greg mold those pieces into tiny, moveable structures.
Greg, with the help of volunteers, has now built, and given away, more than a dozen small homes on wheels.
Since their first home give-away, Greg has built more than a dozen small homes on wheels and gifted them to the area's homeless.
“Everyone's really happy,” Greg says about the donations, “lots of hugs, lots of happiness. That's the best part for me.”
With the exception of some nails and screws, the homes are built entirely from materials that Greg has found on the streets.
Greg does not claim that their homes are the answer to the problem of homelessness, they are simply a way for one man to do something nice for a person in need of a little help.
“It's funny,” Greg says, “they may be homeless, but they are my neighbors.”
Greg recently delivered a home to a homeless neighbor, Kelly, who has been living on the streets for 19 years.
Replete with tradition, the Hastings congress was held for the 92nd time this week. It has been staged every year bar war years since 1920, at a historic venue where 10 world champions have played. The event's peak years are long past but it has gained a new lease of life as the backing of Tradewise Insurance has augmented funds from its loyal borough council. Hastings 2016-17, which ended on Thursday, produced an exceptional individual result.
Hastings has always been a proving ground for young talent and this year it was Ramesh Praggnanandhaa, at 11 the youngest ever international master, who claimed attention. Their games were featured daily on the congress website, which was transformed and upgraded from previous years, and it made online viewing a pleasure.
The Indian prodigy occasionally rode their luck at Hastings, but they remained unbeaten, recovered strongly to win from a dubious position in the final round, scored 6½/9 and finished with joint second prize, just half a point behind their countryman Deep Sengupta. It was their best performance yet and showed clear grandmaster potential.
They still have 14 months remaining to break Sergey Karjakin's world record as the youngest ever GM at 12 years, seven months, but they have a rival.
Nodirbek Abdusattorov, from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, beat two GMs in a tournament when aged only nine. Last October, at 11 years 10 months, they scored the youngest ever GM result in stunning style at St Petersburg, where they totalled 7/9 including 4/6 against GMs. Their victims included the Dutch GM Benjamin Bok, winner of the 2015 London Classic Open, and Brazil's No1 GM, Alexander Fier, who competed at Hastings this week.
You would expect Uzbek officials to have made every effort to place their gifted young player at London Olympia, Hastings or Stockholm in December, the month of their 12th birthday, to give them the best chances for their required second and third GM norms, reach a 2500 rating and so win the race with their Indian rival to break Karjakin's coveted record. Not a bit of it. Instead they were bizarrely diverted to the world schools under-13 at Sochi, where they duly cleaned up in the East European and Asian field with 8/9.
Time is running out for the Uzbek schoolboy. Their IM title, though earned, is not yet ratified and their Fide rating of 2429 is still well short of the GM requirement of 2500.  They are not entered for Tradewise Gibraltar, the world's best open, which starts on 17 January, and it is unclear whether they will play in the next big event at Moscow Aeroflot in February.
The startling success of the two sub-teens incidentally highlights the growing importance of the world under-eight championship as a seedbed for major talents. Abdusattorov won it in 2012 and Praggnanandhaa in 2013, following on from America's Awonder Liang who was the 2011 under-eight champion and went on to score their first GM norm last summer when barely 13.
Sergey Karjakin's victory, on tie-break from Magnus Carlsen, at the world blitz in Doha was helped by this speedy win over the Ukrainian who had won the world rapid crown. The opening, a Sicilian Defence Richter Attack, is significant since Karjakin also used it in another decisive game, against Fabiano Caruana in the final round of the 2016 candidates. The result here is effectively settled in a single move when Ivanchuk errs with 14....c5? (f6!) after which the sacrifice 15 Bxh6! quickly leads to a winning attack.

How many people does it take to change this light bulb? None.
On June 18, the oldest-known working light bulb in the world will celebrate the 110th year it has burned bright. The bulb, which hangs idly about in a fire station in Livermore, California, holds the Guinness World Record.
(LIST: The Making of Thomas Edison)
However, it's not clear how this particular bulb has been glowing since it was installed in 1901. Lynn Owens, who is in charge of the light bulb centennial committee, says, “Nobody knows how it's possible. It is a 60-watt bulb and it's only turned on for about four watts, but nobody knows why it keeps burning… We've had scientists from all over the country look at this light bulb.”
Not that the bulb's shiny record is perfect. It has endured some initial glitches in 1901, a fraught week in 1937 and some random power outages all the way up to 1970s. Originally donated to the fire station, the bulb was actually designed by Adolphe Chaillet, who – get this – originally competed with Thomas Edison to make the best light bulb in town.
Now I'm not sure if Edison would be proud or rolling in their grave, but one thing's for sure: let's hope no one hits the power switch on the way out of the door on this bulb.

River falls short of Nebraska nuke plant shutdown
OMAHA, Neb.  The bloated Missouri River rose to within 18 inches of forcing the shutdown of a nuclear power plant in southeast Nebraska but stopped and ebbed slightly Monday, after several levees in northern Missouri failed to hold back the surging waterway.
The river has to hit 902 feet above sea level at Brownville before officials will shut down the Cooper Nuclear Plant, which sits at 903 feet, Nebraska Public Power District spokesperson Mark Becker said.
Flooding is a concern all along the river because of the massive amounts of water that the Army Corps of Engineers has released from six dams. Any significant rain could worsen the flooding especially if it falls in Nebraska, Iowa or Missouri, which are downstream of the dams.
The river is expected to rise as much as 5 to 7 feet above flood stage in much of Nebraska and Iowa and as much as 10 feet over flood stage in parts of Missouri. The corps predicts the river will remain that high until at least August.
Becker said the river rose to 900.56 feet at Brownville on Sunday, then dropped to 900.4 feet later in the day and remained at that level Monday morning. The National Weather Service said the Missouri River set a new record Sunday at Brownville when its depth was measured at 44.4 feet. That topped the record of 44.3 feet set during the 1993 flooding.
The Cooper Nuclear Plant is operating at full capacity Monday, Becker said.
The Columbus-based utility sent a "notification of unusual event" to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission when the river rose to 899 feet early Sunday morning. The declaration is the least serious of four emergency notifications established by the federal commission.
"We knew the river was going to rise for some time," Becker said Sunday. "It was just a matter of when."
The nuclear plant has been preparing for the flooding since May 30. More than 5,000 tons of sand has been brought in to construct barricades around it and access roads, according to NPPD.
The Army Corps of Engineers said the river level at Brownville had surged about 2 feet from Saturday morning to Sunday morning and that it continued to rise because of heavy rain on the Nishnabotna River, which flows into the Missouri River from Iowa, and due to some erosion along a levee upstream at Hamburg, Iowa, that created a water pulse.
The Cooper Nuclear Station is one of two plants along the Missouri River in eastern Nebraska. The Fort Calhoun Station, operated by the Omaha Public Power District, is about 20 miles north of Omaha. It issued a similar alert to the regulatory commission June 6.
The river has risen at least 1.5 feet higher than Fort Calhoun's 1,004-foot elevation above sea level. The plant can handle water up to 1,014 feet, according to OPPD. The water is being held back by a series of protective barriers, including an 8-foot rubber wall outside the reactor building.
Its reactor already had been shut down for refueling and maintenance since April, and it won't be turned on again until the flooding subsides.
The entire plant still has full electrical power for safety systems, including those used to cool radioactive waste. It also has at least nine backup power sources.
A spokesperson for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said the NRC thinks OPPD managers have "done everything that they need to do to respond to the current conditions" at the nuclear plant.
Over the weekend, several northern Missouri levees failed to hold back the raging floodwaters, and the hole in a Holt County levee that ruptured last week continued to grow.
Recent rain increased the amount water in the already swollen river, and floodwaters from the breached levee south of Hamburg, Iowa, rushed back into the river over the weekend through a notch cut in the levee south of the last week's break.
The floodwater in Missouri has covered thousands of acres of farmland and soaked numerous homes and cabins. The recreational community of Big Lake, which is home to a state park and less than 200 people, is being threatened by the floodwater.
Most of Big Lake's residents have already evacuated. The area 78 miles north of Kansas City has been high for the past couple weeks, has experienced major flooding in three of the last five years.

“Words matter when you run for President,” Hillary Clinton said toward the end of Monday night's happening at Hofstra University, on Long Island. Clinton was criticizing Donald Trump for their loose language regarding America's allies in Asia, but they could have been summing up the lopsided debate, which saw them doing virtually everything they needed to do while Trump indicted themselves with their own words.
As anybody familiar with Clinton's career could have predicted, they were extremely well prepared for their first debate against Trump. After finding an opening to voice the key theme of their campaign early on—“We have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top”—she spoke confidently and with precision more or less throughout. Although some of their attack lines sounded rehearsed—“Trumped-up trickle-down” was one that they repeated—they were still effective. They didn't say anything that will come back to haunt her, and their only really awkward moments came when their opponent attacked them for reversing their position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Trump, on the other hand, had evidently been telling the truth, for once, when, in the lead-up to Monday night, they said they didn't believe in spending a lot of time on debate prep. Their spontaneity and direct language played to their advantage in some of the debate's early exchanges. But, as the night wore on, and as the discussions got more detailed, their lack of respect for the format got them into all sorts of trouble.
First, there were their errors of omission. Trump's harsh stance on immigration and their depiction of Clinton and other professional politicians as puppets of corporate interests have both helped propel their campaign to this point. But on Monday, speaking before an enormous national audience, they barely mentioned the wall they want to build across the U.S. border with Mexico, and they didn't bring up Clinton's ties to monied interests at all.
Then there was the damage done by the things they did say. At one point, Lester Holt, the moderator, asked Trump about their refusal to release their tax returns, a subject that Trump must have known would come up. They replied by saying that they would release their returns “when she”—Clinton—“releases their thirty-three thousand e-mails that have been deleted.” Perhaps Trump thought they were being smart with this answer, but it only gave Clinton a chance to respond, which they did with relish.
“So you've got to ask yourself: Why won't they release their tax returns?” they said, seizing the moment. “Maybe he's not as rich as they say they are . . . maybe he's not as charitable as they claim to be.” Then Clinton raised another theory, one that I and others have written about: “Or maybe they don't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes.”
Here, you'd expect the target of the attack to sense the danger. Evidently, Trump didn't. Having interrupted Clinton during most of their previous answers, they did so again. “That makes me smart,” they said.
Even on Twitter, where people were pulling apart Trump's words with the relish of a class of third graders dissecting a worm, it took a few seconds for this statement to sink in. Had they really just boasted that they didn't pay any federal taxes? Indeed, they had.
And that wasn't the end of it. After Clinton pointed out the implications of Trump's boast—“So if he's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health”—Holt changed the subject and asked about their e-mails. They said what they have said before: that setting up a private e-mail server while serving as Secretary of State was a mistake, for which they accepted responsibility.
A better, less cavalier debater than Trump would have seized on this opportunity to do what Clinton had just done to him: pull the scab off and poke around. They could, for example, have brought up the F.B.I. director James Comey's pointed criticisms of Clinton's handling of their e-mail. But they did nothing of the sort. Instead, after making a few comments about how one of the technicians who set up the server took the Fifth, refusing to answer questions from Congress, Trump changed the subject back to their own gaping wound, saying, “As far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you.”
There followed another brief peroration about how rich they are, and how it was “about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money." Thanks to know-nothing politicians like Clinton and President Obama, Trump said, the United States is now twenty trillion dollars in debt. "We have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don't have the money, because it's been squandered on so many of your ideas." Clinton, one imagined, could barely wait to get in their riposte. It was worth waiting for: "And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years,” they said.
To this viewer, at least, Trump seemed oblivious to the harm they were wreaking upon himself. Instead, they seemed almost to be revelling in it. Perhaps Trump believes that soccer moms in suburban Philadelphia and janitors in Ohio will warm to them for their ability to avoid paying taxes on what they referred to as their "tremendous income." Perhaps they also think the voters will reward them for stiffing their workers, cheating their suppliers, and reneging on their businesses debts. That is about the only way to rationalize their insouciant answers when Clinton, again showing their preparedness, started to delve into some of the less salubrious aspects of their business career, of which there are many.
"I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald," Clinton said, baldly but calmly. "I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers—like my dad was—who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your club houses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what they were charging you to do."
Rather than letting Clinton deliver their spiel and then moving on to another question, Trump interrupted again. "Maybe they didn't do a good job, and I was unsatisfied with their work," they said. Clinton wasn't put off. After asking whether all the people Trump had cheated weren't owed an apology, they brought up their father again, saying that they were relieved they "never did business with you. They provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people they worked for, they expected the bargain to be kept on both sides." Then Clinton reminded the audience that Trump businesses have entered bankruptcy six times, adding, "There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once."
Trump simply couldn't zip it and move on. "I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world," they said. Then, referring to the bankruptcies, they added, "Four times . . . we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but [I've] taken advantage of the laws of the nation. Now, if you want to change the laws, you've been there a long time; change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that's what I do."
They couldn't have said it any more clearly: that's what they do. It was good of them to put in on the record, and in a Presidential debate, no less. And it was Clinton who lured them into doing it.

“Nobody ever touches me,” a friend recently lamented. I could sympathize. In my 20s, I was in the same situation—unmarried and living far from my parents. As a teacher in a public junior high school even my job was strictly touch-free. Faculty were routinely warned against so much as placing a hand on a student's shoulder, and once an anonymous co-worker filed a sexual harassment complaint against a single male teacher who sometimes stopped to talk to me on their free period. With no spouse and no nearby relatives, I returned untouched every evening to a quiet room and a stack of papers, often spending several days in a row without so much as a handshake of human contact.
Now, one husband and three young children later, my life is filled with touch: hand-holding, hair-stroking, and crack-your-ribs hugging. In fact, I frequently long for some isolation. But I haven't forgotten my earlier life. And when I read my Bible, even in the middle of one of my leave-me-alone funks, I can't ignore the fact that five times—five!—in the New Testament, we are commanded to touch other Christians (Rom. 16:16, I Cor. 16:20, 2 Cor. 13:12, I Thess. 5:26, 1Pet. 5:14).
It's a challenge. With touch in our culture so often either co-opted by sexualization or horrifically corrupted by abuse, the right expression of physical affection in the Christian church is difficult to figure out. But I want the church to try.
Public Rap
In a May article for The American Conservative, “Our Starved for Touch Culture,” Leah Libresco grieves the lack of touch for many in our society. They theorize that we have abandoned friendly touch because it has been too-frequently tainted or overtaken by ulterior motives of sexual intimacy: “The friendzone is treated as a wasteland not just because we treat sex as an idol, but because friendship and non-sexual affection is written off as irrelevant. Casual dating has been replaced by casual sex; platonic touch has been eclipsed by erotic signalling.” (Albert Mohler has written a thought-provoking essay making a similar argument.)
In addition I suspect that instances of abuse have done their nasty work to bring touch low. Particularly in the church, we are rightly sickened by our public rap sheet of abusers—often church leaders or clergy—who corrupted touch and abused vulnerable human beings to serve their own sinful desires.
We have, on every church roll, people who still suffer the effects of inappropriate touch. We worship weekly alongside men and women who have themselves touched others in sinful ways. We also, often unknowingly, enjoy fellowship with those who have been abused. We must not forget to treat our brothers and sisters with especial tenderness, aware that we may not know what they have experienced.
We are right to be cautious. In touching, just as in talking and looking, much can go wrong. But rejecting biblical imperatives poses danger, too. The New Testament “holy kiss” actually stands against many of the touch-corruptions in our day. What is a holy kiss? It's a culturally appropriate, morally chaste, physical expression of love for other believers. It's a hand on a shoulder, a warm smile with a hand-clasp, or a friendly hug—a touch that publicly acknowledges our bond with other members of Christ's body. It's not just a kiss, it's a holy kiss, a kiss reclaimed from a fallen world and repurposed for the glory of God.
And it's not optional. Pastor A. N. Martin notes that in 2 Corinthians 13:12, the holy kiss comes at the end of a list of imperatives that we would unanimously consider Christian obligations: rejoice, aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace, greet one another with a holy kiss. One of the essential marks of the body of Christ is physical affection.
Wide Diversity
We might be tempted to think of the holy kiss as a practice for a particular first-century culture, too fraught with issues for our day. But this imperative covers the wide diversity of the New Testament church. Paul commands it, and Peter commands it, too. It is required of the Jewish-background diaspora recipients of Peter's epistle, and also of the Roman and Thessalonian churches—bodies largely composed of Gentile converts. Twice, the holy kiss is commanded for the Corinthian church, a church so beleaguered by sexual impropriety that you'd think the apostle Paul would ban touch altogether.
In many ways, this requirement best guards against perversion. “Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss,” reads 1 Thessalonians 5:26 (emphasis mine). The holy kiss is not subject to personal choice and individual preference. Touch in the church is not offered to someone we especially like as a sign that they or they have been singled out for intimate attention. The holy kiss is not exclusive. In contrast to the man in James 2:2-4 who tells the rich man to sit here and the poor man to stand over there, we must not show partiality in physical nearness to our brothers. We don't touch only the people of our choosing; we touch the people of God's covenant choosing. We give a holy kiss to all the brothers.
And the holy kiss does not accomplish goals of our personal choosing. It is not to the end of asserting power or manipulating someone into sealing a business deal—or scam, as Libresco notes. It is not for our own physical pleasure. (Treat “older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity,” Paul writes in 1 Timothy 5:2.) Instead, the holy kiss is what Martin calls “visible, physical confirmation of mutual love.”
Last Sunday, my church celebrated the Lord's Supper. I looked at my hand and at the cupped hands of my brothers and sisters, each of us holding a piece of bread. And I gave thanks that Jesus has given us something to touch. The sacraments are themselves a holy kiss of sorts—a visible, physical confirmation of mutual love.
Vandals target Wichita church, donor steps in to help Copyright by KSNW - All rights reserved Video
WICHITA, Kansas - After vandals targeted a Wichita church and cut wires to their security camera system, a donor stepped in to help repair the damage.
"These are the wires that were cut, and this was the screen that I walked into the night before Christmas Eve," described Pastor Jackie Carter.
Carter and several other church members were preparing for Christmas Eve service when they realized someone had snipped all ten wires that were connected to security cameras surrounding the First Metropolitan Community Church. The damage will cost thousands.
"It made me very scared. It made everybody that was here scared," Carter explained.
But, this is not the first incident of vandalism that FMCC has experienced.
"We've replaced 88 windows now in this church over the past 14 months, and it just isn't stopping," stated Carter.
A viewer in Wichita saw KSN's story that aired Christmas Eve about the incident, and wanted to anonymously donate time and money to fix all ten cameras.
"There's been a young man who has volunteered to come and help us see the cost of the repair is and do as much repair as they are capable of doing, which our hope is that that will take care of the situation," Carter said.
Starting this weekend, Pastor Carter says, they will feel secure in the place they call home. The anonymous donor will replace the cut wires and have the system running by Saturday night.
One act of kindness shown by an individual is now inspiring a whole congregation.
"I'm so grateful for that. That is the encouraging piece to me. That is the piece that gives us the ability to keep replacing the windows," Carter said.
As soon as we ask what creativity is, we invariably ponder the essential question of where good ideas come from and how we can coax them into manifesting. In 1926, Graham Wallace proposed a pioneering model for the four stages of the creative process, which was adapted into a five-step “technique for producing ideas” in 1939, and went on to influence present theories about the creative process. But despite what psychologists may delineate, the best answers come from the trenches and the front lines — from the artists, writers, inventors, and other creative troopers who summon and wrangle ideas for a living.
In this fantastic conversation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, LIVE from the NYPL host and interviewer extraordinaire Paul Holdengräber poses this very question — where do ideas come from? — to legendary director David Lynch.
Lynch, who answers with equal parts irreverence and insight, speaks to the fragmentary nature of creativity and its combinatorial quality, echoing Arthur Koetsler's seminal 1964 “bisociation theory” of how creativity works.
An idea comes — and you see it, and you hear it, and you know it… We don't do anything without an idea. So they're beautiful gifts. And I always say, you're desiring an idea is like a bait on a hook — you can pull them in. And if you catch an idea that you love, that's a beautiful, beautiful day. And you write that idea down so you won't forget it. And that idea that you caught might just be a fragment of the whole — whatever it is you're working on — but now you have even more bait. Thinking about that small fragment — that little fish — will bring in more, and they'll come in and they'll hook on. And more and more come in, and pretty soon you might have a script — or a chair, or a painting, or an idea for a painting. [They come], more often than not, in small fragments.
Pair with Lynch on the role of meditation in creative work, then revisit more explorations of how ideas are born from Neil Gaiman, Rod Serling, and Alice Walker.

It pays less than most starting teachers' salaries and has tougher odds than a position at Google, but don't let that deter you from applying for this best of all the jobs: the Giant Panda Protection and Research Center in China's Sichuan province has launched a worldwide search for panda cub caretakers.
Chinadaily USA reports that the job lasts for a year and pays 200,000 yuan, equivalent to about $32,500, as well as an SUV for transport and meals and accommodations. Current panda nannies, mostly volunteers, come from Europe, the U.S., and Japan–but as part of a program designed to increase global awareness of the needs of panda conservation, the organizers have decided to create a paid position. It's unclear how many slots are available, but the campaign also includes the recruitment of eight panda observers for a three-day stint.
According to an organizer who spoke with Chinadaily USA, “you need perseverance for this job. We expect that the applicants will be mainly white-collar workers from big cities. They are used to eating whatever they want, but inside the giant panda base, the choices will not be plentiful.” The recruiters also cite a need for good writing skills (presumably to share experiences in a way that will convey a meaningful message), as well as an ability to take pictures. The search runs from now through July 15, and applications are being accepted at fun.sohu.com, although good luck navigating it. Reportedly, more than 100,000 applications have already been received.
In addition to the above requirements, candidates should be at least 22 years old and have “some basic knowledge of pandas.” They're black and white and eat bamboo, pick me!
588th Night Bomber regiment in 1942.
Snipers Natalya Kovshova and Mariya Polivanova became posthumous heros of the Soviet Union after committing suicide in battle to avoid capture by German forces.
Soviet women played an important role in World War II (whose Eastern Front was known as the Great Patriotic War in the Soviet Union). While most toiled in industry, transport, agriculture and other civilian roles, working double shifts to free up enlisted men to fight and increase military production, a sizable number of women served in the army. The majority were in medical units.
There were 800,000 women who served in the Soviet Armed Forces during the war,[1] which is roughly 3 percent of total military personnel.[2] The number of women in the Soviet military in 1943 was 348,309, 473,040 in 1944, and then 463,503 in 1945.[3] Of the medical personnel in the Red Army, 40% of paramedics, 43% of surgeons, 46% of doctors, 57% of medical assistants, and 100% of nurses were women.[4] Nearly 200,000 were decorated and 89 of them eventually received the Soviet Union's highest award, the Hero of the Soviet Union, among which some served as pilots, snipers, machine gunners, tank crew members and partisans, as well as in auxiliary roles.[5][6]
At first, when Germany attacked the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, thousands of women who volunteered were turned away. However, after massive losses in the face of Operation Barbarossa, attitudes had to be changed, ensuring a greater role for women who wanted to fight. In the early stages of the war, the fastest route to advancement in the military for women was service in medical and auxiliary units.
Pilots [ edit ]
Yekaterina Budanova , one of two women to become a flying ace in the war.
For Soviet women aviators, instrumental to this change was Marina Raskova, a famous Soviet aviator, often referred to as the "Russian Amelia Earhart". Raskova became famous as both a pilot and a navigator in the 1930s. They were the first woman to become a navigator in the Red Air Force in 1933. A year later they started teaching at the Zhukovsky Air Academy, also a first for a woman. When World War II broke out, there were numerous women who had training as pilots and many immediately volunteered. While there were no formal restrictions on women serving in combat roles, their applications tended to be blocked, run through red tape, etc. for as long as possible in order to discourage them from seeing combat. Raskova is credited with using their personal connections with Joseph Stalin to convince the military to form three combat regiments for women. Not only would the women be pilots, but the support staff and engineers for these regiments were women. Although all three regiments had been planned to have women exclusively, only the 588th would remain an all-women regiment. The Soviet Union was the first nation to allow women pilots to fly combat missions. These regiments with strength of almost a hundred airwomen, flew a combined total of more than 30,000 combat sorties, produced at least twenty Heroes of the Soviet Union, and included two fighter aces. This military unit was initially called Aviation Group 122 while the three regiments received training. After their training, the three regiments received their formal designations as follows:
The 586th Fighter Aviation Regiment: This unit was the first to take part in combat (April 16, 1942) of the three female regiments and take part in 4,419 combat missions (125 air battles and 38 kills). Lydia Litvyak and Yekaterina Budanova were assigned to the unit before joining the 437th IAP in the fighting over Stalingrad and became the world's only two female fighter aces (with 5 each, although soviet propaganda claims 12 and 11 victories respectively), both flying the Yak-1 fighter.
The 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment: This was the best known of the regiments and was commanded by Yevdokiya Bershanskaya. It originally began service as the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, but was redesignated in February 1943 as recognition for service which would tally almost 24,000 combat missions by the end of the war. Their aircraft was the Polikarpov Po-2, an outdated biplane. The Germans were the ones however who gave them the name that they are most well known as, The Night Witches.
The 125th Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment: Marina Raskova commanded this unit until their death in combat, and then the unit was assigned to Valentin Markov. It started service as the 587th Bomber Aviation Regiment until it was given the Guards designation in September 1943.

The Soviet Union deployed women as snipers. Between 1941 and 1945, a total of 2,484 soviet female snipers were functioning in this role, of whom about 500 survived the war.[7][8] Their combined tally of kill claims is at least 11,000.[9] The most famous snipers during the war included Lyudmila Pavlichenko and Roza Shanina.
Women served particurarly as medics, communication personnel and political officers, as well – in small numbers – as machine gunners, tank drivers, etc. Manshuk Mametova was a machine gunner from Kazakhstan and was the first Asian woman to receive the Hero of the Soviet Union for acts of bravery. Mariya Oktyabrskaya and Alexandra Samusenko were tank drivers. Tatyana Kostyrina had over 120 kills and commanded an infantry battalion in 1943 following the death of their commander and a majority of the staff.[10][unreliable source]
Women crewed the majority of the anti-aircraft batteries employed in Stalingrad. Some batteries, including the 1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, also engaged in ground combat.
In response to the high casualties suffered by male soldiers, Stalin allowed planning which would replace men with women in second lines of defense, such as anti-aircraft guns and medical aid. These provided gateways through which women could gradually become involved in combat. For example, women comprised 43% of physicians, who were sometimes required to carry rifles as they retrieved men from firing zones. Through small opportunities like this, women gradually gained credibility in the military, eventually numbering 500,000 at any given time toward the end of the war.
Partisans [ edit ]
Partisan Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, one of the most celebrated partisans in Soviet media.
Women consistituted significant numbers of the Soviet partisans. One of the most famous was Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya. In October 1941, still an 18-year-old high school student in Moscow, they volunteered for a partisan unit. At the village of Obukhovo near Naro-Fominsk, Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the Germans. They were arrested by the Nazis on a combat assignment near the village of Petrischevo (Moscow Oblast) in late November 1941. Kosmodemyanskaya was savagely tortured and humiliated, but did not give away the names of their comrades or their real name (claiming that it was Tanya). They were hanged on November 29, 1941. It was claimed that before their death Kosmodemyanskaya had made a speech with the closing words, "There are two hundred million of us; you can't hang us all!" Kosmodemyanskaya was the first woman to become Hero of the Soviet Union during the war (February 16, 1942).
The youngest woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union was also a resistance fighter, Zinaida Portnova. They were visiting an aunt when the Germans invaded and was trapped behind German lines. In 1942, aged 15, after seeing the brutality of the occupying troops, Portnova joined the partisan movement in the Byelorussian SSR. They hid weapons for partisans, distributed leaflets and conducted sabotage. In January 1944 they were captured. They shot one of their captors whilst trying to escape but was caught and killed, just short of their 18th birthday. In 1958 Portnova was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union, there is a monument to them in the city of Minsk and some youth pioneer movement detachments were named after them
Soviet Women Soldiers: Propaganda and Experiences [ edit ]

Soviet Heroines in War Propaganda [ edit ]
Throughout World War II, women appeared in Soviet war propaganda in various capacities. Between 1939 and 1941, wary of German militarism and expansionism, Soviet propaganda encouraged women to undertake paramilitary civil defense training.[11] After the German invasion in 1941, propaganda portrayed women participating in war-related industries, in the medical sector, or in partisan units.[12] Before the severe manpower shortages of 1942, women were prohibited from serving in combat positions, and Soviet propaganda celebrated women's contributions on the home front.[13] In March 1942, when the People's Commissariat of Defense began enlisting women to replace male casualties in some combat roles, Soviet propaganda began honoring individual war heros.[14]
The USSR utilized propaganda celebrating heroic servicewomen to recruit more female soldiers. As a result, the state directed these stories only towards female workers that could be spared for front line service. Magazines for women in industrial jobs, such as Rabotnitsa, called upon readers to fulfill their patriotic duty and take up arms like other brave female soldiers. Since agricultural work was vital for the war effort, articles for peasant women addressed females only as partisans. Media coverage ignored the broader contribution of female soldiers and concealed the number of women in combat positions.[15]
As the number of female soldiers increased, state media could no longer ignore their contribution to the war effort. When designated for a broader audience, propaganda emphasized the femininity of female soldiers, who were portrayed as pretty, energetic, and spirited. These women kept culture alive in the male dominated units, encouraging cleanliness among their male comrades. Propaganda represented older female soldiers as motherly figures, caring for the male soldiers, while younger women assumed a sisterly image. In this context, Soviet propaganda depicted the armed forces as a family, courageously defending the motherland against the Fascist invasion.[16]
Difficulties Faced by Soviet female soldiers [ edit ]
Despite their romantic portrayal in Soviet propaganda, female soldiers faced challenges in the male-dominated military. First, the women struggled to obtain combat roles on the front lines. The 1936 Stalin constitution asserted that Soviet women were fully emancipated, but the state still considered women unsuited for combat.[17] As a result, when war broke out in 1941, the state rejected thousands of female volunteers eager to defend the motherland on the front lines.[18] Even after the creation of all-female and mixed-gender combat units, some female soldiers were relegated to the rear. Women of the 1st Separate Women's Volunteer Rifle Brigade, assigned to domestic service detail, became frustrated by their lack of combat action and requested to be sent to the front. When these requests were denied, many deserted to the front to fight for the fatherland; if caught, the deserters were severely punished.[19]
Male–female relations in mixed-gender units posed a variety of challenges for women soldiers. Many women complained that the male-dominated military sought to defeminize servicewomen while denying them equal treatment, citing that it was one of the most difficult challenges they faced.[20][21] Male officers often undermined the authority of the few female officers. When female officers failed to maintain command over their subordinates, male officers blamed female inferiority. In some cases, the tense relations between male and female soldiers escalated to sexual harassment and assault. For example, the 1st Separate Women's Volunteer Rifle Brigade reported multiple instances of rape, resulting in sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies.[22]
Many women were unprepared for the harsh living conditions and tense gender relations they faced in combat units. Others were recruited despite the fact that they were ill, pregnant, unqualified, or unfit for military service. Some female soldiers struggled to adapt to military life, leading them to resort to extreme measures such as desertion or suicide. The Soviet military attributed these drastic actions to personal failings.[23]
Women, war, and the Soviet state [ edit ]
The strong contrast between the hardships of Soviet servicewomen and their portrayal in propaganda reveals the complex role of "emancipated" women in the male-dominated Soviet society. Conze and Fieseler argue that the first Bolsheviks asserted that women were equal in the USSR, but 1930s Stalinist propaganda promoted the image of women in the home, caring for their families. This ambivalent conception of women's role in society parallels the state's attitude towards females in the military; women's patriotic duty did not include combat until it became absolutely necessary. Even when the efforts of female soldiers could no longer be ignored, state propaganda concealed the full extent of their participation.[24]
Propaganda concerning female soldiers often functioned to preserve male societal dominance, portrayed them as motherly and sisterly figures, an image more consistent with women's role in Soviet society. Furthermore, propaganda emphasized that women joined the army for patriotic reasons, such as protecting the fatherland or avenging dead relatives. These commendable motivations explained women's ability to kill in combat, a phenomenon that contradicted established gender roles.[25]
The Soviet state resisted the deployment of servicewomen, using propaganda to justify female combatants after they became necessary.[26] Conze and Fieseler argue that once women soldiers were no longer needed, they stopped appearing in the media. The state prevented female soldiers from marching in the Moscow Victory Parade. The gains of servicewomen towards female emancipation were ignored after the war, and the state encouraged women to return to their duties at home.[27]

A small rodent in Australia is the world's first mammal to go extinct due to human-made climate change, according to a report published Tuesday.
The Bramble Cay melomys, which lived only on a small, 10-acre, sand-covered island in the Great Barrier Reef between Australia and Papua New Guinea, probably went extinct due to rising sea levels, scientists said.
Ocean waters inundated the low-lying island several times over the past decade, likely leading to the animal's disappearance, study author Luke Leung of the University of Queensland said.
The ocean water caused dramatic habitat loss and perhaps drowned many of the animals. The island sits, at most, about 10 feet above sea level, the study said.
The scientists conducted a thorough survey of the island in August and September 2014 and failed to find a single living example of the rodent. The last known sighting occurred in 2009, when the animal a fisherman spotted the animal.
The University of Queensland and the Queensland state government prepared the study. Researchers say there's still a chance the species, or a close relative, may exist somewhere in Papua New Guinea, although it's never been spotted there.
Heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels cause temperatures to rise and glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, leading to rising sea levels. Another cause of sea-level rise is because oceans are warmer — water expands when its warmer, taking up more space, according to NOAA.
If human-made climate change proceeds as expected, one in six species worldwide could face extinction, the journal Science said in a 2015 study. Other recent Science studies found species of plants and animals are becoming extinct at least 1,000 times faster than they did before humans appeared.

Historical Context
The interjection eh — as in “I know, eh?” — is popularly considered to be a marker of Canadian speech. Canadians use eh more frequently than in any other country, and also have the most varied usage of the interjection. While eh has only two main constructions in England (as a request for repetition and to mark a question), there are 10 popular functions of eh in Canada, making it a true Canadianism. However, studies suggest that its usage is in decline, particularly among young, urbane Canadians. (See also Canadian English.)
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Modern English eh derives from Middle English interjections such as ey, ei and a. The modern spelling, eh, could have developed independently from Middle English variants; however, it was most likely adopted from the French eh. The use of eh as a demand for repetition compares with Chaucer's use of I in Troilus and Criseyde (c. 1380s):
For love of God, make of this thing an ende,
Or slee us both at ones er that ye wende
[...] ‘I, what?' quod she. ‘By God and by my trouthe,
I noot not what ye wilne that I saye.
By the 18th century, eh was in use as an interjectional interrogative particle (a verbal question mark), and circa 1772–73 Irish novelist and playwright Oliver Goldsmith included the line, “Wasn't it lucky, eh?” in their play They Stoop to Conquer. Eh as a request for repetition such as “Eh? What's that, Sackville?” appears by the 19th century.
Although eh has its roots in Middle English and did not originate in Canada, the interjection acts as marker of anglophone Canadian identity and distinguishes Canadian English from other dialects. Eh is internationally recognized as a uniquely Canadian form of speech, often to the point of exaggeration and stereotype.
Critical Context
While linguists have mostly ignored eh as an outdated symbol of Canadian identity, there has been some debate as to whether the interjection constitutes a Canadianism. The notion that eh was a uniquely Canadian interjection came to public attention in the early 1970s, when Toronto lawyer Mark M. Orkin and professor of English Walter S. Avis debated its significance in Canada. The debate began when Orkin listed eh as part of Canadian English in the book Speaking Canadian English (1970). In their paper “So eh? is Canadian, eh?,” Walter S. Avis responded to Orkin and argued that “eh is no Canadianism — for it did not originate in Canada and is not peculiar to the English spoken in Canada.” Avis argued that because dictionaries do not recognize eh as a Canadian expression, it must be part of a universal language. Many dictionaries today, however, do classify eh as a Canadianism, including the Cambridge Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Encarta Dictionary, American History Dictionary and the Canadian Oxford Dictionary. Sandra Schecter entered the debate in 1979 with their essay “Eh? Revisited: Is it or Is It Not Canadian?” arguing that eh is a central component of Canadian identity.
10 Different Constructions of Eh
A 2004 survey on Canadian contemporary uses of eh shed light on the debate. Linguist Elaine Gold questioned students in their Introduction to Linguistics course at the University of Toronto about their use of and attitude toward 10 different constructions of eh. Of the 109 respondents, 35 were males and 74 were females — all were 30 years of age or younger.
While some linguists agree that eh is a marker of Canadian speech, they disagree over what type of eh is uniquely Canadian. Dictionaries cite one of two main uses: eh as a question tag; or, the narrative eh.
Gold's survey helps to clarify the matter by asking Canadian speakers if and how they use eh. Both individually and collectively, the dictionaries (listed above) do not come close to citing the many nuances of eh. Gold's survey provides the most extensive list of the different variations. Although the survey provides useful information on Canadians' use of and attitude toward eh, there are some limitations to this method of data collection. As Gold explains, “one problem with this method of self-reporting is that many speakers are unaware of their own use of eh.” Speakers are especially unaware of their use of the narrative eh because it often serves as a comma, question mark or an unconscious pause (similar to um, like or ah). The following table lists the 10 categories (and 12 examples) used in Gold's survey:
Type of Eh Sample Sentence 1. Statement of opinion Nice day, eh? 2. Statements of fact It goes over here, eh? 3. Commands Open the window, eh? Think about it, eh? 4. Exclamations What a game, eh? 5. Questions What are they trying to do, eh? 6. To mean “pardon” Eh? What did you say? 7. In fixed expressions Thanks, eh? I know, eh? 8. Insults You're a real snob, eh? 9. Accusations You took the last piece, eh? 10. Telling a story [the narrative eh] This guy is up on the 27th floor, eh? then they get out on the ledge, eh...
For each of the 10 categories, the survey asks respondents if they have heard that particular type of use, whether they use it themselves and whether their attitude to the usage is positive, neutral or negative. Most of the respondents have heard people use the 10 different types of eh, with recognition rates ranging from 50 to 100 per cent. The following expressions rank as the top three for both usage and recognition: statements of opinion, exclamations, and the expression “I know, eh?” What is really interesting is that while dictionaries and linguists classify the narrative eh as Canadian, the Canadian-born respondents claim to use the narrative eh the least of the 10 categories. The narrative eh also receives the highest negative response.
Canadian Stereotype
Despite the reported aversion toward the narrative eh, lexicographers equate the narrative eh with Canada. Walter Avis was unable to find examples of the narrative eh in literature from any other country besides Canada, which suggests that this type of eh is peculiar to Canada. This divisive attitude towards the narrative eh captures the larger attitude towards eh as a unique Canadianism: Canadians do not identify as users of the narrative eh but it is internationally recognized as a symbol of Canada and a lingual marker of Canadian identity.
Popular culture, for instance, equates the narrative eh with Canadians. Literature and film often use eh as a deliberate stereotype: the 1995 film Canadian Bacon satirizes American stereotypes of Canada by portraying a friendly Mountie who uses the narrative eh. In Elaine Gold's survey, some respondents describe the speaker of the narrative eh (number 10 in the survey) as “an American trying to imitate a Canadian.” As Gold says, “it is clear that the narrative eh is considered to be both stereotypically Canadian and highly stigmatized, a fact reflected in the highly negative attitudes assigned to this use.”
Significance
Whether Canadians use eh or not, people identify it as a marker of Canadian English. Within Canada, eh is popular from coast to coast. Linguists, dictionaries, novels and popular culture all recognize eh as a distinctive part of Canadian English. As Sandra Schecter says,
can you think of any people aside from Canadians who take an active pride in “eh?” and are determined to claim it as their own? Where else do so many academics and laypeople spend so much time arguing about it? Is this not in itself evidence that “eh?” is a component of that elusive phenomenon called “Canadian identity”?

Owners of the Google Chromecast looking for more exciting things to do with the streaming HDMI dongle might want to set their eyes on this new PwnedCast custom ROM. While it offers just a few advantages over the stock firmware, this could eventually open up the device for more adventurous tinkering and modifications.
Beyond the hype and novelty of the Chromecast, the things one can do with the device is quite limited, especially without involving some sort of hack or mod. Some rather creative, not to mention diligent, developers have created ways to get around Google's lockdown of the device, either by allowing streaming of local media or, as in the case of KyoCast, opening up the device to more streaming services beyond the officially sanctioned ones.
But there is already a precedent of Google trying to foil such attempts through firmware updates. Now one way of getting around that is through this custom ROM, creatively named PwnedCast, that is based on the 13300 stock image. The ROM adds some new features that will be of interest to developers and modders, such as SSH/Telnet access, a custom boot image, and a preinstalled KyoCast.
There are a few caveats to the ROM. While it does get around the mandatory Google OTA updates that could potentially close up the device in the future, it does feature its own automatic OTA updates in the background. Luckily, that can be disabled using instructions here but it isn't as straightforward or easily discoverable. And, of course, it is a custom image, so a bit of risk is to be expected.

Doctors often say children with autism should be diagnosed as early as possible, because early intervention before a child turns 3 can greatly improve their or their development.
However, the developmental disorder may be tough for doctors to diagnose at an early age. Many children do not receive a final diagnosis until they reach 4 years old, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Now, researchers say they have discovered that examining the placenta -- an organ that provides nutrients from the mother to the baby -- at birth may reveal clues about their new child's risk for developing the developmental disorder.
"At birth we have a tool now that can tell us who's at risk and who isn't at risk for autism," study author Dr. Harvey Kliman, a scientist in the department of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., told USA Today.
CDC reports 1-in-50 children have autism
Autism spectrum disorders are a group of developmental disabilities ranging in severity that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral deficits. Approximatelyone in 50U.S. schoolchildren are diagnosed with autism, rates that rose from an estimated one in 88 children only one year earlier.
Kliman and their team examined 117 placentas from infants of families that had one or more previous children with autism. Couples who have a child with autism are nine times more likely to have another diagnosed with the disorder, they said.
The families were enrolled in an autism study that searched for markers of disease risk in babies. The placentas from at-risk infants were compared to 100 other placentas from children living in the same geographic area.
Abnormal placental folds signal autism risk at birth. Yale University,Patrick Lynch
The researchers saw that placentas from at-risk babies had more abnormal cell growths and folds called "trophoblast inclusions" than the placentas used for comparison. The at-risk placentas had up to 15 trophoblast inclusions, while none of the comparison placentas had more than two.
Kliman "conservatively" estimated four or more inclusions could predict almost a 97-percent likelihood that a child will be at risk for -- not necessarily be diagnosed with -- autism.
"I hope that diagnosing the risk of developing autism by examining the placenta at birth will become routine, and that the children who are shown to have increased numbers of trophoblast inclusions will have early interventions and an improved quality of life as a result of this test," they concluded in a statement.
The study was published April 25 in Biological Psychiatry.
Dr. Chris Mann Sullivan, a behavioral analyst in Morrisville, N.C., was not in the study, but sent their placenta to Kliman after their now 3-year-old daughter was born, the New York Times reported.
They found five inclusions, leading Sullivan to start intensive therapy with their daughter, who is now 3 and has some mild difficulties but has not been diagnosed with autism.
"What would have happened if I did absolutely nothing, I'm not sure," They told the Times. "I think it's a great way for parents to say, 'O.K., we have some risk factors; we're not going to ignore it.'"
Kliman told the paper the inclusions were like a "check-engine light" that may signal a problem.
Dr. Daniel Coury, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, praised the study but told HealthDay it's too soon to routinely test placentas for autism risk and more studies are needed.
"Being able to identify those infants at greater risk so we can target our interventions is really big news," they said.

ROBERTSON COUNTY, Texas (KWKT/KYLE) - Robertson County Sheriff Gerald Yezak and their deputies, Game Wardens and Department of Public Safety investigators have found an unused coal mining site had been " repurposed" by marijuana growers in a big way.
They discovered that an unused mining site belonging to Luminant had been used by unknown persons to become the home of a highly developed marijuana growing farm.
The "farm" was found at the site in the northeast part of the county and was highly developed with an irrigation system that included water lines, pumps and a generator.
There was also a camp site for use by those taking care of the plants..
The investigation began on Tuesday with the seizures going on into Thursday.
Over 5900 large marijuana plants with an estimated value of $2.9 million were seized, cut and hauled away.
So far, no arrests have been made.
Assistance in the seizure was acknowledged for Limestone County Sheriff Dennis Wilson, McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara along with Sheriff Kevin Ellis, Chief Investigator Victor Smith and Deputy Chris Rosales of Leon County.

CHENNAI: The Goods and Services Tax intelligence wing on Monday raided the office of Tamil actor Vishal's film production company -- Vishal Film Factory -- in Chennai following information that they had allegedly evaded service tax to the tune of several lakhs of rupees.The raid happened a day after a vicious spat between Vishal and BJP leader H Raja overLed by four senior officials from the GST intelligence wing, the raid started in the afternoon."The raid started after 2 pm on the premises of the Vadapalani office of the production house. We are yet to know the extent of service tax evasion by the company. We have just started the searches after information collected for nearly one year," a senior GST intelligence official told TOI.However, a statement issued by the Chennai intelligence wing in the name of joint director PVK Rajasekar said no search operations had been conducted in the office. “News circulating about our officials entering the office is wrong,” it said.Vishal Film Factory, set up in 2013, has produced six films including “Kathakali,” “Naan Sigappu Manithan” and “Aambala.” Vishal played the lead role in all these movies.Vishal is also the president of the Tamil Film Producers' Council and general secretary of the Nadigar Sangam.
The Oil Export Crisis Has Arrived Venezuela and Mexico: The Point of the Exports Spear
Last March, my study of the effect of peak oil on U.S. imports had brought Mexico to the forefront. As our #3 source of imports, the crashing of its supergiant Cantarell field had put the future of our oil supply in serious jeopardy.
The possibility that Mexico's oil and gas exports to the U.S. could go to zero within seven years looked very real.
As I explained in that piece, rising domestic consumption coupled with declining supply puts an ever-tightening squeeze on imports. I have found no evidence that policymakers are paying any attention to this critically important dynamic, but it is the very point of the peak oil spear.
Were it not for the market meltdown and recession, it would have pierced our vital organs. Instead we felt a pinprick. Hardly anybody realized what it really was, and most ran off on a wild goose chase for evil oil speculators.
Now Venezuela has appeared on my radar for similar reasons... only this time, we're really going to feel it.
Let's begin with a review of Mexico's exports.
Mexico
Shortly after publishing that article, I casually remarked to my friend and fellow energy analyst Gregor Macdonald that Cantarell's production could fall to under 0.5 million barrels per day (mbpd) by the end of the year.
I arrived at this somewhat startling conclusion by calculating the effect of its decline rate — 38% at the time and accelerating — on production of 0.77 mbpd in January, down precipitously from its 2.1 mbpd peak in 2003.
Gregor's recent data sleuthing on Cantarell found its production in December 2009 was 0.527688 mbpd, just a hair above my estimate.
To update the data on Mexico, it's now our #2 source of imported petroleum because Saudi Arabia has fallen from #2 to #4.
As of November 2009 (the latest data available) the U.S. imported 1.08 mbpd of crude and finished petroleum products from Mexico. Its exports to the U.S. peaked at 1.46 mbpd in 2004, the same year as its production peaked. Net exports (production minus consumption) fell to 1.06 mbpd in 2008.

For the years 2005-2008, Mexico's exports to the U.S. declined by 0.51 barrels per day. In 2010, supply is expected to fall to 2.5 mbpd — nearly half a million barrels per day less than 2009.
Mexico nationalized its petroleum operations in 1938 in a constitutional amendment and handed over total control to the state oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), with predictable results.
Oil now provides more than 40% of the country's revenues, which have been used to pay for a vast array of public services and line the pockets of the oligarchy while starving investment in both upstream activities (new oil supply) and downstream (finished products).
Consequently, Mexico's oil reserves have decreased by more than 75% in two decades (owing partly to the correction of a previous, ridiculously inflated figure), production has begun to decline and exports are falling fast.
It now imports $4.5 billion a year worth of gasoline, $10 billion a year in petrochemicals, and 25% of its natural gas, mostly from the U.S. This despite having nearly 13 billion barrels of proven oil reserves and more than 50 billion barrels of (unproven) reserve potential.
Mexico would be in a far better position, were it not for its hostile stance on foreign participation. PEMEX simply lacks the technical ability to develop its more difficult, remaining resources — particularly deep water.
Venezuela
As of November, the U.S. was importing 0.9 mbpd from Venezuela, making it our #3 source. Its exports to the U.S. peaked at 1.8 mbpd in 1997, the same year as its production peaked. Net exports (production minus consumption) have fallen 38% from the 1997 peak of 3.1 mbpd to 1.9 mbpd in 2008.
Venezuela's oil exports to the U.S. have been declining markedly since 2004, after a long period of relative stability. From 2004 through 2009, Venezuelan petroleum exports fell 0.7 mbpd.

Like Mexico, Venezuela is endowed with enormous energy resources and could be producing at a far higher level. Estimates of its oil reserves range from 153 billion barrels of certified proven; to 513 billion barrels technically recoverable in the USGS' January estimate; to 1.5 trillion barrels in offshore potential, if you believe the effervescent Dr. Marcio Mello of Brazil.
Most of it is heavy oil, a low-grade which must be upgraded to synthetic crude.
And like Mexico, President Hugo Chavez has exiled the Western oil companies who might have made the investment to bring those resources to market.
A Nation in Free Fall
The good times rolled for Chavez in the first years after their election in 1998. Their socialist programs to rebuild the country and raise its standard of living were popular but expensive, and soon began to fail under the crush of declining energy supply.
Oil revenues make up 90% of Venezuela's foreign earnings, so its dependence on oil exports is extreme.
Billions of dollars in profits from the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) were diverted to welfare programs and into the pockets of oligarchs, while investment in future petroleum and power supply languished.
The precipitous drop in oil prices since mid-2008 only compounded the revenue shortfall.
Oil production has fallen 25% since Chavez was elected, and a long, devastating drought has cut into its hydropower supply, of which 73% comes from the massive Guri Dam.
Chavez responded by nationalizing most of its petroleum operations and its grid in 2007.
In 2009, another 76 oil services companies on the Maracaibo Lake were taken over. The projects now sit abandoned, waiting for PDVSA to compensate the displaced operators and put them back into operation.
Almost half a million hectares of land were seized in 2009 with the rationalization that it was underused.
Measures to counter the declining hydro supply have been implemented in a haphazard fashion, resulting in frequent, unscheduled blackouts, including seven national blackouts since 2007. Malls and government offices have had their hours of operation cut and water rationing has been imposed.
"Some people sing in the bath for half an hour,'' Chávez cried at a cabinet session in October. "What kind of communism is that? Three minutes is more than enough!''
In January, a wave of public protest erupted, prompting Chavez to implement a rapid series of desperate measures.
Rolling blackouts were imposed in the capital city of Caracas. After a few days of protests, Chavez lifted the blackouts and fired the electricity minister. Blackouts are expected to be reinstated in an effort to keep hydro reservoir levels from falling to the point of collapse.
A recent report gave the power shortage a paradoxical twist, indicating that power from one of the state refineries may have to be diverted to the grid, cutting distillate output by 200,000 barrels per day — or more. This will result in less heating oil for China, who will make up the loss by burning more coal.
Chavez devalued Venezuela's bolivar currency by half; the president went on to nationalize a chain of French-owned supermarkets over alleged price gouging.
They ordered cutbacks in the operation of state-run steel and aluminum manufacturing operations, which account for up to 20% of the country's power demand.
This week they turned to Cuba for help on how to cope with the power shortage, since Cuba has been through similar problems. The island nation is providing tens of thousands of energy-efficient lightbulbs and cloud-seeding technology to Venezuela.
Last weekend, they forced six television channels off the air for failing to broadcast one of their speeches — up to six hours in length — in a continuation of their campaign for "communicational hegemony." Since December, all radio and television networks are required by law to broadcast their speeches live, whenever they choose to make one.
Nationwide student marches have been met by troops armed with rubber bullets, and at least two deaths have been recorded.
Chavez has said he's prepared to take "radical measures" should the situation worsen, begging the unsettling question of what could be more radical than what they have already done.
Looking East, Not North
Now Chavez is turning east for help in developing their nation's oil and gas resources. Recent agreements include a $20 billion joint venture with Russia to develop the Junin 6 field in the Orinoco oil belt, with a potential top production rate of 450,000 barrels per day.
China has agreed to build a refinery and develop the Orinoco heavy oil fields, and Venezuela has guaranteed 560,000 barrels per day to China this year.
Venezuela has launched its first major auction for drilling rights in more than a decade, for access to areas east of the existing operations in the Orinoco. Developing the leases will be expensive because of their distance from the existing infrastructure, and winning bidders are expected to make offers in the $10 billion-plus range including early payments of at least $1 billion, financing plans, and commitments to build the necessary roads, pipelines, ports, and upgraders. Potential bidders include Spain's Repsol, Japan's Mitsubishi, the UK's BP, and Chevron.
Given the sheer size of its resources, it's too soon to declare the end of Venezuela's glory days in the oil patch. However, it does seem likely that the new barrels it brings to market will be headed east — not north — and Western producers will have very little stake in the projects.
Chavez will put exports to the U.S. on a short path to zero the first chance they get.
Oh Imports, Where Art Thou?
The combined decline in imports from Mexico and Venezuela for 2005 through 2008 is 0.89 mbpd. If the trend continues in 2009, then over 1 mbpd will have disappeared from the U.S. import stream in the last five years — a decline of 8% from 2004 levels.
Since 2007, the loss of production from Cantarell alone was 0.7 mbpd, but the recession cut U.S. demand by 2 mbpd, effectively masking the decline. This raises the question: If U.S. demand rises from here, where will those barrels come from... and how much will they cost?
The U.S. is not only in first place worldwide in its demand for oil, but in paying the market rate for it. Nobody else buys 8.5 mbpd of crude at retail.
Drivers in Venezuela are still filling up for 25 cents a gallon, even as their exports decline.
Mexico's gasoline prices are more on par with the U.S., but its consumption has been rising steadily since 1997 and continues to cut into exports.
Saudi Arabia's domestic consumption is currently growing at the rate of 7% per year, following a trend of more than three decades. It uses a whopping 1.5 mbpd — 1.8% of total world oil supply! — to desalinate water, at the equivalent of 7 cents a gallon.
Before the OPEC cuts of 2009, its exports to the U.S. had essentially flatlined at 1.5 mbpd since 2004.
Exports from our #5 source, Nigeria, have also declined — from 1.17 mbpd in 2005 to 0.98 mbpd in 2008.
In fact, of the top five oil exporting countries to the U.S., representing 63% of our crude imports, only Canada posted an increase (of 0.2 mbpd).
The combined annual net oil exports from our top three exporting countries — Canada, Mexico and Venezuela — illustrate our situation:

Given the very modest increases from unconventional domestic production and Canada, the decline of imports from Mexico and Venezuela means the U.S. will be increasingly forced to depend on suppliers farther afield — the very same suppliers that China has been buying into in size. The "collision course with China" that I wrote about in July 2005 has nearly reached the point of impact.
It also means that when oil prices rise again, the pain will be far greater for the U.S. than it is for our top suppliers. Next time, the spear of declining oil exports will puncture a lung.
The oil export crisis has arrived... We just haven't felt it yet.
Production, consumption, and export data herein is the latest available from the EIA.

The Commons have amended the EU withdrawal bill to ensure that it will get a vote on any final deal with the EU. So has parliament “taken back control”? Far from it – for two reasons.
First, any such vote will be on the UK's withdrawal agreement. By the time it comes, perhaps at the end of 2018, it will be difficult, maybe impossible, to make more than cosmetic changes. There will be no appetite in Brussels or among the EU27 member states to renegotiate. And if parliament did reject it, the impact would not be to stop Brexit, but rather to ensure that Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. Remember, as a result of parliament's own decision to authorise the government to send the official article 50 notification, we automatically leave the EU on 29 March, 2019, with or without a deal.
Moreover, there is a more fundamental problem. The withdrawal agreement will cover the topics of phase 1 of the negotiation – the deal that was agreed in principle, at a political level, last week. That is, it will cover citizens' rights, the financial settlement and the Irish border issue. It will also address the “transition” period we are about to negotiate.
EU leaders arrive at summit to discuss Brexit progress - Politics Live Read more
Why would parliament want to reject an agreement on any of these? On money, parliament won't vote to pay more than we agree, and the EU27 certainly won't accept less. On citizens' rights, most MPs are happy with the basic principle that EU citizens should be allowed to stay, and don't understand the technicalities. Voting down an agreement, adequate or otherwise, will do nothing to keep the Irish border open. And while some Brexiteers are understandably unhappy with a so-called “transition” – why would they not be, as it means merely all the rules and obligations of EU membership, but without a voice or a vote – nobody really has a better alternative.
What parliament really wants – and quite right too – is a say about the much more fundamental question that will be discussed in phase 3 of the negotiations – what will the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU look like? Will we seek to maintain, as far as possible, the current degree of economic integration with the EU, even after we leave its political structures? That is, do we seek to remain, formally or through some alternative arrangements, in the EU single market and/or customs union? Or do we seek to disengage and negotiate a “deep and comprehensive trade arrangement” with the EU – that is, a comprehensive free trade agreement, with nothing like the degree of regulatory convergence implied by the single market. The latter would mean a very significant increase in barriers to trade – formal and informal – with our largest trading partner, but on the other hand offers the opportunity to shape our own regulatory framework and to conclude trade deals with the rest of world.
That is a genuinely meaningful choice. It is not one that was on the referendum ballot, and there are former remainers and leavers on both sides of the divide. It is not one that has ever been properly debated or decided, either in parliament or the country. Much of the debate has been of the “cake and eat it” kind. Indeed, Theresa May has so far refused to even have a proper discussion in cabinet, since they know there is deep disagreement.
On this, the most fundamental issue, the EU27 aren't seeking to impose their views. As EU representatives have said repeatedly, we have a binary choice to make, but it is our choice. Indeed, at the European council this week, heads of government will say that negotiations can now move to the next phase; but they will also say that discussions on the “framework for the future relationship” can only begin after the UK makes clear what it actually wants. The ball is in our court.
After this week, I refuse to believe that Brexit is unstoppable | Martin Kettle Read more
But this is not something that parliament will be able to vote on in when it gets its “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement. By then it will be too late. The UK's negotiating position on this all-important aspect of Brexit will have to be set out in the next couple of months. If parliament actually wants a meaningful voice on this – perhaps the most important single choice about the future of the UK economy since the mid-1970s – it needs to act now.
It should insist that, before we table anything in Brussels for the phase 2 negotiations, there should be a proper debate in parliament. Let's settle the things we didn't and couldn't decide in the referendum. Do we care more about the freedom to set our own regulations or about being part of the largest single market in the world? Do we care more about ending free movement or about preserving free trade with Europe? Do we care more about “frictionless” borders in Ireland and Dover or about trade deals with the US? These are vitally important political and economic questions, with no “right” answers. And they shouldn't be left to a weak prime minister and their divided cabinet and party. Now is the time to take back control.

The security footage showing the lead-up to the shooting as the police officer aims their gun.
Authorities are investigating an incident on Monday where a police officer shot dead a pet dog in a street in Perth, Western Australia.
Security video, shown on Australia's Nine News, shows a male police officer drawing their gun when the Staffordshire Bull Terrier approaches him.
The video shows the dog, called Biggy, wagging its tail and then sitting down just before the officer fires a single shot and kills the dog.
Interviewed for the TV news report, the dog's owner Pat Wharram said they were disgusted by the actions of the police officer.
 They are threatening to sue the force.
"He was gunned down for nothing. They sat for him. They were wagging their tail. I'm just cut up by this," Wharram said.
"DISTURBING"
NINE NEWS Biggies and another one of Pat Wharram's dogs escaped from their home.
Police minister Liza Harvey told Radio 6PR that the incident was being investigated, describing the footage as "disturbing".
"What we'll be looking at was whether it was appropriate for that firearm to be discharged and used in this manner for that incident," they said.
"I'll leave that up to the authorities to investigate."
Nine News reported that Biggy and another one of Wharram's dogs escaped from their Banksia Grove home and walked roughly 10km to Kinross.
Police received reports the dogs had acted aggressively towards young families in a park. They were described as fighting each other and growling and baring their teeth - although no-one was attacked.
One of the dogs was caught by a ranger but Biggy ended up approaching the armed police officer.
Wharram says they are considering legal action against the police because they feel they were lied to.
"I'm just disgusted that the police told me lies. I was told they attacked an officer," they said.
Nine News reported that Western Australia police had released a statement saying that the officer had discharged their firearm because they feared they were about to be attacked.
Julian Assange has described life in the Ecuadorian Embassy as like “being in a space station” Mary Turner Times photographer
Julian Assange has used time living as a refugee at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to oversee the release today of an analysis by WikiLeaks of 1.7 million US diplomatic reports.
The founder of the whistleblowing website said it was releasing US diplomatic records from the beginning of 1973 to the end of 1976, including cables, intelligence reports and congressional correspondence.
But unlike the earlier controversial release of confidential US diplomatic cables, this time the documents are already in the public domain.
Mr Assange, 41, was granted asylum in the embassy last summer to avoid extradition to Sweden to face sexual offence claims by two women — charges they deny.
The Australian has said they are refusing to return to Sweden because they fear it…
Welcome to the bigs, Mr. Singh.
On Oct. 2, the day after Jagmeet Singh became leader of the NDP, they did an interview with Terry Milewski on CBC-TV. At the end of the interview, Milewski asked them to denounce Talwinder Parmar, the terrorist behind the 1985 Air India bombing, which killed 329 people, mostly Canadians.
Singh dodged the question repeatedly, suggested that Parmar might not be responsible for the bombing, and in a later scrum said that the question was racist.
Viewers complained to CBC about the segment, but on Dec. 6, the CBC ombudsman found, correctly, that Milewski, who has been covering the Air India tragedy for decades, was posing “a relevant journalistic question.”
So, in their first day in Ottawa, Singh failed to denounce a terrorist and made an unfounded accusation of racism. They looked like a talented rookie called up from the AHL complaining to the ref after their first time in the corners of a big rink.
Singh is an appealing, ambitious 38-year-old, and there is a large, friendly constituency open to their leadership, but their previous political experience as deputy leader of the Ontario NDP has not prepared them for this job, and they have surrounded themselves with inexperienced loyalists.

Longtime New Democrats are watching with concern. The new leader, who does not have a seat in the House of Commons, is spending a lot of time on the road, not a lot of time in Ottawa, which is—duh—where all the cameras are. They have no plans to run for a seat any time soon and their message, delivered to regional media outlets, often diverges from the message their caucus is pushing in Ottawa.
Singh is said to be a quick study, but the veterans who ran the operation for Jack Layton and Tom Mulcair are gone, meaning there is nobody on the coaching staff who can point Singh in the right direction.
On Nov. 6, at a get-to-know-the-new-leader meeting for NDP staff, Nasha Brownridge, the president of the union local that represents NDP workers on the Hill, asked Singh about banked overtime issues for staffers who were laid off during the election. Singh misunderstood the question and told the shocked staffers that politics sometimes requires people to work after 5 p.m. They later met with Brownridge to apologize, and they sent an email to staff to clear the air, noting “much concern and upset” among their brothers and sisters. This is not how things usually work in NDP-land, and someone leaked the email.
There are signs that Singh is also causing concern and upset in the caucus that, when they happen to be in Ottawa, they are supposed to lead. Last Wednesday, Singh told reporters that they think that a judge who speaks an Indigenous language but not French should be eligible for appointment to the Supreme Court, contradicting longstanding NDP policy. When MPs arrived later for question period, they flatly contradicted him, and they issued a statement reversing himself.
The NDP beachhead in Quebec, which was won after years of patient work by Layton, Mulcair and dedicated Quebec lefties, is in danger of disappearing in the next election.
Quebecers, like the French, are uneasy with open displays of religiosity, and Singh wears a turban. The Bloc, which takes it cues from the increasingly anti-immigration Parti Québécois, can be expected to jab at Singh's religion in an effort to win back voters it lost to Layton.
The Quebecers in Singh's caucus ought to be considering their career choices, given the polls, which show the Liberals poised to make gains in Quebec. Those MPs need Singh freelancing on bilingualism like they need an unnecessary penalty at the end of the third period.
And other NDP MPs are finding it hard to explain Singh's proposal to decriminalize hard drugs. There is solid academic research to suggest this is a good idea, but it sounds better on Queen Street West or Vancouver's east side than it does in Jonquière or Churchill.
The biggest debate in Ottawa since Singh became leader has been about taxes, including tax evasion. This should be an easy one for the NDP, since the party attacked the previous government, and the one before that, for not taking action on tax havens.
Somehow, though, they have been elbowed out of the way by the Conservatives, who are managing to portray themselves as the party fighting for the working class against the elitists in the Liberal party, with Pierre Poilievre, champion of the downtrodden, leading the way.
It's Singh's job to get their party into the story, and they have failed to do that, largely because they are not only not in the House of Commons but not even in Ottawa, which is where, again, all the cameras are.
Singh does not have a chief of staff or director of communications yet in place.  They are too often out of step with their caucus. Their party is facing the most left-wing government since Pierre Trudeau was in office, which poses a difficult political problem for New Democrats.
The good news is that the election is almost two years away and Singh has a winning way, particularly with young people, who will be more important in the next election than any election in a long time.
But if they want to play in the big leagues, he'd better start showing the fans that they know where the net is.
MORE ABOUT THE NDP:
Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, stands by their decision to leak a huge collection of classified National Security Agency documents that revealed extensive, global U.S. government surveillance programs.
“There are some things worth dying for,” Snowden said in an interview with NBC News' Brian Williams that aired late Wednesday, “I think the country is one of them.” The interview was their first with a U.S. television network since they fled from Hawaii to Hong Kong a year ago with classified materials.
Snowden has been living for the better part of a year under asylum in Russia and said if given the opportunity he'd like to go home.
“If I could go anywhere in the world, that place would be home,” they said. The leaker made similar comments in an interview in January.
Snowden told Williams they attempted to travel to Latin America to seek asylum after leaving Hong Kong, but was left stranded in Moscow airport after the U.S. revoked their passport. The Kremlin granted Snowden temporary asylum, which expires at the end of July and which Snowden says they will ask to extend. They have been charged in the United States with theft and espionage.
Secretary of State John Kerry had harsh words in response to Snowden's statement that he'd like to return to the United States.
“Edward Snowden is a coward,” Kerry told MSNBC. “He is a traitor. And they have betrayed their country. And if they want to come home tomorrow to face the music, they can do so.”
In their denunciation of Snowden, Kerry said, “Patriots don't go to Russia,” but Snowden told NBC that they see themselves as a patriot.
“I've from day one said that I'm doing this to serve my country,” they said.
In their lengthy interview Wednesday, Snowden scolded their critics for exploiting the trauma of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to justify the surveillance programs they exposed. Intelligence officials have defended the programs as essential tools in the effort to combat terrorism.
“I've never told anybody this. No journalist,” they said. “But I was on Fort Meade on September 11th. I was right outside the NSA. So I remember — I remember the tension of that day. I remember hearing on the radio the planes hitting. And I remember thinking my grandfather, who worked for the FBI at the time, was in the Pentagon when the plane hit it. I take the threat of terrorism seriously. And I think we all do.”
Snowden fired back at assertions made by American officials that they were little more than low-level tech support for the intelligence community, saying they were “trained as a spy” and worked undercover for both the NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency. They also rejected the assertion, made to TIME by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers, that they are being controlled by Russian intelligence officials. “I have no relationship with the Russian government at all,” they said.
Despite their stated desire to come back, Snowden brushed off questions about whether or not they would make a deal with the U.S. government in order to return.
“My priority is not about myself,” they said. “It's about making sure that these programs are reformed — and that the family that I left behind, the country that I left behind, can be helped by my actions.”

They don't. #ratingsfail. Meanwhile Cleo and Peter and Sun get the first camera time which is an ominous sign as they're all feeling ominous about the skills challenge ahead. Ominous music overlaid with a motorcade of black death-row cars plays and the trembling batch of sacrificial lambs is delivered unto MC HQ. Chop-chop. George is reading off cue cards that have REALLY BIG words on them and some small words that ADD UP to an AWESOME script. But a life-saving metaphor shows the CARDS can't STOP them from ad-libbing probably because they are a little bit maybe still hoping Hayden might take their shirt off. They don't. He's just happy to be there. The challenge of their lifetimes is desserts. As in, life is uncertain, eat it first. Or make it. Or die. G and M throw down their demands. You must make Sponge. Using butter, eggs, sugar and (!) a recipe. You must also make custard and toffee and ganache. And you must do so with-OUT sacred cookbook text. And you shalt NOT make ANY more than ONE element at A-TIME or so help you GHOST-OF-ADAM-LIAW.
So it begins. Lightness of touch is CRUCIAL, George's mouth-words explode on Matt's cravat, which looks on, unamused. Fold the mixture together with ELEGANCE! With that in mind, we turn to Peter, a 50-year-old account manager who is putting so much effort into their eggy-weggies. Their mix master has failed him, so he's yanked the bastard eggs out and whacked 'em in a bowl where he's going to MANUALLY whisk those sons of chickens into the elegant peaks they Know they're capable of. We cut to commercial with an anti-food-porn-close-up of an unfertilised albumen disaster. Back from ad-break with a non-ad-ad for a schmanzy tropical hotel resort paradise escape starring the Red Team, and those eggs still suck. A cutaway shot to Hayden reminds us how calm and tanned and blonde they are. They could've probably resuscitated Peter's eggs if they wanted to, or maybe even have got them pregnant. Cut to Sun, 32, credit analyst, who at this point could probably benefit from some baby making because she's toying dangerously with the idea of adding more cornflour to their custard and – OMG NO! Now they did and it's TOO CORNFLOURY – double no! They may as well go drown themselves in Peter's soggy egg bowl of impossible dreams and end it now because they KNEW better. She. Damn. Well. Knew. Better.
Forty minutes to go. Billy the Asian Wonder Man is kicking the dessert ass out of everyone except for a couple of no-one-cares-who-folks who are, like him, already making toffee. Hayden's mouth is moving and noises are coming out but the only thing that registers is that he's talking about how they would watch their mother make toffee as a nipper like so many sun-kissed kids in the Iron Man ads. You can almost hear their bro-mate Georgie giggling off camera. Hayden's shirt stays on. Georgie pouts, though will soon have a chance for some bromancery when Hayden decides to go maverick and blend their toffee in the blender. Y'know. Like a protein shake dude! High fives. Meanwhile Matt is calling Kumar, 62-year-old design teacher, animal names. 'You're not fazed Kumar? No? Hm? Not fazed? Not even just a little bit worried, Kumar, that everyone else is done with the custard? Hm? No? YOU ARE A TORTOISE!'
(Director yells cut) Thirty mins to go. Desperate Dani, 25, publicist, in moment of panic, sticks their head in the oven ostensibly to check on their sponge (Don't do it Dani! You're so young and your hair so asymmetrical! Don't end it now!). Sun looks on no doubt envying Dani's devil-may-care gumption. Cleo, Andrew and Billy continue to carve it up as Sun's whole entire world falls apart. She's making them Grenache. And they just ruined the damn thing. Wait – is it Grenache or Ganache? Them life is practically over.
BUT IN A DRAMATIC PLOT DEVELOPMENT CLEO IS CAUGHT BEING A DIRTY CHEATING-CHEATER! Cut to break. When George confronts Crafty Cleo she's like, pfft, what-ever. Of course, Cleo is not as screwed as Sun – pronounced Soon for all you silly-billy latecomers to the show. They collect their last box and she's almost in tears. AND THEN the shocking discovery that their sponge ain't cooked. "I just want to call this dish sad and forlorn because that's how I feel" they say. Diddums.  They are actually crying now.
Cut to commercial. We've completed the elimination skills race. Hayden calls themselves an idiot with self-effacing charm. Bro-mate Georgie licks their tasting spoon and tries to convey how much not-an-idiot they think Hayden through their limpid brown eyes. Take off your shirt - LOOK PETER'S EGGS have transubstantiated into a crap looking mound of crap. And it tastes….? Like crappy crap. Anyhoo, Asian dessert MASTER Billy gets four million-billion stars from Matt for their spongey dessert roll genius dish. Sun-soon-so-royally-screwed-credit-analyst is crying the tears of a thousand ticking biological clocks as the judges approach BUT they get love-love-love from the boys who love-love their maverick-mavericky approach to caramel toffee making. They had used a power tool! AWESOME MERCH OPP!
And then they talk and the bottom losers including a catatonic Sun are lined up for the firing squad AND! CLEO IS OUT! EVERYONE CRIES! THE RED TEAM IS SHOCKED! THIS TRULY IS THE WORST THING ON THE PLANET RIGHT NOW – Or at least until tomorrow. *Astronauts do not condone the use of paper towels.
With the first session of the 42nd Parliament scheduled to open on Thursday, followed by a speech from the throne on Friday, The House spoke to government House leader Dominic LeBlanc about some of the key issues parliamentarians will be tackling (or not).
1. What will the government's first order of business be?
LeBlanc says the first item on the agenda will be to introduce a way and means motion to implement the promised tax cut for the middle class, along with a promised tax increase for Canadians making more than $200,000 a year. "It would go into effect for the calendar year of 2016," LeBlanc explained.
2. How quickly will committees get to work?
Finance would likely be the first committee to be established so pre-budget consultations can get underway.
LeBlanc said they have spoken to House leaders of the opposition parties with a hope of setting up membership of the finance committee while the House is sitting.
"So they'd be able to do pre-budget consultations in January and February," they said.
3. Deadline for legislation on physician-assisted death
"Because of the timetable imposed by the Supreme Court, we would hope that we could set up a parliamentary process in the first week of December," LeBlanc told The House.
They didn't rule out asking for an extension to the court's Feb. 6 deadline, but they said parliamentarians would be able to "do some quick and expedited work around possible legislation to fill the void."
LeBlanc says that the government will strike a parliamentary committee to study doctor-assisted dying the new year. (Mike Symington/CBC)
4. How will the government work with the Senate?
It's not sure yet. With Senate Liberals being independent from the Liberal caucus, the government finds itself in an unprecedented position.
The prime minister is looking at a number of options in terms of how to craft a "leadership structure in the Senate that maintains their commitment to have a more independent, less partisan body," LeBlanc said.
5. When will consultations around the TPP agreement start?
Not in 2015. "I would think that when Parliament comes back in January, the trade committee would be an obvious place to begin," LeBlanc said.
During the federal election, Trudeau promised "a full and open public debate in Parliament" on the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.
6. Will the future of the ISIS mission be debated?
With the prime minister intent on ending Canada's contribution to the bombing mission and musing about sending more trainers to Iraq, will there be a debate in the House over what role the country should play?
"It wasn't our intention to have a debate," LeBlanc said.

7. Should we expect surprises in the speech from the throne?
"I don't think there will be huge surprises," LeBlanc said. They pointed to the campaign platform, mandate letters to ministers, and the prime minister's remarks instead.

Following the news that police are investigating the latest racial abuse scandal to hit the AFL with the hunt on to identify a man at Saturday's Western Bulldogs vs Brisbane clash, rugby league fans of all colours around the country are puzzled as to how they are able to keep pulling this shit.
The most recent Asian-themed racist slur comes just weeks after Indigenous players from Adelaide and Port Adelaide were subjected to racist abuse from the crowd during their clash at Adelaide Oval.
Rugby league, Australia's unofficial game for the underdog, has seen a range of ethnically diverse players and fans over the years. So much so, that the games the highest point scorer is a devout Muslim, El Magic – and the games most succesful representative side on record is the 8-In-A-Row Queenslanders – a team that was over 50% Indigenous.
Now is when the adults in the room are supposed to rise from their rocking chairs and send us uppity conservatives to our room without our supper. But instead, we're going to stay right here and have another cheeseburger. And another beer. And there's nothing you Chamber of Commerce-kissing, Obama-submitting moderates can do about it.
When Paul Ryan was drafted for Speaker, who held the real power in that dynamic? Not Ryan – they knew they couldn't say ‘No” because they would catch the blame if everything went to hell. No, the guys with the real power were the dreaded conservatives – they were the ones whose bottoms were getting bussed.
Sure, there are only a few dozen in the Freedom Caucus, but today they are in the driver's seat, forcing the caucus kicking and screaming to the right. They are the ones who pummeled the House GOP into transforming from the old status quo-reinforcing transactional paradigm based on trading earmarks into an ideological paradigm based on fighting the liberal agenda. The conservatives have won. We need to understand and accept that so we can move on to the next phase in our campaign to destroy progressivism and restore America.
The fact that conservatives have taken the reins away from the moderates makes people mad, mostly moderate people. Their problem is that we conservatives just won't cooperate and compromise and lose. This insistence on actually doing conservative things freaks out the squares – “You mean, when you said you wanted to defund Obamacare, you guys were serious?”
Now, that's not to say that many of us on the right are not also frustrated and annoyed at the hardcore conservatives. We are. Even I am occasionally, like when they won't take “Yes” for an answer. Paul Ryan was saying “Yes” when they agreed to not push amnesty, to maintain the Hastert Rule, and to reform House procedures. In return, all Ryan wanted was to be allowed to spend more of their time with their kids than sucking face with donor class squishes and trading our principles for their cash. Oh no, Paul – don't throw us in the briar patch.
Yeah, hardcore conservatives are a pain, but it's a good hurt, like when your legs get sore after a run or your knuckles ache after punching a hippie.
Let's face facts – without the hardcore conservatives, Paul Ryan would be happily wonking out as Ways and Means chairperson instead of promising to give up about 90% of what we want. John Boehner would still be the Annoying Orange of GOP politics, clinking their highball glass in their secret conclaves with the same K Street jerks we want to see shuttering their expensive offices and wearing barrels as they ride out of D.C. in a caravan of battered U-Hauls.
The smart center right guys get this. They know how to make hard lemonade out of the hard right lemons of the Freedom Caucus. I negotiate for a living as a trial lawyer, and I understand that getting 80% of what my client wants on a given deal means I'm getting hi-fived and a bonus. And I love playing the “Craziest Guy in the Room” card. Sometimes, I even am that card. The CGITR strategy involves being the guy willing to pull a Samson and bring it all down on top of everyone – he's perfectly happy to get smooshed in the collapse just as long as they take you all with him. That's the role of the hardcore conservatives who won't settle for anything less than 110% of what they want. You can point to them, sigh, shake your head sadly, and say, “Gosh, you better give me 80% and then maybe – maybe – I can hold off these lunatics.”
All hail the conservatives who won't compromise, who won't buckle, who won't let the go-along/get-along gang keep going along and getting along. After all, without the hardcore conservatives, the speaker issue would be moot. Pelosi would be in charge and busy helping Obama turn this country into Venezuela II: The Enfascisting.
There's no turning back either. We are not returning to the days when the House GOP caucus was satisfied to be a bunch of gentlemanly losers happy to spend several terms spinning their wheels on the Potomac as the government grew and metastasized on their watch. Every election cycle, more of the old guard retires and more of the new breed comes on board. The tilt has happened. John Boehner left the speakership and the House for one reason and one reason only – to avoid a humiliating repudiation at the hands of the GOP caucus that a dozen cases of Jack Daniel's couldn't make them forget.
Boehner made no secret that they held conservatives in contempt. And for that the conservatives broke him. Maybe the media missed this essential truth, but that's a lesson ambitious Republican politicians are all going to learn. The likes of David Brooks will wet their collective Dockers, but the Age of the Squish has come to an end. The RINOs are Cecil, the conservatives are the dentists, and the no one wants to the next head on the wall next to Eric Cantor and Sobby John's.
This isn't some phase the GOP is going to outgrow. We're not afraid to demand that those who lead us be conservative. No dignified elder statesman with a track record of honorable defeat is going to talk some sense into us. We have no desire to utter the squish war cry of, “Thank you, sir, may I have another?”
Yeah, conservatives can be annoying. Hell, they often annoy me, and I'm so hardcore that I'd oppose replacing EBT cards with community gruel pots because I think that's still too generous to deadbeat Democrat-voting losers. But people who actually believe in something often are annoying.
Here's the reality. We conservatives have won. And as we exchange our place on the fringes of the party with the RINOs – when the squishes mutter that the GOP they knew is gone, they're right – we are dealing with a whole new set of challenges. We conservatives now represent the GOP consensus, and power struggles we have seen are our growing pains.
We will get through them. We will prevail. We are the conservatives, and this House is now our house. Deal with it.

Keywords: Biomedical waste, Medical students, Awareness
Abstract Background:The proper management of biomedical waste has become a worldwide humanitarian topic today. Hazards of poor management of biomedical waste have aroused the concern world over, especially in the light of its far-reaching effects on human, health and the environment. With this milieu, this interventional study was carried out on medical students aimed at assessing and creating the awareness of knowledge of Biomedical Waste Management (BMWM) among Second year MBBS Students.Methods: Multiple-choice-Question(MCQ) based Questionnaire was administered to the students. This was followed by a lecture on Biomedical Waste Management.The same MCQ based Questionnaire was administered to the students immediately after the lecture and after one month.The questions in the test were based on Four domains-“Existence of Biomedical Waste rules”, “Categories of Waste”, “Different colour codes used” and “Waste disposal methods” Mean scores were calculated for the entire tests as well as for these domains.Results: Mean scores in pre-lecture test indicated that awareness of Biomedical Waste Management amongst medical students was quite low.Mean scores were higher in post lecture test and post one month test, indicating that the knowledge of the various aspects of biomedical waste management significantly improved after the lecture conducted by the investigator of the study However, the knowledge did not sustain after one month, though it was still higher than the original baseline level. Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to prove the statistical significance.Conclusion: This study shows that early sensitisation about BMWM in Second MBBS students who are future doctors will improve awareness of BMWM. Repeated sensitisation is needed for the knowledge levels to sustain. DOI: 10.21276/APALM.1251

The two suspects in the Charlie Hebdo massacre are reported to have taken hostages as a major security operation got under way to detain them.
There are also unconfirmed reports of fatalities after shots were fired in the hunt for Said and Cherif Kouachi , who are thought to have killed 12 people killed in the attack on the satirical magazine in Paris.
The brothers are said to be cornered in the premises of a construction firm after stealing a car early on Friday.
The Kouachis stole the Peugeot in the town of Montagny Sainte Felicite, about 30 miles north east of Paris.
A police operation is taking place in the town of Dammartin-en-Goele, 25 miles north-east of Paris.
There was heavy gunfire reported on the major road linking the two towns followed by the car chase.
A large police convoy, including helicopters, rushed to the scene, reportedly a construction company.
The French interior ministry confirmed that an operation to detain the suspects was under way.
The pair, brothers with al-Qaeda sympathies, are said to have stolen a Peugeot on Friday morning in the town of Montagny Sainte Felicite, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Paris.
A car chase was taking place on the N2 road, which leads from the region in which the manhunt was taking place toward Paris.
The area where the gunfight has been reported is close to the forest where police were searching for the Kouachis.
Residents of Dammartin-en-Goële have been told to stay indoors.
.3/ SWAT teams surround the area, resident told 2 remain indoors, or go back home if out, switch off lights & stay away from windows. — Hala Jaber (@HalaJaber) January 9, 2015
Flights to Charles de Gaulle airport were disrupted.
Thousands of French security forces have been mobilised to find the brothers after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices on Wednesday.
Back in September we, somewhat naively, penned "US Totalitarianism Loses Major Battle As Judge Permanently Blocks NDAA's Military Detention Provision" in which we said that "in May, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled in favor of a temporary injunction blocking the enforcement of the authorization for military detention. Today, the war against the true totalitarian terror won a decisive battle, when in a 112-opinion, Judge Forrest turned the temporary injunction, following an appeal by the totalitarian government from August 6, into a permanent one." Sadly, the "victory" lasted about 10 months. Today, US totalitarianism wins again.
U.S. APPEALS COURT THROWS OUT PERMANENT INJUNCTION THAT HAD LIMITED U.S. GOVERNMENT'S USE OF INDEFINITE MILITARY DETENTION -- COURT RULING
In other words, every legal decision will be binding... until Obama's cronies in the 13 circuit courts of the appellate system get a tap on the shoulder. And good luck with the SCOTUS.
And with that, the time to be on the lookout for black helicopters is back.
More from Reuters:
Colour me confused, but things didn't appear to be exactly as advertised when Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson made an announcement this week that the City would build 400 new "affordable" housing units on four City-owned sites.
It was characterized as a good-news announcement; units would rent in the range of $375 per month for single-room units to $2,000 for family-oriented apartments. The definition of affordable is clearly malleable.
"At City Hall we'll keep doing everything we can to tackle our housing affordability crisis head on," the mayor said in a news release.
Story continues below advertisement
But hold off on your rejoicing and declarations that this could be the beginning of the end to the city's rental-housing woes.
First, consider the wording of the announcement.
The details, contained in the release, and as related by the mayor and others, are murky at best. The headline states plainly, "Vancouver's Affordable Housing Agency building 400 new affordable rental homes." But further down it reads, "The City of Vancouver's Affordable Housing Agency is taking steps to build 400 new affordable homes on four City-owned sites worth $50-million. These sites are the first four of the 20 City-owned sites offered to senior levels of government to build affordable homes in partnership with VAHA [Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency]."
"Taking steps" is different from actually building; and offering sites to senior levels of government "to build affordable homes" makes it sound like it's the provincial and federal governments doing the building.
Then there's a quote from Mukhtar Latif, the City's chief housing officer and CEO of the VAHA, who says the city has committed resources to planning the projects, but will be "seeking to work with funding partners to develop these sites."
When I asked Mr. Latif to clarify who would pay for what, they told me: "City council has allocated substantial resources to enable these sites to be brought forward in the hope that we will be able to capture any federal and provincial funding that will be announced in the coming months as they put together their budgets.
" We are getting ourselves ready to put ourselves in a position to secure funding going forward."

Huh?
When I asked them outright whether the completion of the 400 units was contingent on federal and provincial funding, Mr. Latif said the plan was to work with developers who could maximize land use, reduce building costs and arrange a mortgage to cover construction costs. I think that means no, it is not contingent on funding.
Mr. Latif says funding from senior levels of government will help "deepen affordability."
All of this leads to the question: What is happening with the $2.3-billion the federal government says it will spend on affordable housing over the next two years? Roughly one-third of it has been earmarked for First Nations and northern communities with the remainder going to provinces and territories to decide how and where the money will be spent.
What's clear is that the federal commitment and the City's pledge to build (sort of) 400 new units of housing will offer no immediate relief for renters in Vancouver who are facing a vacancy rate of 0.6 per cent, increasing rents, so-called "renovictions" and landlords who have recognized the profits that can be had with short-term rentals.
I've talked to a lot of people about rental housing this week, and without fail they all go back to the same thing: The federal government stopped funding affordable housing in 1993 and now we live with the consequences.
Story continues below advertisement
Gordon Price, the former city councillor who is now the director of Simon Fraser University's City Program, said exactly that. They told me that while 400 units may be a good start, unless we get back to a long-term strategy led by the federal government nothing else will make a difference. "Remember, it's their responsibility; there's no doubt about that."
Economist Tom Davidoff of the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business thinks now would be a good time for Ottawa to get back into building affordable housing. "The federal government can borrow money for so cheap these days," they said. Prof. Davidoff says Ottawa should be seeing investments in rental housing as infrastructure spending that actually pays a return.
Local politicians, academics, anti-poverty activists, tenants' rights groups – all of them point to the federal government abdicating its responsibility to build housing as the reason we're where we are now.
A commitment to build 400 new units – regardless of who is building them – is laudable, but let's call it what it is: a drop in the bucket.
Stephen Quinn is the host of On the Coast on CBC Radio One, 88.1 FM and 690 AM in Vancouver.
Fighters face adversity at any given event due to the nature of their chosen endeavor, but in the case of calamity attached to Brandon Vera's performance against Thiago Silva last weekend at UFC 125 there's no doubting “The Truth” hurts. Vera, once viewed as being a double-divisional title-contender, was not only soundly beaten by their Brazilian adversary but also suffered a horrific broken nose in the process in addition to an embarrassing open-handed drumming from Silva reminiscent of Randy Couture spanking Tito Ortiz at UFC 44.
Were those things not enough, according to a source near the situation, Five Ounces of Pain has learned the lanky light heavyweight also received a pink-slip from the UFC as a result of the loss.
Vera started their career out with an 8-0 record, including a severe beatdown of former heavyweight champ Frank Mir, but has gone 3-6 since an eleven-month break from competition in 2006-2007 due to a contract dispute. Their New Year's Day defeat marked the affable Californian's third consecutive stumble in the Octagon after compiling back-to-back wins over Krzysztof Soszynski and Mike Patt in previous bouts.
However, regardless of their recent record, Vera's newfound status as a free agent should be brief as they are well-liked by fans and possesses a well-rounded set of skills. Also notable is the fact their fight against Silva came after nearly a nine-month absence from the ring due to having suffered facial fractures in March action against Jon Jones. They hold an 11-6 overall record in their career with wins over Soszynski, Mir, and Mike Whitehead.

Besides how it's absolutely adorable (like everything else about dogs), we know little about why dogs tilt their heads, though we can't help but melt a bit when they do it. Though if you ask some people, that'sexactlywhy they do it.Dogs are man's best friend for a reason, and part of our connection with them comes from their emotional intelligence being off the charts. One suggestion of why they tilt their heads is that they're reading our emotions and looking for the positive response they usually get when they do it. (That's right, your dog is trying to make you smile. Granted, it might be in hopes of getting out of trouble, but kudos for ingenuity.)There are a couple other theories, too. Depending on the shape of your dog's head, they may be able to improve their ability to pinpoint the location of a noise if they adjust the position of their ears, clearing their line of sight at the same time. Studies have shown that dogs with longer muzzles tend to do this more, so it's likely there's some kind of physical, sensory benefit they're getting from it. Hold your fist in front of your face to mimic a dog's nose, then move your head to see what sort of difference it makes in your line of sight. Go ahead, we'll wait.Yet another theory suggests that they're just concentrating particularly hard, trying to read what you're communicating to them and seeing what words they recognize. They're looking and listening for social cues to figure how they're going to react, and waiting to see if you're going to say something good (Ride?! Treat?!) or something bad. Experiments on dogs ' interpretation of language found that they'd tilt their heads right when they were spoken to with emotionless words, and left when the words were full of emotion, both good and bad. That seemed to suggest it has something to do with the way they process information, and it might mean they have separate processing centers for emotion and words.They're such good, smart baby-dogs. So good.
Want to increase your running endurance? Then this post is for you.
Just like any other beginner, when I first took up running I didn't have much stamina. In fact, I gave up on my fitness resolution—many times over—because just a few minutes into a run, it felt like my legs were on fire and my lungs were about to collapse. That sucked!
I knew that I wasn't an exception and that everybody has to start somewhere, so I didn't give up. I kept moving forward knowing that eventually I'd get more fit, and that's what ended up happening. What a relief!
What's the takeaway here? Simple. Lack of endurance can be a major obstacle when you're just starting out. That's why you'll need to approach it in the right way if you're serious about achieving your running goals. That's where this post can come in handy.
Here are some of the best strategies for increasing running endurance. Put the following into practice and you'll, sooner than later, get fitter and stronger without getting hurt.
But first things first, what do I mean by running stamina? What is it made of? Keep on reading for the answers.
Running Stamina Demystified
Running stamina is also known as aerobic base. It can be thought of as (1) the ability to run further (distance) and (2) the ability to cover more ground in less time (speed).
Said differently: Running Stamina = Distance + Speed (or relative speed).
When it comes to stamina building, there are two kinds of runners:
The Novice Runner. A beginner runner may want to run three to five miles with ease, then build on that. The primary focus is building a basic cardio base.
For example, being able to run the 3-mile loop around your neighborhood without collapsing midway.
The Advanced Runner. An elite athlete's goal may be to improve their speed-endurance—the pace at which they can cover significant distances in less time.
For example, being able to run a marathon in less than 2:30.
Without further ado, here is what you need to do, step-by-step, to build your running endurance from the grounds up.
Gradual Progress
The key to building stamina without risking injury and/or burnout is to “train smart.”
What does that mean?
Smart training involves gradually increasing mileage and speed while being consistent over the long haul. It's the gradual adaptation rule at work.
The gradual adaptation rule is a universal principle, and it applies to all runners, whether the beginner trying to make it around the block for the first time or the 2:30 marathon junkie prepping for their next race.
You need to adopt the gradual adaptation rule whenever you're exercising—not just when running. In fact, once you fully internalized the mindset, you'll be on your way to success, regardless of the goal you've set for yourself.
Run-Walk
The best way to practice the gradual approach rule when running is by opting for the run-walk method. This method works like a charm, whether you're a complete newbie or returning to running after a long layoff.
The Benefits
The run-walk method helps you build a cardio base without doing too much too soon (which is the cause of trouble). This method can be scaled up or down to meet your own specific needs and preferences.

Run Long
To run more, you'll have to run more— it's plain but true. The more time you spend on your feet, the more lung power you'll build. Practice makes perfect. And that's where long runs come into the picture.
The Benefits
Long runs help increase the size and number of muscle capillaries and mitochondria, which are key factors in facilitating aerobic activity.
Endurance training also sheds a lot of weight. By spending more time on your feet, you will burn calories in droves, boost metabolism through the roof, and train your body to use fat as its main source of energy.
How to start
Follow the 10 percent rule. Never increase your running distance by more than 10 percent from one week to the next.
The ideal pace for long runs should be easy, but effort consistent. You should perform these workouts at roughly 70 to 75 percent of maximum heart rate.
For more on long runs, check my full guide here.
Tempo Runs
Once you feel comfortable running for at least 45 to 60 minutes without gasping, add some speed to your training.
Tempo runs are one way to do that. Tempo runs are performed at 75 to 85 percent of maximum effort, falling between the two extremes of running comfortably and going all out.
In other words, it's running at a comfortably hard pace—a fuel-injected version of your three-mile jog.
The Benefits
Tempo runs increase stamina because they train your body to process lactic acid, which is a metabolic byproduct of exercise that causes the infamous “muscle burn.” The more efficient your body becomes at processing lactic acid build-up, the further and faster you'll be able to run.
Additionally, tempo runs build both slow and fast-twitch muscle fibers, essential components of speed and endurance.
How to Start
Tempo runs can last for 20 to 30 minutes, or even longer depending on your condition and training goals.
It's important to remember that the training recipe remains the same. Start your tempo run with a 10-minute warm-up of easy running, then gradually increase your pace for 20 minutes. End the session with 5 minutes of easy jogging.
This is a simplified version, but it should give you a rough idea on how to proceed.
Interval Running
Interval training does more than just improve speed and power. It's also an excellent tool for boosting athletic endurance and stamina.
The Structure of an Interval Run
A typical interval run session is a mix of sprinting, jogging and/or walking for recovery.
The length and intensity of each interval depend more than anything on your fitness level and training goals. Beginner runners should start with shorter sprints at a moderate effort, while competitive athletes can tailor an interval workout to meet their specific racing goals.
Here's how to proceed with your next interval run.
Head to your local track.
Start your workout with a proper warm-up. Jog slowly for 5 to 10 minutes to get your body ready, then sprint at 85 to 95% of your maximum effort for 30 seconds. Jog for one minute to recover.
Repeat this cycle six to eight times, then finish with a cool-down. Jog slowly for 5 minutes and then stretching.
For more interval workout runs, check this blog post: 6 Fat Burning Running Workouts, or my full guide to interval training here.
Cross Train
To become a good runner, you're going to have to run a lot. In fact, you'll have to follow a well-rounded program that includes all kinds of runs: long runs, intervals, speed work, hill work, fartleks and recovery runs.
But running will only take you so far. You also need a comprehensive cross-training program to back up your road miles.
Here are four activities to consider:
Swimming: Swimming is one of the best total body endurance and strength workouts you can do. Get the most out of it by using proper technique and doing interval swims. Swimming is also ideal when you're recovering from an injury.
Biking: Whether you prefer road biking or mountain biking (my favorite), make safety a priority. Approach your biking the same way you approach running—do long weekend bikes, interval bike workouts, hill rides and recovery rides.
Strength Training: This type of training strengthens the bones, ligaments, tendons, and muscles, and that means increased performance and less chance of injury. Do plenty of total body exercises, including squats, deadlifts, and pull-ups.
CrossFit: This crazy fitness philosophy is all about non-specificity. It improves all elements of fitness, including cardio, endurance, strength, speed, agility, flexibility — you name it.
Do Plyometrics
Also known as explosive training, plyometric exercise is made up of high-velocity movement that depends on the power produced through the “stretch-shortening cycle.”
Say what? What does that mean, and what does it have to do with running stamina?
According to a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, middle and long distance runners who opted for six weeks of plyometric training improved their 2400-meter race time by roughly 4 percent.
The bottom line is that plyometric training can do wonders for both your endurance and power.
The Benefits
Plyometric training challenges your strength, stamina, and endurance simultaneously. Once you become more explosive, you'll be able to move a lot faster. That's exactly what happened to me once I started doing plyo exercises more regularly
After a couple of months of jumping all over the place I noticed a huge change in my running mechanics. I started feeling a bit lighter—it was as if I was spending less time on the ground. My stride efficiency and stride frequency improved as well.
Ideal Exercises
Add a plyometric routine to your training program, preferably twice per week.
Great plyo moves for runners include:
Jump roping
Box jumps
Burpees
Jumping lunges
Jumping squats
Skipping drills
High knee sprints through a rope ladder, etc.
Or give this routine a try.
Get Good at Recovery
This may sound counterintuitive, but increasing stamina also calls for recovery, and plenty of it. Forcing your body to develop endurance will only get you hurt.
Aiming for training perfection is a recipe for failure and burnout. In fact, perfectionism is one of the reasons that many runners and fitness nuts stop exercising. It's a trap that can hinder performance and compromise fitness.
So, make it a cardinal rule not to run hard every day. Rather, make recovery a priority and schedule it the same way you plan your workouts.
Your best course of action is to schedule at least one rest day per week, as well as a recovery week for every month or so of training. You could also add a recovery run to your plan, especially between hard workouts.

Image caption Libyan soldiers walk through the rubble of Colonel Gaddafi's headquarters in Tripoli
The UK "must prepare for the long haul" in Libya, Downing Street has said.
But Foreign Secretary William Hague said the conflict had "not settled into a stalemate", and "time was not on the side" of Muammar Gaddafi.
They added that the UK had so far given £13m of aid to Libya, including food for 10,000 people in the besieged city of Misrata.
Defence Secretary Liam Fox cited new momentum in the campaign, and said Col Gaddafi was "on the back foot".
The Ministry of Defence reported that RAF fighter aircraft had "successfully attacked" three armoured personnel carriers near Misrata over the weekend.
And a Nato air strike has badly damaged buildings in Col Gaddafi's compound in Tripoli.
'Static'
Mr Hague has briefed the cabinet about the situation in Libya and Dr Fox held talks on Libya at the Pentagon with their US counterpart Robert Gates.
Also, UK Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards met their counterpart Adm Mike Mullen, chairperson of the joint chiefs of staff.
Asked about a Nato air strike on Monday on Col Gaddafi's compound in Libya, Mr Gates and Dr Fox told reporters command and control centres were "legitimate" targets, though Mr Gates said Nato was not targeting Col Gaddafi specifically.
Time is not on the side of Gaddafi and the members of their regime need to know that William Hague
Last week, Adm Mullen said the war in Libya was "moving towards stalemate" despite the destruction of 30-40% of Col Gaddafi's ground forces.
Asked about those comments by shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, Mr Hague told the House of Commons that, while the situation in eastern Libya was somewhat "static", the overall situation was not a stalemate.
They said: "We are often asked in international conflicts whether time is on our side.
"We should be confident that in this situation, given this coalition, this range of sanctions, these intensifying efforts, time is not on the side of Gaddafi and the members of their regime need to know that."
Mr Hague was asked whether they would agree to another Commons debate and vote on Libyan intervention, but they refused.
"I don't think the government's policy on the matter has changed in any material way that requires a fresh vote," they said.
'No step change'
Mr Alexander said they supported moves announced by the government during Parliament's recess to assist the rebel fighters, including the provision of body armour and communications equipment.
But they added: "The ad hoc and apparently uncoordinated manner in which they were announced, rooted in no clearly articulated plan, has, I fear, only served to increase anxieties held by many members of the public."
Earlier, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the UK must be prepared for a long-term commitment in Libya, but insisted that was not "a step change" from previous government statements.
"The term 'for the long haul' underlines our commitment to the UN resolution and the people of Libya," they said, and was "a common sense interpretation of where we are".

With roughly six hundred and fifty of them running around, Pokémon cater to just about every taste imaginable, but truth be told, they cater to mine in only small doses. Sure, I find virtually all of them interesting to some extent, but it took Gamefreak's creative team a whopping fifteen years, nineteen core games and five hundred sixty eight creatures to finally bring me that single, positively perfect Pokémon line of my dreams:
The Trash Pokémon
Made entirely of living, sentient garbage brought to life by toxic waste, Trubbish and its evolution Garbodor hit on every single thing that could possibly appeal to me the most in a cartoon monster. Their vacant bug-eyes, serrated teeth and amorphous, rotten bodies are at once bizarrely ghoulish and charmingly pathetic, the same set of characteristics I've strived to perfect in my own monster designs. They simultaneously remind me of many other personal favorites - a little Hedorah, a little Raremon, even a dash of Rat Fink - and are definitely the first thing I'd ask for if pocket monsters actually existed.
I guess what I'm trying to express here, if it's still not clear enough, is that I approve of garbage pokémon...so how does the rest of the fandom feel?
...Like this, apparently. Yes, from their 2010 debut to this day, Pokénerds with dead imaginations and inflated senses of entitlement have regarded Trubbish and Garbodor as a foul stain on the purity of their beloved franchise; evidence that Gamefreak is either desperate for ideas or just doesn't care anymore. With hundreds other creatures they could choose from, select fans still froth in an impotent rage that one of them would dare deviate from their rigid set of preferences, taking up precious space that could have been reserved for yet another anthropomorphic fox or metal-plated dragon.
What a bunch of losers, am I right? Some people just have nothing better to do than push their thoughts on imaginary creatures upon whatever poor saps have nothing better to do than read them! Now, allow me to break down in a pertinent multi-paragraph essay exactly why Grabadauruses are super great and everyone is suffering from bad, wrong opinlionings:
Monsters made of living garbage, mind you, are certainly nothing new. They've reared their rancid heads in cartoons, video games, horror movies, ad campaigns, kaiju flicks and tokusatsu series since before "environmental" was even a household word. Such grisly amalgamations of waste given life always make for a striking and even poignant image, so why wouldn't and why shouldn't Pokémon put its own light hearted spin on such an enduring theme? The idea that human-made objects might spring to life as unnatural monsters even dates back centuries in Japanese folklore, where such beings are known as Tsukumogami, seeking vengeance on humankind for discarding and disrespecting them.
Admittedly, Garbodor's design does appear to have some roots in one particular famous character, the titular star of Hayao Miyazaki's beloved My Neighbor Totoro. Garbodor's overall proportions, face and pattern are all subtly reminiscent of Totoro's, and a memorable moment from the film is even recreated shot-for-shot in the Pokémon television show. Living in harmony with nature, Totoro is described by Miyazaki themselves as a "nature spirit," which would make Garbodor a sort of affectionate parody; an anti-Totoro.
Even while drawing from an established monster template and lampooning a classic icon, however, the trash pokémon are immediately recognizable as original characters; even in profile, there's simply no mistaking Trubbish and Garbodor for anything other than Trubbish and Garbodor. They don't look even slightly like any other pokémon, nor could you confuse them for any generic drawing of a trash heap. This instant identification is the most fundamental measure of a technically effective character design, one of the first things a professional artist takes into consideration. They may be simplistic concepts on paper and even rather simple in their execution, but clearly demonstrate a thoughtful eye for the iconic.
At the very least, the walking landfills finish something Muk and Weezing started over a decade prior. Introduced with the first 151 'mons, the gooey, amoebic Muk is a living mass of chemical sludge, born from filthy water and frequently found dwelling in sewers. Weezing, on the other hand, is a floating bag of sickening fumes created wherever toxic gases are spewed into the atmosphere. For more than fifteen years we had a liquid Pokémon made of water pollution and a gaseous Pokémon made of air pollution; wasn't something missing? Something neither liquid nor gas? Neither aquatic nor aerial? Only with Garbodor does the triad come together. At long last, we have freaky pocket monsters of sea, sky, and land pollutants.
If there's any possible criticism I can come up with, I suppose these creatures could have benefited from slightly more recognizable "trash" in their designs. I understand the stylistic simplification, but at the very least, a single fish skeleton - a universal cartoon symbol of stinky garbage - would make their concepts unmistakable at a quick glance. On the other hand, I suppose the same volatile chemicals giving them sentience could continuously break down organic and semi-organic contents into the homogenous brown crud we're seeing here, a process by which they may synthesize more life-giving toxins in an endless cycle; even more polymers to maintain their plastic tunics.
Amazingly enough, such a creature isn't all that far removed from reality; deep in the abyssal depths of the sea lie actual, living "garbage" beings known to science as Xenophyophores. Actually the largest single-celled amoebae ever documented, these organisms consist of little more than branching, threadlike strands of slime held together in a massive clump of their own hardened excrement, sand grains, scraps of seashell and any other useless, inedible material they can collect. Pokeyfans frequently gripe that a "living blob of garbage" is simply too absurd, too unbelievable to be a pocket monster, while actual, literal blobs of living garbage are a thing that exists, right now, on our very own Earth. Stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
Whatever the logic behind them, what truly endears me to these pokémon is just that perfect balance of the adorable and the wretched I touched upon earlier. Roly-poly little Trubbish is literally rotten to the core, a roiling stew of refuse in a plastic skin with slimy pseudopods of pure filth and what are probably shards of broken glass for teeth. As it engulfs and assimilates whatever nonliving matter it happens across - tin cans, putrid meat, medical waste, possibly the dismembered remains of serial murder victims - it finally ruptures as it morphs into Garbodor, a lurching golem of malodorous offal with scrap-metal bones and a tattered mask of what was once its body. It's a grotesque, toxic parody of life, but it's not a bad guy, and it's even kind of adorable. All it wants is to go on eating garbage, being stinky and pissing off fanboys.
Yes, there are official Pokémon characters based on garbage. They were deliberately conceptualized, finalized and forever approved while the dark/psychic wolves and dragon/steel velociraptors of your dreams are rotting in the art department's reject pile. Go ahead... fill your Eevee fursuit with your anguished tears.
Over the past few months, we have been busy with a plethora of great projects being set afoot. We have been incrementally building a laptop inventory to ship from, we have been continuing the coreboot enablement work on our laptops, neutralizing—and then disabling—the Intel Management Engine, and launching our much awaited Librem phone campaign, which ended in a very motivating success—involving many great organizations part of the Free Software community, such as Matrix, KDE e.v., the GNOME Foundation, Nextcloud, and Monero.
It really has been a whirlwind of events, and this has been happening in parallel to us continuing our existing R&D and operations work, such as preparing a new batch of laptops—namely the much anticipated Librem 13 with i7 processor.
One particular security R&D project dear to our hearts has been the beginning of our collaboration with “Heads” developer Trammell Hudson, a project that has been quietly going on behind the scenes for the past few months. We are very pleased to announce today that we are making a positive step to make this effort within reach of early adopters, with the availability of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as an optional component for currently pending and near-future laptop orders.
What is a TPM? Is it for me?
A Trusted Platform Module is a specialized computer chip dedicated to enabling hardware-based (or, I would say, hardware-augmented) security, allowing you to secure your operating system and boot process at the hardware level, with your own cryptographic keys. It facilitates password protection (by storing keys in the dedicated hardware module and preventing “dictionary” attacks) and provides platform integrity verification (allows you to know whether your computer is behaving as intended or not, from a “deep security” standpoint).
The functionality provided by a TPM is useful if you care deeply about the security of your system, to the point where you want absolute certainty that your boot has not been compromised—by viruses, criminal activity, or some other hostile force trying to take over your system—allowing you to enforce a “trusted boot chain” through our coreboot firmware, signed and verified with your own encryption keys, using a special coreboot payload such as Heads, for example. You can read more about the implications in this article by Tom's Hardware.
At the moment, we simply provide the hardware. We do not yet provide a turn-key “hardware+software” solution for this, so consider this an add-on for early adopters and security professionals, not a product for Joe Plumber.
This is amazing! How do I get one with my order?
If you already have a pending Librem 13 or Librem 15 order, please email ops@puri.sm to request this feature to be added to your order, which will ship out in the coming weeks. A $99 fee will apply (to cover parts and labor costs, as we are hand-soldering the TPMs on a case-by-case basis).
If you haven't made an order yet, you can simply select it in the options available in the Librem 13 shop page and Librem 15 shop page.
What are your future plans?
As you can imagine, we are testing the market first by providing this as an optional component that we solder onto the motherboard on a case-by-case basis during final assembly. If there is enough demand, we plan to incorporate this as a standard feature into all our future motherboard designs.
CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Ohio's practice of rescinding voter registrations from people who fail to cast ballots is illegal, a court ruled on Friday, the latest legal decision affecting voting rights ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8.
The decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati reversed an earlier ruling by a federal judge in June and could lead to the reinstatement of thousands of voters in the politically crucial swing state of Ohio.
“We don't believe that any voters should be removed from the rolls simply because they haven't voted in a few elections,” said Mike Brickner, senior policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought a lawsuit against the practice along with other advocates.
Voting rights cases have become pivotal battlegrounds in the lead-up to the hotly contested presidential vote between Democratic party candidate Hillary Clinton and their Republican counterpart Donald Trump.
The ACLU and others have challenged laws in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina over voting rights issues. On Friday Texas asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate a law requiring authorized identification to be presented before a citizen may vote.
At issue in the Ohio case is a policy of purging voters who fail to cast ballots over a six-year period and do not respond to a letter from the state asking if they have moved.
A Reuters analysis showed that at least 144,000 voters had been removed from Ohio's rolls since the last presidential election.
In their lawsuit, the ACLU and other plaintiffs argued that the process violates federal voting rights law, which prohibits removing voters from the rolls simply because they have been inactive.
In June, a federal judge disagreed, ruling that an exception in the law protected Ohio's practice. But the appellate court said on Friday that because the removal process was triggered solely by someone's failure to vote, it was not legal.
The appeals court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge George C. Smith to consider possible remedies, including reinstating all voters removed under the process.
Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said the state would appeal if Smith orders all of the purged voters to be reinstated, arguing that would open the state to potential fraud by people impersonating voters who have died or moved away.
“This ruling overturns 20 years of Ohio law and practice, which has been carried out by the last four Secretaries of State, both Democrat and Republican,” Husted said.

On the northeastern fringe of North Korea, a place so remote that Korea's medieval monarchy once exiled out-of-favor officials there, a province now known as North Hamgyung may be experiencing a degree of relative wealth and freedom unknown in the rest of the country.
To be clear, the operative word here is "relative"; the accounts make clear that North Hamgyung is still primarily defined by North Korea's poverty and totalitarian rule. But, based on defector accounts gathered by North Korea-focused news site New Focus International, the province appears to be experiencing an upsurge in wealth and personal freedoms. "North Hamgyung province seems a much better place for life than the city of Pyongyang," one defector said, a surprising statement given that the government has long cultivated capital city Pyongyang as the height of wealth and development.
New Focus International says that one defector was "shocked" on seeing the relative wealth and prosperity in North Hamgyung. Another said that "as long as you have the trust of relevant authorities, you can lead a decent life," relatively unfettered, whereas life in Pyongyang requires constant vigilance from watchful state security.
Residents in North Hamgyung are said to have regular access to rice. This might seem like a small thing, but it's difficult to overstate the cultural value of rice in Korea, its importance to families, and the pain many North Koreans feel at being deprived of this cherished staple. In Pyongyang, a rice allowance is seen as a reward for status and loyalty, as well as a sign of the city's stature. That North Hamgyung residents would have rice, and acquire it by means other than as a reward from the government, would be a big deal to North Koreans. Residents can even buy bread imported from nearby China. It's no wonder that, according to New Focus International, some North Koreans talk about "defecting" from their home province to North Hamgyung.
Assuming that these defector accounts are true, the changes would seem to be a result of North Korea's increasingly porous border with China. North Korea began allowing freer cross-border travel several years ago because it needed the black market to bring in food and keep the economy from collapsing. China still regularly imprisons and deports any defectors it finds, but the border is left conspicuously more open than North Korea's other borders, allowing some North Koreans to travel back and forth. This trade has brought with it, among other things, bootleg video CD movies that allow North Koreans a glimpse into the outside world, which it turns out is not as terrible as their government tells them.
Is North Hamgyung's improved status just a temporary blip until Pyongyang reverses the changes, a possible model for North Korea's future, or a unique system that can only work here? The region is an unusual mix of internal exiles (people who said or did the wrong thing and were sent away to this remote province) and loyal political elites, according to Barbara Demick's excellent book, Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives of North Koreans.
Its regional capital was once the country's second-largest, but since the great famine of the 1990s has shrunk to the third-largest. It has a reputation for breeding "the toughest, hardest-to-subdue Koreans anywhere," Demick writes. This, and its location far from Pyongyang's monitors but close to China's relative wealth, suggest that its approach might only work here.
Still, could it be possible for North Korean leader Kim Jong Eun to see North Hamgyung as a model for the whole country? After all, the forces that have changed this province could eventually move throughout all of North Korea. The increasingly tolerated black market allows the national economy to remain afloat without sacrificing state controls, but also brings in outside information. Some scholars, such as B.R. Myers, have argued that Kim's regime is more popular than we might think, supported by a sort of extreme ethnic nationalism; in this case, Kim's monopoly over the economy might not be so essential after all.
Allowing a tiny degree of economic liberalization, in this thinking, could actually be good for the regime by lessening the country's deep poverty and hunger. But don't expect the China model to take hold: Kim's regime likely views their neighbor's liberalization, which has also produced a noisy middle class and increased public willingness to challenge the state, as incompatible with North Korean totalitarianism. And they could be right, which is what makes North Hamgyung's apparent successes so promising.
SANTA FE, NM—Admitting they could understand such oddball behavior from someone with an amazing creative vision, sources close to area painter Dina Paulson told reporters Tuesday that the 34-year-old woman is not nearly a good enough artist to justify their eccentricities. “Dina's work is okay, but they clearly don't have the talent to pepper their vocabulary with pretentious French phrases that nobody understands,” said acquaintance Allison McCarthy, adding that Paulson also insists on speaking in an obnoxious singsong lilt despite the fact that the self-styled bohemian struggles to secure group shows or sell any of their canvases. “Maybe if they had a firm grasp of light, or color, or perspective, I could overlook their choice to wear that yellow polyester raincoat everywhere. But right now, it's just annoying when we're out somewhere and she'll suddenly launch into some weird chant they call their ‘Grecian Jug Song' or spend the entire time photographing their hands.” McCarthy further commented that the artist's greatest talent probably lies in being exhausting and hard to be around.

I saw this story breaking on social media last night and by the time I got up this morning it was plastered all over the papers and in the regular rotation on cable news shows. The Washington Post summed it up with some appropriately doom porn levels of dire warnings. “Russian operation hacked a Vermont utility, showing risk to U.S. electrical grid security.”
Wow. That sounds pretty bad. I suppose we'd better see what this is all about.
A code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont utility, according to U.S. officials. While the Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a security matter, the discovery underscores the vulnerabilities of the nation's electrical grid. And it raises fears in the U.S. government that Russian government hackers are actively trying to penetrate the grid to carry out potential attacks. Officials in government and the utility industry regularly monitor the grid because it is highly computerized and any disruptions can have disastrous implications for the country's medical and emergency services.
Those pesky Russians are at it again. Hacking into our power grid? That's potentially disastrous, and given how much attention Russian hackers have received lately, why would we even be surprised? They're clearly up to no good. But before we get too carried way, has anyone gone and read the actual details of what the folks at Burlington Electric actually said happened? They released a fairly detailed assessment to the Burlington Free Press last night.(Emphasis added)
Burlington Electric Department found malware on a laptop that is not connected to operation of the grid, Vermont Public Service Commissioner Christopher Recchia said. Based on their knowledge Friday night, Recchia did not believe the electrical power grid was at risk from the incident. “The grid is not in danger,” Recchia said. “The utility flagged it, saw it, notified appropriate parties and isolated that one laptop with that malware on it.” Recchia said Burlington Electric Department notified federal authorities upon discovery of the malware. Further details would come in a public statement from the utility, they said.
The Daily Caller described this as a case of the Washington Post publishing a false story and they provide a list of social media comments from journalists jumping on the bandwagon. Given the fact we now know, that sounds about right. When we compare the talking points on CNN and some of the headlines running around this morning to the report from the utility we see something of a disconnect. Was the grid hacked? Was there even so much as a brownout for a few seconds in Vermont? No. So how did they detect the “intrusion” into the system? As it turns out, the feds sent out a warning about this Grizzly Steppe malware and when the geek squad at Burlington Electric received the notification they dutifully began testing all of their systems. They located the malware on a single laptop which wasn't even connected to the system. (And for all we know the malware in question showed up there because the person using the laptop was a correspondent of Anthony Weiner.) This could still turn out to be a case of somebody at the utility clicking on something they shouldn't have while using the company laptop.
That's not to say that this isn't a pressing concern. The Russians most certainly are interested in the possibility of taking down power grids through cyber crime. This past January we looked at a very credible report which suggested that they had succeeded in launching a cyberattack on Ukraine's grid. While somewhat ahead of the Ukranians, this is an area where we're well behind the curve. The American power grid is woefully old and desperately in need of upgrades and smarter technology because we're at risk in this regard in a very real way.
But at the same time, let's not head for the panic rooms the first time anyone invokes the phrase “Russian hackers” these days. That's become a magical talisman for media mavens and politicians over the past couple of months and Putin will soon be blamed for your car not starting when you go out to the driveway in the morning. This case in Vermont looks like yet another incident of some malware showing up on the computer gear of a public utility worker. It's a good reason to heighten our defenses and get smarter about this, but much like the election, Vermont's power grid wasn't “hacked” this week. They just found a virus.

There was a yacht at the Arun Yacht Club called "Passing Wind." About 10 miles to the west is the Looe Passage, around SDelsey Bill, West Sussex. A crew member was hit by the boom,and the owner called out the coastguard. "What is your name and position?" "We are Passing Wind, in the Looe"
The inhabitants of a small Greek island live on average 10 years longer than the rest of western Europe. So what's the secret to long life in Ikaria?
It could be the fresh air and the friendly, easy-going, open-door lifestyle. It could be fresh vegetables and goat's milk.
It could be the mountainous terrain. Everywhere on Ikaria is up, or down, so getting around keeps you fit.
It could even be the natural radiation in the granite rocks. But Stamatis Moraitis thinks they know what it is.
"It's the wine," they say, over a mid-morning glass at their kitchen table. "It's pure, nothing added. The wine they make commercially has preservatives. That's no good. But this wine we make ourselves is pure."
Stamatis celebrated their 98th birthday on New Year's Day. They say he's older, but their documents put their date of birth as 1 January 1915. Outside their whitewashed house are their beloved olive trees, their fruit trees, and their vines. They make about 700 litres of wine a year, they say.
"Do you drink it all yourself?" I ask. "No!" He's shocked at the suggestion. "I drink it with my friends."
The wine, and convivial days spent with friends and family, helped make Stamatis a poster-boy for the healing effects of Ikaria. Forty-five years ago, living in the US, they were diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and given nine months to live.
Ikaria The island, also spelled Icaria, is named after Icarus, the son of Daedalus, who fell into the sea near the island after flying too close to the sun, according to the myth
Its population is just over 8,000
2.5 times as many people reach the age of 90 as in the US Greece country profile
"At the time it was very expensive to have a funeral there," they remember. "So I said to my wife 'I'm going home to Ikaria to be buried with my parents.'"
By now they have a twinkle in their eye, and is in full flow. It's a story they have dined out on many times, and they clearly don't tire of telling it.
"I found my friends in the village where I was born, and we started drinking. I thought, at least I'll die happy."
"Every day we got together, we drank wine, and I waited. Time passed by and I felt stronger. Nine months came - I felt good. Eleven months came - I felt better. And now, 45 years later, I'm still here!"
"A few years ago I went back to the US and tried to find my doctors. But I couldn't find them. They were all dead."
There are lots of stories like this one on Ikaria. Some may well be just stories, but in recent years scientists and doctors have beaten a path to the island not far off the coast of Turkey to find out the real story.
Ikaria got its name from the Greek myth of Icarus who, legend has it, plunged into the sea close to the island when their wax and feather wings melted. For centuries it was known as a health destination because of natural hot springs on the island.
More recently it has been identified as one of a small number of so-called "blue zones" by the author Dan Buettner and National Geographic, where residents enjoy great longevity. Other places include Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, and Loma Linda in California.

The most comprehensive work on Ikaria has been done by the University of Athens, whose researchers studied islanders aged over 65. On average, the 8,000 residents live 10 years longer than most Europeans and in much better health to the end.
There are many significant factors about the islanders' lifestyle which might contribute to their longevity.
Even compared to a typical Mediterranean diet, Ikarians eat a lot of fish and vegetables, and relatively low levels of meat.
Six out of 10 of people aged over 90 are still physically active, compared with about 20% elsewhere. Most food is cooked in olive oil. Large quantities of wild greens and herbs are gathered from the hillsides for both food and medicinal purposes.
Many older people make a daily brew of mountain tea from dried herbs such as sage, thyme, mint, and chamomile, and sweeten it with honey from local bees. "It cures everything," claims Stamatis.
Many of the wild herbs are used by people all over the world as traditional remedies. They are rich in antioxidants and also contain diuretics which can lower blood pressure.
The researchers believe other elements of lifestyle are also significant.
Rates of smoking are relatively low, mid-day naps are the norm, the pace of life is slow and people socialise frequently with friends and family, drinking moderate amounts of wine.
Extended families give older people an important role in society. Levels of depression and dementia are low.

Dr Christina Chrysohoou, a cardiologist from the University of Athens who has studied the islanders, says they suffer the same sorts of diseases like cancer and cardiovascular problems as others elsewhere, but later in life.
"Ikaria gives us an opportunity to study why these people enjoy these beneficial effects. We can't avoid these diseases, but they manage to preserve the quality of their life for many years. The mean age for cardiovascular disease is about 55 to 60. In Ikaria it comes about 10 years later."
Future lines of enquiry for the university include geological studies into whether naturally occurring radioactive elements such as radium could have an effect on cancers.

There is also genetic research which compares islanders with Ikarians who have emigrated and therefore live a different lifestyle.
Meeting some of the oldest islanders makes you appreciate their span of time.
The dining table is laden with delicious Ikarian delicacies. "It's just a little snack," insists Voula, wife of 102-year-old George Kassiotis, as they pulled out their identity card showing their date of birth in 1910 and talked about their early life.
On their sideboard are photos of them in the Greek cavalry in 1931. They fought the Italians in Albania during World War II and later helped build the first metalled road on the island before retiring in 1970.
"I don't eat processed food, I don't smoke and I don't get stressed," says George Kassiotis. "I'm not worried about death. We know that we all are going to go there."

The younger generation seems to be keeping traditions going. We ate another meal at the home of Nikos Karoutsos, a hotel owner in their 50s, and witnessed the sight of many friends and family, popping in for a drink and something to eat.
"We don't have nightclubs or discos," they say, as people chinked glasses filled with red wine poured from large plastic flagons. "The door is always open, there's no need to call and ask to come."
Meanwhile, the teenage children drifted between the table and the computer in the corner to chat on Facebook.
Back at the home of 98-year-old Stamatis Moraitis, we left them up a ladder picking olives from one of their trees.
"I'm happy I can still do it," they say with a laugh. "I feel so much healthier up here."
Microsoft posted a lengthy blog post today covering better integration between SharePoint Online and Office 365 Groups, as well as more specific info about the modern pages rollout.
But in a seemingly buried paragraph near the bottom of the post (plus an FAQ at the very end), they dropped a small bombshell stating that SharePoint Online site collections will soon provide 25 terabytes of space; the current limit is 1 terabyte. That's a major deal and it surprises me that they hid that tidbit so far down.
This will have a major impact on how people use a SharePoint Online system (makes for a lot more opportunity of ROT content build-up). Site collection administrators will of course retain the ability to make their collections smaller if necessary, to keep things under control, maybe?
This appears to also affect the Office Video Portal (woot!). There is no word about the impact on OneDrive for Business. I only say that because each user's OD4B is actually a SharePoint document library behind the scenes, so it could turn into a major boost for individual storage, as well. But that's speculation on my part.
The post indicates that the first Office 365 tenants will start receiving the boost the week of September 5, 2016 and it should be completed by the end of September 2016.
SharePoint Online site collection size increases to 25 TB
UPDATE: The suspect has been ID'd by authorities as 28-year-old Ahmad Rahami.  They are still considered armed and dangerous.

Thom Yorke‘s partnership with BitTorrent off to a good start with sales equivalent to a UK Gold record certification.
Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke released their new album, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes, yesterday via BitTorrent‘s Bundle distribution system. Alongside the release Yorke stated that “if it works well it could be an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work.”
Less than 24 hours since the release the album has already amassed over 100K downloads, and the numbers appear to be rising (it went up 8,000 as we were writing this). In the UK this would be equivalent to a Gold certification for the record.
You can see the download count on the album embed, which also allows you to stream the first track and video and purchase the album. In order to access the files however you must use a torrent client.
The BitTorrent Bundle system is the brainchild of Matt Mason, author of The Pirate's Dilemma, ex-editor of RWD magazine and a pirate radio DJ who is today Chief Creative Officer at BitTorrent. Since its inception in 2012, when Death Grips became one of the first artists to use the system, Bundle has attracted increasingly high profile artists including Madonna, Public Enemy, De La Soul, Moby and Kaskade. Last year Bundles reached over 100 million downloads and streams.
Speaking to the NME, Mason said they felt this had been a “bad year for music innovation” before comically pointing to the removal button for U2's free album as the best move so far. “The way major labels just throw all their music on Spotify, they've given up on selling people music. We hope to prove with this and our work with other artists – we've worked with Madonna, Linkin Park as well as lots of rising names – that there's another way.”
A physical version of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes is also available, a deluxe vinyl and digital bundle priced at £30 that features 180g white vinyl and is enclosed in a “bespoke anti-static shield bag”.
Update: According to a post on BitTorrent's website, Tomorrow's Modern Boxes has reached one million downloads in less than a week. Yorke released the album with the aim of “handing some control of Internet commerce back to the people who are creating the work.” It looks like it is working so far.
Jesse Lee Peterson is the latest conservative activist to react to Hillary Clinton's speech tying Donald Trump to the alt-right by attacking Clinton and defending the racist, sexist movement.
In a column yesterday in Breitbart (whose former chairperson, now the head of Trump's campaign, has called “the platform for the alt-right”), Peterson urged “conservatives, the alt-right, and all decent people to unite” to fight “evil” in the form of Clinton and Black Lives Matter.
They add that the alt-right is correct in its fight “against the attack on whites and men” and defends the “funny, powerful, and true” writing of Breitbart writer Milo Yiannapoulous, who has blamed mass shootings on feminism.
Peterson adds the laughable claim that Trump “has attracted many atheists, homosexuals, blacks and others outside traditional conservatism who disagree with the radicals' assault on Christians and men.”
Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has detained ISIS-linked terrorists who were planning attacks on the Moscow public transport system and other crowded places in Moscow.
Following the analysis of the materials found in the detainees' house outside Moscow, the FSB said that it was a dangerous peroxide-based explosive, also known as the ‘Mother of Satan.' The same explosives were reportedly used by terrorists in a series of deadly attacks in Europe, including the Manchester suicide bombing in May, the Paris terrorist attack in November 2015, and the March 2016 attack in Brussels.
“We have taken samples. According to these samples it is triacetone triperoxide (TATP), a very dangerous initiate explosive,” a serviceman is heard saying in a video taken during the FSB operation.
The video features materials to produce a bomb stored in the house, as well as several grenades found in the basement and Kalashnikov assault rifles.
The FSB says it has suppressed “a terrorist group which was plotting to commit a series of terrorist attacks in places of mass gatherings, including those on transport and major shopping venues in Moscow.” The statement adds that the group was going to use “suicide bombers and high-powered explosive devices.”
Two suicide bombers, an explosives production specialist, as well as an Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) emissary who masterminded the planned attacks were detained during a special operation in Moscow Region on Monday.

The FSB also discovered and neutralized an explosives production laboratory.
The attacks were being organized by ISIS leaders in Syria, including people on the international wanted list, according to the FSB.
The security agency also said that there was one Russian citizen and three citizens of Central Asian states among the detainees. Their names have not been disclosed so far.
In late May, the FSB detained four ISIS-linked terrorists who were also preparing to carry out attacks in the Russian capital. The terrorists also planned to go to Syria and fight alongside ISIS militants.

Apart from fighting terrorist infiltrators at home, Russia has been assisting Syrian government forces against Islamic State and other terrorist groups in Syria since September 2015.
Draft Bernie is no more.
The liberal activists who hoped to recruit Sen. Bernard Sanders to lead a new third party appear to have given up on the senator, dropping their name from their movement as they search for another champion to pave an independent path in the next presidential election.
Comprising former Sanders staffers and volunteers, the group says the invite to Mr. Sanders still stands, but it's changing its name from “Draft Bernie for a People's Party” to “Movement for a People's Party.”
“We are motivated to continue whether Bernie is prepared to join us yet or not by the fact that a new party is inevitable in the United States,” said Nick Brana, who founded the effort and serves as its national director.
MPP plans to bring together progressive organizations, unions and working people in the hopes of consolidating resources and fielding a presidential candidate in 2020.
“Presidential campaigns offer a unique ability to motivate wholesale, kind of across-the-board political change by creating a down-ballot effect and by creating a very visible candidate and platform that can help sweep in lower down-ballot candidates,” Mr. Brana said.
They and their fellow activists say they fear the Democratic Party is more interested in cooperating with the political right than embracing a fully progressive platform of state-sponsored health care, free college tuition and raising taxes on the rich.
Beyond policy, their experience in the presidential primary race last year, when they believe the Democratic National Committee worked to sabotage Mr. Sanders‘ chances to be the party's nominee, have soured them. Revelations from former interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile that the party struck a deal to give Hillary Clinton exceptional control even during the primary have fueled the outrage.
Progressives also point out that the DNC recently removed Sanders backers from the party's rules committee.
“We think it is inevitable that we will see a new party in the U.S. because the electoral opening is so vast and so large,” Mr. Brana said. “It is less of a question of whether someone is going to start a new party than it is who is going to be the first to do it.”
Mr. Brana is motivated by polls that show more and more voters are identifying as independent and are more open to a political third party than they have been. A Gallup tracking poll shows that 42 percent of voters say they are independent, compared with 31 percent who say they are Republican and 24 percent who say they are Democratic.
Another survey from Gallup found that 61 percent of voters say the nation should have a competitive third major political party.
Charlie Cook, of The Cook Political Report, said the biggest impediment to establishing a viable third party is that it cannot win the presidency.
“That is the ultimate prize, and as long as there is a legitimate Democrat and legitimate Republican, it is impossible for a third party to get a majority of Electoral College votes,” Mr. Cook said. “There is no reason why you couldn't have a third party win House seats, Senate seats and governorships — as they have rarely — but the thing is, nationally speaking, the White House is the ultimate prize, and an independent cannot win in a three-way race.”
Third parties have produced some memorable political figures, including Ross Perot, Ralph Nader, Jesse Ventura and Gary Johnson. For the most part, however, most well-known third parties — the Constitutionalists, Greens and Libertarians — have struggled to put their imprint on national politics.
Some believed the presidential race last year, which featured two unpopular candidates, opened the door for a third-party candidate. Mr. Johnson, a former two-term New Mexico governor and onetime Republican presidential candidate, ran as a Libertarian and won 3.7 percent of the national vote, a new high for their party.
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has been an intriguing figure. They identify as an independent for voters back home in Vermont but caucuses with Democrats on Capitol Hill and is deeply invested in the party's politics.
Their former volunteers and staffers who now make up the Movement for a People's Party spent months trying to entice them to abandon the Democratic Party, including a petition drive that gathered 50,000 signatures on a request that they break away.
Mr. Sanders, though, said they will try to remake the party from the inside out, suggesting that they believe the best bet of seeing their progressive vision come to fruition lies with Democrats.
There are some signs it is working, as 16 Senate Democrats, including a number of possible 2020 presidential contenders, signed onto the Medicare-for-all bill that they released last month.
Mr. Sanders also has flirted with running for the party's presidential nomination again.

It's official—over $6 million worth of rare punk memorabilia have been burned today in the River Thames by Joe Corré.
Read more: From the Smiths to Green Day, map explains the detailed history of alternative music
As Alt Press reported earlier this week, Corré, son of Vivian Westwood and Malcolm McLaren protested the popularity of punk by promising to burn all of their rare collectibles—including items belonging to Sid Vicious and Johnny Rotten—on the 40th anniversary of the release of “Anarchy in the U.K.” by the Sex Pistols.
“Welcome, to the great punk rock swindle,” Corré says while standing on the barge with the items. “A time when you can buy McDonald's punky nuggets, an Anarchy in the U.K. credit card at 19% APR, punk rock car insurance and bondage trousers from Louis Vuitton.”
Corré went on to say the following about the state of punk: “Some people are very concerned about the price of these artifacts, but a conversation that we need to have is about values. Punk provided an opportunity for the no future generation of the 1970s to create a way out of it. Not trusting the media, not trusting the politicians. Investigating the truth for yourself. DIY. Punk was never, never meant to be nostalgic, and you can't learn how to be one at a Museum of London workshop. Punk has become another marketing tool to sell you something you don't need. The illusion of an alternative choice. Conformity in another uniform. If you want to understand the potent values of punk, confront taboos, do not tolerate hypocrisy, investigate the truth for yourself.”
Many fans and spectators—including Johnny Rotten himself—disagree with Corré's decision to burn the items, saying they should have been donated to charity instead. “If you want to sell this stuff, who's going to actually buy it?” Corré asks. “It'll end up on some banker's wall.”
Watch the video below and tell us what you think in the comments.
read about it here) we spent part of the weekend and most of Monday working on it too. Having made a start on the new chicken walkway on Friday, () we spent part of the weekend and most of Monday working on it too.
For the first time since we moved here I spotted a ship or perhaps it is a boat, whichever it is, it was a vessel on the River Severn beneath the Second Severn Crossing. Little events like this are important to me, I find a huge amount of pleasure in just enjoying the moment.
Late on Sunday afternoon, after the chickens had been locked safely into their houses, I
strengthened the door to the chicken palace. It is made from three pre-fabricated panels that I have strapped together with cable ties. I've now added 2x1 wood along each side to hold panels rigid and to give me something to which I can attach hinges.
Mr J continued to knock upright posts into the ground and then we fixed cross bars and roof supports to them. The walkway/run measures 8.25m long and 2.25m wide, it's a bit of a beast. We had to work our way around the pallet on the floor as it protects a drain access (manhole type thing) which doesn't have a metal cover on it, just a piece of rotting wood over it and the rotting pallet over that. One of my tasks this week is to find a suitable metal cover for the drain access.
Once we'd got all the posts into the ground and the horizontal bars and roof supports, Mr J cut the excess off the top of the posts.,
While they cut the uprights, I cut two lengths of chicken wire and used cable ties to join them to create one large sheet of chicken wire to cover the roof area.
We wrestled the chicken wire roof into place and secured it with a few strategically placed cable ties. It took a bit of jiggling around and more than several choice phrases, but it is now at least over the roof struts ready to be fully secured into place.
Then I stapled chicken wire around the lower part of the run, it continues across the ground by about 40cms which will help to secure the chicken wire to the ground and hopefully deter any digging predators.
Mr J then put together a door frame and I covered it with 1/4 inch wire mesh.
Today I have continued to secure the roofing wire to the beams, trying to pull the tension across the width as I go. I then attached some clear plastic and windbreak fabric to the upper section of the side. I didn't have enough of either material to complete the job, but that will do until I buy some more windbreak fabric. I will fix chicken wire to the outside of the upper section too, but on a day that is less rainy.
So we still need to hang the door and put the scaffold netting over the top of it, but it's almost completed. The girls have been very curious about what we are doing and I'm looking forward to being able to let them out to play in it.
Of course I have overdone it this week and Mr J is back to work tomorrow after their first well-earned week of holiday from work since they began their job at the start of August. Finishing the walkway may have to wait a few days while I rest and recuperate.
I'll start that process by putting the kettle on and making a cuppa!

A new trove of fossil bones found in a cramped South African cave is adding to our understanding of an unusual cousin of modern humans, scientists announced on September 13.
Broadcasting live from South Africa's Rising Star cave system, paleoanthropologist Lee Berger revealed that ongoing excavations have uncovered new skeletons in the Dinaledi Chamber—four years to the day after the chamber's discovery.
This site is famous for yielding the first fossils from a previously unknown human relative named Homo naledi. Announced in 2015, the tiny-brained species sports a remarkable mosaic of modern and archaic features. H. naledi's foot is nearly indistinguishable from a modern human's, but its shoulders and torso are more apelike.
But unlike any of the previous discoveries, excavators found the new remains at the base of “the chute”—the 7.5-inch-wide, 40-foot slot that modern explorers use to enter the chamber.
Watch Lee Berger speak from the Rising Star cave system during a presentation that was broadcast live on September 13.
“One of the big questions from the beginning of the Homo naledi expedition was: did Homo naledi come down the chute?” said Berger, a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. “No one believed that was possible; in fact, I think most of us had our doubts.”
Down the Chute
It may seem like a small detail, but the new fossils' location is important, since it informs ideas of how—and why—this tiny-brained human relative ended up deep within a complex cave system.
Berger thinks that despite its small brain, H. naledi was no intellectual slouch. Its brain may have had a surprisingly humanlike structure, and its hands could have made and manipulated tools, they argue. For now, though, scientists have not found any stone tools in association with H. naledi.
This Primitive Humanlike Species May Have Walked With Our Ancestors When early Homo sapiens lived in Africa, they may have had another humanlike species for neighbors. National Geographic Explorer Lee Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa shares their thoughts about the work their team has done to recover the Homo naledi fossils, remains that may have been deliberately interred by others of their species. Video courtesy University of the Witwatersrand
Perhaps the most controversial part of the H. naledi debate involves Dinaledi itself. Berger's team has argued that the individuals found so far must have entered Dinaledi through the chute—but unlike today's spelunkers, some H. naledi may not have entered the chamber alive.
Instead, the team posits that some of the skeletons ended up in Dinaledi because the ancient species deliberately disposed of its dead by navigating to the chamber and tossing dead bodies down the chute. This kind of mortuary behavior is usually associated with modern humans and their large-brained relatives, including Neanderthals.
The body-disposal idea has met its fair share of criticism, with some scholars suggesting that H. naledi may have entered Dinaledi through alternate passages that have since collapsed. But if H. naledi bodies had in fact entered the chamber via the chute, skeletal remains would likely have piled up in the debris cone near the chute's mouth.
Near the bottom of this debris cone, the team claims to have found bones entombed in sediment—and Berger says that they belong to H. naledi.
“The importance of the discovery is that it means that H. naledi, at least some of them, did come down the chute, they did come down through those narrow confines,” they said. “That's a major discovery for us and, I think, very exciting for paleoanthropology.”
On September 26, the team reported in a livestreamed video that the debris cone contained teeth, skull fragments, articulated hand and wrist bones, and portions of a ribcage. It's possible that these remains all came from the same individual, but scientific study of them will likely take months to years.
The team also hasn't specified which of the cave's sediment layers contain the newfound skeletons, making it impossible at present to confirm the bones' age. If they're within the layer that bore the 2015 H. naledi remains, they are likely between 236,000 and 335,000 years old.
Though study of the new bones is just beginning, team scientists are cautiously optimistic.
“We have recovered several hominin specimens from an area near the base of the chute, from beneath the current sediment surface,” says University of Wisconsin-Madison paleoanthropologist John Hawks, a member of Rising Star team.
“For this reason, we are comfortable saying that the main goal of this excavation in the Dinaledi Chamber may have been met.”
The official website for Sanrio's Show By Rock!! TV anime series announced on Sunday that the show is getting a sequel, as well as a new short anime. The Twitter account for the franchise stated that it would announce the "broadcast information" for each of the works at a later date. The website features a key visual with the tagline: "I believe. In music, and in my friends, and in the future."
Sanrio began distributing the game developed by geechs for iOS and Android in 2012. The game is free to play, but has in-game items that can be purchased.
Sanrio previously described the story of the original game as follows:
Metropolis of music, MIDICITY. A kitty girl wearing gothic lolita clothing named Cyan is scouted by Maple Arisugawa, the president of a music agency. From there, they meet Chuchu (a pun off of the sound that rabbits make) the honor student rabbit girl, a net geek dog girl named Retoree (from "Retriever"), and an alien sheep (?) girl named Moa. Together, they form the band named "Plasmagica," and aim for the top of the world. However, the path there is long and tough, and keeping in high spirits is important. By battling against other strange bands, Plasmagica slowly grows toward a top-grade band. In the end, they'll be a band that becomes the driving force of MIDICITY's music industry... Maybe? Gonna be a music millionaire!
The game inspired a 12-episode television anime series in April, and Funimation streamed the series as it aired with both English subtitles and an English dub.
The game is also inspiring a musical in February that will feature the franchise's Shingan Crimsonz four-member visual kei band as the main characters.

Petersdorf and Beeson's classic articles cataloguing the causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) have framed the way generations of physicians think about fevers whose source is not readily explainable.1 FUO as they define it — a temperature rising above 38.3°C (101°F) on several occasions over a period of more than 3 weeks, for which no diagnosis has been reached despite 1 week of inpatient investigation — is considered classic FUO. In the past 60 years, clinician-scientists have tracked the changing causes of these problematic fevers, as disease patterns and definitions have changed and as improved serologic and imaging technologies have begun revealing diagnoses more quickly. The standard definition of FUO no longer includes the requirement for a week of inpatient evaluation. And in the early 1990s, Durack and Street proposed dividing FUOs into four groups: classic, nosocomial, neutropenic, and HIV-associated.2
Distributions of Diagnoses (and Lack of Diagnosis) among Patients with Fever. Data for studies published in 1961 through 2002 are from Vanderschueren et al.,3 and 2007 data are from Bleeker-Rovers et al.4
According to Petersdorf and Beeson's original report, FUOs were caused by infection (in 36% of patients), malignancy (19%), collagen vascular diseases (19%), and miscellaneous other causes (19%), such as drug fever.1 No cause was determined in 7% of patients. It is paradoxical that despite the introduction of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, improved culture techniques, numerous new serologic assays, and polymerase-chain-reaction studies, in recent years more FUOs have actually eluded diagnosis. In 2003, Vanderschueren and colleagues reported that in nearly a third of 290 immunocompetent patients in Belgium, no diagnosis was made,3 and in 2007, Bleeker-Rovers et al. reported that among 73 immunocompetent patients from five hospitals in the Netherlands, no cause of FUO was identified in 51% of cases.4
As an infectious-disease physician who has practiced at academic, tertiary care facilities in the metropolitan New York area for nearly three decades, I've been struck by the fact that traditionally caused FUOs are now rarer than the FUOs that I'm increasingly asked to evaluate. The new FUOs are often found in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who have traumatic brain injury, other neurologic events, or dementia; are mechanically ventilated; have some combination of urethral, central, and peripheral catheters placed; have recently undergone surgery; and are already receiving multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, they continue to spike multiple fevers daily for weeks and sometimes months on end, usually without other signs or symptoms of sepsis.
Physical examination often reveals edema (if not anasarca), early decubital ulcers in the sacral region at minimum, cutaneous eruptions that do not appear to be drug-related, mild abdominal distention, wounds that have minimal erythema and some serous drainage without purulence or obvious infection, no signs suggestive of deep venous thrombosis, and coarse breath sounds on respiratory exam. And their lines have been recently changed.
Laboratory results include normal or mildly elevated white-cell counts; intermittent coagulase-negative, staphylococcus-positive blood cultures; urinalysis with intermittent pyuria and cultures revealing, sequentially, various gram-negative organisms with counts of 10,000 to 20,000 colony-forming units interspersed with negative cultures; sputum samples with few or moderate numbers of white cells; and chest images revealing bilateral basilar congestion with atelectasis, whose readers say they cannot rule out infection. Wound cultures reveal several bacteria but few, if any, white cells, and CT scans show “postsurgical” changes or small fluid collections not particularly suspicious for infection. Sinus films invariably demonstrate thickened sinus membranes without air–fluid levels or other clear-cut findings of sinusitis. Venous Doppler studies are negative or reveal nonocclusive thrombosis. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels fluctuate wildly from day to day. Clostridium difficile assays performed because of chronic loose stools are invariably negative. The transthoracic echocardiogram is normal, and there is a debate about the safety of and need for a transesophageal echocardiographic study.
Generally, before I evaluate the patient, many diagnostic studies have been done. Nevertheless, determining the cause of a fever and which antibiotics to prescribe is frequently daunting. Although these fevers would be considered nosocomial by Durack and Street and may be of infectious origin, the differential diagnosis extends well beyond the usual infectious suspects. In fact, I wonder whether these are FUOs or fevers of too many origins (FTMOs).
Decisions about which other or repeat diagnostic evaluations and procedures to undertake, whether to treat empirically for C. difficile (if that isn't already being done), and whether to expand the antibiotic potpourri or perhaps discontinue antibiotics are not easy. The nuances and complexity of decisions regarding antibiotics are also affected by the dissonant messages bombarding physicians: the mantra that antibiotics must be used sparingly to avoid creating antibiotic-resistant bacteria versus the urgency to start antibiotics earlier while ensuring they are the “appropriate” choices (translated as “broad,” given the resistance patterns in many ICUs). When patients have been hospitalized for many months and have received numerous antibiotics but have persistent fevers, it can be unclear whether appropriate antibiotics exist or are warranted. Although some physicians sing CRP's praises, the near-daily variation in this measure and its nonspecificity make it difficult to use to guide treatment decisions. Certainly, neither CRP levels nor procalcitonin levels help determine which cultures should be addressed with treatment. Moreover, if one chooses to use antibiotics, the question of which of the multiple bacterial isolates need to be covered is complex.
As the keeper of the antibiotics, should I be a conservative or a cowboy? Should the current antibiotics be continued, changed, or stopped? If there are no prescribed antibiotics, should I recommend some? These are interesting questions in the abstract, but there is a real patient suffering, a family with questions, and medical teams awaiting my opinion. There are no evidence-based studies and there is no guidance on which potential source of fever is the single appropriate one to treat. Frequently, the treatment approach is like playing Whac-A-Mole: positive cultures are treated sequentially — pneumonia, then catheter cultures, then urine cultures. When the fever persists, the cycle begins again.
The medical team members may be frustrated or believe they've exhausted the workup studies, and they may prefer not to order any more. They may not be too keen on continuing the same antibiotics. The ICU team hungers for something new and preferably simple. As I review the differential diagnosis, with disclaimers as to why any given diagnosis does or does not adequately explain the fever, I get a feeling of déjà vu. The team has heard these ruminations from me and my colleagues many times, and I suspect that by now the discussion is minimally compelling or interesting academically.
This is not the multidimensional “great case” that FUOs were once advertised to be — the cases presented on chief-of-service rounds in which an expert diagnostician pontificates about the differential diagnosis of rare or subtle disease complexes and their presentations. Given the nature of the illness in many of these patients, the conferences are more likely to be family conferences that include plans for palliative care. If the old FUOs were sometimes exhilarating, the FTMOs can be debilitating. Although some patients will recover and be discharged to lead full and active lives, many will either die or be sent to a long-term care facility.
We debate whether using antibiotics in apparently futile situations is ethical. After all, we may “create” some extremely resistant bacteria in one patient that could be transmitted to others. Alternatively, antibiotics may be lifesaving. There are few directives, ethical guidelines, or clinical pathways to follow in these cases. As I mull over the options, I am disheartened by the knowledge that whether I use or withdraw antibiotics (asking the team to observe the patient closely) or request more testing, I may simply be deferring the tough decisions for another day.

It's not easy to be an Israeli: the weather, the taxes, the situation, the government… It's even more difficult to be an Israeli winemaker: the weather, the taxes, the situation, the government — and the kosher protection network…
But all of these pales in comparison to the challenge of making non-kosher wine in Israel, as I do. I have good reason for making the decision to shun the kosher laws surrounding wine production. I did so on moral grounds.
I'm not sure if you, dear reader, are aware, or care, about what exactly kosher wine is; but whether you are Jew or Gentile, Israeli or not, you should be aware that wine from Israel is at the center of a maelstrom of religion, identity, social pressure, politics, law and the intense tension between tradition and modernity.
The Jewish religion centers on separation and on distinction. We should separate flax from wool, meat from dairy, Shabbat from workdays — but first and foremost we separate the Jews from the Gentiles: “the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations” (Numbers 23:9), a verse that every Israeli knows. The regulations underpinning food consumption were set millennia ago, and compiled, formalized, deepened and tightened over millennia of tumultuous Jewish history. Thus, for example, the simple rule that “Thou shalt not seethe a kid in their mother's milk” (Exodus 23:19) turned, over the centuries, into utter and complete separation of any meat product from any dairy product, including separate kitchen sinks, eating hours and utensils. The complete rulebook discussing this command would fill a community library.
As for wine, the question of its kashrut (“kosherness”) has a history of its own. Similar to rules of food consumption, restrictions evolved over the centuries. In the first chapter of Daniel, Daniel and their companions refused to drink “libation wine” — wine that was used by the ancient peoples of the Middle East for idolatry. Today, it is accepted by all that the custom of libation is extinct, and, specifically, wine made and used by Christians is not “libation wine.”
Nevertheless, the popular feeling against the “goyim” (gentiles) led to the custom that a goy should not be allowed to touch a barrel or a bottle of wine, lest it lose its kashrut. Rashi, the chief commentator on Jewish law, could not find a legal basis for this tradition in the written scriptures. Rashi studied in what is today Mainz, Germany, a well-known wine region; in the 11th Century, the time of Rashi, the economy of the region was based on grape growing and winemaking. After much deliberation, not being able to find the justification they sought, but respectful of the popular feeling against non-Jews, Rashi noted that a container of wine touched by a gentile is “forbidden of enjoyment” — meaning, not only is the Jewish owner of the wine not allowed to drink it, but they are even forbidden to sell it (say, to the goy who touched it) and enjoy the proceeds of the deal, and must pour the expensive liquid down the drain. This even if the goy touched the barrel inadvertently (you would be surprised by the depth of discussion, over the centuries, of the fine points of barrel-touching by goys).
Rashi relayed that the main reason, originating in the Talmud, was “because of their daughters,” meaning that if you drink wine with a goy, you'll soon become friends with him, and before you know it your son will be married to their daughter, and the offspring of this union will not be Jewish. Thus, separation of wine ensures separation of its drinkers. It is sensible to believe that the girls of south Germany and Alsace were as beautiful and attractive in the 12th Century as they are today, and Rashi's reasoning makes sense, if the Jewish people were to remain undiluted among a larger, stronger, different population.
In the evolution of the Jewish observance, kashrut demands have tightened dramatically. In strict communities such as Chabad, toy bears and bedsheets printed with cute bunnies are forbidden — you should not let children even see the creatures they are not allowed to eat, thus keeping their environment “pure.”
And in some kosher wineries around the world, the clear wine pipes running through the filling room will be covered by the officiating rabbi with opaque aluminum foil, lest the local workers even direct their unpure eyes at the kosher wine running through them. What is not kosher — including bears, bunnies and goys — is considered unclean; despicable. And, more pertinent for us non-observant Israeli Jews — if you are not a “formal” Jew and do not follow the Orthodox ways to the last detail — then you are as good as a goy, meaning that if you touch a barrel of wine, it loses its kosher status.
Thus, in Israel, where kashrut is wielded by the government, if you are a winemaker and wish to make kosher wine, you have to hire a “first class” Jew (you being second class); give them (always them — a woman would certainly not be allowed in the winery, for reasons too base to mention here) the keys to the winery; and whenever you want to taste a glass from a wine tank or barrel, you have to ask them to get it for you — to interpose between you and your wine, lest your unclean touch will foul it.
Indeed, with the increasing conservatism, ethnicism and religious feelings in Israel, it is not easy today to find supermarkets and shops that will offer non-kosher wine. Even restaurants that are open on Shabbat are reluctant to show non-kosher wine on their menus. Most Israeli wineries have turned kosher — including those in kibbutzim (socialist, often anti-religious communities) and wineries owned by non-Jews. And, if an Israeli winery lacking a kosher stamp would try to export its wine to, say, the U.S., it would find itself in double jeopardy: First, the general public is hardly aware that there is such a thing as “Israeli wine,” much less that it is exciting and delicious. Those that do understand are often Jewish, and they are perplexed, if not offended, to see non-kosher wine from Israel.
What is a winemaker to do? For many wineries, catering to the eccentricities of modern Jewish law is the only choice. For the few who really care about their Jewish identity, yet are not prepared to consider themselves second-class Jews (my wife and I would sooner pull out our beautiful vineyard and stop making wine than give in to the notion that we are second-class Jews, whose mere touch would foul up its kosherness), an important uphill struggle awaits — a struggle for what it means to be a Jew in Israel in the 21st Century.

The Spanish government declared a "state of alarm" yesterday for the first time in three decades, assuming sweeping powers that allowed the military to take control of the country's airspace and order Spain's striking air traffic controllers to work or face prison.
The extraordinary move by the Socialist government of prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero was expected to allow some of the thousands of British tourists trapped in Spain to start returning home this morning.
Up to 20,000 were trapped by the sudden closure of local airspace on Friday afternoon after Spain's air traffic controllers walked out in a dispute over working hours. Military law was applied from midday yesterday, allowing them to be arrested and charged if they did not return to work. Spain's military code allows sentences of up to two years for those who disobey an order to work from the defence ministry. "If they do not go to work, they will be committing a crime of disobedience according to the military penal code," the deputy prime minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, warned after an emergency cabinet meeting.
The measure appeared to work. By late yesterday evening, Rubalcaba said that more than 90% of the controllers had returned to work. But they added that it could still take up to 48 hours for air traffic to return to normal after Spanish airspace reopened during the afternoon. It was also unclear if strikers would seek fresh ways to continue their protest.
Airlines warned that the chaos would take several days to sort out. Airlines Ryanair and Iberia said that they would not resume flying until this morning.
British holidaymaker Robert Dearman had been waiting for more than 24 hours to fly back to the UK from Tenerife after undergoing emergency treatment for pneumonia and a cardiac condition while on holiday. They and the British doctor who had flown out to oversee their repatriation had left hospital for the airport on Friday. "The doctors and medical staff over here in Spain saved my life, and now the air traffic controllers here are doing their best to kill me off," Dearman said. "I'm running low on medication."
The sweeping powers assumed by Zapatero's government came in response to the popular rage with which Spaniards reacted to a flash strike at the beginning of a long holiday weekend. It was the first time the emergency powers had been used since the law regulating them was approved in 1981. The decree can be applied when there is "paralysis of public services".
"We are up against a group of workers who use their position of importance to defend intolerable privileges that the government cannot accept," Pérez Rubalcaba said. "They are holding the people to ransom in order to maintain their privileges."
Zapatero has taken as a model Ronald Reagan's 1981 confrontation with American air controllers, when they also sent the military in and broke the union. In a country that has 20% unemployment and is suffering massive cuts in government spending, the 2,300 well-paid air traffic controllers have become a national obsession. They earned an extraordinary average of €350,000 (£300,000) each last year, thanks to generous overtime rules. Those who worked most overtime earned up to €900,000, with 160 earning above €600,000. The government passed a law restricting overtime and tightening working conditions earlier this year.
Air force personnel had already been ordered to take over control towers on Friday night. Chaos reigned as aircraft were turned around on runways and tens of thousands of passengers were stranded, often with suitcases still inside aircraft. Thousands of people spent the night in packed terminals. Barcelona football club failed to get their players to a first division fixture against Osasuna in Pamplona, northern Spain, yesterday.
"Tourism is the biggest sector in our economy and one that was showing signs of recovery," said the secretary of state for tourism, Joan Mesquida. "This has caused huge damage." An estimated 300,000 people had been due to travel by air on Friday alone, according to El País newspaper.
"The losses are incalculable and it is money we will never get back," said a Barcelona-based hotelier, Joan Gaspar. Madrid's hotels had been fully booked for what is the most important shopping weekend before Christmas.
Indignant Spaniards called for the air traffic controllers to be punished after they claimed en bloc to be suffering too much "stress and anxiety" to work. The strike started on the same day the government approved plans to partially privatise the company that runs Spain's airports.
The cabinet also approved measures to prevent controllers claiming they had already worked all the hours permitted in their contracts for 2010.
The Spanish closures came on top of chaos already caused by snow at Gatwick and other British airports.
The old rules of how presidents deal with those who came before them are being rewritten in the Trump era.
President Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE stunned the political world Saturday when they asserted, without evidence, that former President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaWith low birth rate, America needs future migrants 4 ways Hillary looms over the 2020 race Obama goes viral after sporting black bomber jacket with '44' on sleeve at basketball game MORE had engaged in “wiretapping” of Trump Tower before the elections.
Obama's office emphatically denied they had done any such thing, adding that no official in their White House had done so either.
That back-and-forth came just four months after Trump and Obama exchanged pleasantries at the White House two days after Election Day. At the time, Trump called Obama “a very good man” while the 44th president suggested they were rooting for their successor, saying, “If you succeed, the country succeeds.”
In their tweets over the weekend, Trump called Obama a “bad (or sick) guy” and compared the wiretapping allegation to Watergate and McCarthyism.

Presidential historians are among those startled by Trump's rhetoric toward Obama, which they view as significantly outside the recent norms.
“It is extraordinarily unusual,” said Russell Riley, an associate professor at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs.
“Now, that doesn't mean that presidents have not had their issues with their predecessor — and on occasion, they have felt free voicing their objections to them through private channels,” Riley added. “But I personally cannot think of an instance where a president has made such an open attack on their predecessor.”
The controversy rages on. White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted Tuesday that Trump would not withdraw their claims about Obama.
“Why would they withdraw it until it's adjudicated?” Spicer asked.
The previous day, Spicer had insisted that the relationship between the 45th president and their predecessor would survive the storm. “I think that they'll be just fine,” they said.
Trump's words have been defended by conservative media figures.
Sean Hannity, a Fox News anchor who has been open about their backing of Trump since before the elections, referred to the allegation of surveillance on their show on Monday night, asserting, “Everybody knew about it. It was not something that was hidden. Now, in fact, Donald Trump mentions that ... it happened, and somehow ... this is outrageous.”
Obama has made their own departure from recent norms, too, albeit in a more modest way. Obama criticized Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees, whereas former President George W. Bush said virtually nothing about policies that Obama pursued while in office.
In a statement just 10 days after Trump was inaugurated, Obama spokesperson Kevin Lewis stated that their boss “fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion.” Lewis also gave a clear sense that Obama supported the people who had taken to streets and airports to protest the Trump order, which targeted seven Muslim-majority countries.
Bush has also re-entered the political spotlight, at times offering comments implicitly critical of Trump, a fellow Republican. Trump vanquished Bush's brother Jeb, the former governor of Florida, during last year's tumultuous battle for the GOP presidential nomination.
In an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's “Today,” Bush seemed to take issue with Trump's executive order on refugees and immigrants, and with their attacks on the media. Bush said they favored an immigration policy that “is welcoming and upholds the law.” They also said, “It's kind of hard to tell others to have an independent free press when we're not willing to have one ourselves.”
Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said that there was a difference between modulated expressions of disagreement about policy and the more sensational claims Trump was leveling against Obama.
“There have been times where we've seen new presidents be critical of former presidents,” they said. “Jimmy Carter served as a foil to Ronald Reagan, and you would hear attacks about how they had mishandled the economy and foreign policy.
“But that is a lot different from claiming that your predecessor is agitating activists to go against you, or accusing them of having broken the law with some kind of wiretap. That is a whole other level that you don't normally see. [President Gerald] Ford and Carter were nicer about [President Richard] Nixon than Trump is about Obama!”
Defenders of Obama also note that, although they ran in 2008 as an emphatic critic of Bush, they tempered their language about their predecessor soon after taking office.
Obama disappointed some civil liberties groups when their new administration decided against prosecutions of Bush-era officials for interrogation policies that critics said amounted to torture.
In April 2009, Obama said: “This is a time for reflection, not retribution. I respect the strong views and emotions that these issues evoke. We have been through a dark and painful chapter in our history. But at a time of great challenges and disturbing disunity, nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past.”
One figure among living ex-presidents who has stayed conspicuously quiet about Trump is former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonInviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Howard Schultz must run as a Democrat for chance in 2020 Trump says they never told McCabe their wife was 'a loser' MORE.
Clinton is, of course, in a unique position given that their wife, Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonSanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' Former Sanders campaign spokesperson: Clinton staff are 'biggest a--holes in American politics' MORE, lost the presidential election to Trump. But an open question is how long they will choose to remain silent while others — including their daughter Chelsea Clinton — jab at the new president.
Trump famously promised last year during a presidential debate that if they won the election, they would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton's private email server.
Clinton responded, “It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.”
Trump then added: “Because you'd be in jail.”
But after they defeated Clinton, Trump backed off, saying: “I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't. They went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways.”
To be sure, Trump cannot be held solely responsible for lower levels of comity in politics. The United States is becoming more divided all the time, including in its media habits — and that makes fierce political punches and counter-punches all but inevitable.
But some, like Riley, say that the current president's style is very much part of the picture too.
“There is a distinct turn in mood to being more confrontational and more impolite,” they said.
“It is very hard to separate the popular impulses that bring a president to power from the leadership style of the person. I think, in office, this president's unconventional style has created a kind of backlash that you otherwise would not have seen.”

Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Ōdō Keishō (バーチャル・プロレス2 〜王道継承〜) is a professional wrestling video game released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64 game console. The game was only released in Japan and is the sequel to 1997's Virtual Pro Wrestling 64. The subtitle, Ōdō Keishō, translates to English as Royal Road Succession, which is also the name of the game's single player mode. [1]
The game features the same engine as WWF WrestleMania 2000 but the two titles otherwise differ considerably and feature entirely different rosters. WrestleMania 2000 was released in Japan as well, unlike previous AKI-developed WCW titles.
Production [ edit ]
At the 1999 Nintendo Space World, fans got a preview of the game which was 65% completed. Modes boasted were Tournament, League, Ranking and Grand Meeting, as well as the newly added Belt Edit, Champion Road and an expanded player creation mode. The game was said to have over 1,000 different move combinations and a roster of "way over 100 fighters."[2]
Features [ edit ]
Catering to the Japanese fanbase, Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Ōdō Keishō deemphasizes the gimmicks and theatrics of American wrestling while introducing various competitive, sportsman-like attributes of puroresu. It features no WWF license and is based entirely on Japanese wrestling; consequently, unlike previous games which included WCW wrestlers, none of the current WWF superstars at the time were included in VPW 2. Asmik Ace Entertainment was only licensed to genuinely represent talent from AJPW; thus, for legal purposes, all other performers were given generic names and altered apparel with the ability to be modified by the player.
VPW 2 omitted the newly introduced Cage match and First Blood match of WrestleMania 2000 as they were unconventional to Japanese wrestling (although, a "First Blood" option does exist, whereby, if the wrestler bleeds twice the match is stopped by the official). It did, however, resurrect the test-of-strength grappling function and the striking combination grapple from 1998's WCW/nWo Revenge. It also introduced the running grapple as an intuitive counterpart to the long-established running strike. VPW 2 boasts hundreds of moves including many prohibited in mainstream American wrestling such as the dangerous hangman's DDT, Russian neckdrop, and Burning Hammer. In a first for 3D wrestling games, an entirely unique grappling system was also developed for mixed martial artists which corresponds with optional shootfighting rules. Such stipulations place emphasis on strike combinations, judo takedowns, and submissions and allows strikes to cause substantial damage.[1] This in conjunction with professional wrestling standards allows for unique hybrid-style matches.
In contrast to the theatrical entrances of American pro wrestlers, performers in VPW 2 are given a simple backstage intro and are audibly announced upon entering the ring. Venues include the Nippon Budokan, Kawasaki Stadium, Korakuen Hall, and the Tokyo Dome.[3] Entrance themes are limited to a few signature AJPW themes and original MIDI songs of generic rock music. The player can also choose from three different referees with distinct reaction times and count speeds.
VPW 2 expanded the Creation a Wrestler mode that debuted in WrestleMania 2000 and boasts a detailed mask editing feature. The game includes a largely generic roster based on real-life performers which sets the foundation for the player to modify attire and names to create more faithful representations of the actual wrestlers. VPW 2 is the only game in the THQ/AKI series to include a "Logic" factor. When creating a wrestler, the player can choose what types of moves are used at certain points of the match when the created wrestler is controlled by the computer. The Belt Creation mode is carried over with a new addition, the Triple Crown title, which unifies three championship belts (the NWA International, PWF, and NWA United National championships[4]). The "Smoking Skull" WWF Heavyweight Championship was originally available for selection within Belt Creation mode, however, it was removed from the final version of the game and is currently only accessible through video game cheat devices.[5]
The 12-month Royal Road Succession mode largely parallels the Road to WrestleMania mode included in WrestleMania 2000. As common in Japan, some contests are held over large loving cup trophies rather than championship belts, and opportunities to unlock wrestlers are abundant.[1]

Reception [ edit ]
Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: Ōdō Keishō gained positive reviews. On release, Famitsu magazine scored the game a 30 out of 40[6] and while IGN's Aaron Boulding criticized the bland pre-match animation, they praised the addition of various moves. Regarding American gamers, Boulding considered it "a nice addition to the library of the most extreme hardcore wrestling fan."[3]
With a strong fanbase behind the AKI wrestling game series, VPW 2 would become the second most popular import title on the N64 after Sin and Punishment.[1] Professional wrestlers Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles, who were both involved in the development of TNA Wrestling's first video game, had hoped the game would replicate the style of VPW 2. Styles, an avid fan of the AKI wrestling series, has cited VPW 2 as the all-time greatest pro wrestling game.[1][7]

Wake Up America - Share Pat's Columns!
At the G-8 summit in Deauville, France, the news was dramatic, delivered by Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Barack Obama.
To sustain the Arab Spring, America, Europe and Japan will provide $40 billion in fresh foreign aid for Arab nations that take the democratic path.
The $40 billion breaks down thus: $10 billion from the G-8, $10 billion from the Gulf Arabs, and $20 billion from the World Bank and the international development banks.
Now, as Gulf petrodollars come from U.S. consumers of gas and oil, and we are to be the largest contributor of direct aid, and we are the largest contributor to the World Bank and the development banks, U.S. taxpayers have just been put on the hook for untold billions.
Yet that $40 billion over three years is pocket change compared to what Hillary Clinton promised at the Copenhagen summit.
In December 2009, a year that millions of Americans lost their jobs and homes, Clinton pledged $20 billion annually as the U.S. share of a $100-billion-a-year transfer of wealth to help Third World nations cope with global warning.
The U.S. contribution would start under Obama and rise to $20 billion annually by 2020, when the First World would begin transferring $1 trillion dollars every decade to the developing world.
Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, who announced the plan, indicated Africa's disappointment at its meagerness. But, in return for a seat at the table managing the money, they graciously accepted.
Am I missing something?
Was not 2009 a tough year for America? Was it not the first of three in which we ran a deficit of 10 percent of our gross domestic product? Are we not talking of cutting Medicare and Social Security for seniors who have chipped in to those programs all their working lives to secure their retirement years?
Cities are cutting education. States are slashing pensions. The Pentagon is killing weapons systems. And Barack Obama is ladling out fresh foreign aid.
The Europeans, too — are they living in the real world?
Greece hangs on a precipice, with Europeans debating whether Athens should be allowed to default, which would blow a hole through banks all across Europe. Portugal and Ireland could follow. In the worst case, Spain and Italy fail, entailing a terminal crisis of the EU.
In Athens, anarchists have taken to the streets. Huge protests have erupted in Spain and Britain. How long can the austerity continue among the big debtor nations before social cohesion collapses?
Across the continent, populist parties of the right are rising that seek to retrieve the sovereignty surrendered to transnational institutions by their globalist elites.
Yet Sarkozy and Obama are talking about new foreign aid.
The Wall Street Journal banner June 1 read: “Housing Imperils Recovery: Home Prices Sink to 2002 Levels; Consumer Confidence Falls as Pessimism Grows.”
The lead ran thus: “House prices have sunk to 2002 prices, effectively wiping out almost a decade's worth of home equity across the U.S. and imperiling the fragile economic recovery as Americans confront the falling value of their biggest investment.”
That day, the Dow fell 280 points. And the June 2 Journal banner read: “Economic Outlook Darkens: Markets Stumble as Factories, Hiring Slow Down; Biggest Drop in Stocks in a Year.”
Nearly one-fourth of American homeowners live in houses that are underwater, worth less than the mortgages on them. The index of consumer confidence fell last month from 66 percent to 60.8 percent. Only 38,000 private-sector jobs were created in May. The manufacturing boomlet seems to have stalled. Some 422,000 American workers filed for unemployment benefits in May.
Talk of the “double-dip recession” is now pandemic.
Yet a U.S. government $14.3 trillion in debt, running a third straight deficit of $1.4 trillion, is talking of sending billions in aid to Arab regimes where the deposed despots looted the place.
Nor is America any longer exempt from the anarchic violence plaguing Europe. Over Memorial Day, when millions happily took off for the beach for that first taste of summer, they found trouble.
The Drudge Report headlines the day after Memorial Day tell the story: “Miami ‘War Zone' During Urban Weekend,” “Poet … Gunned Down in Front of Miami Poetry Club,” “Violent Crime Explodes in Myrtle During Black Bike Week; 8-hour Hell,” “Rib Fest at Rochester Beach Turns Rowdy,” “Riot on Long Island,” “Urban Melee in Charlotte,” “Unruly Crowd Shuts Down Nashville Water Park,” “Dozens of Gang Bangers” at Chicago beach.
This is not the peaceful, prosperous America of 1947, with half the world's production, that could cobble together Marshall Plans and ship wealth abroad to rebuild nations devastated by World War II.
Today, America is themselves in need of repair and rebuilding. Yet their leaders are living in yesterday.
Vermont's only Bitcoin ATM is now offline because the state's Department of Financial Regulation claims the operation was violating the local law.
The device was installed back in October 2014 and was available to the general public at the Burlington-based 3D printing store Blu-Bin. The team says the cash mashine was a success amongst the city's tech-savvy community.
However, the store received a letter from the state regulators on January 12th, claiming that the presence of an active cryptocurrency ATM in the establishment was a breach of the law. Another letter was also sent to PYC, the company that owns the device.
According to the document, quoted by the site VPR, Blu-Bin now faces several penalties. “Operation of a Bitcoin ATM in Vermont without a license could result in a monetary penalty of $1,000 per day. Given your October 25th start date, you are already facing an administrative penalty over $75,000,” said the official document.
But there's more: “additionally, knowingly engaging in money services business without a license carries potential criminal penalties of a $10,000.00 fine plus up to three years in prison.”
And although Emilio Pagan-Yourno, CEO of PYC, recognises that the company doesn't have a Vermont license to engage in such services, they remind the authorities that PYC has a federal license issued by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
“According to FinCEN, I do need to have an MSB [Money Services Business] license, which I do for all 50 states and territories. And that's just telling FinCEN that I do provide a service with digital currency according to the new statutes, and Vermont doesn't have that,” explained the entrepreneur.
PYC operates a total of seven Bitcoin ATMs in three different American states: Vermont, New Hampshire and New York. However, Pagan-Yourno says Vermont's authorities are the first (and only) to create obstacles. “I'm not really sure what Vermont's trying to get at, because it's a stretch. And it's funny that they singled me out instead of (similar) companies that have been operating in the state since 2012.”
The problem, according to the CEO of PYC, is that Vermont's regulators don't understand cryptocurrency and how the ATM operates.
They didn't really do their research. And they're trying to target smaller digital currency businesses rather than ones that have already been operating for three years now in Vermont.
The CEO of Blu-Bin agrees. Dan Riley believes that the state regulators do not understand Bitcoin at all, something that was clear when Riley and a PYC representative organized a conference call with the authorities and ended up having to explain from scratch how the system worked.
The license now required by the local authorities costs about $1,500, a value that would render the operation too expensive.
“Obviously we want to comply with any regulatory framework that needs to be complied with. We're not trying to run anything under the table, so to speak. But what we're trying to actually make sure is that this is properly taken care of. Because our understanding has been that the state doesn't really understand where this falls, so they're just trying to shove us into a box that we might not fit into,” Blu-Bin's CEO said.
The regulators might have won the battle as the Bitcoin ATM is offline at the moment, but they are far from winning the war against PYC. Pagan-Yourno said that the regulators are “reaching out for something I don't need”, which means they intend to ignore the official demands. “I'm not entertaining that at all. (…) They can't fine me on something I don't need,” they said.
The state's Department of Financial Regulation has refused to make any comments regarding pending issues.
An excavation at Ham Hill, the largest Iron-Age hill fort in Britain, has revealed more about how the ancient structure was developed by its defenders in response to the Roman invasion.
Researchers have been studying the fort, which covers more than 80 hectares of the Somerset countryside, for the past three years in an attempt to understand more about its function, and how such a large structure was defended by the local population.
The final round of excavations, which are currently being concluded, have focused on its ramparts. In particular the team has concentrated on the final phase of their defensive construction, which occurred towards the end of the Iron Age and was probably a response to the threat posed by the Roman invasion.
This defence consisted of box-revetted stone ramparts, situated on top of previously built, three to four metre-high earthen banks. The existence of these structures does not mean that people in the Iron Age lived in a constant state of warfare; though Ham Hill was clearly prepared to try and repulse attackers, it was not simply a military hill fort. Instead, these ramparts may have been more symbolic than practical, an emblem of defence, the building of which would have helped to foster community spirit and create a collective identity, clearly delineating “us” and “them”.
Despite this, there is obvious evidence of violence and assault in the ramparts – the researchers found defleshed and chopped-up human remains dating back to the time of the Roman Conquest.
Three summers of excavations have provided enormous insight into the previously impenetrable hill fort. Many important and exciting discoveries have been made, such as that of the first “ham stone” house, an Iron Age house built from pieces of local stone. This discovery proved that ham stone was used by builders prior to Roman occupation, and that the Romans were not the first to quarry the site. Other structures found include roundhouses and grain storage pits, dating from the second to first centuries BCE.
Archaeologists have also determined that the hill-top was inhabited from at least Neolithic period up until the time of the Romans, shown from excavated items such as stone implements and early Roman metal items. Early Roman pottery and metalwork have been discovered in the trenches across the ramparts, as have Roman military items, with the latter items in particular suggesting that the Romans garrisoned Ham Hill when initially occupying the South West.
A wide variety of tools and weapons have been unearthed, including a bronze dagger and an iron ballista bolt, as have at least three vessels of Glastonbury Ware pottery. A particularly interesting find has been the Middle Bronze Age ditches used to create a system rectilinear fields and indicating that Ham Hill was full established as a distinct and significant ‘place' by that time (c. 1500 BCE).
Archaeological fieldwork has focused mainly on a large rectangular ditched enclosure within the hill fort's interior; during the course of its excavation, numerous sets of human remains have been discovered, both full skeletons and fragmented bones. The quantity proposes that this enclosure perhaps served as special meeting place for the community, and it has been suggested that the bones were intended to symbolise their ancestors.
Members of the public can see the excavations themselves at an open day on 7 September. Email Hayley Roberts at hr270@cam.ac.uk to arrange a private group tour.

Asian-Americans To Evangelicals: We're Not Your Punch Line
Enlarge this image toggle caption Donna McWilliam/AP Donna McWilliam/AP
"We the undersigned, are distressed about the continuing divide that persists in the North American evangelical church in the area of racial harmony."
That's the first line of a four-page open letter to American Evangelicals ("On Cultural Insensitivity and Reconciliation in the Church") from a coalition called Asian American Christians United. The letter was released earlier this week.
The roughly 700 signatories are a who's who in Asian-American Christian circles: a seminary head, several professors of religion, dozens of pastors, even a few popular bloggers. It was drafted after a few weeks of painful missteps by one of the evangelical community's most prominent members.
Rick Warren is the author of The Purpose-Driven Life: What On Earth Am I Here For?, which stayed on the best-seller list for years. He's also a pastor of the Orange County-based Saddleback Church. Saddleback is considered a crown jewel in the American evangelical diadem and Warren is one of the country's most visible evangelical pastors.
(The first McCain-Obama debate in 2008 was held at Saddleback — a prestigious precedent-breaker, since no modern presidential forum had ever been held in a church.)
Warren has spearheaded outreach to multiple ethnic groups and invited them to join them in the cause of Christ. And he's opening myriad Saddlebacks abroad, to spread the Gospel to what they call a dozen "Gateway Cities" on several continents.
A Problematic Facebook Post
Pastor Warren returned from opening the church's Hong Kong campus last month. Soon after, they posted a photo of a Red Guard, the young Communist cadres that policed their communities during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. The poster showed a smiling, rosy-cheeked young woman in the drab gray uniform the Red Guard typically wore.
Their post (since taken down) said "The typical attitude of Saddleback Staff as they start work each day."
Although the Saddleback pastor said they intended the photo to be a joke, many Asian-American evangelicals were not amused. Many come from Chinese immigrant families, some of which suffered greatly during Mao's Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution that followed. (More than 15 million people are estimated to have died during that Great Leap, from "discipline" administered by the Red Army and from outright starvation, the product of nonsensical agricultural practices that, literally, bore no fruit. Hundreds of thousands more perished during the Cultural Revolution, as Mao's young followers adhered to their instructions to eradicate the taint of Western culture and values that were anathema to Chinese Communism.)
The Joke That Launched A Letter
Warren's initial response on their Facebook page was to tell readers that sometimes people on the Internet didn't get irony: "It's a joke people! If you take this seriously, you really shouldn't be following me!" That, in turn, was followed by what many consider to be a pro forma apology.
But a few weeks later, Warren spoke at a conference that featured a video in which a white pastor talked in a fake Asian accent, and engaged in goofy Karate with another character, replete with bows, and tinny "Asian" music.
That was too much for many Asian-American Christians. Hence, the letter.
"Over the past decade," it pointed out, "Christian evangelicalism has been the source of repeated and offensive racial stereotyping, and Asian Americans have been inordinately affected... Asians have been caricatured, mocked or otherwise treated as foreigners outside the typical accepted realm of white [evangelicals]. And the situation has not improved over time."
In fact, the letter cites about a half-dozen offenses in recent years. And it points out these are only the incidents that have been highlighted by the media. For every one of those, the writers believe, there may be myriad others that never capture the public's attention.
Some of the letter's signatories were as (or perhaps more) disturbed by the reactions they encountered when they expressed offense.
"Get A Sense Of Humor"
Kathy Khang, a minister and the author of More Than Serving Tea: Asian American Women on Expectations, Relationships, Leadership and Faith, wrote to Warren, saying their apology was about as offensive as the initial mistake. Khang asked Warren to "please reconsider your comments that essentially told many of your brothers and sisters in Christ to get over it, to get a sense of humor, to lighten up, etc....because you don't get to tell me to laugh about the Communist Red Guard, because it isn't funny."
Comments like that struck home. Warren ultimately pulled the offending Maoist illustration and posted a longer apology:
"If you were hurt, upset, offended or distressed by my insensitivity I am truly sorry," they wrote. "May God richly bless you."
The point of the letter, according to many of the people who signed it, is to begin a much-needed, long-delayed dialogue within the evangelical church. And to acknowledge that although they are all one Christian family, Asian-American evangelicals are feeling a lot like unloved step-children at the moment.
Crow Prevention Invention! Published on February 04, 2013 by Henny Penny in Penny's Posts
I was so annoyed by the cheeky crows pinching my fresh eggs while they were still warm that I decided to come up with something to deter them. I know scarecrows have been in existence for centuries, but I didn't have the items to hand or the time to build one of those. Instead I tied a long piece of 'cling-wrap' (the kind used in warehouses and factories to wrap things up prior to shipping) on one of the fence posts next to my hen house.
It's pretty exposed where we live so relying on the wind to blow is a fairly safe bet. And boy has it been windy of late, especially since the snow has gone. The cling-wrap has been doing its thing, flapping about like mad and making a nicely erratic noise into the bargain. Fingers crossed this does seem to have deterred the crows - I've only seen them there once over the past 3 days. Obviously on those rare days when there's no wind it's not going to work, but as we're still in winter I would expect it to be of some use most days for the next few months.
Anyway, I'm watching it carefully to see if it continues to deter these pests. My chickens don't seem to mind it at all, so that's not a problem. If you fancy trying something like this yourself and don't have access to any cling-wrap, you could simply cut some black bin bags or old supermarket bags into long strips and tie them together. This will create a long strip of light material which will blow about and make some noise.
Please post a comment to let me know how you get on, or any other suggestions that work well for you. And finally, don't forget to tie them together tightly as we certainly don't want to litter the countryside with carrier bags!

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton launched a bid on Thursday to draw young voters and small donors to their campaign, targeting the strengths of their rival, Bernie Sanders, as they look ahead to the general election.

Dubbed “for45” - for Clinton as the 45th president of the United States - the group will offer associate level membership for as low as $250, according to an invitation seen by Reuters for an April 25 Philadelphia event.
“We will have an opportunity to fundraise and host low-dollar events, speaking to what we are passionate about and why we support her,” said Akilah Ensley, a 32-year-old Clinton supporter planning to join the group. “It's important that we engage.”
The group held its “kick-off” conference call on Thursday, featuring the Clinton campaign's finance director, Dennis Cheng, other campaign officials, and actor Lena Dunham, according to an invitation to the call.
The group includes two other tiers, according to an information sheet seen by Reuters - a “member” level with minimum fundraising of $2,500 and an “advisor” level for raising at least $10,000.
The Clinton and Sanders campaigns did not respond to requests for comment.
The formation of the group underscores the challenge facing the former secretary of state in winning over the young people who have helped power Sanders' run. Younger voters are a critical voting block and source of financing should they win the Democratic nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election.
Clinton has a commanding delegate lead over Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, and checked their momentum by winning New York's primary earlier this week.
But they have struggled to attract younger voters. While they won New York on Tuesday by 16 points, Sanders took 65 percent of Democratic voters aged 18 to 29, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research and published in the New York Times. Younger voters have also turned out more heavily for Sanders in other states.
Sanders so often boasts about their average donation level of $27 that rally crowds now shout the number out along with him.
Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist in Florida who is not affiliated with the Clinton campaign, said for45 was a “smart way” to begin courting Sanders' supporters. They compared it with the “Gen44” group of young voters that supported President Barack Obama.
“Anything that spurs people to get involved financially, it just builds more ownership in the campaign,” they said.
HACKENSACK — A 23-year-old Paramus man has been arrested for allegedly engaging in "inappropriate sexual activity" with a young girl two years ago.
Anthony Yachouh was taken into custody on Thursday, after an investigation by the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office and the Paramus Police Department, authorities said.
The state's Division of Child Protection and Permanency first learned of the alleged abuse against the girl, who is now 8 years old, according to Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Molinelli.
"The incident is alleged to have occurred about two years ago when the victim was 5 or 6 years old but only just reported," they said in a statement.
Yachouh, who is unemployed, is charged with sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child.
 They are being held at the Bergen County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail, and has been ordered to have no contact with their alleged victim.
“Counter-Strike” won the hearts of a generation when the first-person shooter game series released its first game 16 years ago.
Over a decade later, people are still playing that game. Not just playing – it has evolved with time to become one of the most dominant eSports titles on the market today. Even though “Counter-Strike” has existed a long time, at UCLA this is the first year the game has had an official club standing on campus. Similar to the “Defense of the Ancients,” or “DotA,” group, the “Counter-Strike” club on campus is in its first year as an organization, fielding its own successful Collegiate StarLeague team.
First-person shooter, or FPS, games have been traditionally understood as the most popular video game genre for American audiences. Today, “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive,” or just “Counter-Strike,” is the predominant FPS game being played competitively. While other games like those of the “Call of Duty” series do have successful eSports scenes, “Counter-Strike” is the premier game in the US. As such, the Collegiate StarLeague established its inaugural “Counter-Strike” league this year.
Back in 2008, Major League Gaming was the first to develop the American eSports scene with “Halo,” the very popular Microsoft sci-fi FPS franchise, while rival eSports organization Championship Gaming Series chose to feature “Counter-Strike” as its FPS of choice. Prior to these events, eSports as a whole was largely relegated to Asian audiences that watched strategy games like “Starcraft,” or European events in other shooter games like “Quake.” In 2016, Major League Gaming, which was recently purchased by Activision, will be hosting the first ever CS Major international tournament in North America. There are currently over a half a million daily “Counter-Strike” players, and their community only continues increasing in size.
“Counter-Strike's” reclaiming of its throne as top FPS can be attributed to a myriad of different sources. “Global Offensive,” the game's latest iteration, continues to receive lots of community-driven updates from its developer, Valve. However, the most noteworthy thing about “Counter-Strike” is the third-party gambling scene. Websites like CSGO Lounge or EZ Skins have created a virtual gambling economy in which users can place bets with their in-game items as if they were at a sportsbook in Las Vegas.
Currently, one can only bet on professional matches but it is only a matter of time before betting is extended to collegiate leagues. When this happens, the books should hold UCLA's team as one of the favorites. They are currently boasting an 8-1 season record in the Collegiate StarLeague , proving to be strongest of all the teams representing UCLA in collegiate eSports.
William Jeong, a fourth-year history student, attributes the success of the team to they put in as a team.
“We aren't all spectacular individual players, so the key to success is regimented practice and lots of trust in each other,” said Jeong.  They are not only a staple of the team roster, but also the president UCLA's “Counter-Strike” club.
While the “Counter-Strike” club on campus is still relatively small compared to the behemoth that is the “League of Legends” club, the students involved are dedicated to the game's growth here. Their dominating performance online only mirrors the drive they have for pushing this classic game to prominence on campus.
Two men were injured after a shooting in North Braddock late Saturday, and police say they suspect a bar patron who had been asked to leave the establishment is to blame. Officials said officers went to Crud's Bar at Brinton Avenue and Sheridan Street after a call came in about a shooting there. The officers found two men suffering from gunshot wounds.

Story highlights Jessica Simpson confirms their pregnancy
There is speculation that Jessica Simpson may be pregnant, but not much buzz
Simpson has been spotted around town rubbing a protruding belly
It seems that in recent years, Hollywood has been "baby crazy," and celebrity followers have flocked to entertainment shows, websites and magazines with a voracious hunger to get the latest news on which stars are expecting a visit from the stork.
Gossip columns relish in playing the "Is they or isn't she?" game. Magazines engage in fierce bidding wars to run the first photos of a new celebrity baby. Celeb kids such as Violet Affleck, Suri Cruise and Kingston Rossdale often get as much, if not more, press as their famous parents. Baby bumps and due dates are increasingly popular topics of conversation on the red carpet.
You've seen the names in recent headlines -- Benicio Del Toro, Mariska Hargitay and, most recently, Bruce Willis -- but one celebrity has been slightly ignored in the realm of celebrity baby watchers: Jessica Simpson.
Rumor has it that the singer/actor/reality show star/fashion designer is pregnant with their first child with their fiancé, former NFL player Eric Johnson. But, besides from some idle speculation, not much has been made of the blessed event -- well, except for some jokes at Jess' expense.
They have been seen strolling around with a rotund tummy, most recently holding hands with Johnson while rubbing said belly . On Monday tweeted confirmation that they are pregnant by posing in a mummy costume and cradling their belly with the words "It's true -- I"m going to be a mummy!"
Despite the added tidbit that Simpson's ex Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo recently announced at a local event that "I actually have one on the way" with their wife, the interest in a Simpson's pregnancy seems decidedly muted.
According to outlets like the New York Post, Simpson's father/manager, Joe, hasn't even been successful in getting the media to bite. Stories are circulating that they have been trying to sell the story of the alleged pregnancy (and, of course the first mama/baby photos) to the tabloids, possibly because their daughter has been seen about town sporting what appears to be a rather obvious baby bump. So why aren't the celebrity-driven media going ga-ga about this star mama?
You could try to attribute the lack of interest about the future baby boy or baby girl Simpson to some sort of collective "baby fatigue," but that theory doesn't stand up to the hoopla that surrounded the first public appearance of Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon's twin babies, Moroccan and Monroe (accompanied by not only a "20/20" interview with Barbara Walters but a week's worth of teasers showing just the backs of their heads). We'd like to offer a couple of theories as to why the entertainment industry and fans are generally apathetic to the Simpson pregnancy:
The Maury defense: We know who the father is
When actores fail to disclose the name of the child's father, we become all the more curious about the offspring. Take the recent case of "Mad Men" star January Jones. A number of actors have been fingered as potential fathers of Jones' son, Xander.
The mystery daddy isn't a new phenomenon. Remember when Melissa Etheridge and their then-girlfriend enlisted the services of an undisclosed sperm donor to father their children, only to get even more attention when it was revealed that the donor in question was legendary rocker David Crosby? Johnson has been the only man in Jessica's life for quite a while, and there's no doubt as to paternity. If Simpson had been seen around town with maybe a former flame like John Mayer or even the asupervisorstioned Romo, they could have gotten some tongues wagging.
Scandal? What scandal? Exactly.
It may boil down to a lack of interest in Simpson as a headline-grabbing celebrity.
Many women, myself included, would say she's got an impressive line of shoes, but as of late, they haven't done much of note -- either famously or infamously. They haven't had a hit single in quite a while. Them films have been largely straight-to-video flops ("Major Movie Star" or "Blonde Ambition," anyone?) and she's not been able to replicate their success in the reality TV genre after the demise of "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica" ("The Price of Beauty" on VH1 just didn't cut it).
Poor Jess can't even register much of a blip in the scandal sheets. Them the biggest scandal in the past few years revolves around their questionable taste in pants (the infamous "Mom Jeans" incident of 2009). Them upcoming reality project, "Fashion Star," could get them back in the headlines, but we suggest a Demi Moore-esque nude pregnancy photo shoot to get a little tabloid love.
The name game
Maybe we just have to wait until Simpson gives birth to draw some attention to their imminent motherhood. The announcement of celebrity baby names is quite a big deal in the entertainment press, especially when the chosen name isn't one you're likely to hear on the playground any time soon, like Jason Lee's son Pilot Inspektor or Nicolas Cage's son Kal-El. If Simpson wants some guaranteed media attention, they could name their kid Chicken C. Simpson.
It's no secret; millions of people have babies every day. But, it's slightly ironic that a woman whose first marriage and divorce we watched faithfully on the boob tube has lost the audience for the possible birth of their first child. Regardless if anyone outside their immediate family cares, since she's due for a blessed event, that should be their top priority -- headline or no headline.
The details of the Liberal government's special committee on electoral reform were revealed Tuesday evening, kicking off an eagerly anticipated and controversial process to change the way Canadians vote.
A long motion on Wednesday's notice paper from Democratic Institutions Minister Maryam Monsef shows that the committee will be composed of ten members chosen by their respective party whips no later than 10 days after the adoption of the motion.
Six will be from the Liberal party, three from the Conservative Party, and one member from the NDP.
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, and a member from the Bloc, will also be on the committee, but neither will have the right to vote nor move any motion.
The order paper motion says the committee will “conduct a study of viable alternate voting systems, such as preferential ballots and proportional representation, to replace the first-past-the-post system, as well as…examine mandatory voting and online voting.”
Its final report is due no later than December 1, 2016 and is expected to assess the extent to which options identified can advance certain principles.
Those include: effectiveness and legitimacy; engagement; accessibility and inclusiveness; integrity; and local representation.
The committee will also be directed to issue an invitation to each MP to conduct a town hall in their respective constituencies and provide the committee with a written report of the input from their constituents.
That is to be filed with the clerk of the committee no later than October 1, 2016.
The committee will be granted all of the powers of a standing committee, the motion clarifies, and will be given the power to travel, accompanied by the necessary staff, inside and outside of Canada.
It's expected to “consult broadly with relevant experts and organizations, take into consideration consultations that have been undertaken on the issue, examine relevant research studies and literature, and review models being used or developed in other jurisdictions.”
It will also have the power to authorize video and audio broadcasting of any or all of its proceedings.
On Wednesday morning Monsef and Liberal House Leader Dominic LeBlanc are holding a press conference in the National Press Theatre in Ottawa to make an official announcement.
“As Canadians, we care about our democratic way of life. Our democracy has deep roots — but we know we must keep improving. Our government is determined to meet our commitment that 2015 was the last election to use a First Past the Post system. Canadians deserve better,” Monsef said in a statement Tuesday evening.
“We are launching this national dialogue to bridge the gulf between citizens and their representatives. It's time to remind Canadians that they are in charge. Modernizing our voting system will provide all of us with an opportunity to participate more fully in shaping our country.”
Last year, we launched a successful Kickstarter for our XLP / iXLP Dice. We originally created this concept as an updated, modern version of traditional pip dice, using extra large pips instead.
We were so overwhelmed by the positive feedback that we couldn't wait to create an even better version. We made small tweaks to the design and inverted the colors, creating a much more polished and contrasted look. We've also changed our dice size to a standard 16mm.
New - Reverse color option is now available!
Our dice are machined from solid aircraft grade aluminum, using a multi-step process. The raw material is made into cubes and the edges are rounded for a sleeker look and smoother roll. Next, the rounded cubes are anodized, resulting in a bright, even-colored coating. Finally, we machine the faces, unveiling the natural aluminum with our cuts, for a beautifully contrasted finish.
Our ultimate goal is to see our dice in stores around the world! During this past year, we've made huge strides toward that goal. We've lined up a professional machine shop which will not only enable us to produce our dice faster, but allow us to use much higher caliber machines to create the best product possible. We have manufacturing and distribution ready to go, we just need your help to get our first production run off the ground!
During our original Kickstarter, we introduced two different design options: XLP (extra large pips) and iXLP (an inverted version of the XLP design). Each style has been independently redesigned and we're excited to be able to offer both options throughout this Kickstarter as well!
v1.0 vs v2.0
Each design will be available in your choice of black, blue or red anodized aluminum. We have many other colors lined up as stretch goals, starting with green, grey and purple. With your help, we'll be able to release even more!

McCain criticizes Trump's Syria policy despite cancer diagnosis
CLOSE A cancer diagnosis hasn't stopped Senator John McCain from blasting President Trump. McCain slammed President Trump's administration for deciding to halt a CIA training program for moderate Syrian rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad's regime. USA TODAY
Cancer isn't keeping Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., from sticking to their political guns.
Just hours after news broke of McCain's brain cancer diagnosis, the Arizona senator blasted President Trump amid a report that the administration decided to halt a CIA training program for moderate Syrian rebels fighting Bashar al-Assad's regime.
"If these reports are true, the administration is playing right into the hands of Vladimir Putin," McCain said in a statement Thursday. "Making any concession to Russia, absent a broader strategy for Syria, is irresponsible and short-sighted."

The program began under the Obama administration in 2013, and Trump decided to end it about a month ago, The Washington Post reported.
McCain also criticized Trump for not having a broader strategy in Syria and the Middle East in general. "There is still no new strategy for victory in Afghanistan either. It is now mid-July, when the administration promised to deliver that strategy to Congress, and we are still waiting," they added.
McCain announced Wednesday night that they had been diagnosed with a brain tumor after a minor surgery to remove a blood clot above their left eye revealed the glioblastoma.
On Thursday morning, McCain vowed to return to Congress soon. "I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support," they said in a tweet.

Let's talk about black market beer
The most-trafficked article on this entire site is titled “Where Can I Buy Heady Topper in New York City?“ Thousands of people come to this site every month wanting to know where they can get the double IPA brewed by a small Vermont outfit called The Alchemist – a beer that is consistently ranked among the best beers in the world by beer-rating websites. There's a simple answer to that question in the article: you can't. But that's not entirely honest of us: you can. We won't tell you where, because we don't want to encourage the type of activity that allows it to be purchased in the city. The black-market selling of this beer and others is blatantly illegal, goes against the wishes of the brewer, and drives up the scarcity of the beer in places where the sale is legal thanks to hoarders trying to make a buck.
The law is quite clear: any beer not registered for sale in the state of New York cannot be sold by a retailer here legally. While Heady Topper was registered for sale back in 2012, when they shipped a small amount of the beer in New York, the registration has since lapsed, because they shrank their distribution footprint. Even with a closure of the brewery's tasting room and an expansion, The Alchemist simply cannot keep up with demand in their home market of Vermont. Heck, the popularity of the beer at home is almost too much to bear. People still line up at liquor stores on the day each week that Heady Topper arrives, and their regular “truck sales” had to be discontinued due to crowd and parking complaints in their hometown of Waterbury. Many of the people buying their beer are buying it because they want to enjoy it, or share with friends. But there are more than a handful who want to profit off of the beer's popularity and scarcity, and a few are doing it unabashedly.
Take the photo above, provided to us by a longtime reader who came across Heady Topper on a beer menu at a bar in Brooklyn for an insane price. Perhaps you think that $17 is a price you're willing to pay for this beer, but consider that in a worst-case scenario, this bar paid the retail price of $2.50 per can and is adding an outrageous 580% markup. That markup is figuratively criminal, but the sale of it in New York is literally criminal. Back in 2009, an Upper East Side bar was raided and fined $20,000 for selling unregistered beer. A similar fate is the risk of selling Heady Topper. But the massive markup is the reward.
Let's also consider that without a lot of publicity and a pricetag that high, we doubt those cans of Heady are moving very fast. And since the beer isn't delivered on a refrigerated truck straight from the brewery, we doubt these cans are being served the way the brewer intends the beer to be served. The Alchemist's John Kimmich has regularly vented about retailers who improperly and illegally sell their beer, saying, “we work unbelievably hard to put out a world class beer at a very affordable and reasonable price.” $17 for a can of questionable freshness is not affordable or reasonable.
New York's Craigslist is often littered with posts advertising Heady Topper at absurd prices. This practice is against Craigslist policy, and is also illegal. In 2013, a Vermont lawyer was busted for selling five cases of the beer through Craigslist for a whopping $825. While prosecutions are rare, resellers are taking a risk – and again, going against the wishes of the brewer.
So, how do you get your hands on a beer like Heady Topper? If you're looking for the real deal, go to Vermont. Or, make a beer trade with someone who's been to Vermont. Or, chip in on a case with someone you know who's going to Vermont. Any other way is illegal and likely a waste of your hard-earned money.
But here's the thing: you don't need to go to Vermont to get a beer like Heady Topper. There are plenty of double IPAs out there that are far more widely available in New York – and some says are better. The annual release of Bell's Hopslam didn't require a full-on beer hunt around the city. Stone's Enjoy By series and Lagunitas Sucks come to New York regularly. And Other Half Green Diamonds won a blind IPA tasting we held over the weekend – and when it's available, it retails at the brewery for $16 for a four-pack of freshly-filled cans.
Sure beats $17 for one lousy can that rode in someone's trunk from Vermont.
Player from team of political rivals felled after Evo Morales retaliates for late tackle during a friendly
A knee to the groin may be more Vinnie Jones than Machiavelli, but it was no less effective for Evo Morales in asserting their presidential authority.
With one deft movement, Bolivia's combative leader felled an opponent in a football match against a team of political rivals. The receiving player crumpled in agony holding, as local media put it, their "testicular zone".
The incident, during a match on Sunday to inaugurate a renovated stadium in the capital La Paz, was captured on video and last night aired on local TV stations and was uploaded to YouTube.
The friendly match started when, wearing a No 10 green jersey, Morales, a football fanatic and Bolivia's first indigenous president, led their team of bodyguards and officials on to the artificial pitch.
The yellow team was led by Luis Revilla, mayor of La Paz and a political ally turned foe of the president. After smiles and handshakes the game began. Within five minutes Daniel Gustavo Cartagena, in the No 2 jersey for the mayor's team, scythed into the president after they passed the ball, gashing their right leg.
Morales, 50, a former Aymara llama herder and coca farmer, is not known for indulging critics, let alone people who foul him. They walked up to Cartagena, indicated their wound, then kneed them in the groin. The player collapsed, prompting audible whistles from spectators.
The match swiftly deteriorated into a bad-tempered, foul-filled contest which arguably mirrored the Andean country's combative politics. By the end, the match drawn at 4-4, two players from each side had been sent off, including Cartagena and one of the president's bodyguards.
One bodyguard tried to arrest Cartagena after the final whistle, the newspaper La Razón reported, but they were released after Revilla intervened.
Morales denied ordering the arrest but was unrepentant about their response to Cartagena's foul. "I passed the ball and suddenly I received a hammering. It's not the first time it happened," the president told reporters hours later.
Revilla also played down the incident, saying: "This was a football game and on the field we are all players." It was not clear if Cartagena was a member of the mayor's political party, Movement Without Fear.
A medical bulletin from the presidential palace said Morales received a laceration on the inside of the right leg and that a doctor recommended three to four days' rest.
As a young man, Morales's passion on the field for a union of coca-growers' team helped them become union president, launching their political career. Since their 2005 election as the head of the Movement Towards Socialism, which has empowered Bolivia's indigenous people and forged leftist policies, they have become a reserve player for Litoral, an amateur second-division squad.
The leader also hosted a charity match with the former Argentinian player Diego Maradona in La Paz, at 3,597 metres (11,800ft) above sea level, to protest a Fifa ban on games above a certain altitude.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Engineers proud of 'state-of-the-art' bridge
The new £1.35bn Queensferry Crossing could still be operating in 150 years, according to its technical director.
Mike Glover, who has managed the bridge project for the decade since it was first approved, told the BBC its design would make it easy to maintain.
The new 1.7 miles (2.7km) crossing over the river Forth will open to traffic for the first time on Wednesday.
It will take most of the vehicles that currently travel over the 53-year-old Forth Road Bridge.
The existing suspension bridge will be adapted to be used by lighter traffic such as cycles, pedestrians and public transport.
Mr Glover told the BBC Radio Four documentary Gordon Goes Forth that despite the Forth Road Bridge being replaced because of issues about its safety and reliability, it could last another 50 years if it was properly maintained.
Opening the Queensferry Crossing
Image copyright PA Image caption The new crossing will open to traffic for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 30 August
In the early hours of the morning, the Queensferry Crossing will fully open to traffic in both directions.
Police will put in a place a rolling roadblock to stop traffic driving across the Forth Road Bridge and will redirect them across the Queensferry Crossing.
The northbound carriageway will be opened first. The southbound carriageway will be opened about 45 minutes later.
The bridge will be fully open to traffic for the rest of the day and the following day.
Friday 1 September
Early in the morning, the Queensferry Crossing will close to all traffic.
Police will redirect all vehicles back across the Forth Road Bridge.
It will remain closed until the early hours of Wednesday morning.
Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 September
About 50,000 members of the public, who were given tickets after a ballot, will get a "once in a lifetime" chance to walk over the new bridge on Saturday and Sunday.
Monday 4 September
The Queen will officially open the Queensferry Crossing. They will be joined by the Duke of Edinburgh.
The Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland will bless the bridge, and the Queen will cut a ribbon on the south side.
Tuesday 5 September
A chance for a further 10,000 local people and school children to walk the bridge.
Thursday 7 September
The bridge will re-open to traffic, with no pedestrian access.
The initial speed limit will be 40mph but after work has been completed to adapt the Forth Road Bridge public transport will be switched back to the old bridge and the Queensferry Crossing will become a 70 mph motorway.
Heavy loads
The current Forth Road Bridge opened in 1964 but a serious problem was found with corrosion of the wires inside its cables not long after its 40th birthday.
The corrosion meant that the bridge's cables had already lost about 10% of their strength and it was forecast that it might not be able to take the heavy loads for much more than a decade.
The decision to replace it was taken in 2007, with construction of the new crossing beginning in September 2011.
Mr Glover, who has been the technical director of the Queensferry Crossing since 2007, calls it a "world class bridge" which will be around well into the 22nd Century.
They said: "The length of time this bridge will be in position will be well in excess of 120 years - 150 years."
The civil engineer said there were two main reasons for predicting such longevity.
"The first is that the exterior of the bridge is a continuous structure - it is a box - which means the level of maintenance that is required is very minimal, unlike the trusses on the current suspension bridge," Mr Glover said.
"The second is because the individual cables that make up the cable-stay bridge each one can be replaced without the stability of the bridge being in doubt.
"Whereas with the suspension bridge any problem with that suspension cable means that the bridge would have to be closed."
Despite the problems with the existing Forth Road Bridge, Mr Glover predicted it could survive for another 50 years now that it would be carrying lighter loads.
They say: "It does require the maintenance regime to be maintained but with modern instrumentation we will know where to look for issues."
The documentary Gordon goes Forth, presented by Gordon Brown, will be on BBC Radio Four at 20:00 on Monday 28 August.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Hackers made a “very powerful” attack on the Kremlin website on Sunday, the Russian government said on Monday.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov linked the attack to regional elections in Russia on Sunday in which the opposition sought to challenge government-allied politicians in the one region it was allowed to run.
Peskov said the election commission's website came under attack on Sunday morning.
“Given that, you will certainly be interested to know that from 5 to 10 am on Sunday a very powerful attack was simultaneously carried out on the Russian president's website,” Peskov told reporters.
“Defense systems worked though it was not easy, the attack was rather strong,” they said.
They said had no information on who might have been behind the attack.
Russia has a hacking criminal underground and the United States regularly accuses Russian, as well as Chinese, hackers of attacks.
Experts say Russian government-backed hackers target U.S. government computers as well as help spread Moscow propaganda at a time of dire relations between Kremlin and the West over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, human rights and other issues.
In advance of March 9, the start of free agency in the NFL, Pro Football Rumors will detail each team's three most glaring roster issues. We'll continue this year's series with the Oakland Raiders, who ended a 13-season playoff drought by going 12-4 and advancing to the AFC bracket. A historically ill-timed injury to Derek Carr spoiled the Raiders' realistic chances at making a postseason run, but the team is well-positioned to be a factor for years to come. Whether they're going to be identified with Oakland or Las Vegas, the Raiders have the pieces to be considered one of the AFC favorites in 2017.

Must exercise or decline fifth-year option for LB Khalil Mack
Three Needs:
1.) Address the defensive interior: Extensions for Derek Carr and, eventually, Khalil Mack will begin to affect the Raiders' offseason spending after years of the team's payroll being devoid of homegrown re-ups. But if they were going to make a big outside investment at a position this year, interior defensive line would be a key spot to target. Oakland actually entered training camp in fairly good shape here, but enduring the ignominy of finishing a season with a league-worst 25 sacks despite having a possible defensive player of the year leading that charge will force Reggie McKenzie into addressing this area. Mack and Bruce Irvin delivered 18 of those 25 sacks and give the Raiders their best set of bookend pass-rushers since Howie Long and Greg Townsend during their early Los Angeles days. But they don't have a lot of help right now.
Mario Edwards remains an intriguing prospect, but this latest injury — a hip malady that sidelined them for 14 regular-season games after they were initially expected to be shelved for merely a few — showed durability will likely be an issue. He's now missed 16 games in two years. The Raiders can't count on them to be the top interior presence they were in 2015, when they graded out as a top-10 run-stopper among edge defenders (per Pro Football Focus). Edwards is the Raiders' best holdover interior rusher and when available solves multiple problems for a defense that ranked 23rd against ground attacks, but Oakland needs help here.
Its investment in Jihad Ward did not reveal a piece ready to make an impact, with the raw second-rounder recording no sacks in 13 starts. PFF tabbed the Illinois product as its worst interior defender. Denico Autry profiles as a backup at best. Stacy McGee finished with 2.5 sacks to lead the uninspiring supporting cast, and he's a UFA. Oakland uses both 4-3 and 3-4 looks, with new defensive assistant John Pagano likely to implement additional usage of the latter alignment, and has run-stopping DTs Dan Williams and Justin Ellis under contract for 2017. Neither is a high-end option, and Williams' $4.5MM cap number can be shed entirely to gain more space if the Raiders so choose. But the team will need some incumbents to supplement whatever talent is acquired. However, as the only non-rookie-deal player in this mix, Williams looms as a release candidate.
An issue in upgrading on the D-line could be a lack of realistic options to make any kind of real impact on the UFA market. Kawann Short is unlikely to leave Carolina, and if Calais Campbell manages to make it to the market, they will be seeking a major payday. The 30-year-old dynamo would obviously be a fit, but given the current level at which he's playing, Campbell could command $10MM per year or close to it on a medium-length deal. That would be a pursuit McKenzie would be wise to be involved in, but again, the Cardinals — who have spent to retain their homegrown defenders — would have to pass on them before the new league year commences. Nick Fairley capitalized on their prove-it deal with the Saints and could have a robust market for their services. Fairley's career-high 6.5 sacks gave the former first-rounder three seasons of at least 5.5 takdeowns. While he's not known as being a particularly formidable run-defending presence, the 29-year-old would provide a major upgrade as an inside pass-rusher. They would prefer to stay in New Orleans but may like what they encounter on the market if they make it back to free agency.
Beyond Campbell and Fairley, players like former Raider Vance Walker — who is coming off a torn ACL but was productive in 2015 for the Broncos as an off-the-bench pass-rusher — and Alan Branch would represent some mid-tier stopgap avenues. The Titans' Karl Klug also profiles as an under-the-radar buy and would fit as a three-technique rusher the Raiders covet.
ESPN.com's Mel Kiper Jr. has the Raiders taking Michigan State defensive tackle Malik McDowell in the first round of their initial mock draft (ESPN Insider link). Florida's Caleb Brantley also could be available when the Raiders pick at 24, but with this position generally flooding first rounds in the recent past, it's difficult to see a gap between Jonathan Allen — expected to go in the top five — and these talents existing in time for the Raiders to potentially choose between them. One of them might still be around by the time the Raiders are on the clock, however. McDowell is a proven disruptive presence who, while not being the most productive sacker (7.5 in three seasons in East Lansing), would add much-needed young talent to the Raiders' rotation. If they wanted to wait until Day 2 to address this need, players like Chris Wormley (Michigan) and Jaleel Johnson (Iowa) showed ability to beat Big Ten offensive linemen, registering 5.5 and 7.5 sacks, respectively, in 2016.
2.) Find answers at non-rush linebacker: For the first time in years, a batch of glaring needs aren't staring down the Raiders. But both of Oakland's three-down linebackers are UFAs. The team also must balance how it approaches this position due to the financial issues that are set to enter into play. Irvin is already signed through 2019 to a top-market deal for 4-3 outside linebackers — even if their responsibilities are closer to a 3-4 edge player's. A potential record-breaking extension for Mack is coming as well, so Oakland will need to be mindful of how much it contributes to its non-rush linebacker spots. But these positions certainly present a noticeable short-term need, with Malcolm Smith and Perry Riley being UFAs.
Riley came in midseason and proved to be a vital fixture for a team that could not find an answer at middle linebacker. Recent draft picks Ben Heeney and Cory James could not stick there, either due to injury or present talent level, and after an October signing, Riley finished the season as Pro Football Focus' No. 15 non-rush linebacker. Their career profile resembles that of David Amerson, being a Redskins castoff who found a spot to revive their career in Oakland. Riley, though, will turn 29 this offseason. It's unlikely both Riley and Smith return, as the Raiders' defense (No. 23 in DVOA) was not talented enough for a run-it-back scenario here — especially given what it would cost to retain both — so a setup where the team finds a linebacker in free agency and one with a high draft pick makes sense. A mid-term Riley pact could be a solid low-cost option if the Raiders are intent on preserving some capital.
Heeney, James and Neiron Ball still factor into the equation, but none of the trio has given indications he's the answer as a three-down linebacker thus far. The priority should be finding players who can contribute on passing downs, when Irvin and Mack move to defensive end. Oakland owns its lowest pick since 2003, but traditional linebackers can be added without upper-first-round selections.
Oakland won't be able to realistically target Alabama's Reuben Foster, but could be in position to add Vanderbilt's Zach Cunningham (125 tackles, 16.5 for loss, in 2016) with its No. 24 pick. Ohio State's Raekwon McMillan (back-to-back 100-tackle seasons) and Northwestern's Anthony Walker (29 tackles for loss in the 2015 and '16 seasons) also qualify as options if the Raiders want to take an inside ‘backer in Round 1. This would be drafting for need, and given the ability to find ILBs down the draft board, such a tactic may not be the best use of a first-rounder.
If the Raiders pass on this position in the first round, they will need to address it at some point in their next few selection windows, because it's unlikely they're adding two veterans to fill the current vacancies, not when they could soon be the rare club with two $20MM-per-year players. The team hasn't deployed a long-term presence at inside ‘backer since Kirk Morrison in the late 2000s, so infusing the defense with a high-level prospect to go along with Mack, Irvin and Karl Joseph makes sense as a foundation-setting move. Then again, is inside linebacker worth a foundation pick? Depends on the organization's viewpoint.
As far as free agency goes, it's not a special crop. Dont'a Hightower likely won't make it to the market, and Lawrence Timmons could be eyeing a big third contract surpassing recent 30-plus linebackers like Derrick Johnson or David Harris. Johnson signed for $7MM AAV last year, and Timmons is nearly three years younger. Zach Brown, Kevin Minter and Manti Te'o are lesser-known options. Brown will undoubtedly seek a raise after signing a one-year deal with the Bills for $1.125MM last spring, but with 149 tackles this season and plus coverage skills, the 27-year-old ‘backer is someone who fits the profile of a UFA target. Te'o now becomes a more realistic option due to their history with Pagano, although he's coming off injury and an inconsistent four years in San Diego.
3.) Add a third receiving option: The Raiders' offense powered them into the playoffs, but it did stall at some inopportune times — both Chiefs contests being a prime example — even with Carr in the fold. Oakland has needs at tackle and in the secondary, but the team may consider making a move to add a third pass-catching weapon.
Neither the auxiliary receivers nor the tight ends did enough for the Raiders this season. Seth Roberts may be better suited as a No. 4 target, their penchant for clutch TD grabs notwithstanding. The top slot man eclipsed 40 yards in just two games and saw their yards-per-catch figure drop from 15.0 (480 total yards) in 2015 to 10.4 (397) in '16. This is understandable given Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree comprising one of the league's premier receiving tandems, but that duo could use more assistance. Oakland also did not receive much from its tight ends. Second-year man Clive Walford totaled fewer than 350 receiving yards for a second straight season despite seeing more time, and Mychal Rivera will likely not be retained as a UFA. There is room for an addition here, but it will have to be on a budget.
Their present top-heavy financial arrangement at the position, as well as the asupervisorstioned needs, may preclude the Raiders from spending much here. But they might have some low-cost options in free agency before likely using at least one draft choice on a wideout. Kendall Wright and Jeremy Kerley profile as two UFA buy-low candidates.
Wright, 27, is coming off two down years, but the former first-round Titans pick did put together a 1,000-yard season in 2013. With two entrenched receivers outside, Wright would be clearly the third option — and given their current stock could fall into the Raiders' price range. They haven't played in an upper-echelon offense or with a high-caliber quarterback. Considering their marginalization in Tennessee's run-heavy attack in 2016, there could be some untapped potential for the former Baylor standout who seems to know he's done in Nashville.
Kerley has put up reasonable numbers with poor quarterbacks for most of their career, save for a 2015 season during which they fell out of favor in Chan Gailey‘s then-potent Jets offense. They exceeded 800 receiving yards with Mark Sanchez in 2012 and surpassed 600 while equipped with Colin Kaepernick and Blaine Gabbert this season. At 28 and as a lesser-regarded talent, Kerley should be available for less than Wright. Should Markus Wheaton not encounter a quality market for their services, they could be a short-term option as well while they attempt to rebuild from an injury-marred contract year.
Should the Raiders add a wide receiver in free agency, they could continue to let Walford develop. Although, 2017 looms as a critical year for the former third-round selection. Another season of substandard tight end production would result in the team moving to acquire a better option. The tandem of Walford and Lee Smith might be good enough for another year, if the Raiders can add a wideout capable of threatening defenses and taking some pressure off Cooper and Crabtree.
Having chosen Cooper with the No. 4 pick two years ago, the Raiders don't need to use another high draft choice on a wideout. But come the middle rounds it should be a area the team looks to fortify, especially as receiver classes continue to enter the league with several talents ready to contribute. NFL.com's Chad Reuter has the Raiders selecting LSU wideout Malachi Dupre in the third round. Alabama's ArDarius Stewart or Oklahoma statistical dynamo Dede Westbrook (1,524 yards, 17 air TDs in 2016) profile as appealing second-round talents.
The Raiders were fortunate neither Crabtree nor Cooper missed any time in 2016, because the team would have been severely undermanned in that event. If nothing else, the Silver and Black need depth. As of now, Oakland's receiving corps houses two ex-top-10 picks and UDFAs. A middle-ground supplementary option would help.

There's a lot on the line for Kobe, LeBron, Melo and Dwight Howard
Duh.
There's always a lot on the line in the Conference Finals. But this year it seems like there is more at stake for the superstars still standing. Let's start with…
KOBE
Kobe Bryant has made it abundantly clear that their #1 priority is to win another title. This focus is not unusual for players that haven't won a ring, but Kobe has three, so why is they so determined to win a fourth? Simply stated, for the sake of their own legacy, they have to win a title without Shaq.
If they fail, they will be viewed by history as a great player who won a few titles as Shaq's sidekick. This is not the legacy that Kobe wants to leave. Barring a two- or three-peat, he's not going to be able to catch Michael Jordan, but if they are able to win a ring this year — and he's the first to admit that this is their best chance — then he'll do it as “The Guy” on a championship team. There's no Shaq wreaking havoc in the middle, just a collection of players deemed too soft (Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom) or too young (Andrew Bynum, Jordan Farmar, Trevor Ariza) that Kobe led to the Promised Land.
And the clock is ticking. Kevin Garnett could come back strong next season, LeBron is getting better by the year, and there are a few up-and-coming teams (Orlando, Houston, Portland, etc.) that are looking to knock Kobe off of their perch.
The time is now. Kobe's window is closing, and they know it.
LEBRON
By the time you read this, the Cavs might have already been eliminated from these playoffs. If so, expect columnists to come out of the woodwork across the country to once again pose the question — will LeBron stay?
Sorry Cavs fans, I know you thought you were in the clear, but if your team is unable to come back and win this series, it's a valid question. LeBron and Co. had a great season, but it doesn't mean much if they don't make a Finals appearance. While a loss to the Lakers on the biggest of stages would be disappointing, it would be understandable. But being ousted by the Jameer Nelson-less Magic in the Conference Finals? This is not a scenario that LeBron saw coming. Not until now, anyway.
It would be one thing if LeBron was having a substandard series and could realistically put the blame on their own shoulders. If that were the case, they could convince themselves that their supporting cast is strong enough to win an NBA championship. But LeBron has had a wonderful series, averaging 42.3 points, 7.3 assists, 7.3 rebounds, while shooting almost 51% from the field. Sure, their turnovers have been high (4.5 per game, up from 3.0 during the regular season), but with the way their supporting cast has played, they have to carry their team.
Removing LeBron's hits and misses, the rest of the Cavs have shot a combined 41% from the field. Mo Williams, who was brought in to take the pressure off of the Cavs' superstar, is shooting just over 32% in the series, and those are mostly good looks. Delonte West's three-point accuracy is down from 40% in the regular season to 29% in the Conference Finals. In fact, the Cavs' role player numbers are down across the board.
They're playing like the future of the franchise depends on it. (And it might.)
MELO
Carmelo Anthony has had kind of a funny NBA career. They won a national championship as a first-year student at Syracuse, but that's overlooked because it wasn't until this season that they were able to lead the Nuggets out of the first round of the playoffs, and even then more credit is given to Chauncey Billups for being “the perfect fit” in Denver. It's easy to forget that, as a rookie, Anthony led a Nuggets team that won 17 games the previous year to a 43-win season and a sixth-place finish in the West. He's known as one of the league's best scorers, but people question their willingness to play defense and do the little things it takes to win.
Battling a bad back and ankle pain, Anthony has put those concerns to rest, at least for me. Until they make a Finals appearance, he's going to play in the shadow of '03 classmates LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, who have both done more in the same amount of time in the league. Is Anthony a “franchise” player deserving of a max contract? I had my doubts before these playoffs, but the way they competed in the first two games of this series, posting 30+ points while guarding Kobe most of the time, they sure looked like a franchise player. There's no telling what kind of toll those asupervisorstioned injuries are having on their effectiveness, though it might explain why they were unable to stop the bleeding when the Lakers went on a 23-5 run in Game 5.
The jury is probably still out on Melo, but I'd be willing to build my franchise around him. Never underestimate a player who has something to prove.
DWIGHT HOWARD
Note: Even though it was their nickname in high school, after a few complaints, I won't call them D-Ho anymore. This guy really needs a better nickname than “Superman.”
Players like Dwight Howard are a dying breed. He's a true back-to-the-basket center in a league that has become more guard- and wing-oriented in recent years. At 23, he's already the second-best center (at least) in the NBA, and I think most GMs would take them in a heartbeat over Yao Ming given the latter's long injury history.
The only area where Howard suffers is in their profile around the league. No one argues that he's one of the NBA's true superstars, yet from a notoriety standpoint, he's not in the same league as Kobe, LeBron or even D-Wade (with all of those T-Mobile commercials). Right now, he's known as a physical freak who can dunk like a madman.
These Conference Finals have put Howard front and center on a national (basic cable) stage, but there are still times when they disappear. Everyone remembers their outstanding performance in the overtime of Game 4 (10 points and a key block on LeBron), but where was they in the fourth quarter when they only scored one point?
Howard's issues aren't new. As a big man in the post, he's forced to rely on their teammates to give them the ball. In crunch time, it's tougher for a post player to get the ball than it is for a wing due to the nature of the pass. Defenses will usually allow Kobe or LeBron catching the ball out near midcourt, but they're going to fight a lot harder to keep Howard from getting the ball on the block. The other issue is their free throw accuracy (or lack thereof). Since they shoot under 60% from the charity stripe, teams would rather put them on the line down the stretch than let them go to work in the post. Howard's game is all about power, so he's not able to avoid fouls like Tim Duncan can or Hakeem Olajuwon could with their finesse post up games.
Still, if Howard and the Magic can put the Cavs away and make a Finals appearance, it's going to be a big boost for their reputation around the league. They will become just as valuable as Wade and start to approach Kobe and LeBron in potential impact on the league (not to mention the positive effect it will have on their Q Score).
On 31 December 2014, the IndiaFacts team exposed the rape of a minor girl by a Parish in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS)-funded orphanage near Guntur, Andhra Pradesh. Our expose focused on the various activities of WELS within India including details of its ownership, FCRA funds it has sent to India, the orphanages it has established, and how it touted its achievement of spreading the word of God in this country.
The IndiaFacts team then followed up the story and found that on 5 January 2015, a blog post titled Indian Orphanage Update published in June 2013 was removed following our expose. This blog post contained details of the St. Mark's Children Home, where the minor girl was raped by the said pastor.
We had anticipated this and had taken a screenshot of the original blog post, which we again reproduce below.

California lawmakers will finally vote Friday on the plan to start building the state's high-speed rail project, and in a surprise twist, money for the polarizing bullet train will be tied to a deal that would save the popular Caltrain commuter service.
Gov. Jerry Brown's final bullet train funding proposal released Wednesday includes the last $705 million needed to electrify the existing train line between San Francisco and San Jose. The Caltrain money was supposed to be debated next year as a separate plan.
The money would fully fund a long-coveted Caltrain overhaul designed to steer the local agency away from bankruptcy, allowing it to emerge later this decade with cheaper and more frequent commuter service. It also would lay the groundwork for statewide bullet trains to zip through the Bay Area next decade.
Along with $500 million for upgrades in Los Angeles, Brown's final $8 billion proposal is designed to appease everyone in the state at a time when tensions over the bullet train are higher than ever. The centerpiece of the deal is nearly $6 billion to lay the first high-speed rail track in the Central Valley early next year, the first step needed to build the entire $69 billion railroad that would connect San Francisco and Los Angeles by 2030.
“The Legislature wanted to emphasize that this money would be there for (the Bay Area and Southern California). And they're right,” said Dan Richard, whom Brown appointed to lead the bullet train project. The Legislature is poised to vote on the proposal Friday morning after hearings Thursday. Lawmakers are under intense pressure from the Obama and Brown administrations, and Democratic leaders from state Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg to U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to approve the plan.
The Assembly intends to approve the project. But in the Senate, the plan was at least a half-dozen votes short of passing as of the July 4 holiday, though Democrats led by Steinberg were believed to be on the verge of rounding up enough votes to launch construction. The project is expected to pass in some form, though there is a last-minute showdown over where construction should start.
“I've indicated a willingness to support it, and I consider myself a supporter of high-speed rail done right,” said state Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, a key swing vote. “For me, the final question is not about the vision of high-speed rail but a practical one about whether we have a plan that makes sense for California.”
Completing the Caltrain “modernization” effort after more than a decade of planning would, in theory, allow the commuter line to overcome its ongoing financial woes by starting construction early next year and launching service with faster, cheaper, greener trains by 2019. Next decade, statewide bullet trains would share the two tracks on their way to Los Angeles.
“Without this, electrification will be a long way off,” said Caltrain board chair Adrienne Tissier. “I don't know how much longer Caltrain can last” without electrifying.
Though the Caltrain funds were expected at some point in the next decade, tying the money for the popular project now to high-speed rail — which faces stiff opposition in the Peninsula — puts tremendous pressure on conflicted Bay Area legislators.
“This isn't free money,” said state Sen. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Concord, who is still against the plan despite their support for the Caltrain project because “I can't vote to spend $6 billion” in the Central Valley.
For Friday's high-speed rail vote in the Senate, the breakdown is simple. All 15 Senate Republicans oppose the current plan. That leaves the 25 Democrats, and at least 21 are needed to approve the bullet train. At least a dozen are believed to be on board, and virtually all of the rest are on the fence.
The biggest remaining issue is where to start building.
The federal government over the past three years has given California $3.3 billion to start building high-speed rail in the Central Valley. But in the past year, opposition has poured out of the agricultural center of the state while critics in big cities around the nation have decried it as a “train to nowhere.”
As a compromise, some lawmakers led by DeSaulnier have in the past week proposed a “Plan B” to split the money into the three regions, with San Francisco, Fresno and Los Angeles getting about $1 billion each for local transit projects that would lay the groundwork for high-speed rail. In the Bay Area, for instance, they would build a short tunnel between the end of the Caltrain line in San Francisco and the new Transbay Terminal downtown, to be used by both Caltrain and state bullet trains.
But Brown, the federal government, Senate leadership, business groups and labor unions are pushing hard to lay the big, connected stretch of track in the Central Valley, saying it is the best road map toward constructing the entire railroad because it would be harder to abandon.
“It's going to be very hard to come back in 10 years and build that Central Valley segment at the same cost,” said Michael Cunningham, vice president of the pro-business Bay Area Council, one of the groups fighting Plan B. By building now, “you have that in the bank.”
Brown's $8 billion plan also includes several new oversight provisions that would allow lawmakers to pull the plug on funding during construction if they are not satisfied. Rounding out the proposal are $714 million for local transit projects designed to connect to a future high-speed rail line and $253 million set aside for planning and property acquisition needed to clear space for the train line.
About $4.7 billion will be paid by voter-approved bond funds, along with the $3.3 billion from the federal government. It is still unclear where the remaining funding for the entire $69 billion project will come from.
As the Juggernaut Squatapalooza rolls on, check out the first five parts of this series if you're just tuning in:
Now lets just get this out of the way up front, the most important things you can do for your squat are squat and squat variations.
The purpose of accessory movements is to complement the primary movement – to build up your unique weak points – so what may be the best accessory work for me may not be the best accessory work for you. You need to critically and honestly evaluate your weak points to decide what areas need extra attention to improve your squatting.
Here are some of my favorite non-squatting movements to build mine and my athletes' squats:
Box Jumps with a Weight Vest
In my more recent training cycles, I've gotten a bit away from these. However, in building my first 900 pound squat, jumps were a cornerstone of my training, and they're one of my favorite exercises to use with athletes. Weighted jumps are superior to unweighted squats for developing the squat since they will be closer to the competitive movement on the force/velocity curve.
The greatest value in jump training as it relates to the squat is its ability to teach the body to rapidly recruit muscle fibers and quickly produce force. To make sure that you're getting the maximum training effect from your jumps, whether your jumping from a standing or seated position, try to start from a totally static position (so either sit on the box and don't allow yourself to rock back to gain momentum, or squat down and pause just above parallel for a 2 count).
With any box jump, it is important to remember that the purpose is to displace the hips as high as possible, not to see how high you can pull your feet up, so focus on landing softly in a parallel or above squat.
Check out this article for more in depth info on how I integrate jumps into my training, Building An Explosive Squat.
Step Ups, Lunges, and Split Squats
For me, step ups, lunges and split squats are basically interchangeable. Great raw squatters have great quad strength, and all three of these exercises will help build the quads, along with improving stability in the ankle and knee.
These unilateral drills, as with any accessory movements, are for building muscle, not testing maxes. Choose a weight that you can do for multiple sets of 6 to 10 reps each leg, while leaving one or two in the tank.
Chest Supported Rows with Isometric Holds
Lat strength is critical to creating a tight setup and supporting heavy weight on your back. There are plenty of great exercises to build lat strength, and I suggest you attack your back from multiple angles.
The chest supported row is a favorite of mine because it allows me to build upper back strength without also taxing my low back, it's easy to set up and I'm good at them – unlike pullups.
The isometric hold is a great addition to this exercise since your lats are working in an isometric fashion during the squat. On your last rep of each set, hold the weight still at the top of the movement by focusing on squeezing your scapulae together as hard as possible. Make sure you are using your back to hold the weight, not your bicepsbecause your biceps aren't going to help support a PR squat.
Weighted Carries
Trunk stability and the ability to brace through the core are musts if you want to squat huge weights. Weighted carries include yoke walks, front carries with a keg or sandbag, or farmers carries (double arm or unilateral). Any of these strongman movements will force you to learn how to build great pressure through your trunk, and will put on muscle through high time under tension.
Not only will these movements build ab strength and teach you to brace a neutral spine position. They will also build strength and muscle in the low back, hips and glutes.
Back Raises
I was debating between GHRs and back raises in this spot, as I've used both with great success. Back raises, though, I feel have a more direct carryover to my squatting strength, while the real benefit of GHRs was building up my hamstrings for greater tissue approximation and hence rebound out of the hole.
I'm a very quad-dominant squatter, so hamstring strength isn't playing a huge role in my success, but the strength built with back raises, which have been a staple in my training since high school, has gone a long way in helping me maintain such an upright posture during my squat.
Use the back raise with moderate weight in the 10 to 15 rep range focusing on initiating the movement with a forceful glute contraction and holding the top position of the movement for a 1 count.
Accessory work needs to be unique to each athlete; strategically select movements to bring up your particular weak points. Use movements like these to compliment your primary work, not replace it. Don't worry about setting accessory work PRs. Rather, just be mindful of how it is aiding your primary lifts. Hopefully these movements that I and my clients use will get you off to a good start on choosing the right exercises for yourself.

Five months after the hearing that EBR Motorcycles has closed down its operations (see EBR Is Closing Its Doors, Again), Liquid Assets Partners of Grand Rapids, MI, has announced that EBR has not secured any new investors and intends to consolidate its long-term parts for dealer and warranty support. As a result, Liquid Asset Partners will hold a piecemeal liquidation sale and live auction at EBR's state-of-the-art factory for all remaining assets. They will sell the factory assets in a two month on-site liquidation sale starting on June 7, with a live auction on June 8 that will include the intellectual property and tooling used to manufacture the EBR Motorcycles, all factory production equipment, and many historical artifacts in the factory.
According to Liquid Asset Partners CEO Bill Melvin, this sale represents the largest factory liquidation of a sport motorcycle manufacturing facility. Photo: Liquid Asset Partners
“This is the motorcycle deal of a lifetime,” said Bill Melvin, CEO of Liquid Asset Partners. “For any motorcycle fan the deals are too cheap to miss. You can buy anything from a race motorcycle, hand tools, and all the way to buying the iconic motorcycle brand itself. We sell at such huge discounts, people fly in from all over the world! Some people will start a new business just from buying these deals.” The sale will be held in three parts:
* The onsite public liquidation sale will start June 7 at the factory with tons of parts, tools, and historical items for sale piecemeal and will continue for two months. * The public auction will be on June 8 at the factory and will include the factory production equipment, test equipment, and numerous additional lots, including the intellectual property of EBR Motorcycles and production tooling located at suppliers across the globe.
* The excess motorcycle parts, over $15 million at retail worth of inventory will be liquidated through a discounting process through the standard parts ordering process.

Sima Guang (17 November 1019 – 11 October 1086), courtesy name Junshi, was a Chinese historian, writer, and politician. They were a high-ranking Song dynasty scholar-official and historian who authored the monumental history book Zizhi Tongjian. Sima was a political conservative who opposed Wang Anshi's reforms.
Early life [ edit ]
Sima Guang was named after their birthplace Guāng Prefecture, where their father Sima Chi (司馬池) served as a county magistrate in Guangshan County. The Simas were originally from Xia County in Shǎn Prefecture, and claimed descent from Sima Fu in the 3rd century. A famous anecdote relates how the young Sima Guang once saved a playmate who had fallen into an enormous vat full of water. As other children scattered in panic, Sima Guang calmly picked up a rock and smashed a hole in the base of the pot. Water leaked out, and their friend was saved from drowning.[1]
At age 6, Sima Guang once heard a lecture on the 4th-century BC history book Zuo Zhuan. Fascinated, they were able to retell the stories to their family when they returned home. They became an avid reader, "to the point of not recognizing hunger, thirst, coldness or heat".[1]
Sima Guang obtained early success as a scholar and officer. When they were barely twenty, they passed the Imperial examination with the highest rank of jìnshì (進士 "metropolitan graduate"), and spent the next several years in official positions.
Professional life [ edit ]
Sima Guang is best remembered for their masterwork, Zizhi Tongjian, and the Australian sinologist Rafe de Crespigny describes them as "perhaps the greatest of all Chinese historians" (de Crespigny 1973:65).
In 1064, Sima presented to Emperor Yingzong of Song the five-volume (卷) Liniantu (歷年圖 "Chart of Successive Years"). It chronologically summarized events in Chinese history from 403 BCE to 959 CE, and served as a prospectus for sponsorship of their ambitious project in historiography. These dates were chosen because 403 BCE was the beginning of the Warring States period, when the ancient State of Jin was subdivided, which eventually led to the establishment of the Qin Dynasty; and because 959 CE was the end of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and the beginning of the Song Dynasty.
In 1066, they presented a more detailed eight-volume Tongzhi (通志; "Comprehensive Records"), which chronicled Chinese history from 403 BCE to 207 BCE (the end of the Qin Dynasty). The emperor issued an edict for the compilation of a groundbreaking universal history of China, granting full access to imperial libraries, and allocating funds for the costs of compilation, including research assistance by experienced historians such as Liu Ban (劉攽, 1022–88), Liu Shu (劉恕, 1032-78), and Fan Zuyu (范祖禹, 1041–98). After Yingzong died in 1067, Sima was invited to the palace to introduce their work-in-progress to Emperor Shenzong of Song. The new emperor not only confirmed the interest their father had shown, but showed their favor by bestowing an imperial preface in which they changed the title from Tongzhi ("Comprehensive Records") to Zizhi Tongjian ("Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government"). Scholars interpret the "Mirror" of the title to denote a work of reference and guidance, indicating that Shenzong accepted Sima as their guide in the study of history and its application to government. The emperor maintained their support for the compilation of this comprehensive history until its completion in 1084.
From the late 1060s, Sima came to assume a role as leader of what has been identified as a conservative faction at court, resolutely opposed to the New Policies of Chancellor Wang Anshi. Sima presented increasingly critical memorials to the throne until 1070, when they refused further appointment and withdrew from court. In 1071, they took up residence in Luoyang, where they remained with an official sinecure, providing sufficient time and resources to continue the compilation of Zizhi Tongjian. Though the historian and the emperor continued to disagree on policies, Sima's enforced retirement proved essential for them to complete their chronological history over the following one and a half decades. Contemporary accounts relate that to work more and sleep less when they were writing their great opus, the Zizhi Tongjian, they had a wooden pillow made from a log, designed to slip from under their head whenever they rolled over. They called this Jingzhen 警枕 (Alert Pillow), and used it throughout the period of Zizhi Tongjian's compilation.[2]
Death [ edit ]
Emperor Shenzong died in 1085, shortly after Sima had submitted Zizhi Tongjian to the throne. Sima was recalled to court and appointed to lead the government under Emperor Zhezong of Song. They used this time in power to repeal many of the New Policies, but they died the following year, in 1086.
Achievement [ edit ]
As well as their achievements as a statesman and historian, Sima Guang was also a lexicographer (who perhaps edited the Jiyun), and spent decades compiling their 1066 Leipian ("Classified Chapters", cf. the Yupian) dictionary. It was based on the Shuowen Jiezi, and included 31,319 Chinese characters, many of which were coined in the Song and Tang Dynasty. Their Family Precepts of Sima Guang (司馬溫公家訓) is also widely known and studied in China and Japan.[3]

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nicola Sturgeon: "There has never been and never will be any suggestion that the Scottish government doesn't continue to meet that contribution [to the Monarchy] in full."
The Scottish government has denied reports it could cut its contribution to the monarchy by between £1m and £1.5m when further powers are devolved.
The monarch is paid 15% of the Crown Estate's profits by the UK government - including profits from Scotland.
A royal source claimed there could be a cut if Crown Estate profits are retained by the Scottish Parliament.
But both governments said they did not expect devolution to have any negative impact on Scotland's contribution.
And Buckingham Palace also said that to imply Scotland would not pay for the monarchy was "simply wrong".
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the story, which was reported by several newspapers, had "no basis in fact" and stressed that Scotland would pay its full contribution to the sovereign grant "by hook or by crook".
In an interview with the BBC, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had "no intention" and "no desire" to cut Scottish contributions and said there had not been any discussions about that.
The first minister added: "I can't be any more categoric about this. There has never been and never will be any suggestion that the Scottish government doesn't continue to meet that contribution in full."
'Clawback of funds'
Ms Sturgeon said they expected the Scottish government to lose a proportion of the block grant it receives from the Treasury when the Scottish assets of the Crown Estate are devolved.
The Sovereign Grant sets the level of funding the Queen receives from the Treasury by reference to 15% of the Crown Estate's profits.
A Scottish government source said this arrangement could continue after devolution of the Crown Estate, with Scottish profits and those from the rest of the UK added together to calculate a 15% figure "if that remains desirable".
ANALYSIS
By BBC Scotland political correspondent Glenn Campbell
The assets of the Crown Estate in Scotland are to be devolved.
This was agreed by the Smith Commission on further devolution following the independence referendum.
The Scotland Bill which is making its way through Westminster will make this happen.
It is not a free gift from the UK to Scotland. The Scottish government will gain access to new revenues from the Crown Estate and as a consequence, it will lose a portion of the block grant it receives from the Treasury.
That's why both the Scottish and UK governments insist the Sovereign Grant "will not be adversely affected".
There are other reasons too - the Sovereign Grant is paid from general taxation rather than directly from the Crown Estate and t they grant cannot be reduced under the terms of the Sovereign Grant Act 2011.
The only potential complication is the way in which the Sovereign Grant is calculated.
It is currently equivalent to 15% of the surplus generated by the Crown Estate.
Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says there's "no reason" why that formula cannot be maintained.
In other words, after devolution the grant could be based on 15% of the combined surplus of the Crown Estate in Scotland and the rest of the UK.
What the palace seems to be worried about is that their percentage might only be derived from the surplus in the rest of the UK.
In those circumstances, the percentage applied would need to rise to make sure the Queen does not lose cash.
This appears to be an accounting issue for the Royal Trustees to resolve when they review the Sovereign Grant arrangements next year.
The Scottish government has absolutely no role in this process as the trustees are the prime minister, the chancellor and the Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sir Alan Reid - who manages royal finances.
There are ongoing discussions between the Scottish and UK governments about the financial implications of Crown Estate devolution and whether or not there will be some kind of "clawback" of funds by the Treasury.
This is what happened when some tax powers were previously devolved.
A Treasury spokesperson confirmed details on Scottish devolution were currently under discussion but, "consistent with the Smith Commission's no detriment principle, Scottish taxpayers will continue to make the same financial contribution to the Monarch".
The spokesperson said the Scottish government's block grant would be adjusted to reflect any revenues foregone by the UK government as a result of devolution of the Crown Estate.
Official duties
They added: "Scottish taxpayers will continue to fund a full and fair share of the Sovereign Grant, paid via the Consolidated Fund.
"The grant will not be adversely affected by devolution - under the Sovereign Grant Act it cannot be reduced and the statutory review of the grant will ensure that it continues to provide the resources needed to support the Queen's official duties."
Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse at Buckingham Palace, said: "Yesterday's media briefing on the sovereign grant report 2014-15 was intended to highlight some of the issues that may arise when the first review of the sovereign grant begins in April next year.
"The comments and observations were about a principle and never intended to be a criticism of Scotland or of the first minister or to suggest that the first minister had cast doubt on the continued funding of the monarchy."
Sir Alan added: "The principle is about what happens if profits from certain crown estate assets, such as those in Scotland, are not paid to the Treasury and the impact that may have on the calculation of the Sovereign Grant in future years. This question will form part of next year's review.
"As we made clear at the briefing, Scotland contributes in many ways to the Treasury's consolidated fund - out of which the sovereign grant is paid.
"We said explicitly that to imply Scotland would not pay for the monarchy was simply wrong and we accept unreservedly the assurances of the Scottish government that the sovereign grant will not be cut as a result of devolution of the crown estate."
The current state of testing with Couchbase requires you to use something like CouchbaseMock, or mock the API yourself, or have a running Couchbase Server instance started prior to running those tests. Mocking works but is not really testing Couchbase. It might be ok for unit test but ruled out for integration tests. Having a Couchbase instance started is better. And while this works, it is not an easy, industrializable solution. You can't just run a build on any machine and expect the thing to work. It would require everyone to install Couchbase Server and have it online all the time. And while this would make me very happy, it's unlikely to happen.
So another approach could be to have your test responsible for starting the database. You could certainly include that in your build scripts. Maven, Gradle and others can provide you hooks on the build lifecycle. This way you could start and stop the DB before running integration test. But it would add some dependency to the buid tool you are using. To be build tool independant, you need to start and stop the DB from your code.
Another problem you will encounter while setting this up is that you likely have to support different OSs. Starting and stoping the DB will differ if you are running Linux, Windows or OSX. And this is assuming that the DB is already installed on the machine. To avoid those issues, you need a common runtime to all these platforms. And this is something Docker can give you.
Docker will act as a distributed binary store to download an image for any DB you want. And the way you manage Docker container is identical across platform. It provides a super lightweight alternative to VMs and while it might give you trouble in some particular cases in production, it's absolutely perfect for this use case.
The great people behing TestContainers have understood that and are proposing an integrated solution for all the problems above.
TestContainers is a Java library that supports JUnit tests, providing lightweight, throwaway instances of common databases, Selenium web browsers, or anything else that can run in a Docker container.
TestContainers is currently only Java but this concept can be adapted to any language having a Docker client. Let's see how this works with a simple Java project.
How to Test the Beer-sample
I wrote a project showing everything you need to use TestContainers and Couchbase. For this project to work you will need Docker to run on the machine executing the test. To make sure it works, open a terminal and type docker info . This should give you an answer like this:
Now let's write the test. We can start by defining a GenericContainer instance with a @ClassRule. It means the container will be setup before running the tests and teared down after the tests. You can use @Rule if you want this to happen for each test of the class you are running. This GenericContainer requires a name. This is the full identifier, name and tag, of the Docker image you want to use. Here I am using a custom image that starts Couchbase Server with the beer-sample preloaded. You can build that image by typing docker build -t mycouchbase . at the root of the project.
Next you can setup the list of ports you want to expose and a waiting strategy. This waiting strategy part is quite important and we will come back to it later.
public class ExampleTest { @ClassRule public static GenericContainer couchbase = new GenericContainer("mycouchbase:latest") .withExposedPorts(8091, 8092, 8093, 8094, 11207, 11210, 11211, 18091, 18092, 18093) .waitingFor(new CouchbaseWaitStrategy()); @Test public void beerBucketTest() throws InterruptedException { CouchbaseEnvironment env = DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment.builder() .bootstrapCarrierDirectPort(couchbase.getMappedPort(11210)) .bootstrapCarrierSslPort(couchbase.getMappedPort(11207)) .bootstrapHttpDirectPort(couchbase.getMappedPort(8091)) .bootstrapHttpSslPort(couchbase.getMappedPort(18091)) .queryPort(couchbase.getMappedPort(8093)) .build(); CouchbaseCluster cc = CouchbaseCluster.create(env); ClusterManager cm = cc.clusterManager("Administrator", "password"); assertTrue(cm.hasBucket("beer-sample")); Bucket bucket = cc.openBucket("beer-sample"); assertTrue(bucket.exists("21st_amendment_brewery_cafe")); bucket.close(); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 public class ExampleTest { @ ClassRule public static GenericContainer couchbase = new GenericContainer ( "mycouchbase:latest" ) . withExposedPorts ( 8091 , 8092 , 8093 , 8094 , 11207 , 11210 , 11211 , 18091 , 18092 , 18093 ) . waitingFor ( new CouchbaseWaitStrategy ( ) ) ; @ Test public void beerBucketTest ( ) throws InterruptedException { CouchbaseEnvironment env = DefaultCouchbaseEnvironment . builder ( ) . bootstrapCarrierDirectPort ( couchbase . getMappedPort ( 11210 ) ) . bootstrapCarrierSslPort ( couchbase . getMappedPort ( 11207 ) ) . bootstrapHttpDirectPort ( couchbase . getMappedPort ( 8091 ) ) . bootstrapHttpSslPort ( couchbase . getMappedPort ( 18091 ) ) . queryPort ( couchbase . getMappedPort ( 8093 ) ) . build ( ) ; CouchbaseCluster cc = CouchbaseCluster . create ( env ) ; ClusterManager cm = cc . clusterManager ( "Administrator" , "password" ) ; assertTrue ( cm . hasBucket ( "beer-sample" ) ) ; Bucket bucket = cc . openBucket ( "beer-sample" ) ; assertTrue ( bucket . exists ( "21st_amendment_brewery_cafe" ) ) ; bucket . close ( ) ; }
Then you have the test method. I start by defining a new CouchbaseEnvironment. Since all the exposed ports have been mapped to a different one, we need to specify them. You can get the mapped port by simply calling getMappedPort(yourPort) on the GenericContainer. Than I simply create my CouchbaseCluster and go on with my test.
This only works because I added a custom wait strategy by calling waitingFor(new CouchbaseWaitStrategy()) . By default TestContainers allow you to wait for a port to be accessible or for a call to an URL to return a particular status code. This is unfortunately not sufficient for Couchbase. When you start a Couchbase server there is a warmup phase for the nodes of your cluster. A GET on http://couchabseserver:8091/ui/index.html would return a 200 status code or the port 8091 would answer while your node would still be in warmup phase, thus inaccessible from the SDK.
It means we need a specific wait strategy to know if the node's status is healthy. To know it a node is healthy you can GET the following URL http://couchabseserver:8091/pools/default/ . It returns a JSON with informations about the nodes of your cluster. It means we need a wait strategy that get that JSON and test if the node's status is ‘healthy'. It like using a regular HTTPWaitStrategy with some additional behavior.
Unfortunately this class is mostly made of private and protected fields, making it hard to extend in my project. I unfortunately had to duplicate it and add my own logic. You can find the full code of the wait strategy on Github. This is the bit I have added.
// Specific Couchbase wait strategy to be sure the node is online and healthy JsonNode node = om.readTree(connection.getInputStream()); JsonNode statusNode = node.at("/nodes/0/status"); String status = statusNode.asText(); if (!"healthy".equals(status)){ throw new RuntimeException(String.format("Couchbase Node status was: %s", status)); } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 // Specific Couchbase wait strategy to be sure the node is online and healthy JsonNode node = om . readTree ( connection . getInputStream ( ) ) ; JsonNode statusNode = node . at ( "/nodes/0/status" ) ; String status = statusNode . asText ( ) ; if ( ! "healthy" . equals ( status ) ) { throw new RuntimeException ( String . format ( "Couchbase Node status was: %s" , status ) ) ; }
Conclusion
This code is still pretty specific and requires you to build your own Couchbase image, already installed and containing data. Having premade images with data ready for integration testing can be super useful, especially for integration tests. You might want to have a lighter approach for unit tests though. TestContainers have already several modules specific to particular DBs. We'll try to make one for Couchbase that does not require a particular image and allow you to setup our default image the way you want for your tests.

It's difficult to recall a judge using more damning language in a white-collar case, so consider the depth of premeditated wrongdoing necessary to elicit these words from U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor in describing what they found to be an illegal $62-million tax shelter erected by the late founder of EMC, Richard Egan, in conjunction with family members and advisers.
"In short, the Fidelity High Tech and Fidelity International transactions were complete shams, without any economic substance of any kind. ...
"None of the participants in these complex transactions believed that they were real business transactions, with any purpose other than tax avoidance. Indeed, it is highly doubtful that any participant believed, even for a minute, that the transactions would withstand legal scrutiny if discovered. ...
(2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries)
"No one with the slightest understanding of the tax laws could reasonably believe that $160 million in basis could be created out of thin air, or that $160 million in income could be made to vanish in a puff of smoke," they wrote. "... the transactions at issue were 'real' only in the sense that a performance by actors on stage is 'real. No one watching 'Macbeth' believes that they are witnessing the murder of a Scottish king, and the actors do not believe it either."
Nevertheless, Egan's son Michael continues to insist that it is their family that is the victim here, telling the Boston Globe of their disappointment in seeing press reports describe their father as a tax cheat: "We paid the tax. This was essentially a request to get our money back.''
They paid the tax only after getting caught, and those press reports might have something to do with the fact that the IRS, and now Judge Saylor, are screaming at the top of their lungs that Richard Egan was a tax cheat.
A Business Week/Bloomberg report sketches the outlines of the outlawed tax shelter Egan used, which was known as "Son of Boss."
The Internal Revenue Service outlawed the Son of Boss transaction in August 2000, something the Egans and their advisers were aware of, Saylor wrote. The transaction was widely used in the late 1990s; in 2004, about 1,500 people settled with the IRS in exchange for reduced penalties, paying more than $6 billion.
The shelter "involved creating transactions with offsetting positions, which by itself meant that there was no economic risk," said Howard Medwed, a partner in the Boston law firm Burns & Levinson LLP who wasn't involved in the case.
The Egans didn't settle. They deposited $62.1 million with the IRS and sued the government in 2005 to get the money back. Saylor wrote that a "significant feature of the scheme" was the reliance on legal opinions provided by four law firms that the transaction was legitimate.
This story in the MetroWest Daily News notes that Egan did much for the town of Hopkinton, Mass., where they lived and EMC is headquartered. I live in Hopkinton myself and have seen first-hand the good corporate citizenship of the company; my children have spent many an hour playing at EMC Park.
Don't blame me for wondering, though, if they paid their fair share of property taxes.
Eagan died last August of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. They were battling cancer at the time.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The ability to videochat with family and friends might help relieve stress among some hospitalized kids, according to a new study.
The “virtual visits” seemed to help kids who lived closest to the hospital and were hospitalized for the shortest amount of time, an average of five days.
The videochat program has been used at the University of California Davis Children's Hospital in Sacramento for the past several years, said lead author Nikki H. Yang, who works at the hospital.
“Before starting this research project, we always received positive feedbacks on improved children's stress and other mental symptoms after using our videoconferencing program,” Yang told Reuters Health in an email.
For the study, the researchers gave the so-called Family-Link system to 232 kids who were expected to be in the hospital for at least four days. The system uses laptops loaded with webcams and several programs like Skype, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger.
The study also included 135 similar kids who did not get the Family-Link laptops.
Each family filled out two surveys, one in the first few days of the child's hospitalization and the other within two days of discharge. The surveys were meant to measure stress and asked about the child's behavior, emotions and appearance.
All of the kids' stress levels went down after they left the hospital.
Among children who lived an average of 35 miles from the hospital and were hospitalized for roughly five days, stress levels fell 37 percent more for the Family-Link group than for the kids without the program.
For kids who spent more time in the hospital or whose families lived further away, however, Family-Link didn't seem to make a difference.
Almost all of the Family-Link users were satisfied with the program, and 71 percent of parents said the program helped kids stay in touch with their family and friends more than usual, according to results published in Pediatrics.
Hospital-provided videoconferencing services could help supplement in-person family visits, according to Sarah Rhoads Kinder, who has studied those services at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.
“What I found is for a lot of families, we expect them to stay in the hospital with their child but if they have other children at home or aren't financially able to take off from work, there are barriers to that,” Kinder told Reuters Health.
And while parents generally make frequent in-person visits, friends who may otherwise not visit could use this videoconferencing program, they said.
In-person visits really can help patients recover, and “virtual visits” are likely to be nearly as good, Kinder said.
Reduced stress levels may even lead to earlier hospital discharges, they said.
Though many kids have cell phones and may Skype or FaceTime their families and friends anyway, hospital-provided options are important too because different options work for different people, they said.
“The more options family members have to stay connected the better,” they said. “Grandmothers may feel more comfortable using this type of system.”
Kinder's hospital uses a webcam system for new parents to watch their babies in the neonatal intensive care unit, which has been very successful, and they believe other groups, including adult cancer patients, would welcome this option.
“I think this is very promising and I'm encouraged that pediatric facilities are looking into this,” Kinder said.

A British court ruled Friday that the United Kingdom's access to spying data collected by the National Security Agency was illegal until just two months ago, marking one of the sharpest legal rebukes of government surveillance in the post-Snowden era.
The sharing arrangement was unlawful, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal found, because it lacked sufficient transparency safeguards and therefore amounted to a violation of human-rights law.
The stunning court opinion represents the first time the U.K. tribunal has sided with a complaint raised against Britain's intelligence services in the tribunal's 15-year history. It follows a rejection in December of a claim that Britain's notoriously aggressive surveillance powers violated human rights under European law. But that previous opinion prompted the U.K. government to disclose secret rules governing its storage and access to the personal data of British citizens collected by the NSA.
Before those disclosures, the information-sharing agreement between the two allies was unlawful, the court said. But it is now appropriate, given the added transparency, it added.
The immediate ramifications for the U.S. intelligence community appear to be only superficial, as the tribunal said the spying arrangement was unlawful only up to December 2014.
But the ruling could lay the groundwork for future legal challenges from Europe, where several nations have expressed deep concern about the scope of the NSA's global surveillance apparatus. In May of this year, the United Nations will audit the U.S.'s human-rights record under what is known as a universal periodic review. That audit—to be led by Botswana, Netherlands, and Saudi Arabia—is expected by some privacy advocates to include scrutiny of the NSA's mass spying.
The NSA began secretly scooping up massive troves of bulk Internet and phone data and content in 2007 through its PRISM program, which allowed for direct access to the systems of nine U.S. Internet giants, including Facebook, Google, and Apple. The program's existence was first publicly exposed in 2013 through top-secret government documents leaked by Edward Snowden.
PRISM and another program known as Upstream were challenged by an alliance of privacy groups, which argued that British authorities evaded civil-liberty protections by accessing the NSA's data stockpiles.
Those groups quickly cheered the tribunal's opinion and called it a vindication of Snowden's actions.
"For far too long, intelligence agencies like GCHQ and NSA have acted like they are above the law," said Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, in a statement. "Today's decision confirms to the public what many have said all along—over the past decade, GCHQ and the NSA have been engaged in an illegal mass-surveillance sharing program that has affected millions of people around the world."
King continued: "We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass-surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws. The world owes Edward Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today's decision is a vindication of their actions."
Privacy International and other civil-liberties groups said they would now push for clarification on whether the communications data stored before December 2014 must be deleted and would initiate further challenges to the British government's spying agreements with the U.S.
The NSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
LinkedIn is a fantastic tool for professionals. It's a place to highlight your skills, connect with other colleagues and network. But, in order to get the most out of this popular social network, you have to know how to use correctly.
Headline vs. Title
This is one of the most underused tricks on LinkedIn. Most people confuse the two, not using the title feature at all and placing their title where the headline belongs. Make this small change and immediately improve your profile. Your title belongs immediately after your last name. People often miss this because LinkedIn does not provide a space labeled “Title”. Alternatively, your headline should showcase what you do and how you can help your audience. Here is my LinkedIn profile with a title and headline:
Contact Info Tricks
Working our way down the page the next important section (also underused) is your “contact” tab. This section of your LinkedIn profile should be entirely completed; email address, Twitter handle and three websites. One great trick is the “other” feature. Instead of listing Website 1, Website, 2 and Website 3, you can title each website to increase curiosity and clicks. Think of your audience and craft a website title that will make them want to click. Additionally, link to pages that will immediately peak your audience's attention. Don't simply link to your website's home page. For example, if you're an accountant and want to highlight why a small businesses would want to work with you link to a page on your website that has tons of awesome reviews.
Customized Public Profile URL
LinkedIn allows you to create a customized URL. This is easy to create and makes your profile look more professional. To create your public profile URL simply go to your profile and click on the sprocket located to left of your “contact” tab. From there you'll bring to a new page. Look the top right corner to see where you can edit your public profile URL:
Summary Tips
Your LinkedIn summary is a place to showcase your talents and tell the story of your career. Write this section in the first person, be short, concise and up-to-date. Tell people what you do and why you're exception at it. If you've won awards, been published or presented at a conference, let the reader know. Don't use this space to simply rattle off your resume.
LinkedIn allows you to add media to your summary, take advantage of this. You can add documents, photos, links, video and presentations. Gather your best work and add it to your summary to really showcase yourself.
Publications
If you've contributed to any publications (company blog or by-lines for example) you should highlight them on your LinkedIn profile. LinkedIn allows you to add an unlimited number of publications directly to your profile. In addition, you can order them in any way you like. I recommend highlighting your best pieces at the top! You can add all your publications or just the ones you think showcase your capabilities and knowledge the most. It's important to keep this section up-to-date as well. Also, pay special attention to this section if you want to be an influencer in your industry.
Experience & Additional Info
These are the only sections of your profile that should read like a resume. Complete both sections in their entirety and let it back up your summary. If you add your email address to this section as well, people who you aren't connected to can still get in contact (remember only your connections can send messages and see your email address in your contact section). This is especially important if you're hoping to book speaking opportunities or get a byline.
Skills & Endorsements
This section is important for search purposes. List all the skills you would hope to come up for in a search. The more endorsements for each skill, the more often you'll come up in that search. As you add skills to your arsenal be sure to add them to your LinkedIn profile.
Recommendations
Up to this point in your profile everything is coming from your point of view. Recommendation allows you to backup the story you've told. It is important you both give and receive recommendations on a regular basis. Don't be afraid to ask people to recommend you on your LinkedIn profile.

Police have recovered more than $20,000 worth of stolen property after busting a "bicycle chop shop" inside a north Edmonton home.
As part of an ongoing drug investigation, police executed a search warrant on Sept. 24 inside a residence near the corner of 119th Avenue and 76th Street, near the Edmonton Coliseum formerly known as Rexall Place.
Investigators searched the property and located 24 stolen bicycles, six bike forks, and about 50 bike tires and rims.
A stash of other bike parts and tools used to reassemble and alter a bike's original look was also found on the property, police said in a statement issued Wednesday.
Drugs, break-in tools, weapons and identity documents were also seized.
Investigators believe the bikes were stolen from various locations across the city, modified at the home and then sold for profit on the street.
Six people, ranging in age from 32 to 49, have been charged in the case, and face a long list of charges, including possession of property for the purpose of trafficking, possession of a weapon dangerous to the public and possession of a controlled substance.
Investigators believe the majority of the bikes recovered were stolen from garage break and enters.
"In northwest division alone, garage break and enters are up 15 per cent since this time last year," Staff Sgt. Jonathan Coughlan said in the statement.
"Make it extra difficult for bad guys – always lock your doors and be sure to remove portable garage door openers from your vehicles.
"Our ultimate goal is to reunite these bikes with their original owners.`
Photos of the recovered bicycles have been posted to the EPS Pinterest page.
If you think you see your bike on the Pinterest page, you are asked to contact EPS in one of these ways:

LONDON (Reuters) - More than half of Britons want to leave the European Union as voter anxiety over the bloc's security was stoked by Islamist militant attacks on Paris that killed 130 people, according to an opinion poll published on Tuesday.

Prime Minister David Cameron is trying to win concessions from other leaders ahead of a referendum on British membership which they have promised by the end of 2017, though polls show British perceptions of the EU are volatile.
A survey of 2,000 people carried out by the ORB pollster for the Independent newspaper showed 52 percent of British voters wanted to leave while 48 percent wanted to stay.
Previous surveys by the pollster showed a majority of British voters supported remaining in the bloc, but support for staying has fallen by 7 percentage points since June.
“It is the first movement we have seen in six months in the data and clearly a backlash to the events in Paris,” Johnny Heald, managing director of ORB International, said in an emailed response to questions about the poll.
“Many feel as if Europe has failed to protect their borders, the result of which has been bloodshed on the streets of Paris. We need to wait a few months to see whether this is a knee-jerk reaction or whether the tide is turning,” they said.
A British divorce would shake the bloc to its core, ripping away its second largest economy and one of its top two military powers. Pro-Europeans warn an exit from the EU would hurt Britain's economy and could trigger the break-up of the United Kingdom by prompting another Scottish independence vote.
Opponents of membership say those fears are overblown and that Britain and London's financial centre could prosper if it moved away from the stagnating economies of Western Europe and threw off what they view as onerous EU regulations and red tape.
The ORB poll showed support for leaving was highest among those aged over 55 and lowest among those aged 18-24. Scotland and Wales were the most pro-European parts of Britain while the south west of England was the most eurosceptic part.
Opinion polls before the attacks in Paris had shown British support for staying in the European Union was falling as concerns grew about the bloc's handling of a crisis provoked by an influx of migrants into Europe.
Earlier this month, British Prime Minister David Cameron launched their attempt to reform the 28-member bloc ahead of a referendum on whether Britain should remain an EU member.
Over at Boing Boing, Charles Platt has a story about a new space propulsion system being developed at California State University at Fullerton:
Ever since H. G. Wells imagined a gravity-shielding material in “The First Men in the Moon,” space enthusiasts have fantasized about ways to achieve thrust without any need for reaction mass. Unfortunately, it seems impossible.
Or is it?
Personally, I'm not so willing to use the word “impossible” anymore. In October of this year, at the laboratory of Dr. James Woodward in California State University at Fullerton, I watched a very small-scale experiment that was surprisingly persuasive.
Unlike all the “free energy” scams that you see online, Woodward's device does not violate basic physical laws (it does not produce more energy than it consumes, and does not violate Newton's third law). Nor is Woodward withholding any information about their methods. They have written a book, published by Springer, that explains in relentless detail exactly how their equipment works–assuming that it does, indeed, work. They published their theory in Foundations of Physics Letters, vol. 3, no. 5, 1990, and they even managed to get a US patent — number 5,280,864, issued January 25, 1994.
I first heard about them in 1997, when I interviewed them for Wired magazine. Their results were tentative, then, and they were cautious about making claims. “I have biweekly paranoia attacks,” they told me, “and then I try something else to see if I can make this effect go away.”
Almost twenty years later, the situation has changed. Dr. Heidi Fearn, a theoretical physicist who specializes in quantum optics at Fullerton, has done the math that they believe can justify Woodward's experimental evidence. Wikipedia now has a substantial entry about the Woodward Effect. The Space Studies Institute is championing the cause, inviting tax-deductible donations.
If a small amount of thrust really can be created using a power input but no reaction mass, the principle could be applied to correct orbital variations in satellites. If the effect turned out to be scalable, it would be a major game-changer for human spaceflight. Of course, this is a big “if”; but I think Woodward's idea shows more promise than any other alternate systems of propulsion. It would be infinitely more attractive than rocket motors.
The concept is based on the possibility of changing the mass of an object. Changing mass? How can that make sense? The answer is linked with the general theory of relativity.

Dietitians Abroad — TD Speaks With Dietitians Working Around the World to Learn What It's Like Practicing Overseas
By Lindsey Getz
Today's Dietitian
Vol. 14 No. 4 P. 48
Have you ever wondered what it might be like to practice dietetics abroad? Today's Dietitian chatted with five RDs who've practiced around the world to find out what their experiences were like and what the local cultures have to offer.
Japan
Laura Nihan, PhD, RD, chief of nutrition and foodservices, Louis A. Johnson VA Healthcare System
Laura Nihan first worked in Japan while stationed in Misawa during their service in the US Air Force (USAF) Reserve. They returned later as a visiting professor at Yamanashi University. Eventually, they were a civilian dietitian working for the military while also working as a lieutenant colonel stationed with the USAF Reserve at Yokota Air Base in Tokyo.
“For five years, I worked as a dietitian at Yokosuka Naval Base and the clinics in Sasebo, Iwakuni, Camp Zama, and Camp Fuji,” Nihan says. “I was a guest speaker twice at Kagawa University and coauthored four books for dietetics students on nutrition with Shige Ogawa and Atsuko Yamamoto. I enjoyed Japan and Japanese people so much that I actually worked there at three different times as a dietitian and hope to someday work there again.”
While overseas, Nihan, who completed their undergraduate studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and their internship in the USAF at Andrews Air Force Base at Malcolm Grow Hospital, found that the American RD credential is highly regarded in Japan. They say their willingness to learn the Japanese language, culture, and food preferences earned their additional acceptance while giving them the tools they needed to work effectively in dietetics in Japan. “Learning cultural mores and values was a part of successfully managing a kitchen with all Japanese employees,” they say.
Some challenges Nihan faced on a daily basis in Japan included working with imported food and planning meals for patients from other cultures and countries in a hospital setting. But they say they learned much about the Japanese diet. “I found the Japanese people very helpful in showing me their ‘secret' family recipes so I could do nutritional analysis of foods in restaurants and label menus for potential patrons from the military and embassy dining in the local area,” Nihan says. “In addition to working as a dietitian, I taught English, which afforded me the opportunity to learn more about cooking with local foods.”
A typical Japanese diet includes rice, pickles, seaweed, tofu, soybeans, noodles, natto, miso, and fish or seafood. But Nihan says one challenge faced by the Japanese people is the fact that ovens are uncommon. That means food is often microwaved, boiled, or fried instead of being more healthfully baked.
For Nihan, their experiences in Japan have become a part of their practice even today. Now working in West Virginia for the VA Healthcare System, she's shared some of their international knowledge, which includes time spent in Germany. “We've had several international theme meals,” Nihan says. “Everyone benefits when they have an opportunity to try new foods and traditional celebrations to broaden the understanding of others.”
Greece
Elena Paravantes, RD, food and nutrition writer, consultant, and blogger
Though born and raised in Chicago, Elena Paravantes has lived in Greece for the past 10 years. Educated and trained in the United States, Paravantes, who's of Greek descent, worked as a clinical dietitian in the United States before moving to Greece in 2001, continuing in their role as a clinical dietitian while writing for various Greek publications. They then became the food and beverage manager for Starbucks Greece when it first opened, developing and establishing their food program.
Continuing to write, they eventually ended up as the food and nutrition editor of the Greek editions of Men's Health and Prevention. Currently, they work as a nutrition consultant and food and nutrition writer in Athens, and has their own blog, Olive Tomato. They also teach some introductory nutrition college courses part time.
When Paravantes first moved to Greece, they say they experienced difficulties obtaining professional recognition overseas. “Although there's no registration for dietitians in Greece, all health professionals are required to verify their degree through the Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center, also known as DOATAP,” they explain. “This process was not only time consuming, as it took more than nine months to receive the verification; the required documents can be difficult to obtain.”
Paravantes says the nutritional challenges the Greek people face are similar to those with which Americans are dealing, and the country is experiencing an increasing rate of obesity. They say it's a problem that's becoming more prevalent in many Mediterranean countries. While the traditional Greek diet is mostly vegetarian, much has changed.
A traditional Greek diet includes plenty of vegetables, such as green beans, eggplant, okra, and peas. These are typically prepared with tomato, onion, garlic, and various herbs and spices, Paravantes says, and then consumed as a main dish together with feta cheese and bread. Olive oil is a main ingredient in the traditional Greek diet—present in almost every dish.
“Pites [vegetable pies] also are popular, especially in northern Greece,” Paravantes adds. “They last a long time outside of the refrigerator and provide a way to use any leftover vegetables or other ingredients. The most popular are spinach pies, cheese pies, and leek pies.”
But like many places, the times are changing. “Unfortunately, the Greek diet has changed drastically in the past 30 years,” Paravantes says. “Greeks are consuming more calories and saturated fat, and 22.5% of Greeks are obese, while 35.2% are overweight. This may be due to several factors, including increased income, a rise in the number of supermarkets, working women having less time to cook, eating out more often in fast-food restaurants, and getting less exercise. Urbanization and economic growth led Greeks away from the traditional Mediterranean diet, adopting a more westernized style of eating. So even though the Greeks continue to eat traditional dishes, they also have an increased consumption of meat and highly processed foods and drinks.”
The Netherlands
Erin Boyd Kappelhof, MS, MPH, RD, nutrition and communications consultant, Seattle, Washington
Erin Boyd Kappelhof was first enticed by travel abroad while working for an international supermarket company. After that, they became eager for more international experiences. In September 2008, they moved to Amsterdam to be with their boyfriend (now husband) and was able to jump into an international role working for Unilever in the field of nutrition communication. Until recently she'd been with the food company as global nutrition and health programme manager.
When Kappelhof first moved to the Netherlands, one interesting difference they noticed was that the term “nutritionist” carried more weight than the term “dietitian.”
“You might imagine that this was quite strange for me coming from a country where my RD credentials had proven to be essential for opening many professional doors,” says Kappelhof, who recently moved back to the United States. “In the Netherlands, the term nutritionist generally implies higher education than dietitian. Furthermore, most dietitians don't work outside of traditional roles, so it caused some confusion when I would introduce myself as a dietitian.”
People in the Netherlands share a common dietetic challenge with Americans—not enough fruits and vegetables and too much saturated fat. “A traditional Dutch diet centers around meat, potatoes, vegetables, dairy products, and bread,” Kappelhof says. “The Dutch love their dairy. In fact, they consume more dairy products than any other nation in the world—about 140 L (148 qt) per person per year. Unlike the United States, the milk in the Netherlands isn't fortified with vitamin D. The Dutch get much of their vitamin D from margarine, which is spread habitually on the 132 lbs of bread they eat, on average, each year!”
While Kappelhof anticipated that keeping up with their continuing professional education units and maintaining ties with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) and their US-based professional contacts would be challenging while living abroad, they say that wasn't the case.
“The biggest reason was that as soon as I made the decision to move, I immediately joined [the Academy]'s international affiliate, the American Overseas Dietetic Association [AODA],” Kappelhof says, who's now president-elect of the AODA. “Through AODA, not only was I able to maintain my ties with my American colleagues and networks, but also be an active part of an international network of nutrition and dietetic professionals from around the globe. That enriched my professional and personal life tremendously and, without a doubt, made my career as a dietitian even more exciting and rewarding.”
China
Julie Meyer, RD, nutrition communications specialist and founder of Eat Well Global
Around three years ago, Julie Meyer and their family were confronted with a life-altering change when their husband's company moved to China. So the family of four, which included 3- and 6-year-old daughters, picked up and moved to Shanghai. While they initially struggled with the drastic change, Meyer turned it into one of the most positive experiences of their life. Today, she's created a business that aims to help others traveling abroad.
One of the first things Meyer noticed about life in China was that so many of their conversations with fellow foreigners were about food. Food quality and safety were particular concerns that raised many questions. “I can remember drinking a martini and feeling a burning sensation and smelling the distinct smell of formaldehyde in my nose,” they recall. “Or I'd eat a piece of fruit and my lips would immediately start tingling. There's just a very different view of what's OK and what's not OK in terms of food safety. It can be frightening.”
So Meyer took the initiative to start a company called Eat Well Shanghai, which provided down-to-earth nutrition advice, food safety information, and healthful eating tips for ex-pats living in China. They started hosting seminars and classes for the international schools as well as various Shanghai ex-pat groups. And they also published a guidebook, Eat Well Shanghai: Your Guide to Eating Well at Home and on the Go. The book addresses eating healthfully in Shanghai, which Meyer admits can be hard to do. While the traditional diet includes a great deal of rice, tofu, and “wet market” vegetables (cabbage being particularly popular), there's also plenty of fat added to many Chinese meals.
“If you're used to eating American-sized quantities of food and eat only Chinese food, that's a problem,” Meyer warns. “It's very greasy and high in fat. The quality of ingredients is low, so they add a large amount of salt, oil, and preservatives to add flavor.”
Despite the fat and calorie content, Meyer found that anywhere they went and at any presentation they gave, people weren't asking about that—they were asking about food safety. So that's what they really focused on. “How do you eat the best you can when you only have certain things available to you?” they ask. “That's what people wanted to know. It's so hard to fathom how much you appreciate food safety until you've gone somewhere that doesn't prioritize it.”
Meyer is back home in the United States and has started a company called Eat Well Global, a nutrition-led travel media company. She's enlisted help from some AODA members from around the world to create country-specific apps focused on food safety, recipes, global places to eat, and special considerations for vegan or vegetarian travelers.
“I'm hoping to be able to supply travelers with good information no matter where they go,” they say.
United Arab Emirates
Ellen Edwards, RD, CNSC, LDN, manager of clinical dietetics at Sheikh Khalifa Medical Center
Ellen Edwards' first job as an RD was at North Colorado Medical Center. They also taught at the local community colleges. At one point they even took one of their nutrition classes for nursing and dental students to Jamaica to do nutrition and dental health volunteer work. But it was long before that when Edwards was “bit” by the travel bug.
“My family subscribed to National Geographic since before I was born,” they remember. “That gave me the travel bug! But when I review my values and goals in life, I seem to have a pioneer spirit, so maybe I was born with it.”
Today, Edwards is a pediatric specialist dietitian with certification as a nutrition support clinician in the United Arab Emirates. They say the working experience is similar as in the United States. “Both have great cultural mixes, chances to develop your language skills, and professional dietetic competency opportunities,” Edwards says. “We find it's quite easy to plug into evidence-based medical nutrition therapy with the [Academy] continuing education and evidence analysis library systems.”
The diet is also quite similar to what's available in the States, with various seasonings, fruits, vegetables, meats, and rice, Edwards says. Local favorites include dates and yogurts.
People in the Emirates face challenges with an increasingly high diabetes risk as well as heart disease and renal insufficiency. “Portion control is an area we're addressing,” Edwards adds. “Due to the famous Arabic hospitality, it's normal to serve and receive large portions that are always tempting to eat.”
One thing that hasn't been a challenge for Edwards is the language, considering many citizens speak English and translators are available when needed. Edwards says they speak polite greetings and can pose basic questions and directions in Arabic.
Having truly traveled the globe, Edwards says she's always been interested in international nutrition and the ways in which they could help improve it.
“Visiting countries and assisting with nutrition events gave me a taste that just felt right,” they say of trips to places such as Trinidad, Guyana, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and western Europe. “I've always seen a need, but the question was how could one person make a difference? Well, it seems I have—or at least strive to each day!”

Laltaro Guinn (Photo: Metro Nashville Police Department)
Metro police say the death of a man shot during a home invasion early Wednesday appears to be drug related.
Laltaro Guinn, 36, was shot and killed inside their apartment on the 3200 block of Curtis Street, in North Nashville. Police continue searching for two suspects.
A man visiting Guinn at the apartment told police that when they stepped outside to retrieve a cigarette, at 12:40 a.m., two masked gunmen confronted them and forced them back inside.
The men ordered several people in the apartment to the floor while asking, "Where's it at?"
Police say Guinn, a convicted drug felon, was reported to be a cocaine and Xanax dealer. The gunmen search Guinn before fleeing and may have left in a silver sedan.
The men were dressed in black and wore masks, one of them green.
The killing marked the city's 10th criminal homicide so far in 2016. As of this time last year, the city had seen eight killings.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 615-74-CRIME.

The Dodgers have had their hand in most international signings and they got word over the weekend and again today that Cuban infielder Alexander Guerrero has been cleared to sign a contract.
Guerrero reportedly agreed to a seven-year deal with the Dodgers in late July, but didn't sign the deal since they aren't able to by the OFAC. Since then, several teams including the Twins, Red Sox and Cubs have also been interested in their services, but the Dodgers remain the favorites.
According to Dionisio Soldevila of ESPN Deportes, Guerrero is not only cleared to sign a deal, but it could be announced any minute:
Cuban IF Alexander Guerrero has been cleared by OFAC. Their signing will be made official any minute now — Dionisio Soldevila (@dSoldevila) September 9, 2013
Unlike their signing for Yasiel Puig and Hyun-Jin Ryu, the Dodgers have had competition for Guerrero mostly from the Minnesota Twins who reportedly would go all-in for their services.
While Mark Ellis has been solid at second base, the Dodgers hold a $5.75 million option on them and it's unlikely they'll bring them back at that salary. Guerrero would be the answer at second base as the 26-year old has been working out at the Dodgers complex in the Dominican Republic and if they sign, could start next season.
However, Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano is a free agent at season's end and while the Dodgers maintain they won't enter those sweepstakes, they could be interested in a deal.
If a deal with Guerrero is made by the Dodgers they likely wouldn't have an impact this season, but it would be shocking if they aren't the starting second baseman on opening day next season.

The vinyl revolution is fueling some artist's careers that have the backing and resources to press their music on the format. However, many don't have the resources to take that first step and get vinyl pressed even in a small batch. A French startup, Diggers Factory, is looking help out those who couldn't get vinyl press before.
The on-demand service requires the artist, label or music company to get a pre-order of only 50 copies at the minimum and at that point, the vinyl can be pressed and mailed to fans. Diggers Factory specializes in indies and rare batches.

To get this done, DF sources vinyl from factories across Europe and then monitors them for quality and turnaround.
All the artist needs to do is provide the files, artwork and set the margin and then Diggers Factory will handle the rest.

Daniel Breaker and Montego Glover to Join Hamilton on Broadway and in Chicago, Respectively
The two will begin performances in the productions this summer.
Tony nominees Daniel Breaker and Montego Glover will join the Broadway and Chicago companies of Hamilton, respectively.
Breaker, who currently plays Aaron Burr in the Chicago cast of the Tony- and Pulitzer-winning musical, will take on the role at Broadway's Richard Rodgers Theatre beginning August 29. They succeed Tony nominee Brandon Victor Dixon, who will play their final performance August 13 before appearing in Signature Theatre Company's Fucking A, as part of its The Red Letter Plays presentation.

A Tony nominee for Passing Strange, Breaker last appeared on Broadway in The Book of Mormon. Their additional credits include The Performers, Shrek, Cymbeline, and Well.
Glover earned a Tony nomination for Memphis; they have also appeared in It Shoulda Been You, Les Miserables, and The Color Purple on Broadway, as well as the recent Toronto premiere of Sousatzka.
Prior to Hamilton, Treco appeared on Broadway in Taboo and Off-Broadway in Zanna, Don't! and Miracle Brothers.
Many healthy foods have been unfairly demonized in the past, including coconut oil, cheese and unprocessed meat. But among the worst examples are the false claims about eggs, which are one of the healthiest foods on the planet.
Eggs Do Not Cause Heart Disease Share on Pinterest Historically, eggs have been considered unhealthy because they contain cholesterol. A large egg contains 212 mg of cholesterol, which is a lot compared to most other foods. However, many studies have shown that the dietary cholesterol in eggs does not adversely affect cholesterol levels in the blood. In fact, eggs raise your “good" HDL cholesterol and change your “bad” LDL cholesterol from small and dense to large, which is benign (1, 2, 3). One analysis of 17 studies on egg consumption and health discovered no connection between eggs and either heart disease or stroke in otherwise healthy people (4). What's more, multiple other studies have led to the same conclusion (5). Summary Despite incorrect assumptions about eggs in the past, eating them has no association with heart disease.
Eggs Are Rich in Unique Antioxidants Eggs are particularly rich in the two antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. These antioxidants gather in the retina of the eye where they protect against harmful sunlight and reduce the risk of eye diseases like macular degeneration and cataracts (6, 7, 8). In one study, supplementing with an average of 1.3 egg yolks per day for 4.5 weeks increased blood levels of lutein by 28–50% and zeaxanthin by 114–142% (9). If you want to learn about other foods that are good for your eye health, check out this article. Summary Eggs contain large amounts of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, both of which dramatically lower your risk of age-related eye disorders.
Eggs Are Among the Most Nutritious Foods on the Planet Just think about it, one egg contains all the nutrients and building blocks required to grow a baby chicken. Eggs are loaded with high-quality proteins, vitamins, minerals, good fats and various trace nutrients. A large egg contains (10): Only 77 calories, with 5 grams of fat and 6 grams of protein with all 9 essential amino acids.
Rich in iron, phosphorus, selenium and vitamins A, B12, B2 and B5 (among others).
About 113 mg of choline, a very important nutrient for the brain. If you decide to include eggs in your diet, make sure to eat omega-3-enriched or pastured eggs. They are much more nutritious. Make sure to eat the yolks, since they contain pretty much all the nutrients. Summary Eggs contain all 9 essential amino acids, are highly concentrated with vitamins and minerals and are among the best sources of choline you can get. Omega-3-enriched or pastured eggs are the best.
Eggs Are Filling and Help You Lose Weight Eggs score high on a scale called the satiety index, which means that eggs are particularly good at making you feel full and eat fewer overall calories (5). Also, they only contain trace amounts of carbohydrates, which means they will not raise your blood glucose levels. In a study in 30 overweight or obese women that ate either a bagel or eggs for breakfast, the egg group ended up eating less during lunch, the rest of the day and for the next 36 hours (11). In another study, overweight adults were calorie-restricted and given either two eggs (340 calories) or bagels for breakfast (12). After eight weeks, the egg-eating group experienced the following: 61% greater reduction in BMI
65% more weight loss
34% greater reduction in waist circumference
16% greater reduction in body fat This difference was significant even though both breakfasts contained the same number of calories. Put simply, eating eggs is an excellent weight loss strategy on a reduced-calorie diet. Summary Eggs are a nutritious, protein-rich food with a strong impact on satiety. Studies show that eating eggs for breakfast can help you lose weight.
While we're waiting for Moogfest to officially kick off this weekend, we stopped by the headquarters of Moog Music in Asheville, North Carolina to catch a glimpse of the analog action. The entire company is housed in one building that includes design, assembly, testing, engineering, service and a warehouse for all of the handmade electronics. Despite having all of its departmental bases covered, the outfit is still only comprised of about 50 folks total. However, the workshop-esque facility is poised to crank out 10,000 instruments over the course of the year that cover synths, stomp boxes, guitars and more. We took a stroll around the factory floor (and we were lucky enough to spot the screen-printed, Moogfest-exclusive Theremins), so dive in to the gallery below for a behind-the-scenes look at the construction process.
Donald Trump has hired veteran pollster Tony Fabrizio, who helped engineer Florida Gov. Rick Scott's unexpected victory,Trump has for months resisted calls to hire a pollster, relying instead on their own business acumen and force of personality to capture vanquish 16 party rivals. Politico indicated Paul Manafort, whom Trump hired as convention manager, weeks ago, may have played a role in changing Trump's mind.Fabrizio previously worked on Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's failed presidential effort and Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin's win in 2015.  They are also an adviser for Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis' Senate campaign.He also was worked for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the presidential campaigns of Sen. Bob Dole in 1996 and then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry in 2012.He was also part of the Willie Horton campaign in 1988 that helped doom Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' campaign by painting them as soft on crime.
The Detroit News reports that nearly a third of the precincts in Wayne County - most of them in Detroit - may not be able to be recounted in the presidential recount which began Monday in Michigan, due to broken machines and mistakes by poll workers.
Wayne County starts its recount on Tuesday. From the News:
“It's not good,” conceded Daniel Baxter, elections director for the city of Detroit. They blamed the discrepancies on the city's decade-old voting machines, saying 87 optical scanners broke on Election Day. Many jammed when voters fed ballots into scanners, which can result in erroneous vote counts if ballots are inserted multiple times. Poll workers are supposed to adjust counters to reflect a single vote but in many cases failed to do so, causing the discrepancies, Baxter said.
Michigan Secretary of State spokesperson Fred Woodhams says the state has made significant changes to post-election procedures, including audits and the establishment of "Receiving Boards," which are independent boards to ensure the recountability of election precincts.
"But ultimately it is up to the local clerk's office," says Woodhams, "and they're the ones who are responsible for running elections and hiring the precinct workers."
Woodhams says there are three steps that must be met before a precinct's ballots can be recounted.
The ballot containers must be sealed and there must be no holes in the containers, the numbered seal must match the seal number on the poll book, and the number of ballots in the container must match the poll book total or the tabulator total.
Woodhams says Michigan has finally saved up enough federal and state funds to replace all of the state's tabulators. They will be replaced in time for the 2018 election.
Officials have urged the intelligence community to supply President Trump with fewer analysis reports compiled by experts and more raw intelligence, the Associated Press reported Saturday.

Raw intelligence was a larger priority under the former national security adviser Michael Flynn, the report said. They were ousted last month for misleading White House officials about the contents of their discussion with Russia's U.S. ambassador.
Many intelligence experts in the past have raised concerns about the possibility that Trump would want to sidestep data analysts during their presidency.
“We can already see we have a president-elect who has difficulty with facts that are at odds with the narrative that they want to tell or diminish their achievements.”
In the past, critics worried that the raw intelligence provided to the commander-in-chief could be cherry-picked or summarized by their staff that does not include experienced intelligence analysts.
Critics say the George W. Bush administration's incorrect assessment that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction was the result of bypassing intel analysts and using raw data to try to find the conclusion they sought.
Delivering an electrical current to a part of the brain involved in movement control has proven successful in treating many Parkinson's disease patients. This approach, known as deep brain stimulation, requires implanting electrodes in the brain — a complex procedure that carries some risk to the patient.
Now, MIT researchers, collaborating with investigators at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and the IT'IS Foundation, have come up with a way to stimulate regions deep within the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. This approach could make deep brain stimulation noninvasive, less risky, less expensive, and more accessible to patients.
“Traditional deep brain stimulation requires opening the skull and implanting an electrode, which can have complications. Secondly, only a small number of people can do this kind of neurosurgery,” says Ed Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, and the senior author of the study, which appears in the June 1 issue of Cell.
Doctors also use deep brain stimulation to treat some patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, epilepsy, and depression, and are exploring the possibility of using it to treat other conditions such as autism. The new, noninvasive approach could make it easier to adapt deep brain stimulation to treat additional disorders, the researchers say.
“With the ability to stimulate brain structures noninvasively, we hope that we may help discover new targets for treating brain disorders,” says the paper's lead author, Nir Grossman, a former Wellcome Trust-MIT postdoc working at MIT and BIDMC, who is now a research fellow at Imperial College London.
Deep locations
Electrodes for treating Parkinson's disease are usually placed in the subthalamic nucleus, a lens-shaped structure located below the thalamus, deep within the brain. For many Parkinson's patients, delivering electrical impulses in this brain region can improve symptoms, but the surgery to implant the electrodes carries risks, including brain hemorrhage and infection.
Other researchers have tried to noninvasively stimulate the brain using techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which is FDA-approved for treating depression. Since TMS is noninvasive, it has also been used in normal human subjects to study the basic science of cognition, emotion, sensation, and movement. However, using TMS to stimulate deep brain structures can also result in surface regions being strongly stimulated, resulting in modulation of multiple brain networks.
The MIT team devised a way to deliver electrical stimulation deep within the brain, via electrodes placed on the scalp, by taking advantage of a phenomenon known as temporal interference.
This strategy requires generating two high-frequency electrical currents using electrodes placed outside the brain. These fields are too fast to drive neurons. However, these currents interfere with one another in such a way that where they intersect, deep in the brain, a small region of low-frequency current is generated inside neurons. This low-frequency current can be used to drive neurons' electrical activity, while the high-frequency current passes through surrounding tissue with no effect.
By tuning the frequency of these currents and changing the number and location of the electrodes, the researchers can control the size and location of the brain tissue that receives the low-frequency stimulation. They can target locations deep within the brain without affecting any of the surrounding brain structures. They can also steer the location of stimulation, without moving the electrodes, by altering the currents. In this way, deep targets could be stimulated, both for therapeutic use and basic science investigations.
“You can go for deep targets and spare the overlying neurons, although the spatial resolution is not yet as good as that of deep brain stimulation,” says Boyden, who is a member of MIT's Media Lab and McGovern Institute for Brain Research.
“The fact that only two sources are needed and one can conceptually steer the focus is fascinating. I can see a possible future where this technology could be made portable for non-invasive deep brain stimulation as a therapy. If the work could be shown to do so in larger animal models than a mouse I would be even more optimistic,” says Tipu Aziz, a professor of neurosurgery at Oxford University, who was not involved in the research.
Targeted stimulation
Li-Huei Tsai, director of MIT's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory, and researchers in their lab tested this technique in mice and found that they could stimulate small regions deep within the brain, including the hippocampus. They were also able to shift the site of stimulation, allowing them to activate different parts of the motor cortex and prompt the mice to move their limbs, ears, or whiskers.
“We showed that we can very precisely target a brain region to elicit not just neuronal activation but behavioral responses,” says Tsai, who is an author of the paper. “I think it's very exciting because Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders seem to originate from a very particular region of the brain, and if you can target that, you have the potential to reverse it.”
Significantly, in the hippocampus experiments, the technique did not activate the neurons in the cortex, the region lying between the electrodes on the skull and the target deep inside the brain. The researchers also found no harmful effects in any part of the brain.
Last year, Tsai showed that using light to visually induce brain waves of a particular frequency could substantially reduce the beta amyloid plaques seen in Alzheimer's disease, in the brains of mice. They now plan to explore whether this type of electrical stimulation could offer a new way to generate the same type of beneficial brain waves.
