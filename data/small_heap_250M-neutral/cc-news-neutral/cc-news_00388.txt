Children Of Immigrants Are Top U.S. High School Science Performers (Forbes)
An impressive 83 percent (33 of 40) of the finalists of the 2016 Intel Science Talent Search, the leading science competition for U.S. high school students, were the children of immigrants, according to a new study by the National Foundation for American Policy.

What would we lose if immigrants could no longer come to America? Surprisingly, one of the most important things America would lose is the contributions made by their children.
A new study from the National Foundation for American Policy found a remarkable 83% (33 of 40) of the finalists of the 2016 Intel Science Talent Search were the children of immigrants. The competition organized each year by the Society for Science & the Public is the leading science competition for U.S. high school students. In 2017, the talent search competition was renamed the Regeneron Science Talent Search, after its new sponsor Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,and a new group of 40 finalists – America's next generation of scientists, engineers and mathematicians – are competing in Washington, D.C., from March 9 to 15, 2017.
Both family-based and employment-based immigrants were parents of finalists in 2016. In fact, 75% – 30 out of 40 – of the finalists had parents who worked in America on H-1B visas and later became green card holders and U.S. citizens. That compares to seven children who had both parents born in the United States.
To put that in perspective, even though former H-1B visa holders represent less than 1% of the U.S. population, they were four times more likely to have a child as a finalist in the 2016 Intel Science Talent Search than were parents who were both born in the United States.
Parents who were international students were more likely to have a child as a finalist than native-born parents. A total of 27 of the 40 children – 68% – had a parent who came to America as an international student. That means if international students cannot remain in America after graduation (through Optional Practical Training and improved visa policies) it will also deprive America of the potentially substantial contributions of their children.

Every NHL award season, people talk more about the players who didn't get nominated than those who were. This year, there should be a lot of talk about one Calder Trophy snub, the Winnipeg Jets' Kyle Connor.
Let's start by saying that Mathew Barzal, Clayton Keller, and Brock Boeser had incredible seasons with their respective teams. It's also a near-guarantee that Barzal will be winning, regardless of who the finalists are.
However, the fact that Connor was not named a finalist for the Calder is strange, considering how incredible their first official season was.
A Spectacular Rookie Season
While you can argue about who should or shouldn't be finalists, you cannot argue that Connor had anything but a spectacular season.
Connor was given their first chance with the Jets during the 2016-17 season. It didn't go well for him. They bounced around the lineup, potting five points in 20 games before being sent back down to the Manitoba Moose, the Jets' AHL affiliate.
The Jets' first-round pick in 2015 started their rookie season in the minors but earned a quick call-up after Mathieu Perreault went down with an injury.
Thirty-one goals later, Connor finished the season on the Jets' top line and helped lead their team to a franchise-best record and now a first-round win over the Minnesota Wild.
Those 31 goals rank first in the NHL for rookies, while their 57 points put them fourth, ahead of Calder finalist Boeser.
A Serious Case
Only one rookie this year really pushed their name right to the top, while rookies not named Barzal fought for the right to be nominated.
And while the others certainly deserve the nomination, it's unfortunate that Connor didn't get any love, now or throughout the season.
Barzal, Keller, and Boeser all played on the first or second line throughout their year, but all three of those teams missed the playoffs. Connor played on the top line on an elite team that not only made the postseason but finished second in the league.
Connor rose above other excellent players such as Patrik Laine, Nikolaj Ehlers, Bryan Little, and Mathieu Perreault to cement themselves into the line with Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler. They thrived there, putting up 22 points in their final 25 games.

Generated 4/23/2018. Provided by Hockey-Reference.com Generated 4/23/2018. Connor's signature during the 2017-18 season was their ability to come through in the clutch. Their seven game-winning goals led all rookies and leave them tied for 11th in the league with names like Evgeni Malkin, Connor McDavid, and Alex Ovechkin. And in those final 25 games, he's tied for first with five.
Connor's clutch play helped the Jets finish 19-5-1 and head into the postseason on a nine-game home winning streak (which they have since extended to 12 games).
Unlike a number of top scorers, Connor did a lot of their best work at even strength, scoring 24 of their 31 without any advantage. That ties them with fellow Jet Laine, who scored 44 goals in total.
Where is the Love for Connor?
Sadly, Connor plays in Winnipeg, where national media attention is rarely received. He's also been overshadowed by big names like Wheeler and Laine, and big humans like Dustin Byfuglien. Along with a record-setting year for goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, the rookie didn't have much of a chance.
And that might be OK. Jared Clinton of The Hockey News reminded Jets fans that “there are bigger fish to fry with the way the Jets are playing as they head towards the post-season.”
Still, being the 12th rookie since the 2005-06 season to score 30 goals should have given them a significant amount of attention. Instead, Connor will focus on the very thing that they already have been all season: a Stanley Cup victory.
The three rookies nominated for the Calder Trophy had great rookie seasons, but the NHL overlooked the incredible season that Connor had. They can make it up, though, by helping their team to a Stanley Cup.
In 2013: 1507 vote win; 46.6 per cent-39.8 per cent. Held by three-time incumbent Marc Dalton, a Social Conservative who was flirting with jumping to federal politics but decided not to. Always a close race, but they increased their vote total by 1,500 from 2009, which may suggest changing demographics in that riding that favor the BC Liberals.
The NDP vote declined by almost 100, the Greens went up by a little more than 400 and the Conservatives took almost 1,200.
In 2009: BC Liberal Marc Dalton defeated NDP candidate Mike Bocking by 64 votes, the second closest margin in the province.
History & Geography: A riding with rural and urban characteristics, Maple Ridge-Mission spans from the eastern half of Maple Ridge at 224th Avenue to the western edge of Mission at Cedar Street. The riding has gone to the Liberals in all three elections since it was created, but other ridings north of the Fraser have elected NDP MLAs in the past. The urban centres of Mission lean towards the NDP, while the rural area inbetween the two municipalities has heavily supported the Liberals in past elections.
Candidates
BC Liberals' Marc Dalton is a former Maple Ridge school teacher. Dalton was elected in 2009 and is the Secretary for Independent Schools.  They are Aboriginal, speaks French and has led student exchanges to Quebec.
NDP's Bob D'Eith is a Maple Ridge entertainment lawyer. They won the nomination by acclamation.
Greens's Peter Tam is a data systems analyst.

Jodhpur/New Delhi: Security was stepped up in Jodhpur on Tuesday where prohibitory orders have already been clamped ahead of Wednesday's trial court verdict in the alleged rape of a teenager by self-styled godman Asaram who faces a minimum term of 10 years if convicted. Apprehending a threat to law and order, the Centre asked Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana governments to tighten security and deploy additional forces as the three states have a large number of followers of the 77-year-old Asaram.
The Delhi Police also is on high alert ahead of the trial court's verdict. A senior police official said the department is keeping a close watch on Delhi's boundaries and inside the city areas, where Asaram's supporters might gather after the judgement.
"We are in touch with police forces from neighbouring states to avert any untoward incident. Senior officers from districts and SHOs of police stations concerned have been directed to keep a watch in their respective areas," they added.
In a communication, the Union Home Ministry told the three states to beef up security and ensure that no violence takes place after the judgment on Wednesday. The three states were also told to deploy additional forces in sensitive places, a Home Ministry official said. As per the directions of the Rajasthan High Court, the trial court will deliver its verdict in the Jodhpur Central Jail premises where Asaram has been lodged for the past over four years.
"We have made all arrangements for the judgment day," DIG Jail Vikram Singh said. "The magistrate along with court staff, Asaram and the co-accused along with the defence and prosecution counsels will remain present in the courtroom in the jail premises," they said.
Asaram is accused of raping a teenage girl from Shahajahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who was studying at the godman's ashram at Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh. Asaram has denied the rape charges. The victim had alleged that Asaram called them to their ashram in Manai area near Jodhpur and raped them on the night of August 15, 2013.
"I have full faith in the judiciary and am confident that Asaram will be given the severest form of punishment," said the victim's father. Security was also stepped up around the victim's house in Shahajahanpur.
"The security for the victim's family is continuously being monitored... Two more constables will stand guard outside their house in addition to the five police officers already deployed there, and a strict vigil is being maintained on all the visitors using CCTV cameras," Superintendent of Police K B Singh told PTI.
A vigil was also being kept outside Asaram's ashram at Rudrapur, they said. The Union Home Ministry's advisory was sent in view of the fact that large-scale violence was witnessed in Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh after a special court in Mohali convicted Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim last year.
Final arguments in the Asaram case had been completed by the special court for SC/ST cases on April 7 and the court had kept the order reserved for 25 April. Asaram was arrested in Indore and brought to Jodhpur on 1 September, 2013. They have been under judicial custody since 2 September, 2013.
The chargesheet against Asaram and four other co-accused Shiva, Shilpi, Sharad and Prakash was filed by the police on November 6, 2013 under various sections of the POSCO Act, Juvenile Justice Act and IPC. If convicted, Asaram could be jailed for a minimum of 10 years or awarded a maximum life term, according to prosecution lawyers.
Asaram is also facing a rape case in Surat in Gujarat in which the Supreme Court earlier this month gave five weeks time to the prosecution to complete the trial. "We have imposed section 144 of CrPC in the city from April 21 and it would remain effective till April 30. Besides this, we have been keeping a sharp eye on Asaram's ashrams and checking all hotels and guest houses as well as the bus and railway stations,” DCP (East) Aman Deep Singh said in Jodhpur.
"We will also seal the jail on the day of judgment and would not allow anyone to get close to the jail premises," they said. Asaram unsuccessfully moved 12 bail applications, of which six were rejected by the trial court, three by the Rajasthan high court and three by the Supreme Court.
ISLAMABAD, Oct 6 (APP): Minister for Interior Ahsan Iqbal Friday said Directorate General of Immigration and Passport should review its current laws to further facilitate citizens and meet new challenges.
“We are living in the 21th century but relevant laws of
the department are too old,” they said during a briefing given
by the Director General Immigration and Passport Usman Akhtar Bajwa here.
The minister asked the Director General to take all the
stakeholders on board and update relevant laws which were too old and make them simple and effective.
“Agent Mafia and delay in the issuance of passport to
the public should be abandoned now and there should be no
compromise on black sheep in the department,” they said.
Usman Akhtar Bajwa briefed that the Immigration and
Passport Office had issued 4.3 million passports in a year
and generated revenue of over Rs 20 billion.
They said the department had issued 91 citizenship
certificates and dealt with 3,717 renunciation cases in
2016-17 besides only two cases of naturalization of
Somali citizens in 2014-15.
The Director General said that there were seven zones
of the department in which three were in Punjab and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Regarding the achievements of Passport Office from the
period 2013 to 2017, they said that number of passports had
increased by 30 percent as compared to previous 5 years and increase in the revenue was 35 percent.
In all, 84 Regional Passport Offices (RPOs) out of 164
and 74 Foreign Missions out of 91 were established during the tenure of the present government, they added.
To reduce queues, they said that all the branches of
National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) in 15 major cities were
collecting passport fee and payment of passport fee could
also be made through NBP Mobile/branchless banking
service.
Usman Akhtar said the other initiative was to eliminate
queues with the provision of facilities of Executive Passport
Offices, RPOs at district level, online passport renewal outside Pakistan, home delivery service in the country and home delivery service for online applicants abroad.
To improve the customers awareness, they said there were
several steps that had been taken including the launch of
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) in six languages which
received 300 calls per day.
They said the Passport and Immigration had also started
SMS Rabta Service for proactively seeking feedback from every applicant and over 250,000 SMSes were sent per month. The feedback system received 18000 to 25000 replies per month.
Usman Akhtar said that administrative action has been taken
on consistent complaints and over 65 officials including incharges at Regional Passport Offices were replaced.
Regarding the upgradation of Machine Readable Passport to
E-Passport, the Director General said that Prime Minister had
approved launch of the E-Passport project.
They said under the project, initially the validity of the
official and diplomatic E-Passports will be for 10 years.
The minister assured full support to the Directorate General
of Immigration and Passport to resolve the administrative and financial issues on priority basis.
It's being called the toughest budget any Saint John Common Council has ever had to consider. The grim economic realities the city faces have generated a budget that calls for massive cuts to police, fire and many other services.
The $152-million plan brings with it a stable tax rate, something strongly supported by the mayor as the city looks to get its fiscal house in order.
“This is a budget that puts the citizens and taxpayers first and that's the way it must be,” said Mayor Don Darling.
Councillor Gerry Lowe voted against, citing cuts to protective services and also the need for tax reform involving heavy industry.
READ MORE: Saint John mayor, organization of municipalities call for broad changes to N.B. tax system
“If we were taxed for the heavy equipment that exists in this city, the tax rate would less than a dollar,” Lowe said. “People would want to move here”.
Despite the stable tax rate, this is a difficult budget with cost-cutting measures across the board as the city grapples with a deficit of more than $3 million and a structural deficit at $6 million. That's something the city manager says will lead to service reductions.
Most publicized is a combined $2.5-million reduction in the police and fire departments. A reduction the police union has already suggested will mean officers are removed from street crime, traffic and community service units.
“It is certainly a dark day in the 69-year history of the Saint John Police Force, one that has officers severely demoralized and the public shocked, all the public that we have talked to,” said Saint John Police Association rep, Bob Davidson.
The Firefighters Association says it still doesn't know how budget cuts will play out.
“We don't know what our new response model is going to become Jan. 1 and I find that's just criminal,” said association president Peter Alexander.

The fire chief says they understand fiscal restraint and has suffered through it before.
“Quite frankly, we're still struggling with reductions of 2012,” explained chief Kevin Clifford. “I've been saying that since 2012 and not to have any overtime money to support fire operations is challenging”.
What wasn't expected was a letter from New Brunswick Premier Brian Gallant on Friday promising short-term relief from the province.
No financial details were officially disclosed so the budget process is to proceed as planned.
Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday slammed the Kerala State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC) acting chairperson P Mohana Das for seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the alleged custodial death of a 26-year-old youth in Kochi.
Rejecting the demand for a CBI probe, Vijayan said let the Human Rights Commission chairperson do their duty only. The Chief Minister was responding to questions on the CBI probe into the alleged custodial death of S R Sreejith at a press meet in Thiruvananthapuram.
Many of Das' statements were unbecoming of the position they hold, Vijayan said, adding it seems the statements were part of their political stand. They were appointed as acting chairperson of KSHRC by the previous Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) rule.
Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala had on Monday observed a 24-hour hunger strike seeking a CBI inquiry into the death of S R Sreejith, who had died of alleged torture in police custody on 9 April.
Sreejith, who was taken into custody in connection with the death of a person early this month, had died in a private hospital. Their relatives alleged that they died due to torture, but the police have rejected the allegation saying Sreejith was suspected to have suffered injuries during a clash before they were taken into custody.
Stating that the state government took stern action against the police personnel involved in the incident, Vijayan said the instances of allegations of third-degree torture by police in Kerala was not new. But in this case, the government took immediate action against the persons responsible for it. Vijayan also said four police personnel including an inspector has been arrested and a murder case registered against them. Terming Sreejith's death as "unfortunate," Vijayan said it should not have happened in Kerala.
A Special Investigation Team was probing the incident and action would be taken if any more people were found guilty, they noted. The chief minister also rejected the charges that they had refused to meet the family members of Lithuanian tourist Liga Skromene, whose decomposed body was recovered from near Kovalam. "They (family members) have not contacted the CM's office and sought an appointment. I would have readily met them. What is preventing me from meeting them?" Vijayan said referring to reports in social media that they refused to meet Liga's relatives.
The CPM leader also pointed out that the police also took necessary steps to trace the missing women by setting up a special investigation team. Liga's sister Ilze and their husband Andrews had yesterday demanded a high-level probe into the circumstances leading to their death.
The body of Liga was found near Kovalam in Thiruvallam on 21 April from a bushy desolate area near a mangrove forest on the banks of Karmana river near in Thiruvananthapuram.
Some might say, oh, here's another Ferrari exhibition, haven't there been enough already in 2017 celebrating the company's the 70th anniversary?
Well, no, there have not.
Since mid-November and running until April 15, 2018, the Design Museum in London is hosting a spectacular Ferrari exhibit, but not one that is of the typical kind. Instead of just displaying a nice range of widely expensive and jaw-dropping Italian steeds, this museum went much more and beyond.
This is a more in-depth look into how the company fared in its early years, well documented by images and documentation, and all of it coming from private collections.
On display are such items as rare watches given out by Enzo Ferrari to their top drivers during the pre-war era under the Scuderia Ferrari banner. Present as well is Enzo's own driving license.
Divided into different sections, when you walk in you stare at a replica of the very first Ferrari ,followed by a room full of interesting documentation, such as the original drawings of the early cars and the original blueprints of the Ferrari factory.
You'll even find Enzo's Montblanc on display, remember that purple ink they were famous for using? Well, that was written with that very same fountain pen.
The next major room mostly features the design of the cars, how they are and where they were built and how the mechanical part of the cars is constructed.
Consider a recent clay model standing by a wooden buck and how the cars were built in the 1950s. There's even an alloy 250LM body hanging from the ceiling.
But again, it's the extras on display that keep drawing your attention and have you wanting to make sure you don't miss anything. When is the last time that you saw actual wind tunnel models on display, or the crankshafts from a Formula One engine, both a rough cast and a finished machined one?
Design Museum goes beneath the skin of Ferrari Enlarge Photo
Further down you will keep on finding some of the cars that created the Ferrari legend. A 166 Mille Miglia that was originally delivered to Gianni Agnelli flanked by the very first Ferrari flag that was draped outside the gate in 1948. But also a Ferrari 500 Grand Prix car, the very same car that Alberto Ascari took to victory in the 1952 British Grand Prix, which is flanked by trophy that Ascari received for that victory.
The racing car line continues with gems such as a 250GT SWB Speciale, a 250 GTO and even Schumacher's 2000-c hampionship winning Formula One car.
A line-up of helmets, all belonging to former Ferrari Formula One drivers, oozes the strong heritage of the brand.
The exhibit is popular. We suggest ordering your tickets online before you fly over. You will not be disappointed!

Zimbabwe's military vowed Wednesday to stay neutral in upcoming elections and denied it would influence nationwide voting scheduled for July 30 as the opposition said it would not contest unfair polls.
by Reagan MASHAVAVE
The military is under close scrutiny following its brief takeover in November that led to the resignation of former president Robert Mugabe.
Previous elections under Mugabe were marred by violence, intimidation and fraud — often alleged to involve the security forces.
“The Zimbabwe Defence Forces has no direct role in the upcoming elections,” said army spokesperson Overson Mugwisi at a media conference in Harare ahead of the presidential, parliamentary and local polls.
“We are disturbed by false reports alleging that the Zimbabwe Defence Forces is going to be used by (the ruling) ZANU-PF to rig the posted vote.”
Following the military's statement, the leader of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party Nelson Chamisa said it would not participate in unfair elections and raised the prospect of calling for the election to be run by an outside body.
“We will not go into an election that has its own machinations,” they said, casting doubt on the work of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission but signalling their support for the military.
“We are going to be tempted to ask the South African Development Community (SADC) and African Union (AU) to take over” organising the vote, said Chamisa, referring to the regional and continental blocs.
– ‘Violence-free but illegitimate election' –
They also called for the ZEC, which they have previously accused of being heavily staffed by regime supporters, to store and distribute ballot papers more transparently.
“We therefore call upon SADC, the AU and the international community to intervene and save a collapsing process and abate an imminent legitimacy crisis,” they said.
The army appears to have staged its media briefing in response to a report in the Standard daily that it had deployed active service personnel to rural areas to campaign for candidates in ZANU-PF primary contests.
The Standard said it had received complaints from defeated contenders for the ZANU-PF slate.
They reported that some winning candidates who were former senior military officers had been “roping in the army to win the primary elections,” it said.
“If some serving members are participating in the ongoing political campaigns, they will be doing so illegally and not as a result of an instruction from their commanders,” said Mugwisi.
“The conduct of the Zimbabwe Defence forces after elections is going to be guided by the constitution.”
July's polls will be the first ballot box test for Mnangagwa, and the first since Mugabe was forced to resign after 37 years in power.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, has pledged to hold free and fair elections as they seek to mend international relations.
But the main opposition remains unconvinced by their stated commitment to democratic standards.
“What we are currently witnessing is a regime that simply talks but does not intend to hold credible elections. We are moving towards a violence-free but illegitimate election,” added Chamisa.
But Chamisa signalled their faith in the military, saying they were “not worried”.
“They are a patriotic army. They are a professional army, I work with the army very well. In fact, I respect them,” they said. DM
Walt Disney Co.'s planned acquisition of much of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox media company — a deal that is expected to be completed this week — could prompt a brain drain of high-level Fox executives in the coming months.
Among the prominent executives who eventually could exit Fox is 20th Century Fox Chair Stacey Snider as well as Fox Television Group Chair Dana Walden.
Amazon.com has had individual discussions with the two executives to gauge their interest in becoming chief executive of Amazon Studios in Santa Monica, according to four knowledgeable people who were not authorized to discuss the situation.
Snider and Walden are two of Hollywood's most high-powered and successful female studio chiefs, which makes them incredibly marketable at a time when more than a dozen men in Hollywood have fallen following sexual harassment allegations.
The talks with Amazon, which occurred during the last month, are said to be preliminary. Both women remain under contract at Fox.
Amid worries of a brain drain, Fox Chief Executive James Murdoch last week began reaching out to several key business leaders in an effort to extend their employment at Fox so they would serve through any transition to Disney's ownership, according to two people familiar with the situation.
One of Amazon's top executives is leading the search and has talked to several veteran Hollywood executives as the company begins the process of finding a new creative chief to replace Roy Price, who left Amazon in October following a sexual harassment allegation.
Amazon, according to one of the sources, is not in any hurry to fill the position, in part because several of the top prospects are currently under contract at other companies.
In addition, Amazon Studios has leadership in place. Albert Cheng, a prominent media executive who previously oversaw many of ABC's digital efforts, has been interim chief since Price's departure.
An Amazon spokesperson was not immediately available.
Speculation over the future of Snider, who took charge of the 20th Century Fox film studio last year, has intensified because few think they would move over to Disney. The Burbank studio has its own film team in place, including the highly respected chairperson of Walt Disney Studios, Alan Horn.
Snider has been credited with reinvigorating Fox's studio but they had a mixed track record when they worked as co-chief executive of Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios, which had a distribution deal with Disney.
Several Fox insiders speculated that Disney might be more interested in bringing over Emma Watts, Fox's president of production. Earlier this year, Watts was elevated to vice chairperson of Fox's film studio.
The Amazon Studios position might not be the only coveted Hollywood position up for grabs. AT&T is trying to buy Time Warner Inc., which could lead to open positions at Warner Bros. studio.

Walden is one of the most successful executives in Hollywood. They have worked at Fox more than two decades and has strong relationships with key television producers, including Ryan Murphy. They and fellow Fox Television Group Chair Gary Newman are credited with building 20th Century Fox Television into a powerhouse, churning out such hits as “This is Us,” “Empire,” “Modern Family,” “Homeland” and “Family Guy.”
Disney is highly interested in Fox's television studio, which a recent report by Bernstein & Co. analyst Todd Juenger called “the crown jewel" of 21st Century Fox.
For the last three years, Walden and Newman also have been running the Fox broadcast network, which will likely remain within the Murdoch family's portfolio following the proposed merger.
Brain drains are common in high-level mergers.
“Anytime a merger like this happens, people start dusting off their resumes,” said James R. Bailey, a professor of leadership development at George Washington University School of Business. “You are going to see a talent drain at Fox,” they predicted. This is exactly the time for top talent to move on.”
Murdoch — and their sons Lachlan and James Murdoch — sent a note to employees late last week, acknowledging the angst caused by a potential sale to Disney.
“While we can't comment on market speculation, we do want to address the impact we know this is having on all of you,” the Murdochs said in an email late Thursday. “Uncertainty always breeds unease. In every way, our focus is on our businesses and on the welfare of all our colleagues.”
James Murdoch has reached out to several executives to reassure them, people familiar with the matter said.
“All of you have worked hard to build and nurture a remarkable company through your hard work, loyalty and creativity,” the Murdochs said. “For this we are truly grateful.”

Immigration advocates held a demonstration Monday in downtown Los Angeles to call on lawmakers to pass sanctuary policies, and to urge L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell to stop cooperating with immigration officials.
The rally is part of the “Caravan Against Fear.” Monday's stop was one of the last two that a coalition of community leaders, immigration advocates, labor groups and workers are making in California before traveling to Arizona, New Mexico and Texas for similar rallies.
At the Hall of Justice, where McDonnell's office is located, demonstrators clapped, chanted and banged on drums. Some wore brown shirts with the image of a bear and the words “ICE out of California. Support SB 54!” while others held large banners. At least three men wore werewolf masks and dressed as deputies, holding a sign that said,“Hunting immigrants.”
Organizers said they chose to make at stop at the Hall of Justice because McDonnell has been cooperating with immigration officials and opposes a proposed state bill that would increase protection for immigrants living in the country illegally.
“He was elected to serve all of the communities and was elected to ensure that there is trust within the community to report crime, to report sexual assault, to report domestic violence,” said Sandra Diaz, vice president of the SEUI's United Service Workers West, which represents security officers and airport workers.

McDonnell, whose parents moved to Boston from Ireland a year before they were born, has expressed sympathy for immigrants trying to make a better life in America. But they do not support a “sanctuary state” bill that protects immigrants without legal status. The bill, SB 54, is being pushed by Democratic leaders in response to policies enacted by President Trump.
McDonnell believes that if cooperation with immigration officers ends, those federal agents will instead shift their operations to the streets, instilling fear and causing immigrants not to cooperate with law enforcement in criminal cases.
“For me, this is not about politics, but rather, it is about protecting people,” McDonnell said in a statement late Monday. “I feel an obligation to stand up for what I believe will protect individuals in all of our communities.
“We need to use all tools available, including our law enforcement partners ... to ensure the protection of individuals and their families from serious and violent offenders,” they said. “If ICE is not given access to the jails where the most serious and violent offenders are housed, then, very predictably, ICE agents will have no other alternative but to seek out their targets and make their arrests in our communities.”
Other sheriffs, including Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens, have voiced similar objections to the bill. The California State Sheriff's Assn. opposes it.
But those demonstrating outside of the Hall of Justice say they're already seeing immigration officers in their communities, where they have nabbed and deported people who were not the intended targets. Those actions are already instilling the very fear McDonnell says they are trying to prevent.
“If they were focusing just on illegal immigrants who are criminals I would understand,” said Carlos Hernandez, a janitor in Los Angeles. “But they're not doing that. They're going after everyone.”
“We already see the collaboration with ICE,” said Graciela Lopez, 30, a union member. “They're showing up at courthouses.”
Some demonstrators disagreed about who should be protected. Lopez and a few others said all immigrants, regardless of what crimes they may have committed, deserve protection. But Hernandez and others say they don't mind if law enforcement officials target people who have committed serious felonies.
Most said it's not up to law enforcement to enforce immigration laws.

Two years ago, months after L.A. County officials voted to limit their interaction with immigration officials and find other ways to cooperate with them, McDonnell authorized such agents to operate inside jails and look for immigrants in the country illegally who have committed serious or violent crimes.
McDonnell's policy was established months after the July 2015 shooting of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. Steinle, 32, was shot in the back by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a immigrant living in the country illegally and who had previously been deported five times. The shooting sparked debate over San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city.
The names and fingerprints of people booked into L.A. County jails are sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who then select the inmates they want to pick up. The Sheriff's Department also forwards lists of inmates who are scheduled to be released soon.
Last year, L.A. County jail officials handed over about 1,000 inmates of the 300,000 who were released. But those policies would change if SB 54, also referred to as the “sanctuary bill,” passes.
The bill was introduced by Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De León (D-Los Angeles) and would limit the information ICE receives about inmates in county jails. The bill would also prohibit law enforcement from sharing databases with ICE or provide an inmate's release date.
Hold requests, which are typically used by ICE to request an inmate and allow the inmate to be held for an extra 48 hours, would be barred under the bill. Requests to notify ICE of an inmate's release date or help with an inmate's transfer would also be barred by the bill.
Law enforcement would still be able to let federal agents know about inmates who have been convicted of certain violent felonies, but the list of crimes is narrower than currently allowed by state law. And the notification would be made to the FBI, not ICE.
At the corner of Temple and Spring streets, immigration advocates gave speeches while federal court employees watched from the windows of Hall of Justice. Two large red balloons held a banner that read “Jim McDonnell, whose side are you on?” and a picture of the state and Trump were between the word “or.”
Watching with amusement was John Hernandez of Pico Rivera, who was in the downtown L.A. area and came across the demonstration.
What drives visitors' enquiries to play at your course? Here we look at two venues that saw a surge of interest in 2017 and ask them: ‘Why?'
Last year Kingsbarns Golf Links said it welcomed more guests to Scotland's east coast in 2017 than ever before.
The club's annual results show an upward curve in rounds in 2017, and follow on from an increase recorded in 2016. The year-on-year figures are, according to its chief executive, underpinned by a commitment to consistent and continual improvement.
“The fact we recorded more rounds than any other year is testament to a consistent approach,” noted Alan Hogg. “Welcoming the world's best players to Scotland [the club hosted the 2017 Ricoh Women's British Open] was a privilege that all the team at Kingsbarns enjoyed. It is, however, an approach we adopt day in, day out with our guests. The standard of service doesn't alter.”
Investment in the course has also paid off.
“The green speeds at Kingsbarns were some of the most consistent we have had during tournament testing,” said Richard Windows, STRI agronomy services manager. “It was a great example of the implementation of good agronomic practices executed by a team of expert greenkeepers.”
“Our policy is to present Kingsbarns to the highest possible standard throughout the year,” explained course manager Innes Knight. “It could be a mid-week match for local golfers, a four-ball of international tourists or the closing Sunday of a major. It does not matter. All members of staff at Kingsbarns are committed to delivering a truly unique golf experience for all our guests.”
Art Dunkley, director of Kingsbarns, agreed. “We continually seek to improve how we present Kingsbarns and welcome our visiting golfers.”
Meanwhile, Carden Park in Cheshire also saw a surge of interest from seasoned golfers looking for a first-rate day of golf as well as keen young amateurs keen to learn, enjoy and develop their game.
General manager of Carden Park, Paul Bayliss, said: “The rise in enquiries we feel is due to the changing status of golf in that it is fast becoming popular among younger and, to an ever-growing degree, female players. A recent study found there were 95,000 adult female golfers and over 40,000 juniors in England, which is amongst the highest numbers in Europe.”
PGA professionals Steve Priest, Mike Platt and Ian Rowlands host weekly golf lessons with local schools and also introductory lessons on weekends to help grow the game.
Golf business manager, Jason Davies, said: “We have fantastic facilities and coaches onsite to help with all levels of golfers, we want to help introduce as many youngsters to the game as it's one of our main goals.”
West Ham United manager David Moyes is sensitive towards goalkeeper Joe Hart's situation but adamant that their team selection is based purely on getting results for the club.
Hart, who is on loan from Manchester City, was replaced by Adrian for West Ham's defeat by the Premier League leaders this month and the Spaniard's performance earned them a starting role in the shock 1-0 win over champions Chelsea.
Moyes looks likely to stick with Adrian for Wednesday's game against Arsenal but a continued lack of first-team action will leave Hart in danger of losing out on a place in England's World Cup squad.
"I always have compassion for the players as well, that's why it wasn't an easy decision on Joe," Moyes told reporters. "But, ultimately, it's West Ham I have to get results for."
“He wasn't happy. I told them the reason why and that happens at clubs all over the country. It's a manager's job. When I came in, I said I will tell you straight, I wouldn't kid anybody.”
West Ham are 18th in the table.
“Joe is incredibly experienced. World Cup, Champions League football,” Moyes said.
“So he's such an important player for us... they want to play but I've got to do what's best for West Ham, pick the players I think will get us a result.”
LOS ANGELES:- Disney has cut ties with YouTube's most watched blogger PewDiePie for posting several videos containing anti-Semitic remarks and Nazi references, the Wall Street Journal said Tuesday. The 27-year-old Swede, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, is known for posting humorous clips to their more than 53 million followers on YouTube. “Although Felix has created a following by being provocative and irreverent, they clearly went too far in this case and the resulting videos are inappropriate,” a spokesperson for Maker Studios, the Disney division that had partnered with PewDiePie, told the Journal.
PewDiePie, who had editorial independence under the terms of the arrangement with Disney, reportedly paid two Indian men five dollars to hold the banner reading “Death to all Jews” while they laugh and dance in the January 11 video. “I was trying to show how crazy the modern world is, specifically some of the services available online,” Kjellberg said in a Tumblr blog post on February 12. “I picked something that seemed absurd to me - that people on Fiverr would say anything for 5 dollars,” referring to a website that helps freelancers receive part time work. The Journal said PewDiePie had posted nine videos that display anti-Semitic jokes and Nazi references since August. One of them shows a man dressed as Jesus Christ, saying “Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong”. “I think it's important to say something and I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes,” the YouTube star said in the blog post. “Though this was not my intention, I understand that these jokes were ultimately offensive,” they added. Kjellberg is a top earner on YouTube, making roughly $14.5 million (13.6 million euros) last year, according to reported estimates from social media data firm NeoReach. That amount includes splitting ad revenue with YouTube, as well as sponsorships and appearance fees. In December, PewDiePie accused YouTube of trying to “kill” their channel and has threatened to shut it down once they reach 50 million subscribers, a move that turned out to be a publicity stunt.
LOS ANGELES (AP)  Los Angeles prosecutors have begun presenting evidence against New York real estate heir Robert Durst before a judge decides if he'll face trial for an old murder case.
Prosecutors called an 85-year-old New York City doctor Tuesday as a conditional witness in case something happens to them before trial.
Dr. Albert Kuperman worked at the medical school where Durst's first wife was a student when they disappeared in 1982.
Durst is charged with murder in the 2000 death of a friend who was their unofficial spokesperson after their wife went missing.

The 74-year-old Durst walked into court for the first time. They have previously been rolled in by wheelchair.
Prosecutors also plan to call a secret witness they haven't publicly named who they say fears Durst could have them killed.
KARACHI - Pakistan People's Party Karachi President Dr Asim Hussain on Friday returned to Pakistan after an almost two month stay in London for medical treatment and said that they had proved their critics wrong who said that they would not return to the country.
They were welcomed by Deputy Speaker Sindh Assembly and PPP Karachi Information Secretary Shehla Raza, and other local PPP leadership at Jinnah International Airport.
Addressing media at Karachi Airport, Dr Hussain took a jibe at PML-N leadership and said that they belong to PPP whose leadership always remained within the masses in difficult times and they are not the ones who would run away from the country like Nawaz Sharif.
“We are the ones who saved the country in past and will repeat the same thing in future also,” they said
They further said that Nawaz Sharif is at loggerheads with the army which is not a good sign for the country.
“Nawaz Sharif should refrain from any confrontation with the army otherwise PPP would stand alongside its armed forces,” they said adding that they had themselves listened to Nawaz Sharif using abusing language for the army.
They said that the army had given a clear message through its silence that it do not want to indulge in the politics.
They said that the politics of Nawaz Sharif was only for commission and their due share in the projects. “The PML-N leader wants to take the country 200 years back.”
The former petroleum minister said that that there is a difference between the actions and words of the PML-N leadership.
Responding to a question, the PPP leader alleged that the PML-N leadership wants to put into action their design of ‘Greater Punjab' “The PML-N leader want a piece of land where they could run the state like their kingdom,” they alleged.

Fab memories and great times. That's what you thought about our photograph of the West View Majestic Coronets jazz band in Hartlepool.
Thanks to the 5,000 of you who spotted our photo of the band from 1989 when we posted it on social media.
The West View Majestic Coronets at a competition at the Old Friarage in 1989.
Many of you took time to take a closer look and commented on the ‘big family' that was the Coronets.
Joanne Whitelock said: “The thing I loved most is it was like a big family we trained hard and loved the competitions on a weekend.”
Joanne added; “I am in the back row, second in from the right.”
And they wanted to pay tribute to one very special couple for their kindness and support for the band.
Made some lifelong friends from my jazzband days. Every weekend we would travel to different towns and put on a parade and display competing against other jazz bands Diane Watson
Joanne said: “The lady and gentleman who ran our band Eddie Glass and Sheila Glass welcomed us all into their homes for pie and pea suppers, bingo and made us all feel like one of their own.
“They worked really hard to keep the band going. Thanks for the memories.”
Diane Watson described them as “Awww fab memories” and added: “Mam would be so proud to know that the jazz band is still being spoked about.”
They later commented: “My mam and dad ran this jazz band.”
The West View Majestic Coronets.
Diane is in the picture and pointed out: “I was Band Major, front right in white.”
They described their time in the West View Majestic Coronets as “the best days of my life. We were one big happy family.”
Diane added: “Made some lifelong friends from my jazzband days. Every weekend we would travel to different towns and put on a parade and display competing against other jazz bands.”
Once a year, said Diane, “we would go away for a whole week to Great Yarmouth or Wales to compete. Fab memories that I can cherish forever.
“My mam is no longer here now but they would be so proud to know that West View Majestics are still being spoked about to this day.”
Lots of people liked the social media post including Michelle Clayton, Shirley Carter, Angela Charlton, Debbie Leighton, Leanne Inglis, Alisha Glass and June Lowes.
So did Brian Hart, Louise Charlton, Debbie Carter, Dawn Barclay, Stephen Collins, Adele Wilkinson and Paul Moore.
We thank them all as well as Mandy Rowley who was a member of the majestics and said: “Loved being in this jazz band. Loved Sheila and Eddie.”
The Majestics were a much-loved jazz band and we are hoping to hear from more people keen on sharing memories.
Or perhaps there is another band you would like us to look back on, in the Hartlepool or East Durham areas.

Everyday, we are inching closer to some kind of Artificial Intelligence.
At this point, it isn't so important whether we're talking about truly self-conscious machines or not. Advances in big data, machine learning and robotics are all poised to give us a world where computers are effectively intelligent in terms of how we deal with them.
Should you be scared by this proposition? Based on a lecture I just attended, my answer is: "Absolutely, but not in the usual 'robot overlords' kind of way."
Instead, the real fear should be about getting human beings wrong, not getting AI right.
The lecture I attended was given by Dr. Rana el Kaliouby.  They are a brilliant scientist who works on giving computers the ability recognize the emotions of humans they interact with. More than just an academic, they are also an entrepreneur. El Kaliouby is CEO of Affectiva a company whose "AI humanizes how people and technology interact."
But while El Kaliouby's presentation was thrilling (she is a truly engaging speaker), the longer the lecture went on, the more troubled I became.
The essence of the technology Affectiva pioneers is the ability of computers to recognize human emotions based on the "activation" of muscles in the face. The link between facial expressions and emotions is, of course, something we humans all know how to read. But researchers have gone beyond the gross characteristics of "smile" vs. "frown" to map out groups of facial muscles and their links to specific emotional states. The AI built by Affectiva can identify the positions of facial muscles and uses them to infer the emotional state of its user. Then the machine responds in ways that take that emotional state into account (the company is also working on identifying emotions using speech.)
One potential application for the technology's use would be to provide "emotional robots" for the elderly. Having a machine that could converse in an empathic way would give an older person without much human contact "someone" to spend time with.
The fact that this is even possible is pretty remarkable and serves as a testimony to how far and how fast our machines have come in the ability to react to environments (including us). But as more potential applications of the technology were discussed in El Kaliouby's lecture, the more it became clear to me how the technology is also a kind of trap we are preparing for ourselves.
We often like to say that technology is "value free." Scientists make their discoveries and engineers build their inventions and these are all free of "values." It's society that adds those in. But I have never bought fully into that equation. All research occurs in cultural settings. Why are some research questions considered important (and worthy of funding) while others are deemed uninteresting? The answer to this question is always colored by the culture in which the researchers live.
More importantly, research programs can come with a raft of philosophical baggage. These underpin the assumptions made in developing and carrying forward those programs. The assumption that lies behind emotional computing technologies is that facial states capture emotions. From the computers point of view they are emotions. At the root of this equation is a reduction of human experience to neural programming whose outward manifestation can be captured algorithmically.
The point here is not to begin an argument about the nature of consciousness. Instead, it's to see how technologies like Affectiva have built-in assumptions about what we are as humans. As the technologies are deployed in the world they can reframe the world. In this way, technologies can rewire society in ways that can be hard to escape from. If you want an example, just think iPhones and social media.
So imagine we get robots that keep lonely, older people company. That's a good thing right? But won't that also relieve us from questioning how we ended up in a society that warehouses the elderly because we don't know what else to do with them? Might there be other, more humane — and human — solutions than robots (that will be sold at a steep price by the robot companies)?
Another example given in the lecture was something along the lines of allowing a family to watch different versions of the same show but each version gets tuned, in real time, to that family member's emotions. Perhaps the computer senses that brother wants a happy ending but sis wants everyone to die. I found this idea more than a little horrifying. It's not as if we don't live in our own bubbles enough now. Why provide more means to pull us away from shared experience?
This led to another troublesome problem. The technology will clearly have useful applications, like developing learning apps for kids with autism. But it will be in the domains of sales and coercion that it finds its greatest deployment. Our "emotion data" will be used against us to make money, or worse, for someone else.
But, at the root of it all, is the fact that "emotion data" is not the same thing as the real, vivid, present, enacted emotional experiences we have being human. Our emotions are not our faces or our voices. They aren't data. They can't be pulled out like a thread, one by one, from the fabric of our being.
But once a technology that treats emotions as data becomes pervasive, we may soon find that data is the only aspect of emotion we come to recognize or value. Once billions of dollars flood into that equation, we may find ourselves trapped in a pervasive technology that flattens our experiences and reduces our lives.
And that, more than robot overlords, is what scares me about AI.

Ahh, the Super Bowl rematch.
We don't get those too often. At least, we rarely see them the ensuing fall. And this one just happens to be a replay of arguably the greatest -- or at least most stunning -- Super Sunday of all time. Falcons at Patriots will mark just the third time in two decades -- and the seventh time ever -- that the two Super Bowl combatants meet in the very next regular season.
And that's just one game from the intriguing slate the league will feature in 2017. After carefully studying every team's regular-season opponents, I came up with the top 17 matchups of 2017.
Some of the old, familiar retreads got no love this time around. There's room for a few unusual contests pitting new coach against old team, as well as a showdown between quarterbacks drafted in succession. So take a look, tell me what I missed: @HarrisonNFL is the place.
17) San Francisco 49ers at Washington Redskins
I can't help myself, putting this seemingly innocuous NFC matchup on the list. Seemingly innocuous, that is, until you think about a certain signal caller ... Will Kirk Cousins be in a 49ers uniform? Perhaps not, as the possibility they get traded seems to get more remote by the day. That said, if the Redskins don't deal him, they might get a third-round compensatory pick next offseason when Cousins bolt for the Niners (... in theory, of course). How will Cousins handle those questions leading up to the game? We should mention: Pierre Garçon will be going up against their former team. Get excited.
16) Denver Broncos at Miami Dolphins
Vance Joseph goes against the team whose defense they led last season. Can Joseph direct the Broncos' defensive unit the way Wade Phillips did over the last two seasons? This game should be evenly matched, although the Broncos have a better opportunity to make the postseason via winning the AFC West. (The Dolphins, of course, play in the AFC New England -- I mean, AFC East.) Is Ryan Tannehill ready to take that proverbial step forward in Year 2 of Adam Gase's offense? This matchup will be quite telling on that front. By the way, Joseph said at the NFL's Annual League Meeting, "My belief system is Wade's." Sounds cool. Will their defensive results mirror Wade's? And how much will Joseph's former defense take it to the young quarterbacks John Elway's rolling with?
15) Buffalo Bills at Carolina Panthers
Another seemingly random matchup, but intriguing on the coaching front. Sean McDermott was given much credit for the Panthers' ascension from NFC South champ to Super Bowl team in the 2015 season. Although the Panthers disappointed in 2016, McDermott still had enough juice to land their first head-coaching gig. This is the kind of interconference slugfest the Bills need to win to be a playoff team. (Think of the heartbreaking loss in Seattle last season.) Tyrod Taylor vs. Cam Newton is interesting, as well. Taylor stays in the pocket more, but is they really far behind Newton as a complete player? Newton has been more ballyhooed for their athleticism and such, while no one seemed too excited about the Bills sticking with Tyrod. Seems out of balance to me.
14) New Orleans Saints at Green Bay Packers
There are three certifiable Halls of Fame quarterbacks in the NFL right now: Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers (with Ben Roethlisberger a likely candidate). With the Packers and Saints not in the same division, and Brees 38 years old, there won't be too many more meetings between them and Rodgers. Last time these two faced off, they combined for a mere 765 yards passing and seven touchdowns. The year before, they locked horns in a heckuva contest to kick off the season that ended with a goal-line stand. The Packers' offense should present quite the challenge for a New Orleans defense Sean Payton has focused on improving.
13) Chicago Bears at Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Perhaps no signing made people put the thinking emoji -- or the upside-down emoji (my personal favorite) -- in their tweets more than Mike Glennon signing with the Bears for what felt like 50 billion dollars. OK, so it was only $15 million per year on what ultimately was deemed a team-friendly deal. While Glennon's (good) fortune revealed what the quarterback market commands in 2017, it also provides them an opportunity to prove they are a commodity, not simply a viable starter. Glennon was decent in Tampa, but not many young quarterbacks can fend off a team using the No. 1 pick on a worthy quarterback. Jameis Winston's talent demanded the Bucs take him. Has general QB demand truly overinflated the price tag on a guy like Glennon? They will show all of us, including their former team.
12) First Los Angeles Chargers home game
While the Chargers' move to Los Angeles was met with a collective yawn, what you haven't heard is that many of us are wondering what it will be like to watch an NFL team in what could be deemed an intimate setting -- a 30,000-seat soccer stadium. This harkens back to the early days of the AFL, or even farther back to 1940s NFL, when some teams were playing in front of those crowds at smaller venues.
11) New England Patriots at Pittsburgh Steelers
Who knows where to place this contest? These two teams have faced off three times over the past two seasons, with none of the three bouts being particularly awesome. Thus, what has looked rad on paper has turned out kinda blah on TV. The closest contest was the 2015 Kickoff Game, which was devoid of Le'Veon Bell. Ditto the majority of last season's AFC Championship Game, as Bell's gimpy groin sidelined them in the first quarter. At some point, these two AFC goliaths will play at full bore with full health, and it should be awesome. I still think, had Bell not been hurt in the 2014 regular-season finale, that Pittsburgh -- not New England -- would've played Seattle in Super Bowl XLIX.
10) Philadelphia Eagles at Los Angeles Rams
What? You're not feeling Eagles at Rams? Alright, I get it -- Philly probably will finish third in the NFC East, while the Rams might hang around the cellar of their division. Yet, this game is intriguing because it will be the first time we see Carson Wentz and Jared Goff go up against one another. In fact, we rarely see two quarterbacks drafted first and second overall play each other early in their respective careers. Marcus Mariota and Jameis Winston went at it right off the bat. Seriously -- it was their first pro game. And it was a blowout. While league observers are excited about Wentz and Dak Prescott having many meetings to come in the NFC East, everyone seems to have blown off Goff. Let's see what the guy can do in their first full season as a starter.
9) Houston Texans at Seattle Seahawks
With a premier quarterback, the Texans not only would be a contender, but it would make this Houston-Seattle matchup one of the very best games. Even without Tony Romo under center for Houston, though, this showdown offers plenty of intrigue. These two defenses should provide a fantastic game, especially with J.J. Watt and Earl Thomas healthy. Those are two of the best in the game at their respective positions. Moreover, how about last year's top-ranked defense versus the only unit in the modern era to lead the league in point allowed for four straight years (only snapping that streak this past season)? That's precisely why Texans at Seahawks is listed, because this should be one of the most physical matchups of the year. Now, imagine if Romo stepped out of the booth ... Nah.
8) Dallas Cowboys at Atlanta Falcons
The NFC Championship Game we didn't get. Unfortunately. With no offense to the Packers, Falcons at Cowboys would have been a much tighter contest, with the second-seeded Dirty Birds on the road. While Atlanta's offense will be all the Dallas defense can handle -- especially with all the Cowboys' losses in the secondary -- the Falcons never had to worry about the game being dictated to them when playing Green Bay this past January. That is precisely what happens when the Cowboys' running game gets going with Ezekiel Elliott. Still, this matchup is likely to be a track meet, and perhaps a preview of the 2017 NFC Championship Game. Cool that Matt Ryan, Dak Prescott and Elliott were all in the MVP race last year, only adding to this game's intrigue. (Now watch Devonta Freeman rush for 185 yards.)
7) New England Patriots at Tampa Bay Buccaneers
Now we're diving into the really fun matchups. Patriots at Buccaneers might not be a game that jumps off the schedule at first glance, but it should. That Tampa defense should get off to a quick start. This unit was playing great last season until the last two games, which should change with the addition of Chris Baker and the continued development of young stud Kwon Alexander. Alexander and Marcus Mariota were the toughest omissions from my All-Under-25 Team. Winston earned that prestigious honor, and should be more effective in Year 3. How serious a contender will Tampa be? This game against New England provides a useful gauge, but the Bucs could win 10-plus games. The Pats have struggled in Florida lately. No, seriously.
6) Green Bay Packers at Atlanta Falcons
Replaying a conference title game is never a bad thing, especially when the highly anticipated matchup turned out to be a total blowout on Championship Sunday. Will this rematch be a new dud in Atlanta's new digs? Doubtful -- especially with the yuck taste in Rodgers and Company's mouth after the way they played against these guys in January. Much depends on how Green Bay's pass defense holds up against Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, Mohamed Sanu and those Falcons RBs coming out of the backfield. Of course, Kyle Shanahan's departure to San Francisco could mean that offense will be slightly less track meet-ish. Then again, that man experienced an avalanche of blame from the Twitter millions following the Super Bowl, so ... we'll see?
5) Dallas Cowboys at Oakland Raiders
Any time these two teams get together -- once every four years -- it feels like classic football. Two storied franchises with eight Lombardi Trophies between them and Good-vs.-Evil history makes for fun times. Yep, nothing like the Dallas Cowboys against the Oaklllll ... eh ... uh ... Las Vegas(?) Raiders. Ugh. OK, scratch those previous sentences. At least both teams are solid, with quality quarterbacks, stud receivers and defenses that pretty much ensure the game won't be 17-13. Both organizations feel like they are on the Super Bowl's doorstep. That's awesome. And yes, it'll be even better if (when) @MoneyLynch is in the Raiders' backfield opposite Zeke running for the Cowboys.
4) Pittsburgh Steelers at Kansas City Chiefs
Easily the most intriguing of the AFC postseason rematches. While Patriots at Steelers sounds sexy, the reality is that the AFC Championship Game stunk, as did the regular-season matchup -- partially because the Steelers have been partial. (Availability is the most important ability, football fans.) Meanwhile, Pittsburgh and Kansas City locked up in an old-school, '70s-style matchup that came down to the wire (and an Eric Fisher stranglehold of Ted Nugent proportions). Chief fans thought they were robbed. The Steelers advanced. These two teams present a fascinating contrast in approach -- from coaching styles to offenses to the strengths of their defenses. Great uni matchup, too, while we're at it.
3) New England Patriots at Oakland Raiders
While the 2016 Patriots were cruising the last few weeks of their 14-2 campaign, everyone was wondering aloud who would challenge them in the AFC. The Steelers were fumbling around. No one trusted the Chiefs' passing game to take down New England. Oakland? Now that was a title threat with juice. Sure, the defense was middling, at best. But Derek Carr could keep up with Tom Brady. Not to mention head coach Jack Del Rio was gutsy enough to make for a fascinating coaching matchup. Annnnnd we ended up getting nada because Carr fell late in season. Subsequently, one half of Connor Cook football told us what we all needed to know (but didn't want to hear): Oakland was going nowhere in January without Carr. These two could see each other in the playoffs -- again. Remember their controversial postseason affairs from 1976, 1985 and 2001?
2) Seattle Seahawks at Green Bay Packers
There's been a lot of talk about Ty Montgomery becoming a permanent addition in the Green Bay backfield. Well, Eddie Lacy will take it to their former team from their new perch in the Seahawks' backfield. That makes Seahawks at Packers -- which hasn't produced wonderful games the last two years -- much more fun. How about immensely more fun? Never mind. Don't forget that, besides Russell Wilson going against Aaron Rodgers (they hold the top two career passer ratings in NFL history), Michael Bennett and Martellus Bennett will go at it, too.
1) Atlanta Falcons at New England Patriots
You gotta know this is going to be the Kickoff Game, right? The league passing on a Super Bowl rematch, when it so conveniently fits the model of the defending champion opening the new season at home? That'd be like turning down 750 million free bucks from the Strip. (Too soon?) Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe the league will want to replay the 2007 AFC Championship Game, and send the newly minted L.A. Chargers careening into Gillette. For all those who rooted hard for the Falcons during Super Bowl LI, their football hopes might be dashed again, given that this deal is not on a neutral field, the Atlanta offense will be different and Brandin Cooks could fly past the Falcons' secondary like nobody's business. So here's a piece of advice for new OC Steve Sarkisian: Run the football.

HAVANA (Reuters) - A steep drop in U.S. travellers to Cuba after a tightening of travel restrictions by President Donald Trump helped drive a 7 percent slide in foreign visitors to the Caribbean island in the first three months of 2018, Cuban official data showed on Tuesday.

The U.S. restrictions and warning on travel to the Communist-run island were to blame for the lower number of U.S. arrivals from the same period a year ago, the Cuban Tourism Ministry's commercial director, Michel Bernal, told a news conference in Havana.
Another issue affecting Cuba's tourism sector is unjustified worries about the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma last September, they said, given that the country had long since fixed its tourist installations.
“The total of U.S. clients is only 56.6 percent of what it was in 2017,” Bernal said. The state-run Cuban News Agency published the percentage decline in overall foreign visits separately, citing tourism authorities.
The number of Americans travelling to Cuba surged after former U.S. President Barack Obama reached a landmark detente with then-Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014 and eased travel restrictions while maintaining a ban on tourism.
Increased U.S. arrivals to Havana in particular fostered the rapid growth of the country's fledgling private sector, with many Cubans rushing to open bed-and-breakfasts and restaurants.
Tourism became one of the few bright spots in an economy struggling with heavy state controls, a difficult market reform process, a decline in aid from ally Venezuela and lower global commodity prices.

But Trump last year made it harder again for individual Americans to travel to Cuba, as part of their tougher stance on the country.
A few months later, their administration issued a warning on travel there because of a mysterious spate of illnesses among U.S. diplomats stationed in Havana.
Cuban officials and many foreign tourism experts maintain Cuba is one of the safest destinations in the world.
The government still hopes the number of foreign visitors will reach the 5 million mark this year, Bernal said. It rose 16.2 percent to a record 4.7 million in 2017.
The number of Cubans living abroad who travelled back to the island jumped 21 percent in the first three months of the year, they said, and was showing steady growth. Other top markets were Russia and Mexico, which grew 32 and 23 percent respectively.

Bernal said Canadians still made up the largest group of visitors to Cuba by far, although they did not give any specifics.
Alston Koch is the Star of Christmas in Colombo
A very pleased Prime Minister in a public gesture made a special presentation to Alston Koch (photo).​​
​Alston Koch's star shone brightly, but this time in Sri Lanka during Christmas and as The President's House opened its doors to celebrate Christmas with people from all religions. Alston was flown down by Srilankan Airlines and invited for performances of Christmas Carols at Temple Trees for the Prime Minister and The President at President's House by Sri Lanka Tourism Minister John Amaratunge.
Alston Koch was also a privileged guest at the opening of ‘Christmas Street' hosted by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Authority & was hosted at the Kingsbury Hotel.
Dinesh Weerakody, advisor to the Prime Minister met Alston Koch in London at the British Writer's Guild Awards & invited them to headline the festivities for Christmas 2017.
KOCH – the Star this Christmas (Source: Island)
This is not an exaggeration; singer Alston Koch was in the spotlight at all the major festive events, in Colombo – entertaining VVIPs, and the public, as well. Their opener was the Christmas carols concert at the Prime Minister's residence, at Temple Trees, where they entertained the invitees with four festive specials.Describing the event, they said it was a classy evening that had an exclusive gathering of Sri Lanka's best citizens and Ambassadors from all over the world.
The scene was equally exciting when they performed for the President and their Cabinet Ministers, at President's House.
The public got the opportunity of seeing the ‘Disco Lady' hitmaker, in action, when they made a live appearance at the Christmas Street celebrations (Green Path, Colombo 7).
At all the events, Alston's repertoire consisted of those beautiful songs, connected with Christmas.
Alston was also involved in the launch of the special double decker bus (with Minister John Amaratunga), for the festive season, and the ‘lighting up' of the City of Colombo, and the Christmas Tree, at The Arcade, by the Prime Minister.
Yes, it has certainly been an exciting festive season for Alston Koch…and there's more to come!
The star vocalist also mentioned to us that Nirj Deva, of the European Union, has invited them to perform live at the Parliament of The European Union and to present their (Alston's) credentials as Ambassador for Climate Change, in February, at the first sitting of Parliament.
“I also had some offers coming my way to do 31st night, in Colombo, but due to my prior commitments, I had to decline,” said Alston.
Good morning on Wednesday February 15, 2017. It should be National Leftover Candy day, but it's actually National Gumdrop Day and National Chewing Gum Day. It's also National Flag Day of Canada, celebrating the adoption of its current flag in 1965:
And can somebody tell me why the hockey team is called the “Maple Leafs” rather than the “Maple Leaves”?
On this day in 1923, Greece became the last country in Europe to adopt the Gregorian calendar. In 1946 ENIAC, described by Wikipedia as “the first electronic general-purpose computer” was “formally dedicated” at The University of Pennsylvania—whatever it means to dedicate a computer. (Did they break a bottle of champagne on it?) On February 15, 1971, British coins became decimalized, and, in 2001, the journal Nature published the first draft of the human genome. A Nobel Prize has not been awarded for that achievement.
Notables born on this day include Galileo (1564) and Jeremy Bentham (1748). Bentham's real mummified head and skeleton, the latter dressed up in their clothes and sitting in a chair (with a wax replica head), are still preserved at University College London; see photo below.
Also born on this day were Susan B. Anthony (1820), Ernest Shackleton (1874), Art Spiegelmann (1948), and Matt Groening (1954). I highly recommend reading Spiegelmann's Maus, a graphic novel using animals (mice, pigs and cats) to illustrate the Holocaust. It is a fantastic novel/artwork, and was the first such book to win a Pulitzer Prize (1992). This year is the 25th anniversary of the book, and you can buy a special edition at Amazon by clicking the screenshot below:
Those who died on this day include Nat King Cole (1965), Mike Bloomfield (1981), Richard Feynman (1988), Martha Gellhorn (1998), and Howard K. Smith (2002). Meanwhile in Dobrzyn, Hili insists that the loving they get from everyone is merely their due (below she's getting fusses from Marta, Elzbieta's daughter):
Marta: Hili, admit that you're spoiled by everybody. Hili: I will not admit it.
In Polish:
Marta: Przyznaj, Hili, że jesteś przez wszystkich rozpuszczana.
Hili: Nie przyznam.

Suriya 37: Lyca Productions to bankroll KV Anand directorial; Amitabh Bachchan likely to play pivotal role
Rajinikanth's 2.0 makers Lyca Productions has been confirmed to bankroll Suriya 37, the next untitled project of Suriya directed by KV Anand. The film would mark the third collaboration of Suriya and Anand after their previous outings Ayan and Maattraan. The shooting for the film is expected to start rolling from July or August after Suriya wraps up their work on the ongoing Selvaraghavan project.
"Contrary to reports, Suriya won't juggle between Selvaraghavan and KV Anand films. They would commence shooting for KV Anand film only after the completion of Suriya 36 because they will sport a different look for Suriya 37. KV Anand has already begun work on the pre-production," a source told Firstpost.
Anand has already clarified that Suriya 37 would be a fresh script and will not be a sequel to Ayan. There are also unconfirmed reports that Anand is making an effort to bring Amitabh Bachchan on board for a pivotal role in the film.
Suriya is currently busy shooting for the yet-to-be-titled Selvaraghavan project which is being produced by Dream Warrior Pictures owned by SR Prabhu, who is hailed as the best Tamil film producer of 2017 for churning out critically and commercially acclaimed flicks such as Aruvi, Maanagaram and Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru. The team has shot briefly in Chennai and will head to Tanjore for the next leg of shooting, where a major chunk of scenes will be canned. Starring Rakul Preet and Sai Pallavi as female leads, Suriya 36 has music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The makers have already announced that the film will hit the screens for Diwali 2018 alongside Vijay's Thalapathy 62 with AR Murugadoss and Ajith's Viswasam with director Siva. Jagapathi Babu, who was earlier roped in for Selvaraghavan's now-shelved film Kaan, is in talks to play the villain in Suriya 36.

Ask 41-year-old Sterling K. Brown, who just took the Emmy for lead actor in a drama for their role in “This Is Us,” how they developed their awesome abs and a spectacular devotion to lifelong fitness, and he'll point to their relatives.
The aunt who paid them to do sit-ups, a dad who died way too early, and an older brother who challenged them to keep what they had. The father of two, who stars in the upcoming biopic “Marshall”— out Oct. 13 — and the 2018 movies “The Predator” and “Black Panther,” talked to us about those abs, how they ban bad food from their house, and their crazy-hard workouts.
BSHG4TcgYZm
1. Your killer abs got a big buzz when you posted on Instagram earlier this year. How'd you get them?
I've had ‘em for a long time — since age 6. As a kid in St. Louis, I remember playing shirts versus skins at summer camp — and not wanting to be a skin because I didn't like my body. So when my aunt bought us a sit-up board, it was an opportunity. They would always have competitions between us kids. She'd give 10 bucks to anyone who could do 100 sit-ups. For a 6-,7-, 8-year-old, that was a lotta money! So I once did 200 sit-ups without stopping — and got $20. From that point forward, I would watch music videos on MTV and try to do sit-ups for an entire song.

2. So you're not one of those actors who pig out most of the time and then gets fit to play a certain role?
Right. I told my wife [actor Ryan Michelle Bathe], “You know, I'm thankful that most of these roles I get have very little to do with the way I'm built.” And they said, “Are you kidding me? I would love to get roles because people want to see my body.” So we have an inverse relationship to the way we see our fitness. But for me, it's always been about being healthy.
I've seen the men in my family all start out young very fit and healthy and over time let themselves go. I always had it in the back of my mind: It's easier to maintain it than to lose it and try to get it back. I was a good high school athlete, played football and basketball and always had a decent shape. I weighed 197 when I graduated and am 190-something right now. I just wanted to stay slim, stay fit and stay tough to show my family that there is another way of aging. That you can age without growing old — that you can maintain a sense of vivacity to your lifestyle. Age doesn't have to keep you from being an active participant in life.
3. Did it work? Did you influence them to get healthier?
Maybe … to a small extent. The lifestyle in St. Louis, Mo., is not very active. Of my four siblings, my 54-year-old brother, a pharmaceutical salesperson — former track star, martial artist, college football player — will hit the elliptical. They were built like an Adonis — not anymore — but they probably inspired me more than I did him.
They would always tease me. "By the time you hit 30, you won't have those abs anymore. You'll be going out to all these corporate dinners and you'll see.” I said, “OK, we'll see.” When I turned 30, I told him, “Hey, man, I still got ‘em.” Then they said, “Just wait until you turn 40.” So when I turned 40, I sent them a picture just to show them I still had 'em.
4. You're over 40, an age when some people start slowing down. Have you changed anything?
I still do something nearly every day. I want to hold on to what the good Lord has blessed me with — that's my motto. I haven't slowed down — still love basketball, running, working out. But now, instead of banging in the paint, I've become more of a perimeter player to reduce body contact. It's a big change. Until age 38, I played with reckless abandon, or “RA,” as we called it in high school; go all-out, with total disregard for your body, and it will take care of you. But at 38, I noticed: Driving the lane and playing outdoors on the pavement instead of playing indoors on the wood, my body would tell me: “Hey, Brown, why are you doing this to me? Stop beating me up.” I'd go for a 7-8-mile run on the street, instead of the treadmill, and every time, my body would say, “Hey, Brown …”
So a good rule of thumb: Beware of the pavement. The recovery time on a more forgiving surface like wood or dirt is much less. There is no sense, with the busy schedule I have now, to go through the day hurt. A little sore, OK; hurt, no.
5. Do you do any fitness activities with your kids, or are they too young?
Actually, I'll take my 6-year-old son out and we exercise together. I'll push them just enough to where they want to come back and do it again. We'll go a park with a one-third-mile track. They like running. I'll say, “OK, big boy, I'm going to give you a 30-second head start. Then, Daddy's going to go all out to try to catch you.” And they take off. He's fast. Sometimes I catch him, sometimes I don't.
Afterwards, we might do wall jumps, pushups, squats. At some point, he'll go, “Daddy, my legs don't work anymore.” And I'll say, “You can take a break while I keep going.” I try to expose them to fitness at an early age — not just to sports — but what it means to live a healthy lifestyle. That way, although they may not be able to play sports the rest of their life or have the facility for it, they can always take care of himself. That's of tantamount importance
6. What's your diet strategy?
I remember at 16 doing a 7-mile run and was so proud of myself that I came house and made myself a pitcher of Kool-Aid. Now that doesn't even make sense.
I began to get away from the fast-food lifestyle when I became an actor in college and grad school. There was an emphasis on your body being your instrument, and I began to understand the car analogy of thinking of food as fuel you put in your engine. If you want to go long and go hard, you have to give it the best gas possible. Then, about 10 years ago, I read a book, “Healthy at 100” by John Robbins, which follows pockets of centenarians across the globe and what they have in common. The conclusion: The longest-living ate a plant-based diet with lean meat and whole grains. They didn't do hard-core, beat-your-body-up exercise but had built-in activity in their lifestyle that keeps them supple and mobile. That book sort of flipped the switch in me, made me think about the legacy I'll want to pass to my children.
One big thing: Water. I'll drink almost a gallon a day — great for my skin. Another rule: Keep out the bad stuff. No white pastas, flour or sugar in my house. We'll eat brown rice, not white. Pop-Tarts used to be a regular thing, but if I opened the box, I'd probably finish it all. Keeping it out of the house is the key
7. Your father died when you were 10. Did that play any role in your health consciousness?
Yes — a big one. My dad had [Type 2] diabetes, smoked, drank and passed from a heart attack. So I've never smoked a cigarette. I enjoy a cocktail every now and then but have no need to have a drink every day. I'm very careful with salt. We sweeten everything in our house with brown rice syrup, agave and honey, but no sugar. My kids have never seen a sugar-frosted flake. My son wouldn't know what Cap'n Crunch was if they looked at it.
I'm not just looking good for the sake of looking good. I want to live a long, healthy life. The life expectancy of the African American male is the shortest of all groups in this country, and I don't wish to be a statistic. I want to be around to see great-grandchildren — and be able to enjoy them.
The secret to Sterling K. Brown's Instagram-ready abs
Actor Sterling K. Brown's schedule can be hectic, and their workouts vary week to week. “No week is the same,” they said. “I do a lot of muscle-confusion body-weight stuff, where I keep it different so my body doesn't get used to any one thing.” They said they aim to balance it all by working out most weekdays and “taking the weekend off to hang out with the family.” Here's what a recent week of workouts looked like:
Monday: “I did the one workout I love, the ‘50-40-30-20-10-10.' A friend of mine told me about it. It means 50 jumping jacks, 40 squats, 30 push-ups, 20 butt-ups [a core workout move], 10 burpees and 10 pull-ups. Do three sets in a row. I did it in 28 minutes, with 24 minutes my PR.”
Tuesday: “Played basketball, my workout without thinking about working out. 90 minutes of fun.”
Wednesday: “Ran 4 miles on a treadmill, incline of 2% lowering to 1% as I sped up.” Done in 34 minutes, burn 1,150 calories per hour, according to the dashboard. “My PR is just under 32 minutes.”
Friday: The 50-40-30-20-10-10 workout.
Thursday: On a plane, traveling, so no workout.
Sunday: “Ran 5 miles in 42 minutes, followed by some ab exercises from P90X.”

Kang Kyung-hwa (Yonhap)
President Moon Jae-in on Thursday hinted that they would not give up Foreign Minister nominee Kang Kyung-wha, urging opposition parties to cooperate in handling their parliamentary confirmation process.He also underlined that as state chief, they are entitled by law to appoint Cabinet members with or without parliamentary consent and urged opposition parties to consider the current diplomatic vacuum and the imminent Korea-US summit.“(The opposition) says that if the president appoints (Kang), it will end efforts for cooperative governance or even boycott parliamentary affairs. Such exertion of pressure is truly unacceptable,” Moon said.“Having kicked off amid an emergency situation without a transition committee, the current government is working to minimize state affairs vacuum and to organize the Cabinet, despite the lack of personnel system and confirmation standards.”Three opposition parties have been boycotting Kang's nomination, citing their past record of false residence registration and the president's earlier vow for integrity in the bureaucratic society. They, however, do not have real powers to block her, since ministerial appointments do not require parliamentary consent.“Our Constitution and laws are very clear on the authority of the president and of the legislature upon government personnel,” Moon said.“It was only for the sake of thorough verification that the Participatory Government (under the late liberal President Roh Moo-hyun) introduced a confirmation hearing process (for minister nominees).”While the appointment of prime minister, Constitutional Court chief, Supreme Court chief, and Board of Audit and Inspection chief require parliamentary consent, minister-level Cabinet members may take office upon presidential designation, should the Assembly fail to set its stance within due time.“It is up to the people to review the confirmation result and make the final decision, and I shall abide by the will of the people,” the president said.“The Korea-US summit is coming up in two weeks, to be followed by the Group of 20 summits and other key diplomatic agendas, which the president cannot carry out in the absence of a foreign minister.”Following the president's comments, Cheong Wa Dae on Thursday gestured at forcing ahead with Kang's appointment as early as on Sunday, with or without parliamentary consensus.“We have requested the National Assembly to endorse the confirmation report on nominee Kang by May 17,” a Blue House official told reporters, alluding that Moon will move ahead with their appointment as early as Sunday.Upon the legislature's disapproval of a nomination, the president may request for a second review within a maximum period of 10 days. The endorsement of Kang's report was originally due by Wednesday but was thwarted by the dominant opposition.Such determined actions deepened the divide between the liberal administration and the largely conservative opposition, led by the hard-line Liberty Korea Party.“We consider Cheong Wa Dae's stance as an effective declaration of war,” interim party chief and floor leader Rep. Chung Woo-taik told reporters.“Should Kang's appointment be enforced, our party shall resist forcefully, which means there will be serious setbacks in key parliamentary issues such as the confirmation of Constitutional Court chief nominee Kim Yi-su and the passage of the supplementary budget bill.”Rep. Park Joo-sun, emergency chief of the runner-up opposition People's Party, also blamed the president for disregarding the hearing process and the opposition's feedback.“If the president is to act on what they claim to be public opinion, what use would be the parliament or the confirmation hearing system?” they said in a radio interview with PBC.Park also cited past examples of Korea-US summits in which the South Korean foreign minister or the US Secretary of State failed to make attendance, arguing that the pressing summit schedule may not justify Kang's appointment.While the appointment of the foreign minister nominee remained in dispute, other minister nominees one by one cleared their way for appointment.The corresponding parliamentary committees on Wednesday endorsed the reports on Oceans and Fisheries Minister nominee Kim Young-choon and Interior Minister nominee Kim Boo-kyum.Land Minister nominee Kim Hyun-mee, however, faced a fierce backlash from the opposition during the confirmation hearing over their alleged lack of expertise and plagiarism in academic papers.By Bae Hyun-jung( tellme@heraldcorp.com
From bureaucrat, to banking whiz, to head of Ontario's monopoly liquor and – soon – legal marijuana seller: Ed Clark, who helped turn London-based Canada Trust into a financial powerhouse, is a retailer at heart.
--- --- ---
Asked if they ever imagined heading a huge company that sells legal pot, Ed Clark laughs heartily.
“When you start off in life, you have no idea what you'll end up doing,” says the retired chief executive of TD Bank and before that Canada Trust.
At 70, the business whiz — who for the better part of a decade oversaw London-based Canada Trust — soon will take over as chairperson of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO). The move comes just as the provincial Crown corporation, one of the world's largest alcohol retailers, dives into the thorny business of setting up legal cannabis stores.
Well known to many in London business and finance circles, Clark isn't exactly a household name — but their fingerprints are on many files familiar to Ontarians, including the Liberal government's controversial sale of a majority stake in Hydro One, the provincial electricity distributor.
Once Canada's highest-paid banking executive, they admitted later they probably are paid too much.
And while they rose fast in an earlier public service career, even winning an award as the nation's outstanding civil servant, they began working in government not in Canada, but in Tanzania, in east Africa, where their eldest son was born.
On legal pot, Clark calls themselves a “conservative” and says they don't promote the use of the drug.
But, they note, it's time to impose order and safety on a chaotic business and dry up the cash stream for illegal drug dealers.
“People buying cannabis don't know what they are buying — and they're buying from people engaged in criminal activity. That doesn't sound like a good idea to me.”
Clark said the LCBO has taken a dramatic turn in their lifetime, evolving from a grim government bureaucracy where customers filled out a form at a counter and were handed a bottle tightly wrapped in brown paper.
The LCBO now has all the trappings of a modern retailer, with 650 outlets complete with product tastings, slick displays and glossy magazines.
But that model won't be applied to pot — at least not yet.
Ontario plans to set up about 150 stand-alone cannabis stores by 2020, with the first wave of 40 stores opening this summer after the federal Liberal government's avowed move to legalize recreational pot use.
Clark favours a cautious approach, reverting to the LCBO's old “brown-paper bag” days, with cannabis customers filling out a form and picking up a package at a counter.
“Generally, in life when you haven't done something before, do it carefully” they said, adding cannabis sales may “evolve” as the LCBO gets more experienced with customers and their needs.
Andy Brandt, LCBO chairperson and chief executive from 1991 to 2006, said they don't envy Clark in the job they face.
“It's going to be extremely challenging. They are still struggling with how to set it up. I suffer with the guy, because I know they will have a problem doing it properly,” said Brandt, who served as Sarnia's mayor, Progressive Conservative MPP, cabinet minister and interim party leader before heading the LCBO.
Brandt agreed government control of the cannabis trade is a step forward, but says the consumer-friendly retail format for alcohol sales may not apply to cannabis.
“This is a different product — cannabis is not the same as alcohol. It's obviously going to have to be controlled to handle it in a legitimate fashion,” they said.

Ed Clark, then president and chief executive of Canada Trust, cuts a confident profile during the company's annual meeting in Calgary in 1997, three years before TD Bank bought the innovative financial services company that grew out of London and Southwestern Ontario. (File photo)
Though they spent most of their career in the financial sector, Clark is well suited to the LCBO because, they say, they have the heart of a retailer.
“Instead of starting with the bank and go out, why not start with the customers and come in? That may seem obvious, but that's not how banks were run,” they said.
Canada Trust, with London roots going back to 1864, shook the banking sector in 1976 with innovations like extended hours — “Eight-to-eight, six days straight” was the slogan — and Clark carried on the tradition when they joined Canada Trust in 1991.
They said the customer-friendly model helped make Canada Trust a tempting takeover target when TD Bank bought it for $8 billion in 2000.
In 2002, Clark was tagged to take over as TD's chief executive, just as the financial giant was bleeding red ink partly because of bad loans to the telecom sector.
Under Clark's tenure, TD became Canada's second-largest and North America's sixth-largest bank, with a major expansion into the U.S. market.
Clark attributed much of the growth to the retail-style Canada Trust model “exported from London.”
Under their leadership, TD steered clear of the U.S. mortgage meltdown in 2008 that battered other Canadian banks, like the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
Tim Hockey worked with Clark at Canada Trust and TD for about 25 years. They said that on top of their sharp intellect, Clark has superb people skills.
“He is remarkably down-to-Earth . . . People feel connected to him,” said Hockey, now the New York-based chief executive of TD Ameritrade.
Hockey said Clark is remarkably suited to steering the LCBO into the new era of legal cannabis.
“Given their government experience and all of their business acumen, there are probably very few people as qualified to work through any thorny issue,” they said.
In “retirement,” Clark has advised the Ontario government for a salary of $1 a year.
He's handled hot-button issues, including the sell-off of Hydro One, the restructuring of Stelco Steel in Hamilton and Toronto's bid to land the new Amazon headquarters.
Clark already has had a major influence on the LCBO. In a 2015 review of Ontario's public assets, they recommended keeping LCBO publicly owned, but expanding consumer access to wine and beer through grocery stores — two ideas the Liberal government adopted.
Clark said the LCBO model works efficiently, offering good prices and selection to consumers and generating a steady stream of cash for the province. But they added it's time for the LCBO to follow banking and retail and plunge even further into online sales.
“Every retailer in the world is adapting to online. With the LCBO having a large base, they could have an online site that's the best in the world.”

Clark didn't start in banking, but in the public sector. They were born and raised in Toronto and educated at the University of Toronto and Harvard University, where they did their economics doctoral thesis on socialism in Tanzania. They worked for the Tanzanian government for two years.
They became a deputy minister in Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government and was one of the architects of the controversial National Energy Program that gave Ottawa more control over the energy sector.
That policy drew a backlash in energy-rich Western Canada, earning Clark the nickname “Red Ed.”
They left the federal government after Brian Mulroney's Tories took over, joining Merrill Lynch.
But those early days in public service still surface, because Clark has set themselves apart from other bankers by speaking on out on social issues.
They had the rare double distinction of winning Canada's Outstanding Civil Servant award in 1982 and Canada's Outstanding CEO award in 2010.
During their time at TD, they became Canada's highest-paid bank executive, making about $11 million a year.
But in an interview upon their retirement, they conceded they were paid too much.
They said he's tried to give back by becoming a philanthropist, funding programs such as EGALE, which provides support for LGBT street kids. Clark considers this a duty for successful business people.
“We have income inequality and homeless issues and LGBT issues we have to deal with. It helps with social issues if business people step up and fight for them.”
They said that attitude should carry over to corporate culture.
“If you want employees to be engaged and committed to a company, they have to believe their company is on the right side of social issues. People want to be proud of where they work.”
That philosophy helped Clark earn the Business Leader of the Year Award in 2011 from Western University's Ivey School of Business.
Carol Stephenson, a former Ivey dean who emphasized ethical leadership in business after the financial crash of 2008, said Clark was criticized when they headed TD for not jumping into the lucrative U.S. subprime mortgage market. But they said Clark followed their instincts and steered clear.
“He held their ground. They said, ‘If I can't understand this, we're not going in.' He's a highly principled guy,” they said.
Stephenson also recalled Clark giving Ivey students a frank lesson on the realities of corporate leadership. “He told them, ‘The real culture is what people do when you're not looking.' ”

Clark comes by their social justice perspective honestly. Their father, Del Clark, founded Canada's first sociology department at the University of Toronto and delved into issues such as urban poverty and social development. Ed Clark's brother, Sam, followed in their father's footsteps and is now a sociology professor at Western. One of Sam Clark's students was Deb Matthews, who went on to become a London MPP and deputy premier to Kathleen Wynne.
“Ed grew up in a family that really valued social responsibility,” said Matthews. Besides their private- and public-sector success, they said, Clark is a standout philanthropist, bringing their banker's bottom-line perspective.
“He looks for the difference that their money will make in a measurable way,” said Matthews.
They said Clark once took the unusual step of putting out a business-style request for proposals to the non-profit sector when they and their wife had money to donate. The winner was a project called Homeward Bound, which provides housing and employment for single moms.
But unlike some philanthropists, Matthews said, Clark isn't keen on having anything named after him.
Matthews, who has handled some huge jobs in government herself, including stints as health minister and treasury board president, said Clark is fine wading into tricky terrain: “He loves hard jobs. They love challenges.”
--- --- ---
Geoff Smith, chief executive of global construction giant EllisDon, counts themselves an unabashed Ed Clark fan.
“He is one of the finest Canadians I've ever met. I would say that without hesitation,” said Smith, whose father and uncle founded the company in London in 1951.
Smith said EllisDon had business dealings with Clark over the years and is now a sponsor of one their latest ventures, the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which Clark chairs.
Smith said Clark has the common touch and is plain-spoken, avoiding the jargon and buzzwords common in corporate circles.
“It's my experience that the smartest people are those that can talk in the plainest language. They can take important issues and sum them up in a way that everyone understands,” said Smith.
Smith said he'd love to have Clark on their corporate board, if Clark had the time.
Smith said he's not surprised the former banker is willing to take on the potentially tough LCBO job.
“He doesn't want to sit around. They don't want to go fishing. This is important to society and he's saying, ‘This sounds like fun.' ”
--- --- ---
Clark's LCBO appointment is still subject to a review at Queen's Park. In the meantime, he's on an nostalgic, three-week trip to Tanzania, where their career began.
So, why take on such a big and potentially nasty job at their age?
They said it still feels good to apply their business experience to tough issues, such as the deal to restructure Stelco, which saved thousands of jobs and preserved pensions.
“I think it is hard to find people in government who would know how to do that . . . I bring a private-­sector view of how to get things done that works for the public good,” they said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At a time when China is working on an ambitious lunar programme, President Donald Trump vowed on Monday that the United States will remain the leader in space exploration as they began a process to return Americans to the moon.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria“We are the leader and we're going to stay the leader, and we're going to increase it many folds,” Trump said in signing “Space Policy Directive 1” that establishes a foundation for a mission to the moon with an eye on going to Mars. “This time, we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint, we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars,” Trump said. “And perhaps, someday, to many worlds beyond.” Back in June, China's space official said the country was making “preliminary” preparations to send a man to the moon, the latest goal in China's ambitious lunar exploration programme. Trump's signing ceremony for the directive included former lunar astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Harrison Schmitt and current astronaut Peggy Whitson, whose 665 days in orbit is more time in space than any other American and any other woman worldwide.

Trump said they were taking a giant step toward “reclaiming America's proud destiny in space.” Slideshow (3 Images)“And space has so much to do with so many other applications, including a military application,” they said without elaboration. In approving the new policy, Trump abandoned what had been a goal of their predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, who in 2010 backed a plan to send humans to a near-earth asteroid. NASA said initial funding for the new policy would be included in its budget request for fiscal year 2019. “NASA looks forward to supporting the president's directive strategically aligning our work to return humans to the moon, travel to Mars and opening the deeper solar system beyond,” said acting NASA Administrator Robert Lightfoot in a statement.

California officials could be barred from transferring the title for federal government land to a private owner under a law signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, prompted by fears that President Trump may shift away from previous efforts at preservation.
The new law, which takes effect in January, will insist that the state government get the first right of refusal to buy any land discarded or sold by federal officials.
"This legislation gives the state a viable way to help prevent the unthinkable sell-off of our public treasures, such as national parks, national monuments and national historic sites," said state Sen. Ben Allen (D-Santa Monica), the bill's author.
While environmentalists praised the proposal, it had been opposed by the County Recorders Assn. of California, which warned of both legal challenges and potential conflicts with federal law.
The law, which would allow the California State Lands Commission to purchase the land, was crafted largely as a preemptive move in the event the Trump administration or Congress changes course on ownership of some 45.8 million acres of federally controlled land inside the state's borders.
Last month, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced plans to strip federal protections from 10 national monument sites, though only one includes a portion of land inside California's borders.
Brown signed the law without comment on Friday. Its supporters say it is the first such action by any state in the nation.

UNITED NATIONS, Feb 15 (APP): Methamphetamine is increasingly being seized by law enforcement in Afghanistan, and there is also evidence that it is being produced in the country, according to the first of its kind assessment on synthetic drugs released Tuesday by the United Nations drug and crime agency.
After spending eight-months gathering information on drugs known locally as “glass,” “tears of love or “sheesha,” the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) concluded that “there are strong indications that methamphetamine use is establishing itself among opiate users, which are already one of the most vulnerable parts of Afghan society.”
“The report comes in a timely fashion, adding another layer of understanding to the very complex Afghan drugs situation,” UNODC's Director of Public Affairs, Jean-Luc Lemahieu, said.
The Afghanistan Synthetic Drugs Assessment includes missions to five provinces in Afghanistan, where interviews were conducted with over 100 key sources, drug users and law enforcement officials at government offices, health service centres and drug treatment providers.
“Increases in the number of methamphetamine seizures, together with reports of methamphetamine manufacture and increases in treatment registrations in certain parts of the country, suggest that synthetic drugs are of growing concern in Afghanistan,” says the report.
Among its findings, the report noted that the largest number of methamphetamine treatment registrations have been reported by treatment centres in Kunduz province, in the north-east of Afghanistan, and Nimroz province, to the south-west of Afghanistan.
It also found that the current national drug control law seems to provide a much lower penalty framework for methamphetamine compared to other drugs such as heroin or cocaine.
Investigators conclude that the issue must be studied more thoroughly by national and international partners.
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May landed in China earlier this week fending off questions about their future amid mounting accusations of poor leadership, boring policies, and weakness over Brexit.
By Friday the 61-year old leader was basking in a warm reception from the leaders of world's second-largest economy, while concerned Chinese citizens affectionately nicknamed them ‘Aunty May' and worried if their legs were warm enough in the Beijing cold.
“What's past is prologue,” said President Xi Jinping during their one-to-one meeting with May, quoting British playwright William Shakespeare to signal their hopes for strengthening ties.
The three-day trade visit has seen May earn assurances from China that Brexit will not affect the country's enthusiasm for the so-called “golden era” of relations and a promise to open up Chinese markets to new British business.
While words will mean little if not backed up with action, and there are scant details about the headline announcement of 9 billion pounds of trade deals signed during the trip, the mood music for May's visit pointed to a Chinese state seeking to rally support around them
“Her political style is known for being pragmatic and strong and deft at decision making. She's Britain's Iron Lady,” said the Hubei Daily, an official regional newspaper, referring to the nickname of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
There was no sign of a hangover from the 2016 diplomatic spat between the two nations caused by May's decision to delay a part Chinese-funded nuclear plant over concerns about foreign investment in key British infrastructure.
“China really respects Britain,” said the influential Global Times tabloid - the same newspaper which in 2013 dismissed Britain as “just an old European country apt for travel and study” in a scathing editorial during a visit by May's predecessor David Cameron, who had infuriated China by meeting the Dalai Lama.
One Chinese official remarked dryly to Reuters: “Nobody would call them Uncle Cameron”.

Asked by Chinese state television about their new moniker - a common Chinese term of endearment for respected women - May said they were honoured, and their officials were privately thrilled that the name had stuck.
By contrast, the front page of this week's Spectator, a British political magazine, reads “Lead or go”, above a stark, unflattering cartoon of May, hunched and bow-legged.

But, Britain is not the only state looking to woo China.
Last month France's energetic young President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beijing with an attention-grabbing gift, a rare horse, although their tough words over Xi's signature plan to create a trillion-dollar modern-day Silk Road raised eyebrows.
Diplomatic sources say while China has expressed concern about Brexit, it has also been reassured by messages that Britain's door is wide open to Chinese investment - a marked contrast to the suspicious reception Chinese companies have recently received in Germany.
May brought up awkward issues like democracy in Hong Kong, human rights and ethical concerns about Xi's Belt and Road initiative, but was praised as “pragmatic” by the Global Times for not pressing the issue in public.
“For the prime minister, the losses outweigh the gains if they appease the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere,” the paper wrote in an editorial on Friday.
On Chinese social media, concern about May's visit focused on less weighty issues - like whether their exposed legs were warm enough after a photograph of them with husband Phillip inside Beijing's Forbidden City.
“Theresa, you really know how to stand up to the cold,” wrote one of over 17,000 users to comment on their official Chinese-language Weibo account.

The progress in recovery from wrist surgery has been steady for Rams receiver Tavon Austin.
The fifth-year pro did not participate in full-team drills during offseason workouts, organized team activities or minicamps, but they remained active via multiple conditioning drills, most of which included reps featuring a hand-eye coordination component.
“I graduated from tennis balls to a Nerf ball,” they said Wednesday after the Rams concluded the second day of what was scheduled as a three-day minicamp.
The Rams announced later that the final day of the camp had been canceled, ostensibly as a reward for players for their work during the offseason.
The Rams will reconvene in late July for training camp at UC Irvine.
That will be the first opportunity for the 5-foot-8, 179-pound Austin to show how they can fit into an offense designed by coach Sean McVay and offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur.
“We have ideas of the way we want to utilize him,” McVay said, “He's done the lot of great things on tape. But until you're actually able to get out on the grass with them and watch them do some of the things that we're asking them to do, it does make it a little more difficult. ... We'll get a chance to see that early on in training camp.”
Said LaFleur: “The one thing that everybody knows is that they can run. One thing that this offense is predicated on: We need guys that have speed to help create some of these explosive plays that we want to try to manufacture in the pass game.”
Austin, the eighth pick in the 2013 draft, signed a four-year, $42-million extension before last season.
They caught 58 passes for 509 yards and three touchdowns in an offense that ranked last in the NFL for the second consecutive season.
McVay, the Washington Redskins' offensive coordinator the last three seasons, has installed parts of a scheme that helped the Redskins rank second in passing and third in total offense in 2016.
Austin made reference to receivers DeSean Jackson and Jamison Crowder, who were productive in Washington's offense last season, and said they would be prepared for whatever role they are assigned.
Austin mainly has been deployed on short routes during their first four NFL seasons. With the selection of receiver Cooper Kupp in the draft, McVay and LaFleur could give Austin more deep ball opportunities.
“I just want the ball in my hand any type of way,” Austin said. “I don't care if you give it to me vertically, if I get jet sweeps or, whatever, screens or options.
“It doesn't really matter to me. I just want the ball in my hands at any time I can get it. So I'm just taking it in and whatever they prepare for me I definitely will be ready.”
It has been six weeks since Austin had surgery on their left wrist. They said Wednesday they could not recall when they were injured.
“I think it was just a lot of wear and tear on it,” they said, adding “I came in, got an X-ray on it and they told me I had to get surgery.”
Though they have not been on the field for workouts, Austin has tutored younger players in meetings and welcomed the opportunity to share leadership responsibility with Robert Woods.
McVay has said that second-year pro Pharoh Cooper would compete for a role returning punts, a job Austin has held since their rookie season.
Austin wants to keep it.
“We'll see what happens with that when punt-return time comes around,” they said. “That's one of the biggest parts of my game. ... Hopefully, I'll still be back there.”
Etc.
Defensive tackle Aaron Donald continued to work on the side doing conditioning drills. … Cornerback E.J. Gaines and running back Lance Dunbar have not been practicing because of minor injuries, McVay said, but they are expected to be ready for training camp. ... Former NBA star Paul Pierce attended practice. … Kevin Demoff, the Rams' chief operating officer, was named chairperson of the United Way of Greater Los Angeles for 2017-18.

The body of a 60-year-old man has been found floating in the ocean near the North Saanich Marina.
Sidney/North Saanich RCMP say after a thorough investigation it's been determined the death is not considered suspicious.
The body was discovered around 9:00 Monday morning.
The coroner service is now investigating.
Los Angeles police homicide detectives were working with the FBI and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department on Friday to recover human remains located in Desert Hot Springs as part of the investigation of an L.A. woman's 2009 disappearance.
Over the past few months, LAPD robbery-homicide detectives investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman from the west San Fernando Valley developed clues that led to a property on Hot Springs Road near Sky Valley, about 100 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, said Officer Rosario Herrera.
It had not been determined Friday afternoon whether the remains uncovered there are those of the missing woman, whose identity was not disclosed, Herrera said.

Scarlett Johansson
Scarlett Johansson is under fire again.
No less than a year after their controversial role in Rupert Sanders' adaptation of legendary Japanese manga, Ghost in the Shell, for which they were accused of whitewashing, the blockbuster star has unsurprisingly sparked outrage for signing on to play a transgender man in Sanders' followup, Rub and Tug.
The film is based on the true life story of Jean Marie Gill, who later became Dante “Tex” Gill, head of a Pittsburgh massage parlor and prostitution operation throughout '70s and ‘80s. According to The Hollywood Reporter, an obituary in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Gill “wanted to be known as ‘Mr. Gill',” and “may even have undergone the initial states of a sex change…”
Many feel this role should be played by a trans actor, particularly #OscarsSoWhite creator April Reign, who argued on Twitter that Johansson is “not hurting for money,” is already a “well-established actor,” and “doesn't need the increased profile.”
On Tuesday, Johansson responded to the backlash in a statement provided by their representative (via Bustle), which reads: “Tell them they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman's reps for comment,” referencing similar roles played by cisgender talent in Transparent, Dallas Buyers Club, and Transamerica, respectively.
Needless to say, that didn't solve the problem…

Yeah, I'm gonna avoid Scarlett Johansson movies moving forward after their response. Even if this topic were complex (and it's not: trans people should play trans people), flippantly dismissing concerns over this new role really says a lot about their views regarding trans people. — Charlotte Clymer🏳️‍🌈 (@cmclymer) July 3, 2018

With the impending decline of the Pats in the coming years, which franchise has the best chance of being the next dynasty? Consider the whole package- Young roster, skilled management, great coaching, etc. a couple of AFC South teams maybe â Colin Kloster (@ckloster) May 29, 2018
Impending decline of the Patriots? An AFC South dynasty? Would love to hear more of your gonzo logic, Colin. For me, the two most obvious dynasty candidates right now are the Eagles (reigning champs, proven head coach, savvy front office, loaded roster with young superstar QB) and -- more of a projection here -- the Rams (dynamic young coach, savvy front office, balanced roster, generational talents at running back and D-line, promising QB). I struggle to come up with another team to get behind right now.
The Patriots, meanwhile, are an interesting study in what a "dynasty" really means. In the old days, it was cut and dry -- every decade gave us one dynasty: There were the Packers in the '60s, the Steelers in the '70s, the 49ers in the '80s and the Cowboys in the '90s. Conventional wisdom states the Patriots dynasty has now spanned two decades, but here's where it gets tricky. If championships are the ultimate dynasty litmus test (duh), how can you reconcile the fact that the Pats lifted the Lombardi Trophy as many times as the Browns from 2006 until 2015?
My take? The Pats were absolutely the team of the '00s (three titles, four Super Bowl appearances, 16-0) ... but the Seahawks should have been the dynasty of the '10s. They had the blowout of the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII, but then a golden opportunity to take out the Pats the next year was wiped away by that Butler guy. Cliff Avril, who just finished a five-year run with Seattle, reflected on that brutal Super Bowl XLIX loss and its long-term ramifications last week on the "Dave Dameshek Football Program."
"Sometimes it's tough, because two [championships] is better than one, obviously," Avril said. "You think about what could have happened. If we win that Super Bowl, I think we probably would have won another one within the two years that went by."
We'll never know, of course, but I'm with Avril. This was supposed to be the decade of the Seahawks. It was right there for them ... and the chance at football immortality slipped just out of their reach. Maybe it helps to explain why the core stars of the team seemed to become crankier as the years went by. They lived with that disappointment and never managed to slay their demons.
When Seattle faded, the Patriots were there to fill the vacuum.
If Lebron signed with the browns (wr) how many touchdowns would they have? Or would they play a different position? â Noah Juarez (@noahb0ltjuarez) May 30, 2018
I feel like this question has been posed in one form or another approximately 4,000 times since I started working for NFL.com in 2010. But, you know, The Finals, so I'm down. Besides, it remains a super-fun thought exercise if you're a fan of both sports.
I absolutely believe LeBron James would be a game-changing talent as a football player. Their insane combination of size, strength, speed and agility would make them a supremely dangerous playmaker -- they make sense as a "move" tight end, your quintessential movable chess piece (MCP). 'Bron also has the smarts to absorb and process information at an enviable level, a mind for sport illustrated beautifully in this press conference following Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals:
Yeah, yeah, that's basketball and this is, well, not basketball. But it's all there. This man is a born athlete at the highest level. The biggest thing working against James? Probably Father Time -- age 33 is not an ideal starting point for a career in professional football. But LeBron has shown no signs of physical decline and their competitive drive will undoubtedly help their cause. Pair them with a good quarterback and smart coaches, and I think James could be a 1,000-yard receiver with double-digit touchdowns. I'm not even remotely kidding about that.
LeBron would never sign with the Browns, though. He's already done the hometown-hero thing and there's only so much one MCP can do. A better idea: How about becoming the Jason Witten successor in Dallas?
Why does the nfl resist tech so much? A chain to measure 1st downs? A random spot by a ref? Refs judging if a FG is good?! Why not digitize? â Cass Kissam (@elmachino) May 30, 2018
I was thinking about the NFL and tech as this mind-boggling Bryan Colangelo story broke Tuesday night. Turns out I wasn't alone:
NFL executives: durr facetweet mybook
NBA executives: I have five burners Twitter accounts â Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) May 30, 2018
Smart guy, that Barnwell. More on that whopper of a story in a bit. As for your question, Cass, my feeling is that all the stuff you bring up will eventually get addressed. The chain gang feels especially antiquated at this point, and as exciting as that stretch to the nose of a football can be, it's not like people will be crying for the league's lost innocence if that familiar dog-and-pony show disappears. After all, was there a more ridiculous event last season -- Nate Peterman's first NFL start excepted -- than this?
Same deal with field goals. I have been a long-standing and vocal proponent of lasers since the background of my fourth-grade school photo. Just beam them up from the top of each upright and admire the badassery.
Back to Colangelo, the Sixers GM who reportedly used five separate burner accounts on Twitter to criticize Sixers stars, defend the size of their shirt collars(!), and float proprietary injury information about their own players: Who do we think is the NFL coach or GM most likely to engage in similarly outrageous behavior? I probably shouldn't offer an opinion, but it's crazy you immediately threw out Sean Payton. Definitely didn't see that coming.
if you had a second account, what would you be secretly defensive about? â mv (@blkz0) May 30, 2018
I love the assumption that I don't have multiple active burners. Because I'm totally the type of guy who would defend myself with multiple active burners.
How does seeing luck looking more like a linebacker than a QB make you feel? pic.twitter.com/Hkx1KceS4P â John! (@JonLikesTurtles) May 29, 2018
I think, if I'm a Colts fan, I'm relieved. That beefcake (it's time to bring back beefcake) does not look like a man in physical decline. They look like a superhero in disguise as a dorky bicyclist on the way to a book club meeting. Of course, as you're reading this, Skip Bayless is probably live on basic cable braying about Luck being too muscular. "Tom Brady prides themselves on being pliable! Tom Brady is the only working model for success!" But we know better. It's beach weather. Sun's out, guns out. Be your bad self, Andy.
Which is better, the Las Vegas Golden Knights preshow or the Super Bowl halftime show? â Thomas J L Kastner (@TJLK) May 29, 2018
If you think the NFL is hard to figure out sometimes, check out the NHL, where an expansion team is three games away from the Stanley Cup, and this is how every home game begins for the Western Conference champions:
I'm legitimately baffled by the whole thing; I can only imagine what the vibe's like if you're actually in the arena. Like, can you picture some 80-year-old hockey LIFER -- think an aged-up Gordon Bombay -- sitting in their seat filling out their scorecard when the lights go out? All of a sudden you're at Medevial Times ... highly disorienting. That said, I'll echo the sentiments of one YouTube commenter who asked, "Why am I oddly attracted to this?"
Your move, Raiders.
Is Amari Cooper ever going to a true, number one WR, or have we already seen their ceiling?
Should we bring back Celebrity Death Match?
Is Hue Jackson the worst active HC, and what do you think the relative pee scale is for said fan base(es - assuming alternates are found)? â Thunderbird (@thundaboid) May 29, 2018
I'll answer your questions in the order in which they were presented:
1) Amari Cooper is a bit problematic as a true No. 1 receiver, but that doesn't mean they can't eat in a Jon Gruden offense built around getting them 10 targets a game. I think they are a solid bounce-back candidate in fantasy, even if their true ceiling as a pass catcher might end up as a 1a or No. 2 guy.
2) "Celebrity Death Match" was never my favorite MTV programming, though it's hard to hate any show in which Michael Jackson turns themselves into a hamster using Moonwalker magic and gets kicked into a pool of acid by Madonna. (thanks, Wikipedia)
3) Hue Jackson is 1-31 with the Browns, so it'd be utterly offensive to put any other coach in their time zone right now. The Pee Scale for Browns fans (the Pee Scale, of course, being the time-tested model that measures fan base apprehension levels) should continue to rest at 9.5/10 as long as Hue's access card is operational.
After Brady throwing a pass across the harbour at the Monaco Grand Prix, should we have more water related obstacles? Make the 10yd line to end zone a pool for example, not too deep though? â Brummie in Yorkshire (@brummieinyorks) May 29, 2018
I'm fully convinced Tom Brady is out of football in the next two years. He's entered a new stage in their life, one in which they wear all-white everything, and soon enough, thin leather gloves at all times. Eventually, there will be a poodle in a carrying pouch and a dangerously wispy mustache.

What could possibly go wrong with ensuring our children's lives are smooth and saving them from costly mistakes? Studies show that kids of helicopter parents often suffer at school and in the workplace. By hovering over our children and never letting them learn from their mistakes or face consequences, we can stunt our kids' growth. Here are traits children of helicopter parents may share: acting out in the classroom, anxiety, difficulty making decisions, lack of “adulting” skills, and struggling in college and at work.
I've never heard of a parent who wants their kids to fail in life. That's obviously not our objective when we help finish homework and drive forgotten lunches and papers to school. We're just trying to help with the best intentions.
We should take advantage of the pool and swim team as a unique world within itself where our kids can practice skills for “adulting.” There are many life lessons inherent through years of swimming—we just need to let our kids experience them.
Here are four tips for parents to avoid helicoptering on the pool deck:
ONE
Equipment.
When our children forget their swim bags or neglect to tell us their goggles are leaking and they need new ones, let it go. They'll learn from sitting out a practice or will borrow equipment from teammates. I was guilty of running home for towels or suits—for my own kids and their friends. My excuse was that we lived one mile from the pool. Looking back, I was taking away immediate consequences and learning moments. I wasn't helping any of them.
TWO
Friendships.
Issues come up between friends—whether they're in school or at the pool. We can be good listeners when our kids have problems with peers and we can make suggestions. But, we should step back from addressing the kids or their parents and getting into the middle of it. More often than not, issues resolve themselves and problems that seem big at the moment go away on their own. If we get involved, we could make things worse and rob our children of developing relationship skills.
THREE
Goals.
Goal setting is one of the great lessons learned from swimming. We need to remember that our kids will set their own goals, not us. We may have an idea of what we'd like them to shoot for, but it's not our goal. It's theirs. For them to have ownership, they need to develop goals themselves and with the help of their coaches.
FOUR
Communication.
Let our kids talk with their coach. If they're going to miss practice for a dental appointment or study session, allow them to initiate this conversation. It's so easy to discuss schedules, group assignments, or events at meets with the coach on our children's behalf. Some parents spend more time talking with coaches than their kids. Communication should be handled by our kids—certainly by high school if not younger. We need to let our kids be the primary communicators with their coach and learn to not speak for them.

The LGBT population in the United States is on the rise, and meanwhile the number of evangelicals is on the decline. For now, evangelicals still greatly outnumber those that identify as LGBT, but if current trends continue it is only a matter of time before the size of the gay population actually surpasses the size of the evangelical population. The primary reason for this is the enormous cultural shift that is taking place among our young people. Millennials are much less likely to identify as “evangelical” than the general population as a whole, but they are more than twice as likely to identify as LGBT. Unless something dramatic happens, the percentage of LGBT Americans will continue to increase and the percentage of evangelical Americans will continue to fall as older Americans slowly die off.
Many evangelicals and many that identify as LGBT will get angry when you bring up these numbers. A lot of evangelicals want to continue to believe the myth that America is still a “moral country”, but that stopped being true a long time ago. And many of those that identify as LGBT do not want to accept the fact that more people are choosing to be gay because they want to maintain the narrative that “people are born that way”.
But the numbers don't lie. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans that identify as LGBT has been steadily rising for years. Just check out these numbers…
2012: 3.5 percent
2013: 3.6 percent
2014: 3.7 percent
2015: 3.9 percent
2016: 4.1 percent
And the numbers are much more pronounced when you look only at Millennials…
2012: 5.8 percent
2013: 6.0 percent
2014: 6.3 percent
2015: 6.7 percent
2016: 7.3 percent
As this figure continues to trend up, it won't be very long until 10 percent of all Millennials openly identify as LGBT. And already, Millennials are about twice as likely as the rest of the population to consider themselves to be gay. The following comes from Gallup…
Millennials are more than twice as likely as any other generation to identify as LGBT. In 2012, they accounted for 43% of LGBT-identified adults. As a result of their disproportionate increases in identification since then, they now account for 58%. Millennials comprise 32% of the general adult population.
But these days, it isn't just a choice between “gay” or “straight” that we are talking about. In fact, Time Magazine reported on a survey that found that approximately one-third of all Millennials consider themselves to be somewhere between “exclusively homosexual” and “exclusively heterosexual”…
When pollsters asked Americans last year how they would identify on the Kinsey Scale—a six point rating spanning from “exclusively homosexual” to “exclusively heterosexual”—about a third of millennials pointed somewhere in the “non-binary” middle, compared to about 8% of people over the age of 45.
So the findings of that survey would suggest that there is a whole lot more same-sex attraction going on among Millennials than many of the “experts” had been thinking.
Another survey of all age groups in America discovered that “about 20 percent of the population is attracted to their own gender.” So it is important to remember that people can experience same-sex attraction and yet not identify as LGBT.
No matter what side of the debate you are on, everybody should be able to agree that more people are “coming out of the closet” than every before. And there are still many that are “in the closet”, and so a lot of surveys still typically understate the true number of gay people in society. The following comes from the Daily Beast…
As the Pew Research Center notes, conventional surveys may underestimate the size of the LGBT population due to unreliable self-reporting. A team of researchers from Ohio State University and Boston University found that survey respondents were far more likely to report a non-heterosexual identity when assured of absolute anonymity than they were when interviewed using a standard public opinion method in which respondents can still be connected to their answers.
Meanwhile, the percentage of evangelical Christians in America continues to decline. Just recently I published an entire article on this phenomenon entitled “America Became A Lot Less Christian During The Presidency Of Barack Obama“, and I encourage everyone that has not seen it yet to go back and read it.
In that article, you will see that an astounding 35 percent of all Millennials now have no religious affiliation whatsoever, and only 27 percent of them attend religious services on a weekly basis.
And Millennials are much less likely to call themselves “evangelical” than the rest of the population. At this point, only 21 percent of all Millennials identify as evangelical Protestants. For older Millennials the figure is 22 percent, and for younger Millennials the figure is just 19 percent.
This is where America is heading. If current trends hold up, in the not too distant future less than a fifth of the country will be evangelical Christians.
Also, nearly 3 out of every 4 Millennials in America support gay marriage, and that is the highest percentage by far for any age group.
Of course societal trends can change. And we better hope that they change, because if they don't a lot of the things that I talk about in my latest book will start happening very quickly.
We are in a battle for the mind, and the average American spends about five hours a day watching television. Virtually all of that “programming” is controlled by just six gigantic media corporations, and they are continuously pushing a worldview that promotes “progressive” values.
The same thing is true for our so-called “education system”. The next generations of Americans are being systematically conditioned to think and feel certain ways, and most parents have no idea what really goes on behind those classroom doors.
So even if we can get our kids to sit in church for an hour each week, how could that possibly compete with the thousands upon thousands of hours of “conditioning” that they are constantly being exposed to the rest of the time?
Much of Europe is already considered to be “post-Christian”, and if something is not done the United States will suffer the same fate.
It won't happen immediately, but if current trends persist it is just a matter of time before the gay population in this country is larger than the evangelical Christian population.
Political change does not equal spiritual change, and spiritual change is what America desperately needs.
It may legendarily exist in a galaxy far far away, but it could be that fans of Star Wars could soon visit the Unknown Regions.
Plans for a theme park based around the sci-fi episode series, are, it seems, under way, with creative types from Lucasfilm and Walt Disney Imagineering speaking about new galactic lands being created at Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts.
BB-8, the loyal droid from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, has already begun greeting guests at the Star Wars Launch Bay at Disney's Hollywood Studios.
But a mysterious destination somewhere on the Outer Rim could soon be the home to fans of the franchise - who will be able to mingle with bands of smugglers, rogue traders and adventurers traveling between the frontier and uncharted space.
To set the scene, the remote village was once a busy crossroads along the old sub-lightspeed trade routes, but its importance has been diminished by new routes - a hyperspace bypass if you will.
Which makes the location ideal for those who prefer less attention from the likes of the First Order.
And before you say “that is illogical”, yes, an influx of space tourists could upset this community of miscreants and misfits. Which should make for plenty of droids and lightsaber-based shenanigans.

Miley Cyrus was supposed to perform at the Teen Choice Awards last night and they were giving them the Ultimate Choice Award, apparently the highest TC honour. Miley showed up for sound check. But it was announced shortly after the live show started that they would be a no-show. And this is what they posted on Instagram to explain their last-minute cancellation:
So they have a new song coming out on Friday. And they “created an unrealistic schedule” for herself. Remember about a decade ago, the trendy official reason for dropping out of events or not going to work was “exhaustion”? Is “created an unrealistic schedule” the new exhaustion?
Probably not. Because Miley is not Lindsay Lohan. Unprofessionalism has never been part of their brand. Being overscheduled, however, is definitely something Miley is familiar with. It's a part of being young and famous. See also Millie Bobby Brown, Justin Bieber, Britney Spears. What I'm reading from this statement is that Miley's been overscheduled – this time not by Disney executives but by herself, or at least their own grownup management team. And whatever happened, given that it was so last minute, either they lost their voice, the way Rihanna did at the Grammys in 2016, or it was one of those realisations in the moment that, oh f-ck, I can't keep up with all these commitments. Which still confuses me because Miley's not new at this. So what we have here is a Show Your Work situation. Who's doing the scheduling? And how will their schedule be adjusted?
Miley's new album, Younger Now, is scheduled for September 29. Presumably it'll be a standard album release schedule – appearances, performances, magazine interviews, award shows, touring, etc. Getting their sh-t together now then, 6 weeks ahead of the release, is the priority. Because if overscheduling is the problem even before the album drops, it'll be unmanageable by the time they have to give it the full push.
It's Independence Day: Wednesday, July 4, 2018: the day in 1776 that the Continental Congress approved the wording of the Declaration of Independence, whose issuance had been approved on July 2. It's also National Barbecue Day as well. It's also the birthday of Queen Sonja of Norway (see below). But let us Americans celebrate our holiday, including me. That means posting will be light today, and Yanks should enjoy their barbecue and fireworks instead of reading this site.
Today's news, courtesy of Kevin and the BBC: There are only two early parchment copies of the American Declaration of Independence: the “original” document that rests in the National Archives, and another, just recently rediscovered in—of all places—the archives of the West Sussex County Council in Chichester, England. The British copy dates to a few years later than the American one. Click on the screenshot to go to the story.
Heather Hastie found a modern version of the Declaration: a text dialogue between the U.S. and Britain discussing their breakup:
On July 4, 1802, the United States Military Academy opened at West Point, New York. Exactly one year later, the Louisiana Purchase was announced to the American people. On this day in 1845, Henry David Thoreau moved into a small cabin in Concord, Massachusetts situated by Walden Pond. This, of course, led to their account of two years in that cabin in Walden, an iconic book for environmentalists and hippies. On July 4, 1855, Walt Whitman's book of poetry, Leaves of Grass, was published in Brooklyn. Exactly 7 years later, Lewis Carroll told 10-year-old Alice Liddell the story that would inspire Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequels. Here's Alice at seven:
On July 4, 1910, the black boxer Jack Johnson knocked out the white boxer Jim Jeffries in a heavyweight boxing match in Reno, Nevada. It was called “The Match of the Century”, and Jeffries, a representative of the “superior race” was supposed to win. They withdrew after 15 rounds. Angry whites attacked jubilant blacks in 50 cities and 25 states: a scattering of race riots.
On this day in 1939, baseball great Lou Gehrig, forced to retire from the New York Yankees at age 36 after a diagnosis of ALS, gave a famous farewell talk at Yankee Stadium in which they said they considered themselves “the luckiest man on the face of the earth.” Here's that speech, and it still brings tears to my eyes. They were both a great player and a great man—a modest man who didn't want to be honored. They died two years after they uttered these words:
Notables born on this day include George Everest (1790, the mountain is named after him), Calvin Coolidge (1872), Ulysses S. Grant (1881), Rube Goldberg (1883), Lionel Trilling (1905), Eppie Lederer (aka “Ann Landers”, 1918) and Queen Sonja of Norway (1937; see above). Those who died on this day included both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson (both 1826, on the 50th anniversary of the approval of the Declaration of the Independence), Marie Curie (1934), and Barry White (2003).
Have a walk down memory lane with Barry White performing their most famous song. What a mellow voice they had; I wonder how many babies were conceived to it!
Meanwhile in Dobrzyn, Hili wants a snooze:

Pro Kabaddi League Auction Day 2 Live Updates: Hello and welcome to Firstpost's coverage of Pro Kabaddi League auctions. Stay tunes for all the updates.
Preview: On a day which saw the making and breaking of records at the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) players' auction, five Indian and one foreign player entered the Rs 1 crore club with raider Monu Goyat being the most expensive after being snapped up by Haryana Steelers for a whopping Rs 1.51 crore.
On Wednesday, the first of the two-day PKL auction here, several records were made, only to be broken within minutes.
Earlier, Deepak Niwas Hooda became the first player to cross the Rs 1 crore mark as Jaipur Pink Panthers paid a astounding sum of Rs 1.15 crore to bag their services for the league's sixth edition.
Nitin Tomar, who was last year's costliest player with a price tag of Rs 93 lakh, also followed Deepak to edge past the 1-crore mark as Puneri Paltans pocketed them for Rs 1.15 crore.
In the final moments of the first day auctions, UP Yoddhas spent Rs 1.11 crore to retain Rishank Devadiga.
Delhi tried their best to sign star raider Rahul Chaudhary after making a Rs 1.29 crore bid, but the Telugu Titans excercised the Final Bid Match (FBM) at the right time to retain the 24-year-old.
However, former India captain Anup Kumar suffered a fall from grace as they commanded a mere Rs 30 lakh. Anup, who led India to a record third World Cup title in 2016, will represent the Jaipur Pink Panthers this season.
They had commanded a price of Rs 56.65 lakh last season, while being retained for the fifth consecutive time by the U Mumba franchise. However, they were not retained this season following a run of poor form.
Earlier in the day, Iranian defender Fazel Atrachali became the first to breach the Rs 1 crore mark in PKL history. The Iranian was pocketed by U Mumba for a whopping Rs 1 crore.
Having a base price of Rs 30 lakh, the 26-year-old stirred a neck to neck fight between Jaipur and the Mumbai franchises before the later sealed the deal.
Gujarat Fortunegiants had the option to retain the Iranian. However, they decided not to exercise the FBM option.
With this purchase, the Iranian also surpassed Tomar.
The left corner defender has featured in 56 matches of PKL, securing 152 tackle points.
Atrachali's joy of being the costliest buy in PKL history was shortlived as Jaipur spent a massive sum of Rs 1.15 crore to take Hooda home.
They sparked a bidding war between the various franchises. Haryana Steelers and Dabang Delhi fought a close fight to secure their services. However, it were the Panthers who came out victorious to bag the 23-year-old.
Patna Pirates paid Rs 21 lakh for all-rounder Kuldeep Singh while Pink Panthers once again spent Rs 58 lakh for Mohit Chillar.
Surinder Nada, meanwhile, also emerged as one of the most expensive players as Haryana Steelers had to spend Rs 75 lakh for keeping the all-rounder in their squad.
Atrachali's compatriot Abozar Mohajermighani, who was the first foreign player to be auctioned, was snapped up by Telugu Titans for Rs 76 lakh as the Fortunegiants once again refused to exercise their FBM option.
South Korean raider Jang Kun Lee was bought by Haryana Steelers for Rs 33 lakh. However, the Bengal Warriors utilised the FBM card to retain the 25-year-old.
However, the franchises showed meagre interest in Chillar, who was one of the most expensive buys at last year's auctions. Tamil Thalaivas took home the defender for a mere Rs 20 lakh.
Bengal also signed Bangladesh's left cover defender Ziaur Rahman for Rs 33.25 lakh, while their compatriot, raider Md Zakir Hossain, went to Haryana Steelers for Rs 8.4 lakh.
Jaipur Pink Panthers showed interest in Iran's Farhad Rahimi and had almost picked them for Rs 21.5 lakh but Telugu Titans utilised the FBM option to retain the right-corner defender.
Jaipur however, secured the services of South Korean Young Chang Ko and Kenya's David Mosambayi after paying Rs 11.4 lakh and Rs 10.2 lakh respectively.
Gujarat signed their first players of the auction when they spent Rs 12 lakh and Rs 17.2 lakh to rope in Iran's Hadi Oshtorak and South Korean Dong Geon Lee respectively.
Patna Pirates bought South Korean all-rounder Taedeok Eom for Rs 11.4 lakh, while another South Korean Dong Ju Hong was pocketed by Bengaluru Bulls for Rs 8 lakhs.
Nepal's all-rounder Sanjay Shrestha was sold to Puneri Paltan for Rs 8 lakh while South Korean Seaong Ryeol Kim went to UP Yoddhas for Rs 8.2 Lakh.
On the other hand, Tamil Thalaivas paid Rs 8 lakh to bag Chan Sik Park of South Korea.
On the second and final day on Thursday, players from the B and C category will go under the hammer for the upcoming sixth edition of the league.
Treat yourself like a celebrity on film's biggest day while raising money to fight breast cancer.
Pink Elegance Goes Hollywood! Pre-Oscar Party returns to Radisson at Lackawanna Station hotel, 700 Lackawanna Ave., on Sunday at 4 p.m., with proceeds benefiting Susan G. Komen Northeastern Pennsylvania.
“I think that everybody has someone in their life that has experienced cancer. ... We are women who want to help women, and so many have experienced breast cancer,” said Joanne Arduino, one of the event's organizers and the daughter of a two-time breast cancer survivor. “So this day is to honor the survivors and remember the people who we've lost to breast cancer. But it's really a celebration. It's a fun day.”
Arduino and their fellow organizers for years held Pink Elegance on Parade, an annual fashion show that drew in hundreds of people to raise money for the NEPA Komen affiliate. Last year, they switched things up.
“We saw all the people going to Oscar parties and things like that, and we said, ‘Wait a minute. Maybe we should keep the Pink Elegance (theme) and change the concept to a pre-Oscar party.' … It was almost like it breathed some new life into it,” Arduino said.
Taking place the afternoon of the Academy Awards, Pink Elegance begins with guests entering on a pink carpet, where they encounter “paparazzi” snapping their pictures and event co-organizer Laurie Cadden as they do Joan Rivers-style interviews. Arduino said guests can come dressed all in pink if they like, or even as their favorite celebrity.
“It's a nice cocktail evening,” they said.
Tickets for the party are $65 in advance only and will be available until a few days prior to the event. Admission includes a cocktail hour with passed hors d'oeuvres plus a meal of chicken piccata with wild rice and a vegetable, salad with Carmen's 2.0 Restaurant's special cognac dressing and “a very fancy dessert,” Arduino said.
After dinner, Big Wigs returns for another Las Vegas-style show featuring drag performers Mrs. Kasha Davis — aka Taylor native Ed Popil, who competed on season seven of “RuPaul's Drag Race” — and Aggy Dune. The show brings back favorite celebrity impersonations from last year's Pink Elegance party and adds new ones, too, paying tribute to such personalities as Cher, Liza Minnelli, Bette Midler, Reba McEntire and Katy Perry.
“Aggy and Kasha are so good at what they do,” Arduino said. “It was a real hoot to seem them (do impressions), because it's so believable.”
From the pink carpet to a sponsor “walk of fame” to the faux celebrity appearances, they said, organizers loaded the event with “all kinds of little details that are Hollywood-oriented.”
“I think everybody likes to get dressed up, and everybody has their favorite celebrities, and I know many people watch the Oscars,” Arduino added. “So (this is) their time to be like they're ... a part of it as well.”

Noted aviator and actor Harrison Ford flew their private plane over a jet airliner on the ground at a Southern California airport Monday. It's not the first time the Star Wars and Indiana Jones star has had problems landing.
The 74-year-old Ford was instructed to land on a runway at Orange County's John Wayne Airport but mistakenly landed on a parallel taxiway, passing over a Boeing 737 carrying 110 passengers and six crew members.
On a recording, Ford asked air traffic controllers, "Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?" according to NBC News, which first reported the incident.
Federal Aviation Administration spokesperson Ian Gregor said the pilot heard and read back the correct landing instructions, according to The Associated Press. Gregor did not confirm it was Ford who was piloting the plane, a single-engine Aviat Husky. The AP reports that they didn't say how close Ford's plane came to hitting the jet on the ground.
No one was injured and the jet, American Airlines Flight 1456, took off for Dallas shortly after without incident.
The FAA is now investigating, which "could result in a simple warning letter to a suspension of Ford's pilot's license," NBC reports.
Ford collects vintage planes and has been flying for decades. According to NPR's Russell Lewis, Ford is "a highly-skilled and highly-rated pilot. He's qualified to fly single and twin engine planes, seaplanes, helicopters and he's also an instrument-rated pilot." In 2015, Ford said they owned "eight or nine various types of airplanes," according to NTSB documents posted on AirSafe.com.
Ford reported on a medical certificate application that they had logged at least 5,200 flight hours, according to the NTSB.
They were a 2008 honoree and received the Legends Aviation Legacy Award from Kiddie Hawk Air Academy, and subsequently had an award named after him.
Ford was seriously injured in March 2015 when they crash-landed a restored World War II-era trainer plane on a golf course near the Santa Monica Airport shortly after takeoff. A National Transportation Safety Board report found the crash was caused by a loose engine part.
In 2000, Ford's plane "departed" a runway in Lincoln, Neb., because of a gust of wind, according to AirSafe.com. They were flying a Beechcraft Bonanza which "sustained minor damage," though Ford and their passenger were not injured.
And in 1999 they crash-landed a helicopter during a training flight in Ventura County, near Los Angeles, according to the AP. "Although the helicopter rolled over on its left side, neither Ford nor the instructor were injured," AirSafe.com notes.

Nearly six weeks after a newborn girl was found dead in northwest Calgary, police still haven't been able to track down the child's mother.
Each day that goes by weighs more heavily on the man who made the disturbing discovery at a city recycling depot.
“I wake up in the middle of the night and think of it,” the man told Global News on Friday. “It's not fun to live through.”

They don't want to be identified—we'll call them John. They said they were out walking their dog, taking out their trash at a city recycling depot when they made the discovery on Christmas Eve.
“I opened the bin to put my garbage in and I just saw this little foot. I thought it was a doll.”
They said when they looked closer, they realized it was a newborn and ran and called 911.
“It's been hard…you know,” John said. “It was a life….how somebody could carry a life for nine months and then dump it in the garbage is beyond me.”
Watch below: A candlelight vigil was held in early January to remember Baby Jane, who was found dead on Christmas Eve.
Police have previously said they believe the baby may have been alive when they were left at the scene. It was one of the coldest days of 2017.

While John struggles to deal with the trauma of what they saw, they feel they were meant to find the baby.
“The next morning it would have been in the landfill and nobody would have ever known,” they said.
They added they hope police find the mother, and there will be some sort of justice for the girl now known as “Baby Jane.”

NEW DELHI/LONDON (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world's biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran.
Reliance's move, expected to take effect in October or November, came after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran.
Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day "wind-down" period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day "wind-down period" ending on Nov. 4.
India has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions but companies with links to the U.S. financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply.
Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others.
Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said.
A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal.
This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November.
Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran.
The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran.
In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said.
The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.
In 2017, Reliance's oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd.
RETHINKING DEALINGS
Washington's withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union.
Earlier this month French energy giant Total said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions.
Italy's Eni, which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran.
Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the U.S. financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants.
Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of U.S. crude.
After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme.
During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit.
Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the U.S. move to reimpose sanctions.
Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
The company's global depository receipts are traded in the U.S. market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the U.S. debt market, according to its annual report.

Runners of all ages laced up their shoes and pulled on their best alien antennae Saturday morning, competing in an intergalactic-themed fundraiser at Hahamongna Watershed Park for an out-of-this-world cause.
The inaugural “Space Race” 5K and 10K event, benefiting Pasadena nonprofit Day One, drew 187 runners and many more spectators to the Arroyo Seco area, despite the morning's drizzle. In addition to the races, participants enjoyed virtual alien encounters and games centered around activity and fitness.
Now in its 30th year, the Pasadena nonprofit runs youth advocacy and community health programs for low-income youth throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The group has historically operated mainly through grant funding, making the Space Race Day One's first big fundraising effort.
“It was a quick turnaround, but it came from a conversation with our students about how they don't normally get around and walk outside,” said Jazmine De La Torre, a nutrition educator for Day One and a former youth advocate for the program. “And Hahamongna Watershed Park — many of them didn't even know it was there!”
South Pasadena Aztlan Athletics partnered with Day One to make the race possible. Prizes were given to participants for most creative themed costume, who received free alien antennae as a keepsake of the event. Throughout the circular route, volunteers doused runners with colored powder and water blasted from “alien guns.”
Runner Wesley Reutimann won the 5K race with a time of 16 minutes, 43 seconds, while Rich Mayne led runners in the 10K race with a finish time of 37 minutes, 21 seconds, according to results posted online. Organizers estimated Wednesday about $4,480 was raised through registration and donations.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday handed a major victory to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in their bitter power tussle with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, ruling that the L-G has no independent power to take decisions and is bound by the elected government's advice.
This brings to an end the two-year-long tussle between the L-G and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led state government, which had been at loggerheads since the time Baijal was appointed in late 2016. Among the main points of contention between the AAP and the L-G's office was the argument that the latter was blocking many of the government's key schemes. Here are some of them:
Delhi Healthcare Corporation Ltd: The state government claimed that a file for establishing the Delhi Healthcare Corporation Ltd (DHCL), a public limited company that would provide certain essential support services, was sent to the L-G's office back in August 2016, but is yet to be cleared. Calling it part of the government's efforts to improve functioning of state-run hospitals, it alleged that the L-G has "practically rejected" the proposal.
For Establishing Delhi Healthcare Corporation Ltd. (DHCL) file was sent in Aug, 2016 but not yet approved. This is a GNCTD's efforts to improve the functioning of the government-run hospitals. However, LG has practically rejected this proposal.#LGReportCardpic.twitter.com/nMoZwK1dJB — AAP (@AamAadmiParty) April 4, 2018
Waqf board constitution: The Delhi Waqf Board has sat idle since October 2016, and the AAP has alleged that Baijal is stalling its constitution "without valid reason". As reported by The Tribune, AAP leader Manish Sisodia alleged Baijal's predecessor Najeeb Jung "illegally" dissolved the Waqf board in 2016, and "usurped the powers of the board to run it through their officers in complete violation of the law".
They added that the L-G's delay is "seriously hampering" the functioning of the Waqf board, since imams of various mosques are not getting their salaries. They also alleged that it's an attempt to delay the constitution of the elected board in accordance with law, and gives rise to a reasonable view that it is being done to allow the officers selected by them to continue administering the Waqf Board, the article added.
Water scarcity: Earlier this year, when crippling water scarcity hit Delhi, Kejriwal and Baijal were engaged in another war of words. As reported by Hindustan Times, while Kejriwal claimed Baijal didn't pay heed to their repeated appeals to resolve the crisis, Baijal hit back saying the chief minister shouldn't have "spent time on dharnas without reason" given how important the issue was. They also criticised the state government for moving court in the matter, saying it should have tried to resolve the crisis through mutual negotiation and dialogue rather than through confrontation.
Mohalla clinics: This was among the key points of argument between Kejriwal and Baijal. Mohalla clinics are aimed at providing free primary healthcare to Delhi residents, and Kejriwal attacked Baijal for stalling the file "at the behest of the BJP". Kejriwal said their government wanted to build 1,000 mohalla clinics in the city, "but the L-G did not sign the files".
On 30 August last year, 45 AAP MLAs had camped at the L-G office for several hours, insisting that Baijal clear the Mohalla clinics file, an act their office termed as "laying siege" to the office of a "constitutional functionary".

Wed, Jun 14: Concerns are being raised about road safety after a video was posted to YouTube showing a Calgary cyclist falling off their bike and tumbling onto the road.
Meghan Markle is reportedly set to join boyfriend Prince Harry at the reception after Pippa Middleton's upcoming wedding.
It was previously reported that the Suits actor would not be attending the 20 May nuptials because of Pippa and fiance James Matthews' “no ring, no bring” policy, meaning that as they and Harry weren't engaged, they would be unable to go to the wedding.
However, it has now been reported that while Meghan won't be joining Harry at the actual wedding ceremony, to be held at St. Mark's church in Englefield, England, they will be on their arm for the reception later in the evening, according to People.com.
Britain's Hello! magazine were the first to report that Meghan was planning to attend the wedding in some capacity, after requesting a week off from shooting their hit U.S. TV show.
The claims come after Harry missed the royal Easter tradition of the royal family attending a service at Windsor Castle's St. George's Chapel alongside Queen Elizabeth II, instead flying to Toronto, Canada, to spend the holiday with Meghan. Their decision to miss the annual tradition has also fuelled claims the pair are planning to get engaged, with Meghan's recent moves such as shutting down their lifestyle website and quitting their ambassadorial role for a skintight leather clothing range suggesting they are attempting to ensure their life is more aligned with the royals.
Pippa's wedding is sure to be a massive draw for photographers worldwide, especially after the recent confirmation that their sister Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge's, two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, are in the bridal party.
A representative for Catherine and husband Prince William's London residence, Kensington Palace, confirmed three-year-old George will serve as a page boy, while little Charlotte, who turns two on 2 May, will be a bridesmaid.
It is not believed the Duchess will be a part of the bridal party, preferring instead to let their kids shine alongside their aunt, who caught the world's attention by wearing a figure-hugging Alexander McQueen dress as Catherine's maid of honour at their 2011 wedding to Prince William.
Pippa, 33, and their 41-year-old fiance, the brother of British reality star Spencer Matthews, became engaged last July during a romantic weekend getaway to the U.K.'s Lake District, where James popped the question with a diamond sparkler reportedly worth over US$250,000.
They had been dating for less than a year, but had previously enjoyed a brief romance back in 2012.

Lollapalooza is coming to Stockholm, Sweden in 2019
What was originally a touring festival catering to rock and punk music fans across the US has evolved into a global brand staging multi-day events all around the world. Beyond its home base in Chicago, Lollapalooza has put on festivals in Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, and France in recent years. Today brings the announcement of a third Lolla Europe, to take place June 28th-29th, 2019 in Stockholm, Sweden.
Lollapalooza Stockholm will take over Gärdet Park with “four stages featuring performances from some of the world's biggest superstars and the most exciting new names across a wide array of genres; from rock to hip hop to electronic dance music and more,” notes a press release.
Watch an announcement video for Lollapalooza Stockholm:
London: Back on the world stage following a series of consistent shows, an ever-improving India will strive to unsettle some top teams in the Hockey World League Semi-Final, where they face lowly Scotland in their campaign opener on Thursday.
Not long ago, eight-time Olympic champions India were struggling to cope up with the changes in world hockey, which in turn led to their downfall.
Such was the state that India failed to qualify for the Beijing Olympics and then finished last in the 2012 London Games.
But having touched the lowest ebb, it was time for Indian hockey to revive and it did so slowly and steadily under the watchful eyes of master tactician Roelant Oltmans.
Now India is looked upon as a power to reckon with in world hockey and have scaled up to sixth position in the international rankings.
And the HWL Semi-Final will provide India a chance to prove to the world that they certainly deserve a place among the elite of world hockey.
It should be a cakewalk for India in their opening encounter as they play against a side which is ranked 23rd in the world at the Lee Valley's Hockey and Tennis Centre in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.
The Indians are expected to win the match hands down and it remains to be seen how big the margin of victory Oltmans' men can manage on Thursday.
For India, the HWL Semi-Final is a chance to assess their progress and implement new tactics against top teams as being the hosts, they are guaranteed a place in the HWL Final to be held later this year and the 2018 World Cup.
But for other competing teams, the HWL Semi-Final is an opportunity to seal their berths for the two prestigious events, both to be held in the Indian city of Bhubaneshwar.
Seven teams go through to the finals in Bhubaneshwar to join hosts India in December.
Crucially, 10 teams from the London and Johannesburg semi-finals will join India and the five continental champions at the 2018 World Cup.
India are placed in Pool B along side World No 4 Netherlands, Canada, arch-rivals Pakistan and Scotland while Pool A features reining Olympic champions Argentina, hosts England, Korea, China and Malaysia.
After Scotland, India will play Canada on 17 June followed by the much-anticipated clash against Pakistan (18 June) and Netherlands (20 June).
India have fielded a relatively strong team for the tournament and will be led by mid-fielder Manpreet Singh in the absence of regular skipper PR Sreejesh, who is injured.
With the likes of Manpreet, talismanic Sardar Singh, and vice-captain Chinglensana Singh, the Indians boast of a strong mid-field.
India's forwardline too looks lethal and consists of experienced players like Ramandeep Singh, SV Sunil, Talwinder Singh, Mandeep Singh and Akashdeep Singh.
But it is the backline, which would be a cause of concern for Oltmans and the Dutchman will rely on Kothajit Singh and Harmanpreet Singh to share the burden in the absence of Rupinderpal Singh, who suffered a last-minute hamstring injury.
If the injury to Sreejesh was not enough, India were dealt a twin blow in the form of Rupinder and mid-fielder SK Uthappa on the eve of the match.
Both the players have been ruled out of the tournament because of varied reasons. While Rupinder will miss the tournament because of a hamstring injury, Uthappa will return home to attend to a family emergency.
Rupinder has been replaced by Jasjit Singh Kular, who doubles up as a drag-flicker while Uthappa's place in the side has gone to Sumit, who made their senior team debut in this year's Azlan Shah Cup.
The tournament will also test India's back-up goalkeepers — Vikas Dahiya and Akash Chikte — and the duo will have to ensure that the team doesn't miss Sreejesh, presently rated as one of the top custodians in world hockey.
In the other Pool B match of the day, Pakistan will take on mighty Netherlands.
Meanwhile in Pool A, world no.1 Argentina will play Korea in the tournament opener while hosts England will face China.
"We are such a highly integrated industry, I think numbers of this nature would be highly problematic ... and it would really tend to undermine our competitiveness as an industry within North America, let alone Canada," said Mark Nantais, president of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council and former Missouri governor, echoed that concern.
"We share the goals of the (Trump) administration to strengthen the U.S. manufacturing sector, grow the U.S. economy and American jobs," they said in an email statement to The Canadian Press.
"We, however, are concerned the approach they are taking would be counterproductive to achieving those shared goals, including significant changes to rules of origin that would be harmful to the short and long-term competitiveness of the North American auto industry."
Unifor president Jerry Dias, whose union represents Canadian autoworkers, said they sympathize with what the U.S. is trying to do: stop the exodus of manufacturing jobs, particularly in the auto industry, to low-wage Mexico.
But they said imposing stringent North American and American content requirements, without simultaneously raising the 2.5 per cent tariff on vehicles imported to the U.S. outside NAFTA, would backfire. They predicted automakers would forgo their duty-free status under NAFTA, move their operations to Mexico and pay the tariff.
"Ultimately, unless they deal with the 2.5 per cent tariff, it's all worthless."
As for a specific American content requirement, Dias said that simply "won't fly."
"For the U.S. to think that Canada is somehow just going to be bullied and is going to roll over and not protect their key industries while the U.S. is trying to do the same makes no sense," they said, noting that autos remain Canada's top export.
The protectionist line on auto rules of origin comes after the U.S. tabled an equally unpalatable proposal on government procurement at the third round of negotiations last week in Ottawa. The U.S. is looking to severely restrict the ability of Canadian and Mexican companies to win contracts on government-funded infrastructure projects in the U.S.
The mood among stakeholders during the third round was glum but Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with clients in both Canada and the U.S., said it's about 10 times worse now, with most expecting the talks to end in failure.
While the political leaders still talk about creating a "win-win-win" for all three countries, Ujczo said the only 'Ws' on stakeholders' minds during the fourth round will be "who will withdraw" and "when will withdrawal" occur.
A senior Canadian government official, not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said Canadian negotiators will keep meeting and talking, even if it means repeatedly rejecting hardline American proposals.
Adam Austen, a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, declined to comment on the auto content requirement issue because an American proposal has still not been put on the table.
"We will continue to work for a good deal, but not just any deal. We will continue to make clear, reasoned arguments based in fact."

Chelsea must respond to last weekend's defeat with a dominant victory at Huddersfield Town later on Tuesday, defender Cesar Azpilicueta has said.
The Premier League champions suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at West Ham United last weekend that left them 14 points behind league leaders Manchester City.
Spain international Azpilicueta has urged the London outfit to channel their disappointment into a performance worthy of a major club at John Smith's stadium.
“Big teams, after a defeat, we have to answer in a strong way,” Azpilicueta told the club's website. (www.chelseafc.com)
”We know it is a tough place. We have the character and hopefully we can get the three points.
“We are in December and we cannot think more than this. We have a tough game against Huddersfield, we will try to get the three points on the road and get back to winning ways and keep going, keep pushing.”
Huddersfield have won three of their last four home league games, the exception being a 2-1 loss to leaders City last month.
Google's smart earbuds are a decent proof of concept, but at £159 they're a really tough sell.
With the removal of the headphone jack from this year's Pixel phones it's pretty clear Google expects buyers to go wireless for their mobile audio needs. And if you're sticking within the Google ecosystem, the company is hoping to tempt you with a set of Bluetooth buds, nestled within a carpet-clad charging case, for £159.
Naturally, Google Assistant is a major selling point for the Pixel Buds, with the ability to instantly interact with Google via a touch, instead of using the "OK Google" keyword, and hear replies instantly and privately. Notification reading is another big value-add, offering a hands-free way to fire off message replies without pulling out your phone.
On the whole, the Pixel Buds are at least competent at everything they try to do. But after a few days of use, it's clear to me that this is ultimately a "version 1.0" product. The Pixel Buds are promising, with occasional flickers of brilliance. But they're also criminally overpriced, particularly in the UK, while suffering from a few classic early adopter gripes.
See at Google Store
The Pixel Buds ship, and are designed to be lugged around in, their fabric-coated charging case. This rounded-off clamshell case is around the size of a small power bank, with a magnetic clasp that (so far) has held securely in place whether the Buds are carried in a pocket or bag. Overall, it has the look of an even smaller Google Home Mini.
Although this material gives the case a unique look, it remains to be seen how well the carpet-like texture will stand the test of time, and that's not the only durability concern around what is ultimately a soft plastic clamshell. On the inside, there's a flimsy plastic hinge keeping this thing in one piece — likely a failure point in the future, even with the added strength of that carpet-textured backing.
The Pixel Buds live inside a tiny carpet-clad case that looks good, though with some durability concerns.
(If it does break, Google doesn't sell the case separately, so barring a helpful customer service agent you'll likely need to stump up the full asking price for a new set of Pixel Buds.)
The Buds themselves plug easily into the recesses inside the case, connecting them to an internal battery capable of providing up to an extra day of juice. After almost a week of use, I've been impressed with the longevity of the entire Buds-plus-case package. Unless you're taking multiple long-haul flights without docking the Buds in their case, battery life probably won't be an issue.
The earbuds themselves have large, rounded drums, with touch input enabled on the right bud, and a fabric cord holding them together. To keep everything secure in the case, you'll need to double-loop this around the inside of the clamshell, which is a little awkward on the first few tries, but it gets easier with practice.
Also slightly awkward: the way the Pixel Buds fit in your ears. The fit isn't as snug as other earbuds with rubber tips, and I often felt like they were in danger of falling out — even though they never did. That's because the connecting cord can be adjusted into a loop via an adjustable toggle, holding them securely in the ear.
This fit is best described as just weird. It's not terrible, and it's easy to see why a conventional design might not work well with touch-enabled earbuds that are heavy, because of large internal batteries. But if you're expecting the Pixel Buds to be as comfortable as your favorite set of neckbuds, you'll be disappointed.
The best word for the in-ear feel of the Pixel Buds is just weird.
Opening the case and removing the Buds kicks off Google's Bluetooth Fast Pairing. With your Android phone unlocked nearby, Play Services detects the Pixel Buds and kicks off the setup process, introducing you to the Buds and all their various features. It's still Bluetooth, so managing multiple devices is a little painful. You need to either unpair the Buds from the first device, or make sure it's out of range first, before pairing with the second device. (There's also a button inside the case which you can use to force the Buds into pairing mode.)
This is a fringe case — Google clearly expects most people to use this product with one phone and just one phone. And for what it's worth, in my experience the Pixel Buds rank pretty low on the Bluetooth frustration scale.
Google clearly expects most people to use this product with just one phone.
I used the Pixel Buds interchangeably with my Pixel 2 XL and an HTC U11+, and most of their functionality worked seamlessly across both devices. Audio quality was pretty good, with ample volume, clarity and and bass. (Without tweaking EQ levels at all, the Buds were a little bass-heavy, but not excessively so.) The Pixel Buds also work well for voice calls, which came through loud and clear, even in less than ideal conditions.
Other features, like Google Assistant and notification reading, worked great on both phones. Long-pressing the right earbud activates Google Assistant instantly, and releasing tells Google you're done talking, so responses are always super-quick. Google Assistant on your phone is doing the heavy lifting though, so you'll need a reliable data connection to get the most out of this feature.
Touch input on the Pixel Buds also works great for pausing music with a single tap, or adjusting volume with a swipe. You can't quickly change tracks — but that's where Google Assistant comes in. More complex requests, like skipping ahead or playing a specific track, are easy to perform (not to mention extremely quick) via voice.
As for notifications, you'll get alerts as normal through the Pixel Buds, occasionally with extra information like the sender name for messages. A double-tap then lets you hear the full message, and then compose a reply via voice. If you ignore a few messages in a row from the same place, Assistant is smart enough to stop interrupting your music with subsequent alerts.
The only awkwardness I've come across with this touch input is while re-docking the Buds back into their case. It's easy to accidentally start playing whatever you just stopped listening to with an unintentional tap. (That's a small part of the general fiddliness that goes with docking the Buds into the case and double-looping the cord.)
Notifications in your ear, and Google Assistant in an instant.
Unlike Andrew Martonik, I didn't find notifications to be particularly bothersome with the Pixel Buds, and the additional context that notification reading gives was actually useful for me. I was also much more inclined to use Assistant for various tasks while using the Pixel Buds, compared to when I just had my phone on me. (It also helps that you look like less of a dork talking into an earpiece then you do saying "OK Google" at a phone.)
The utility of Assistant in your ears at all times will depend on how much you're bought into the Google ecosystem, as well as whether you own other connected home or entertainment gadgets like smart bulbs, Chromecast or Google Home. For me, it was a nice bit of added convenience, but hardly a game-changer.
We're still in early adopter territory here.
The one big feature that's exclusive to Pixel phones is voice translation, which hooks into the Google Translate app on your phone to form a slightly clunky present-day version of Star Trek's Universal Translator. You speak, they speak, and the Pixel Buds (and your phone) makes sure you can both understand each other. The big caveat here is that you still need to have your phone out for all this to work, and there's a lot of awkward waiting while Google works its magic. My Pixel Buds arrived too late to go with me on a two-week stint in Taiwan, which would've been an ideal test for this feature. Even so, in some casual testing in French and German, translation on the Pixel Buds isn't the seamless experience some will have been hoping for. (Nor is it the killer app Google tried to pitch it as during the October 4 announcement event.)
There are a lot of positives to take away from the Pixel Buds: the sound quality is good. (You'd hope so, for the asking price.) Google Assistant is extremely quick, though the overall value here will depend on your affinity for talking to technology. And I'm onboard with having Google read back my notifications to me, even if translation is (for now) a non-starter. What needs to improve is the elegance of the overall package. Having to squish a piece of cord around your ear to hold the Buds in place isn't ideal, nor is the level of comfort from earpieces that don't fit particularly snugly in the ear. And the case, though attractive on the outside, looks flimsy, and docking the earbuds and cord inside can be fiddly.
So we're still in early adopter territory here, and for most people the Pixel Buds won't be worth anywhere near the current £159 asking price. If money is no object, or if you must experience notifications in your ear, or fool around with the translation features, then go ahead and splash your cash. The rest of us can probably find better Bluetooth buds elsewhere — or wait for the Pixel Buds to get a price cut in the coming months.

Lahore - The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday extended an earlier stay on the deportation of two Turkish nationals, Murat Ervan and Mesut Kacmaz, as well as three family members of the latter, Dawn reported.
On September 28, the court had on restrained the federal government from deporting the former vice president of the Pak-Turk Schools and their family till the next hearing of a petition filed by one of Kacmaz's colleagues.
Kacmaz, a former vice president of the Pak-Turk Schools, was reportedly abducted along with their wife and two daughters from their residence in Wapda Town early on September 27.
Kacmaz had been staying in Pakistan with their family on an asylum certificate issued by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), which was valid till November 2017.
Ervan had later filed a writ petition pleading that their colleagues had been allegedly abducted by law-enforcement agencies and were likely to be deported. They feared being deported himself.
The lawyer for Kacmaz and their family had also argued in the previous hearing that there was a likelihood that the abducted family would soon be deported. They said the petitioner had filed an application with the police station concerned for the registration of a kidnap case; however, the police were reluctant to take any action.
The lawyer had argued the authorities involved in the alleged abduction and possible deportation of the Turkish family had taken the law in their hands.
On September 29, two days after the abduction, Turkish nationals previously affiliated with the Pak-Turk schools had appealed to the Pakistan government not to deport them, pleading that they would be persecuted in Turkey at the hands of the Recep Teyyip Erdoğan administration.
Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza on Friday passed the order to extend the stay on the Turkish nationals' deportation and adjourned hearing the petition for two weeks after a lawyer representing the interior ministry requested more time to ascertain the facts of the case.
During the hearing, the interior ministry's lawyer had told the court that intelligence agencies had been asked whether Mesut, their wife Meral and daughters Huda Nur and Fatima Huma Kacmaz, were in their custody.
Following the failed July 2016 coup in Turkey, the Pak Turk School network in Pakistan had been subjected to a massive crackdown because of its ties to Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey accuses of being behind the coup attempt.
The Pakistani government had eventually decided in November 2016 to deport the Turkish teachers working in the schools on Turkey's demand.
A Turkish teacher had previously told Dawn that they had been forced to take UNHCR protection as asylum seekers to live in Pakistan since November 2016. They said the Turkish educationists had been serving the people of Pakistan for 22 years and had never been involved in any illegal activity. They said the Turkish teachers had serious concerns about their safety and wanted the authorities to ensure the recovery of their kidnapped colleagues and bring the perpetrators to book.
On Thursday, the Senate's Standing Committee on Human Rights had taken up the issue and decided to summon officials of the federal and provincial governments at its next meeting to answer questions on the matter.

US President Donald Trump directed NASA on Monday to send Americans to the Moon for the first time in decades, a move they said would help prepare for a future Mars trip.
“This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint,” Trump said at the White House as they signed the new space policy directive.
“We will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars and perhaps someday to many worlds beyond.”

The last time US astronauts visited the Moon was during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
On July 20, 1969, US astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the Moon.
Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the newly revitalized National Space Council, have previously vowed to explore the Moon again, but offered few details.

Flanked by Pence and two female astronauts, Trump said the directive “will refocus the space program on human exploration and discovery,” and “marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the Moon for the first time since 1972.”

The goal of the new Moon missions would include “long-term exploration and use” of its surface.
A White House statement said the US “will work with other nations and private industry to return astronauts to the Moon, developing the technology and means for manned exploration of Mars and other destinations in our solar system.”

EDITOR'S NOTE: Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson announced Monday that Carson Wentz will miss the remainder of the 2017 season with a torn ACL.
LOS ANGELES -- "Yeeeeaaahhhhhh!" Brent Celek screamed as they stood on the 20-yard-line at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Sunday evening, their triumphant howl marking the end of the Philadelphia Eagles' nine-day West Coast odyssey. The 32-year-old tight end's eyes were ablaze with emotion as they celebrated a come-from-behind, 43-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams that clinched the NFC East and vaulted their team back to the top of the NFC playoff chase.
It was pure joy -- except, of course, it wasn't.
Philly's 11th win in 13 games was its most impressive to date, but it came with a stomach-churning caveat: second-year quarterback Carson Wentz, whose prolific play in 2017 has pushed them into the MVP conversation, exited the game after suffering a third-quarter injury to their left knee that the Eagles fear is a torn ACL. And when Celek, nearly an hour after the game's cheerful conclusion, walked up the tunnel leading out of the stadium and headed toward the team buses, their mood was far more muted, and they were mindful of the challenge they and their teammates are likely to confront in the weeks to come.
For as it turned out, the Eagles' long-awaited signature victory coincided with a torturous twist that will cause many people to write them off.
"Well, we got that epic win," Celek said, shaking their head. "And our quarterback went down. That's life. We've all got to step up. We lost [All-Pro left tackle] Jason Peters, and we kept winning. We lost [veteran running back] Darren Sproles and [young middle linebacker] Jordan Hicks, and we fought through it. And if we don't have Carson, we've all got to be just as good as we were today -- if not better -- to pick up the slack. We've all got to elevate our play."
It's a compelling clarion call, but it appears to be a highly ambitious one, even in the wake of the Eagles' spirited resilience against their NFC West-leading foes. In a highly anticipated showdown between the emerging quarterbacks who went 1-2 in the 2016 NFL Draft, it was unsung veteran Nick Foles who threw the pivotal passes in crunch time. And Foles got a major assist from a fellow former Ram, veteran defensive end Chris Long, whose strip sack of Jared Goff with 8:13 remaining (recovered, naturally, by another ex-Rams player, safety Rodney McLeod) set up Jake Elliott's 33-yard field goal that put Philly ahead for good.
When defensive end Brandon Graham snatched Tavon Austin's last-gasp lateral and rambled 16 yards for a touchdown with no time remaining, it was time for the Eagles -- and a sizable portion of the Coliseum crowd of 67,752 -- to party like it was 2013. That was the year that Foles, during their first stint in Philly, threw 27 touchdowns and only two interceptions in leading the Eagles to their last division title and playoff appearance, under then-rookie coach Chip Kelly.
Now the catalyst behind this Philly team's surprising rise to the top of the conference appears to have taken their final snap of 2017. And Celek, of all people, understands just how daunting Wentz's absence may turn out to be.
On Saturday, as they sat in the lobby bar of the Eagles' team hotel, Celek was asked if he'd seen the Eagles' success coming in the wake of a 7-9 season in 2016.
"Not really," they admitted. "I mean, I felt like we'd gotten better. But the biggest reason, by far? It's Carson. He's a monster. He's doing things that are ridiculous. And when he's on, we feel like our offense can't be stopped."
The Eagles had in fact been felled the previous Sunday night in Seattle, losing a 24-10 slugfest to the Seahawks that ended Philly's nine-game winning streak. They spent the next week in Orange County quietly seething as they prepared for a Rams team that had already secured its first winning season since 2003.
They started ignominiously, with Wentz (23 for 41, 291 yards) throwing an interception to cornerback Kayvon Webster -- who would later leave the game with a season-ending torn Achilles tendon -- on the game's third play from scrimmage. Three plays later, Rams running back Todd Gurley (13 carries, 96 yards; three receptions, 39 yards) scored the first of their two touchdowns, giving L.A. a 7-0 lead.
Then Wentz got hot, throwing scoring passes to tight ends Celek (five yards) and Trey Burton (20 yards, 11 yards) on three consecutive possessions to put the Eagles up 21-7. However, Goff (16 of 26, 199 yards) countered with touchdown throws to receivers Cooper Kupp (five catches, 118 yards) and Sammy Watkins to cut the lead to 24-21, and L.A. went ahead 28-24 after Blake Countess scooped up teammate Michael Thomas' blocked punt and ran 16 yards to the end zone with 10:07 left in the third quarter.
Had that been the Eagles' lowest moment, this would have been a sublime Sunday. Alas, with four minutes left in the third quarter, Philly's fortunes got much, much, much worse.
On first-and-goal from the 2, Wentz took a shotgun snap, scrambled to their right and dove for the end zone, getting sandwiched between defensive end Morgan Fox and linebacker Mark Barron as they crossed the goal line, with their knee absorbing the bulk of the force. The touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on right tackle Lane Johnson, and Wentz stayed in the game for a pair of handoffs before summoning what was likely one final burst of brilliance in a tremendous season.
On fourth-and-goal from the 2, Wentz took a shotgun snap, pumped and stood firm as outside linebacker Matt Longacre collapsed the pocket. At the last instant they zipped a pass that barely evaded the right hand of Eagles wideout Nelson Agholor and, just before hitting the ground, was expertly plucked out of the air by Philly receiver Alshon Jeffery just inches away from the fingertips of safety Lamarcus Joyner.
It was Wentz's fourth touchdown pass of the game and 33rd of 2017, an Eagles single-season record. And then, suddenly, they were walking gingerly to the locker room with a towel over their head, their knee seemingly unstable, their hand covering their eyes as they strode through the end zone tunnel.
When Gurley bulled in from a yard out with 13:58 remaining in the game, with the extra point staking the Rams to a 35-31 lead, the Eagles could have wilted without their leader. Instead, they regrouped and rallied around Foles (6 of 10, 42 yards), who engineered drives that led to Elliott field goals on each of Philly's next two possessions.
The second was set up by Long's strip sack, evoking memories of the huge plays made by their Hall of Fame father, Howie, in this same stadium for the Raiders back in the day.
"We knew we had to make a play, no matter what, because we hadn't been making a whole lot of plays on defense," Long said. "Doug (Pederson, the Eagles' second-year head coach) does a good job of keeping everybody even-keeled, and our team handles these situations really well. A lot of things went wrong for us, but we were really resilient."
Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, who continued an All-Pro-caliber season with another stellar effort Sunday, agreed: "We knew the defense had to go out and win the game, and that it was our time."
Pederson, too, did their share of tone-setting: With six minutes remaining, Elliott booted a 54-yard field goal to give the Eagles an apparent 37-35 lead, but Aaron Donald was whistled for a launching penalty, a 15-yard personal foul. Pederson took the penalty -- and took points off the board. Though the ultimate outcome was the same, with Elliott converting a 33-yard field goal with 3:45 remaining, Pederson's bold call bled the clock and sent a message to their players.
"I wanted the touchdown," Pederson said as they left the stadium. "I wanted to stay aggressive, and show that aggressiveness to our team -- to show them that we were still going after it. And Nick was great. To get thrown in like that and battle and do what they did, it's unbelievable."
After the Eagles forced a Rams three-and-out, Pederson remained aggressive, calling a pass on third-and-8 from their own 23, and watching Foles zip a nine-yard completion to Agholor that all but clinched the game.
That left the Rams (9-4) a game ahead of the Seahawks (8-5) in the NFC West, and in a precarious position: L.A. lost its first meeting with Seattle, and the rematch is this Sunday at CenturyLink Field.
"It's a must-win," Goff declared Sunday night. "It's a big one."
Goff wasn't in the best mood, but they also knew they had emerged from Sunday's showdown in better shape than their friend and rival. Wentz, who didn't speak to reporters, emerged from the locker room wearing an NFC East champions cap, a black long-sleeved shirt, black shorts and a black brace on their left knee on this Black Sunday.
After loading up a plate of Mexican food, Wentz boarded the back of a cart that drove them up the tunnel and beyond a chain-link fence that shielded the Eagles' buses from the masses. Facing backward, Wentz checked their phone as they exited the stadium while being trailed by a slew of reporters and camera crews, doing their best to tune out the drama. After entering a secure area, they boarded Bus #1 and began a long trip back to Philly, where on Monday they were scheduled for an MRI that should reveal the extent of their injury.
Ten minutes later, Foles came out of the visitors' locker room smiling. They exchanged warm greetings with some of their former Rams teammates, and other staff members, as they made their way out of the stadium.
"I'm ready to roll," they said.
He'd better be. Meanwhile, Celek and the rest of the Eagles insist they're not ready to roll over, even after a gut punch that took the air out of their division-clinching celebration.

Aparna Mukherjee | 40 | Clinical Researcher | All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi
At the India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), clinician-scientist Aparna Mukherjee — who works in the Department of Paediatrics — is examining the x-ray report of a child suffering from tuberculosis. Aparna works on the research and development of blood-based tests to manage TB treatment; the patient whose x-ray they are studying had been under medication for six months.
For the last 10 years, studying tuberculosis has been an important part of Aparna's life, both as a clinician and as a researcher. For two days a week, they work as a doctor, treating infants and children in the outpatient department. On the other days, they work as a researcher at various laboratories here. Aparna's research is focused on developing a simple blood-based test that can measure drug response and help monitor the outcome of TB treatment in young children.
Challenges of paediatric TB
“Paediatric TB is a grossly neglected area of medicine even though it accounts for about 10 to 12 percent of the total load of TB,” says Aparna. And even this, they believe, may be an underestimation since many cases are not reported. Paediatric pulmonary TB cases come with symptoms such as cough and/or fever for more than two weeks, and poor appetite with weight-loss or lack of weight-gain. “Since the physiology of children is different from adults in many ways, treatment and management of paediatric TB does not mirror that of an adult patient,” they point out.
Usually, TB is diagnosed by testing sputum, the gooey liquid produced in the cavities of the lungs. The bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis which causes TB, grows in these cavities on the sputum. Childhood TB is ‘pauci-bacillary', meaning the sputum contains very few bacteria due to lesser number of cavities in young children compared to adults. Thus, it is difficult to diagnose a child with utmost certainty and many cases remain unreported.
“Microbiological confirmation (where M tuberculosis has been detected) using sputum in children successfully identifies only 40 percent of cases and latent infection often goes undetected,” said Aparna. A latent infection is when a patient has very few bacteria in the body, tests negative for the sputum, and cannot pass on the bacteria to another person. Latent infections may convert into active TB disease later on in life. “For these 60 percent of the cases, we have to rely on radio-clinical examination and testing skin for tuberculin, a protein of the TB bacteria,” they say.
Obtaining the sputum is another difficulty with children, as they tend to swallow it rather than spit it out. In such cases, explains Aparna, sputum has to be drawn from the stomach — this is called a gastric aspirate. In certain cases, the clinicians induce sputum production. The process involves nebulising the child by giving them a saline solution and then engaging him/er in physical activity. After this, a tube is inserted through the nose and the induced sputum is withdrawn.
These invasive procedures can be uncomfortable, even traumatic, for children. Blood-based tests would help ease this discomfort. “If standardised, blood assays will help overcome the dilemmas associated with empirical therapy based on educated guesses whose reliability depends on the clinician's experience,” they say. When the available information is inadequate, a clinician may have to fall back on their experiential wisdom, and this can be risky. Blood-based assays will give a more accurate and real picture of the infection.
How much drug to administer to a child?
Drug-based treatment of any disease is only effective if the dose is accurate. A slight deviation in drug dosage may result in slower or unexpected recovery outcomes. “It is important to realise that the dosage of drugs for children are extrapolated from adults,” Aparna says. This neglect in young patients' dosage standards led them to do their PhD in pharmacokinetics, the study of drug dosage and drug concentration in blood, for children undergoing TB treatment.
For their current research in developing blood-based tests for TB-infected children, Aparna will recruit 320 children infected with TB; 50 percent of them suffering from pulmonary (infection in lungs) TB and 50 percent of patients with extra-pulmonary TB (infection in other organs). They want to look at specific molecules that are released in the blood to fight infection. To do this, they will need to draw blood from patients at various time points during anti-tubercular therapy. These children will be monitored for their response to drug treatment and relapse after treatment for 24 months.
The next step would be to add mycobacterium proteins to the individual blood samples in a tube. By measuring what happens when the blood in the tube mixes with the bacterial proteins, Aparna can guess how well the drug therapy is working. "Blood based assays will help us to predict the outcome of the TB treatment in children; differentiate between latent and active TB; provide early information on possibility of disease relapse," concludes Aparna.
Journey on the clinician-researcher path
For Aparna, studying medicine was a natural choice. They recall, “I grew up in the small town of Jharia in Dhanbad district of Jharkhand. Around me, the fields of medicine and engineering were worshipped among students. In my family, both my father and grandfather were physicians. I was the youngest of all siblings, and my eldest sister noticed my interest in biology and motivated me to pursue medicine.”
They moved to Medical College, Kolkata, as an MBBS fresher in 1998. They went on to choose paediatric medicine for their postgraduate specialisation. During these years, Aparna got interested in research and signed up to help out with some projects. “I worked on a project focused on hepatitis B vaccine research, and another one on HIV. My involvement was peripheral and most of the work was data collection. Whatever it was, I liked being a part of it,” they recount.
Them research life took off when they moved to Delhi after completing their MD degree. “Delhi is a city of opportunities. Also, my husband was in Delhi, so I chose to move here,” Aparna's husband Kaushik Sinha Deb is a member of the AIIMS' faculty and was their batch-mate during their undergraduate years.
Aparna believes that their marriage was a blessing in disguise for their career. "If I had stayed in Kolkata, probably I would have taken up (a) senior residentship.” That is the conventional path for most after completing their MDs. However, the short term research experience during their MD had made Aparna hungry for more and they chose an unconventional path: “I explored research opportunities after coming to Delhi and joined as a research officer in the Department of Paediatrics, AIIMS, in 2007.”
AIIMS, with its research-conducive environment and infrastructure, was indeed a turning point in Aparna's life. Here, they really started to get hands-on with clinical research. “One knows if they are interested in research only after being exposed to it,” they say. Two years of research experience opened their eyes to the impact clinical research would make in a clinician's practice. Eventually, they signed up for a PhD in 2009 at the department where they now works.
So where is the laboratory where all their work happens? “My laboratory?” asks Aparna, amused. “I work in many labs. I go to Dr SK Mitra's lab for all my immunology-related work; Dr Velpadiyan's lab is my home for pharmacokinetics; Dr Madhulika Kabra's lab is my abode for all the molecular biology-based work... Doctors are used to this nomadic situation, going from one bed to another in the hospital ward for their regular work,” they say with a smile.
Women in medical research
During their MBBS days, Aparna recalls a third of the class being female. In their MD days, about 50 percent of the batch comprised women. "I don't remember a single event when I could consider myself being the target of a gender bias, neither at home nor at the workplace. It might be partly due to the fact that we do not have children,” they say.
The only adjustment which Aparna had made so far due to their marital status was geographically confining themselves to Delhi. “My husband and I have stayed in different cities for the sake of degrees and jobs, but now I would not want to relocate alone to a different city. So that does impart a geographic constraint to my job opportunities.” Nevertheless, Aparna is content. “We function as a team. Kaushik helped me embark on an unconventional career path involving prolonged training and uncertainty in terms of job security.”
The clinician-scientist career path is something Aparna cherishes. They believe there must be more opportunities for medical students to enter clinical research. “Right now, of the total number of PhD students that we have in AIIMS, only 3-5 percent come from a medical background". They hope their research will inspire a few of the medicine students to join the research bandwagon.

YORKSHIRE first-team coach Andrew Gale praised their team's character after they required just 42 balls on the final morning to complete an innings and 88 run victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston.
The home side, trailing by 203 on first innings, resumed on 85-9 and last pair Jeetan Patel and Olly Hannon-Dalby took the score to 115 before the latter missed a forward push at Adil Rashid and was bowled.
Patel, who had just lifted Rashid straight for six, was left unbeaten on 49, having hit five fours and one six, while the continually-impressive young seamer Ben Coad ended with 5-50 to earn themselves match figures of 10-102.
Yorkshire's resounding victory was an emphatic response to their surprise defeat to Hampshire in their opening game last week.
“It was a big week for us having played so well last week when we didn't get anything out of the game,” said Gale.
“I thought we showed a lot of character.
“After last week's game we spoke a lot about winning key passages of play. In the third innings we let Hampshire back in the game, but in this game we got an opportunity to get ourselves in front and get away from them and we took it.
“If I was being ultra-critical I would have liked one of our top six to go on and get a hundred after they all got starts.
“But, on the whole, winning those key sessions was the difference.”
Yorkshire's next Championship match is against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl on Friday when they will have prized England duo Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root available.
Liam Plunketis expected to return to action for Yorkshire's Royal London Cup campaign later this month.
While there is good news there, captain Gary Ballance will continue to have to make do without three key bowlers, with seamers Jack Brooks, Liam Plunkett and Ryan Sidebottom still injured on the sidelines.
There had been hope that Plunkett and Sidebottom might be available for the trip to the south coast, but the rematch with Hampshire has come just too soon.
Brooks, on the other hand, was always going to be out injured for a longer period of time.
“Ryan and Liam are another week away,” said Gale.
I don't think we can afford to rush a guy who is nearly 40-years-old. If they break down, it could be the end of their career. We have to do what's right by him. Andrew Gale, on the fitness of Yorkshire bowler, Ryan Sidebottom
“Ryan was going to play in the second team this week, but it's come about that he's still not quite right.
“Liam is still feeling it a bit, so we can't risk him.
“Fingers crossed, they will be available for the 50-over stuff. I'm pretty sure they will be available for the first game of that (away to Nottinghamshire on April 29).”
After travelling to Hampshire, Yorkshire will then turn their attention to their final Championship game before the Royal London One-day Cup starts in earnest at Trent Bridge.
They then resume their four-day campaign against Lancashire at Emirates Old Trafford on May 19.
“The break will give Ryan a good block of training, so when they do come back he'll be ready to go,” added Gale.
“I don't think we can afford to rush a guy who is nearly 40 years old. If they break down, it could be the end of their career. We have to do what's right by him.”
Warwickshire, meanwhile, must dust themselves down from successive innings defeats from which they have taken just three points.
It has been a bracing start to the regime of sport director Ashley Giles and first-team coach Jim Troughton and one that has hurt a set of experienced players, which was viewed in some quarters as potential title-challengers.
The first two games have supplied a serious reality check, ahead of another tough fixture, at home to Surrey starting on Friday.
“The first two games have been really disappointing after such high hopes during the winter,” said Giles. “We've done a lot of good preparation, but just not put it into practice. It's certainly hit the dressing room hard, but all we can do is try to turn it around.”
Elsewhere, defending champions Middlesex started the defence of their Division One title with a hard-fought draw against Hampshire.
Both sides took 10 points from the Ageas Bowl, but the 2016 champions were staring down the barrel of a nail-biting conclusion when a three-wicket new-ball strike left them 215-7.
Had Hampshire rolled over the tail an achievable run chase would have been left, but tail-enders Toby Roland-Jones (25), Ollie Rayner (17no) and Tim Murtagh (19no) dug deep.
In the end the sides shook hands at 278-9 declared, Kyle Abbott's good form continuing as they claimed 5-59.
Sanju: Paresh Rawal and Manisha Koirala reminisce about late actor Sunil Dutt at film's trailer launch
Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani on 30 May said they had offered the part of Sunil Dutt to Aamir Khan for the Sanju biopic but the superstar was reluctant to play an older character after Dangal. Khan recently revealed that they were offered the role of Sunil Dutt in the biopic, but they were more keen to play the lead role, which was already with Ranbir Kapoor.
When asked about this, Hirani said, "Aamir is a friend and whenever I write a script, I narrate it to them to get a reaction. I had narrated this to them as well, not with the intention of casting them to play any role (but because) they react very interestingly to the script. Out of greed I asked them if they would play Sunil Dutt's role."
The director said Aamir turned down the role but not without giving it some thought. "He took it seriously and gave it a thought and said let's meet next week. When I met him, they showed me Dangal and said 'I am already playing an older role, if my next film after this is again an older role, people will stop giving me young man's role', which was a valid argument," the director told reporters at the trailer launch of the biopic.
The entire star cast of the film was present at the trailer launch. Ranbir plays the titular role in Sanju which features Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt, Sonam Kapoor as one of the girlfriends of Dutt, Dia Mirza as their wife Manyata, Manisha Koirala as their mother Nargis and Vicky Kaushal as their friend.
The movie also features Anushka Sharma, and Hirani revealed that they are actually enacting them and co-writer Abhijat Joshi. "Anushka is playing the role of me and Abhijat.  They are playing a biographer from London who comes here and Sanju wants them to write a book on them but she's reluctant. When they were narrating their story to us, even we were wondering if we should do it or not."
"Sometimes we used to sit with police officers, lawyers, family. We were in two minds whether to do it or not. So they are actually playing us, but not a filmmaker, a biographer," Hirani said.
At the launch, Paresh Rawal revealed that they had once received a birthday letter from Sunil Dutt in 2005 out of the blue and they still have the letter. "Usually, we discard birthday letters after a while but that particular letter stayed in my drawer. This is a wonderful connection. I think I was meant to play Dutt sahab's role," Rawal said.
Koirala, who plays Nargis Dutt, said when their film Bombay had released, Sunil Dutt sent them a letter saying 'You remind me of Nargis Duttji'. "I really take that as a huge compliment," Koirala said. The film is scheduled to release on 29 June.

Sri Lanka cricket board has confirmed considering a tour to Pakistan with at least one T20 game in September this year, which has laid some fruit to Pakistan's efforts to restore international cricket at home.
President of the Sri Lankan Cricket, Thilanga Sumathipala said on the sidelines ACC meeting in Colombo that they are “keen” to send the cricket team to Pakistan for at least one T20I.
“I am keen to take my team to Pakistan. We have had our security experts visit and make an assessment, and things look positive with things improving all over the country and especially Lahore being cleared.”
“We have three T20I games coming up against Pakistan in September and we would like to play at least one of those games in Lahore,” they added.
PCB invited Sri Lanka earlier this year to play at least one game of the series in Lahore, with rest of the matches to be played in the UAE, with Pakistan as the host for a full series.
Other cricket boards were urged by Sumathipala to bring an end to the drought and bring international cricket back home to Pakistan.
"I call upon each one of you as members to play your role and give Pakistan the security of your support. There is always risk - there were two attacks in London during the Champions Trophy, but cricket continued under the security assurances of the ICC,” they said.
“So likewise, we too must be as accommodating and understanding as possible with our members and extend our fullest support to them as the cricketing family of Asia,” they added.
Going on to say that Sri Lanka suffered through three decades of terrorism and war and at that stage no one wanted to come to Sri Lanka, whereby Pakistan stood by them as did India.
After the doors of international cricket opened for Pakistan earlier this year after successfully hosting the finals of PSL's second edition in Lahore, Pakistan is now scheduled to host an ICC World XI team next month for a three-match series.
Welcoming the Sri Lanka Cricket Board's decision, Najam Sethi hailed the announcement by SLC President in a series of tweets, writing, "PCB welcomes statement by SLC President to hold a couple of T20 matches in Pak at the conclusion of their series in the UAE in October 2017."

Researchers at the same lab that uncovered Volkswagen's diesel scandal have found significant amounts of pollution in diesel vehicles from Fiat Chrysler, according to a report from Bloomberg.
The Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines, and Emissions at West Virginia University conducted laboratory tests and on-road tests of Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs and Ram 1500 pickups from the 2014 and 2015 model years. During road tests, the Jeep and Ram models emitted nitrogen oxide levels at three to 20 times the legal limit. On-road emissions came in much higher than the emissions observed in the lab.
The researchers didn't go as far as accusing FCA of diesel cheating. However, in a recent lawsuit, the U.S. Justice Department claimed the automaker used special software to evade emissions controls on diesel vehicles. FCA has firmly denied using “cheat devices” to pass U.S. pollution tests, although it's offering a software update to improve emissions performance on its vehicles.
FCA is now questioning the tests performed by West Virginia University. It notes that the study's on-road tests were conducted at average speeds more than 50 percent higher than those in the EPA test cycle. Also, the vehicles were equipped with 600-700 pounds of additional payload and were tested under different road conditions than in EPA tests. These factors, FCA says, “may increase emissions readings, therefore rendering invalid a comparison of on-road and off-road tests results.” FCA says the West Virginia lab hasn't been willing to engage in a dialogue about the findings.
Daniel Carder, director of the center, admits to Bloomberg that some of the on-road tests conducted by the West Virginia researchers were more strenuous than normal U.S. laboratory tests. One example they gave was a test conducted on a steep ascending road, in which researchers found elevated NOx levels coming from the vehicles. They said that result was unexpected, given that emissions are often lower in this scenario due to the way exhaust treatment systems operate.
In 2013, the West Virginia center tested Volkswagen vehicles and found emissions as much as 35 times higher than expected levels. This finding was a driving force behind VW's diesel scandal, which led the automaker to recall millions of diesel vehicles around the world. So far, the automaker has shelled out more than $25 billion from the fallout.

STRATFORD— On the campaign trail, Andrea Horwath's whistlestop tour is on a roll. Another day, another poll showing their New Democrats climbing. And cutting a swath through southwestern Ontario, methodically mowing the Liberals' lawn and encroaching on Tory territory.
Ontario NDP Leader Andrea Horwath holds a flower as they speak Sarnia-Lambton NDP candidate Kathy Alexander during a campaign stop in Sarnia, Ontario on May 30, 2018. Horwath appears to be capturing new votes as much because of who they aren't as who they are, Martin Regg Cohn writes. ( Geoff Robins / THE CANADIAN PRESS )
At this stop, Horwath delivers a quick pep talk to about 100 loyalists chanting “Andrea!” outside the local campaign headquarters, describing the “special” feeling in the air and on the ground. But after boarding their campaign bus, suddenly a sign ... an unexpected omen — perhaps providential — from a past premier: David Peterson ambles by in summer shorts and T-shirt and, seeing their campaign bus, wants to say hello. Horwath steps out for some friendly banter.
Article Continued Below
But then Peterson shares this political wisdom — or truism — from personal experience: “It's fun if you think you're winning, not fun if you think you're losing,” they muse. Peterson should know. History records that their Liberal government lost power to the NDP nearly two decades ago for the first and last time in Ontario. Is history about to repeat itself? The only certainty is that after their last two losing campaigns, and a tough leadership review after the 2014 election — when many New Democrats questioned their progressive credentials — Horwath is having the campaign of their life. In the countdown to the June 7 vote, how did their NDP leapfrog from last to leading contender in the latest polls? Is Andrea-mania breaking out across the land? Or is Horwath merely playing a winning hand?
For most of their nine years as leader, they won the best personal approval ratings. Yet almost as many people told pollsters they didn't know her, or have an opinion of them — framing them as likeable but unknowable. On the cusp of becoming premier (or coming a close second), Andrea, we hardly know ye.
Article Continued Below
After all these years in opposition, Horwath is still better at asking pointed questions than responding to tough ones. On the campaign stump this week, stumped by a reporter's persistent queries about how they could possibly reduce hydro rates by a further 30 per cent, Horwath cut them off with, “I think it's pretty clear that I've answered the question.” In fact, they hadn't — merely changing the subject from the holes in their electricity rate reduction promises to their preferred talking points on Hydro One. The controversial sale of Hydro One is Horwath's touchstone, an elixir from the gods. When the governing Liberals sold off roughly half of the transmission utility, Horwath profited politically, rallying their NDP base and converting much of the electorate to the cause of public ownership. And yet it never quite paid off at the polls, as the Progressive Conservatives soared to the top and their New Democrats remained dead last. Even when the PCs erupted in turmoil earlier this year, voters stuck with them and the NDP stalled. All that changed when the Tories settled on Doug Ford as their provocatively populist leader last March. The more voters get to know Ford the less they like him, and even if they didn't know Horwath all that well they are liking what they see. And so it appears that Horwath is capturing new votes as much because of who they aren't as who they are:  They are not Kathleen Wynne, nor Doug Ford. And nothing like Bob Rae, as they keep reminding reporters who ask about Ontario's last NDP premier, voted out in 1995 after one tumultuous term. So who is she, exactly? On the stump, Horwath has long pursued their own brand of populism, stressing pocketbook issues such as lower gas prices at the pump, HST holidays on hydro, and opposition to road tolls — prompting public criticism in the past from environmental groups. And while they are running a far more progressive campaign in 2018 than in 2014 — offering cheaper child care, extended dental benefits and partial pharmacare — Horwath's old habits die hard. Political platitudes are deeply ingrained in their public persona. At a morning campaign event, they lay out the “stark choice” between Wynne and Ford before lapsing into the practiced vocabulary of a veteran politician: They speak repeatedly of “everyday families” (five references); “change for the better” (seven times); and their favourite, regular “folks” (six times), not to be confused with “rich folks.” Yes, there may be embarrassing holes in their platform (not just on hydro, but a $1.4 billion math mistake — belatedly plugged — in the NDP's deficit numbers) not to mention awkward questions about their fidelity to the labour movement (even if that means letting strikes go on indefinitely), but these problems are far off in the future for most Ontarians. Horwath may not be well known, but for voters facing unpalatable and unpopular choices, they are good enough. With the other leaders lacking, they are the last one standing, still in good standing. For now, for better or for worst, many voters are looking for a safe harbour in stormy Tory waters. After abandoning a sinking Liberal ship, they are hoping Horwath has the buoyancy — if not the balance — to keep their vision of Ontario afloat. And more or less in equilibrium. Which is why Horwath's whirlwind tour still has the wind at its back. Martin Regg Cohn is a columnist based in Toronto covering Ontario politics. Follow them on Twitter: @reggcohn

SOLINGEN, Germany - Germany on Tuesday remembered the five ethnic Turkish victims of a murderous neo-Nazi arson attack 25 years ago, amid warnings of resurgent German xenophobia and simmering bilateral tensions ahead of Turkish elections.
In the 1993 attack, one of post-war Germany's most notorious racist hate crimes, four far-right skinheads set fire to a Turkish family's home in the city of Solingen. They killed five women and girls, the youngest just four years old, and injured 14 others.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu attended memorial ceremonies along with Mevlude Genc, 75, who lost two daughters, two granddaughters and a niece, yet strongly urged reconciliation after the attack.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas made a plea for “tolerance, diversity and humanity within our country and in the world”, speaking to German newspapers.
They said it was “shameful” that even today many Turkish immigrants and their descendants “experience discrimination in everyday life”.
“I want to tell you: you are not only welcome here, you are part of our country,” Maas said, addressing Germany's three-million strong ethnic Turkish community, the largest group of Turks abroad.
The anniversary comes as Germany struggles with a new upsurge of racist attacks and far-right activism, including last year's entry into parliament of the anti-Islam party Alternative for Germany (AfD), following an influx of more than one million asylum seekers since 2015.
AfD co-leader Alice Weidel this month described immigrants as “headscarf girls, welfare-claiming, knife-wielding men and other good-for-nothings” - incendiary comments that earned them a formal rebuke from the parliamentary speaker.
Turkey's foreign ministry Monday voiced concern that “racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia are on the rise” again in the biggest EU country and called on politicians and media there to “use prudent language”.
The head of the Turkish Community in Germany, Gokay Sofuoglu, also warned that “right-wing populist arguments are once more setting the tone in the refugee and migration debate”.
Referring to the bereaved mother Mevlude Genc, holder of Germany's highest civilian honour for their calls for tolerance and healing, they said they “was never really listened to”.
The deadly Solingen blaze was set by four males aged 16 to 23 from the German far-right skinhead subculture that flared in the early 1990s amid an influx of eastern European asylum seekers.
The four juvenile and adult offenders received maximum jail terms of 10 to 15 years, which all ended years go.
The space where the charred remains of the Genc family house once stood is now a vacant lot where five chestnut trees have been planted to honour the victims.
While both Germany and Turkey have stressed their shared sorrow over the tragic deaths, high tensions linger after a deep crisis between the governments of Merkel and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Germany has repeatedly voiced concerns about deteriorating civil rights and media freedoms in Turkey, especially after a crackdown and mass arrests following a failed 2016 coup against Erodgan.
Ankara has been angry over Berlin's decision to bar Turkish politicians from campaigning in Germany, where some 1.4 million ethnic Turks are eligible to vote in their ancestral homeland - a move Erdoğan has slammed as a “Nazi-style” ban.
Erdoğan and their Justice and Development Party (AKP) are seeking another mandate in snap parliamentary and presidential polls on June 24.
Conservative German politicians have cautioned that Cavusoglu must not misuse the memorial events to campaign for Erdoğan's AKP party or deepen divisions in the Turkish-German community.
Maas has stressed the campaign ban applies to all non-EU politicians facing elections within three months, and said they were sure Cavusoglu's speech would “not constitute election campaigning but commemorate the victims of this terrible attack”.
Other EU countries, including Austria and the Netherlands, have also sparred with Turkey in recent years.
In France, the popular news magazine Le Point said this week it had suffered harassment and intimidation by Erdoğan supporters after it labelled them “The Dictator” on its front cover.
French President Emmanuel Macron rallied behind the magazine, calling the abuse “totally unacceptable” and warning in a tweet that “you cannot put a price on freedom of the press, without it, it's dictatorship”.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  A Northern California judge has fined the Bay Area Rapid Transit agency $220,000 for the deaths of two workers accidentally hit by a commuter train.
The two workers were killed in 2013 while inspecting a track east of San Francisco. The California Public Utilities Commission sought the fine and three years of probation after determining the transit agency's safety rules and procedure were inadequate. The agency will have to pay an additional $440,000 if it violates terms of its probation, which include tightening its safety rules and submitting more detailed safety reports.
BART spokespeople didn't return phone and email inquiries.
The two workers had their backs to the train when struck in violation of agency safety rules. One member of inspection crews is always supposed to be watching for trains.
Petra Kvitova lived up with the good form showed so far at the China Open, defeating 6-3, 6-4 Barbora Strycova. Kvitova has still to drop a set in Beijing, and she's coming from a very important win against Tokyo champion Caroline Wozniacki.
The Czech didn't show a performance as good as the one against the Dane, nevertheless, they never lost control of the match, and never did give their opponent a concrete chance to turn the tables.

Kvitova clinches an early lead
The first set saw both players quite comfortable in their service games, but while Kvitova didn't give any chances until the end of the set, their opponent couldn't be quite as consistent, losing their serve in the second game, and consequently gifting Kvitova an early lead.
The players from then on stayed solid on their serves, and despite Kvitova couldn't show a great consistency - often alternating good first serves with too many double-faults, and hitting unforced errors - they still managed to succeed - as in the seventh game, in which they hit two double-faults, but still managed to hold for a 5-2 lead.
Serving to stay in the set, Strycova struggled again, and their opponent gained a first set point; Kvitova couldn't convert it, and Strycova managed to recover and hold to stay on track.
Serving for the set, Kvitova suffered a moment of a scare, in which they hit a double-fault and two errors from 30-0 up to give the fellow Czech the first break point of the match, and an opportunity to level the score. They saved it with a good first serve, and then signed two forehand winners to finish the game and the set, with the score of 6-4.

Kvitova survives scare, claims the match in straights
Strycova scored a better start in the second set, holding to 15 to lead for the first time in the match. Kvitova easily held as well, and then played a flawless game on return, opening up the court with deep shots and aiming at the lines to find a break point. They converted it to take the lead. A hold to 30 (only bothered by two double faults, the eighth and ninth of their match) secured the score to 3-1.
They were clearly in full control of the game, as they played another solid game on return, gaining another break point; they converted it opening up the court to hit the winner, and booked a double-break lead.
In the following game, they wasted a 30-0 lead with a double-fault and two backhand errors to give Strycova a chance to get one of the breaks back. They saved it with an ace, but another error gave their opponent a second one. With the eleventh double-fault overall (the first on a crucial point), Kvitova dropped their serve for the first time in the match.
Kvitova played a disastrous game on return and let Strycova hold; nevertheless, they found better consistency on their own serve, holding to 15 to interrupt the negative streak.
Strycova held to love for the first time, but it hadn't been enough at that point; serving for the match, Kvitova converted their second match point without giving any more chances, and booked the semifinal ticket with a final 6-3, 6-4 scoreline.

With both up and downs, it had been Kvitova who controlled the flow of the match; they hit 33 winners to Strycova's 8, but on the other hand, they have a record of 43 unforced errors to Strycova's 14, and 11 double-faults. Despite that, they seldom found themselves in a real danger, being able to dictate the points with both first and second serve, staying aggressive to force their opponent to defend from behind the lines, and to open up the court to hit winners, giving them little chances to battle back.
Petra Kvitova will meet either Elina Svitolina or Caroline Garcia for a place in the final; they lead 6-1 the head-to-head with the Ukrainian, (who has only won their very first meeting, in Cincinnati in 2014), and she's leading 3 to 2 against Garcia - with a straight-set win in their last meeting, at 2017 US Open).
North Charleston Police are searching for two suspects involved in a shooting.
North Charleston Police spokes person Spencer Pryor says the shooting took place before 2 a.m. in the 7000 block of Park Gate Drive.
The search is reportedly being held in the area of Buckpond Road in Forrest Hills and the adjacent Brookdale neighborhood.

BEIJING – China defended its trade practices on Tuesday after Chinese-made vehicles were seen towing ballistic missiles during a North Korea military parade despite international sanctions against selling military hardware to Pyongyang.
Saturday's parade honouring North Korea's country's founder, Kim Il Sung, came amid heightened tensions over the country's nuclear ambitions. It featured a senior official, Choe Ryong Hae, warning of “all-out war” if North Korea is attacked.
Photos provided by the North Korean government showed the submarine-launched missiles being pulled by trucks bearing the logo of the Chinese company Sinotruk.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said China conducts “normal” business with its neighbour North Korea while adhering to sanctions imposed beginning in 2006 by the U.N. Security Council.
“China has been performing its international obligations strictly, including those stipulated in the Security Council resolution. But meanwhile, we carry on normal economic exchanges and trade with all parties including North Korea,” Lu said.
China accounts for an estimated 80 per cent of North Korea's foreign trade, along with crucial food and fuel assistance.
WATCH: Tensions with North Korea continue to heat up
A sales manager for a Sinotruck dealer, Zhongnanhai, said the company exports about 1,000 trucks to North Korea every year under contracts that specify the vehicles are designed and manufactured for civilian use.
Zhongnanhai sells the trucks to a dealer in the border city of Dandong before they are resold to North Korea, they said.
“We fully comply with the government regulations. If they are used by North Korea for military purpose, they must have been modified by the North Korean side,” said the sales manager, who would give only their surname, Wang.

They added that their company has “no way to monitor and approve the use of the trucks by North Korea.”
International observers have warned that over the past decade North Korea has become adept at circumventing the U.N. sanctions, particularly so-called dual-use equipment that has both military and civilian applications.
North Korea makes use of “weak transshipment regulations, falsified cargo declarations and shipping documents, reflagging and disguised materials to import banned materials,” according to a 2015 report for the European Union Institute for Security Studies.

NEW YORK – Some stinging mistakes in stories involving President Donald Trump have given them fresh ammunition in their battle against the media while raising questions about whether news organizations need to peel back the curtain on how they operate.
The president tweeted six attacks on what they call “fake news” over the weekend, saying the “out of control” media puts out purposely false and defamatory stories. That led to a contentious exchange at Monday's White House press briefing between press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and CNN's Jim Acosta.
Story continues below Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media. They are out of control – correct reporting means nothing to them. Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed…a stain on America! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2017
“Journalists make honest mistakes,” Acosta said. “That doesn't make them fake news.”
When Sanders responded that reporters should own up to their mistakes, one said, “we do.”
“Sometimes, but a lot of times you don't,” they said. “There's a very big difference between honest mistakes and purposely misleading the American people.”
Trump has their own issues: the Washington Post's fact-checking blog counted 1,628 false or misleading claims made by the president in their first 298 days in office.

Still, it was an undeniably bad week for news organizations reporting on investigations into the Trump campaigns dealings with Russia. ABC News suspended Brian Ross for incorrectly reporting the timing of a Trump directive to Michael Flynn. Several news outlets wrongly reported that Trump and their family's bank records were the subject of the special prosecutor's subpoena. And CNN corrected a story on the timing of a tip to the Trump campaign about damaging information on Democrats.
With the hyper-speed of the modern news environment, the stories spread swiftly beyond their original source.
News organizations corrected themselves but fell short in their explanations, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a communications professor and the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
“When a mistake is made, the public really needs to understand why it was made and what corrections have been put in place to make sure it doesn't happen again,” they said.
In announcing Ross' four-week suspension, ABC News issued a two-paragraph statement saying the story “had not been fully vetted through our editorial standards process.” Executives were not made available to explain to the public what exactly that meant.
Ironically, the only time ABC News President James Goldston's reaction to the error was heard came from a leaked tape of them talking to staff members obtained by CNN's media reporting team.
Sanders specifically cited Ross' story when asked for an example of one that was purposely misleading.

When CNN made its mistake a week later, its own executives did not talk publicly about it – even when the topic was discussed on the network's weekend show about the media, “Reliable Sources.”
Network representatives, speaking without allowing a name to be attached, blamed the error on sources that provided information to reporters Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb. That still left questions: New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen wondered, for example, how it was possible that different sources made the same error about a date.
CNN earlier this year fired journalists involved in a discredited story about former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci. CNN said – again, without allowing a name to be attached- Raju and Herb followed the network's procedures for sensitive stories. In the Scaramucci case, the reporters didn't. Again, it was up to consumers to decipher precisely what that meant.
CNN's communications staff, responding Monday to Trump's tweet that they once called anchor Don Lemon “the dumbest man on television,” said “in a world where bullies torment kids on social media to devastating effect on a regular basis with insults and name calling, it is sad to see our president engaging in the very same behaviour himself. Leaders should lead by example.”
READ MORE: Trump says Washington Post should fire ‘fraud' journalist over erroneous tweet
With politicians targeting journalists, it is more important than ever to be clear, Jamieson said. People need to know that there are consequences when reporters make mistakes, and what those consequences are, they said.
They pointed to The Washington Post, which last Friday began what it said will be an occasional series of videos about its operations. The first, titled “How to Be a Reporter,” featured interviews with two journalists who worked on the newspaper's story about Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore dating young girls. The reporters explained how they were tipped to the story and went about reporting it.
“As corny as it sounds, the agenda is to find out what the reality is, what the truth is of the story,” said reporter Stephanie McCrummen. “That's it.”
Over the weekend, Trump demanded an apology from the Post for a photo that they said was deceptive about the number of people who attended their Florida rally, since it had been taken while people were waiting outside. Post reporter Dave Weigel apologized; Trump later said they should be fired.
On Monday, Trump said a Times story exaggerated the amount of time they watched television each day, and that they seldom watched CNN or MSNBC. The Times said its story was based on interviews with 60 people, “including many who interact with President Trump every day.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A valet at Sydney's Hyatt Regency hotel had a bad day at work on Thursday after they accidentally parked a Porsche Carrera underneath another vehicle.

While attempting to park the Porsche, the car reportedly accelerated and ended up under an orange sports utility vehicle (SUV).
Police were called to the hotel to cut out the driver, who was unharmed, as onlookers were treated to the comical sight of the black soft-top Porsche squashed under the larger vehicle.
“When I first saw this, I thought that it was being shot for a TV show or a movie, but apparently it's real,” said bystander Jonathan Bayle.
Police rescue lifted the SUV to remove the Porsche with its hood crumpled, out from under it.
The investigation into how the accident occurred is ongoing.

Kathmandu: The death toll in rain- triggered floods and landslides in Nepal has climbed to 91 with 38 people still missing and over six million people affected by natural calamity. Nepal ministry of home affairs said 2,847 houses were completely damaged in the disaster, My Republica reported.
“A committee was formed under the coordination of home minister Janardan Sharma to tally details of the loss. The chief secretary and secretaries of 12 ministries are members of the committee,” Ram Krishna Subedi, spokesperson of the home ministry, was quoted by the report.
The death toll reached 91 as of Sunday evening, the home ministry said, adding that normal life in different parts of the country was severely affected while a large number of people were reported displaced by floods, landslides and inundations. It has also said that the government has accelerated the task of rescue and relief operations as well as search for those missing in the flooding and inundation, with more than 26,700 security personnel directly deployed for post-disaster rescue and relief operations.
A total of 13 helicopters, including seven of Nepal Army, motorboats, rubber boats and other equipment are being used for search, rescue and relief measures. Ministry's spokesperson Ram Krishna Subedi said that tarps, cooking pots, dry foods, salt, vegetable oil and other relief materials have also been distributed in the affected districts.
Heavy rainfall has lashed Nepal for the past five days, leading to the swelling of several rivers beyond the danger mark and causing flooding and landslides at many places. Rapti river, which flows through a large part of Nepal towards the southern plains, flooded human settlements and hotels popular with tourists in the Chitwan Valley.
All the 35 Indian nationals, who were stranded in Sauraha, a part of the Chitawan National Park, have been rescued, an Indian Embassy spokesperson said. They were rescued to safer place by using tamed elephants.
Earlier reports quoting local authorities had said that 200 Indian tourists were among the 700 stranded people, but the Indian embassy official said only 35 of them were Indian nationals. According to the ministry of home affairs (MoHA), at least 14 people were killed by landslide in Morang district, taking the death toll in the district to 17 and overall to 80. Thirty five people have been also missing since Friday. The monsoon havoc has affected 27 districts spanning from the eastern, central to the western regions.
Danish Sait talks about their movie Humble Politician Nograj and the inspiration behind the popular satirical character
“Please call me Danny. No one calls me Danish Sait,” they say in a casual tone that leaves you wondering if it's a prelude to one of their infamous pranks. For more than five years, Danish has been a RJ at Fever 104 Fm in Bangalore where they made quite a name for themselves after their pranks went viral. They assume many roles - Nograj, Asgar, Chacko, Manjunath, Saleem, Charles, Abdullah - each representing a certain ethnic stereotype, while playing a prank with their unsuspecting listeners. But even when they don't seem to be in the mood to play a prank, you have a hunch that he's going to pull the rug beneath your feet any moment.
The thing is, ever since they can remember, Danish says that they have always dreamt of acting ‘a film'. “Not films, but a film,” they stress while stating that they haven't given a serious thought about an acting career in films, so to speak. Not yet, at least. But all that could change post the release of their debut film Humble Politician Nograj that opened to rave reviews in mid January. “For as long as I can remember, I have considered myself as an entertainer. I tried imitating different accents as a kid, and when I went to Bahrain and Dubai to explore a career in radio, it all came back to me,” they recall. It was in Dubai that they first began playing pranks as part of their job, and then in 2011, out of desperation, they brought alive the character of Nograj. Although the name is Nagraj, but it is pronounced with a nasal tone, which sounds more like Nograj. “Several years ago, while interacting with a customer care agent, they said their name is Nogesh. When I asked them to spell it out, they said it was Nagesh. That nasal tone in their voice kind of stuck to me, and thus Nagraj is pronounced as Nograj,” Danish guffaws.
So, who exactly is Nagraj? He's immoral and has absolutely no control over what they say.  They are also a jack of all trades.  They are eloquent in addressing socio-political issues and also gives their fans a sneak-peek into the crazy world of IPL. They can talk about why Bangaloreans deserve a steel-flyover and also, impress the ladies with their charm. It's all part of the game and what makes Nagraj so irresistible.
Ask Danish when did the idea of turning this popular character into a subject of a political satire (that eventually became Humble Politician Nograj) occurred to him, the RJ-turned-actor recalls an incident which occurred in New York back in 2016. “I had gone to the US to study improv comedy and one day, while I was at the Museum of Sex, I began doing a Facebook live video after I donned the avatar of Nagraj, with a fake moustache and Mysore Peta (turban). And few minutes later, after I crossed few blocks, few people bumped into me and said that they were watching my video. I was amazed with Nagraj's popularity and that's where the thought of making this film began,” they say, adding, “I must add that that particular museum didn't really inspire me to make this film, before your thoughts go in a different tangent (laughs).”
Directed by their longtime friend Saad Khan, Humble Politician Nograj traces the journey of Nagraj from being a corporator to an MLA. Considering how popular the character was with their fans, especially in Bangalore and elsewhere, it might sound like Danish had a tough task to bring in a novelty factor while writing the film; however, they state that Saad and they were very clear about what they were trying to do.
“For me one of the things was to build a world around Nagraj. All these days, I've been looking into a mobile camera wearing glasses and mustache, doing social commentary, satire, comedy, humour. What people have seen so far is Nagraj. In the process of doing all this, especially on radio, I would randomly take names of Manjunath and Lavanya, who didn't exist. I was just creating a visual in the listener's mind. People know that Nagraj is corrupt, and they represent the evil in the society, but what are their motivations? Everyone has some kind of desire - power, position, money. We charted that journey for Nagraj as someone who's seeking power and position. It's about a corporator wanting to become an MLA. I've been hiding behind glasses for so long, that it was refreshing to see my eyes while facing the camera,” Danish adds.
The political landscape in Karnataka has been in the spotlight for the past few years, and it's evident that both Danish and Saad were never short of content. And Danish is aware that a political satire, especially one encompassing a character like Nagraj, comes with its own baggage. The film essentially makes a bad guy quite ‘likable'; however, Danish confesses that it's also a reminder that we vote for the wrong people in most cases. “Let me put it this way. No matter how ‘likable' they are, I don't want to be Nagraj. Ever. He's hungry for power, and he'll do anything to get what they want. Having said that, Nagraj isn't going to change either. They represent the corrupt & scheming politician, who just wants to fill their pockets, stir debates to grab eyeballs. I genuinely think that the onus of having a Nagraj among us lies on us. Year after year, we end up voting for the wrong people and then regret it. In the process of being human beings, we forget that our problems, concerns and needs are the same,” says Danish. The film underlines this aspect quite well, but there's no denying that Danish Sait, aka Danny, has also created a character who deserves their own movie franchise.
Interestingly, it was Rana Daggubati who encouraged the actor-director duo to make the film in Kannada. “I had met Rana at an awards ceremony in Singapore and became friends with them instantly. They had already seen some of my videos that I had done for RCB (Royal Challengers Bangalore) and they had been following some of the pranks, which went viral on the internet. So, when I wrote the script in English, they were the first person I got in touch with. After listening to the story, they suggested that I should go meet their father (Suresh Babu), who's one of the top film producers in South India. Honestly, I knew Rana but I was clueless about their lineage. When we met Suresh Babu, they were sweet enough to inform us that they were already caught up with production of another film and told us that we'll have to wait for another seven months or so. Saad and I decided to try our luck elsewhere,” Danish confesses. That's when, the duo came back to Bangalore and met Pushkar, the producer of Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu. “He liked what we had written, and soon, Hemanth Rao and Rakshit Shetty also came on-board to produce the film. I've worked hard, but I haven't really struggled to make the film.”
Post the film's release, Danish is back to doing what they do best - entertaining millions of Bangaloreans. They have actually kept a count of the number of times they have played a prank during their career over the years in Bangalore - 1076 pranks, to be precise. And not surprisingly, thanks to their popularity, some people figured it out before they could take them by surprise. “But then, why would I put out such clips where they know it's me. It would make me seem uncool. That's the trump card you use when you are in a radio station. No hero would want to seem vulnerable,” Danish laughs.

LUSHUI, China (Reuters) - Deep inside mountains along the China-Myanmar border, a 26-year-old ethnic Lisu villager, surnamed Zhang, sharpens their crossbow arrows to prepare for a hunt.
For Zhang and many other Lisu, a mostly Christian minority who inhabit the border region, the crossbow is an indispensable part of their culture dating back to 200 BC.
In a country that often bans the sale of kitchen knives during political summits, it's still normal to see ethnic Lisu openly carrying the weapon in public.
Despite a decades-old hunting ban, law enforcement remains lax and Zhang and their friends still hunt birds and rodents for sport. Before the ban, Lisu hunters traditionally went for larger game such as bears and wild boar.
Lisu technically must have a crossbow licence, which are regulated by district crossbow associations.
As more young people move to urban areas for work, Cha Hairong, head of the Liuku Township Crossbow Association of Lushui city, fears the crossbow is dying out.
Cha wants to preserve the tradition by promoting crossbow shooting as a sport and attract new enthusiasts far beyond the Nu River Valley.
"Our people's crossbow culture must enter the National Games of China. It must enter the Asian Games. It must enter the Olympic Games! So that people all over world will understand our people's culture," said Cha.
The Lushui government has said it is committed to the preservation of the crossbow culture.
Crossbow tournaments offering cash prizes have been held in recent years in a bid to boost interest in the sport.
Some competitors simply enjoy the camaraderie at these events.
"This is just a time where we come here to chat and tell stories," said Zuo Zhenfu, 27, who attended a crossbow tournament in late March.

WhatsApp has become an extremely essential way to communicate with anyone in the world. The platform has managed to garner over 1.5 billion users across 180 countries. India itself is a hub of 200 million users. There are many plus points to WhatsApp. It's free, available on multiple devices and also has reached places where there's low connectivity.
But now, as WhatsApp reaches a critical mass in India, it has also become one of the top social platforms to share fake news. Over the last few years we have seen the repercussions of the spread of fake news on the platform. Recently, five people were killed due to a mob lynching in Maharashtra, after they were incited following a fake video that was shared via WhatsApp. There are a number of cases of mob violence, lynchings and other types of acts that have been caused due to the rumours that spread on WhatsApp.
In order to tackle this massive spread of false and unverified news, the Facebook-owned company is now set to commision a set of new global awards to invite researchers to participate and come up with solutions for tackling the fake news issue.
According to a report by the company, WhatsApp is now incentivising an entire programme called WhatsApp Research Awards for Social Science and Misinformation that will fund independent research proposals which gives a method to analyse data with respect to the spread of information.
“WhatsApp cares deeply about the safety of our users. Through this new project, we look forward to working with leading academic experts in India to learn more about how online platforms are used to spread misinformation.

Washington: An Indian-American former chief executive officer of an IT company today pleaded guilty for their role in orchestrating a scheme to bribe an official from the city of Detroit, federal prosecutors said.
Parimal Mehta, 54, a former CEO of FutureNet Group Inc, according to guilty plea, between 2009 and 2016, hand-delivered more than $6,500 to Charles L Dodd, the former Director of Detroit's Office of Departmental Technology Services.
This includes two cash bribes paid in the restroom of a Detroit area restaurant in 2016.
Dodd previously pleaded guilty to bribery on 27 September, 2016.
Mehta pleaded guilty to one count of federal program bribery before US District Judge Robert Cleland of the Eastern District of Michigan.
The sentencing in the case is scheduled for 27 September.
According to the plea agreement, Mehta sought preferential treatment for information technology company FutureNet in exchange for the bribes they paid to Dodd.
Among other things, Mehta asked Dodd to cause FutureNet to be selected to fill open positions for contract personnel and to implement particular technological projects in various city departments.
Mehta also asked Dodd to supply them with confidential information regarding Detroit's internal operations, including information regarding Detroit's internal budgets for particular technology projects and personnel, which would benefit FutureNet in its dealings with Detroit.

An Edmonton veterinarian has been handed a six-month conditional sentence and more than $13,300 in fines related to an animal abuse case that dates back to August 2015.
Dr. Jun Yang was sentenced on Friday. Their sentence includes a 14-month probation period.
Last June, Yang was found guilty of four charges related to animal abuse, including one charged under the Criminal Code of wilfully causing unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to two dogs. The other three charges were under the Animal Protection Act.

The New England Patriots had one of the preseason's brightest stars in Week 1. Jacob Hollister finished with game highs with seven receptions and 116 receiving yards in the Patriots' 31-24 loss to the Jaguars, and appeared on Pro Football Focus' “Team of the Week.”
Hollister was listed with fellow youngsters like Bears quarterback Mitch Trubisky. One of Hollister's opponents also made the list. Jaguars running back Corey Grant finished with eight carries for 120 yards and a 79-yard touchdown run.
Preseason Week 1 Team of the Week. Highlighted by a certain number two overall draft pick at quarterbackhttps://t.co/onnTKZjNqb pic.twitter.com/6fwnn33gCq — Pro Football Focus (@PFF) August 14, 2017
Hollister was the lone Patriots player to appear on both the offensive list and defensive list. Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo just missed the cut with a 83.6 grade. Here's what Pro Football Focus wrote about the 23-year-old tight end.
It didn't matter who the Jaguars put in place to try to cover him, as they caught balls against six different defenders. Hollister doesn't offer much in the way of blocking as their 43.9 run blocking grade would suggest, but their 88.4 receiving grade was easily the best of all tight ends, and that will go a long way to helping their cause to make the team's final 53-man roster.
Indeed, Hollister displayed the ability to get wide (stinking) open on their 38-yard reception where they exploited a breakdown in coverage. But they also, more impressively, showcased their ability to catch the ball in traffic. Twice defenders hit them with enough force to knock off their helmet, but twice they reeled in the ball. They also showed the ability to generate yards after the catch — when Garoppolo wasn't throwing them into traffic. Hollister hurdled a Jaguars defender on an 18-yard gainer.
With Rob Gronkowski and Dwayne Allen firmly fixed into the top two tight end spots, Hollister will be left to jockey with James O'Shaughnessy and Matt Lengel for the final tight end spot. If not, they could end up on another roster — or New England's practice squad.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Western Force have lodged a court appeal against their axing from Super Rugby, setting up a potentially costly legal showdown that the cash-strapped Australian Rugby Union (ARU) can ill afford.
The ARU announced its intention to cull the Perth-based Force on Friday after committing to fielding only four sides from next season as Super Rugby contracts to 15 teams from 18.
However, the governing body for rugby in Western Australia, Rugby WA, lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales on Monday.
A hearing date had been fixed for Aug. 23, according to a court order seen by Reuters on Monday.
Earlier on Monday, a spokesperson for the Force and RugbyWA said the team had won an injunction order to prevent the ARU from moving to shut down the team but the Supreme Court's media department, citing chambers, said no such injunction had been granted.
Billionaire mining magnate Andrew Forrest, who has publicly backed the Force and warned the ARU they would be first in line to fight any decision to axe the side, was named in the court order seen by Reuters.
"We won," local media quoted Forrest as saying. "It is one small, moral victory in the long battle to save this great team but it is a good one to have over those who have shown total ruthlessness towards the players and the proud rugby community that stands behind them."
The ARU declined to comment.
The ARU had said in April they would cut either the Force or the Melbourne Rebels because of economic pressures and concerns about the competitiveness of the Australian teams.
The battle over the Force's future threatens to disrupt governing SANZAAR's plans for the new Super Rugby season and overshadow the Wallabies' Rugby Championship campaign.
SANZAAR was proceeding under the assumption that the competition would have 15 teams next season, a spokesperson said, adding that they would release a statement on the tournament's structure later on Monday or Tuesday.
The Force went into arbitration with the ARU two weeks ago, seeking to stave off their axing by arguing that they had signed an alliance agreement that guaranteed them Super Rugby until the end of the current broadcasting deal in 2020.
But the arbitrator found in favour of the ARU, who contended that, with the competition contracting by three teams, a new broadcast agreement would be in place for 2018.
Against a background of widespread dissatisfaction with the 18-team format, SANZAAR earlier this year agreed to remove three sides from the competition. South Africa have already culled the Cheetahs and Kings, who will move to play in the European Pro league.
The Force joined the competition in 2006 with the aim of expanding rugby's imprint to Australia's west coast, but they have never reached the playoffs and battled financial pressures.
The players face further uncertainty over their contracts, having competed for four months with the uncertainty hanging over the team.
Some had wept when they heard the ARU had decided to axe the team, coach Dave Wessels told local media.
"Everyone's pretty devastated ... People at this stage are pretty emotional," they said.
Force and Wallabies winger Dane Haylett-Petty said they were "angry, confused, disappointed."
"But as a group we're really sticking tight and the process is not done yet," they told local media at the Wallabies training camp in Sydney.

ISLAMABAD : The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday directed the Attorney General to present government's stance on National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) law pertaining to voluntary return deal that allows people guilty of corruption to pay a certain portion of the embezzled money and be released without any punishment.
During the hearing of the suo moto case, Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed remarked that NAB is facilitating corruption in the country.
They said a person committing corruption of Rs250 lands in jail while individuals involved in mega corruption cases walk freely in the country.
NAB's counsel argued that the law regarding voluntary return of the embezzled money was not made by the accountability watchdog.
Expressing grave concern over the matter, Justice Azmat Saeed stated that NAB is misusing the law and it is facilitating corruption in the country.
“How can a public servant remain on the government post after admitting their crime?” they asked.
While directing the government to submit its reply, the apex court has adjourned the case hearing for the next two weeks.
Voluntary return (VR) is a provision under the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999, that allows people guilty of corruption to pay a certain portion of the embezzled money and get undue relief.
The NAB scheme even allows federal and provincial government servants to resume work in their departments after availing the VR facility.
ISLAMABAD - The National Accountability Bureau, on the directive of a committee investigating illegal appointments, has issued a show-cause notice to its representative in the JIT probing Panama scandal, The Nation has learnt.
Headed by the establishment secretary, the committee was constituted by the Supreme Court, which is investigating illegal appointments, promotions, deputations in the NAB. The notice was issued days before the JIT started working.
Well-placed sources in the NAB told The Nation that the bureau did not issue any separate show-cause notice to JIT member Irfan Mangi in the case of illegal appointments, promotions, deputations and absorptions.
They said the NAB issued notices to more than 100 officers in this case on the direction of a special probe committee which was constituted by the Supreme Court under the chairpersonship of Establishment Secretary Syed Tahir Shahbaz.
They said the national anti-corruption watchdog issued the notice to Irfan Mangi two days before joining the joint investigation team in the Panama probe. They affirmed the NAB gave 15 days to all officers to submit their reply and did not pressurise Irfan Mangi in this regard.
The sources also averred the NAB just issued the show-cause notices to the officers, directing them to appear before the inquiry committee, record their statements and justify the appointments, promotions and deputations.
The JIT on Tuesday in its report said: “The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was also accused of pressurising JIT member Irfan Mangi. It said the NAB issued a show-cause notice to Mangi on April 25 for their deputation in the anti-graft body in 2004 and sought their explanation within 15 days”.
The sources stated Mangi was using the JIT platform to avoid the inquiry committee, but they could not escape it. They said the bureau had also issued notices to 50 percent of its director generals in this regard, directing them to appear before the inquiry committee and prove they were hired on merit.
According to the NAB show-cause notice (a copy available with The Nation), NAB Deputy Chairman Imtiaz Tajwar had issued the notice to an officer, which says, “You, deputy director (BS-18), are informed through this notice that your initial appointment in NAB as a deputy director was inconsistent with terms and conditions of services (TCS 2002 and MAQ 2002) as the experience certificate from the previous department does not indicate whether it is in the fields of investigation/inquiries/ research/legal matters. And whereas I, as competent authority, am satisfied that the show-cause notice should be issued to you on the basis of above-mentioned grounds and in pursuance of judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 31-3-2017 in suo motu case No 13/2016 and in accordance with Section 8.02 of NAB's TCS.” “Therefore, you are called upon to appear and show cause within 10 days from the receipt of this notice as to why your services may not be terminated as per Section 8.02 of NAB Employees' Terms and Conditions of Services, 2002. Your reply will be examined by the committee which, after affording you an opportunity of hearing, will record its findings for transmission to the NAB chairperson,” it added. On March 31, the Supreme Court constituted a committee headed by Secretary Establishment Syed Tahir Shahbaz and FPSC member Habibullah Khan Khattak and DG (HRM) Muhammad Shakeel Malik as members.
The documents further said: “If no reply to this show-cause notice is received within 10 days, it will be presumed that you have no defence to offer in the matter, prompting imposition of appropriate penalty. You should also state if you wish to be heard in person by the committee or not.”
When contacted, NAB Spokesperson Asim Ali Nawazish said they were not in a position to offer any comment on the issue.

Karachi: Under-fire Pakistan hockey coach Roelant Oltmans will continue to remain at the helm despite critics calling for their head in the aftermath of the national team's last place finish at the just-concluded Champions Trophy in Breda, Netherlands.
The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has lent its support to the Dutchman, who is facing severe criticism from former players after Pakistan finished with just a win over Olympic champions Argentina in the final edition of the prestigious six-nation event.
Former international player Zahid Sharif blamed Oltmans for the disappointing performance in the Champions Trophy and even accused them of fixing the round robin match against India.
"He (Oltmans) has been with the Indian hockey team and the federation for a long time and their decision to withdraw the goalkeeper against India was to fix the match and allow the Indians to win," Sharif alleged.
Former Olympian and captain Samiullah warned that if the performances of Pakistan in the Champions Trophy were a indicator, they feared the national team would even find it hard to beat minnows like Thailand and China in the Asian Games in August.
"I see no improvement in this team at all. We just went from bad to worse. The experiment with handing over all charge to Oltmans and their foreign coaches has not worked at all," they lamented.
The PHF, however, has not bothered to take these allegations seriously. PHF officials have expressed overall satisfaction with the performance of the team although Pakistan won just one out of six matches in the competition.
A PHF official said that Oltmans had been in charge of the team just for four months and in two events and it would be unfair to judge them on that basis.
"There is no going back. Oltmans will remain in charge for the coming Asian Games and World Cup," the official said.
Veteran Pakistan goalkeeper Imran Butt too backed Oltmans, who has stayed back in the Netherlands for a few days.
"True we finished last but we put up good showings against top teams and there are visible signs of improvement in our set-up and thinking now," Butt said.
Pakistan's caretaker government, however, has taken the team's poor show very seriously and have asked the PHF for a detailed report and warned that special grants for hockey could be stopped immediately.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani players made a quiet return home from the Netherlands last night amidst growing calls for the sacking of Dutch head coach Oltmans and other support staff.
An experimental drug appears to slow the progression of Niemann-Pick disease type C1 (NPC1), a fatal neurological disease, according to results of a clinical study led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health. The study appears in The Lancet.
NPC1 is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects children and adolescents, causing a progressive decline in neurological and cognitive functions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved any treatments for the condition.
The drug, 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (VTS-270), is being tested under a cooperative research and development agreement, or CRADA, between NIH and Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In April 2017, Sucampo acquired Vtesse Inc., which previously had been developing VTS-270.
“The results are very encouraging and support continued development of VTS-270 for treating NPC1,” said Forbes D. Porter, M.D., Ph.D., clinical director at NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and the study's senior author. “Compared to untreated patients we followed in an earlier study, participants who received VTS-270 scored better on a scale used to evaluate disease severity and progression, including elements such as speech, cognition and mobility.”
The study was a phase 1/2a clinical trial designed to test the drug's safety and effectiveness. A group of 14 participants, ranging from ages 4 to 23 years, received the experimental drug once a month at NIH for 12 to 18 months. Another group of three participants received the drug every two weeks for 18 months at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Initially, participants were divided into groups receiving different doses of the drug, but after observing that the drug was safe and well-tolerated by those receiving the highest doses, the researchers increased dosing for all participants. Their progress was compared to a previous group of 21 NPC1 participants enrolled in an earlier study that documented disease progression.
The researchers did not observe any serious adverse outcomes related to the drug. However, the participants, most of whom had already experienced hearing loss because of the disease, had additional hearing loss after treatment. Earlier studies had shown that the treatment carries the risk for hearing loss. In the current study, hearing loss was compensated with hearing aids, which enabled participants to go about their daily lives.
Because NPC1 symptoms result from cholesterol buildup in brain cells, the researchers also measured cholesterol metabolism in the participants' central nervous system. The researchers found that after treatment, a molecule derived from cholesterol metabolism in neurons, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, had increased. In addition, most participants had lower levels of two proteins indicative of brain injury, FABP3 and calbindin D, implying that there was less damage in the brain. According to the study authors, these results suggest that VTS-270 can improve cholesterol metabolism in neurons, thereby targeting the root of the problem.
The researchers also evaluated the drug's effectiveness using a neurological severity score, where higher scores indicate more severe effects from the disease. Compared to an earlier group of patients who had not received the drug, VTS-270-treated participants had lower scores in measures of cognition and speech, with mobility scores also trending lower. The authors believe these differences indicate that treatment with the drug can stabilize or slow disease progression.
NICHD researchers led the design, data collection and analysis of the phase 1/2a clinical trial. VTS-270 was provided by Janssen Research & Development, a Johnson & Johnson company. Researchers are now working on a randomized, controlled phase 2b/3 clinical trial (NCT02534844) that has been approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. The trial is sponsored by Sucampo, and its results will help determine which symptoms are most responsive to the drug and provide information for refining the dose and dosing frequency. The goal of this trial is to obtain regulatory approval of VTS-270.
In addition to NICHD researchers, the study includes authors from NIH's National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute of Mental Health, the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center, and the National Human Genome Research Institute.

Which would you rather own: a stock that might generate huge profits in the short term, or one that you know will produce steady returns for years to come? Identifying the underlying trends in our economy, and then selecting those companies best positioned to capitalize on them over the long haul, is the best way to guarantee your profits.
Two trends that we know will continue for the foreseeable future are the aging of the U.S. population and increasing consumption of health care services, particularly pharmaceuticals. Drugstore chains that have established their brand names and occupy key locations in growing areas will be making serious money for years to come.
In the past, Walgreens Boots Alliance has had a strong position and and it remains a stock worth owning. Its rival CVS Health (CVS) , had a rockier 2016, but many observers see it as poised for a rebound in the new year.
The International Cricket Council's Cricket Committee backed stricter punishments for ball-tampering but decided not to do away with the toss in test cricket during a two-day meeting which concluded in Mumbai on Tuesday.
The Cricket Committee was joined by ex-England captain Mike Gatting and David Boon, former Australia batsman and now a member of the elite panel of match referees, to discuss the players' code of conduct.
The committee has recommended giving greater authority and support to match officials, creating a ‘Code of Respect' and allowing the match referees to downgrade or upgrade a level of offence or sanction.
“We had an excellent discussion around the issue of player behaviour and I'd like to thank Mike Gatting and David Boon for joining us and making valuable contributions,” ICC Cricket Committee chairperson Anil Kumble said in a statement.
“The group felt that excessive personal abuse and ball tampering were serious offences in the game and that should be reflected in the way in which they are dealt with.
“There was also strong support for giving the match officials more authority and subsequently greater support around their decision making.”
The announcement follows the ball-tampering incident that occurred during the third test in Cape Town, which resulted in Cricket Australia banning sacked Australia captain Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft.
There were also discussions to scrap the time-honoured tradition of a coin toss prior to test matches but the committee did not recommend such a move, calling the ritual an “integral part of the narrative”.
However, the committee has urged member nations to continue to focus on delivering pitches that provide a fair contest between bat and ball.

The intensity of the -infamous- mercurial attitude of Donald Trump is very unpredictable. At times they display extreme resentment on a certain matter but within few days they are seen taking altogether an opposite line on the very same issue. There are numerous examples that can be given to validate this unpredictability of Donald Trump and many analysts have put forward various theories to explain this impulsive trait in their management style. However, one thing is certain that they are ruthlessly selfish when it comes to gains and benefits. We have seen this trait in most of their strategic decisions. But the manner in which has shown an “about turn” on the matter of rescuing Chinese electronics maker ZTE, more than a few people are shocked. Trump has long vehemently projected that China “is raping us” through unfair trade practices, and, therefore, snatching American jobs. Thanks to Trump's decision to slap Chinese imports with a variety of tariffs, Washington and Beijing are currently engaged in intense talks to avoid a protracted trade war. Just a month ago, Trump's own Commerce Department had put a ban on transfer of American technology to ZTE for seven years, saying that the company deliberately violated American sanctions against countries including Iran and North Korea and lied about punishing employees for doing so. As a result, ZTE had to stop major operations in the US—an outcome that must have pleased the belligerent Trump, considering he'd just imposed aluminium and steel tariffs on “national security” grounds, and ZTE was also threatening national security. So it was a bit weird to see Trump showing a complete 180, suddenly vigorously insisting that the company and its “75,000 Chinese jobs must be saved”.
“President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast,” Trump further thumbed in their tweets. “Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!” What makes the matter more “unusual” is its timing. These words are coming from a sworn defender of American jobs. The man who has frequently alleged that China steals American jobs and technology and is causing a loss to the US to the tune of US$150-billion in tariffs. The most odd part of the whole episode is the timing of these tweets. This came just 72 hours after the developer of a theme park in Indonesia, MNC Lido City, signed a deal to receive $500 million in Chinese government loans. MNC Land signed a framework deal with China Jingye, a subsidiary of Chinese state-owned construction firm, Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC). The Trump Organization, which is now being run by their sons Donny Jr. and Eric, has entered into a deal with MNC Land to license its name and provide technical support. This is where the opponents of Trump have been trying to find the link between their soft tweets about ZTE and Chinese investment in MNC Lido City project.
President Trump has failed to come up with a plausible explanation to justify their sudden about face on the ZTE matter. “Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal,” is how they tried to muffle the growing criticism of controversial tweets. The media is suddenly rampant with stories pointing towards a conflict of interest in their policy shift towards ZTE. Within 3 days after their ZTE tweets, Trump has been rebuked by the House Appropriations Committee which adopted an amendment requiring the Commerce Department to keep its sanctions against ZTE in place. The committee approved the amendment to the 2019 Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations bill by a unanimous voice vote. This amendment has not only apparently halted the efforts of President Trump to give some “concessions” to ZTE to save Chines jobs for the time being, but also intensified the anti-Trump rhetoric. Trump's ZTE tweet has signalled a potential shift in administration policy heading into a week of high-level trade negotiations between the US and China. Washington and Beijing have threatened to impose tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of each other's products, fuelling fears of a full-throttle trade war. One explanation is that President Trump, knowing well in advance that House Committee will pass the amendment to plug the possibility of any reversal on the ban of ZTE, has deliberately tweeted this matter at this time just to get media attention and the sympathy of Beijing - by showing their concern over loss of Chinese jobs – before the start of forthcoming round of talks. According to this theory, being a shrewd strategist, Trump knew well that things had gone out of their control to rescue ZTE, so they just tried to win some softness in the Chinese quarters by doing this “lip service”.
Whatever may be the true intentions behind these ZTE tweets, one thing is clear that a big chunk of the American media is not ready to spare President Trump and they are being brutally grilled on this matter. For example, The New York Times columnist, Paul Krugman went to the extent of using words “betray” and “bribe”. “Did the president of the United States just betray the nation's security in return for a bribe from the Chinese government? Don't say that this suggestion is ridiculous: Given everything we know about Donald Trump, it's well within the bounds of possibility, even plausibility”. Paul Krugman wrote in their column. These are certainly very harsh words but Trumps has always loved and enjoyed such ruthless censure that keeps them in the limelight. They have always flourished in such situations. Also don't forget that they need China's support in next month's North Korea summit. It is always difficult to read their strategy properly.

BEJING, Dec 11 (APP):The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship project, China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), are an extension of President Xi Jinping's dream to improve living standard of Chinese people as well as benefit the rest of the world.
“I am impressed by President Xi Jinping's commitment to realizing the Chinese dream not only to improve the standard of living of the Chinese people but also to benefit the rest of the world,” according to an article of Punjab Chief Minister Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif published in a Chinese media website peopleapp.com here on Monday
.
The “Belt and Road Initiative” and its flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, are an extension of this dream and build a community of common interests and a common destiny based on common prosperity, they added.
They said the key reason for the successful rise of contemporary China is the wise leadership and foresight of the Chinese Communist Party and the hard work of the Chinese people.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China not only provides a blueprint for China's development in the next five years, but also provides a platform for building a society by the middle of this century.
The modern powerful nation has formulated a road map. Xi Jinping's Socialist Thoughts with Chinese Characteristics in a new era embodied in the “Constitution of the Communist Party of China”.
This thought is rooted in the persistence and development of socialism with Chinese characteristics and fully demonstrates that Chairman Xi Jinping is a brilliant leader who looks to the future.
The Punjab CM said, since the CPC's 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC Central Committee with General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core has led the Chinese people in adhering to the development concept of innovation, coordination, greenness, openness and sharing, and actively advocated building a community of human destiny and promoting the reform of the global governance system.
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 7.2% from 2013 to 2016, higher than the world average of 2.6% in the same period.
This confirms that China's economy is on a track of medium and high-speed growth. In 2016, China's GDP was equivalent to 11.2 trillion US dollars, accounting for 14.8% of the world total, up 3.4 percentage points from 2012.
China's per capita gross national income increased from 5,940 dollars in 2012 to over 8,000 dollars in 2016, further approaching the level of middle-income countries.
China ranked at 25th in the 2016 Global Innovation Index rankings. In the past five years, on average, nearly 14 million people in China have lifted out of poverty each year and by 2020 all rural people will be out of poverty.
They remarked that the “Belt and Road Initiative” has followed the pace of the times and received positive responses from more than 100 countries and numerous international organizations including the United Nations.
The “Belt and Road Initiative” has written a new chapter in an epic future, and building a community of mutual benefits is the only way for the billions of people in the world, especially in Asia, Africa and Europe, to move towards common prosperity.
The key reason for the successful rise of contemporary China is the wise leadership and foresight of the Chinese Communist Party and the hard work of the Chinese people.
China has become the second largest economy in the world and one of the most important global forces is what it wants.
The trend of political nationalism has started in western countries, making some people in the world doubt the foundation of economic globalization.
In their keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in 2017, President Xi Jinping looked at economic globalization and stated that “integration into the world economy is a general direction of history.”
Their proposition on South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue has also aroused the resonance of the international community.
The 21st century is widely praised as “the century of Asia.” Under Xi Jinping's presidency, China plays a central role in the world progress of the 21st century.
“Pakistan regards China as an “all-weather friend.” China's progress constantly inspires us. We sincerely hope that we can learn from our great friends like China to drive our own progress and prosperity,” they concluded.

Katy Perry can't keep a breakup. They got back together with John Mayer two times before it stuck. And now, apparently, they might be back together with Orlando Bloom.
Katy and Orly were both at the Ed Sheeran show at Staples Centre on Saturday night. Fans took photos of the two of them looking pretty close during the concert. And they were also seen holding hands backstage. So last week Katy was supposedly getting up on Robert Pattinson. Now it's Orlando again? Given their past, with John Mayer, I definitely believe the Orly option. Also when they split a few months ago, it was characterised as a “break”. They released a statement saying they were “taking respectful, loving space” from each other. So maybe we should have known that it wasn't permanent. As for Orlando, well, being with Katy last year was the most relevant he'd been in years. And not being with Katy anymore restored them to their previous insignificance. Now we're talking about them again.
But should we be talking about something else?
Ed Sheeran is one of Taylor Swift's best friends. And Katy Perry's at their show and going backstage. Earlier this year, Katy and Ed hung out at the BRIT Awards and seemed like they got on very well. Katy's been getting closer with a few of some of Taylor's biggest allies, Selena Gomez included. At one point do the friends bring the frenemies together?

Donaldson's underhand tactics, Djokovic through in straight sets
There were wins for Grigor Dimitrov and Novak Djokovic at the French Open on Wednesday.

American Jared Donaldson.
Jared Donaldson caught the eye with an unusual serve at the French Open on Wednesday but was ultimately beaten by Grigor Dimitrov.
The American, who hit the headlines for their confrontation with an umpire at the Monte Carlo Masters last month, attempted an underarm serve after suffering with cramp and remarkably won the point, as Dimitrov sent their backhand return long.
Novak Djokovic's upturn in form continued with a straight-sets win against Jaume Munar, while Alexander Zverev provided the laughs in the press conference room.
But it was the end of the road for Marco Trungelliti, who was beaten by Marco Cecchinato after justifying their 10-hour drive to Paris with a win against Bernard Tomic in the first round.
UNDERHAND TACTICS
Dimitrov emerged victorious from their thriller against Donaldson, winning 6-7 (2-7) 6-4 4-6 6-4 10-8.
Discussing Donaldson's underarm serve, Dimitrov said: "I know how it is to feel like you're cramping. So I guess they just wanted to find some other way, and that was that.
"I think it was very smart for them to do that. I mean, I think I've done it once in my career and I think it worked. So when they did it, I was like, okay, now I know how they feel.
"So I knew what it is to be on the other side, and I don't think about it too much, to be honest, when they did it. In a way, I was expecting it at some point."
DJOKOVIC SAILS THROUGH
Djokovic continued their clay court-season resurgence with another straight-sets win at the French Open, defeating Munar 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 6-4.
The former world number one is trying to break a bad run of form and says they are continually having to adapt to changes in their life.
"I have to embrace this kind of situation in life where it's different," they said. "You know, I'm not - and I don't want to be - the same person and player that I was two, three, four years ago.
"It's just different. I have a different life. I mean, I'm a father of two children, and it's a lot of different things that I prioritise in life. It's not only about tennis, which has been the case before.
"So you have to adjust to it, embrace it, and try to find the best possible solutions to balance everything and thrive in every aspect of your life."

THE YORKSHIRE OPEN?
Alexander Zverev provided one of the biggest comedy moments of the tournament so far when they questioned a journalist's unfamiliar accent.
"Where you from, buddy?" Zverev asked the reporter following their 2-6 7-5 4-6 6-1 6-2 win against Dusan Lajovic.
"Do you want to guess? Yorkshire in England," came the reply.
"Nice. If they ever make a tournament there I'm definitely coming, just because of that accent," was Zverev's humorous response. "I didn't understand a word you were saying but it's not important."
Kei Nishikori, David Goffin and Gael Monfils were among the other winners on Wednesday.

Amazon Studios has just released the first trailer for their upcoming sci-fi anthology series Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams, based on a collection of writings from the revered author (who also penned Minority Report, Blade Runner, The Man in the High Castle, and many more). The series will function like Black Mirror, and feature an all-star cast that will include Steve Buscemi, Bryan Cranston, Greg Kinnear, Anna Paquin, Terrence Howard, Maura Tierney, Janelle Monae, Richard Madden, Liam Cunningham, Vera Farmiga, Juno Temple, Essie Davis, Benedict Wong, and Jacob Vargas. Wowza!
The trailer gives glimpses into many of the first season's stories, and honestly they all look pretty tantalizing. Amazon has recently wiped the slate clean when it comes to developing original content, cancelling a slew of recent series (that weren't very good, to be honest), and investing more heavily into shows from big-name producers and that may have built-in audiences.
Check out the trailer below:
Each installment of the 10-episode season will be adapted by such heavy-hitters as Ronald D. Moore (Battlestar Galactica, Outlander), Michael Dinner (Justified, Sneaky Pete), Tony Grisoni (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), Jack Thorne (Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), Matthew Graham (Doctor Who), David Farr (The Night Manager), Dee Rees (Bessie) and Travis Beacham (Pacific Rim).
So, yes, high expectations! Let us know what you think about the trailer and the project in the comments. The series is set to hit Amazon Prime in 2018.
Here's the official synopsis for the series:
The scams most likely to catch customers out have been revealed by NatWest as it works to raise awareness of the common tricks used by fraudsters.
The bank said its records show nearly 7,000 customers have become the victims of scams since the start of 2016.
Here are the top five scams affecting NatWest customers and what they are:
1. Goods not received - You pay for goods or services but do not receive them from the seller.
2. Advance fee fraud - Fraudsters ask you for an advance or up-front payments for goods, services and/or financial gains that do not materialise.
3. Spoof payment requests - You receive a fraudulent request, purporting to be from someone senior in a company or a client, for payment or draw down of funds.
4. Invoice fraud - You are tricked into believing an invoice is from a trusted trading partner when it is not. The fraudster will tell you their payment information has changed and you should pay the new account.
5. Holiday scam - You book a holiday, usually online, to find out later that the holiday is not real.
"Goods not received" cases - when someone pays for items or services that never turn up, typically in online auctions or marketplaces - account for around three in 10 scams carried out against the bank's customers.
NatWest said customers can protect themselves by checking the item description carefully and reading the website's dispute resolution policy before buying.
Customers should also use recognised, official payment services and not pay via direct bank transfer off-site, the bank said.
Business customers can also be victims of scams, with "invoice fraud" responsible for particularly big losses.
This happens when a business receives an invoice that appears to be from a trusted trading partner, but is actually fake.
The fraudster typically says payment arrangements have changed and that the customer should pay the outstanding balance to the new account, which is operated by the fraudster.
Each business targeted loses, on average, £30,000 to this type of fraud.
The findings were released as NatWest held an event in Westminster to highlight fraud, and an initiative from National Trading Standards called Friends Against Scams.
Les Matheson, NatWest chief executive of personal and business banking, said: "We know scammers can be convincing and they work round the clock to persuade their victims to part with money.
"We have hundreds of people working 24/7 to detect and stop fraud, but it's very important that, as individuals and businesses, we know how to protect ourselves."
The government has failed to create enough jobs to match the increasing number of fresh graduates in the job market. Local and international Corporations operating in Pakistan have also shown reluctance in hiring fresh graduates. It has added to the already mounting agony of those completing their studies and relentlessly searching for a job to gain professional experience and exposure into the professional world. The minimum requirements of job experience averaging between two and three years for advertised jobs has done nothing but to deprive youngsters of the opportunities to work and earn a respectable living for themselves. It has just rendered them hopeless.
There is a need to realize that hesitation on the part of Corporations to hire fresh graduates has led to the inference that they have no faith in the potential of students which has undermined the confidence that youngsters have in themselves and their skills. I request the authorities concerned to pay heed to this serious issue as our universities are churning out thousands of graduates, unaware of the fate awaiting them in the actual job market.

Recently, local officials proclaimed to the rest of the country that any unwanted statues of Christopher Columbus should be delivered to the Town of Oyster Bay, which would proudly display the static symbols of supposed Italian Heritage.
At a press conference, Supervisor Joseph Saladino called on “radical mayors” to send Columbus statues to Massapequa, “home to one of the largest Italian-American populations in the nation,” in order to protect “the legacy of this great Italian explorer, navigator and colonizer,” because “most of us are tired of those trying to rewrite history.”
Myself an Italian-American, I've always found it strange that so many other Italians look to Columbus as the standard bearer of Italian pride. Growing up, Columbus Day always meant dinner with my grandparents—one of whom was of Sicilian descent and the other with lineage from Naples. Both were proud of their heritage—so, I understand Italian pride.
What I don't understand is the notion that acknowledging Columbus' island-hopping genocide somehow rewrites history. The ravages laid upon the indigenous inhabitants of the Caribbean by Columbus and their cohorts are well-documented, historical fact. What is not well documented by any means is proof of Columbus' Italian heritage. A few moments of simple research raises many questions about their background and all signs seem to point to them actually being from Spain or Portugal. If you find new facts about history, you are not spitefully rewriting history—you are correcting history and in the process, attempting to enlighten rigid people who often refuse to even acknowledge facts that challenge their preconceived notions.
So why do Italian-Americans cling so tightly to Columbus Day? Perhaps it's tradition or perhaps it is simply learned behavior from years of family celebrations. Or maybe its deep-seated memories of their own ancestors' plight as immigrants, when they faced many of the same prejudices experienced by today's generation of immigrants.
Regardless of why it's celebrated, it is important for all Italian-Americans to accept that some people don't want to laud Christopher Columbus or give them a day of their own. It is not because they hate Italians or want to wipe away all vestiges of “white history,” but rather it is because Columbus—who never even stepped foot in North America—represents a mangled, misinterpreted history, learned through songs and rhyming schemes.

Thousands of people were evacuated in North Carolina amid mudslides and flooding as Alberto, now a tropical depression, continued its sodden march into the American heartland on Wednesday.
The storm drove pounding rains across a swath of the nation stretching from Alabama to the Great Lakes. Much of the region was already soggy from one of the wettest Mays on record.
In North Carolina, 2,000 people were evacuated for several hours after McDowell County emergency management officials announced that the Lake Tahoma
Dam faced "imminent failure." The mandatory order, which came following localized mudslides triggered by the drenching rains, were ordered pending inspections.
An all-clear was announced about 10 hours later.
"The emergency at Lake Tahoma has been canceled," the county said in a statement. "The engineer has performed a safety inspection and determined that the evacuation order is no longer needed."

Asheville has received 13.26 inches of rain so far this month, making it the city's wettest May on record by more than 4 inches, AccuWeather reported.
"A normal May would be 3.66 inches, so you are talking about almost 10 inches more than normal," senior meteorologist Paul Walker said. "And it continues to rain."
Some spots across western portions of the Carolinas have seen more than 20 inches in just the past two weeks, the National Weather Service said. Two television station employees of WYFF in Greenville, S.C., were killed Monday when a tree fell on their vehicle as they covered the storm in Polk County, N.C.
Just to illustrate how serious the flooding is in western NC: Water swept an NCDOT tandem dump truck off the road overnight in McDowell County. Two people were rescued.

Alberto, the first named storm of a hurricane season that won't officially start until Friday, made landfall Monday west of Panama City on Florida's Gulf Coast, delivering heavy rains, surging seas and winds of 45 mph.
The winds have died down, but the rain has continued to plague much of the South. Heavy rains continued to fall in parts of Alabama on Wednesday. But better times are coming, Walker said.
"The very soupy air that has stretched from the Western Caribbean across a half to a third of the U.S. for the last week to 10 days is starting to break up," Walker said. "Things should improve in the next few days."

Their tweets have the power to shape international relations, send stock prices up — or down — and galvanize the American public.
We're watching how Donald Trump is using this platform of unfettered communication now that he's commander in chief. Here is everything Trump has tweeted since they were sworn in as 45th president of the United States. In many cases, we look at what they were reacting to and whether what they said was accurate. And, as much as possible, we'll relate what else was going on at the time. Check back for more as Trump continues to tweet.
1. Good for Alan Trammell - By any measure, conventional statistics, advanced metrics, awards, postseason success, Trammell belongs in the Baseball Hall of Fame. It was stunning my colleagues in the Baseball Writers Association of America overlooked Tram their 15 years on the ballot. Their career, conventionally and metrically, was literally identical to fellow shortstop Barry Larkins statistically. While Trammell didnt come close, Larkin, justifiably, got in the second year they were eligible. It couldnt have been market bias, either. Cincinnati is a smaller market than Detroit.
2. Good for Jack Morris - Simply put, Morris was a victim of a Sabermetrics witch hunt. Its not that the metrics community didnt have a valid point to make about how advanced math should factor into the Hall of Fame process, but how they did it and why, campaigning vehemently to keep Morris out, and trolling and intimidating writers eligible to vote, was reprehensible. A lot of it was self-serving from those simply resentful they didnt have a vote.
I agree that Wins Above Replacement is the first statistical measure that should be considered when evaluating Hall of Fame worthy candidates, but it isnt the only one. I also agree wins have traditionally been vastly overrated. But it shouldnt totally be dismissed Morris won more games than any pitcher during the 1980s. Anybody ever check out the most-winning pitchers of other decades? It does mean something.
WAR, for its many strengths, is a flawed measure in some ways, too, particularly in regard to era-to-era measurement of pitchers, and even in regard to present day evaluation because it doesnt include technology. The steroids era began much earlier than, it seems, many suspects. I heard one explanation from a voter, when Morris barely didnt get in at the end of their BWAAA eligibility, that, Its not the Hall of very good. That is pompous and disrespectful to those, who play the game. Morris is the one who went out there and did it. They won two complete games in the 84 World Series. They had a Game 7, 1-0, 10-inning shutout to clinch a World Series title 1991. Few pitchers were as successful ever. Who, when they are that close, should deny him? If somebody is close to getting inducted, I vote for them.

The game is about players. Its not a writers game or a broadcasters game or a number crunchers game or a front office game. Its about athletes performing in time and space, and then evaluating them, statistically, and otherwise.
The sad part is the blow back on the metrics community. The so-called advanced math has very much improved knowledge and understanding of baseball. Its overdue for Bill James to go in the Hall of Fame. But many fans are close-minded to it because they cant stand being talked down to, making it a hard sell for those of us who believe advanced metrics should be much more a part of the every day conversation about the sport. Thats especially true now that franchises put so much emphasis on analytics.
3. Not good for Lou Whitaker - There are three factors which make Trammells Hall credentials better than Whitakers: Trammell won the World Series MVP in 84, they had an MVP-caliber season in 87 and in retrospect should have won it, and shortstop is a more premium position than second base. But metrically, Whitaker was a better player than Trammell and all but 77 players too ever to play MLB, according to the baseball-reference.com version of WAR. They won multiple Gold Gloves, they were a Rookie of the Year and a brilliant leadoff hitter. To me, its sacrilegious Tram and Lou didnt go in together. I think there should be another statue at Comerica Park, and it should be of Tram and Lou turning a double play.
Whitaker was clearly hurt by WAR not being a widely-circulated number when they became Hall eligible in 2001. If it had been, they undoubtedly would have stayed on the ballot. I voted for them at the time, but most of the writers in Detroit didnt.
Thing is, the Sweet Lou persona is a misnomer. Whitaker is a difficult person, frankly, to like. It shouldnt matter, though, because its not a good guy award. Whitaker belongs in every bit as much as Tram, and it would be incredibly wrong if Tram got in because hes popular with media and former players, and Lou is not.
4. Good for Ted Simmons - One of the greatest athletes ever to come out of Oakland County and this state, the former Southfield High standout fell just a vote short from the Modern Era Committee. Hes a borderline Hall of Famer with a career WAR above 50. They played 20-plus years and was one of the best switch hitters ever, outperforming the average player by a wide margin during their era. Simba played a premium position, catcher. Its just that Simmons, like Whitaker, never got past their first ballot in 1994. It was wrong, and their Hall merits havent been debated nearly enough since. Glad to see they finally are.
5. Good for Bill Lajoie - Team president Jim Campbell and manager Sparky Anderson got the biggest share of credit for the 84 Tigers, and their decade-plus of tremendous success, but Lajoie was the brains behind the operation. As scouting director working with a limited budget and staff, they are the one who discovered and drafted Trammell, Morris, Whitaker, Kirk Gibson, Lance Parrish and Dan Petry. As general manager, they are one who orchestrated the spring training trade for Willie Hernandez, which put the 84 Tigers over the top. In the 1976 MLB draft, the Tigers selected Trammell in second round, Morris in the fifth round and Ozzie Smith in the seventh round.
Smith didnt sign with the Tigers. I asked Lajoie if they regretted not being able to sign Smith.
Why? We got the better player, Lajoie said.

Mathura: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said on Saturday the NCERT pattern would replace the existing syllabus in examinations conducted by the UP Board from the next academic session to bring school students at par with those in the CBSE-affiliated institutes.
It has also been decided to impart education with a blend of ancient Indian culture and modern development including technical and computer education, they said.
"Since in the existing pattern students of the Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Uttar Pradesh, find it hard to score marks, the NCERT pattern would replace it," Sharma said.
The deputy chief minister said within a year, games facility, digital black board, e-library, smart classes and wifi facility would be provided to every aided and government school.
They said, Yoga has also been introduced in physical education syllabus of the state board.
Sharma said they are committed to reduce time span of examination from present 75 days to 15 days from the next academic session.
They claimed that the exam time span in the current year has been reduced to one month.
Earlier, talking to reporters in Vrindavan, Sharma said carelessness in board examination would not be tolerated.
They said the district inspector of schools of Hardoi has been suspended for the same.
On police encounters, they asserted that police would reciprocate in the same language, if criminals are offencive.
"Gone are the days when criminals would attack police stations," Sharma asserted.
A gangster was killed and nearly two dozen criminals were arrested by police in 15 encounters in different districts of Uttar Pradesh during the past two days.
Normalcy is fast returning in Kasganj since unlawful elements are being severely dealt with, they added.
Violence erupted in Kasganj last week after 22-year-old Chandan Gupta was killed in clashes following stone-pelting on a motorcycle rally taken out to celebrate Republic Day.
New Delhi: Yes Bank on Wednesday said it has received approval from capital markets regulator Sebi to start mutual fund business.
This approval is subsequent to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) approval granted to Yes Bank to sponsor a mutual fund followed by SEBI's in-principle approval received subsequently, the bank said in a statement on Wednesday.
"Yes Asset Management (India) Limited (YAMIL) will leverage Yes Bank's Knowledge Banking expertise and relationship capital across retail, corporate and institutional investors to effectively channelise their assets in equity and debt capital markets," the bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Rana Kapoor said.
This strategic initiative will further complement Yes Bank's retail liabilities and wealth management strategy, and also allow YAMIL to build on the bank's distribution network to provide customers with a seamless investment and banking experience, Kapoor said.
The lender said it has recruited a team to establish the operations under the guidance of the Board of Directors and trustees.
Yes Asset Management will launch fund offerings across the spectrum of both debt and equity markets over the next 6-12 months.

Fresh off leading the league in rushing as a rookie, Kansas City Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt wants to be more than just a rusher.
The second-year pro has used organized team activities to focus on increasing their versatility out of the backfield.
"I'm just working on my game all around," Hunt said last week at organized team activities, via the Chiefs' official website. "I'm catching the ball more and running a lot more routes."
In addition to posting 1,327 yards rushing and eight touchdowns in 2017, Hunt proved they could be a weapon as a receiver by posting 53 catches for 455 yards and three touchdowns.
The Chiefs want to fully incorporate Hunt in the passing game and the running back embraces the idea of more touches in the open field.
"I like it," Hunt said. "It gives me the opportunity to get the ball in open space and make people miss. The toughest part is just making the play -- being able to lock in on the ball -- and to make something happen after."
The Chiefs' desire to get Hunt involved as a receiver also makes sense as the team transitions to Patrick Mahomes at quarterback.
Hunt could serve as the perfect security blanket for Mahomes in the team's short passing game, and Hunt is in the right offensive system when considering coach Andy Reid's history.
Going back to their time with the Philadelphia Eagles, Reid has often deployed versatile ball carriers, a group that includes Duce Staley, Brian Westbrook and LeSean McCoy in Philadelphia and Jamaal Charles in Kansas City.
Now, consider the career-high catches in a single season each of those rushers posted under Reid: Westbrook recorded an eye-popping 90 catches in 2007; Staley posted 63 catches in 2001; McCoy, now with the Buffalo Bills, totaled 78 receptions in 2010; and Charles totaled 70 catches in 2013, which marked Reid's first season with the Chiefs.
Given those numbers, Hunt appears primed to join a notable list of featured running backs to thrive in Reid's scheme as a receiver.
Quentin Tarantino all set to direct R-rated Star Trek film; Patrick Stewart may reprise iconic role
Speculations have been running strong about Hollywood's enfante terrible, Quentin Tarantino's ambitious plans for directing the next Star Trek movie. As reported by Deadline, Tarantino has a great idea for a Star Trek movie at Paramount and has got JJ Abrams, the director of two previous Star Trek installments, excited enough to produce the film, who is actively putting together a scripting team.
According to a report in Business Insider Tarantino has approached the studio to direct a Tarantino style Star Trek movie complete with blood, gore, violence and curse words. The director has demanded approval for an R-rated movie from the studios who are said to be on board, given the recent blockbuster success of an R-rated Deadpool.
However, the film is unlikely to be finished for at least a few years as Tarantino is currently working on Helter Skelter, their next movie on the Manson Family and their murder spree to be released by Sony in 2019.
Tarantino's films are known to be auteur-driven and they have been the writer of all their films but is not a complete stranger to the franchise bandwagon as they have worked on ER and CSI early in their career. As reported by Deadline, JJ Abrams who is currently busy directing Star Wars Episode IX, and directed the 2009-Star Trek, followed by 2013's Star Trek: Into the Darkness, has taken the reins of seeing the project through and has assembled a writers' room to start putting Tarantino's vision on paper right away.
An interesting development has also emerged which might make the fans of Star Trek explode with joy. As reported by Business Insider, Patrick Stewart has expressed interest in returning to the franchise in their iconic role as Jean-Luc Picard, if Tarantino is directing it.
In an interview to The Hollywood Reporter, the veteran actor said, “One of my dreams is to work with Tarantino. I admire their work so much, and to be in a Tarantino film would give me so much satisfaction. So, if they are going to direct something to do with Star Trek and there was the possibility of dear old Jean-Luc showing up again and doing that for Mr. Tarantino, I would embrace it.”

Panaji: The Congress party which met on Monday evening to chalk out its strategy for the Winter Session of the Assembly starting on Wednesday said it would corner the Manohar Parrikar government over the "nationalisation" of the state's rivers.
Leader of Opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar told reporters that it was decided during the CLP meeting on Monday to demand a half hour discussion on nationalisation of rivers on the floor of the House.
"We want the Goa government to pass a resolution on the floor of the House to remove all the six rivers from the National Waterways Act, 2016," Kavlekar added.
Kavlekar said that the party had also written to Union minister for shipping Nitin Gadkari requesting them to delete all the six rivers from the proposal of nationalisation.
They claimed that the nationalisation of rivers is against the sentiments of the people.
The Congress' decision came hours after Parrikar held a presentation for state MLAs, including from the opposition, and NGOs on the memorandum signed by the state with the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).
Parrikar had refuted that the state would lose control over the rivers. The CM claimed that the exercise is "not nationalisation of rivers" but "notification of rivers as that of national importance".

President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump leave MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was taken after being shot.
President Trump made a surprise visit to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, where Rep. Steve Scalise was being treated for their injuries after Wednesday's shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice.
The president and First Lady Melania Trump took two bouquets of white flowers to the hospital.
MedStar Washington said Wednesday evening that Scalise was in critical condition and would need more operations.
Scalise (R-La.), their party's No. 3 leader in the House, was among four people wounded when a rifle-wielding attacker fired on lawmakers on a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., outside Washington. The attacker was shot by police and later died.
A "Let's go Trojans!" chant broke out from one corner of the arena after USC extended its lead to seven before being drowned out by boos. The Trojans went ahead 69-60 when Stewart made a driving layup that seemed to put UCLA's season on the brink with five of its last seven games on the road.

Kroeger founded the Canadian rock band in 1995 with their brother, Chad, the group's lead singer. To date, they've released nine albums, with hits including “Rockstar,” “Photograph” and “How You Remind Me,” which was named by Nielsen Soundscan as the most-played song on U.S. radio during the 2000s.
They say opposites attract. But these days, maybe not so much.
A growing number of singles are adding a clause to their online dating profiles telling either Trump haters or Trump supporters — depending on their political preference — that they need not apply.
"This was like a dealbreaker for me," says 50-year-old Elizabeth Jagosz from the Detroit area. "If you are Trump supporter, I'm not even going to consider meeting you for coffee."
It's not just an issue of party politics, Jagosz says. It's about core values. Love, they say, cannot conquer all.
"If you don't care about a person who says you can grab women by the pussy and that's OK — I don't wanna date you if you think that behavior's OK," Jagosz says. "If that's not a dealbreaker for you, then you and I have nothing to talk about."
As another single put it in their profile, "Red hats need not apply."
But the people wearing those red hats — the ones stamped with "Make America Great Again" — have been feeling the same way.
This lack of desire from liberals and conservatives to date each other is what David Goss says prompted them to launch TrumpSingles.com.
"Yeah, it's both ways," Goss says. "You know, like a liberal doesn't want to date a Nazi. And a republican doesn't want to date, well, a whiny snowflake, and that's what they're viewing each other as."
TrumpSingles.com is a kind of safe space for Trump supporters who say they're sick of the "lefties" refusing to even give them a chance.
"[The liberals] are just repeating this left echo chamber of 'Oh, you must be a racist; oh, you must be a homophobe; oh, you must be a misogynist,' " Goss says. "They're judging the people based on who they voted for without actually getting to know them."
Helen Fisher, the chief scientific adviser to the Internet dating website Match.com, says new research from the website shows both liberals and conservatives are moving away from the center of the political spectrum.
"There's a real distinct difference that we're seeing today, and all singles are becoming more rigid in their views," they say.
The data also shows that singles are more likely now to shun those who are at the other end of the political spectrum. And liberals are more likely to spurn conservatives than the other way around.
"I think it's very natural to the human animal to bring it into the idea of 'OK, you like this person, well, you must be like that person then,' " Fisher says. "America is taking this very, very personally. No question about it."
Looking back now, it seems almost unfathomable that even two opposing campaign advisers could cross the aisle and then actually walk down the aisle as James Carville and Mary Matalin did in 1993.
As Carville famously put it once, "You can love the sinner and hate the sin."
The couple says their secret to survival and harmony at home is simply agreeing to disagree.
But today, singles seem to be saying they just can't do that.
"I mean, I wish I could just go out and tell everyone to knock it off and be cool with each other, but it's just not going to work that way," Goss says.
Their Trump Singles dating site is up to 35,000 members. LiberalHearts.com, founded by Salvatore Prano, is up to nearly 50,000.
"There's more activity now than ever," Prano says. "I knew liberals would only find comfort in each other's arms."
But there is one other option for lonely liberals. Single Joe Goldman founded MapleMatch.com, a dating site that helps Americans find Canadians "to save them from the unfathomable horror of a Trump presidency." Goldman became their own first client.
"I can't tell you the sinking feeling I felt [after the election]," they say. "That's not the country I want to live in. So why not consider places that might be more in line with my values, like Canada."
It may be better than the alternative. According to the new Match.com survey, a growing number of liberals today are simply choosing to not date at all.

New Delhi: The Public Works Department (PWD) of the Delhi government has slapped a fine of 27 lakh rupees on the Aam Aadmi Party for "unauthorised occupation" of the party office.
Sources in the government said that as on 31 May, the fine amounts to Rs 27,73,802, and it will be recovered from the party.
The fine, which is 65 times the license fee, will go on increasing if the party doesn't vacate the office, the sources said.
In April, the PWD had issued notice to Arvind Kejriwal asking them to immediately vacate the party's Rouse Avenue office that was allotted in "violation" of rules.
The party had then said that it would seek a legal recourse against this action as other political parties too have been allotted bungalows to use as office space.
The three-member Shunglu committee, formed by the then lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung, to examine over 400 files pertaining to the decisions taken by the AAP government, had pointed out "irregularities" in allotting the office.
It is to be noted that the incumbent Lieutenant Governer Anil Baijal had also directed the chief secretary to recover 97 crore rupees from the ruling AAP on advertisements using public money.
In November 2015, the AAP government had approved a policy for land allotment to state parties. The Kejriwal government then alloted a bungalow to the AAP on Rouse Avenue the following year.
The bungalow was earlier alloted to Asim Ahmed Khan, the then Delhi minister, who was sacked over graft charges.

REUTERS - Caroline Wozniacki defeated world number one Karolina Pliskova 7-5 6-7(3) 6-4 in a marathon Rogers Cup quarter-finals match in Toronto marred by four rain delays on Friday.
The delays, which all came during the first set, appeared to boost the sixth-seeded Dane, who was trailing 3-0 when the match was interrupted.
Wozniacki appeared relaxed during the breaks, which gave their time to consult with their father and longtime coach Piotr Wozniacki, before they won five straight games and ultimately took the first set.
"Almost every tournament I've played this year there has been a rain delay so at this point I just have to laugh because I feel like it is following me," they said during a courtside interview after the three hour 26 minute match.
"Every time this year when it has been raining I've had a great tournament, so I thought this must be luck."

The delays and Wozniacki's solid all-around game appeared to throw off the big-serving Pliskova, who was playing in their first tournament since becoming the world number one.

The victory marks Wozniacki's first career win against a world number one and gives the 27-year-old a 6-2 advantage in head-to-head matches with Pliskova.
Wozniacki next faces Sloane Stephens after the American beat Czech Lucie Safarova 6-2 1-6 7-5.
The remaining two quarters will be decided on Saturday.
Fourth-seeded Spaniard Garbine Muguruza is one set up against Elina Svitolina of Ukraine, winning the opener 6-4, while Simona Halep has yet to start their match against Caroline Garcia.

Three executives from Japan loom large in a cramped courtroom here — at least their photos do, mounted on a white poster board propped in front of the jury.
“They were the key decision-makers,” one attorney said during opening arguments in a lawsuit brought by a local widow against a giant Tokyo-based medical device maker.
Theresa Bigler's case is the first to go to trial in the U.S. stemming from a series of deadly superbug outbreaks across the country that were linked to contaminated medical scopes.  They are suing Olympus Corp., claiming that one of its tainted devices caused the infection that led to their husband's death in August 2013.
The Olympus executives, their attorneys say, remained silent for too long about a design flaw that hindered cleaning of these reusable scopes.
The executives, however, will not be testifying. “Each is currently under criminal investigation and would potentially risk their freedom to attend,” Olympus said in a May 22 court filing. Each executive invoked their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination in depositions late last year in Tokyo.
Richard Bigler, 57, was one of at least 35 patients in U.S. hospitals to have died since 2013 after developing infections tied to Olympus duodenoscopes — flexible, lighted tubes used to peer deep inside the body. More than 25 patients and families, from California to Pennsylvania, have sued Olympus alleging wrongful death, negligence or fraud.
Several members of Bigler's family testified this week, tearfully recalling how they thought the funny, affectionate husband, father and grandfather was beating pancreatic cancer diagnosed in late 2012. Then they contracted the infection. Their wife told jurors Wednesday that they declined so rapidly, neither they nor their four children had a chance to say goodbye.
Only months later, when they read a newspaper account of an outbreak of drug-resistant infections blamed on the scopes, did they realize what had happened and confirm it with the Seattle hospital, Virginia Mason Medical Center, said Bigler, who lives in Woodway, outside Seattle.
In California, Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and Huntington Hospital in Pasadena have reported lethal infections linked to Olympus scopes.
The Seattle case may serve as a bellwether for future litigation. It also offers a preview of the evidence federal prosecutors in New Jersey could use against Olympus in a possible criminal case. Olympus said it's cooperating with the prosecutors, who have declined to comment on their investigation.
In their opening argument in the Seattle courtroom, plaintiff's attorney David Beninger said the company put sales ahead of safety to achieve market dominance. Olympus controls 85% of the U.S. market for gastrointestinal scopes.
It's a “don't ask, don't tell policy,” Beninger said. “Keep selling, no telling.”
At Virginia Mason Medical Center, 39 people were infected from contaminated Olympus scopes and 18 of them died. The Seattle hospital said the patients who died had other underlying illnesses. Bigler, a small-business owner who loved the outdoors, had been battling pancreatic cancer when they underwent a scope procedure in 2013.
Olympus attorney Mark Anderson defended the company's scope as a medical breakthrough and cast blame on the hospital for failing to follow the company's cleaning instructions.
“Mr. Bigler missed out on life events as a result of the care they got at that hospital. … There is an issue about whether they were properly cleaning these scopes. But no, the data doesn't show that it is a product defect,” Anderson told the jury.
An investigation by federal, state and county officials concluded that Virginia Mason followed proper cleaning procedures. In an unusual strategy, the hospital and Bigler family have teamed up against Olympus at trial and both sides are seeking damages.
The hospital and the family have focused primarily on Susumu Nishina. They told the company's U.S. managers in February 2013 not to issue a broad warning to American hospitals despite reports of scope-related infections in Dutch, French and U.S. hospitals, internal emails show. Those emails, introduced as evidence in the trial, were first reported in July 2016 by Kaiser Health News and the Los Angeles Times.
Nishina and the two other executives who declined to testify, Hisao Yabe and Hiroki Moriyama, hold top roles in regulatory affairs, quality assurance or medical manufacturing. All three have declined to comment.
An expert witness called to the stand last week testified that Olympus would have realized its scopes were defective if it had sufficiently tested its cleaning and disinfection process before putting the devices on the market in 2010.
“I found there was completely inadequate premarket validation testing. It was essentially nothing in my opinion,” William Rutala, an infection-control expert at the University of North Carolina, told the jury.
Rutala has served as an expert witness for Olympus in the past during litigation involving other types of scopes. They said that the company asked them twice to testify on its behalf for this trial but that they refused because of the company's failure to ensure patient safety.
“I have been deceived. I thought there were meaningful data associated with [reprocessing] validation,” Rutala testified. “This device was intrinsically defective.”
Other documents released at the trial show that Olympus received a complaint from Virginia Mason as early as January 2011 about “patient debris” trapped inside the tip of the scope that was “extremely difficult” to remove. During the trial, a company official said there was no evidence of infection or other devices becoming contaminated so Olympus didn't report the matter to federal regulators.
Outbreaks at European and U.S. hospitals started to occur soon after.
In 2012, after an outbreak at a Dutch hospital, an independent expert hired by Olympus and the hospital concluded in a report that the scope's design could allow blood and tissue to become trapped, spreading bacteria from one patient to the next. The expert's report called on Olympus to conduct a worldwide investigation and recall all of its scopes if similar problems turned up.

Karachi-ZASHKO Entertainment announced that its debut film Na Band Na Baraati, which was slated to be released on July 6, 2018, will now hit cinemas nationwide on Eidul Fitr.
This decision was made in an effort to support the initiative taken by the federal government to strengthen the local film industry by putting a limited restriction on the screening of all Indian films during the period of Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha. Talking about this decision Zain Farooqi, the producer of NBNB said, “In view of the recent order of the federal government, Zashko Entertainment has decided to release Na Band Na Baraati on Eidul Fitr 2018, in support of the decision. Since Indian movies will now be releasing around the date of our earlier release plan, it also makes more sense to take advantage of the government's decision and release NBNB this Eid keeping in mind its genre and to make the most of the government's decision.” Na Band Na Baraati is a family comedy movie directed by Mahmood Akhtar and produced by Zain Farooqi under the banner of ZASHKO Entertainment.

Public Wi-Fi in India has the ability to capture 40 million new connected users by 2019, resulting in at least $20 billion being added to the country's GDP, a joint report by Google and global research firm Analysys Mason said on 4 July.
The report noted that public Wi-Fi could play a key role in driving ubiquitous connectivity and digital inclusion in India.
"India is a big market for the next billion users. Wi-Fi is a huge focus area and opportunity in terms of connecting these users," K. Suri, director, partnership, India, Next Billion Users, Google India, told reporters here.
"We have found that if users have free and fast access, it could make significant change to their lives and overall economic prosperity," Suri added while releasing a joint study by Google and global research firm Analysys Mason.
Google has currently partnered with RailTel and Indian Railways to offer public Wi-Fi in railway stations, covering 400 stations with about 7.6 million monthly active Wi-Fi users.
"Public Wi-Fi will connect 40 million new users to the Internet by 2019 and that would translate into tangible benefits to GDP, by around $20 billion between 2017-19 and at least $10 billion per annum thereafter," the study showed.
The report, titled "Accelerating connectivity through public Wi-Fi: Early lessons from the railway Wi-Fi project," outlined an opportunity to develop a wider connectivity ecosystem with public Wi-Fi as a key component.
"By 2019, over 100 million users will spend an extra $3 billion annually on mobile broadband and handsets because of their experience of high-speed public Wi-Fi," noted Ashwinder Sethi, Principal Consultant, Analysys Mason.
"This has direct implications on Wi-Fi ecosystem in the country, and indirect implications on the broader connectivity ecosystem, along with government, GDP and productivity," they added.
The high-speed Wi-Fi network with uncapped bandwidth of 1 Gbit/s per station provides path-breaking digital experience to existing and new users alike.
Offered as a free utility service under the brand name "RailWire", users have 30 minutes of free access to the Internet, in which they can on an average consume 350 MB of data per session.
"Currently, the public Wi-Fi has close to 8 million monthly active users, two-thirds of which are in a typically young age group. While 50 percent users access the Internet multiple times a day - 36 percent first time Wi-Fi users on the network," Suri said.
"The most usage is of online videos streaming content and watching IPL, social networking, finance. Even with multiple users getting connected at the same time, the experience is seamless and fast, with no buffering," the Google executive noted.
As part of the next billion users initiative, Google is now building on the success of RailTel project to expand the public Wi-Fi outside train stations, into Indian cities and around the world like Indonesia and Mexico, among others, Suri said.
Weisman: We're used to sitting in the editing room with Chris Long, our producing director ... they also directed the last two episodes ... and our editors, in this case Daniel Valverde and Amanda Pollack, who directed the last two episodes also. We're used to sitting with them and going over a lot, a lot of song choices, montages like that. But this being the last two episodes, especially the finale, but really, the finale, especially, we're so determined to hit a sort of level of, as close as we could come to for it that our sort of fastidiousness and perfectionism reached kind of insane levels. So we went from hours we would normally spend trying to get that right into just hours and hours and hours. And the dozens of songs we would normally listen to went into like, I mean, Joel will point this out, we listened to 100 songs for that. I don't know if we quite got there, but we probably got close, and we were in danger, I think, almost of losing our minds and driving each other and everyone else crazy. But we also knew that it would pay off.
SALEM, Ore. – Reindeer are supposed to pull Santa Claus' sleigh, but in Oregon recently, a red-suited man on a sled wound up pushing a deer.
The reverse-reality Christmas-season tale played out when a deer wandered onto a frozen golf course pond in Sunriver, Oregon, on Friday and then lost its footing.
Try as it might, it couldn't get all its legs underneath him. It skidded and slithered, and its legs buckled.

Along came firefighter Jeff “JJ” Johnston, astride a new ice-rescue sled that was as bright red as the suit they wore, and as the nose on Rudolph the reindeer, which guided Santa's sleigh one foggy Christmas Eve.
Benjamin O'Keefe, a captain in the fire department of the resort and residential community, had their camera rolling. Their video has become a sensation, garnering millions of views and picked up by broadcasters in the United States and overseas.
The young deer's hind legs began pumping, but it couldn't get up on its front legs. It was on an icy treadmill, going nowhere.
Johnston got close, spoke calming words to the deer and – slipping a bit themselves as a tried to gain traction – gently pushed it with the front of the sled to the edge of the pond. Even then, the deer needed some coaxing. It seemed to have enjoyed the slippery ride.
Johnston tapped it on the head with the back of their gloved hand, then scratched the top of its head and ears, like you'd pet a dog.
The deer tried to get onto the sled before it turned around. Pushed once more to the snowy ground, it gained solid footing and, with a wave from Johnston, scampered off, presumably to join its mates in some deer games.
“JJ was talking to it the whole time,” said Tammie Waters, office manager for the Sunriver Fire Department. “The deer played along pretty good.”
It was the inaugural rescue mission for the sled, which was purchased with a grant from Firehouse Subs, a sandwich restaurant chain, they said. They hope it never happens, but when someone falls through the ice or is stuck on thin ice, the sled will be put to use.

Social media maven Kylie Jenner and overall national treasure wasn't about to sit back and let the New Year come without one final selfie.
One final bathroom selfie, to be more precise.
The 19-year-old, whose star continues to rise despite being a celebrity since birth for the most part, can thank Instagram for that in large part.
Them use of the social media platform to share iconic images of themselves in various states of undress has been nothing short of groundbreaking.
You can count on one hand the number of people with more followers than Kylie's 80-plus million. And this is your explanation of why.
Wearing green velvet bra top and underwear on Saturday, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians staple rang in the new year in style.
“Last bathroom selfie of the year,” they wrote in the post, complete with a tongue-out emoji that sums up fans' reaction to the pic worldwide.
Gaze upon their final photo of 2016 now:
The youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner brood has taken selfies everywhere, be it in the car, in front of a mirror or in the bathroom.
The latter seems to be a personal favorite. Of hers, and ours.
Don't expect things to be any different in 2017, either. …read more

Ontario's fiscal watchdog warns the provincial budget is not balanced — due to a difference of opinion over accounting that was first raised by the auditor general last year.
The Financial Accountability Officer (FAO) said Monday that there will be a $4 billion deficit in 2017-18 even though the Liberals maintain the books are in the black.
J. David Wake said the government's “decision not to adopt the auditor general's accounting recommendations has contributed to a significant and growing gap between the fiscal outcomes projected by the FAO and the province.”
At issue is whether around $11 billion in the government co-sponsored Ontario Public Service Employees' Union Pension Plan and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan can be counted toward the bottom line at Queen's Park.
Auditor general Bonnie Lysyk and their predecessors booked the holdings as an asset starting in 2002, but they changed their mind last year.

Family and friends of tragic Hartlepool fisherman Lee Renney rode across the finishing line after completing a 150-mile coast-to-coast cycle in their memory.
A crowd of supporters welcomed the exhausted cyclists home yesterday evening.
Supporters worse special t-shirts with Lee's photo on the back for the Coast-to-Coast challenge.
Among the five exhausted riders were Lee's dad Mick Renney, 54, and brother Michael Renney, 32.
They were joined by Lee's cousin Brett Ramshaw, and friends Kayleigh McKenzie and Lee Cope.
The team set off from Whitehaven in Cumbria on Friday morning and dipped their wheels in the sea on Hartlepool's Fish Sands yesterday afternoon.
Lee died aged just 22, last September in a fishing tragedy just off Hartlepool after they were pulled overboard.
Lee Renney's dad Mick and brother Michael as they crossed the finishing line.
Their dad Mick came up with the idea of a coast-to-coast bike ride to raise money for The Fishermen's Mission which has provided support and pastoral care to Lee's family.
Mick said: “It was hard but we achieved it. The mission has supported the family through Lee's death and I wanted to do something back for them.”
Superintendent Peter Dade, mission area officer for North Shields, said: “It has been a tremendous weekend.
“It is not the easiest thing to get on a bike and cycle 150 miles, but they have done it.

Mexico is preparing for roughly 620,000 so-called Mexican “Dreamers” to be deported.
A Thursday report from El Universal documented how Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray held a meeting Tuesday at the Mexican consulate in New York with a dozen Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) beneficiaries.
Videgaray said at a press conference that Mexican employers might not be able to easily confirm work references from deported illegal immigrants. “The Mexican government can play a part here. We can verify and ceritfy these references to make the incorporation of these young people easier,” Videgaray said.
The DACA program protects nearly 800,000 illegal immigrants who arrived as minors from deportation and grants them work permits. President Trump announced that the program will end in March 2018 with beneficiaries having their status phased out.

Virat Kohli's success story as India's Test captain has extended itself yet again. The newest chapter of this saga describes the team's ruthless performance in the recently concluded series against Sri Lanka, where they whitewashed the hosts in a thumping 3-0 victory.
The best thing about this victory was that each win was greater in margin than the one preceding it.
Here's a look at the dominant results that India managed to pull off over the course of the 3-match series:
1st Test: July 26 to 30, Galle: India won by 304 runs
2nd Test: Aug 3 to 7, Colombo: India won by an innings and 53 runs
3rd Test: Aug 12 to 16, Pallekele: India won by an innings and 171 runs
An array of positives will emerge for India after this series, just as a bunch of problems will latch itself onto anyone who is involved with Sri Lankan cricket. Here is a list of the top five talking points of the series, with respect to both the participating teams:
It is always better to shock people and change their expectations than to give them exactly what they think you can do: Jonah Hill
When Hardik Pandya made their international debut in January last year, no one gave them a second glance. They seemed to be a run-of-the-mill all-rounder of the new era who bowled with an average of 30 and batted lower down the order just to belt a few into the crowd in the death overs.
They did just that for a year. They were a lightning-quick fielder, a useful fourth/fifth bowler and they knew how to swing the willow: the salient features of a modern day limited overs batsman. They performed brilliantly in the ICC Champions Trophy that was hosted in England this June, and won plaudits from cricket experts all over the world.
In spite of their heroics in one-day cricket, they aren't considered for Test matches. No one even thought of trying them out in the longest format of the game, and rightly so: they had no first-class centuries and had not shown a smidgen of the temperament that is such a pre-requisite to playing Test cricket.
The selectors decided to try them out for the Sri Lanka series though, and the youngster grabbed the (unexpected) opportunity with both hands. They performed well throughout the series, and silenced naysayers every time they set foot on the field.

They played three matches, bowled 32 overs and picked up four wickets with a bowling average of 23.75 to go with an economy of 2.96: their numbers with the ball are impressive, but they don't even come close to their exploits with the bat. They walked out to the middle just three times in the entire series and ended up scoring 178 runs at an average of 59.33 with a fifty and a perfectly-paced hundred.
The biggest positive from Pandya's successful introduction to Test cricket was how they seemed to be more at home with every passing game. There was steady improvement and an increasing sense of belief that they belonged at this level.
When they came out to bat in the first two Tests, the situation was tailor-made for him. The 23-year-old just had to come in and ameliorate on a good foundation, like they always do. The third Test, though, was a challenge for the man from Gujarat. They walked into a tricky phase of the game, when the Indian score read 322/6 and it looked like the hosts had a real chance of matching up to Kohli's men for the first time in the series.
Pandya, however, had other plans. They dug in, let the storm pass, and scored their first fifty runs in a slow, steady and seamless manner. The Sri Lankans were already deflated by then. What followed was a sheer decimation of the bowling attack, as Pandya shed their defensive skin and unleashed their natural game on the proceedings. They smashed 26 runs in an over and scored their next fifty runs at rapid pace.
The right-hander was declared the Man of the Match for the innings, and in the post-match presentation, Kohli declared that Pandya was the biggest positive for India from the series.
It can't get any better for the youngster in their maiden series, can it?

#2 The perils of Sri Lankan cricket
Dinesh Chandimal could do nothing as they watched their team go from bad to worse in the series More
Falling down is how we grow, staying down is how we die: Brian Vaszily
Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Muttiah Muralitharan: big names, bigger shoes to fill.
Sri Lanka cricket already had multiple questions to answer when they came into this series. After the conclusion of the series, these questions have only increased.
Angelo Mathews stepped down as their captain after a shocking ODI series loss against Zimbabwe at home. This declaration was immediately followed by Graham Ford deciding to resign as the head coach of the team.
Confusion hung in the air. There were questions everywhere and on everyone's lips.
India might be the World No. 1 Test side right now, but that doesn't make them unconquerable. Sri Lanka made them seem unconquerable though.
Not once in the entire series did India look like losing, very rarely were they not in an unquestionably winning position. Sri Lanka couldn't tame them with the ball. They couldn't scare them with the bat. They couldn't irk them in the field. It looked like the air, along with the fighting spirit, was sucked out of the hosts completely.
The struggle of Sri Lankan cricket is reflected in their ODI series loss to Zimbabwe last month and their failure to qualify for the 2019 World Cup just yet. It will take a while before they get back to their glory, but the cricketing world would like to see the SLCB as well as its players take meaningful steps in the right direction over the next couple of years.

#3 India's opening pair conundrum: A welcome problem for India
KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Murali Vijay - How will Kohli choose? More
I like to push characters to extremes so that they have to make really tough decisions and there is no life more extreme than that of an athlete: Chris Cleave
Let us look at the batsmen Kohli has to choose from the next time India dons the white jersey again:
Shikhar Dhawan: Man of the Series vs Sri Lanka, 358 runs in four innings, including two big hundreds.
KL Rahul: First Indian to score seven back-to-back half centuries in Test cricket, the ultimate comeback master
Murali Vijay: One of India's top three Test batsmen, an experienced campaigner who has proven themselves in stern overseas conditions
This is a conundrum that will drill a hole in the Indian skipper's head, but it definitely makes for a headache they would love to have. They have multiple options to choose from, and there is no doubting each one's talent, consistency or temperament.
Vijay was ruled out of the Sri Lanka series due to a wrist injury, which in turn helped Dhawan make a comeback into the Test fold. The left-handed batsman grabbed the opportunity with both hands and played two thumping innings against the tired-and-tattered Sri Lankan bowlers.
Rahul also made their comeback to the side after a long-standing injury layoff and did not disappoint in the slightest. They went about their business at the top of the innings, took some excellent catches at backward short-leg and 'dabbed' their way to another successful comeback story.
Kohli will now have to pick two of the three players. The final decision, no matter what it is, will be unfair on the batsman who misses out. Another way out for Kohli is to accommodate all three of them and drop a middle-order player from the side. That, however, is unlikelier than the first option, considering the impeccable form Ajinkya Rahane and Hardik Pandya have been in.
The Indian skipper, however, will take this problem in a split-second over Sri Lanka's crisis, where they have the spots but not the right players to fill them with!
​
#4 Sri Lanka's endless captaincy woes
Sri Lanka's bad form extends to their inconsistent leadership More
Leadership is a choice, not a position: Stephen Covey
In the current Sri Lankan setup, leadership seems more of a burden than a privilege. Captains are stepping down, captains are getting injured and captains are confused.
Mathews stepped down after the Zimbabwe series and Chandimal was announced as the Test captain just a couple of weeks after being dropped from the ODI squad. Then Chandimal contracted pneumonia and was ruled out of the first Test against Sri Lanka. Suddenly, Rangana Herath was the new Test captain. Chandimal's maiden Test as a skipper came in the second game of the series, while Herath was ruled out of the third match courtesy back pain.
Phew.
It is a wonder they knew who to send to the middle for the toss every time, isn't it?
A ship that doesn't have a steady captain can't ever dream of sailing steadily. Herath and Chandimal could not shoulder the additional responsibility. They failed to deliver tactically as well as emotionally, and could not inspire their men to punch above their weight. The side crumpled under the inconsistent, putrid and at times, tardy leadership.
​
#5 The shimmering Shami show
Shami was at their deadly best throughout the series More
Any human anywhere will blossom in a hundred unexpected talents and capacities, simply by being given the opportunity to do so: Doris Lessing
We are always so focused with those holding the willow that we sometimes forget that it's the 20 wickets from those with the ball that eventually win you the Test series.
Mohammed Shami outdid themselves on this tour and that too on dead, non-seaming and dry pitches. They stood out throughout the series and not only justified their place in the side, but stamped their authority all over it.
The man from Uttar Pradesh played in all three matches of the series and picked up 10 wickets at an incredible bowling average, giving away just 2.90 runs per over. They might not have a fifer to show from this series, but they showed why they are the best pacer India have in the longest format of the game.
They banged the ball in. They bowled at an average speed of over 140 kmph. They pressurized the batsmen. They created opportunities. They swung the ball. They disturbed the woodwork. They claimed wickets.
In their free time, they put smiles on the faces of young ball boys.
The 27-year-old's accuracy has never been questioned, but this series showed that they can breathe fire through some serious pace. They will be India's frontline bowler in the overseas tours to come and hopefully they stay injury-free through the same.

ST GALLEN-Mario Balotelli got new Italy coach Roberto Mancini off to a winning start by scoring the opener in a 2-1 win over Saudi Arabia in a pre-World Cup friendly in Saint Gallen on Monday.
Saudi Arabia face hosts Russia in the opening match of the tournament on June 14 while four-time champions Italy stay home following their failure to qualify for the first time in 60 years. Made the scapegoat for Italy's first-round exit from the 2014 World Cup, Balotelli's four-year Azzurri hiatus ended when they were recalled by Mancini, appointed six months after Italy's shock failure to qualify for Russia following a playoff defeat to Sweden.
It took the 27-year-old Nice striker just 21 minutes to get on the scoreboard with their first goal for Italy since netting the winner against England at the 2014 World Cup. Substitute Andrea Belotti added a second midway through the second half before Yahya Al-Shehri pulled one back for the Saudis following Italian defensive blunders. "I'm satisfied with the first half-performance. The difficulties of the second half were down to tiredness due to the extra fitness training we've been doing over the last few days," said Mancini.
"Saudi Arabia are approaching peak form because they are going to the World Cup. I wasn't angry about the goal we conceded. I thought it was down to fatigue."
Mancini said Balotelli's performance was "pretty good". "Balotelli can do better, much better, but I thought they did pretty good in the first half. They scored a goal, which is important for a striker, but of course they can do more."
Italy have dropped to their lowest ever world ranking of 20th, but were in control against the 67th-ranked Saudis. Mancini opted for a 4-3-3 formation with Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal and Sassuolo winger Matteo Politano handed their full debut.
Balotelli came out firing early with the Nice striker heading just wide off a Leonardo Bonucci cross. They finally found a way through with a low drive under the outstretched arms of Saudi goalkeeper Mohammed Al Owais for their 14th goal in 34 appearances.
Napoli winger Lorenzo Insigne nearly added a second minutes later after picking up a pin perfect cross but defender Yasir Al Shahrani blocked. An Alessio Romagnoli bicycle kick flew just wide with Domenico Criscito rattling the the crossbar. Both Mancini and Saudi coach Juan Antonio Pizzi made substitutions in the second half with Balotelli making way for Belotti after 58 minutes.
And the 24-year-old Torino striker scored the second when they turned in a rebound ten minutes later. Al-Shehri pulled Saudi Arabia back into the game four minutes later taking advantage of defensive error by Davide Zappacosta.
Leganes winger Al-Shehri picked up a Salem Al Dawsari flick and fired past the outrushing Donnarumma into an empty net. After Donnarumma denied Fahad Al Muwallad a late equaliser Italy held on for their first win since their 1-0 World Cup qualifier away to Albania on October 9, which was followed by two draws and two defeats.
"In the second half we held our own against one of the best teams in the world," said Saudi coach Pizzi. "Although they are not in the World Cup, they have a great coach, an unparalleled history."
Belotti added: "The failure to reach the World Cup is something that continues to hurt, it's an open wound. "We must start again and build our self-confidence, which I think is what we saw tonight."
Italy plays two more friendlies, against France on June 1 in Nice and the Netherlands on June 4 in Turin. The Saudis play two more warm-up games, against Peru on June 3 and Germany on June 8 before kicking off their World Cup campaign.

Spiders could soon be invading your home to get out of the cold.
Millions of creepy crawlies will be using cracks and crevices to enter our houses looking for a mate and, with a warm summer behind us, there's expected to be even more of them than usual thanks to there being more flies for them to feed on.
With more than 650 different species of spiders in the UK, it can be hard to spot the ones which can leave a nasty bite.
Though they are all largely harmless and unlikely to cause you any bother, 12 of these species have enough venom to hurt a human.
Here's a list of ten of the most common spiders you could be seeing in your home over the next few weeks, including if they pack a painful bite.
1. Missing sector orb web spider
Also known as Zygiella x-notata, this spider is named because it spins an orb web with one full sector missing.
With a size of up to 15mm, this arachnid is relatively small and is common around Britain's houses and gardens.
The spider, which is not harmful to humans, can be distinguished by its pale body and legs, with silvery-grey markings on its abdomen.
Usually seen indoors in the autumn and winter months, this spider prefers warmth and is most common in areas around Leicestershire and Rutland.
How big are they? Up to 15mm
Are they harmful? No, not at all
2. Giant house spider
Measuring about 120mm, this critter is most common in the autumn months when the males leave their webs in search of females.
Often the spider you're likely to find in the bath, they can run extremely fast, but only for a limited length of time before they have to stop to recover from their exhaustion.
These large spiders build sheet like webs and may be found in garages, sheds, attics and cavity walls where they are less likely to be disturbed.
Giant house spiders do possess a potent venom and can bite, but they do not usually pose a threat to humans.
How big are they? Big - 120mm
Are they harmful? Potentially, yes - but they're not at all aggressive
3. Daddy long legs spider
Unlike the hairy giant house spiders, these creepy crawlies have small grey bodies and long, thin legs.
Although they can vary in size, the pholcus phalangioides (to give them their scientific name) can potentially measure up to 45mm.
Urban myths exist that suggest the daddy long legs spider contains the most potent venom but that their fangs aren't strong enough to penetrate human skin.
Reports on research into this theory suggests that the spiders can bite - but the venom will only deliver a brief mild burning sensation, if anything at all.
How big are they? Up to 45mm
Are they harmful? No, not really
4. Lace web spider
Usually found on outdoor walls and fencing, these spiders will retreat inside in the autumn months to find a mate.
Heavy rainfall can also force these spiders into the house, usually because they have been flooded out of their own home.
They generally grow to a size of around 20mm and are brown with yellow markings on the abdomen.
Be on your guard when you see one of these spiders, as they have been known to bite people in recent years.
Bites are reported to be painful but the symptoms usually just consist of localised swelling for around 12 hours.
How big are they? 20mm
Are they harmful? Yes - if they bite, you'll know about it
5. Zebra jumping spider
These eight-legged creatures are small, reaching a size of just 8mm.
Recognisable from their distinctive white and black markings, the move in a jerky ‘stop, start' motion.
These spiders are usually seen from spring through to autumn and can be found on external walls, as well as indoors where they will enter through open doors and windows.
They are more likely to flee from humans than attack them, but they can bite - although the venom is not considered medically threatening.
How big are they? Small - just 8mm
Are they harmful? No
6. False widow spider
Cited as Britain's most venomous spider the false widow already has a bad reputation.
The species, also known as steatoda nobilis, usually has an overall size of 20mm and is characterised by a dark brown colour and a bulbous abdomen.
Adult female false widow spiders are known to have bitten humans, although they are not usually aggressive and attacks on people are rare and there are no reported UK deaths.
Symptoms of a bite can range from a numb sensation to severe swelling and discomfort.
In serious cases there can be various levels of burning or chest pains, which will depend on the amount of venom injected.
How big are they? 20mm
Are they harmful? In a word, yes
7. Cardinal spider
The cardinal spider is the largest spider in the UK, growing to an overall length of 14cm in some cases.
Also known as tegenaria parietina, it is known as the cardinal spider in Britain because of the legend that Cardinal Thomas Woolsey was terrified by this species at Hampton Court back in the 16th century.
Although they are mainly thought to be harmless to humans, these arachnids get a bad reputation because of their huge size, incredible speed and their nocturnal habits.
Bites from these spiders are rare, and painless.
How big are they? Very - 14cm
Are they harmful? No, they look much scarier than they actually are
8. Money spider
From the Britain's biggest to the smallest, money spiders grow no more than 5mm long, with their leg span just 2mm.
They get their name from an old superstition that if one got stuck in your hair, it would bring you good luck and increased wealth.
The money spider weaves hammock shaped webs and bites its prey to paralyse it - before wrapping it in silk and eating it.
The fangs on this spider are not anywhere near big enough to penetrate human skin.
How big are they? Tiny - 2mm
Are they harmful? No, not at all
9. Tube web spider
As you might expect, this spider is aptly named because of the tube-shaped web it spins to catch its prey.
They are often found in cracks in buildings which they will cover with silk lines while they wait in the entrance.
Originally a species from the Mediterranean regions, it can now be found in British towns including Bristol, Cornwall, Gloucester, Dover, Southampton and Sheffield, amongst others.
This spider does bite and the pain has been compared to a deep injection with the sensation lasting for several hours. Despite this, the bites do not appear to have any lasting effects.
How big are they? Up to 22mm
Are they harmful? Kind of - their bite might hurt, but the pain won't last
10. Cupboard spider
Closely related to the false black widow, the steatoda grossa is often mistaken because of its dark colour and similarly bulbous abdomen.
It usually grows to approximately 10mm in length and its appearance can vary slightly from purple to brown to black.
The female can lay egg sacs at least three times a year which typically contain between 40 and 100 eggs.
They have been known to bite humans, but are not usually aggressive.
Although injuries are minor, symptoms can include blistering and generally feeling unwell - which can last a couple of days.
How big are they? Up to 12mm
Are they harmful? A bit - they don't bite often, but when they do it hurts
New Delhi: Seeking to allay concerns of depositors over provisions of a draft law, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Monday said the government will fully protect public deposits in financial institutions even as they hinted at openness to changes in the proposed FRDI Bill.
Jaitley said the government's massive Rs 2.11 lakh crore capital infusion plan in banks was to strengthen banks and there was no question of any lender failing. If any such situation arises, the government will "fully protect" the deposits made by customers, the finance minister said here adding that "the government is very clear about it".
Jaitley made the comment to allay concerns with regard to a provision in the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance (FRDI) Bill, 2017, first introduced in the Lok Sabha in August this year and currently undergoing scrutiny by a joint parliamentary committee. The so-called "bail-in" clause in the draft legislation has been commented upon by experts as of bringing potential harm to deposits, in the form of savings accounts.
"The Bill is before the joint committee of Parliament. Whatever are the recommendations of the committee, the government will consider," they said. They said rumours are being spread about the provisions of the bill. "The government has already clarified and said it is committed to strengthen PSU banks and financial institutions. About Rs 2.11 lakh crore is being pumped in to strengthen the public sector banks."
The FRDI Bill proposes to create a framework for overseeing financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, non-banking financial services (NBFC) companies and stock exchanges in case of insolvency.
The 'Resolution Corporation', proposed in the draft bill, would look after the process and prevent the banks from going bankrupt. It would do this by "writing down of the liabilities", a phrase some have interpreted as a "bail in".
The draft bill empowers Resolution Corporation to cancel the liability of a failing bank or convert the nature of the liability. It does not specify deposit insurance amount. At present, all deposits up to Rs 1 lakh are protected under the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation Act that is sought to be repealed by this bill.
Adam's friends, myself included, have urged Adam to quit Tufts Community Union (TCU) Senate many times. It's sometimes done as a joke to see how he'll react. Other times, it's out of selfishness because we want to spend more time with him. The demand is typically made in awe after watching them devote immense amounts of time to this organization. Over the past three years, I've watched Adam devote countless hours of their time and effort to TCU Senate. When they first told me that they were running for president, I was not the slightest bit surprised. For Adam, the position seems to be the natural culmination of three years of devoted service, both as Senator and Parliamentarian, to the student body.
I met Adam during my first week of college. The first thing I noticed was their endless compassion. During my first weekend on campus, my friend from high school decided to visit me. Naturally, they got lost in Boston while trying to make their way to Tufts. Despite not knowing me for more than a couple of days, Adam came with me into Boston on a Friday night to help me find my friend. Since that first week of meeting him, Adam has always gone out of their way to help their friends in need. Whether it's assisting me in setting up IKEA furniture or consoling me after the Seahawks didn't make the NFL playoffs, Adam has always been there for me.
The same can be said for their work on TCU Senate. Adam puts their heart and soul into every project that they have been a part of. Their love for Late Night Carm Study is admirable; they go out of their way to make sure there are as many snacks as possible for stressed-out students during finals week. Adam even worked tirelessly to put something as basic as a water fountain in Tilton Hall after hearing complaints from others in their dorm. As the Parliamentarian for the past two years, Adam has been put in some difficult positions as controversial resolutions have been proposed. Regardless of all of the stress and confrontation he's faced, Adam's devotion to TCU Senate and helping to improve our school have always held steadfast.
Being friends with Adam is such a gift.  They are kind, considerate and compassionate. Above all, they will always make time for what their friends and peers need from him. They have done it for me as a friend and the Tufts student body as a representative for the past three years. They want nothing more than to be able to help improve Tufts and everyone's experience here, and I hope for the benefit of our university that they get the opportunity to do that as TCU President.
The City Beautiful is one of the most dangerous places in the US to be a pedestrian. A study by the group Smart Growth America which analyzed data from 2005 to 2014 put Orlando Kissimmee and Sanford 3rd on the list of most dangerous metro areas for pedestrians. Orlando's new transportation director, Billy Hattaway, wants to make the roads safer for pedestrians.
Hattaway says the city's transportation department – which includes planning, engineering, parking and the red light camera program- was split up during the recession to save money.
Hattaway, who's a veteran of the Florida Department of Transportation, says improving safety for cyclists and pedestrians is just one of their goals for Orlando's reunited transportation department.
Darren Rovell says Steph Curry's disagreement with CEO Kevin Plank's support of President Donald Trump is "not real tension" and Curry is not considering leaving Under Armour. (1:37)
The CEO of Baltimore-based sports apparel company Under Armour responded Wednesday to criticism they received after calling President Donald Trump "an asset to the country."
Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry was among celebrities the company sponsors to voice concerns about Kevin Plank's praise of Trump, jokingly telling The Mercury News last Wednesday that they agreed -- if you remove "the ET from asset."
In an open letter to Baltimore published as a full-page advertisement in The Baltimore Sun, Plank wrote that they wanted to clarify what values they and their company stand for.
Read: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank's letter to Baltimore in response to criticism over Trump comments. https://t.co/EoKZAJVSFf — The Baltimore Sun (@baltimoresun) February 15, 2017
"In a business television interview last week, I answered a question with a choice of words that did not accurately reflect my intent,'' they wrote referring to an interview on CNBC on Feb. 7.
The company stands for equal rights and job creation and believes "immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America,'' Plank wrote. Also, the company opposes the president's travel ban.
"With an anticipated new executive order on immigration set to come out, we will join a coalition of companies in opposition to any new actions that negatively impact our team, their families or our community,'' they said.
Editor's Picks Curry against Under Armour CEO's Trump take Asked if they would consider leaving Under Armour if they didn't like its direction, Stephen Curry said: "There is no platform I wouldn't jump off if it wasn't in line with who I am."
Curry is one of Under Armour's most high-profile spokespersons, with a deal that pays them at least $15 million annually -- and gives them a stake in the shoe and apparel company through 2024.
Curry's business last year for Under Armour was worth $200 million, sources told ESPN's Darren Rovell, but some estimates of their value to the company are much higher.
They told the Mercury News that Under Armour working with Trump doesn't affect their deal with the company and that they are more concerned about it adopting Trump's values.
Plank also released a statement last Wednesday clarifying their comments and Curry said based on conversations they had with Plank last week they would continue to stand behind the company.

The findings of investigation into the plane crash that killed four set to be released.
The wreckage of a Cessna Citation which crashed on October 13, 2016, is seen in the woods near Lake Country, B.C., in this October 15, 2016, Transportation Safety Board handout image. The aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff, killing the pilot and all three passengers aboard, including the former Alberta Premier Jim Prentice. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO-TSB,
The investigation into the 2016 plane crash that killed four passengers, including former Alberta premier Jim Prentice, after it departed Kelowna has been completed and results will be announced later this week.
The Transportation Safety Board will hold a news conference Thursday to release its investigation report on the Oct. 13 2016 crash of the Cessna Citation 500, and the Capital News will report on its findings.
At the time of the crash RCMP Cpl. Dan Moskaluk said the Cessna Citation private business aircraft was owned by Norjet, a Calgary-based firm, and had departed Kelowna International Airport en route to Springbank, outside of Calgary.
“I know that heavy rain was felt across the Okanagan Valley but difficult to say if that was an issue in this case,” Moskaluk said.
The Transportation Safety Board released a statement at the time also, saying that there were no emergency calls or signals from the high impact crash that scattered debris over a vast space.

RCMP, with the help of a police dog, were able to get to the scene just before midnight, and received assistance from local search and rescue volunteers.
“It's a complex scene right now and it will take some time for the investigation of the crash site to be completed,” Moskaluk said.
“The terrain is hilly and densely forested, but we were able to access the site from a nearby forest service road.”
The site of the crash was northeast of Winfield, about four kms north of Beaver Lake Road and about 18 kms north of Kelowna.

Kelowna RCMP and Lake Country RCMP detachments were alerted by the Surrey Air Traffic Control Centre that they had lost contact with a Citation jet shortly after its takeoff from Kelowna airport.
Also onboard that night were Sheldon Reid, a shareholder in Norjet, the owner of the Cessna Citation aircraft that crashed, and Jim Kruk, associated with the 83 ‘Lynx' air cadet squadron based out of Airdrie, a rural community north of Calgary, and Calgary optometrist Kenneth Gellatly, whose son was married to Prentice's daughter.
The men were flying home to Calgary from a late-season golf game in Kelowna when the crash occurred.

The Prelim Breakout Star is a once per event article that helps fans get to know those who will be entertaining them from the undercard. The intention of the article is not to bring attention to the most talented fighter on the preliminary card, but rather one that the common fan may have overlooked or underestimated.
Every Ultimate Fighter Finale card is exciting because fans of the show get to see the potential of their favorites from the show with a full camp. One that will surely benefit from the extended training period is our focus for this card.
Luis Pena
Nickname – Violent Bob Ross
Affiliation – American Kickboxing Academy
From – Naples, Italy
Height – 6'3″
Weight – 155 lbs (Lightweight)
Record – 4-0 (0-0 UFC)
What makes them impressive
All of their last three fights have been finished by submission, but what is more impressive is that striking is really the strongest part of their game. Being as tall as they are in this division gives them an inherent striking advantage, but they also use it well. Particularly their use of knees makes it difficult for any opponent to feel comfortable on the inside with him, which is almost necessary to beat someone with that much of a height advantage.
Why they have been overlooked
“Violent Bob Ross” got a bit of a raw deal on The Ultimate Fighter. After winning their first fight they found out their foot was broken and would be out for the remainder of the competition. As a result, fans were robbed of the ability to see more of what they have (and I'd suggest looking up any of their four fights to see just what you are missing).
What makes this a good match-up
Richie Smullen had a similar tough deal on the show. Their weight cut went badly, making them bow out of their only fight. However, those that have seen them know he's a dangerous submission artist out of Ireland with a handful of leg lock finishes in their career. This plays right into Pena's hands because firstly, he'll have to get in on Pena to get them down, which is never an easy move. Secondly, he'll have to take out a guy with three straight subs on their record. Not an easy task.

“Reading what you hate helps you refine what it is you value, whether it's a style, a story line or an argument. Because books are long-form, they require more of the writer and the reader than a talk show or Facebook link. You can finish watching a movie in two hours and forget about it; not so a novel. Sticking it out for 300 pages means immersing yourself in another person's world and discovering how it feels. That's part of what makes books you despise so hard to dismiss. Rather than toss the book aside, turn to the next page and wrestle with its ideas. What about them makes you so uncomfortable?”

What's going on with the Tuesday Night Farmers Market?
Posted on April 23, 2018 by Fred Allebach
For 2018, music will always be on the horseshoe lawn in front of the fountain. The Jazz Society will be in the Grinstead amphitheater on 2nd Tuesdays, in June, July, August, and September. On Jazz Tuesdays, there will still be small solo or duo acoustic acts in front of the fountain. Music is being presented and coordinated by Gerard and Mary Serafini.
All vendors, including food trucks, will be at the Market every week! There is no 2nd and 4th Tuesday arrangement. In addition, all stalls will be occupied in front, on the sides, and behind City Hall every week. This is a total of 85 stalls, and, since some vendors use more than one stall, about 55 vendors.
Costs for the Market, including Plaza rent, Sheriff's security, garbage and recycling, etc., have all been steadily increasing. In order to keep vendor stall fees reasonable and fair for local farmers and small business people, the Market organization finds it must reach out to the community for financial support to augment the annual budget. One way of reaching out is by holding a first-ever fundraising event the weekend before the Market's opening day. The “First Annual Farmers Market Funny Fest” will be at the Vintage House on Saturday, April 28th starting at 6pm. It's a comedy show with three nationally-known comedians, and it will also feature silent auction and raffle items, including many wonderful things from the Market's own vendors. The event should be a lot of fun, and the Market is looking forward to seeing fans come out in support. Here's a link to buy tickets on the Market's website homepage, www.SonomaPlazaMarket.org.
For the past several years, local businesses have sponsored the Market. This year the sponsorship program has been expanded to allow individuals and families to contribute to the Market as Friends of, and Patrons. Business sponsorships are offered as well, and for smaller contributions, individuals and families can support the Market and receive gifts and benefits. More details will be posted on the Market website soon.
This year marks a new beginning of sorts for the Market. The Market has signed a new two-year contract with the City, and has been working very closely over the last year with City Manager Cathy Capriola and city Special Events Manager Lisa Janson. An exciting new partnership is being forged.
The redesigned annual Market poster will feature the artwork of the Grand Prize Winner of the 2018 Poster Art Contest. The Grand Prize, and 1st and 2nd Place prize-winning artworks will be offered in silent auction at the Funny Fest, where the Market will unveil the new 2018 Poster. The 2018 Poster will be offered for sale every Tuesday at the Manager's Table on the west side of City Hall.
Market managers are very excited about the 2018 season and the future of the Market. Come on out an enjoy Sonoma's premier local event!
Istanbul: The Islamic State jihadist group claimed the shooting rampage inside a glamorous Istanbul nightclub on New Year's night that killed 39 people, as police hunted the attacker who remains on the run. With foreigners making up the majority of those killed in yesterday's attack, families were due to reclaim the bodies of more than two dozen non-Turkish and mainly Arab victims.
The shooting, which unleashed scenes of carnage and panic among party-goers at one of Istanbul's swankiest venues, took place just 75 minutes into 2017 after a bloody year in Turkey in which hundreds of people were killed in violence blamed on both IS jihadists and Kurdish militants. In a statement circulated on social media, the jihadist group said one of the “soldiers of the caliphate” had carried out the attack on the Reina nightclub.
It accused Turkey, a majority-Muslim country, of being a servant of Christians, in a possible reference to Ankara's alliance with the international coalition fighting IS in neighbouring Syria and Iraq. The statement said the assault was in response to Turkey's military intervention against IS in war-ravaged Syria. Turkish troops are pressing on with a four-month incursion in Syria to oust IS jihadists and Kurdish militants from the border area.
In the last few weeks, the forces have encountered fierce opposition from the jihadists around the town of Al-Bab. The army said Turkish war planes launched new air strikes around Al Bab. Arriving by taxi at the plush Reina nightclub on the shores of the Bosphorus, the gunman produced a weapon, reportedly a Kalashnikov, and shot dead a police officer and civilian at the entrance.
According to the Hurriyet daily, the gunman then fired off four magazines containing a total of 120 bullets around the club, as terrified guests flung themselves into the freezing waters of the Bosphorus in panic. But after changing clothes, the gunman left the nightclub in the ensuing chaos and has managed to evade security forces. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said Sunday that intense efforts were under way to find the gunman, and expressed hope that they would be captured soon. Late Sunday, police rushed to Istanbul's Kurucesme district after a tip-off but the operation did not produce any arrest.
“The danger continues,” wrote columnist Abdulkadir Selvi in Hurriyet. “So long as this terrorist is not seized we do not know when and where a massacre could take place.” Hurriyet said investigators believe the attacker may be from the Central Asian states of Kyrgyzstan or Uzbekistan. Investigators also consider it possible that the attacker is linked to the same cell that in June carried out a triple suicide bombing and gun attack at Istanbul's Ataturk airport blamed on IS that left 47 people dead, the paper added.
Around the same time, mandatory evacuation orders were expanded to include the area west of Highway 16 to Berryessa Knoxville Road from Old Country Road 40 down to Country Road 53 in Yolo and Napa counties.

Mexican and U.S. brewers have reinvented U.S. President Donald Trump as a gun-slinging mariachi folk musician to promote a new beer celebrating cross-border cooperation.
The label of the new Amigous Cerveza craft beer, showing a frowning Trump in a sombrero, their trousers held up with a swastika belt buckle, mocks their divisive campaign rhetoric against Mexico and their pledge to build a border wall.
WATCH: Donald Trump crashes New Jersey wedding
The rear label declares that the 71-year-old New Yorker belongs “in a mad house, not the White House.”
“We knew that a Trump label was going to be controversial, but it's been selling extremely fast,” said Luis Enrique de la Reguera, chief executive of brewery Casa Cervecera Cru Cru.
Launched in May, the beer that misspells “amigo” to poke fun at a bad American pronunciation of the Spanish word for friend, surprised its creators. The original batch of 1,200 bottles and 400 liters on tap sold out in the very first week.

A kind of New England Indian Pale with a dash of mango, the beer was dreamt up by Cru Cru, Mexican partner Error de Diciembre and Epic Brewing of the United States shortly before Trump‘s election victory on Nov. 8.
Trump sparked dismay in Mexico by saying the country was sending rapists and drug runners across the border, and angered business groups by threatening to tear up a joint trade deal.

Ahmedabad: Patidar quota agitation spearhead Hardik Patel on Monday took out a roadshow in Ahmedabad, despite police denying permission for it, and attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for linking the elections to Pakistan, which they said was a "lie".
They also criticised the BJP for talking about "Ram Mandir, Jammu and Kashmir, and Pakistan" during electioneering instead of the future of the local youth.
The Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) convener also called upon people from different communities to come together to defeat the "arrogant BJP".
Earlier in the day, Hardik took out the 15-km-long roadshow from Bopal area of Ahmedabad.
Hundreds of their supporters took out the rally on motorcycles and four-wheelers through the main city area, even as the police said they will take legal action against Patel for holding the roadshow without permission.
Their supporters, especially youths from the Patidar community, gathered at various places on the way to greet them and express their support.
The roadshow culminated in Nikol locality where they addressed a public meeting.
"(Modi said) people came from Pakistan and discussed Gujarat elections. Stop telling lies. What has Pakistan to do with Gujarat elections? People who talked about development have again gone back to talk about Ram Mandir, terrorism, Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, but did you see them talk about development?" Patel told a gathering at Nikol.
Addressing a rally in Palanpur on Sunday, Modi had claimed that leaders of the Congress had held a secret meeting with current and former Pakistani dignitaries a day ahead of Mani Shankar Aiyar's "neech" jibe against him.
They also claimed there was an attempt by Pakistan to interfere in the Gujarat polls.
The PAAS has extended support to the Congress in the polls on the assurance of quota given by the Rahul Gandhi-led party if it forms government.
"They (BJP) do not talk about how to create jobs for youths, all they do is talk about Hindu-Muslims, India- Pakistan, to divert people's attention and speak lies," Patel claimed.
"Saheb" (Modi) has been making long speeches but did not utter a word about the condition of the people here or about the plight of diamond traders who are affected by the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax," they claimed.
Nikol area has a number of diamond polishing units.
Earlier, Ahmedabad Police Commissioner AK Singh said that the police had not allowed Hardik to hold the roadshow in the city.
"We had not given permission to Hardik Patel to hold the roadshow in Ahmedabad, but from the kind of rally that has been taken out by their supporters in the city area, we do see that it is violation of the condition and we will take legal action," Singh said.
Continuing their diatribe against Modi, Patel claimed that the prime minister had said that they did not need Patidars to win elections.
"I had thought that 'saheb' will talk about how they can help Patidars, or how to improve the future of jobless youth. I thought they will visit the houses of the Patidar youths who were killed (in 2015 agitation) to express condolences and give them assurance.
"But no. They (Modi) says they do not need Patidars to win elections (as) they will get the support of OBCs, SCs, and STs, but this is not the fight of Patidars alone but for the whole of Gujarat," the quota spearhead claimed.
Patel told the gathering that they didn't care whether the BJP wins or loses the elections.
"All I want to tell you is that make sure that our votes are meant for the the future of our kids," they said.
They said all communities, including Patidars, have raised their voice in unison saying that they wanted change not only in Gujarat but in the entire country.
"I call upon you to bring that change," Patel said.
They urged the audience to understand the "value of their votes".
"We will have to understand this...time is changing...people will not get education, our future is bleak, we will have to spend lakhs on education. Inflation is skyrocketing, while jobs are hard to come by," Patel said.
Taking a dig at the BJP, they said development did not mean only nice roads but it meant that everybody gets free education and jobs with honesty so one can live with pride.
"You have to show the power of the people. Hardik Patel is nothing and can only fight when you are behind me. It is not just reservation, but I'm here to fight even for diamond workers and traders," they said.
Appealing to Patidars, Patel said it would be "betrayal" for the community if they vote for the BJP.
"I'm not here to ask you to give vote to this or that party, but it will be a betrayal to your community if you vote for the BJP. Make them realise once what it means to commit atrocities on people," they said.
Patel asked people to take a pledge against voting for the BJP "because they committed atrocities on our people and killed innocents".
"I will not give my precious and pure vote (to the BJP). On December 14, at 11 am, I will vote to defeat the arrogant government and for the victory of the six crore Gujaratis," they said.
The second and final phase of the high-stake Gujarat elections is scheduled to be held on 14 December.
You know what “hurts policing efforts”? You know what “undermines confidence in the police”? A police force that is not openly accountable to the people it serves. A police force where investigations into possible or alleged misconduct are kept secret. A system in which police themselves participate in a de facto “no snitching” code and do not co-operate with investigations of possible or alleged crimes.
A law halted by the new Tory government would have been a step toward restoring and strengthening trust and respect in Ontario police, writes Edward Keenan. ( Andrew Lahodynskyj / Toronto Star file photo )
Those are the kinds of problems that will help make the public sour on police, and therefore make it harder for the police to do their jobs. Those were the problems, among others, that provincial Bill 175, parts of which were supposed to come into force June 30, was meant to address. But hold on. Here comes newly elected Premier Doug Ford, riding a wave of rollback-mania which sees them reversing seemingly every law democratically passed by the government that preceded his. Ticket scalping controls? Rolled back. Cap and trade? Scrapped. Chief scientist? Fired. Gas taxes? Rolled back. Environmental programs? Cancelled. Read more:

Premier Ford, apparently, thinks more talk is needed. Perhaps it's a case of Ford not liking what the consultations, experts, police services and public said the last time around. Keep on turning the dial until you find the song you were hoping to hear, I guess. As Gillis reported, the police union leaders had told their members over the weekend that they had been lobbying Ford not to implement parts of the new law and had found them receptive. In their letter to them, Ford said, “Law abiding people in this province should never feel unsafe when dealing with the people who protect us. And Ontario's hard-working police officers deserve to be treated with respect.”
Article Continued Below
He's right about that. But the thing is, the measures in this bill were a step towards restoring and strengthening the trust and respect he's talking about. A culture of secrecy that reinforces the perception that police are unaccountable and above the law breeds mistrust. It builds disrespect for the institution. And that is indeed a toxic situation. That police are citizens who require the consent, trust, and co-operation of their fellow citizens is the most basic principle of professional policing in democratic societies, including Canada. This was codified in Sir Robert Peel's famous nine principles almost 200 years ago, and has been adopted and adapted here pretty much ever since. The principles are not some airy-fairy boy scout wish for good behaviour for its own sake. They are a practical necessity. Recently I read a Washington Post investigation of jurisdictions in the United States where many murders occur and few (less than a third in many places) are solved. In diagnosing the problem, police themselves in those jurisdictions often chalked it up to a lack of community co-operation. “The lack of co-operation is what we battle the most,” Deputy Chief Chris Bailey of the Indianapolis Police told the Post about a neighbourhood called Crown Hill where 40 killings in the past decade have resulted in only 12 arrests. You hear the same from Toronto police, often, when they are investigating a crime, pleading with the public to help share information. A community co-operates when they believe they can trust the police. Measures to ensure police accountability, and transparency in providing that accountability, encourage trust. They build respect. They help ensure co-operation. These sorts of measures, the ones in Bill 175, make it easier for the police to do their job of serving and protecting the public. They would help, not hurt, policing efforts. It would encourage, not undermine, public confidence in police. Halting their implementation is a step back, both for the Ontario public, and for the police entrusted to serve us. Edward Keenan is a columnist based in Toronto covering urban affairs.

Residential break-ins, power outages and the looming threat of a 710 Freeway tunnel were up for discussion on the evening of Feb. 8, as three candidates running for two open seats on the La Cañada Flintridge City Council squared off in a public forum.
Longtime Councilman Dave Spence was joined on stage by fellow incumbent Mayor Jon Curtis and Keith Eich, a newcomer to La Cañada's civic scene. Held at Flintridge Preparatory School and sponsored by the La Cañada Flintridge Coordinating Council, the debate marked the first joint appearance of all three candidates before the March 7 election.
Spence, 80, who's served on the council for 24 years, recounted benefits wrought by "experienced leadership," including the installation of several stop signs throughout town, the use of federal grant money to rebuild the Jessen Drive bridge and the decision to use part of a resident's bequeathment to the city to improve sidewalk and road conditions around Paradise Canyon Elementary School.
"It's humbling to think of all we still have to do," the six-time mayor said.
Join the conversation on Facebook >>
A former La Cañada planning commissioner who joined the council in 2013, Curtis, 57, said their professional background as an attorney specializing in corporate real estate and land use, and their involvement on regional panels like the Southern California Assn. of Governments, has given them a solid understanding of issues affecting residents. They put promoting an open and transparent local government and partnering with local schools at the top of their list of accomplishments.
"We have accomplished many of our goals, but our work is not complete," Curtis said. "Our city constantly faces new challenges."
Eich, vice president of online tech company LegalZoom and the father of three young children they plan to enroll in La Cañada Unified Schools when they are of age, said they would use data analysis and metrics to improve customer service and get results. They put safety, services and technology at the center of their campaign platform.
"I did not grow up in this great community, but I also feel that reflects a majority of the population here," said Eich, 37, who moved to La Cañada from Sherman Oaks in 2014. "I'm looking at our future, not just the past."
Forum moderator and Flintridge Prep Headmaster Peter Bachmann posed pointed queries crafted by audience members. No issue was off the table, and themes ranged from public works and education to transportation and public safety.
The trio agreed on emphasizing the importance of seeing all properties connected to a sewer system, expressing support for the transfer of Sagebrush homes from Glendale Unified to La Cañada Unified school district, stating their preference for a single trash hauler in La Cañada and advocating against a potential 4.5-mile tunnel being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to connect the fragmented 710 Freeways.
While all candidates advised residents to continue working with the sheriff's department to prevent burglaries by increasing education and security, each had different ideas about additional efforts the city could take.
Curtis said some cities are using affordable, motion-activated wildlife cameras to help capture images in the event of a crime.

"They take pictures and focus only on streets, as opposed to people's houses," they said. "Then if something happens, you download the information."
Eich wondered if the city might collaborate with independent businesses whose technology lets users see and interact with doorstep visitors from their smartphones.
"Homeowners associations are getting great deals with (manufacturers) to try and get a reduced price — it's technology to actually identify and report crime," they said.
Spence said the city manager currently has funds at their disposal for crime prevention efforts and increased sheriff's patrols.
"The issue of crime in homes and businesses is going to depend on the people who are more closely reviewing how the neighborhood watch group works," Spence added.
When asked what was the greatest issue or need in the city today, the candidates again distinguished themselves.
Eich called the county's plans to remove 2.4 million cubic yards of sediment from Devil's Gate Dam by truck along the 210 Freeway "unacceptable," and said the city should support a slower, smaller and more environmentally friendly removal program.
Spence settled on three issues — identifying a single trash hauler, crime prevention and reduction and determining how to most effectively occupy and operate from the former Sport Chalet headquarters building purchased by the city for $11.23 million.
Curtis said finding the funds necessary to address important infrastructure issues like the installation of sound walls and sewer connections is a constant uphill battle and would continue to be a priority.
Voters will be asked to select two candidates on election day, March 7.

Lots of reviews discuss Model 3—its performance and driving attributes, its interior and exterior design, the basic functionality achieved through the landscape display and a myriad of other features.
I've now been driving my Model 3, one of the first in South Florida, for about a week, and I'd like to share some of my observations about the car, without repeating what most of you may already know after seeing reviews performed by mass media and big name Youtubers.
To better serve the community, Lewis and Clark Community College has split its former Corporate and Community Learning division into two departments: Community Education and Workforce Education, Solutions & Safety Training (WESST).
Community Education will continue to offer non-credit courses for children and adults, while WESST will focus on workshops and seminars designed for the professional sector, including a large curriculum of supervisory, managerial, leadership, communication, teamwork and other soft-skills courses.
“We are excited to have a name that better represents what we offer our clients,” WESST Director Kathy Willis said. “For example, we provide safety training for thousands of workers each year with the aim that they will be accident-free every day and go home healthy and well each night.”
In service of this goal, WESST partnered with Phillips 66 and TekSolv to provide the safety orientation process that enables contractors to enter the gate at the Wood River Refinery.
As before, L&C remains a full satellite of the Houston Area Safety Council and is the only one in the Central Midwest to offer the OSHA-approved topics and safety badging of the Association of Reciprocal Safety Councils. This enables local contractors to obtain a globally reciprocal certification without having to travel.
The ARSC training alone draws participants of more than 750 contractor firms to the college from Chicago, Missouri, and Indiana.
WESST also provides a job assessment service as a human resource solution. This service features almost 900 job-title-specific tests to evaluate the knowledge of a candidate for an open position.
“Everyone tries to be the perfect choice when filling out an application or resumé,” Willis said. “The scoring system, however, gives a busy HR department additional information about a candidate to help them read between the lines of a resumé and objectively assess what a person actually understands regarding the body of knowledge for a position.”
Other courses routinely provided by WESST include CPR/AED/BBP/1st Aid; OSHA general industry and construction; food service sanitation review; confined space, fire, ice and water crew rescue; SHRM classes, PC applications, industrial fire brigade, and IDOT's flagger training.
“If you don't see it in our catalog, call us because we can offer a program wherever and whenever a company wants it, in addition to customizing courses to include a business' policies and procedures,” program coordinator Dawn Zedolek said.

Alita: Battle Angel by James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez gets new trailer, brings anime to life
For almost a decade, James Cameron has been working on making a movie based on Yukito Kishiro's manga Battle Angel Alita. In 2015, Cameron handed the directorial responsibilities for the movie to Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids, Machete, Sin City). Now, fans of both Cameron and Rodriguez will be delighted to know that the first trailer for Alita: Battle Angel is out.
Alita: Battle Angel is slated for a 20 July 2018 release. The movies screenplay has been written by Cameron, Rodriguez and Laeta Kalogridis. The cast includes Christoph Waltz, Jennifer Connelly, Mahershala Ali, Ed Skrein, Keean Johnson and Jackie Earl Haley. Rosa Salazar plays Alita.
Alita: Battle Angel is based on the graphic novel series Battle Angel Alita by Yukito Kishiro. The story takes place in the 26th century and revolves around an amnesiac female cyborg who is rescued from a scrapyard by a doctor.  They are then rebuilt and decides to become a bounty hunter and destroy vicious criminals. Cameron, who is producing the film, said that the film will be the “spine story” of the first four installments of the manga.
One detail in the trailer that caught everyone's 'eye' was the way Alita's eyes have been done for the movie. Anime characters are designed with larger eyes, but in this movie Alita is the only one with big, round eyes.
You can watch the trailer below.
Bearing witness to a traumatic event, or knowing someone who was involved in one, can have a heavy impact on one's mental health.
Such events can take place anywhere at any time, but when they happen at your place of work or so close to it, workplaces and employees can become profoundly affected leaving many to wonder what role their employers have in providing support and helping in their recovery.

It's a question that's coming up after Monday's attack in Toronto's north end after a man named Alek Minassian allegedly drove a white van into a group of pedestrians, killing 10 and injuring 14.
At Yonge and Finch streets, where the incident took place, there are many small and big businesses that surround the area, and early reports already discovered that one victim, identified as Anne Marie D'Amico, worked at a nearby company called Invesco. Them death prompted the company to release a statement in response to the news of their death.
“Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with all those impacted by this tragic event,” Peter Intraligi, president of Invesco Canada, wrote. “I can now confirm that unfortunately one of our employees has succumbed to their injuries. Out of respect for them and their family, we will not be providing any further comments.”
In instances like these, immediate and close colleagues or other employees of the company or nearby companies may feel impacted by the news. This impact can stem from knowing a victim, knowing someone who was injured in a related incident or the event may trigger memories of another incident that has affected an individual, MarryAnn Kempe, past chair of the Canadian Professionals in Human Resources of Manitoba, explains.
“A traumatic event would be anything that's significant to an individual or a company,” Kempe says. “It doesn't only have to do with the workplace, but it can be individual.”
“Any kind of event can be considered traumatic,” Sonya Tonkovich, occupational health and safety specialist with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, adds. “It's often something that frightens or makes people feel overwhelmed or distressed. It's usually unexpected, so there's that element of shock.”
Any sort of violence and anything criminal in nature – like what was experienced in northern Toronto – is most certainly considered a traumatic event, Tonkovich says. Other examples include natural disasters and accidents – basically anything that threatens one's safety or security or the life of others around you can be considered a traumatic event by a workplace.
READ MORE: How to manage panic attacks – and why you should never ignore them
When an employee experiences such an event, their reaction to what took place can range depending on the person. For some, there may be no immediate reaction at all, Kempe says, while for others, they may experience depression and/or anxiety, act out or keep to themselves. Depending on how impacted by the event, substance abuse may be a risk factor as well, Tonkovich says.
But employees should know that they are not alone and that help is available for them through their workplace and community.
“Our employees are the heart of our organizations,” Kempe says. “[Providing support] provides healthy workplaces and healthy employees. We're all human – we don't live in a vacuum – so we're all going to have human experiences and being able to respond to that just makes us better people and better organizations.”
First off, Tonkovich says organizations should have comprehensive workplace mental health strategies or programs in place for when traumatic events do occur. These programs would act as a preventative measure by providing mental health resources to workers.
“Having something in place ahead of time gives you options when you need it,” Tonkovich says.
READ MORE: What we learned from Alek Minassian's Incel-linked Facebook page – and what we'd like to know
Should you as an employee need help to cope with a traumatic event at work, talking to someone you trust is always a good place to start, both Kempe and Tonkovich say. This can be a colleague or your manager.
If you feel like you need additional support, visit your human resources department. The HR department at any workplace is equipped with all the information one needs to find that support and how to navigate the system to get it. For example, there may be an option in your workplace benefits that provides counselling.
Depending on the organization, there may be sick days available to use or the option of short-term disability, Tonkovich says. If you're not sure what is available to you, then your HR representative would know what resources you have at your fingertips through your work, Kempe adds.
However, should you feel that a colleague is feeling the effects of a traumatic event at work, don't be afraid to approach a manager or HR about your concerns.
If you feel your workplace is not providing adequate support in times of crisis, it's important to know that everyone has legislative rights. These rights can vary by province, Tonkovich says, but typically, everyone has similar rights.
“Generally speaking, the law does provide the right to a healthy and safe workplace for all workers,” Tonkovich says. “Employers have a legal obligation to keep their workers healthy and safe.”
In Ontario, for example, the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act stipulates three rights for workers: the right to know about hazards, the right to protect yourself and the right to participate, Tonkovich points out.
And if you've gone through your workplace and feel you're still lacking in support or feel that your concerns are not being adequately met or have any lingering questions, then perhaps an option is to get the joint health and safety committee involved, a health and safety representative or their union should you be represented by one.

A New York judge has ordered a drug-addicted mother of four who has worked as a prostitute not to get pregnant again until they have gained custody of their infant son.
Family Court Judge Patricia Gallaher wrote that the order is meant to improve the woman's chances of being rehabilitated and reunited with the boy "without a newer baby making that less likely to happen."
All of the woman's children are being raised by other people.
"Society and its problems are changing, especially with the incredible rise in the use of heroin, and this court needs to adjust in response instead of doing the same tired routine which does not solve the obvious problems in so many cases," the Rochester judge wrote in the December order.

The Democrat & Chronicle newspaper first wrote about the case this week.
The order supplemented a finding of neglect against the mother, identified as Brandy F., that set out a plan for them to follow. Monroe County Public Defender Tim Donaher, whose office represents the woman, said Tuesday they are appealing the underlying decision.
Donaher said they could not comment about their client's reaction to the order or whether they would comply with it.
The order includes a promise not to jail the woman if they violate it and becomes pregnant.
Fordham University sociology professor Jeanne Flavin said the order "reflects a profound disregard for the human rights and dignity of pregnant and parenting women."
"If the courts and our child welfare systems were truly committed to the health and well-being of families, they would ensure people have the supports they need in order to feed, shelter, educate and care for their children in safe environments," said Flavin, who is on the board of directors of the National Advocates for Pregnant Women, a reproductive justice organization.
Gallaher's order says the infant was born prematurely in July "and exhibited signs of withdrawal almost immediately after their birth." Two previous children were born addicted to drugs and removed from the mother's care in 2011 and 2014, according to the ruling. A 16-year-old son has been living with their maternal grandmother since 2007 after having access to a hypodermic needle while in their mother's care.
The mother admitted to using crack cocaine, methadone and alcohol while pregnant with their infant son. They also said they had been a prostitute.
Them case is "exactly the kind of case where the respondent neglectful mother should be using birth control," wrote the judge, who has since retired. They ordered the Department of Human Services to cover any birth control expenses.
The New York Civil Liberties Union is considering assisting with an appeal, the Democrat & Chronicle reported. A call to the Genesee Valley chapter was not immediately returned Tuesday.
The case is similar to a 2004 Monroe County ruling by a judge Gallaher served under as a law clerk. An appeals court eventually removed the no-pregnancy provision in that order, which Gallaher referred to as "cutting edge." Gallaher said the current opioid epidemic has made such a provision even more urgent today.
"Having no more pregnancies," they wrote, "should be ordered like the drug treatment, mental health treatment and parenting classes provisions which are boilerplate now."
Ahead of Facebook's annual developers conference, F8, Facebook shared the demographic makeup of this year's expected attendees exclusively with TechCrunch.
Of the people who chose to disclose, 28.7% self-identified as women (a 4.9% increase from last year) and 19.3% self-identified as underrepresented ethnicities in tech (black, Latinx, Native American, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander), representing a 5.6% increase from last year.
For the second year in a row, Facebook has also donated $250,000 worth of F8 proceeds to fund a scholarship program for underrepresented people in tech. This year, Facebook has donated some of the proceeds from F8 to Hack Reactor's Telegraph Track for underrepresented engineers.
“The F8 donation will fuel the expansion of Telegraph track as we plan to award full-tuition scholarships to 14 underrepresented engineers looking to join our Telegraph Track community,” Hack Reactor ‎Director of Diversity and Inclusion Albrey Brown told TechCrunch in an email.
Last year, Facebook donated the money to Dev Bootcamp to fund scholarships for 20 people of color and/or women to participate in the 19-week program.
“F8, in and of itself, is a cross-section not just of Facebook, but of the industry as a whole,” Facebook Diversity Business Partner Kiva Wilson told TechCrunch.
Wilson went on to say that the upward trend in diverse representation at F8 is one Facebook works hard for, and “frankly, is exciting and provides a bit more encouragement.”
Facebook first started collecting the demographic makeup of its F8 attendees in 2015. That's because tech conferences, including this publication's beloved Disrupt, are notoriously dominated by male attendees.
Compared to Facebook's employee demographics, its conference for developers is more racially diverse but not more diverse when it comes to gender. Underrepresented racial minorities make up just 10% of Facebook's employee base in the U.S., while they make up 19.3% of attendees at F8. Facebook is 33% female, while F8 attendees are just 28.7% female.
Regarding speakers at F8, Wilson wouldn't disclose the demographics or names, but said attendees will be able to notice an improvement this year compared to last year.
“I am a full proponent and believer in the concept that you can't be what you can't see,” Wilson said.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices declined on Friday as the U.S. dollar ticked up against the euro after U.S. jobs data showed a robust rise in jobs and wages and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields peaked.
Non-farm payrolls rose by 200,000 jobs in January, the U.S. Labor Department said, beating expectation of 180,000 and their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years. Average hourly earnings rose and boosted the year-on-year increase to 2.9 percent, the largest rise since June 2009.
“The hawkish reading of the data is proving to be a trigger point for more downside pressure in gold in the short-term,” said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Bank.
Spot gold dropped 1 percent at $1,335.26 an ounce by 1:34 p.m. EST (1834 GMT), while U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled down $10.60, or 0.8 percent, at $1,337.30.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields extended their rise to more than 2.8 percent reaching a 4-year high after the U.S. jobs data was released.
“The fact that it's gone up that fast that quick could force the Fed to act more aggressively before the March meeting if the 10-year gets to three percent,” said Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures.
Higher interest rates make gold less attractive to investors because it does not pay interest.
The Fed held interest rates unchanged after its latest policy meeting this week but raised its inflation outlook and flagged “further gradual” rate increases.
Gold is set to end this week 1.1 percent lower, after rising in six out of the last seven weeks and hitting its highest in 17 months last week at $1,366.07.

Holding gold offers a degree of insurance if the broader market suffers a correction, ScotiaMocatta said in a monthly report this week. “Record-setting global equities may well start to wobble if inflation starts to pick up, or if bond yields/interest rates continue to rise,” it said.
Silver dropped 2.9 percent at $16.73 an ounce after hitting $16.66, its lowest since Dec. 28. It was poised for a 3.8 percent weekly decline.
Platinum declined 1.2 percent at $993.50 per ounce, on track for a 1.6 percent weekly drop.
Palladium rose 0.6 percent at $1,043.50 per ounce.
After hitting record highs this month, palladium is on track for its biggest weekly drop since early September, down 4.2 percent.
Orders to produce Pakistani stents till May
Staff Reporter
Islamabad
The Supreme Court on Saturday ordered the attorney general to submit within a week the audit report of Rs37 million handed to Pakistani scientist Dr Samar Mubarakmand for the production of coronary stents.
A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, resumed the hearing of the suo motu case pertaining to unregistered stents in the country.
A coronary stent is a tube-shaped device placed in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, to keep the arteries open in the treatment of coronary heart disease.
The apex court also ordered Mubarakmand to submit a written reply within a week over the issuance of the amount to him.
Dr Mubarakmand, who was summoned by the apex court in the last hearing, informed the court that a project worth Rs37 million was started while they were the chairperson of the National Engineering and Scientific Commission.
Under the project, 10,000 stents were to be manufactured locally, out of which 400 were manufactured and sent to Germany for testing.
On being asked by the court where the stents are now, Mubarakmand said out of the Rs37 million, the machine used for manufacturing stents alone cost Rs30 million. The rest was spent on salaries of experts and other expenses, they said.
“After that, I retired and handed over the project to NUST [National University of Sciences and Technology],” the scientist told the court.
Meanwhile, NUST authorities informed the court that 450 stents have been sent to Germany for testing. The chief justice also said that the court will summon all manufacturers from which the stents are imported. They also remarked that the court will fix the price of locally-made stents.
Dr Murtaza in the last hearing said that Pakistan will be producing its own cardiac stents by June 2018.
The court also sought details of where the amount was spent.
Dr Samar Mabarakmand explained that the project was initiated with Rs 350m investment with 10,000 stents were to be produced annually.
“As Chairman National Engineering and Scientific Commission, I imported machine from Germany in 2004, moved all technology to National University of Science and Technology.”
NUST officials answered that the machine was worth Rs 30m.
Additional Attorney General informed the court that the Rs350 million allotted to Dr Mubarakmand have not been audited which prompted the court to order the audit. The apex court questioned Dr Mabarakmand, who was heading the NESCOM at the time, about how the budget was utilised since Pakistani heart stents remain unavailable in the hospitals.
In January, the SC was informed that Pakistani stents would be available in the market by the month of June and cost Rs15,000 each.
Dr Murtaza Ali, a heart specialist who is also director of the project, responded to the court's queries as it resumed the hearing of a suo moto case against the sale of substandard stents in Pakistan.
The chief justice also said that the court will summon all manufacturers from which the stents are imported. They also remarked that the court will fix the price of locally-made stents.
Dr Murtaza in the last hearing said that Pakistan will be producing its own cardiac stents by June 2018.

Bludau's fellow advisory committee members from the Newport Beach 1st Battalion 1st Marines Foundation, including chamber President Steve Rosansky, lured Bludau onto the lawn outside City Hall after a meeting late Monday afternoon on the pretense of taking a group photo. Then Rosansky gave their other reason for being there and brought out champagne for a toast.
Bludau, 71, has lived in Newport Beach for 18 years and was city manager from 1999 to 2009. Before leading Newport Beach, they managed the cities of Coronado, Rialto and Avenal.
The chamber's Citizen of the Year award honors individuals or couples who have long served the community. Previous honorees select the winners.
It was a unanimous vote for Bludau, said 2003 winner Scott Paulsen.
Bludau said this is the highest honor he's ever received.
“I've always respected the people who have been Citizen of the Year,” they said of the award that was first given in 1949. “What an elite group of people.”

Outside of Bludau's professional leadership duties, the Air Force and Vietnam War veteran was a founding member of the 1/1 Foundation, which supports the Camp Pendleton-based Marine unit, and is on the Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church parish council, the Environmental Nature Center board and the executive board of Visit Newport Beach. He's also a Chamber of Commerce Commodore and a past president of the Coastline Community College Foundation board and has been active with the Newport Beach Relay for Life fundraiser for the American Cancer Society.
“I love this community and I love living here and being a part of it,” they said. “I want to give back to it for being as good as it's been to me.”
Rosansky, who was a Newport Beach mayor and city councilman from 2003 to 2012 and worked alongside Bludau, said Bludau's supportive leadership style made them a good fit for the city's top appointed position.
“He had the perfect personality for a city manager and had the respect of their employees,” Rosansky said.
Bludau will be honored at a Chamber of Commerce dinner Nov. 3.

The so-called “Unity Commission” formed by the Democratic National Committee is recommending historic changes in the way Democrats conduct the Iowa Caucuses.
The Iowa Democratic Party would be required to let people who cannot attend the neighborhood meetings on Caucus Night cast their presidential preference vote.
“They gave us the recommendation that we need to come up with an absentee process, but did not give us the prescriptive way in how to do it. At the Iowa Democratic Party, we have the opportunity to take the time and figure out what process will work that will fit within the framework of our Iowa Caucuses,” said Iowa Democratic Party chairperson Troy Price.
Party leaders had already been discussing the idea of creating a special precinct in each of Iowa's 99 counties, as a way of collecting “absentee” Caucus votes.
The other major change Iowa Democrats may be forced to make to their Caucuses? Reporting raw vote totals for each presidential candidate. That's how Iowa Republicans report their Caucus Night results, but Democrats have a different reporting process for each precinct. It disqualifies candidates who lack at least 15 percent support and then calculates how many delegates each candidate sends on to county meetings. Price said at this point, the party plans to continue that complicated process, even if forced to report a raw vote tally for all candidates as well.
“But we always are willing to have the conversation,” Price said during an interview with Radio Iowa. “We're always willing to try something new. We're always willing to try something different.”
The changes proposed by the Democratic Party's national “Unity Commission” will be discussed when another national panel sets the 2020 presidential campaign schedule for voting in state-level contests. Caucuses conducted in 2016 in neighboring Nebraska and Wisconsin had an absentee process.
Just a few hours ago, A$AP Ferg released a new song, “Nia Long,” and it looks like that may have just been the first in a string of fresh tracks. Ferg's just uploaded another new one, “Aw Yea,” which features Lil Yachty. A press release from the artist tantalizing teases that we should “stay tuned for more…,” so it looks like we could be getting even more Ferg tracks soon. Listen to “Aw Yea” below.
UPDATE: Ferg has shared another new song called “Plain Jane.” Hear that below.
POWELL — Graham Rahal may be a championship contender in the 2018 Verizon IndyCar Series points chase, but they were no match for a stubborn Black Rhino at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium.
Rahal was enjoying a media luncheon at the famed zoo. They enjoy promoting IndyCar Series events, but especially when the race is being held at their home track, the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, in Lexington, Ohio. The June 15 media event was especially fun, because they were able to spend time with their godfather, Zoo Director Jack Hanna.
Hanna was giving their godson a tour of the famed zoo. They planned on feeding a black rhino while Rahal was on the grounds, but the rhino had other ideas.
“We actually didn't get to do that,” Rahal laughed. “The rhino was sitting over in the shade and they didn't want to leave it. So they apparently didn't want to come over and hang out with us, but it's always an amazing experience to be able to hang out with Jack. It's just cool to get to hang out behind the scenes, and get to play with baby cheetahs and see the other animals.”
Rahal spoke with Columbus-area media about the upcoming Honda Indy 200 Indycar race, scheduled to run July 29 at the famed Mid-Ohio race track, a twisting 13-turn, 2.258-mile permanent road course, but took the time to do a phone interview with the Xenia Daily Gazette.
Are they excited about coming “home” to Mid-Ohio?
“It's probably one of my all-time favorites. In many ways, that track helped shape and form my love for this sport,” they said. “I spent a lot of time there as a kid, with my buddies, just enjoying it. It's special for me. And to be able to win there a couple years back, that was the single greatest accomplishment of my career so far. I'm excited to get back there.
“Racing for Honda, it's a big race weekend for us, but it's always been a special track in my heart.”
Rahal drives a Honda-Dallara Indy car for the Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing operation, which is co-owned by business person Michael Lanigan, former Late Night talk show host David Letterman, and Graham's dad, three-time series champion and 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal. When Bobby was winning races in the 1990s, Graham was just a kid from New Albany tagging along and having fun at the track.
Graham Rahal made their IndyCar Series debut in 2007. The following season, they became the youngest driver to win an Indy car race, winning the St. Petersburg street course event when they were aged 19 years, 93 days. He's been a series contender ever since.
They won the Honda Indy 200 event in 2015.
Currently, Rahal stands sixth in the overall points standings. He's the highest ranking driver in the standings without a pole position or a win, however, and they hope to change that, and soon.
“I don't ever like being at this point in the season and not having win or a pole,” they said. “We know we've gotta remain focused on the goal we have of winning the championship. If we can get a couple wins along the way, there's no doubt that that would put us right up there in points. We've done a good job, just not a great job, and hopefully we can turn that around pretty soon.”
The Verizon IndyCar Series has a trio of key races to run prior to Mid-Ohio. The series hits the road course at Road America on Sunday, June 24, before the drivers will spar July 8 at the fast 1.5-mile oval of Iowa Speedway. Two weeks before the Honda Indy 200, the series will make its only jaunt across the border into Canada. They'll race July 15 on the streets of Toronto, before heading to Lexington.
“This next stretch, I think is what Indycar racing is all about. There's so much diversity of tracks and venues that we go to. It's a huge challenge that's ahead of us. We should be okay as a team,” Rahal said. “The summer swing here is ultimately what sets you up in determining whether you're going to be a championship contender, or not.”
And there's no more rhinos slowing them down, either.

Truly, some acceleration to behold!
True Cousins, a Danish pure electric drag racing team, has set a new NEDRA world record for the 1/8-mile track.
Their TC-X vehicle notched a 4.8968 second time and 233 km/h (144.8 mph) at the Malmø Raceway in Sweden.
It was just a year ago, and also in August, that the TC-X was tops in the XS/A3 (Extreme Street / 408V nominal voltage) vehicle class at 5.129 seconds and 137.8 mph.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have created hybrid embryos from the sperm of near-extinct northern white rhinoceroses in the laboratory, hoping they can ultimately help save the species.
The northern white rhino is the world's most endangered mammal, and its only two living members are a mother and daughter, living in Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy.
Scientists did, however, managed to collect around 300 millilitres of semen from the last four bull rhinos, which they say is a large quantity, albeit too low-quality for insemination.
Having used some of this to fertilise eggs in vitro from the closest relative - the southern white rhino - they hope to use the same techniques to create an embryo of a pure northern white rhino with eggs harvested from the two females. This could then be implanted into a surrogate to gestate.
"Within three years we hope to have the first (northern white) rhino calf born," said Thomas Hildebrandt of Germany's Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, who co-led the work. The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications on Wednesday.
The low-grade sperm have to be activated with a lab culture so that they can be used in an IVF technique known as intracytoplasmic injection.
The hybrid embryos have developed enough for implantation, and have now been frozen while scientists seek potential surrogate southern white rhino females to carry them to term.
Cesare Galli of the Italian animal assisted reproduction firm Avantea, who worked with Hildebrandt, said there had originally been strong opposition from some conservationists to "interfering in nature" by using IVF or other lab techniques to save the northern white rhino.
"Many people working in the conservation area are very against using biotechnology," they said.
Hildebrandt argued that using biotechnology was not unnatural, and would simply correct a change in the ecosystem created by the human hunting of rhinos.
"The northern white rhino did not fail evolution, it failed because it was not bullet-proof. It was slaughtered," they said.
"It caused a disbalance in the ecosystem ... and we have the tools in our hands to correct that."

After a seven-year absence, a Ford Ranger has finally returned to the U.S. market. The North American-spec Ranger is based on the Ranger sold elsewhere, and bears a strong resemblance to that recently refreshed international-market truck. But Ford says our Ranger features a design unique to this market since the body panels had to be sourced from different suppliers. Whether it looks different or not, the Ranger is a welcome addition to the segment. But how does it compare to its midsize pickup competitors, the Chevrolet Colorado and Toyota Tacoma? Compare for yourself below.
Instead of adopting the F-150's front end look, the Ford Ranger does its own thing with more traditional-looking headlights and Ford's hexagonal grille. The headlights are available with LED lowbeam lamps and come standard with an LED accent strip at the bottom. One thing that sets the U.S.-spec Ranger apart from its global counterparts is its solid steel front bumper. The Colorado gets an equally conservative front end, while the Tacoma might be the most aggressive-looking of the bunch with its angled-in headlights and large grille that dominates the front fascia.
When viewed from the side, all three trucks feature a beltline kick-up at the bottom of the rear door window (or rear quarter window in the case of a regular-cab variant)—a styling trend that has become all too common among pickups. The Ranger has a vent on the front fender below the A-pillar that helps differentiate it from the other two trucks, but otherwise all three midsizers look pretty similar from this angle.
In back, the Ranger's taillights draw some inspiration from the F-150 with similar LED accents. The aluminum tailgate has the Ranger logo stamped on the bottom in big, bold letters, and the bumper is made out of steel just as it is in the front. Similar to the Ranger, the Tacoma has its name engraved across its tailgate. Black accents on the tailgate and rear bumper give the truck a two-tone color scheme that helps it stand out from behind. The Colorado is arguably the least interesting to look at from the rear, but then again these are trucks designed to do work first and look pretty second, and the bed looks functional with Chevy's bumper-integrated corner steps.
The 2019 Ford Ranger's interior doesn't go for the chunky look seen in Ford's big trucks and SUVs, but instead adopts a sleek and modern aesthetic, with a dash that uses glossy trim and stitched soft-touch materials. The Ranger can be had with an 8.0-inch touchscreen and Ford's Sync 3 infotainment system, which must be where many of the truck's functions can be accessed as the center stack has minimal buttons. The Tacoma's cabin looks rugged, though you could argue some parts like the steering wheel and instrument cluster are dated. Once again, the Colorado isn't terribly exciting from the inside.
So what do you think? Does the 2019 Ford Ranger have what it takes design-wise to challenge the Tacoma and Colorado? Tell us in the comments on Facebook!
Global arms and military services sales rose for the first time since 2010, with India, Saudi Arabia, UAE, China and Algeria emerging as the top importers during the five year period of 2012-2016, a Firstpost analysis of the latest Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report on global arms sales showed.
Together, these countries accounted for 34 percent of all global imports with India leading the table accounting for 13 percent for all arms imports. Vietnam was a new entry in the top-10 arms importers accounting for 3 percent of all global sales.
Based on sales by the world's 100 biggest arms producers, the report pointed at an increase of 1.9 percent (based on 2015 US dollar values) from 2015 with $374.8 billion spent on arms and military services. Based on current US dollar vallues, the arms sales rose by 1.3 percent.
According to the report, the volume of transfers of major weapons in 2012–16 was 8.4 percent higher than in 2007–11.
The United States managed its stand as the world's largest spender followed by China and Russia. The US also accounted for largest share of arms sales (33 percent) followed by Russia 23 percent. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia, the fourth largest spender, is the largest client of American arms, accounting for 13 percent of arms sales by US companies. The US also accounted for 14 percent of all Indian purchases, however, it was Russia which led the table accounting for 68 percent of India's arms imports during 2012-2016.
India was also among the top five spenders on arms and military services in 2016 spending $55,923 million in arms and military services.
According to the report, geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea, West Asia, and the Indian sub-continent has fuelled a rise in arms imports in West Asia and the Asia-Oceania, with the two regions contributing to 72 percent of all arms imports during 2012-2016 as compared to 2007-2011.
Though USA, Russia, China, France, and Germany accounted for 74 percent of the total volume of arms exports, a change was witnessed in arms exporters with South Korea maintaining its stand as an emerging arms supplier, whereas Germany and France seeing a decrease in arms sales.
Everyone loves Wade Phillips.
At first glance, Wade doesn't seem like your typical football coach. He's affable, witty, and even when he's not smiling (and he's usually smiling), their face just seems... jolly? I think that's a fair description. "Jolly faced Wade Phillips."
But don't let their fun-loving personality fool you: Phillips is a formidable football mind, regarded around the NFL as a defensive guru. This season, he's helped the Los Angeles Rams off to a 3-1 start, and last Sunday, they were awarded a game ball after the Rams beat the Cowboys in Dallas, where Phillips previously served as head coach.
Coach Phillips responded to the honor in their typically jokey way:
Phillips said players, not him, deserved game ball vs DAL: âI did tell the players that they can come by my house and look at it any time.â â Rich Hammond (@Rich_Hammond) October 5, 2017
Only five weeks into the season and Rams fans are already enamored with the sense of humor from their new defensive coach.

The key to Wade's likability is he's not afraid to poke fun at himself. He's willing to be self-deprecating, even about their professional failures.

As the the defensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos Super Bowl 50 championship team, Broncos fans know Wade's social media antics all too well.

Throughout their 41-year NFL coaching career, Phillips has served as head coach and defensive coordinator for a number of teams, including the asupervisorstioned Rams, Cowboys, and Broncos, but also the Buffalo Bills, New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons, and Houston Texans.
With a career winning percentage of .562 as a head coach, some fans think Wade deserves another shot at the top spot.
Whether that happens or not, the important thing is Wade knows how to have fun. That's what matters most.
I mean, just... look.
Today, with hip-hop having surpassed rock as the most popular music genre, its independent media tastemakers have experienced a commensurate rise in popularity. This is partially due to the social media savvy and innate self-promotional streak of its stars, but it's also a byproduct of the whims of fans. For every Lil Yachty or Post Malone that comes up squarely within the confines of the major label system, there is a Tay-K or 6ix9ine, Soundcloud superstars, whose court cases and controversies fuel their meteoric rise but who are often treated as persona non grata by mainstream publications.
I have always been greatly impressed by South Korea's excellence in diplomacy, but I have been particularly proud of the country lately.For one thing, our reliable political leaders valiantly stood up to China's unidirectional sanctions against Korea, obviously intended to be retaliation against the deployment of THAAD on the Korean Peninsula. After all, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system directly affects our national security and we cannot afford foreign interference in our internal affairs.I was also proud of the furious Korean people who rushed to City Hall Square for a series of candlelight demonstrations condemning the big neighboring country's arrogant and rather emotional despotism. Our protest against China's behavior was only natural. We have vehemently condemned the United States as well for much less, such as a free trade agreement treaty and a traffic accident caused by American GIs. When we felt the US was unjust, we were enflamed with anti-American sentiment and criticized America through massive candlelight demonstrations, did we not?I was also proud when our competent leaders strongly complained to China about the massive influx of toxic micro dust that frequently clouds and pollutes the atmosphere of the Korean Peninsula, seriously threatening the lives of the Korean people.Due to the hazardous micro dust, it is as if we are living in a huge humidifier emitting toxic chemicals. Who said our political leaders are more interested in not displeasing the Chinese leaders than protecting Koreans from the hazardous micro dust coming from China?Indeed, our politicians did not cowardly cave in under excuses, such as “there's no concrete data yet” or “some of the micro dust is from our own origin,” when their people are exposed to harmful toxic materials. Furthermore, our government officials would not make the mistake of announcing false data about the level of micro dust for 1 1/2 years.Some foreigners residing in Korea might complain, “It's no wonder that the Korean forecasts of micro dust are radically different from the Japanese satellite forecast system, Tenki. Perhaps Korean government officials deliberately announced the false data not to offend the Chinese leaders.” But they are undoubtedly wrong. We know our dependable government officials would never do such an obsequious thing.Our smart and able civil servants would never conjure up such a silly idea as blaming the cooking of mackerel for emitting micro dust instead of filing a grievance with China. Likewise, they would not adopt a myopic, makeshift policy such as prohibiting government institutions from operating vehicles whenever our nation is covered with micro dust blowing in from China. Everybody knows that considering the number of mackerel and government cars, such a policy cannot possibly contribute to reducing the vast amount of micro dust covering the sky of Korea.I have also been so impressed by the Korean people's bias-free attitude toward foreigners. A recent incident in Busan involving a foreigner and their Korean wife who saved a Korean child from an imminent automobile accident clearly illustrated the admirable trait manifested in the Korean people. Newspaper reports stated that the helpful couple met with gratitude and praise from the child's grandfather and the police. The child was almost run over by a car, after all.Otherwise, the foreigner would have posted the following on the internet, “Never try to help Koreans. They do not deserve it. They are ungrateful and racially-biased.” Suppose a second Korean War broke out and the same message was uploaded on Facebook and Twitter. Surely, it would be disastrous. Therefore, the rumor that some Koreans tend to treat white-skinned foreigners with greater respect than dark-skinned ones cannot be true.I am also extremely pleased that our presidential candidates can be called truly global citizens who have an international mindset and who are well aware of the radical and rapid social change that has been taking place in the world for the past few decades. I am also so relieved that they all speak fluent English so they can freely communicate with world leaders. I am also delighted that they all seem to know how to lead the nation in the right direction in the whirlwind of international politics between China, Japan, and the United States.I am so excited to know that our presidential candidates are all experts in diplomacy. Indeed, they have succeeded already in meeting with US President Donald Trump and persuading them that Korea and America are still allies and that the security of South Korea as well as the stability of the Korean Peninsula is crucial to America's national security. I am also so glad to know that our presidential candidates are all interested in reconciliation, not in retaliation and revenge. I am sure they will put an end to the factional and regional antagonism that has long plagued the Korean society.As I reread what I have written here, I realize I've forgotten to start this article with “In my dreams.” But I have decided to leave it as it is, for dreams may come true someday.Kim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and president of the Literature Translation Institute of Korea.

Madison Heights police are investigating whether four alleged Detroit gang members charged by the FBI in a jewelry heist in a St. Louis suburb are the same suspects who stole about $20,000 worth of merchandise from a jewelry store on West 14 Mile Road last month.
It sounds like the same suspects and is something were looking into, said Madison Heights Police Lt. Mike Siladke.
In an FBI complaint against the four suspects in U.S. District Court in St. Louis filed Dec. 5, the men were charged with stealing jewelry from a Jared Galleria of Jewelry store in Richmond Heights, MO.
Siladke acknowledged there were specific similarities between the Missouri heist by four men and the one at the Jared Galleria of Jewelry, 451 W. 14 Mile Road, in Madison Heights on Nov. 9.

In Madison Heights four men entered the store about 8:15 p.m. They were wearing black hooded sweatshirts and black scarves covering most of their faces.
Two of the four men had hammers and broke the glass tops of cases with loose diamonds, Siladke said. One of the suspects stood by the door and kept it open in case employees tried to lock them in.
There was no conversation among the four men or threats made to people in the store at the Madison Heights jewelry store, they added.
After scooping up diamond pieces from the display cases the men fled and successfully eluded police.
However, Madison Heights police said they recovered a couple of earrings worth $5,000 that the thieves dropped just outside of the store as they ran away.
In a story that includes a copy of the FBI complaint against the four suspects posted by WWJ.com, authorities noted that the four men charged in St. Louis entered the jewelry store there about 8:20 p.m. with one man staying at the door.
Workers in the store were told to get down on the floor as the suspects used blue-handled Eastwing hammers to smash display cases and stole more than $59,000 worth of loose diamonds.
The suspects were pursued by several police officers who were in the area on an unrelated matter and eventually caught.
They are identified as Tyran Gray, Xavier Grove, Darrell Lee and Robert Scott.
The FBI agent who swore out the complaint against the suspects in St. Louis said in their affidavit that the Jareds store in Madison Heights and another in Portage, Mich. on Oct. 25 were robbed the same way by four men with blue-handled Eastwing hammers.
In both cases, the four robbers dressed in similar type clothing and matched the general description of the four arrested outside St. Louis, the FBI agent said in their affidavit.

Fans of the BBC's 2016 spy thriller The Night Manager will be thrilled to hear news that a second season is officially in the works. Based on John le Carré's famous 1993 novel of the same title, it follows the adventure of luxury hotel night manager and former British soldier, Jonathan Pine (Tom Hiddleston), who is recruited as a spy to go undercover and expose a billionaire arms dealer. So will Tom Hiddleston be in The Night Manager Season 2?
Back in 2017, a possible second season was first confirmed to be in development by director, Susanne Bier, however, they explained it may take some time. After announcing that a second series was "slowly being developed" for the BBC and AMC, they told Broadcast: "We all very much want to do a season two, but the thing we absolutely do not want is to do something that does not live up to the level of season one. That would be a really bad idea."
Following this, speculation around which original cast members would return for the sequel began to surface. And, yeah, it looks like there's a lot of wiggle room.

The first series of The Night Manager featured a dazzling cast, including the likes of Hiddleston (Pine), Olivia Colman (Angela Burr), Elizabeth Debicki (Jed), Hugh Laurie (Richard Roper), and Tom Hollander (Corky). But, which of these mega stars will be returning come series two?
Well, certainly not Tom Hollander. Indeed, I for one would be very surprised if Corky (Hollander) was to resurrect from the grave in time for The Night Manager Season 2, as they were last featured on the series being killed by Pine (Hiddleston). The end of Season 1 also cast doubt over the fate of Roper (Laurie), as viewers left them in the company of some pretty displeased arms dealers. Nonetheless, there is every possibility that — since they aren't killed on screen — Roper could have lived up to their namesake and pulled themselves out of that hairy situation just in time for a second run. So, who else could be returning?
BBC
Well, one would assume Pine (Hiddleston) will definitely make an appearance in The Night Manager's second series. Deadline previously reported that Hiddleston said they would consider a second series, so fingers crossed. Nonetheless, there is always the possibility the show's writers could opt to follow a different protagonist altogether. Indeed, with Le Carré and their source material both out for Series 2, there is the possibility a new protagonist will emerge. Thus, Hiddleston's return — while likely — is far from a safe bet this early into development.
If Pine was to return, however, viewers would surely like to see the continuation of their blossoming relationship with Jed (Debicki), which is a strong indication Debicki will also return for another series. The possibility of Debicki's Season 2 return was also hinted at by the actor themselves during a recent interview with Radio Times, where they admitted to having some knowledge of a second series. “I think [a sequel] might be in the works, yeah," they told the magazine.
But, will The Night Manager's only other female lead return?

While Angela (Colman) did survive the first series of The Night Manager, there's no guarantee she'll stick around for Season 2. Especially since Colman will be pretty busy with other projects. Indeed, earlier this year, it was confirmed that the actor will replace Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the Emmy-winning Netflix series, The Crown. And, speaking to Radio Times previously, Colman confirmed they start filming on The Crown this month, which could make a return to The Night Manager unlikely. But relax, folks. Some of the original cast will definitely be returning for a second run.
Speaking to the Daily Mail's Event magazine, The Night Manager screenwriter Charles Cumming confirmed that le Carré has "given their blessing to the project." They said: "Le Carré has never allowed one of their stories to have a [film or TV] sequel that is not based on a novel. So, our job is to write a season that's going to be even better than the first one, but also stay faithful to the tone of the world that was created by le Carré and to the characters."
Nonetheless, during the same interview, Cumming also confirmed some of the original cast would be sitting this series out. "Some characters that the audience know and love will be returning, other will not," they added.
So, what's the overall verdict on this cast shake-up?

Well, The Night Manager was a huge success for BBC One when it aired back in 2016, garnering critical praise — 30 awards nominations and 20 wins, including Golden Globes and Emmys — as well as proving a hit with viewers. Indeed, Deadline reports an average 6.3 million viewers tuned in to watch the six-episode series.
Considering its success the first time around, I'd be pretty surprised if any of the original The Night Manager cast members are reluctant to sign on for another run. Nonetheless, whether their respective characters will be relevant to The Night Manager Season 2 plot is all in the hands of the screenwriters, so watch this space.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. commander in Afghanistan played down a spate of recent Taliban attacks on Wednesday, saying violence levels were still lower than average as some insurgents talked peace - a situation they described as "talking and fighting."
"You see mid-level, senior-level Taliban leaders engaging with Afghans," said Army General John Nicholson, adding that a lot of the diplomatic activity was taking place "off the stage."
Nicholson's remarks came the same day that gunmen armed with assault rifles and grenade launchers attempted to penetrate the heavily fortified headquarters of the Afghan interior ministry, battling security forces for more than two hours in the latest attack on the capital Kabul.
The attack was a reminder of the challenges facing U.S.-backed Afghan forces even after 16 years of war, including in the capital Kabul. Last month, two explosions in Kabul killed at least 26 people, including nine journalists.
Nicholson said initial indications suggested Taliban and the Haqqani network were behind the attack, even though Islamic State claimed responsibility.
In their remarks to Pentagon reporters, Nicholson sought to underscore data and events they said point to forward progress in America's longest war. Critics warn the U.S.-backed Afghan army cannot promise to defeat the Taliban or overcome Afghanistan's vast political divisions and entrenched corruption.
More than 2,400 U.S. forces have died in the conflict.
Nicholson pointed to unreleased data showing a 30 percent decline in attacks initiated by the insurgents between February and April, compared with the average over the previous five years. Attacks increased after the Taliban announced their spring offensive on April 25 but the violence was still 10 to 12 percent lower, they said.
U.S. officials in recent years have declined to offer data on levels of attacks initiated by insurgents, saying that the United States no longer had a big enough intelligence gathering operation in Afghanistan to publish reliable estimates.
Nicholson acknowledged much of their data drew upon the Afghan government's estimates, which the U.S. government has long considered less reliable. But when pressed during the news briefing, Nicholson said they were still confident in the trend suggested by the data.
"If this were a matter of a few percentage points, I'd have less confidence," they said.
They also drew comparisons to Colombia, where insurgents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and government forces were fighting before a 2016 peace agreement.
Still, many experts say there are huge differences between the Colombian and Afghan conflicts.
"The idea that we're making the same kind of progress (as in Colombia) is grasping at straws for justification," said Jason Dempsey, an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for New American Security think-tank who deployed twice to Afghanistan.
Nicholson highlighted a grassroots "peace movement," which they said was not aligned to any party in Afghanistan's nearly 17-year-old conflict. They said it has held events in 20 Afghan provinces, calling for ceasefires and peace talks.
"And this has never happened before in Afghanistan, to my knowledge, over 20 provinces," they said.
Asked about how this would affect the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, Nicholson said: "The end state of the policy is to achieve a reconciliation."

During my teens, when I was dealing with anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder, I began seeing a therapist. I went to several over the years, and they helped me develop coping skills and gain control over my mental health. Then, last year, I started seeing a life coach, who helped me figure out the next direction for my career, relationships, and personal development. Both therapists and life coaches have been valuable to me for different things, depending on what I needed in life — which made me wonder, what exactly is the difference between a therapist and a life coach?
"Therapy and coaching both facilitate change in people and assist them with gaining perspective on their problems," Sharon Saline, PsyD, clinical psychologist and author of What Your ADHD Child Wishes You Knew: Working Together to Empower Kids for Success in School and Life, tells Bustle. "They're like cousins, sharing some traits but using different approaches. Therapists take a holistic perspective that includes your overall care — emotional, cognitive, and behavioral health. They must be licensed to practice, following years of university study and internships, in the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health conditions and disorders as classified in the DSM V. Coaches are not mandated to be certified, but many complete courses and training for certification. They rely more on a wellness model aimed at people without significant mental health issues and offer a more educational process."
Wondering which is right for you? Here are a few questions to ask yourself.
1 Are You More Concerned With The Past Or The Future? Andrew Zaeh for Bustle "The predominant difference between a life coach and a therapist is that a therapist works with the past and deep, unresolved emotional pain," Kendra Davies, a coach and owner at Stellar Life Coaching in Orlando, FL, tells Bustle. "Life coaching is a now and future-minded practice which works to identify what is working and what is going well, going from functioning to thriving." So, if you think something from the past is standing in the way of your current goals, you may want to talk to a therapist about it. If you're hoping to figure out your future, a life coach may be more helpful.
2 Are You Dealing With A Mental Illness? Ashley Batz/Bustle Those with mental illnesses can still see life coaches, but they may also want a therapist's help with their mental health. "Therapy is completely appropriate in situations like severe depression, suicidal thoughts, bi-polar disorder, trauma, and assault," says Davies. "Coaching is not a substitute for therapy in these instances. However, in many cases, you can use a coach at the same time, because as a therapist helps you resolve those issues and sets up a treatment plan to address symptoms, a coach can help you build and apply new skills you learn in real time."
3 Can You Function? Hannah Burton/Bustle If you're having trouble working, maintaining relationships, or otherwise functioning in your day-to-day life, a therapist would be best, says Davies. But if you are getting by and want to function even better, go to a life coach.
4 Do You Know What It Is That's Missing? Andrew Zaeh for Bustle A therapist can help you work through a specific problem in your life. But if you have a sense that something's missing in your life but you can't quite put your finger on it, a life coach could help you figure out what it is. "[If] you feel stuck, but you still have self-awareness enough to realize your part in your own stuckness, [see a] life coach," says Davies.
5 Do You Want Actionable Advice? Ashley Batz/Bustle The stereotype of a therapist sitting on a couch and asking "How do you feel about that?" is not entirely off. "As a therapist, I can't always tell my clients what to do," psychotherapist and love/life coach Nikita Banks tells Bustle. "I can guide them in that direction, but the breakthrough comes when they have their own moment of self discovery. This means they can focus on their own healing at their own time and pace. Coaches tell you what to do and hold you accountable."
6 Do You Want Help In One Particular Area? Anton/Fotolia While some therapists are specialized (like couples' therapists), most are holistic, says Banks. Life coaches, on the other hand, are more likely to focus on one particular area. For example, there are career coaches, relationship coaches, and financial coaches. If you primarily want to work on one of those areas, you may prefer a coach who specializes in that area.

ISLAMABAD - Outgoing Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong made a farewell call on Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi at Prime Minister's Office on Friday.
The prime minister commended the services of the outgoing ambassador in further strengthening and deepening the strong bonds of friendship and multi-sector cooperation between Pakistan and China, and in facilitating the smooth and expeditious execution of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects. They observed that Ambassador Sun Weidong had also contributed significantly in expanding people-to-people contacts and collaboration in various areas, ranging from trade and commerce to education and culture. Referring to the conferment of Hilal-i-Pakistan on Sun Weidong, the prime minister said that this award was very prestigious, and shall stand as a testimony of the outstanding performance of the ambassador.
The prime minister also appreciated the work of Bao Jiqing in creating better understanding and affinity between the people of Pakistan and China. Abbasi wished the outgoing ambassador the very best in their future personal and professional life. Ambassador Sun Weidong thanked the prime minister and the Government of Pakistan for extending every possible cooperation in the performance of their diplomatic duties, and said that it had been a privilege for them to serve in Pakistan, and to play their part in further strengthening the time-honoured friendship between the two nations.
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear another fresh petition challenging the prevalent practices of nikah halala and polygamy among Muslims saying it is violative of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
A bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud issued notice on a petition filed by Nazia Elahi Khan, chairperson of a Kolkata-based group called Muslim Women's Resistance Committee. The bench tagged the writ petition with the pending matters on the issues.
Advocate VK Biju, appearing for the group, sought direction for declaring the practices of nikah halala and polygamy under Muslim personal laws as illegal and unconstitutional for being violative of articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the Constitution.
They said that Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, seeks to recognise and validate nikah halala and polygamy, which is void and unconstitutional as such practices are not only repugnant to the basic dignity of a woman as an individual but also violative of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
The petition said that the Muslim personal laws of India permit the practice of nikah halala and polygamy. While polygamy allows a Muslim man to have four wives, nikah halala deals with the process in which a Muslim woman, who wants to re-marry their husband after divorce, has to first marry another person and get a divorce from the second person after the consummation.
"Therefore, this is directly degrading women to a position inferior to that of men and it treats women as a property and which can be used as per their will," it said. The petition further added that "the discrimination between men and women as regards the permission to have multiple spouses grossly offends the right to dignity of women, which is an integral part of the right to life and personal liberty".
The apex court had on 2 July, said that it would consider setting up of a five-judge constitution bench to examine the validity of the practices of polygamy and 'nikah halala'.
The apex court, which on 22 August last year had banned the age-old practice of instant 'triple talaq' among Sunni Muslims, had on 26 March decided to refer to a larger bench a batch of pleas challenging the constitutional validity of polygamy and nikah halala among Muslims.
The top court had said that the petitions challenging the two prevalent practices will be listed for hearing before the constitution bench after the Centre files its response. The Centre recently made it clear that it would oppose in the Supreme Court the practice of nikah halala when the top court would examine its legal validity in the coming days.
The court's observation on 2 July had come on a plea of Delhi-based woman Sameena Begum, seeking an urgent hearing of their petition, alleging they have been threatened by their in-laws to either withdraw the case from the apex court or get thrown out of the matrimonial home.
The top court on 26 March had referred to a five-judge bench the petitions challenging the constitutional validity of polygamy and nikah halala.
It had considered the submission that an earlier five-judge constitution bench, in its 2017 verdict, had kept open the issue of polygamy and nikah halala, while quashing the practice of triple talaq.
It had then issued notices to ministries of Law and Justice and Minority Affairs as well as the National Commission of Women after taking note of the pleas on the issues of polygamy and nikah halala.
Some other petitions have also challenged the practices of nikah mutah and nikah misyar, both temporary marriages where the duration of the relationship is specified and agreed upon in advance.
Vishal's political intentions have caused turmoil within the industry; they now need a new way ahead
Back to back victories of Vishal at South Indian Artists Association (SIAA) and Tamil Film Producers Council(TFPC) gained them enough prominence and acrimony in Tamil cinema. The actor was instrumental in defeating veterans Sarath Kumar (former President of SIIA) and Thanu (former President of TFPC).
Presently, Vishal acts as the President of TFPC and General Secretary of SIAA which makes them as one of the most influential persons in the Tamil film industry. Everything went well for Vishal until they entered into politics by filing nomination at the RK Nagar by-poll. Vishal's stint in politics didn't last long because of the discrepancies found in their nomination papers.
Nevertheless, the actor's political intentions have caused them a huge trouble in the industry.
The General Body meeting of TFPC was held on Sunday under the observation of Retired Judge Ramanathan. The meeting began by honoring veteran producers Muktha Srinivasan, CV Rajendran and Prasad. The controversy started as soon as the organisers played ‘Tamil Thai Vazhthu' (the State song of Tamil Nadu); producer and actor Mansoor Ali Khan objected the state song being played without having the officer bearers on the stage.
It was TFPC's former Treasurer Radhakrishnan who first demanded Vishal's resignation. Radhakrishnan said “TFPC's bylaw says that the council members should have a friendly equation with the State Government. But Vishal recently criticised TN Government and opposed the ruling party at RK Nagar by-poll, their actions led a tense situation. Subsidies to producers has become doubtful now"
Producer Cheran and a few more members supported Radhakrishnan. When Vishal tried to answer back, they aren't allowed and the opposition camp created a hubbub at the meet. When General Secretary proposed to submit the accounts of TFPC, a commotion broke out once again and the organisers ended the meet by playing the National Anthem.
Interacting with the media, Vishal said “Judge Ramanathan monitored all the ruckus happened at the TFPC General Body Meeting. At this juncture, we also thank cops for their protection. A few vested interests allegedly blame us for 7 cr worth corruption but they don't have any proof. Instead of playing the blame game in front of the media, they can come to TFPC's office and prove. TN Government has passed subsidies for 149 films, don't know how they will abolish just because I filed nomination at RK Nagar Constituency. TFPC's bylaw doesn't restrict me or any member from contesting in elections”.
"We have fulfilled our promises in TFPC and SIAA, a new building for the association will be inaugurated by next December. If there is any violation, we would step down but without any basic proof, can't resign," they said.
Cheran, who is believed to be a staunch hater of Vishal, said “I can't reveal the details of what happened at the General Body Meeting. Unlike Vishal, I'm not interested to use media to gain publicity. Vishal failed to respect 409 members, they were scared and abruptly ended the meet. I thought Vishal was a revolutionist but they lost the credibility and shouldn't open their mouth on any issues”.
Senior actor Radikaa also mocked Vishal's statement: “Funny to hear President saying, 'If there is a problem, they should come to the office and discuss not go to press'. Sounds familiar? They who knows nothing about respect or protocol, looks like Jekyll and Hyde."
Another big blow for Vishal is that their friend Ponvanannan, Vice President of SIAA, submitted their resignation on Monday. In a detailed letter sent to Nassar, President of SIAA, Ponvannan said they are resigning only because of Vishal's unannounced political entry.
“When we contested the Nadigar Sangam elections in 2015, it was decided that members who hold high posts in the association shouldn't associate with any political party. When we met late Chief Minister J Jayalalitha, they praised our decision. We were careful to not have any political colour to our association and met various political leaders like Cho Ramasamy, Karunanithi, and Vijayakanth. But when our General Secretary (Vishal) filed nominations at RK Nagar, I was shocked. I agree that anyone who has right to vote can contest in elections but we came to power only by promising that the office bearers will work without any political influence. But the Secretary's political entry is contradicting our ideology”, said Ponvannan.
“Vishal's political ambitions will lead to criticisms on SIAA and I don't want to be answerable for things which I'm not responsible for. Though I regret sending my resignation without completing the assigned duty, I request the executive committee to discuss and accept my resignation," added Ponvannan.
In a reply to Ponvannan, SIAA said that the executive committee registered Ponvannan's thoughts but they have given more time for the actor to reconsider their decision. In the executive meeting, Vishal said they didn't violate the bylaws of the association but promised such situations wouldn't occur in future.
Insiders murmur is that Vishal's political inclination caused turmoil within Tamil Film Producers Council and South Indian Artists Association, and they should now find a new game-plan to tackle the internal politics.
The latest Action Launcher update brings the Pixel 2's newly designed Google Search bar to any of your devices.
Chris Lacey's Action Launcher received a massive update this summer that made the already great Android launcher better than ever with a ton of new Android O-themed features. Just a couple days after Google's unveiling of the Pixel 2, Action Launcher has already been updated to bring one of the phone's most noticeable software changes to your device right now.
With this year's Pixel phones, Google decided to move the search bar to the bottom of the home screen below the dock. The idea here is that this makes accessing search easier than having to stretch your finger all the way to the top of the screen, and it's a subtle change that actually makes a lot of sense. With the new v29.0 update for Action Launcher, you can get that Pixel 2-style search bar without having to hand over $650 or more for Google's new hardware.
Once you've got the new v29.0 update, go to Settings -> Quickbar -> Style. From here, you can select "Search box (dock)" to get the Pixel 2-style search bar right on your home screen.
Since this is the Quickbar after all, you can do much more than change its position. All of the same Quickbar controls are here, including the ability to round the corners of the bar, customize its color, and even add/remove shortcuts for apps and settings. Also new with the v29.0 update, you can now swap out the full "Google" logo in favor of a much simpler "G" design.
Action Launcher and Nova Launcher take different approaches to Adaptive Icons
WEST ALEXANDRIA — On Nov. 7, four ambitious members of Twin Valley South's MVCTC FFA chapter suited up in official dress and headed to St. Mary's to compete in the District Job Interview CDE.
These members were Tazia Blaylock, Ben Bittner, Chyann Kendal, and Kallen Pitz.
This contest is designed to simulate a real world employee hiring process. The contestants have to apply for a job. These jobs can range from engineering to being a dog walker. They are to create a cover letter, resume, and fill out an application. Contestants also go through the interviewing process.
They are judged on how they respond to questions, how they introduce themselves, and communication skills. TVS members did extremely well in this competition. This was Ben Bittner, Tazia Blaylock, and Kallen Pitz' first time competing in the Job Interview CDE.
Each member competed against 18 or more students in their grade level for who had the best cover letter, resume, employment application and personal interview. Bittner placed 8th out of 18 students in the Freshman division, Pitz placed ninth out of 24 in the Sophomore student division, Blaylock placed 9th in the Junior division out of 22, and Chyann placed first out of 23 students.
Chyann advanced to the State Contest on Saturday, Dec. 2 to represent our district.

Disney will certainly fight hard against the living wage ordinance; just a couple of years ago, it got its allies on the Anaheim City Council to pass a rule to prohibit any sort of gate tax for up to 45 years. It will spend millions in the coming months to argue that the living-wage proposal will only benefit union members rather than all Anaheim residents. That's technically true. But it's also telling that Anaheim residents are ready to penalize Disneyland for its perceived sins against the working class and local taxpayers.

We're getting towards the business end of the Champions League now. Over the next two nights, eight teams will become four, the final chancers weeded out.
In three of the quarter-finals, one team is clearly well placed to progress: Juventus have one foot in the next round after clobbering Barcelona in Turin, while both Monaco and Real Madrid will be expecting to get the job done after victories away from home.
Then there's Leicester vs Atletico Madrid. On paper, Diego Simeone's battle-hardened side are the pick, yet the Foxes defied expectations against Sevilla and are still very much in the tie after a narrow first-leg defeat.
Here are five key storylines ahead of the week's matches:
Morgan return a timely boost for Leicester

Playing Atletico in the Champions League knockout stages is a tough ask at the best of times. Simeone's charges have made a habit of getting the job done when the stakes are highest: Atleti have won seven of their last eight ties between group stage and final, their only defeat coming against Real Madrid in an attritional 2015 quarter-final.
But to do so without both of your first choice centre-backs? Now that would be a thankless task. Lucky for Leicester, then, that Wes Morgan looks to have recovered sufficiently from a back problem to replace Robert Huth, who serves a suspension after a booking at the Calderon. "My eyes tell me that we should be fairly pleased with how he's come through," said Craig Shakespeare, who will make their final decision today.
Clearly, Shakespeare would love to call on both Huth and Morgan – Leicester's win percentage with the pair is 37 per cent this season, compared to 25 per cent when one or both are absent – but their captain's leadership and experience will be invaluable alongside Yohan Benalouane, who has deputised with some aplomb over the last six weeks.
Neutrals might have been licking their lips at the prospect of Marcin Wasilewski lumbering around in Antoine Griezmann's slipstream, but Morgan's return is undoubtedly excellent news for the Foxes.
Bavaria eggs in Lewandowski's basket

Bayern Munich are also hoping that the return of a key man will be the catalyst for a second-leg revival on Tuesday night. The Bavarians welcome back Robert Lewandowski, whose absence with a shoulder injury has coincided with a worrying dip in form: the 2-1 defeat to Real Madrid in Munich was followed by stalemate against Bayer Leverkusen at the weekend, meaning they have now won just one of their last four games in all competitions.
Crisis talk is never far away at the Allianz Arena and a manager as experienced as Carlo Ancelotti will be well aware that defeat at the Bernabeu would plunge the club – and their flight attendantship – into the mire. Discounting the victory over Borussia Dortmund, recent displays have been oddly anodyne, and Bayern's cause will hardly be helped if Mats Hummels and Jerome Boateng fail late fitness tests in Spain.
Amid such uncertainty, Lewandowski stands out as Bavaria's great white hope. The Pole had struck 15 goals in 11 games before injury, leading the line with the kind of conviction the out-of-sorts Thomas Muller has not been able to muster in the last fortnight. Lewandowski also has form against Real Madrid, of course, having hit four in a thrilling Dortmund win over Los Merengues in 2013.
Ancelotti certainly seems hopeful that the 28-year-old will make the difference. "It will help us that Lewandowski can play," the former said on Monday. "He is a super player, a top goalscorer and that gives us more confidence."
Isco inferno can fire Real

Madrid will be without Gareth Bale against Bayern, but that's not necessarily such bad news for Zinedine Zidane. For the Welshman's likely replacement, Isco, put in a gala display at the weekend, scoring two fine goals in the 3-2 win over Sporting Gijon. The 24-year-old has only played 77 minutes of football in this Champions League campaign, but they look to be coming to the boil at just the right time.
Dortmund plotting course through emotional storm
The modern football calendar rarely allows for quiet reflection at the best of times. It's both a marathon and a sprint, broadcast at full blast, 24 hours a day. Little surprise, then, that when unforeseen events come crashing into the picture, as they did in last Tuesday's mindless attack on the Borussia Dortmund team coach, basic human decency gets pushed somewhere to the bottom of the pile of priorities.
Dortmund's players were in no fit state to play Monaco on Wednesday night. How could they be? It was clear from their performance and the outpouring of emotion after the match that they were at Westfalenstadion in body, but not in spirit. Marc Bartra, of course, was not there at all: they watched from their hospital bed after bearing the brunt of the explosion.

Some semblance of normality was restored at the weekend in the form of a 3-1 win over Eintracht Frankfurt, but again, the event was charged. Players held up a Bartra shirt at the end of the game and post-match interviews underlined the toll that the last week has taken on the squad. “It hasn't improved for all of us,” said left-back Marcel Schmelzer, while goalkeeper Roman Burki admitted that they still struggle to sleep through the night.
The Black and Yellows will be eyeing a dramatic turnaround against Monaco on Wednesday, but really their biggest battle in the weeks ahead is against the demons lingering after last week's explosion. Anyone with a heart will wish them luck.
Barcelona dreaming of second miracle

"We can do it. We did it once and we can do it a second time. We have to give our absolute maximum. If everything goes well, there will be another comeback. I believe in the team and in our power. Everything is [already] lost, so we have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
So said Neymar to the Brazilian press on Monday, in an admirable display of positive thinking. But the reality is that Barcelona will need a miracle even bigger than the one that took them through to the quarter-finals, for Juventus are a far more savvy outfit than the Paris Saint-Germain side that managed to complete just three passes in the time that Barça scored their last three goals on that fateful night at the Camp Nou.
Is it possible? Yes, of course. But they'll need to be at their very best, hope Juventus have a absolute stinker, and pray for another insanely generous referee. It looks like a lot to ask, even for them.

Superstar Aishwarya Rai Bachchan needs no introduction. Suffice it to say that the actor and former Miss World is a global icon, having made a mark with their breath-taking beauty, stunning red carpet looks and blockbuster movies.
But despite being so famous, few people know of Aishwarya's secret talent for singing.
An old video of the Ae Dil Hai Mushkil actor singing has recently emerged and left us in awe. The 1998 clip, from an episode of Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai shows its host, late actor Farooq Sheikh, asking Aishwarya to sing a few lines after their co-actor Chandrachur Singh tells the audience that they have a hidden talent
Incredibly nervous, they begin singing and immediately impresses the audience with their melodious voice. They break into giggles many times as they sing a rendition of Meri Saanson Mein Basa Hai from film Aur Pyaar Ho Gaya.

Automotive recall announcements keep bubbling in the news cycle, and although it might be easier to simply ignore them, the Takata airbag recall is one that demands your attention. According to USA Today, improperly inflating Takata airbags have resulted in the deaths of 21 people worldwide and injuries to more than 180. The issue: The chemical propellant designed to rapidly inflate the airbags can degrade over time, especially in hot and humid climates, causing the propellant to ignite too quickly and rupture its metal container, sending shrapnel toward vehicle occupants.
Just before we went to press for our April print issue, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration and several auto manufacturers announced an additional 1.2 million vehicles affected by these defective airbag inflators. This brings the total number of vehicles affected to more than 42 million, with 69 million airbag inflators affected.
This is one of the largest and most complicated automotive recalls in history. So what should you do? Find your smartphone, tablet, or computer, and point your web browser to nhtsa.gov/recalls. Then get your vehicle registration, or wander to the front of your car's windshield on the driver's side, and locate the 17-digit Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). Tapping this number into the site's VIN checking field will let you know whether your car has defective airbags (or other outstanding recalls) and needs to be serviced. Additional resources, including more details on the recall and on how to get your vehicle fixed, are also on the site.
Checking your VIN is free, and if your vehicle has a defective airbag, getting it repaired at your local dealer is also free. Anyone who tells you differently is flat-out wrong; if it's someone in the service department, the dealer principal needs to be informed immediately, along with the manufacturer they or they represent, the Better Business Bureau, and NHTSA.
It bears repeating that more than 42 million vehicles are affected, covering 19 manufacturers and some 34 brands at this point. On the affected vehicle list is everything from the 2002 Toyota Sequoia to the 2017 McLaren 570S, so if you think you and your loved ones are probably fine, you're taking an unnecessary risk. Maybe you don't have a car on the list, but how about the co-worker you go to lunch with or the neighbor in the carpool with your kids? Have teenagers? What are their friends driving? Probably something a few years old. Even ask your Lyft driver if they or they have had it checked (those people love to talk). Sounds funny, but the risk is real.
Several manufacturers have expressed concerns to us about how, despite concerted efforts, getting vehicle owners in for this vital service has been exceedingly difficult—particularly for older models purchased on the second-hand market because car companies and their dealers lose the ability to follow up with new owners.
And the recall numbers are only going to go up. Given the size and complexity of the problem, NHTSA has rolled out the recall in phases that started in May 2016, with updates at the end of each December. The final phase is scheduled for December 31, 2019, at which point all affected vehicles will be identified and recalled.
Until then, check early, and check often at www.nhtsa.gov/recalls.

One of the biggest trades that went down in recent Toronto Maple Leafs history involved moving perennial 30 goal scorer Phil Kessel. The team was under new management and the priority was to get younger and start to acquire assets for the future.
Kessel didn't fit the bill. They were shipped to the Pittsburgh Penguins, where they flourished in the playoffs and eventually won themselves a Stanley Cup. The main pieces the Leafs got in return were talented forward, Kasperi Kapanen and defenceman, Scott Harrington, along with a couple of draft picks.
Harrington wasn't consistent enough on the blueline and is no longer with the organization. Kapanen, on the other hand, has spent time with the Marlies, matured their game and is playing a huge role in clutch situations for the Leafs.
Finnish Maturity
When Kapanen came over to to the Marlies initially, they looked a bit out of place. In fairness to him, being traded from one organization to another is usually a huge shock. In their first year with the Toronto Marlies, the Leafs AHL affiliate, they had 25 points in 44 games. These are respectable numbers for a young forward learning their way in the pro game.
They were also one of the prospects the Leafs called up near the end of the season. They wanted to get a sense of what they had kicking around in the system. It was a great audition for the likes of William Nylander, Zach Hyman, and Connor Brown, all of whom have graduated to the big club this year.
Kasperi Kapanen has been in the NHL for 10 games this year and he's scored:
– game-tying goal vs. PIT
– game-tying goal in Game 2
– 2OT GWG — Future Of The Six (@FutureOfThe6) April 16, 2017
Kapanen looked great as well. They played in nine games and while they didn't record a point, their speed gave opponents fits all game long.
Over the summer, Kapanen worked hard and was determined to come to the Marlies and show what they were capable of. The results were staggering, as Kapanen was a point per game player in the AHL. They were also injured for a large portion of the season which makes their turnaround even more impressive.
Kapanen is an interesting combination of skills. He's a great penalty killer and can handle themselves on the defensive side of the puck. The Finn is also offensively gifted and has been able to score some massive goals. More on this later. Their greatest asset is without a doubt their speed.
Kapanen can absolutely fly and uses their speed offensively and defensively to help them overwhelm their opponents. Combine this with their other skills and Kapanen is as solid a prospect as they come in the Leafs organization.
Kappy is Clutch
Leafs fans are well aware that their team had been battling it out for the playoffs for the majority of the season. It was a situation that the young Leafs didn't think they'd find themselves in so soon, but they made their own luck and are now entrenched in a battle against the Washington Capitals.
Before they clinched, however, they were having some trouble closing the deal. This was a consistent problem they fought to solve throughout the season as the young team learned what it takes to succeed.
In the last four games of the regular season, the Leafs had a chance to punch their ticket to the postseason. They lost to both the Capitals and Tampa Bay Lightning before facing the Penguins on the last Saturday night of the season.
The Leafs were trailing 3-2 late in the third before Kapanen found themselves in the right place to send home their first career NHL goal. This goal couldn't have come at a better time and was the driving force in the Leafs comeback, which saw them take the game 5-3 in regulation.
Now into the playoffs, the Leafs needed a hero in overtime against the Capitals. Kapanen had already scored once in the game and ended up securing the win for Toronto off a slick pass from Brian Boyle. This goal gave the Leafs the split in Washington and the momentum heading back home for games three and four.
Kapanen has a history of scoring huge goals, as they were the overtime hero against Russia during the gold medal match of the 2016 World Junior Championship. They scored the wraparound goal that allowed Finland to win the gold on home ice.
The Leafs insisted on Kasperi Kapanen being a part of the deal with the Penguins. A few years later and it looks like the management team was right to insist. Kapanen is young and improving every year and should fit right into the Leafs system of talented players.
Fans can count on the young Finn playing a large role in the playoffs and really coming into their own next season where he's basically a lock to make the big club out of training camp. Their contribution will surely add to the Leafs' impressive youth movement.

LONDON (Reuters) - As the days tick down towards closure of the transfer window, millions of pounds worth of soccer talent is sitting idle in a series of high-stake standoffs.
Southampton's Virgil van Dijk, Chelsea's Diego Costa and Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson all failed to turn out for their contracted employer on the opening day of the Premier League season and hope to trade up before August 31.
Meanwhile, Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho is sidelined with what the club said was a back injury after handing in a transfer request intended to force a move to Barcelona against the Reds' wishes.
All four players are under contract, the golden handcuffs traditionally used to tie them to their clubs. But the modern footballer is challenging such restraints, a trend the transfer window, with its artificial timeframe, exacerbates.
Earlier this year Dimitri Payet forced a move after refusing to play for West Ham United in the last window. The club eventually reluctantly sold them to to Olympique Marseille.
Costa, who is in Brazil rather than with their Chelsea teammates, is adopting a similar strategy. In a newspaper interview on Monday, the striker threatened to sit out, unpaid if necessary, the remaining two years on their contract if Chelsea do not allow them to move.
Costa's legal representative has reportedly threatened action citing possible discrimination, although one British sports contract expert contacted by Reuters doubted if such an action would succeed.
"For a repudiation breach (of contract) Chelsea would have had to stop paying their wages, singled them out or bullied him. They won't make that sort of bad move," Richard Cramer of FrontRow Legal told Reuters.
"But they might still sell them because a manager does not want a disillusioned player, so player power is very strong."
DOWNING TOOLS
Discontent is not restricted to specific clubs. Like Coutinho, Van Dijk has also handed in a transfer request and was left out of Southampton's opening day Premier League game with Swansea City, who also omitted Sigurdsson, their star midfielder of last year, as talks continue over a possible move to Everton.
Such situations are nothing new in football. Back in 1961, one of England's greatest players, Stanley Matthews, was told by Blackpool "you forget, as a player, we made you" when they agitated for a move that would double their wages to Stoke City, while West Ham United stopped Bobby Moore from moving to Tottenham Hotspur within months of theirs captaining England to their 1966 World Cup win.
However, players downing tools, like Payet and Costa, is a more modern phenomenon linked to Fifa's introduction of the harmonised transfer window in the 2002-03 season.
Before then, players could switch clubs in England at any time until March each year, a cut-off point intended to safeguard competition at the business end of the season.
Ironically, the change was introduced as part of a compromise agreement with the European Commission to enhance contractual stability, but increasingly the reverse seems the case, with both Coutinho and Van Dijk now seeking moves within months of agreeing multi-year contract extensions.
Liverpool's Steve Gerrard is among those believing that, in Coutinho's case, a red line may have been crossed.
"This is a huge test for the club from top to bottom. They have just signed a five-year deal, The least they can do is give them another year," they told BT Sport.
The problem, Gerrard admits, is that even if Coutinho agrees such a compromise, there is no guarantee Barcelona will return next year. "Barcelona will have been saying to their representatives 'it's now or never'."
Many observers believe the window should close before the season starts, a suggestion the Premier League is happy to lobby for.
"The problem is we operate in a European, and often a global market, so while they might be happy that the window closed in England they would be less happy to see their Spanish, German or Italian rivals continue to trade," a spokesperson said.
The League has offered to raise the issue with the European Club Association and European Professional Football League, but change appears unlikely and so the unseemly conflict between players and clubs will look set to continue until the window slams shut, probably with a huge sense of relief all round.
The Professional Footballers' Association declined a request for an interview.

Months after the search for a missing Australian woman was suspended, Whistler RCMP has confirmed their remains have been found and identified.
Alison Raspa was first reported missing on Nov. 23, hours after they were last seen leaving a Whistler bar, but multiple searches found no trace of the 25-year-old.
Police say they were alerted at around 7:30 Friday night to the discovery of human remains within Alpha Lake. Crews confirmed the remains were found in the north end of the lake, which was partially frozen.

The BC Coroners Service confirmed to police over the weekend that the remains were those of Raspa.
Police say the cause of death has not been determined, but it does not appear suspicious. An investigation is ongoing in cooperation with Raspa's family in Australia, who have been notified of their discovery.

Witnesses say they last saw Raspa leaving the Three Below Bar on Blackcomb Way just before midnight on Nov. 22, and they were reported missing by co-workers the next day.
They reportedly got on public transit and ended up in Alpha Lake Park. A text message from Raspa to their friends around 1:15 a.m. said they were lost.

A personal item was found in Alpha Lake Park on the morning of Nov. 23. Multiple search and rescue crews, including dive teams, searched the lake and the surrounding park for Raspa for nearly two weeks before calling off the search.
Australian news reports at the time said Raspa was from Perth and moved to Canada in May of last year. They were working at a Whistler hotel at the time they disappeared.
Police are asking anyone with more information about Raspa and the events of the night they disappeared to contact them immediately.

Cast once again in the role of interpreter of President Trump's comments, Vice President Mike Pence is touring Latin America and attempting to dispel their boss' threat of military action against Venezuela.
Trump on Friday said they would not "rule out" a "military option" to confront the crisis in Venezuela, where the increasingly authoritarian practices of leftist President Nicolas Maduro have touched off waves of deadly political violence and humanitarian disaster.
Trump's threat was roundly decried in Latin America just as Pence headed out for a weeklong, four-nation tour on Sunday.
Speaking at a news conference late Sunday with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos in the coastal city of Cartagena, Pence said Trump spoke with "resolve" but still wants a peaceful solution.
"President Trump is a leader who says what they mean and means what they say, but the president sent me here to continue to marshal the unprecedented support of countries across Latin America to achieve by peaceable means the restoration of democracy in Latin America, and we believe it is achievable by those means." Pence said.
"You hear in President Trump's words the resolve of the United States of America to see this through, to restore democracy and constitutional government in Venezuela," they added.
Most of Latin America has been united in efforts to pressure the Maduro government and to back economic sanctions imposed by the United States against Maduro and several of their associates.
Several Latin American countries have even said they would consider sanctions of their own. Until recently, much of Latin America was reluctant to appear to be intervening in a neighbor's internal affairs, especially at Washington's behest.
But oil-rich Venezuela now appears on the verge of collapse, which would send refugees fleeing to other parts of Latin America and cause regional turmoil.
Pence spoke alongside Santos, who sternly warned that no country in Latin America would support U.S. military action.
"I told the vice president that the possibility of military intervention in Venezuela should not be considered," Santos said.

“Electrifying transportation is a priority for Santa Clara. We will use the grant to prepare our city and our utility for a future increasingly leveraging EVs for their many economic and environmental benefits,” said John Roukema, Chief Electric Utility Officer, Silicon Valley Power.
“The strategic plan will be developed using Siemens' EV-Implementation Framework (EV-IF), a technical approach that Siemens designed to catalyze electro-mobility at the community level. As part of the engagement, Siemens will also leverage its global learnings from the manufacture, deployment, and operation of EV chargers for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles; make-ready electrical equipment; and charging management software. Siemens also brings its expertise in integrating turn-key solutions for utility EV charging and grid infrastructure, critical elements in preparing EV-ready communities,” said Chris King, Chief Policy Officer for Siemens Digital Grid.
Throughout the project, Siemens and the City of Santa Clara/Silicon Valley Power will collaborate to apply learnings from the local, national, and global level to guide the blueprint. The plan will employ a strategic approach that starts with long-term electrification targets and develops a roadmap that lays out, step-by-step, how those targets will be achieved. In addition, the partnership will identify benefits for commercial stakeholders through the integration of successful EV business models, thereby supporting access to finance.
The available grant funding, a portion of which has also been awarded to other teams, represents the first phase of a two-step process. Once the blueprints have been completed, awardees will have the opportunity to submit their completed plans to compete for implementation funding.
Siemens Digital Grid and the City of Santa Clara/Silicon Valley Power intend to kick off the assignment within the next few weeks, and to complete the work within 12 months.
The organization behind MyEtherWallet is planning to release an official version of its popular cryptocurrency wallet for iOS after Apple removed a knockoff that had been in the App Store for around a week.
The unofficial version of the open source software, which is used to hold ETH and other alt coins outside of bitcoin, got as high as number three in the financial section of the App Store thanks to a crypto boom fueled by the continued rise in value of bitcoin, which blew past $17,000 last week. The same wave saw Coinbase hit the top spot for overall downloads in the U.S..
The now-removed iOS app was priced at $4.99 and it had been downloaded around 3,000 times, according to estimates from Apptopia.
The good news for users of MyEtherWallet is that the company has plans to introduce an official app. A representative told TechCrunch that an iOS app is currently in development.

Motorists who get tickets from Michigan State Police will be able to pay them online at 36th District Court through the new Online Ticket Resolution Program, court officials announced Wednesday.
The initiative is a quicker and more efficient method to take care of the tickets than having to appear in court for a hearing. The program only applies to “eligible” civil citations given out by MSP officers.
“Individuals will have the option to request consideration for a plea offer to a lesser or no point violation by answering a few simple questions, according to a press release from court officials Wednesday.
“A Magistrate will review the individual's eligibility and driving record, applying the same criteria as an in-person court appearance, and provide a response within 72 hours. The party will then have the opportunity to accept or reject the offer.”
The program is an alternative developed using technology as part of the court's commitment to accessibility and other services to the public, court officials say.
“We are confident that the citizens we serve will find the new online program beneficial and time-saving and we encourage them to take advantage of this new, convenient service. We look forward to continued technological improvements and offering better services to the public” said Chief Judge Nancy M. Blount of 36th District Court.

Islamabad-The protestors at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) forced out the Vice Chancellor (VC) of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU) from their office and locked their room, on Friday.
The strike held by PIMS employees to demand the separation of the hospital from the university, to secure the civil servant structure, entered its sixth day with a deadlock on both sides. Dozens of protestors led by PIMS doctors, paramedical staff and general employees association entered the administration block and cordoned the office of VC Prof Dr Javed Akram. The protestors chanted slogans outside the VC office and asked them to leave their seat.
After negotiations, VC Dr Javed Akram left their office amid screaming protestors. PIMS employees continued their protest till mid of the day.
Several fruitless rounds of negotiations between Capital Administration & Development Division (CADD) and PIMS employees have already been held.
The strike is affecting services at the hospital because the Outdoor Patient Departments (OPDs), clinical services and scheduled surgeries have been suspended. Around five hundred surgeries have been cancelled in the main operation theatre, children hospital, MCH and burn center in the last five days. Only the emergency services are functional.
PIMS and SZABMU were merged through the Act of parliament in 2013. Last year, CADD moved a summary to Prime Minister (PM) to separate the two entities.
Meanwhile, a number of patients visiting PIMS daily have also reduced because of continuous strike at the facility.
Dr Waseem Khawaja, talking to The Nation, said that the patients from nearby areas are not visiting the hospital as the services are not being provided. Those who are unaware of the strike are still visiting.
Meanwhile spokesperson CADD Attique-ur-Rehman said that minister CADD Tariq Fazal Chaudhary held a meeting with law minister Zahid Hamid and discussed the proposed bill.
They said that CADD has moved the summary to law ministry, while the Law minister directed to forward the summary to PM for approval.
The minister vowed to separate both entities a soon as possible.
VC SZABMU said that separation of PIMS and SZABMU is a legal matter and only the government has the authority to implement a decision on it.
“First priority in the hospital is patients and they have been suffering due to the strike,” they said.

This photo shows Jack Cooley, who retired from McDermott in Morgan City and died recently in Mississippi at age 91. Relatives say "Louisiana Jack" was a very passionate and super-competitive drag racer. In 1961, they were the four-state champion with a street-legal car, a 1957 Chevrolet called “Black Trash.” They also went on to own seven or more Chevrolets, which were all known as “Black Trash.” They were inducted into the Louisiana Drag Racers Hall of Fame in 1985 and the Old Time Drag Racers Hall of Fame in 2002. Their obituary appears on Page 12 in this edition and at StMaryNow.com.

CES is here to excite, entice ... and sometimes disappoint.
This is the biggest trade show of the year, taking place in over 2 million square feet of exhibition space across multiple convention centers in Las Vegas and welcoming over 150,000 industry members and media. CES starts off the year with a bang and floods us with more technology than any single person can manage to see.
Though there is a huge media component to the show and many companies use it as a launch point for new products, its importance for many of the biggest companies in the mobile world has faded. Long gone are the days of seeing five or 10 different high-end phones and tablets launched in the span of four days — instead the big names we know are more interested in releasing mid-range devices to save the big ones for independent events.
Sure you won't see the all of 2017's greatest phones unveiled at CES, but there's still a whole lot to get excited about in the mobile world and beyond. Here's what you can expect from CES 2017.
What to expect at CES
When it comes to Android and mobile news, CES is no longer the big show for all of the big announcements. Instead, we get a wider range of interesting news from more companies in more areas.
Phones
When it comes to phones, expect mid-range models and lots of offerings from the lesser-known names. Many of the big names skip CES when it comes to phones, but some companies use this opportunity to show off things they've already launched elsewhere in the world or to bring a small subset to the North American market. Names like Huawei and Xiaomi will have a more notable presence, while more household names like Sony and LG will devote a small portion of their overall corporate appearance at the show.
Chromebooks and tablets
On a slightly different level, many of the big names will be at CES showcasing their latest lineup of laptops and tablets — which nowadays usually include Chromebook and Android versions of their Windows devices, sometimes with a one-off distinct model for each OS. Companies like HP, Dell, ASUS, Acer and Lenovo could have Chromebook models to show off at CES, and those that are still making tablets may have an Android tablet or two to show off. These products don't usually get their own events through the year, so CES turns becomes a good time to show them off.
Virtual reality
CES 2017 is going to be a big show for VR, from the top makers like Oculus and HTC showing off their current headsets all the way down to small companies getting in on the phone-based VR fun. Expect to see a venerable truckload of different takes on the face-mounted holder for your phone, hoping to undercut the likes of the Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream View headsets. You'll see lots of headsets that come in cheaper but purport to offer more features, and not all of them will be explicit Daydream headsets. You'll see some proprietary solutions that are fully contained units running Android, though the operating system itself isn't very important in those.
Wearables
There's a shot that we may see an early look at new Android Wear watches at the show, depending on how far along Google is in its release of Android Wear 2.0 and what manufacturers have finished announcing. Google won't be showing off its two reported smartwatches just yet, but others may get out ahead of the announcement with some info at the very least.
Beyond Android, expect other makers like Xiaomi, Fossil and Garmin to be showing off their latest watches and fitness trackers. Fitbit and Samsung have already released their big products, so don't expect anything new from either one.
Accessories
Then there are the accessories. Every company under the sun will have headphones, speakers, cables, cases, screen protectors, adapters, chargers, batteries and so much more to show off. It can be tough to get through all of it, but there are usually one or two shining new products out of CES that are worth checking out. Unfortunately most aren't worth your time or won't ever make their way to market.
Everything else
TVs. So many TVs. Samsung, LG and Sony will continue to fight not only in picture quality, but in "smart" features. Samsung has its own Tizen platform, LG has webOS and Sony has Android TV.
Internet of Things will once again be massive. Everything in your home will be demonstrated as a connected device, most of the time with questionable usefulness.
Android Auto will surely be on display once again as more carmakers roll out their 2018 models. Don't expect every car to offer it just yet, though — there are still lots of proprietary systems out there.
What not to expect
As I explained from the start, CES is no longer the show where the big names in mobile come to duke it out with their year-leading announcements. We won't see the Galaxy S8 or LG G6 or HTC's latest flagship at the show, nor will we even see mid-range announcements from every manufacturer. Sometimes a company will catch us by surprise with a nicer-than-expected phone announcement here, but the past few years haven't been blockbusters.
Beyond that, it's worth noting before we head into another CES that not everything shown at the show is market-ready and consumer focused. Much of what you'll see coming out of CES are products that are unfinished, components of larger future products or pie-in-the-sky concepts that may never see the light of day. While products shown off at CES can be a great way to see where companies are headed, not everything on display at the show will eventually be available for purchase.

Twelve people have died and more are feared dead after the huge fire which destroyed a tower block in west London.
Flames tore through the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in north Kensington overnight, leaving people trapped on upper floors - some holding babies out of windows and others jumping from their
flats.
Some bodies have been removed from the smouldering remains of the building, which contains 120 flats thought to be home to between 400 and 600 people.
Commander Stuart Cundy of the Metropolitan Police said: "Sadly I can confirm that there are now 12 people that have died that we know of.
"This is going to be a long and complex recovery operation and I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase beyond those 12."
Fire crews are continuing to tackle "pockets of fire" in the building with many people still unaccounted for.
Steve Apter, director of safety and assurance at London Fire Brigade, said: "I can confirm I have had firefighters manage to get through particularly arduous conditions up to the top floor."
London Fire Brigade said it had rescued 65 people from the building.
Mr Cundy added: "Whilst we may have accessed every floor that is not the same as a full search of the whole building, and as I said while we currently sadly have 12 fatalities, I do
believe that figure will rise and sadly I don't anticipate that there will be further survivors."
NHS England said 74 patients were treated in six hospitals across London. Thirty four patients remain in hospital including 18 who are in critical care.

CLAYTON — The City of Clayton has kicked off its 2018 ‘Curb and Street Program.'
R.A. Miller, the city contractor, began replacing curb this week on Rushleigh, Kinsey, Oakfield, Dominican, Pugliese, Lempco and Pineland. Next week work will begin Glen Hills, Baldwin Hills and Sunny Hills.
The curb replacement work is being performed ahead of scheduled street resurfacing. The work consists of a $6 million dollar project over three years that will resurface 67 lane miles of local roads and 15 lane miles of arterial roads.
The first step of this project is to repair or replace damaged curb, gutters and driveway approaches. Residents whose properties are in need of one or more of these repairs will receive a letter detailing what needs to be repaired or replaced. Once the repairs are completed, the street paving program will follow.
The project will continue through September. The concrete and catch basin replacement is already under way and will be completed in July, followed by the resurfacing portion of the project which will be completed in September. Forty roads are involved in this year's program and 28 of those roads are located in the Northmoor and Carriage Hills plats (Seville from Taywood to Union and Valleybrook to Old Salem Roads). The other 12 roads are in the Savina Hills neighborhood. The total cost of the concrete project is estimated at $1.8 million and the paving at $1.2 million.
In addition to the resurfacing project, over the past three years the Service Department has been busy with additional projects improving the Clayton community. These projects include: 105-ADA ramps have been installed, 55 in 2017. The majority of all the ramps have been paid for through local grants including Community Development Block Grant funding from Montgomery County. Clayton will be applying for another grant in 2018, which if awarded, should complete all the needed ADA ramp installations within the city's boundaries.
Clayton also secured a $190,438 grant from Miami Valley Regional Planning Commission to resurface a 2.25-mile stretch of Hoke Road in 2019.
Please be patient during construction and if you have any concerns or questions, please contact Public Service Director Randy Sanders at (937) 836-3500.

TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japan's mammoth Government Pension Investment Fund sold a net 52 billion yen ($475 million) of domestic equities in the fourth quarter as stocks surged to their highest level in a quarter of a century, a Reuters calculation based on the fund's results showed on Friday.
That marked the GPIF's largest quarterly net selling of domestic stocks since it revamped its investment strategy in 2014 by doubling its equities allocation and reducing its reliance on domestic bonds. It had sold a net 20 billion yen worth of Japanese shares in July-September 2016.
The GPIF does not report specific buying or selling amounts but Reuters calculated the figures by comparing investment amounts and asset revenue with those from the previous quarter.
A GPIF spokesperson declined to comment on the reason for selling.
Still, the fund's Japanese stock holdings reached a new peak of 26.05 percent of its total assets of 162.7 trillion yen, compared with 24.35 percent at end-September.
The Nikkei 225 stock average gained 12 percent during the quarter and in November touched its highest level since January 1992. It has extended gains and is up about 2 percent in the year to date.
As stocks also charged ahead globally, the GPIF earned a 3.92 percent return, or a 6 trillion yen gain, on its total investment in the fourth quarter, the fund said.
Its Japanese stock portfolio achieved an 8.68 percent return and its foreign stock portfolio earned 5.65 percent.
The pension fund allocated 27.67 percent to domestic bonds, 14.13 percent to foreign bonds, and 25.08 percent to foreign stocks. The remaining 7.06 percent was held mainly in cash. ($1 = 109.6600 yen) (Reporting by Takashi Umekawa; Editing by Chris Gallagher)
French feminist and writer Helene Cixous began their essay, 'Writing Blind', part of their 1998 collection, Stigmata, with an observation about how solar daylight blinds them to the visionary day. It is only when they are “behind” their eyelids that they can be elsewhere, “no longer of this political world.” It is in that other light that they write. “When I close my eyes the passage opens, the dark gorge, I descend. Or rather there is descent: I entrust myself to the primitive space, I do not resist the forces that carry me off. There is no more genre. I become a thing with pricked-up ears. Night becomes a verb. I night.”
Cixous' insights about the potency of willful darkness are echoed in artist Amar Kanwar's latest film, Such a Morning. The 85-minute long film produced for documenta14 is an allegory of the times we live in, where darkness is systemic and endemic. The protagonist, an ageing mathematics professor, decides to leave their university position to inhabit an abandoned railway carriage in anticipation of the onset of blindness, much to their colleagues' suspicion. The cinematically delicious film seduces the viewer with its arresting visuals and its easily accessible narrative arc, encouraging you to stay riveted despite the strategic absence of dialogue. How does one transcend the darkness of the times we live in is the central premise of Kanwar's film, the consequence, they believe, of their own decision to temporarily withdraw from the political scenarios unraveling both at home and in the world, thus an embodiment of the literal and symbolic closing of their own eyes, so to speak.
Kanwar was invited by Khoj International Artists' Association, New Delhi, to speak about the impulses that led them to make their film that was shown at Kassel and Athens as part of documenta14. They shared with Firstpost the transcripts of their talk at the session titled 'Who Sings the Nation State?' on day two of Khoj's Asia Assemble seminar at Max Mueller Bhavan, New Delhi, from 17 to 19 November, 2017.
**
I begin, with some of the impulses that lead me to make the film, Such a Morning, my most recent film. I will also try and weave in a few responses to the previous discussions about imagining a new Asia, the Chinese One Road One Belt scheme and understanding the nation state.
I'm grateful to Yawnghwe Office in Exile, for reminding us about the civil war; the democracy movement in Burma that has inspired generations of people. Almost four generations in the student movements. What does it mean to fight such a brutal state, year after year, continuously for five-six decades? It is very hard to understand from the outside.
If I look at Gaza, for the last several years, stuck between a maze of walls and the sea, under occupation, under Israel, under Hamas, a prison inside a prison inside a prison... how does one analyse such a condition anymore?
Looking at the cycle of horror in Syria in the last two years and in Yemen now, and again it's hard to find a satisfactory analysis and move on. Of course it is quite obvious that the list of brutalities by the State is a long one and everyone can keep adding to it. Not only in the past 30 to 40 years, but also just in the last five years. This list continues to grow, and gets more and more gruesome.
Looking back at India as a nation state, its birth in 1947, and the execution of its imagination subsequently, again it's hard not to see that it has been accompanied by large-scale violence at every stage.
The scale and the spectrum of violence has been so widespread that it's difficult to get a sense of it. When you live in such a situation where you cannot see all the parts of the violence, some of it becomes continuously invisible and the rest of the violence becomes normal, you come to terms with it, you accept it, you forget, you adjust, you live with it.
And then sometimes you suddenly get an insight.
I remember one instance in rural South Orissa while filming, it was in the late 1990s. I came across a tarmac road that began from nowhere and went nowhere. Nobody could figure out why this road was made. Some said it was to connect rural tribal markets with the city, but the road made no practical sense. People eventually stopped wondering and talking about it, but 10 years later, the rationale for the road became clear, as it perfectly connected two parts of an industrial mining complex.
What kind of modern State was this that could conceive of a deception 10 to 15 years in advance? This was not about acquiring a small plot of land. This was about taking over entire hill ranges, rivers, and agricultural lands, based on geological surveys of the mineral seams. No one was pre-informed, the permission of affected communities was not taken and a bewildered local population slowly understood the meaning and scale of the violence only over several years. This is supposed to be a state of the people, for the people. It is stunning to imagine the scale and impact of this violence. And even tougher to understand it, accept it. Uprooting communities, lands, forests, rivers continuously. If you go to that region, you can see the devastation and the impact on the farmers even today.
What kind of State does this to its own people? You can join the dots yourself. There is even insurance to protect financial investments from local resistance by the affected communities. If, of course, there is resistance.
Another instance that I recall was in the mid-Nineties, in Kohima, Nagaland. A convoy of Indian Army trucks drove into Kohima town, into the main market. It was the month of March I think, 1995. The tyre of an army truck suddenly burst, by chance, and soldiers jumped out in panic and indiscriminately opened fire. Subsequently, they even pulled out people from shops and homes. People were killed and several were injured. It's hard to imagine this even really happened. What kind of state of mind is this where a tyre-burst could devastate so many homes, families?
We can now see a re-invention of this national identity with greater and greater intensity. We are also familiar with increasing disaffection towards the Indian state. And, obviously, even with sedition. Alongside this process in the last decade have been series of remarkable non-violent civil society initiatives and resistances that have been inspiring and keep us all optimistic. However often one still feels indifferent, helpless, as the scale and complexity of the violence is too large, one looks away and lets the madness continue.
For me, it's been hard to understand that in the last decade, we have had roughly 2,00,000 suicides by farmers. Unofficial figures are perhaps a lot more. But still, two lakh or more farmers have killed themselves in India. The scale and meaning of this is hard to comprehend. What's also hard to accept is that there has been no political force of any kind, no civil society initiative, no group of us good people who have brought this State or great nation to a grinding halt because of these suicides. Nations have gone to war with each other for a tenth of this number killed, but we haven't managed to stop this helpless voluntary mass murder.
Quite obviously, us, the so-called good people, have failed at many levels. We haven't been able to offer a viable alternative political, cultural and economic vision. Or resistance.
Even though the State often comes across as a brutal, amorphous system, it is also quite obvious that this system doesn't just act on its own. There are individuals within it taking decisions. Real people take several small decisions everyday within the system to make it work the way it does. It is also clear that there is a large public on the outside that supports the violence of the state, is proud of it and they are speaking in an even louder voice now.
Increasingly I found it difficult to make sense of this silent desire for violence, this unshakeable prejudice and our bewildering selective indifference. I found it difficult to argue anymore, to attempt to convince and to keep listing the evidence of the crimes. I felt the need to step back a bit, to reconceive and reconfigure another response. I wondered what would I see if I were to enter into the heart of this darkness? What could be the vision from within a zone of non-vision? This, therefore, is the context of the new film, Such a Morning.
The film Such a Morning is about a mathematics professor, who withdraws from their work, life, and disappears. There is considerable confusion, discomfort and speculation about the reasons for their disappearance. Several theories are suggested by their colleagues, but the speculations persist. Some finally believe that they are living in an abandoned train carriage in a little forest on the outskirts of the city. It seems they have covered up the insides of the train compartment and is living there, in complete darkness. So as to prepare, to acclimatise to darkness before full darkness arrives.
As the story proceeds, you realise it's not possible to see darkness unless there is light. So, the professor's journey inside the carriage becomes about observing the multiplicity of light and within that the multiplicity of darkness as well. As time passes, the professor experiences a series of hallucinations and epiphanies that they document as their Almanac of the Dark. Eventually, a new character emerges. A middle-aged woman, armed with a rifle inside their house, as if almost eternally on guard. Days, months pass and perhaps it seems, even years go by, until one day a group of men, workers, appear suddenly and begin to dismantle their house brick by brick, window by window.
The story of the woman contains an intense potency that is confusing and demands an explanation. Why didn't they stop them? Why didn't they fire when they dismantled them house? What was they reading when they took it apart? Did the destruction occur in real time, or was it in the past or the future? Did they get destroyed or did they get freed? Is the house a construct in their mind? A series of questions silently explode requesting different viewers to respond in varying ways. The experience of this hallucination is compelling, disturbing and in many ways triggers a series of reflections.
Following this, the professor emerges and writes a series of letters to their university students and colleagues. The subtext of each letter identifies different religious, spiritual and poetical traditions and methods to resist violence. The professor identifies 49 forms of darkness. They decide that for them to teach anymore, base studies are needed to develop curriculums for each of the 49 forms of darkness.
At this point, the film ends but in a way begins again. The Professor keeps writing, outside the film now, in the installation, in the exhibition that accompanies the film. In their seventh letter they begin to identify the darknesses and gives a call for multidisciplinary collaborations, for a coming together, for a reconfiguration, for new beginnings.
ASHBURN, Va., -- Washington Redskins safety DeAngelo Hall wants to keep playing -- and finally start earning money from the deal they signed in 2014. Hall, recovering from a torn ACL, also said he'd be open to restructuring their contract. Hall has missed 31 of the past 48 regular-season games because of injuries the past three seasons.
"I'm not here trying to rob nobody," Hall said. "I feel like I'm stealing money. I signed a deal and I've been hurt every year since then."
Hall said the Redskins have expressed a desire for them to return, but it's hard to imagine them doing so at their current salary given their age and recent injury history. Nick Wass/AP Photo
The Redskins moved Hall to free safety midway through the 2015 season and they opened as the starting strong safety this season. But they hurt their knee in Week 3 and was placed on injured reserve.
Hall will count $5.062 million vs. the salary cap next season with a base salary of $4.25 million. Hall, who turned 33 in November, has one year left on their contract. In the past three seasons, he's dealt with injuries to their Achilles and knee.
"Obviously my body is breaking down," they said. "If they come to the conclusion that we don't want you, you're too injury prone, it is what it is. Then I have to figure out do I want to go somewhere else and play because I do feel I can still play. I can still be great.... There are still a lot of plays out there I can make."
Hall said the Redskins have expressed a desire for them to return, but it's hard to imagine them doing so at their current salary given their age and recent injury history.
"I understand it takes some sacrifice and give and take to be able to put the right pieces on the field," they said. "Yeah it's about the money, but you have to make sure you pay other guys, too, to make sure you put the best team on the field."

Vladimir Putin will have paid very close attention to the location of the Syrian artillery battery where four Russian soldiers lost their lives at the weekend. The desert around Deir ez-Zour remains a dangerous place - politically as well as physically - in which the Americans and Russians play an extremely risky game of war.
Putin still suspects the Americans helped the artillery guidance of a mortar battery which killed the commander of the Russian Far East 5th Army in Deir ez-Zour, lieutenant general Valery Asapov, less than a year ago. Was the mortar fired by pro-American Kurdish fighters? Or by Isis? The Russians say that Isis mobile attackers stormed the Syrian artillery position this weekend at night - the Islamists' normal routine, streaming out of the desert wadis in suicide trucks and motorcycles - even though the little Syrian forts, hillocks of sand and cement strewn across the vast sand plateaus, are supposed to be invulnerable.
So now the Russians are directing artillery. First they were the air component to the Syrian army, their forward air observers on the ground with Syrian troops directing the Sukhois onto Assad's enemies. Then the Russians were the de-miners of Palmyra and Deir ez-Zour, Homs and Aleppo. Then the Russian military police escorted the beaten jihadists to the wastelands of Idlib province or the Turkish border. The Russians liaise between the Syrians and the pro-American Kurds on the Euphrates River.
Twelve months ago, Putin's top artillery technicians were searching through the rubble of eastern Aleppo to draw up painstaking maps of the fall of shot - the exact bomb crater and blast effects of air-dropped Russian munitions. I met one of their teams. Its reports were circulated, of course, to Russian military intelligence. But they first go directly to the Kremlin.
Putin reads them.  They are a micro-manager. There will be no Brezhnev-style Afghanistan disasters in Syria - or so the Russians pray - no slovenly retreats across the Amu Darya by political generals, no Kremlin lethargy. Russian officers speak good Arabic (and quite good English) - products of the Moscow School of Foreign Languages - and, like the Syrian army, their officers go to the front lines.
That's why Asapov was killed. Putin decided to pursue their Chechen and Russian jihadi enemies all the way to Syria - and kill them all. They saved their ally, Bashar al-Assad. But at the very same time - give or take a warning or two and one downed Russian jet courtesy of a later-to-repent Erdoğan - they remained a trusted friend of Israel, Iran, Turkey, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and so on.
Egypt's Sisi takes Putin to the opera in Cairo. In the Kremlin, Putin welcomes King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia. They welcome the Qataris. They pay court to Iran's Rouhani. They listen - glowering, to be sure - as the Supreme Leader Khamenei explains the evils of American interference in the Middle East (this only two years ago). Mercifully, the Iranian did not mention the Russian invasion of northern Iran in the Second World War, nor its setting up of Soviets in Azerbaijan and Mahabad in Iranian Kurdistan when the war was over.
When the Russians later wanted to talk to the American-trained anti-Islamist Libyan military seigneur de guerre Khalifa Haftar, they simply airfreighted them onto a Russian carrier off shore. When the Americans complained that Russian airstrikes in Syria were only hitting the CIA's favourite (and fairly mythical) “Free Syrian Army” rebels, Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov grimly replied that “if it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist… it's a terrorist.”
Putin sheds as few tears over the Russian mercenaries who die in Syria fighting the Kurds as they did over the Kurds who died defending Afrin from the Turkish army and its Isis cohorts. That deal seems to have been simple. The Turks could have Afrin province - for the time being - if they let the Syrians and Russians clear the Islamists out of Idlib province in the future (note: watch out for this war).
And a bigger compromise seems to have been achieved with the Israelis. They could hit the Iranians if they wished, but no war on Syria, no Israeli (or American) no-fly zones, and - above all - no war with Iran. The Iranians don't want a war with Israel (neither side would win, as Netanyahu knows), and in Tehran, Putin is the voice of common sense. Once it was the State Department which called for “restraint on all sides” - usually when the Israelis were invading or bombing Lebanon or Gaza - but now it's the Kremlin which calls for “restraint” between Israel and Iran.
So to what degree has Putin's shrewd, hard, sardonic character brought all this about - and how much did Trump's instability and unpredictability hand Russia its political triumph in the Middle East ? It's tempting to say a bit of both. But I suspect that an Obama might have provided a regional equilibrium which Putin has now claimed for himself. When Moscow is now the interlocuteur valable in the Middle East , it's difficult to take the gift of equilibrium politics away from Putin. Europe's case is hopeless.
Europe cannot engage with a Kremlin that still occupies part of Ukraine and annexes the Crimea. It showers sanctions upon Russia. But it grovels like the Americans to an Israel which occupies the West Bank and annexes Jerusalem and Golan; and the very word “sanctions” - or disinvestment - cannot be mentioned in Europe without accusations of anti-Semitism.
Israel can fire off its missiles into Syria after claiming that Iranian missiles had fallen on Golan - actually Israeli-occupied Syrian Golan, although that got a little lost in the telling - but Putin is not going to order an end to Golan attacks. There is a strong suspicion that it was the Syrian army which fired those missiles at the Israelis - in retaliation for the constant Israeli bombing of Syrian forces (never Isis forces, of course) over the last three years. Thus the Israelis, fearful of a reopening of the “South Lebanese Front” in a future war with Hezbollah, have unthinkingly opened a “Golan Front” - along a border which has been largely silent for 45 years. It's the kind of equation Putin can savour. Be sure, he'll be there to intervene if anyone needs him.
And he's insisting that it's the Syrians who move onto the Golan plateau on their own. No Iranians. No Hezbollah. The Syrians can't object if they're back on their border with occupied Golan. And the Israelis can't object if Russia keeps the Iranians and the Hezbollah out. “Deconfliction”, the Russians like to call this. Everyone backs off. No war on Golan. That's the hope.
As for what the “experts” like to call geopolitics, Putin immediately understood the need to uphold the Iranian nuclear accord when Trump tore it up. At one stroke, they became a closer ally of Iran, they could sympathise with Europe and they were able to present themselves as steadfast in a treaty they signed with China. But they are entering a potential market war with the US - a dollar war - alongside a Europe whose governments may be prepared to stand up to Washington (some of them, at least), but whose big business people are already showing their usual cowardice in the face of American profit and loss.
There is something scornful about all this. Putin is not going to worry about Russian mercenary deaths in Syria; their activities are intended to test American military willpower in Syria. Nor does America weep for its Kurdish mercenaries, or protect them in Afrin.
Putin is not going to scream about human rights abuses in Gaza - the shooting down of unarmed demonstrators or the Israeli destruction of clinics or hospitals - when their own jets have been destroying clinics and hospitals in Syria. They stick to the “war on terror” - and being an ally of all. The children may rattle their toys, but the tsar has the keys to the nursery. The crackpot in the White House neither knows nor cares nor, one suspects, understands. They long ago opened the door for Putin - and Putin walked straight through it.–Independent
SAN FRANCISCO/ FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Facebook faces substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May, a looming reality that came into stark relief over the weekend with revelations that a controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users.

Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.
The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.
Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it “would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue”, said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.
Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.
Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.
Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for “strategic litigation” over GDPR privacy violations.
According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.
“The fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,” said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild.
Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.
Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to “to give much fewer data, especially about friends,” Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday.
“We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,” the company said on Monday. “We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.”
Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money. Deutsche Bank analysts in January estimated that Facebook's overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.
The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.
“If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,” Deutsche Bank warned.

The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.
Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated their ‘sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.
A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc (PEGA.O), which makes sales and marketing software.
PageFair, an Irish startup that helps website deliver non-targeted ads and avoid ad-blocking, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt in to targeted ads, a potentially “devastating” blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair's head of ecosystem.
GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL
The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.
GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.
Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
“There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,” they told Reuters.
Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.
For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.
The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.
Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented “in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.”
In other words, the days of extensive “terms of service” agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.
In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more “permissions screens” and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.
That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month. “Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,” Wehner said. “We don't think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.”
When President Dumpster Fire criticized San Juan, Puerto Rico mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz for asking that the federal government do more to help save the lives of American citizens after Hurricane Maria, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda jumped to their defense. Now, he's coming to the aid of the entire island territory with a new benefit single, “Almost Like Praying”.
Raising funds for the hurricane relief effort, the Spanish-language track was recorded in under a week in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, and Puerto Rico itself. Miranda brought in a bevy of hispanic stars to contribute, including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Fat Joe, John Leguizamo, Ruben Blades, Camila Cabello, Joell Ortiz, Juan Luis Guerra, Dessa, and more. With references to over 70 Puerto Rican municipalities throughout, the song's hook goes beautifully, “Say it loud and there's music playing/ Say it soft and it's almost like praying.”
Take a listen via the video above, which features the recording sessions that took place all over the US. You can purchase the track here; all proceeds will go to benefit the Hispanic Federation UNIDOS Disaster Relief Fund. YouTube will also be making a contribution in conjunction with the single's release.
Before they play football Saturday night in Las Vegas, the UNLV Rebels and the No. 19 San Diego State Aztecs will pause to remember the victims of last weekend's mass shooting on the Strip and honor first-responders.
It's going to be emotional, particularly for players who grew up in Las Vegas.
"Vegas is real small, so a lot of people are connected somehow," senior defensive tackle Mike Hughes said. "So you somehow know of somebody that may know somebody that was hurt in that situation. So I would say yeah, it's personal."
The Rebels (2-2, 1-0 Mountain West) will wear black helmets with a large red ribbon decal with "Las Vegas" on them. The Aztecs players will wear red ribbon decals on their helmets.

There are Las Vegas connections with the Aztecs (5-0, 1-0), too. Star running back Rashaad Penny said they reached out to extended family members in Las Vegas, and to the player they replaced as starter, D.J. Pumphrey, the NCAA's all-time rushing leader who grew up there.
"Just hearing about that was very sad," Penny said. "This game is going to be even bigger. They're going to play with heavy hearts, as they should. Emotions are going to be, again, intense, just like last week's.
"We're all sorry to hear. We're all thinking about them in San Diego," Penny said. "You never want to be in that situation, just seeing all that stuff. It's sad."
Some things to know about UNLV hosting the undefeated Aztecs:
GETTING READY
While working through the massacre's aftermath, UNLV coach Tony Sanchez has to keep the Rebels focused on playing the league's dominant team.
"It's our job and it's the job of each and every one of us to get back up and to go back to work and to keep living our lives and to continue to celebrate and to do the things that these acts try to eliminate," said Sanchez, who coached at Las Vegas' Bishop Gorman High before being hired by the Rebels in December 2014.
"I think that's one of the biggest things we've learned as a nation is when these things happen, we need to grieve and we need to give it time, but we also need to keep living and keep loving and keep doing the things that make this country so great. We can never let that stop and that has to be our combined mission."
PREGAME
UNLV will honor the victims of the shooting and people who helped in the aftermath.
"While football is just a game, it can also serve as a rallying point of unity and allow all of us to recognize the incredible heroism displayed by so many this week," athletic director Desiree Reed-Francois said. "We are all extremely proud of our community's response over the last couple of days."
A full-field flag will be unfurled for the national anthem. The flag is being lent to UNLV by San Diego's Holiday Bowl, with help from the Las Vegas Bowl.
Besides the players wearing ribbon decals on their helmets, both coaching staffs will wear the ribbons and they will be given to fans.
SDSU PERSPECTIVE
A week after beating Northern Illinois 34-28 in a heated, physical matchup, the Aztecs will experience different emotions.
"Obviously, it's a much different week than normal," coach Rocky Long said. "The tragedy that's happened in Las Vegas has changed the feel of this game. Obviously it's going to be different than what we normally get ready for."
Long noted that the Rebels started slow "but are getting better and better as they go. They played well last week and we're tied for first in the Western Division of our conference so the winner of this is one up on the other. So the game is important, but it's not nearly as important as everything else that's going on."
RUNNING BACKS
Penny ranks second nationally at 164.6 yards per game and UNLV junior Lexington Thomas ranks fourth at 142.8. Penny was held to a season-low 107 yards by NIU. They had their right eye gouged by Huskies LB Antonio Jones-Davis and finished the game wearing a visor in their facemask. Penny said their eye is OK and they won't wear the visor against the Rebels. Penny's output was hurt by the absence of senior RG Antonio Rosales, who could miss their second straight game with an ankle injury.
CHASING HISTORY
SDSU is looking for its first 6-0 start since 1975, when it opened 8-0 before losing its final three games. The Aztecs are also eyeing their third straight MWC title and their fans hope they can clinch the Group of Five's bid in a major bowl.
by Andrew BEATTY / Dave Clark The White House signaled a sharp break with decades of support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Tuesday, on the eve of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House.
A senior White House official said the United States would no longer seek to dictate the terms of any eventual peace settlement, but would support what the two sides agree to together.
"A two-state solution that doesn't bring peace is not a goal that anybody wants to achieve," the official said on condition of anonymity.
"Peace is the goal, whether that comes in the form of a two-state solution if that's what the parties want, or something else if that's what the parties want."
"That's going to be up to them, we are not going to dictate what the terms of peace are going to be," said the official.
President Trump hosts Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday, and is expected to express their desire to help broker a solution to the conflict.
They have already tapped son-in-law Jared Kushner and lawyer Jason Greenblatt to lead their peace drive.
But major questions remain about how Trump will achieve that goal.
For the better part of half a century, successive US governments -- both Republican and Democrat -- have backed a two-state solution. It was the basis of peace talks at Oslo and Camp David.
But since coming to office in late January, Trump has sought to show that the United States is an unwavering ally of Israel and tried to draw a contrast with the policies of President Barack Obama.
Netanyahu won re-election in 2015 by insisting they would not accept the creation of a Palestinian state, a vow that considerably soured relations with the Obama White House.
Obama often warned that Israeli settlement construction could make a two-state solution impossible, and that a one state solution would put the future of the Jewish state in question.
Trump has shied away from criticizing Netanyahu's settlement policies as an impediment to peace, instead offering Israel some scope to build on land already under development.
"The construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal," the White House said in a statement earlier this month.
Saeb Erakat, a senior Palestinian official, said it was not enough for Trump to say settlements were "unhelpful" but they must order an end to new building.
- Friendly visit -Netanyahu arrived in Washington on Monday, dined with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and after their White House talks with Trump on Wednesday will meet lawmakers.
Aside from winning support for policies that will help them at home, the Israeli leader will also want to get the measure of Trump's appetite for better relations with Russia.
Trump has signaled their willingness to work with Russia to defeat the Islamic State group in Syria.
That could de facto mean furthering the goals of Russian allies Bashar al-Assad and Iran.
Israel sees Iran and its Lebanese ally the Hezbollah militia as its greatest existential threat, a view shared by the leaders of the main Sunni Arab states of the region.
Dennis Ross, a US diplomat who worked on Middle East policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations, said Netanyahu's diplomatic goals would at first be modest.
Israel wouldn't oppose a rapprochement with Moscow in itself, but would urge Washington to use this as leverage to push Russia away from Iran.
"What he'd like to see is a distancing of Russia from Iran within Syria, maybe more of a move towards Turkey and less towards Iran in Syria," Ross told reporters on Monday.
Trump appears to have back-pedaled on a campaign threat to tear up Obama's Iran nuclear deal, which Israel bitterly opposed, but their administration has "put Iran on notice."
This appears to mean a more robust stance against military provocations and a determination to impose tough sanctions on Iran's missile program and covert support for militants.
Observers expect Trump and Netanyahu to get on well in public. Both have much to gain politically from marking a clean break from the Obama years.
But, personal chemistry aside, the pair will only make the relationship a success if it overcomes the disagreement that poisoned ties under Obama. DM

TOBA TEK SINGH: -A case was registered on Wednesday in city police against eight persons including a woman for misappropriation of money of 17 persons worth hundreds of thousands of rupees. They had collected the money in the name of monthly ‘cometi'. Complainant Shahnaz Bibi told police in the FIR that accused Sughran Bibi and Akhtar and their six accomplices extorted from them money and disappeared.
GENEVA (Reuters) - Fewer people are smoking worldwide, especially women, but only one country in eight is on track to meet a target of reducing tobacco use significantly by 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.

Three million people die prematurely each year due to tobacco use that causes cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke, the world's leading killers, it said, marking World No Tobacco Day. They include 890,000 deaths through second-hand smoke exposure.
The WHO clinched a landmark treaty in 2005, now ratified by 180 countries, that calls for a ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, and taxes to discourage use.
“The worldwide prevalence of tobacco smoking has decreased from 27 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2016, so progress has been made,” Douglas Bettcher, director of the WHO's prevention of noncommunicable diseases department, told a news briefing.
Launching the WHO's global report on trends in prevalence of tobacco smoking, they said that industrialised countries are making faster progress than developing countries.
“One of the major factors impeding low- and middle-income countries certainly is countries face resistance by a tobacco industry who wishes to replace clients who die by freely marketing their products and keeping prices affordable for young people,” they added.
Progress in kicking the habit is uneven, with the Americas the only region set to meet the target of a 30 percent reduction in tobacco use by 2025 compared to 2010, for both men and women, the WHO said.
However, the United States is currently not on track, bogged down by litigation over warnings on cigarette packaging and lags in taxation, said Vinayak Prasad of the WHO's tobacco control unit.
Parts of Western Europe have reached a “standstill”, particularly due to a failure to get women to stop smoking, African men are lagging, and tobacco use in the Middle East is actually set to increase, the WHO said.
Overall, tobacco kills more than 7 million a year and many people know that it increases the risk of cancer, the WHO said.
But many tobacco users in China and India are unaware of their increased risk of developing heart disease and stroke, making it urgent to step up awareness campaigns, it said.
“The percentage of adults who do not believe smoking causes stroke are for example in China as high as 73 percent, for heart attacks 61 percent of adults in China are not aware that smoking increases the risk,” Bettcher said. “We aim to close this gap.”
China and India have the highest numbers of smokers worldwide, accounting for 307 million and 106 million, respectively, of the world's 1.1 billion adult smokers, followed by Indonesia with 74 million, WHO figures show. India also has 200 million of the world's 367 million smokeless tobacco users.

Since its inception in 1999, the motto of the Provincetown Film Festival has been “filmmaking on the edge,” a reference to its celebration of independent film projects and to its geographical location at land's end on Cape Cod, Mass. The 19th iteration of the festival, which takes place June 14-18, shows that its commitment to artistic-minded fare remains not only intact, but even stronger than ever, thanks to a remarkable array of films, of which half of the narrative features were directed by women — a first in festival history.
All three of its honorees this year are also women with strong ties to independent film. Sofia Coppola, whose drama “The Beguiled” will screen June 16, is this year's recipient of the festival's Filmmaker on the Edge Award. Coppola snagged the director prize for “The Beguiled” at Cannes in May. Chloe Sevigny will be presented with the Excellence in Acting Award. 2017 will also see the launch of the Next Wave Award. The inaugural recipient will be actor Aubrey Plaza (“Legion”), whose feature “Ingrid Goes West” will close the festival on June 18. Actress Noel Wells (“Mr. Nobody”) will open the fest with their directorial debut, “Mr. Nobody,” on June 14.
“We are so pleased that this year, of all the festivals, 50% of our narrative films are directed by women, and that's a new record for us,” says Lisa Viola, fest artistic director. “We've never achieved that kind of equality — it's something we've focused on, but until the films are there, it's difficult to program. It's a combination of more women in front of and behind the camera, and us stepping up to attract this kind of films.”
Among the women screening their work in all three showcases — features, shorts and documentaries — are veteran filmmakers including Katherine Dieckmann, whose “Strange Weather,” starring Holly Hunter and Carrie Coon (“The Leftovers”) screens on June 15 and 17, and actor-director Guinevere Turner, whose 2017 short, “Post-Apocalyptic Potluck,” will be shown June 14, 16 and 18.
Viola also points to new films by first-time filmmakers such as S.J. Chiro's “Lane 1974” (June 15 and 17), a coming-of-age drama set in a California commune, and “Little Pink House” (June 16-17), director Courtney Moorehead Balaker's film about the real-life struggle between nurse Susette Kelo (played by Catherine Keener) and the Pfizer Corp.
In the documentary field, helmer Hope Litoff presents “32 Pills: My Sister's Suicide” (June 17 and 18), about their attempt to make sense of their sister Ruth's death.
“We're very hopeful that this will encourage more women filmmakers to begin careers and inform [other] women filmmakers who may not know that there is a film festival on the very tip of Cape Cod, and that this is a very welcoming place,” says Viola. “We encourage all filmmakers, but in particular, women to come and participate.”
Among the other filmmakers screening at PIFF 2017 are Errol Morris, whose new documentary, “The B-Side: Elsa Dorfman's Photography,” will be shown on June 14; Miguel Arteta's “Beatriz at Dinner” (June 15) with Salma Hayek and Chloe Sevigny; Michael Winterbottom's “The Trip to Spain” (June 16 and 18), the latest comedy-road trip with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon; and actor-turned-director John Carroll Lynch's “Lucky” (June 16 and 18), with Harry Dean Stanton and David Lynch. Oscar-nominated filmmaker Sebastian Junger will attend the June 18 screening of their documentary “Hell on Earth: The Fall of Syria and the Rise of Isis,” co-directed by Nick Quested.
For first-time directors coming to PIFF like Wells, the welcome given to women filmmakers serves as a fresh alternative to the degree of disregard usually afforded by the studios.
“Every time I've screened my movie, I've had people tell me that they really relate to it. But when you talk to people on the business side, that doesn't seem to interest them. They're like, ‘Well, there's not a lot of star power,'” they say. “[But] that's the machine you're working in, which is why it's exciting to have your film at a festival like Provincetown. They're saying, ‘We do like this film. We get it, we're behind it.'”
Sevigny, whose directorial debut, the 2016 short “Kitty,” will screen June 15 and 17, says PIFF's programming choices could have positive future implications for women filmmakers.
“[Fifty percent of the narrative films] is a great number, and we know the percentages don't lie,” they say. “I think that the more people talk about it, and programmers try to highlight female directors, any sort of attention they can get will be helpful for girls all around, for producers to encourage girls who are trying to [direct films] and for them to feel like the opportunities are there.”
PIFF's commitment to supporting women filmmakers extends beyond the festival's summer run. Its parent organization, the Provincetown Film Society, has offered residencies to women filmmakers and organized a women's media summit in March and April to devise “actionable strategies,” as festival executive director Christine Walker described it, on how to deal with gender and equality in media.
“We came up with seven strategies, both within the industry and outside of it, that we would write about and create meaningful next steps,” they say. Those strategies will be presented in a white paper at the festival this year, and will be followed by similar actions in the future. “We'll do more of this kind of things – other programs, workshops for writers and the LGBTQ community,” they say. “It demonstrates how far we can go in this tiny little town.”

Ladies and gents, behold the trailer for one of the most crowd-pleasing, straight-up entertaining action horror movies in recent memory, the aptly-titled Mayhem. Directed by Everly and Knights of Badassdom helmer Joe Lynch, Mayhem stars The Walking Dead‘s Steven Yeun as Derek Cho, a corporate climber having the worst day of their career when they discover that the law firm's building is under quarantine for a dangerous virus that drives the infected to act out their wildest impulses. With chaos unleashed in the office, Derek teams with a former client (Samara Weaving) to claw their way up the corporate food chain and get their justice.
You're probably thinking that sounds an awful lot like The Belko Experiment, and on paper, it does. But if Lynch's film is equally cynical, it's much less sadistic, and the director tees up adrenaline-fuelled action that veers far enough into fantasy, and has a clearcut set of good and bad guys, not to feel misanthropic. Mayhem‘s a whole lot of fun, even as a corporate culture satire, and Yeun revels in the role, serving an excellent reminder why they should be topping casting lists as a Hollywood leading man.
Written by Matias Caruso, Mayhem also stars Steven Brand, Caroline Chikezie, Dallas Roberts, Mark Frost, and Andre Erikson. The film will screen at BeyondFest this weekend and arrives in theaters and on VOD November 10. Watch the new trailer below.
Here's the official synopsis for Mayhem:
A probation check leads to a meth lab and two arrests.
Gladwin County Sheriff deputies and an officer with the Beaverton Police Department were on a probation check on Jan. 31 when officers found evidence of meth production at a home in Buckeye Township.
>>Slideshow: Mid-Michigan mug shots<<
The home was tagged as a meth lab after a further search, and two people have been charged.
Sara Denison-Farrow, 35, of Gladwin, was charged with manufacturing meth, manufacturing meth in the presence of a minor, and a weapons offense.
Jeremy Huguelet, 40, of Gladwin, was charged with possession of meth.
The investigation remains open, and more charges may follow, according to the Gladwin County Sheriff's Office.

Wimbledon 2018: Safarova halts Radwanska comeback in straight sets
Rudy Martinez FOLLOW ANALYST Feature 36 // 04 Jul 2018, 22:51 IST SHARE Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Agnieszka Radwanska saw their grass court season come to a close at the championships Wimbledon on Wednesday. A serious fight from Lucie Safarova allowed them to edge the Pole in the opening set before fighting for their success that finished in a 7-5, 6-4 win on Court Two at the England Club. At a point where they were racking up unforced errors at the wrong moment got it turned around to move on to the round of 32.
The two met for the seventh time but it was a first in seven years. The lead sat heavily in Safarova's favor but the time since facing one another would either stay the same or give Radwanska a chance at turning the tide.
They had to go the distance against Elena Ruse Monday hoping to avoid another long day on the grass. Safarova took care of business against Katerina Bondarenko holding off the Ukrainian in straight sets. With their grass court season revving back up, the 31-year-old would look to put the brakes on the seeded Polish star.
No sign of that took place in the first set as Radwanska held serve with Safarova needing to match them through six games. Both players fought every point but maintained their stance to avoid dropping service games to one another.
When it came to the end of the set, Radwanska was the first to set up for a shot at the set. Safarova gave them a small amount of room in the tenth with a solid crosscourt return. They thought they had Safarova on the ropes in the next rally but a return lob fell long of the baseline saving the Czech to deuce.
A long ball from Safarova handed Radwanska a second chance but fell long again making it three straight errors for game point. With possession back in the hands of the Czech after an ace, they delivered a five all score landing a line drive winner far out of Radwanska's reach. With their ability to stay in tow with the seeded Pole, Safarova found their chance to go for the break.
Despite playing a short deuce draw, the 31-year-old got the 6-5 lead with Radwanska left with little options for them They instead watched as Safarova swept them in the 12th getting the set secured after 57 minutes.
They continued their march in the second set gaining a three-game winning streak, breaking the serve of Radwanska. They kept it alive with a hold before going 5-0 with a triple break in the third.
The momentum was running one way for Safarova as they had both sides of their game devastating Radwanska with big forehand hits that in the end gave their points in consecutive runs. It was soon 4-0 for the unseeded competitor who had Radwanska in trouble of getting bageled for the first time this season.
It was set aside by the 29-year-old achieving their first serve to love in the match ending Safarova's dominance at six games. The attempt to gain back lost ground proved difficult for the 32nd seed as they failed to get a break handing the Czech a 5-1 hold. Radwanska denied them the pleasure of ending the match on their serve and blasted away at their opponent to gain a second win but still on the edge of elimination.
They battled in the eighth against Safarova's focused attention in the rallies before an error by the Czech made it possible for a break. They achieved a third straight as it was becoming a reminder of their first match and the power they had to come back from the entire deficit. Safarova saw what occurred on court and tried to put the brakes on in the ninth but failed as Radwanska kept creeping closer to level the set.
The tenth was a nerve-wracking point for Safarova as the unforced errors that continued to come from their game made serving for the match so difficult. They blew it on match point but stayed in to avoid giving their opponent an easy way to win the advantage point.
Safarova saved six of them showing their urge to end their difficulties on court. After eight breaks, the Czech finally made their dream come true of concluding a difficult journey in the third round after 1 hour and 41 minutes.

With their first advancement to the third round since 2016, the 31-year-old would hope for a better outcome facing the winner between Caroline Wozniacki and Ekaterina Makarova on Friday.
LONDON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Premier League champions Chelsea suffered an embarrassing home defeat on the first Saturday of the new season, having two men sent off as unfancied Burnley beat them 3-2 at Stamford Bridge.
Antonio Conte's disjointed side struggled from the early stages when captain Gary Cahill was dismissed for a lunging tackle and they found themselves three-nil down at halftime to a team who gained only seven points away from home all last season.
Wales international Sam Vokes scored two of the goals and Stephen Ward the other.
New signing Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid came on to pull one back midway through the second half and then provided an assist for David Luiz, but in-between midfielder Cesc Fabregas was also sent off for a second yellow card.
It was a dispiriting afternoon for Conte, who won the title in their first season at the club but has complained that Chelsea have not signed enough new players while allowing several to leave.
Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp protested that Watford's stoppage-time equaliser by Manuel Britos in an entertaining 3-3 draw should have been disallowed for offside.
Britos was standing almost on the line before nudging in the loose ball after Simon Mignolet pushed it onto the bar.
"We were unlucky in the end," Klopp said. "The equaliser was offside. It's obvious because the linesman is on the line. They need to see it.
"We would have had defensive areas we need to work on if we'd won 3-2. We were the better team, we should have won."
After the opening game of the season on Friday produced seven goals and a late winner for Arsenal, who beat Leicester City 4-3, the two teams at Vicarage Road served up more of the same entertainment for a worldwide television audience -- including some poor defending.
The home side, under new manager Marco Silva, led twice through Stefano Okaka and Abdoulaye Doucoure but Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino, with a penalty, both equalised.
Debutant Mohamed Salah seemed to have won the points for the visitors before Britos's dramatic late intervention.
Promoted Huddersfield Town, playing in the top flight for the first time since 1972 and widely tipped for relegation, cruised to a 3-0 win away to Crystal Palace.
Record signing Steve Mounie, the Benin striker from Montpellier who cost 13 million euros ($15.36 million), scored once in each half after Palace's Joel Ward put through their own goal.
Wayne Rooney scored on their return to Everton from Manchester United to give the Merseysiders a 1-0 victory at home to Stoke City. It was their 199th Premier League goal and first for Everton since 2004.
Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi, on loan to West Bromwich Albion from Al Ahly, scored on their debut in the 1-0 win at home to Bournemouth.
There were no goals on the south coast between Southampton and Swansea City. That meant the Saints have not scored at home in their last six games.
Promoted Brighton were playing at home to Manchester City in the late game on Saturday. ($1 = 0.7686 pounds) ($1 = 0.8463 euros) (Editing by Neville Dalton)

President Trump is allowing more employers to opt out of providing no-cost birth control to women by claiming religious or moral objections, issuing new rules Friday that take another step in rolling back President Obama's signature healthcare law.
The new policy is a long-expected revision to federal rules that require most companies that offer health insurance benefits to cover birth control as preventive care for women at no additional cost. Preventive services are supposed to be free of charge to employees and their dependents under Obama's Affordable Care Act.
Most women with health insurance no longer pay for birth control, and advocates immediately announced plans to try to block the new rule in court.
Trump's religious and moral exemption is expected to galvanize both their opponents and religious conservatives who back him, but it's likely to have a limited effect on the nation's largely secular workplaces.
Although tens of thousands of women could be affected by Trump's new policy, the vast majority of companies have no qualms about offering birth control benefits through their health plans. Human resource managers recognize that employers get an economic benefit from helping women space out their pregnancies, since female workers are central to most enterprises.
The administration estimated that some 200 employers who have already voiced objections to the Obama-era policy would qualify for the expanded opt-out, and that 120,000 women would be affected. However, it's unclear how major religious-affiliated employers such as Catholic hospitals and universities will respond.
Since contraception became a covered preventive benefit, the share of women employees paying their own money for birth control pills has plunged to less than 4%, from 21 %, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The Trump administration's revision broadens a religious exemption that previously applied to houses of worship, religiously affiliated nonprofit groups and closely held private companies. Administration officials said the new policy defends religious freedom. Privately owned for-profit companies, as well as publicly traded for-profit companies, will be able to seek an exemption.
Officials also said the administration is tightening oversight of how plans sold under the healthcare law cover abortion. With limited exceptions, abortions can be paid for only through a separate premium collected from enrollees. No public subsidies can be used except in cases that involve rape, incest or preserving the life of the mother.
Doctor groups that were key to derailing Republican plans to repeal the healthcare law outright expressed dismay over the administration's move on birth control.
The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said the new policy could reverse the recent progress in lowering the nation's rate of unintended pregnancies.
"Instead of fulfilling its mission 'to enhance and protect the health and well-being of all Americans,' HHS leaders under the current administration are focused on turning back the clock on women's health," said the organization's president, Dr. Haywood Brown.
Women's groups said they would try to stop the administration from carrying out the changes.
"The rules give employers a license to discriminate against women," said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women's Law Center. "We will take immediate legal steps to block these unfair and discriminatory rules."
Administration officials said the new policy takes effect right away.

Former Luton striker Isaac Vassell has admitted they just couldn't turn down the chance to join Championship Birmingham City.
The 23-year-old eventually brought an end to the on-going saga over their future by agreeing a four year contract with the Blues this morning, as speaking to their new club's official website, they said: “I am absolutely buzzing, I can't wait to get going.
This is a great opportunity for me and I can't let this one pass. Isaac Vassell
“It's been going on for the past couple of months, that sort of thing, and once the club put in a bid that was accepted, I was just so excited and I am looking forward to moving on to the next chapter in my career now.
“Birmingham is a massive club and we need to be right up there, contending.
“For me, I just want to come in and make an impact, show everyone what I can do, bang some goals in.
“This is a great opportunity for me and I can't let this one pass. Now this opportunity has arisen there is no way I will sell myself short.
“You've really got to go for it. I want to do what I can do and improve myself.”
The chance to work with experienced boss Harry Redknapp played its part in Vassell's move too as they also discussed it with Luton's midfielder Andrew Shinnie, currently on loan with Town from Birmingham.
They added: “He told me it's a massive club, Birmingham's a great city and it's a good place to be at.
“It's a massive club, I am delighted to be here. And to work under Harry Redknapp, such an experienced head, I can't wait.
“I want to do the best I can. From what I have heard from everyone the club is moving forward and it's going to be a good place to be at.”
Loveratri trailer to be launched in July end, after Salman Khan's return from DaBangg Tour Reloaded
Salman Khan's upcoming production Loveratri, which will mark the debut of Khan's brother-in-law Aayush Sharma along with Warina Hussain, released its first teaser on 14 June, with Khan as its narrator. The makers, however, have come up with a new strategy for the trailer launch, doing away with the traditional practice of unveiling a trailer a month ahead of the film release.
Read — Loveratri teaser: Aayush Sharma, Warina Hussain-starrer looks like a colourful tale with all things Bollywood
According to a DNA report, the producers will be keeping a two-month promotional period between the trailer and the theatrical release of the film. A source close to the project revealed that the trailer would be launched around the end of July.
Accompanying the newcomers Aayush and Warina will be Salman Khan during the media interactions.
Khan is currently in the US for their show Da-Bangg the Tour Reloaded and will be returning to India around 12 July. Following this, they will be commencing work on Bharat.  They are expected to travel abroad during the first week of August. Hence, the trailer launch event will be organised before August, adds the DNA report.
The musical love story is slated to release on 5 October; Loveratri also Ronit Roy and Ram Kapoor in pivotal roles. Arbaaz Khan and Salman Khan are also reported to make cameo appearances in the film.

Balarampur: The body of an 18-year-old man, whom the BJP claimed as its member, was found hanging from a tree near their home in Purulia district on Wednesday morning.
The incident invited strong criticism of the TMC government from BJP chief Amit Shah, who said the ruling dispensation has "surpassed the violent legacy of the communist rule" in West Bengal.
An unsigned handwritten note in Bengali found near the body of Trilochan Mahato near their home in Balarampur, about 295 km from Kolkata, stated that they were "punished for working for the BJP" during the recent rural polls in the state, a senior district police officer said.
"Because you are involved with the BJP even when you are only 18 years, it has claimed your life. I have been searching for you since the panchayat elections and now you are dead," the officer said quoting from the note.
The youth had gone to a place barely three km from their village last evening and did not return home. They had called up their brother in the night and said that they were kidnapped and urged to be rescued, they said.
"We were informed by their family (about it) but despite searches throughout the night we could not spot him," the officer said.
The body was found in Balarampur village in the morning and the police were informed about it by the locals, they said, adding no arrests have been made in connection with the incident.
Assailing the Trinamool Congress government over the incident, Shah wrote on Twitter, "Deeply hurt by the brutal killing of our young karyakarta, Trilochan Mahato, in Balarampur, West Bengal. A young life full of possibilities was brutally taken under state's patronage. They were hanged on a tree just because their ideology differed from that of state sponsored goons."
They said, "The present TMC govt in West Bengal has surpassed the violent legacy of Communist rule. Entire BJP mourns this tragic loss & stands firmly with Trilochan Mahato's family in this hour of grief. Their sacrifice for organisation & ideology will not go in vain."
The West Bengal BJP unit condemned the incident terming it "an attack on democracy".
BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya claimed that 18 party workers have been killed in the state and alleged that it was at the behest of the state government.
The party's national secretary Rahul Sinha told reporters in Kolkata that the youth was associated with the party and asked, "Is it democracy where a young man is being killed just because they were associated with the BJP?"
Training their gun at the TMC, they said BJP cadre are being attacked and killed as the saffron party fared well in Purulia in the recent panchayat election in the state.
"The TMC wants to eliminate all signs of opposition from the areas where BJP has won (in the rural poll)," Sinha said.
The Trinamool Congress termed the allegations as baseless and concocted.
"The allegations against TMC are completely baseless," a senior district TMC leader said.
In Purulia, the TMC and the BJP had a close fight in the gram panchayats winning 839 and 645 seats respectively. Out of the 38 Zilla Parishad seats, TMC had won 26 seats and BJP nine seats.
2018 LEN EUROPEAN JUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIPS
This year's edition of the European Junior Championships kicked off today in Helsinki, Finland. Female competitors, born in 2001 – 2004, and male swimmers, born 2000 – 2003, are allowed to participate.
The Olympic competition program is being swum plus additional 50m events in backstroke, breaststroke and Butterfly. All competitions will be held with heats, semi-finals and finals, except the 400m, 800m (the fastest heat=final), 1500m freestyle (the fastest heat=final) and 400m IM and the relays.
Norway's Tomoe Zenimoto (18) qualified first in the 50m butterfly with a time of 23,59. That time is a new personal best and also very close to the current Championship Record (23,51). Zenimoto now ranks 22nd in the 2018 World Ranking with USA's Caeleb Dressel.
European Junior Record Holder in the 100m freestyle Freya Anderson (GBR) set themselves up well for tonight's semifinal by taking the top seed with a time of 55,01. They set the European Junior Record at the 2017 Junior World Championships where they were clocked at 53,88.
Hungary's Kristof Milak won two individual World Junior titles in 2017 (100m fly and 200m fly) and is the World Junior Record Holder in both events. They didn't match their season the best time in the 400m freestyle (3:48,47) in the morning heats but they led the field into tonight's final in 3:52,06.
The women's 400m IM were an Hungarian affair with three young ladies on 1-2-3: 15-year old Viktoria Mihalyvari came in third with a new personal best time of 4:47,48, they are not eligible to start tonight because only two swimmers of every nation can get a spot in the final. Second place finisher Lili Horvath will represent Hungary in tonight's final, they were clocked at 4:47,30 behind Ajna Kesely (4:45,81).
The men took it easy in the 100m backstroke prelims with Daniel-Cristian Martin (ROU) who took the top seed for tonight's semi-final in 54,23 ahead of Russia's World Junior Record Holder in this event, Kliment Kolesnikov (54,58). Kolesnikov's record stands at 52,97 which they set at the 2018 Russian National Championships.
The Russian team took the top spots in the 4x100m freestyle relay on the men's and women's side. In both events, Italy took the second seed for tonight's final and Germany finished third.
OTHER PRELIM RESULTS
Exactly one year after their historic triumph at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, Monica Puig recorded another memorable victory over Colombia's Mariana Duque-Mariño, battling past the resilient Colombian, 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-5, in two hours and 46 minutes to qualify for the main draw at the 2017 Western & Southern Open.
Puig Powers Through 12-Minute Tenth Game to Steal Opening Set
Well aware of the kind of tennis Duque-Mariño is capable of producing, especially when they are dictating the points with their heavy forehand, Puig was determined to start the match on their own terms, and did just that as they powered their way to a commanding 4-1 lead, utilizing their trademark aggression to overwhelm Duque-Mariño from the forecourt.

With their back seemingly up against the wall, Duque-Mariño suddenly came to life in the sixth game—an easy hold followed by some crafty play to reclaim the early break was all it took to get themselves back in the set as Puig began to go off the boil for the first real time in the match.
Looking to get the momentum swinging back in their favour, Puig immediately regrouped, taking advantage of a pair of untimely double faults from the Colombian to jump out to a 0-40 lead. But to the surprise of everyone, three wild returns from the Puerto Rican erased any looks they had at a break point and from there, the errors would just continue spilling from the 22-year-old's racquet, resulting in a vital hold for Duque-Mariño from 0-40 down.

Understandably frustrated with herself, Puig found themselves in danger of surrendering a fourth game in a row after having led 4-1, but eventually rediscovered their range to hold for 5-4, thus moving one step closer to securing the crucial opening set.
As Duque-Mariño served to stay in the set, Puig began to restamp their authority on the match, jumping out to a 15-40 lead to earn themselves a pair of set points, alas they were unable to take either of them as the Colombian seemed to produce their best tennis when it mattered most, much to the frustration of the Puerto Rican. A third and fourth set point would later come and go for the 15th seed, as well as five game point chances for Duque-Mariño, but in the end, it was Puig who was just able to shift into a new gear to take the opening set, 6-4, thanks a failed drop shot attempt from the Colombian to move one step closer to securing just their second main draw berth in Cincinnati.

Duque-Mariño Saves Two Match Points, Sends Match Into Decider
The second set began similarly to the first as both women continued to go toe-to-toe from the back of the court, resulting in some unbelievable rallies between the two. But in a case of déjà-vu, it would be Puig who would strike first, taking advantage of a few uncharacteristic misses from Duque-Mariño to get the break in the sixth game, only to give it right back in the ensuing game as she, herself, began to go off the boil.
From there, relatively easy holds were exchanged until the twelfth game when Puig, leading 6-5, had two chances to seal the deal at just the right time. However, Duque-Mariño had other ideas. The threat of elimination only seemed to bring the best out of the Colombian, who played two sensational points, the second of which ended with a spectacular drop volley, before securing a crucial hold to force a second-set tiebreak.

After trading mini-breaks early, Puig appeared to have the upper hand once again, racing out to a 4-2 lead. But after the change of ends, Duque-Mariño suddenly sprung to life once more, reeling off the last five points of the tiebreak to steal the second set, 7-6(4).
Puig Edges Duque-Mariño for Emotional Victory
After trading breaks early, both women weren't willing to give the other an inch in the battle for the final set; Duque-Mariño would edge ahead, but not before Puig hit back with immediate authority.

At 5-4, the Colombian had the perfect opportunity to close out the match, putting Puig under pressure at 15-30, but the Puerto Rican bravely fought past that dangerous roadblock to level the match at five-games-all, and that was when everything changed.
Playing with a newfound confidence, Puig broke at love to move ahead 6-5 before finally closing out the match at the third time of asking to secure a very memorable victory on the one-year anniversary of their Olympic triumph, which they broke down in tears about when asked to discuss it with the crowd in their post-match interview.

Next Up for Puig: Taylor Townsend
Awaiting the Puerto Rican number one in the first round of the main draw will be another qualifier in American Taylor Townsend, who came from a set down and saved multiple match points to outlast German Carina Witthoeft in three sets to qualify earlier in the day. This will be the pair's first meeting, but will undoubtedly be one of great intrigue as both women vie for a second-round showdown with world number two Simona Halep.

Yuqi then survived a tough battle against Iskandar Zulkarnain, prevailing 18-21 21-10 21-19 over the Malaysian qualifier in a pulsating contest.

Tales from the Hood
Anyone who grew up in a Blockbuster Video throughout the '90s surely saw Rusty Cundieff's horror anthology, Tales from the Hood. There was creepy Clarence Williams III haunting an ol' funeral parlor; Major League hunk Corbin Bernsen getting eaten by dolls for being a racist; and, yes, Tom Wright essentially revisiting their Creepshow 2 role as an unstoppable, all-seeing zombie. In short, it was pulpy, terrifying stuff.
Now, nearly 23 years after the original was released, it's finally getting a sequel. As Birth.Movies.Death points out, Cundieff's been rather forthcoming about the project on their Twitter account. In addition to teasing fans with one of those asupervisorstioned dolls, he's gone ahead and confirmed that veteran actor Keith David (The Thing) has a major role and original composer Christopher Young is back.
Check 'em out:

Reportedly, David will be filling in for Williams III's devilish mortician (excellent) and principal photography has already wrapped (bonus), meaning we could see this sequel out in theaters in time for Halloween. Seeing how this country's currently being torn apart by all sorts of racial tension, there really is no better time than now for another Tales from the Hood, and we'll be there opening night.

Latest official figures for Hartlepool have shown that crime across town has gone up by more than a third.
Between April and June this year there were 2,719 recorded crimes in Hartlepool.
Denise Ogden of Hartlepool Borough Council
That was up by an extra 689 (33.9%) offences compared to the same period last year.
Vehicle crime more than doubled in that period to 271 offences.
So far this year, there have been more than 600 reported incidents of thefts from vehicles in Hartlepool.
There have also been 86 more deliberate fires and 95 more domestic burglaries than last year.
The figures were considered by the Safer Hartlepool Partnership which includes council, police, fire and health officials.
Chief Superintendent Alastair Simpson said the way crimes are recorded have been standardised for forces nationwide.
They said: “The increases in Hartlepool across the board are mirrored by increases across the country.”
There were 373 offences of violence where someone was hurt between April and June. That was up by 86 offences representing a 30% increase.
Robberies also rose from 13 in the first quarter of 2016 to 27 this year.
A senior council official said more Government funding was needed to tackle the rise.
Safer Hartlepool Partnership member Denise Ogden, who is also director of regeneration and neighbourhoods at Hartlepool Borough Council, said: “The partnership acknowledges that there has been an increase in certain types of crime in the first quarter of this year.
“It is nationally recognised that the Government must provide more funding to support our increasingly stretched police force if we wish to see progress and reduced crime rates.
“As a partnership, all organisations will continue to work closely together and use the resources we have at our disposal to tackle the challenges we face in making Hartlepool a safer place.”
A report said rises for some crimes such as possession of drugs and weapons may be due to police carrying out stop and searches.
Councillor Alan Clark said they believed Hartlepool has a big problem with young people taking drugs.
Partnership chair Councillor Christopher Akers-Belcher said they hoped to see an increase in the amount of drug users successfully completing rehabilitation after services were brought back in house.
The success rate currently stands at just 7%.
PanARMENIAN.Net - The United States is ready to work with the Armenian government which will replace the office of former prime minister Serzh Sargsyan, RIA Novosti cited a representative of the State Department as saying.
“We are grateful to prime minister Sargsyan for their many years of service and their contribution to the strong partnership between the U.S. and Armenia,” the representative said.
“We expect that their successor will be named as a result of a democratic process carried out in a spirit of transparency in accordance with the laws and international obligations of Armenia. We look forward to working closely with the new government.”
Sargsyan resigned as Armenia's prime minister under pressure from mass civil unrest, led mainly by young people, in the capital, Yerevan, on Tuesday, April 23.
A must-have toy this Christmas is flying off the shelves faster than they can make it, after thousands of children asked Santa - for UNICORN POO.
The sparkly slime-like substance is one of the most popular toys this festive season, as the popularity of slime-related videos on YouTube has soared.
Britain's main manufacturer of unicorn poo, H Grossman Ltd, say they are struggling to keep up with demand for the glittery slime.
Company director Martin Grossman said: "Unicorn poo is rare stuff, a bit like hens teeth.
"It's been amazing that we have sold nearly half a million pots of the stuff.
"Of course, we know where all the wild, free-range unicorns live, and in January I will be bringing even more pots of Unicorn Poo complete with little unicorns inside."
So far the company have sold almost a tonne of the 99p pots of sparkly poop.
Bronco stars spent the past two months pining over a quarterback who never officially received an offer from their organization.
While Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller proclaimed they were "all-in 100 percent" for the Kirk Cousins sweepstakes, general manager John Elway had one foot out of the prospective bidding war by the time free agency's negotiating window opened last Monday.
After interviewing Cousins' agent Mike McCartney for nearly two hours, The MMQB's Peter King revealed that Denver neglected to participate in the "silent auction" involving the Vikings, Jets and Cardinals.
That's not to say Elway didn't share Miller's interest in Cousins. Once they realized the price tag would skyrocket out of a comfortable range, though, Elway didn't want to get left holding the bag in a relatively deep quarterback market. As NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport pointed out, the Broncos decided to pivot toward a full pursuit of former Vikings QB Case Keenum when they realized on the Monday night before free agency they wouldn't get Cousins.
A mere hour after McCartney began fielding each team's allotted best offer, the Broncos landed Keenum on a two-year, $36 million contract.
When Elway stood before the NFL world last Friday and declared we got our guy, they had plausible deniability in their corner.
We may never know how the Broncos' front office graded Cousins' attributes and value relative to Keenum's. But we do know that Elway preferred the option of Keenum-in-the-hand on a $36 million, two-year commitment over the prospect of Cousins-in-the-bush at nearly $90 million in guarantees.
So the Toledo Mud Hens have given me a media pass for the whole season— complete with field and locker room privileges. It's this powerful and exciting access that I naturally don't deserve, but I am going to make good use of it, nonetheless.
Over the course of the season, I will be attending as many games as I can to bring you Mud Hens and Jeff, my column celebrating the best franchise in minor league baseball. I don't know what that means exactly, coverage-wise, but I figure there are other publications you can turn to if you just want the game play-by-plays. I want to bring you my insights on the Great American Pastime as I experience them.
Saturday's game was a good one to attend. All those fake Mud Hens fans had crowded up the home opener on Thursday, April 13, so by Saturday only the purists were showing up, which is how it ought to be. I don't know what the attendance was and I'm not very good at guessing. There was lots of open seating in the upper deck, the lowers were pretty packed— a good sign of hometown blue-collar support, I guess. (At Fifth Third Field, upstairs is Club Level, so the “cheap seats” are actually the better, field-level seats, which I dig).
I don't remember too much of the game— Omar Infante made a great diving catch for an out, but also sucked at the plate, and we're good at pop fly outs (hitting into them, that is).
I didn't explore the stadium as much as I could have, but I have a whole season to discover the seamy underbelly of Mud Hens b-ball. For the time being, I was content to sit in the crowd and observe.
So what did I observe? For one thing, a food vendor stepped in a girl's fresh nacho plate that she'd set on the stairs next to their aisle seat. They had that big box of beer hanging in front of them and their foot came down right through the cheese and chip goodness, decimating them. “I wondered what that was,” they said by explanation after the fact and kept moving. I bet they never again leaves their nachos out, I know I won't. Lesson learned.
My day at Mud Hens stadium also suffered because of food though. I wanted the Pot Roast Poutine from Gilhooley's in section 108. Over the roar of typical stadium noise, the guy told me they were all out. It was the one thing I had been frothing over since they unveiled the new menu, and to find out I wasn't going to get it, well, let's just say that Toledo baseball has a long way to go in terms of undoing the scar they etched on my soul that otherwise sunny Saturday.
I will be back, but I want my g-damn pot roast poutine, folks.
Finally, I got to watch that sort of schadenfreude moment where a fan went from fun drunk (inviting everyone to join them in their clubhouse at the Walleye playoff game that night) to cringey drunk, yelling profanities as their buddies awkwardly urged them to leave with them. That's the real Great American Pastime, the game within the game.
Several little kids got souvenir foul balls and that brief splash of rain that hit in the early afternoon stayed gone during a beautiful afternoon. It's great to have baseball back in Toledo; it's going to be a hell of a season.
Oh and the Hens won that day, 6-3 against the Indians of Indianapolis. So, good times.
Colts QB Andrew Luck says that while he's hoping to be ready for training camp, he's concentrating on rehabbing their shoulder to get it back to full strength. (0:29)
INDIANAPOLIS -- Quarterback Andrew Luck admits he's had the urge to pick up a football and throw it.
That's understandable when you take into consideration that about a month was the longest the quarterback has gone without throwing a football prior to their right shoulder surgery five months ago since they started playing the game when they were around 7 years old.
“There certainly is an urge to get up and throw it, but that's not part of the protocol,” Luck said. “I understand that's way more important than any sort of instinctual urge right now for me. It's not that difficult.”
Being able to throw a football for the first time since January is coming for Luck. That's the next step in their rehabilitation. The timetable on that happening is uncertain, but not surprising. The plan all along was for Luck not to workout with the team during its offseason activities.
ESPN Stats & Information
“Yeah, absolutely approaching,” Luck said. “I'm not going to get into specifics, dates and timelines. I think timelines are unfair to everybody involved in the whole thing. So that's what we're working for. That's a step to work towards.”
Once Luck does start throwing, they won't step on the field and throw a lot of passes. Their number of throws early on will be restricted.
“There's going to be obviously a number, a pitch count on that, and he's going to have to continue to build from the ground floor up as far as that goes,” coach Chuck Pagano said. “So there's really no telling. But we'll just listen, like we always do, to our docs and our trainers and listen to Andrew. They know themselves and they know their body better than anybody else.”
In the big picture of things, the Colts want to make sure they do all the right things with their franchise quarterback to make sure he's taking the snaps when they face the Los Angeles Rams in Week 1.
A B.C. First Nation is speaking up in favour of the proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.
Chief Nathan Matthew of the Simpcw First Nation says they want to address the impression that B.C.'s Indigenous communities are united in their opposition to the project.
LISTEN: The Simpcw are the latest First Nation to voice support for the Kinder Morgan pipeline
“That's why we thought it was time to let people know that there are, or there's at least one First Nation out there that has an agreement that they're willing to say we have this agreement,” they told CKNW's Lynda Steele Show.
“Obviously, we have concerns of different kinds, but it's put into an agreement and we signed that agreement.”
About one-third of the proposed project runs through the Simpcw's central-B.C. territory.
The community is a part of the Secwepemc — or Shuswap — nation, with territory running from Barriere northeast to Jasper and north beyond McBride.
The Simpcw began negotiations with Trans Mountain parent company Kinder Morgan about a benefits-sharing agreement in 2015.
“It took two years of understanding what the pipeline is about, and the way it was going to be built, and the various risks that were going to be associated with it, so we were able to do our own environmental studies and to address anything that we thought was important in the agreement, and we did that,” they said.
“And we had community involvement… and we got to a point where we thought, ‘Well, we agree given the conditions we negotiated into the agreement.'”

According to Trans Mountain, of the more than 133 Aboriginal communities and groups with an interest in the pipeline or interests potentially affected by it, 43 have signed benefit agreements. Thirty-three of those groups are in B.C.
The Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion has a list of 53 First Nations in B.C. that are against the project, including the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh who have vocally led opposition on the South Coast.
WATCH: First Nation leader says ‘Rights as a nation… have not been met or honoured' on pipeline
Matthew said in addition to a direct financial consideration written into the deal, their community expects to see other economic benefits from the pipeline.
Simpcw members would be in line for construction work, training and the opportunity to bid on contracts, they said.

“If the project doesn't go, there would be quite a number of contracts… and people wouldn't have the opportunity to work or contract to all of the different pieces of the construction,” they said.
As for the province's handling of the project, Matthew said they believe Premier John Horgan has “handled it in the way that their party has determined to be appropriate.”
Matthew said in setting its own conditions on the project, the B.C. government has found itself in a political conflict with Alberta and Ottawa, however, they said that was a problem for Horgan and other politicians to solve.
“We've made our decision, and we've followed a process that we've followed in other natural resources in our territory,” they said.

MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Russian central bank said on Friday it expected gross domestic product to grow by between 1.0 percent and 1.5 percent in the first half of 2018. (Reporting by Oksana Kobzeva; writing by Maria Kiselyova; Editing by Christian Lowe)
Detroit Red Wings Niklas Kronwall (55), Martin Frk (42), Mike Green (25) surround goaltender Petr Mrazek (34) following the teams 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes, Friday in Raleigh, N.C. Karl B DeBlaker  The Associated Press
RALEIGH, N.C. >> After two months of struggles, Darren Helm finally had the breakout game hes been seeking.
Helm had a goal and two assists, Petr Mrazek stopped 36 shots, and the Detroit Red Wings beat the Carolina Hurricanes 4-1 on Friday night.
Helms goal was their first since Dec. 5, and they also had their first multi-assist game of the season.
It feels great, Helm said. I dont know if I played a whole lot better than I had in previous games, but its definitely nice when the puck finally gets in the back of the net, either by myself or given to teammates.

Gustav Nyquist, Danny DeKeyser and Trevor Daley also scored for the Red Wings, who won their second straight after dropping six of eight.
Helm was at the center of it all, assisting on DeKeysers tying goal and Daleys go-ahead score before finding the net themselves on a breakaway late in the third period.
He was buzzing, said Red Wings forward Henrik Zetterberg, who had an assist. Hes a fast guy, strong. It was nice to see them have this game.
Sebastian Aho scored for the Hurricanes, who snapped a three-game win streak. Scott Darling made 34 saves while losing for the sixth time in their last seven starts.
We gave up too much in transition, Hurricanes coach Bill Peters said. Their transition from defense to offense is very quick and we gave up a lot of odd man rushes and a lot of shots, and on those there was quality also. I dont think we managed the puck as good as we needed to.
Ahos power-play goal midway through the first opened the scoring. Justin Faulks slap shot from the blue line nicked Mrazeks glove and fluttered over the Detroit netminders back, and Aho knocked it in the air and into the net.
Helm and the Red Wings took over from there.
DeKeyser tied it before the period was out. Aided by a screen from Frans Nielsen, DeKeyser took a pass from Helm and ripped a slap shot that beat Darling to their blocker side.
Daley put Detroit ahead 5:06 into the second. Helm came up with a Hurricanes turnover deep in their own zone, raced down the ice and dropped a pass back to Daley at the point and they wound up and fired a vicious slap shot over Darlings glove.
Nyquist provided insurance in the third when they snapped a wrister over Darlings glove with 12:15 remaining.
Helm added the final blow when they came out of the penalty box and picked up a loose puck at center ice for a breakaway, firing a slapper over Darling right in front of theirs face.
I just let it rip, Helm said. Ive struggled to put the puck in the net by making moves. I dumbed it down a little bit and it worked out.
NOTES: Mrazek improved to 4-1-1 in their last six games. ... DeKeysers goal was their first in 18 games dating back to Dec. 15. ... Hurricanes F Teuvo Teravainen set a new career-high with their 28th assist. ... The Hurricanes have 13 power-play goals in their last 14 games.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaragua's main business lobby on Wednesday urged President Daniel Ortega to hold early elections to steer the country out of weeks of deadly protests that have seriously undermined the former Marxist guerrilla leader's long hold on power.
In a letter to Ortega published on Twitter, business association COSEP urged the 72-year-old president to bring forward the next vote at a date to be agreed between the government and representatives of civic society.
"Given the magnitude of this crisis, we urge you to undertake every effort in your power to find a peaceful solution before we find ourselves immersed in an even more tragic situation," the letter said.
The next presidential election is scheduled for 2021.
Proposed changes to Nicaragua's social security system last month triggered student-led protests, and indignation at a violent crackdown in which dozens of people have been killed and over 800 injured has become a daily challenge to Ortega's rule.
Ortega told supporters that Nicaragua "is not private property" in response to the COSEP demand, according to local newspaper La Prensa.
A Cold War antagonist of the United States who served a single term as president during the 1980s, Ortega returned to power in 2007. They were re-elected by a landslide for a third consecutive term in 2016 with their wife as vice president.
The Organization of American States last week called for early elections, but Ortega has not acceded.

It has been a very busy summer, with World Championships showcasing the best swimmers on the planet last month, world records going down left and right, and a lot of fast swimming yet to come at the World University Games and the World Junior Championships.
It's time to start shifting attention to the NCAA season, though, as college swimmers nationwide are heading back to campus to shake off the summer and get down to business. We'll kick off our annual rankings for the incoming classes in the NCAA with the girls numbers 9 through 12.
Please read these notes:
The rankings numbers listed for some individuals are from our pre-recruiting season rankings done more than a full year ago. Had we re-ranked these swimmers today (including some previously-unknown internationals putting their hat in the ring), the rankings would undoubtedly be different.
Like most of our rankings, these placements are subjective. Rankings are based on a number of factors, including prospect's incoming times, team needs filled, prospect's potential upside, class size, and potential relay impact. Greater weight is placed on known success in short course yards, so foreign swimmers are slightly devalued because of their inexperience in SCY.
Transfers are included, and there were a lot of big ones this summer.

Here are the 9th-through-12th-ranked Women's NCAA Swimming & Diving classes (plus some honorable mentions), with the top 8 to follow later this week:
HONORABLE MENTIONS (NO PARTICULAR ORDER):
Mizzou
Minnesota
Ohio State
Louisville
Arizona State
#12: VIRGINIA
Top-tier additions: #18 Paige Madden, Kyla Valls, Erin Earley, Abby Richter, Emma Seiberlich
Others: Anna Pang, Marcie Maguire, Caroline Gmelich, Jocelyn Porter (diver)
The UVA women are in rebuilding mode after losing a fantastic senior class that included Olympic bronze medalist Leah Smith, All-American stroke specialists Laura Simon and Kaitlyn Jones, and key relay piece Ellen Thomas, among others. They also just had most of their coaching staff ship off to other schools, with Augie Busch taking over the Arizona program (with Cory Chitwood in tow) and Sam Busch relocating to TCU.
There's good news for UVA, though, as NC State's Todd DeSorbo will get to work as their new head coach. Meanwhile, in the pool, there is a wealth of freestyle talent heading to Charlottesville, which is going to be a huge help– all four 4×100 free relay members at NCAAs are out of eligibility.
Kyla Valls and Paige Madden are both fantastic 200 freestylers (1:45.6 for Madden, 1:45.9 for Valls) that will likely join the 4×200 free relay immediately. Both will be powerful in other events, as Valls has been 49.9 and 22.8 in the sprints and Madden can extend to the 500 (4:42.1) and has a great 200 back (1:55.0). While Madden hasn't hit best times recently, Valls has some momentum after going a lifetime best 2:00.9 in the 200 free long course at the US Open, and both they and Madden will be a big freestyle boost to the program. Additionally, Singaporean Anna Pang brings more sprint free power with a 26.0 in long course in the 50 free.
Like Madden, Erin Earley is more distance-oriented, with a 16:08 mile and a 4:46 in the 500, while she's been a 1:54.2 in the 200 back. The 200 back will be a strong point for UVA– Abby Richter is a 1:54.8 200 backstroker who excels in IM as well (1:58.3/4:14.1), while Emma Sieberlich is yet another swimmer under 1:55 at 1:54.9.
#11: ALABAMA
Top-tier additions: Leonie Kullmann, Flora Molnar
Others: Amy Stevens (diver), Bean Faunce, Julia Kukla, Kaila Wong, Kathryn Nicholson, Leonie Kullmann, Lydia Jackson, Mallory Underwood, Maria Reed, Nicole Smith, Sezin Eligul, Sydney Dawson, Tori van Buskirk
This is a gigantic class for ‘Bama, a school that is trying to get their women's team on par with recent success from their men's program. The big names are German mid-distance freestyler Leonie Kullmann and Hungarian sprinter Flora Molnar. Both women swam for their respective countries at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, and they have some very impressive long course times that put them at the top of all incoming freshmen in the entire NCAA for this season.
Kullmann has been as fast as 1:58.6 in the 200 LCM free and 4:11 in the 500 free. Them 200 is very strong; it would've been 11th at the 2017 U.S. Worlds Trials for some context. Them times convert to 1:43.98 and 4:42.16, and if they can hit those times in short course, she'd be far and away Alabama's best swimmer in both events. Them 200 converted time would've also been fast enough to win the 2017 title in the uber-competitive SEC.
Molnar is more sprint-based, with really impressive speed in the 50's. She's been 32.1 breast, 26.1 fly, and 24.9 free in long course– they could feasibly swim any of those legs on a medley relay, and considering ‘Bama's 200 medley legs were 28.3 breast and 23.8 fly at NCAAs last year, she'll probably be a significant upgrade on either of those strokes. Molnar has also been 54.9 in the 100m free and 59.3 in the 100m fly, so if they can translate into short course, she'll be one of the best and most versatile sprinters in the SEC.
While Kullmann and Molnar are really impressive prospects, they have yet to prove themselves in yards, which is why ‘Bama isn't ranked any higher. The Crimson Tide also doesn't have a ton of impact players in their big class, although Austrian Julia Kukla (56.8/2:01 free LCM) is another nice pickup.
#10: NC STATE
Top-tier additions: Julia Poole, Tamila Holub, Olivia Calegan, Jacquee Clabeaux, Summer Finke (transfer), Lexie Lupton (transfer)
Others: Maddie Morello, Miranda Donley, Olivia Fisher, Kate Moore, Danika Huizinga, Anna Shumate
Like Alabama, this is another big class. NC State continues to have stronger and stronger classes coming in, and this one has two key transfers to note.
Summer Finke and Lexie Lupton come by way of Florida State and Texas A&M, respectively, and both have NCAA experience, making them proven assets for the Wolfpack. They're on opposite ends of the distance spectrum, with Finke's best event being the mile and Lupton's the 50 free. Finke had a great summer, finishing top 8 in both the 1500 and 800 at Worlds Trials in Indy. Them long course times (16:22/8:34/4:12) from this summer are much more impressive than their SCY bests (16:17/9:46/4:47), suggesting that she'll be riding an improvement curve into the 2017-18 season. Lupton, meanwhile, has been a key 200 free relay pieces for the Aggies, and she's split sub-22 in the past.
For the freshmen, Portuguese Olympian Tamila Holub is right on par with Finke in long course (16:20/8:36/4:14). Considering the development of senior Hannah Moore in the distance races, the coaching staff will get two more distance aces with big potential in Finke and Holub, making for a continued tradition of distance excellence in Raleigh. Speaking of Moore, their sister Kate will be joining the Wolfpack as a 53.9/1:56.4 backstroker as well as a 2:00/4:13 IM'er.
The Wolfpack will get a breaststroke boost with Jacquee Clabeaux and Olivia Calegan, as Clabeaux has been 1:00.8 and Calegan 1:01.5 in the 100, while the former has been 1:09 in long course and is the 11-12 NAG record-holder in the 50m breast. This is really big for NC State, as All-American breaststroker Kayla Brumbaum just exhausted their eligibility after last season.
Finally, Julia Poole is one of the best 200 IM'ers in the entire incoming NCAA class, having been 1:57.1. They would've been #2 on the team with that time last year, and she's also been 4:13 in the 400 IM and 2:12 in the 200 breast.
#9: GEORGIA
Top-tier additions: #1 Courtney Harnish, Sammie Burchill, Olivia Anderson, Danielle Dellatorre
Others: Donna Blaum, Emmaline Peterson, Kayla Tennant, Maddie Wallis
A solid UGA class is spearheaded by our #1 pick Courtney Harnish, who is very dangerous in the 200 free (1:44.7), 500 free (4:39.1), and 200 fly (1:54.3). Harnish is also an exceptional distance freestyler, IM'er, and 100 flier/backstroker– there's not much that Harnish can't do. Of all of the first-year student we've talked about (not including transfers), Harnish is the first who is fast enough to score at NCAAs– with their lifetime bests, they would've scored in the 200 fly A final and B finals of the 500 free and 200 free.
That's pretty huge; just getting a newcomer who can score in the NCAA B final of one event would be big for a team, but she's able to supply a lot of speed across multiple events. Besides their best events, she's also a 52.8 flier, 53.7/1:54 backstroker, and 16:05 miler, so they will be a huge plus in dual meets who can also help out in medley relays and the 800 free relay.
Sammie Burchill will join sister Veronica in Athens this season. She's the best SCY 200 IM'er in the class besides Stanford's Brooke Forde at 1:56.6, and they are also a strong backstroker (53.7/1:56.8) to go along with that. There aren't many places better than UGA or better coaches than Jack Baurle for IM development, so Burchill could rapidly improve into a team leader in just a season or two with the ‘Dawgs. The same goes for Danielle Dellatorre, a 1:59.9 IM'er who also goes 1:01.6 breast and 49.9 free. She's going to be a helpful addition for their breaststroke group, but UGA is still going to be without a thunderous sprint breaststroker this season.
The final big addition is Canadian distance specialist Olivia Anderson, the 2016 Jr Pan Pac silver medalist in the 1500 free. She's just a bit faster than the NC State additions Holub and Finke (16:18/8:32), and she's following in UGA distance star Brittany Maclean's footsteps. Anderson trains with coach Kevin Thorburn at Etobicoke Swimming, which is where Maclean trained before moving to Athens for their first-year student year. UGA just graduated their best distance freestyler in Rachel Zilinskas, so Anderson is arriving at an opportune time.
Jared Anderson contributed to this report.
"It kind of felt like a dream," Donato said. "I really didn't really get too warmed up because I was focused everything else."
The Blue Jackets trailed by two late in the second period before scoring three consecutive goals to take a 4-3 lead.
Just 25 seconds after Nash had given the Bruins a 3-1 lead, Milano redirected Ryan Murray's slap-pass from the right point to pull Columbus within one with just over three minutes remaining in the middle period.
Vanek tipped in a shot from the slot, tying it 5:38 into the third, and Panarin put the Blue Jackets ahead off a faceoff with 8:30 left in regulation.
However, Donato slipped a short pass from the right circle to Krejci, who got the tying goal 20 seconds later while falling to one knee.
Jenner got Columbus on the scoreboard first when they redirected Vanek's pass by Rask 4:15 into the game.
The Bruins scored three straight goals in the second to take the lead. Marchand tied it with their team-leading 31st of the season when they got the puck at the end of a 2-on-1 break, shifted to their right and tucked it behind Korpisalo 5:41 into the middle period.
Donato, a Hobey Baker Finalist after leading Harvard in scoring this season, pushed Boston ahead with a one-timer that slipped inside the near post from the right faceoff circle at 7:28. The leading scorer on the U.S. team at the Pyeongchang Olympics signed a two-year, entry-level contract on Sunday.
Nash's power-play goal increased it to 3-1 as they banged home a rebound from the top of the crease with 3:28 remaining.
NOTES: Boston F David Pastrnak got their 70th point on Marchand's goal, matching their career-high. ... Bruins F Rick Nash was a late scratch with an upper-body injury. ... The Blue Jackets entered with the league's second-worst power play and went 0 for 2 against the Bruins. ... Local Olympians, including eight from the women's Gold medal-winning hockey team, were honoured during a ceremonial puck drop. ... Bruins captain Zdeno Chara missed their third straight with an upper-body injury. ... Columbus D Seth Jones missed their second straight with an upper-body injury.

"The members of this network will, on a collective and individual basis, become the brand ambassadors of Kerala. This network will also serve as an ideation platform for championing the cause of Kerala to become a hub for the knowledge industry," they said.
The 30 invitees are divided into six panels and the topics of discussion would include The digital future of travel & transportation', 'Data: Oil of the digital future', 'The digital future of health & sustainability', 'The digital future of education & skills', 'Technology disruption and inclusion' and 'The digital future of banking finance and retail'.
Betting that consumer demand for cold brew will percolate beyond coffee and into the RTD tea segment, Ito En North America has developed a new range of “ice-steeped” cold brew teas. The company will debut the products, which stretch across three of its brands — matcha LOVE, TEAS' TEA Organic and Oi Ocha — at the upcoming Natural Products Expo West 2017.
“Our main focus will be on capitalizing what we think is a big trend that extends across a lot of consumer segments of cold brew,” said Jim Hoagland, the chief operating officer of Ito En North America.
Ito En already markets bottled cold brew tea in Japan and has done so for approximately 10 years. The products are sold exclusively in the summer and continue upon a long tradition of cold brewing tea in Japan, Hoagland said.
In the U.S., however, cold brew tea is relatively untested: a handful of early-stage brands, including Evy Tea and Cham have products on the market, while established companies Suja and Harmless Harvest have each launched and discontinued lines in recent years. Ito En's entry marks the first time a major tea company has introduced a line dedicated to cold brew.
“We've had cold brew tea in our innovation roadmap for the past few years,” Hoagland said. “We just think now's the right time for us to launch a cold brew [in the U.S.] because the coffee category has really educated consumers about the benefits of cold brew. We want to build on that education and that momentum launching cold brew teas.”
Ito En brews the drinks using a proprietary process in which tea is steeped using a combination of ice and cold water for an extended period of time; Hoagland declined to say how long the process takes. The company claims that technique “draws out a more nuanced and pure flavor” than traditional brewing methods.
Communicating the ice-steeped aspect of the company's processing method will be key to building awareness and educating consumers as to the differences between cold and hot brewed tea. Hoagland pointed to product labels which use a large font to identify the drinks as cold brew as the first step in that communication. Ito En will also use a combination of social media, digital marketing and key influencers to generate awareness.
The new products include two matcha LOVE varieties, Matcha + Green Tea (unsweetened) and Lemon Matcha + Green Tea, two TEAS' TEA Organic products, Pure Green Tea (unsweetened) and Raspberry Black Tea, and Oi Ocha Cold Brew. They will be line priced — Teas' Tea and Oi Ocha at $1.99 and matcha Love at $2.39 — and begin shipping to retailers in May.

Indian TV channels seem very furious over FIR being lodged against Major Aditya and others. It is possible only in this part of the world that nobody is talking about loss of three innocent teenagers but lodging FIR against army has become the talking point. Not only that TV channels expect their TRPs to go up by abusing, insulting and discrediting Kashmiris but they believe that their shouting makes them more loyal than the king and masses in the motherland see them as saviors of India's unity, nationalism and patriotism. However, nobody tells a common Indian about the other side of the story which reveals that Indian media is doing exactly what Pakistan would have dreamed and begged them to do. Thousands of Kashmiris watching Indian TV channels everyday draw the conclusion from every single word being displayed on the screen that India and Kashmir are two different things.
Not only their alienation towards New Delhi increases but their anti India emotions and helplessness compels few brave hearts to join the armed struggle. Denying even nominal justice to Kashmiris gives anti India lobby effective weapon in their hands to oppose every single institution, party and individual who believe in fighting either within the system or the Gandhian way. Indian channels are giving Pakistani establishment enough material to increase venom and hate against New Delhi in the hearts and minds of every Kashmiri.
AFSPA never prevents a station house officer (SHO) from lodging an FIR against army in any incident but when someone not below the rank of CM reveals is like breaking news in the assembly that they have talked to Indian Defense Minister Nirmala Sita Raman and they have been kind enough to agree lodging an FIR against accused, it gives a lot of pain. If Mehbooba Mufti, rather directing SHO to lodge the FIR needs to beg Nirmala Sitaraman to do so, then let there be no confusion that not only the credibility and competence of Mehbooba Mufti but of the entire mainstream politics gets dashed to earth. When pictures of injured army jawans in alleged stone pelting are displayed on TV screens and retired generals, defense experts and political leaders are provoked to abuse innocent Kashmiris, it must be bringing a lot of joy on the face of Pakistani policymakers who deal with Kashmir for the reasons that these pictures create anger even in the minds of 80 years old Kashmiris. May these TV anchors explain that if the victims at Shopian and elsewhere have gone for some picnic to a foreign country and are expected to return soon so these anchors don't even mention about their deaths.
The FIR against army would have been helpful to the state than the people as New Delhi through its media would have used it to send a notion within and outside India that it treats Kashmiris as its own people and Indian army is not there to kill but has some accountability. The FIR would die its own death for more than one reasons, however, the huge hue and cry raised by Indian media and rightwing forces has made a common Kashmiri to think that if FIR really matters then why has not been any FIR lodged against army or other security forces in hundreds of cases similar to that of Shopian incident.
One can understand the difficult circumstances Army is working in but does it mean that the deaths and killings at their hands should be celebrated and every word spoken by men in uniform is like if angels have spoked from heavens. With National Media adding salt to the injuries of Kashmiris, the state assembly which is in session in Jammu has made a joke of its authority. Any debate over killings or sensitive issues is within the competence and the fundamental duty of the Assembly, but it has to take the issues to the logical end and not make just hue and cry just to give cover to the shameful incidents. The assembly could have taken a much bigger decision in ensuring justice to Shopian victims and it would have given this institution some credibility but it seems that the assembly is being forced to work as an extension wing of security agencies and has just to manage the crises and facilitate in implementing New Delhi's vicious designs.

ALTAMONTE SPRINGS | At the start of the new year when people are making a variety of resolutions to improve their body, mind and soul, a ministry at St. Mary Magdalen Parish in Altamonte Springs offers an opportunity to integrate and nourish all three aspects.
Four years ago, parishioner Rosemary George applied for a grant to build a community learning garden as part of their parish's Health and Wellness Ministry goals. “It began with a group of nurses and health care professionals who wanted to do something for the mind, body and spirit,” George said. “The day we put the garden in, we had 85 people show up.”
Fellow nurse and parishioner, Terri Bormet, manages the garden on a daily basis. “For me, working in the garden grounds me,” they said. “It puts me into a calm place. I feel spiritually touched. It's like church.”
Much like a sacred space, which feeds the body, mind and soul, the garden, “is a place to share cultures, grow and share with other people,” Bormet said. “It's a wonderful merging of differing ideas and thoughts. And just like faith you tend it, you care for it, you love it. It will give back to you abundantly.”
And they are not alone. Amidst the noise and technology-driven pace of life, Bormet said, “There are people who just come over and sit in the garden. They find it a place of spiritual comfort. It's a place where they can come to be still.”
The garden has grown everything: varieties of lettuce, onions and tomatoes to sugar cane, pink popcorn, Korean vegetables and cotton. The gardeners have grown enough cotton to have an altar cloth made, which is currently in the works. The produce that is generated is shared among the parish community and gardeners.
Recalling a Korean parishioner who brings seeds to plant from their home country, Bormet said, “She teaches us. They are things that we don't know what to do with, unless they tell us. It's fascinating. We are learning to appreciate other people. You learn to listen and appreciate the fact that someone is willing to share their ideas with you.”
The learning garden was intentionally designed to be handicap-friendly. Bormet credits George with the idea. “There is one raised bed so that people in wheelchairs can come,” they explained. “It is a specific sensory bed — a place for sensory gifts. Everything you touch in there just feels and smells wonderful. And of course, it looks pretty.”
Bormet finds many parallels between cultivating a healthy garden and cultivating a healthy faith life.
“It's wonderful to plant and it's wonderful to harvest, but there is the time in between where you are tending the garden,” Bormet explained. “You are weeding and watering. It sort of reminds me of what we need to do as far as our faith. You need to weed, you need to water, you need to feed it.”
In the same way that sharing one's faith inspires others on their journey and spreads the good news, enthusiasm about the learning garden has encouraged others to try their hand at gardening.
“Once people take things home, they start gardens of their own. Many friends and family who have never been to the garden have been inspired to start their own gardens,” Bormet said.
St. Mary Magdalen's learning garden is open to volunteers on Wednesdays at 9 a.m., but Bormet tries to make themselves available for people if they would like to come on other days. It is a place to learn to plant, care for and reap your harvest — be it vegetables or faith.
Describing what the garden represents for her, they said, “It's one of those places where I feel quiet joy. I am comforted when I go there. I just love it. When I think of the garden, it makes me smile. I just can't help it.”
Fun response from Adrian Peterson on people thinking that receiving isn't part of their repertoire: "I've been playing ball since I was 7 years old, I can catch a football." Also pointed out they had their best receiving years with Brett Favre, and now he's with Drew Brees. Video by Mike Triplett (0:32)
METAIRIE, La. -- Adrian Peterson might not become the next Darren Sproles or Reggie Bush now that he's with the New Orleans Saints.
But the future Hall of Famer would like to set the record straight on one of the critiques they have heard about their game over the years.
Yes, they can catch the football.
"It's always funny to me. ... It's like a lot of people say, 'Well, they can't catch the ball.' And I'm like, 'I've been playing ball since I was 7 years old, I can catch a football,'" Peterson said. "I don't let it frustrate me too much. But I'd be lying to ya to say it's not nerve-wracking to hear people say, 'He can't catch the ball. What are they gonna do in this offense because they pass so much?'"
Peterson -- who has 11,747 career rushing yards and 97 rushing touchdowns vs. 1,945 receiving yards and five receiving TDs -- explained that they just aren't used in that role much with the Minnesota Vikings. But they pointed out that they had their two best receiving seasons in the two years that they played with quarterback Brett Favre (436 yards in 2009 and 341 in 2010).
"So it's all about having a guy that's gonna get the ball to you. And without a doubt, I know [Drew] Brees will be doing that," Peterson said.

When asked why they think that would make such a difference -- since inexperienced quarterbacks probably rely on check-down passes to running backs as much as anyone -- Peterson explained, "You've got different quarterbacks that see the field differently."
"A lot of quarterbacks, when they go through their progression, they're stuck on one side. They're not seeing the backside checkdown or me leaking out in the flat or a back leaking out in the flat," Peterson said. "You've got guys like Favre and Drew Brees who are Hall of Famers, they're Hall of Famers for a reason. Not only can they throw the ball, but they have other qualities that make them top-tier quarterbacks. ... You've got a guy who knows what's going on, they know every guy's position and where they're supposed to be."
Most likely, Peterson's primary role will be as a runner and a base-down back in New Orleans, both because that's their strength and because Mark Ingram is excellent as a pass protector and solid as a pass-catcher.
But the Saints do a ton of passing, and they like all of their backs to be versatile. And that appealed to Peterson when they were searching for a new team.
Peterson said the chance to expand their repertoire with an "amazing" QB like Brees and a "genius" offensive coach like Sean Payton is definitely one of the things that drew them to New Orleans.
"Definitely a perk to play with Drew Brees. He's amazing. I see why they have performed at such a high level for 15, 16 years. Now I'm able to see it firsthand," said Peterson, who admits that the transition to a new team for the first time in 10 years won't come overnight.
"The offense has been challenging, but I knew that coming in. Coach Payton is like a genius putting together an offensive scheme," Peterson said. "I know after minicamp I'll really be able to take that playbook home, and I'll really have to dedicate time to learning each and everything.
"I don't want that to be a reason I'm being slowed down at all, so I'm going to have to invest a lot of time in the playbook for sure."
Business starts Drive Reduced Emissions program
For drivers who want to reduce their impact on the environment, SpeedyQ Market's new Drive Reduced Emissions program aims to keep the Thumb of Michigan green.
Starting on June 1, the Drive Reduced Emissions Program, the first sustainability program of its kind in Michigan, will be available to all drivers in and around the Thumb.
SpeedyQ Markets have partnered with GreenPrint and The Arbor Day Foundation to offer a more environmentally-conscious option to their customers.
For every gallon and grade of gas pumped at SpeedyQ Markets in and around Michigan, Drive plants trees in local parks and neighborhoods and invests in certified carbon emissions reduction projects, such as greenhouse as local green-scape, reforestation, wildlife protection, and renewable energy projects, to neutralize emissions by up to 30 percent.
In addition to the carbon offsets, the Drive program will plant 5,000 trees in the Michigan area with the Arbor Day Foundation.
Children not only have fatigue-resistant muscles, but recover very quickly from high-intensity exercise — even faster than well-trained adult endurance athletes. This is the finding of new research published in open-access journal Frontiers in Physiology, which compared the energy output and post-exercise recovery rates of young boys, untrained adults and endurance athletes. The research could help develop athletic potential in children as well as improve our understanding of how our bodies change from childhood to adulthood — including how these processes contribute to the risk of diseases such as diabetes.
“During many physical tasks, children might tire earlier than adults because they have limited cardiovascular capability, tend to adopt less-efficient movement patterns and need to take more steps to move a given distance. Our research shows children have overcome some of these limitations through the development of fatigue-resistant muscles and the ability to recover very quickly from high-intensity exercise,” say Sébastien Ratel, Associate Professor in Exercise Physiology who completed this study at the Université Clermont Auvergne, France, and co-author Anthony Blazevich, Professor in Biomechanics at Edith Cowan University, Australia.
Previous research has shown that children do not tire as quickly as untrained adults during physical tasks. Ratel and Blazevich suggested the energy profiles of children could be comparable to endurance athletes, but there was no evidence to prove this until now.
The researchers asked three different groups — 8-12 year-old boys and adults of two different fitness levels — to perform cycling tasks. The boys and untrained adults were not participants in regular vigorous physical activity. In contrast the last group, the endurance athletes, were national-level competitors at triathlons or long-distance running and cycling.
Each group was assessed for the body's two different ways of producing energy. The first, aerobic, uses oxygen from the blood. The second, anaerobic, doesn't use oxygen and produces acidosis and lactate (often known by the incorrect term, lactic acid), which may cause muscle fatigue. The participants' heart-rate, oxygen levels and lactate-removal rates were checked after the cycling tasks to see how quickly they recovered.
In all tests, the children outperformed the untrained adults.
“We found the children used more of their aerobic metabolism and were therefore less tired during the high-intensity physical activities,” says Ratel. “They also recovered very quickly — even faster than the well-trained adult endurance athletes — as demonstrated by their faster heart-rate recovery and ability to remove blood lactate.”
“This may explain why children seem to have the ability to play and play and play, long after adults have become tired.”
Ratel and Blazevich explain the significance of their findings. “Many parents ask about the best way to develop their child's athletic potential. Our study shows that muscle endurance is often very good in children, so it might be better to focus on other areas of fitness such as their sports technique, sprint speed or muscle strength. This may help to optimize physical training in children, so that they perform better and enjoy sports more.”
Ratel continues, “With the rise in diseases related to physical inactivity, it is helpful to understand the physiological changes with growth that might contribute to the risk of disease. Our research indicates that aerobic fitness, at least at the muscle level, decreases significantly as children move into adulthood — which is around the time increases in diseases such as diabetes occur.
“It will be interested in future research to determine whether the muscular changes we have observed are directly related to disease risk. At least, our results might provide motivation for practitioners to maintain muscle fitness as children grow up; it seems that being a child might be healthy for us.”

Walking on stage with their signature shag and stoic manner, Jake Bugg did nothing but impress in their Dec. 5 concert at Paradise Rock Club. Their voice sounded exactly like it does in every track they have ever recorded, putting a face to all their poignant melodies. Backed by only an amp and their own guitar, Bugg relied on their own mastery as an artist to impress the 200 or so devoted fans. Bugg was not overly animated, but it's the quiet energy in their songs that attracts fans in the first place. They opened with the title song of their fourth album, “Hearts that Strain,” which dropped in September. Although they were touring for this new album, Bugg's setlist included favorites from all of their albums and even some that were never recorded in the studio. The crowd was more than happy to let the 23-year-old singer-songwriter know how much they appreciated him, and in their stoic manner they responded every time to their praises with a modest “cheers.”
Opening the concert was Boston native MB Padfield. The young artist brought energy to the show and hyped up the crowd for the night to come. Promising that none of their songs were pre-recorded, Padfield playfully explained the stories behind all of their songs and the various escapades one only expects from a rockstar. Padfield also highlighted the importance of supporting artists like themselves by coming to concerts and shows. Using a penny to highlight their point, they claimed that for every stream on Spotify, Apple Music or any other streaming service, the artist gets 1/33rd of the penny. The monetary reward is small for musicians when compared to how much hard work and dedication they put into their art, yet Padfield is hopeful for the future, and they also explained that artists were being taken advantage of less than in the past. After Padfield played their set, the crowd waited in anticipation as Bugg sauntered onto stage with what appeared to be water, but which the artist later revealed to be gin and tonic, meant to ease the nerves of performing.
As the artist said himself, they played music that their fans wanted to hear. Bugg played “Saffron” (2013), a song that they wrote before they ever even began recording and that did not make it onto any of their studio albums, but there were plenty of fans who knew the lyrics to the little-known hit, which has only been recorded in a live show. The dedicated fans knew the lyrics to even the lesser-known tracks along with crowd favorites like “Two Fingers” (2012) and “Strange Creatures” (2014), which sounded perfect, even with just an acoustic guitar.
Bugg's set had a strong bent toward ballads and slow hits, which played into their ability on the guitar. Switching guitars for almost every single song, the musician proved they were adept not only as a singer but also as a guitarist. Fans were able to see the well-known licks that they had heard a thousand times on their live albums, which Bugg pulled off tremendously.
The artist did not disappoint with their vocals either, despite admitting to waking up just an hour before the 8 p.m. performance. Bugg is already known for their unique sound, often being compared to greats like Bob Dylan, but their sound quality in the acoustic session was unbelievable. Their voice was clear and strong, as one would expect from an artist who knows their songs backward and forward. Often beginning their songs in a soft, tender voice, their quality of sound did not suffer, no matter how booming and emotional they got during the performance.
During certain songs, such as “Simple As This” (2012), which was featured in the film “The Fault in Our Stars” (2014), Bugg emphasized interacting with and scanning their audience. At the same time, the artist became entrenched in the emotion of ballads such as “Broken” (2012), and one could feel the audience pulsing along with the artist's heartbreaking lyrics and tone. In these moments, the crowd and the artist were alone together, and they would shyly smile, take a sip of their gin and tonic and offer a quick “cheers.”
LAHORE - Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif inaugurated the 100-bed Government Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Manawan on Friday.
Later, they went to various wards, checked quality of medical facilities for patients and inquired after patients. They inspected emergency wards for children and adults and talked to patients and their family members about the quality of healthcare facilities available to them at the hospital. People told the chief minister that they were getting the best treatment facilities and free of cost medicines at the hospital. They said they were being taken care of by doctors and paramedics round the clock. They thanked the chief minister for building this hospital and said that best treatment facilities were now accessible to people of the area. The chief minister also took a round of X-ray room, blood bank and other sections of the hospital.
Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Shehbaz said that a state-of-the-art hospital had been set up by the Punjab government in Manawan under the public-private partnership. They said there were basic health units and rural health centres in the area, but they were working in papers only because there were no doctors, paramedics and medicines. They said animals used to roam in the empty buildings of these health units. Due to the continuous struggle of the Punjab government, they said, the health sector had seen sufficient improvements and the situation was now better than the past. However, they said, a lot was needed to be done to serve the ailing humanity. “We are fully committed to doing even better to improve the quality of healthcare. I shall not sit idle until ordinary people get facilities at public sector hospitals on a par with facilities accessible to ultra rich people of the society,” they said.
“The hospital in Manawan is fully functional to serve the ailing humanity and I am happy that doctors, nurses and other paramedics have worn uniforms. The standard of cleanliness is also good. This hospital is a wonderful facility with regard to healthcare and a practical shape of my aspirations, which I cherished in 1997 after being elected as Khadim of people for the first time. It is satisfying to note that doctors were checking patients as if they were checking their loved ones. This passion was lacking in the past and this hospital is a living form of my dream as it is free from social evils like recommendation, strike, hooliganism or physical torture. No one will slap the MS nor will anybody talk to patients rudely,” the chief minister said.
Shehbaz said the Punjab government had ensured provision of quality medicines at public sector hospitals. They said that medicines being given to patients at government hospitals were better in terms of quality than the medicines given to patients at private hospitals. They said that hard work of last four years was bearing fruit and a marked improvement had been seen in the health sector. They said this was the first time in 70 years that patients at public sector hospitals were getting quality medicines on a par with private hospitals. Indus Health Network CEO Dr Abdul Bari said in their address that foundation of third hospital had been laid by the Punjab government and Indus Hospital. “We shall come up to expectations of the chief minister.  They are a good administrator who works really hard. Their team is good and it worked day and night,” they said.
BEST WISHES FOR CRICKET TEAM
Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their good wishes to the Pakistan cricket team for its success in the 2nd Test against Sri Lanka. They said that prayers of the nation were with the Pakistani players and it was hoped that the national cricket team would show its best performance in the 2nd Test against Sri Lanka. Pakistani players are required to perform in every field for success and they can achieve victory through hard work and passion, they concluded.
CONDOLENCE
Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif has expressed a deep sense of sorrow over the death of Maj (r) Riffat Hayat Daha, former MNA and ambassador. In their condolence message, they prayed to Allah Almighty to rest the departed soul in eternal peace and grant courage to the bereaved family to bear the loss with fortitude.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Asghar Farhadi will head the competition jury for the 24th Sarajevo Film Festival, the festival announced Tuesday. The Iranian director is fresh off the world premiere of their latest film, “Everybody Knows,” as the opener of the Cannes Film Festival earlier this month.
“Everybody Knows” will also screen in Sarajevo as part of the festival's Open Air program. The film stars Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem.
Last year's Sarajevo Film Festival saw Georgian director Ana Urushadze's “Scary Mother” take home the festival's top prize, the Heart of Sarajevo, for best feature film, which includes a €16,000 ($18,500) financial award. The five-person jury was presided over by Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco.
Farhadi won their first Oscar for best foreign-language film for their 2011 drama “A Separation.” They triumphed again, in the same category, with 2016's “The Salesman.”
The 24th Sarajevo Film Festival runs Aug. 10-17.
MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia's National Wealth Fund, which is designed to help balance the pension system, rose to $66.26 billion as of Feb. 1 from $65.15 billion as of Jan. 1, the finance ministry said on Friday.
The ministry said the fund's dollar deposits with state development bank VEB in the amount of $6.25 billion were converted into Russian roubles in January and totalled 352.65 billion roubles. After the conversion, the deposit's interest rate was set at 2.86 percent per annum.
Earlier this year, the finance ministry said it fully drained its Reserve Fund to plug budget holes by the end of 2017, ahead of switching to a new budget mechanism that would insulate the oil-dependent economy from swings on global commodity markets.
The ministry said it had decided to terminate the Reserve Fund after converting the funds denominated in foreign currency it held in the fund into roubles and channelling more than 1 trillion roubles of those funds into the budget in late 2017.

As with basically everything they do, Justin Bieber triggered a bit of a frenzy when they announced he's releasing some new music.
And it's coming very soon!
The Canadian heartthrob - who recently cancelled the rest of their Purpose world tour - posted messages on their Twitter and Instagram accounts announcing: "New music. Thursday noon."
Biebs, 23, posted artwork showing two birds holding a smiling worm, entitled Friends, which is thought to be the name of the new track.
The star's latest offering is a collaboration with producer BloodPop.

Their fans - dubbed Beliebers - have not been able to contain their excitement.
"OMG YESSSSSSSSSS I AM SO EXCITED!!!!" one person wrote on Instagram.
"It's gonna be lit as always," predicted another.
Another follower tweeted a picture of Bieber with a crown on their head alongside the caption: "Legend."
And it seems Justin is equally excited, as they shared the artwork six times on their account.
Earlier this month Bieber told fans they had called off their remaining tour dates in part because they wanted to have a "sustainable" career and future.
The singer had been touring in support of their album Purpose for 18 months, playing more than 150 shows, but axed the final 14 scheduled performances.
They became increasingly involved in the Hillsong Church.

Pouring out their heart in an open letter posted online, they said: "Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE.
"I want my career to be sustainable, but I also want my mind heart and soul to be sustainable.
"So that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be and the father I want to be."
The Sorry hit-maker wrote: "I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them!"
They added that they let "bitterness, jealousy and fear" run their life.
"I am extremely blessed to have people in the past few years help me build my character back up reminding me of who I am and who I want to be," they said.
As 3 February 2018 marks the Queer Azadi Pride March in Mumbai, we're publishing six compelling coming-out stories: first-person accounts of coming out about your sexuality or gender to friends, loved ones, colleagues or even to yourself. This interview was part of Harish Iyer's 'I'm Coming Out', published by Juggernaut Books, in which the personalities they speak with explore what it means to be gay in India.
At first glance, Sonal Giani can seem like a little girl. Them pixie haircut, delicate features and shy smile almost make them look like she's stepped out of a fairy tale. But don't be fooled. Sonal is a brat. Talking to them is as reassuring as sipping hot chocolate while watching your favourite Disney movie on a Sunday winter afternoon. They have the warmth of your grandmother's embrace and the energy of the naughtiest child in your neighbourhood. Sonal is incredible in so many different ways that I lose track of time whenever we talk. Truly amazing.
Sonal grew up in the sunshine state of Goa with their almost identical twin sister, Rupa. They grew up answering the usual questions — who popped out first? How do people tell you and Rupa apart? But people who know the twins well will say they look very different. Sonal had a regular school life, complete with love notes exchanged between childhood crushes. In fact, their first crush was a boy in their class. They were captivated by them and would often talk about them to their sister. A few years later they felt the same rush of emotions, but this time for a girl.
I interrupt Sonal to ask her, ‘How old were you then?'
‘Around the time I hit puberty,' they reply.
Sonal could not understand what they were feeling or why they were feeling this way. They go on to explain. ‘I would talk to Rupa about my girl crush in school every day. Without putting much thought into it, they asked me why I kept talking about this girl all the time and “if I was a lesbian”. They asked this laughingly. They had no idea it would affect me so much that I would not come out to them for the next seven years for fear of being made fun of.' They smile.
And to make things more complicated, this was the first time Sonal had heard the word ‘lesbian' and it fueled them curiosity. They wanted to find out more. But they led a simple life in a quiet town where there were no visible support groups for women with sexualities other than heterosexual. (She and I hate to use the word ‘alternate' because for us our lives are not ‘alternate'.)
Things took a one-eighty-degree turn when Sonal enrolled in college in Goa. The college crowd was ‘cooler' and better informed. Also, the people were more liberated and their inhibition levels were lower in college than in school. Sonal felt more comfortable exploring their sexuality. They didn't know it was called ‘exploring sexuality' then, but well, at that age, who does? We only give such complex names once we grow up
Sonal is attracted to both sexes. When I ask them to explain their bisexuality, pat comes their reply, ‘I have been attracted to men since puberty and continue to be till this day. I've had some wonderful relationships with men and women, both of which have helped me explore my sexuality to its fullest.'
I want to provoke them into sharing more, so I ask them mischievously, ‘So basically, you are a lesbian?'
As expected they get a little pissed. ‘Harish, stop it! It is not funny,' they say. ‘I feel misunderstood, misrepresented and violated when I keep getting called a lesbian even after clearly expressing that I am bisexual.' They continue, ‘Right from the start, in school, I had crushes on both boys and girls. I have had sexual and romantic urges for both sexes. I have dated and been in enough relationships with many men and woman over the years to be sure of my sexuality. I find both sexes attractive…do you get it?'
‘But you know, when you go out on a date with a woman or a man – more so when it's a same-sex thing – it becomes the talk of the town.'
As if they had done something exotic, rumours soon started floating about Sonal and their ‘girlfriends'. They left a bitter taste. It was natural that they turned wary about coming out of the closet, even though they wanted to.
After college, Sonal got a job in Mumbai and finally felt they were in the right place. They wanted help understanding their sexuality and this city gave them that opportunity without questioning or judging them Sonal started meeting other women like them through online groups and through common friends they met at work. They started interacting with women's groups and support groups. They felt more comfortable and confident. But their peace was soon shattered.
‘I was working at a hotel where people started talking about my sexuality behind my back. Every day somebody from the staff would scribble obscenities on the elevator doors. One day all my female colleagues walked out of the locker room together the moment I entered,' Sonal recalls.
There was bullying, intimidation, and worst of all, no support from their employers. While the hotel did have a sensitisation programme for employees on how to treat people with alternate sexualities, the same courtesy was not extended to Sonal because they aren't officially ‘out'.
One night, when Sonal was on their way home from work, things took an ugly turn. It was very late and Sonal took the office drop car. They were the last to be dropped and realised the driver had missed a turn. They told them to turn around but they ignored them and kept driving, missing the next turn too. Sonal thought they had either forgotten where they lived or had not heard them They bent over the back rest of the driver's seat to speak with them and they responded by showing them a pornographic clip on their cellphone. Sonal felt paralysed by fear and broke into a cold sweat as they realised the driver had essentially kidnapped them and was driving them down a lonely stretch of the highway with the intention of sexually assaulting them
Sonal's reflexes kicked in and they asked the driver to take them to a McDonald's further down the road. Sonal went in, grabbed a coffee which calmed their nerves, and boldly marched back to the driver, ordering them to drive their home. The driver was taken aback by their lack of fear and assertion of authority even in the face of adversity. They meekly drove them back home. The next day Sonal complained to their superiors, and they merely asked them why they alone seemed to be the target of such occurrences, indirectly suggesting that they were responsible for everything.
But Sonal gained their strength from these experiences. Of course they were upset. Of course they were dejected. But they did not ever lose hope of the larger goal.
They switched jobs. It took a long time to get over the trauma and Sonal went through an emotional rollercoaster for several months. After some time, they joined The Humsafar Trust, an organisation that works for the rights of LGBTIQ people. Working with fellow LGBT people and helping them cope became Sonal's way to heal herself.
Gradually, they started dating again. Over time, they met Upasana, an equally amazing person.
‘I met Upasana online and we became friends. Upasana lived in Pune at the time and was making a short trip to Mumbai. We decided to meet. I forgot all about it and ended up hanging out with another woman,' says Sonal.
When Upasana called them and told them they were waiting, Sonal ended up dragging their current date to go meet Upasana…and Cupid struck! They moved in together and now play mommies to three little kittens.
Sonal's family had an inkling of their sexuality, especially their mother. When I prod Sonal for more information about this, they get a little irritated. But they can hardly hide any emotions with a tell-all face like hers. Sipping coffee, they say, ‘My mother saw my deep friendships and unusual closeness to friends. They would see me calling them and chatting with them late into the night.'
I still remember Sonal from a Gay Bombay Parents Meet. They had been reduced to tears while speaking about them coming out experience. That was the first time I had ever heard a woman talking about their own coming out.
‘When I came out to my dad, they told me that they accept me and loves me the way I am. They were even willing to come to the pride march with me to show their support. Hearing those words from them made me cry for a very long time because it felt like years of my emotional burden were finally lifted,' said Sonal.
It was surprising to me at this stage that Sonal still hadn't come out to their extended family. I was shocked when they told me how they finally did this.
They laugh, saying, ‘It happened on TV. That's when EVERYONE got to know.'
Sonal was featured on a reality TV show called Connected Hum Tum. They were followed by a camera for a year. The show recorded the most intimate details of their life, including their relationship with Upasana. It was then that their relatives started trying to understand them Gradually, everyone welcomed Upasana into the family. Today, whenever Sonal's mother visits the couple, Sonal often finds their mother and their girlfriend chatting nineteen to the dozen. Upasana is a bomb of a person herself. Together, the couple have a child; I mean, a feline child. Sonal quips just as any doting pet parent would, ‘The family is complete.'
Sonal spent years at The Humsafar Trust helping frightened young LGBT people deal with legal emergencies. Often, gay and lesbian people are blackmailed by people they date. The blackmailer asks for money or threatens to tell the cops about their homosexuality. Given how Section 377 criminalises ‘sex against the order of nature', it gives an impetus to a lot of extortion. People end up at police stations. Sonal meticulously wears the badge of the LGBT warrior and swings into action, no less than a mythical character. They have built a respectable relationship with the Mumbai police as they are usually the one getting police permissions for the Gay Pride Parade and other LGBT events.  They are always there at police stations whenever an LGBT person is reported as harassed or blackmailed.
But Sonal has now moved on to more creative endeavours. After leaving their much-loved job at The Humsafar Trust, they started work with Paro Devi Pictures. A TV show and two movies with a strong feminist agenda later, Sonal now wants to take up filmmaking fulltime.
Sonal is my favourite activist. I am deeply inspired by them Them message to those who haven't come out but want to be this: ‘Queer women should come out only when they feel safe. They should aspire to be financially independent and complete their education before telling parents about any ongoing relationships.'

YAMHILL, Ore. -- In the small, Willamette Valley town of Yamhill, not much has changed over the years. Its rolling hills are still quilted with crops, and its narrow streets are still rarely ever jammed.
But change is coming. In fact at Yamhill Carlton High School, change has arrived; their name is Heather Roberts.
Roberts, 49, is Yamhill Carlton High School's new, varsity boys basketball coach and will also serve as the middle school's dean. Roberts was believed to be the first woman to hold such a coaching job in Oregon, since the 1930's.
“It's kind of exciting!” said Roberts. “It's something I've thought about for a while, so for it to come about now it's kind of surreal.”
The Corvallis native and Oregon State University graduate has coached girls basketball teams at high schools across the state, including Ashland, Canby, Lakeridge and Sprague. Four years ago, Roberts took over the women's team at Southern Virginia University. When the Yamhill-Carlton job posted in April, Roberts was the only woman to apply.
“It's not about making history,” said Yamhill Carlton Athletic Director, Matt Wiles. “We had a very quality pool of applicants and Heather rose to the top, just based on their experience… we hired the best person for that job.”
Roberts said they aren't intimidated by the historic nature of their hire.
“Basketball's basketball and I think if you're a good coach, you care about kids, you work them hard, and have high standards, it doesn't matter if you're a male or a female,” said Roberts.
Minutes into the team's first summer ball practice on Tuesday, players realized what they were getting in Roberts.
“She knows what she's doing,” observed sophomore, Ramon Avila.
“I thought... this is gonna be different,” said first-year student, Hunter Stephenson.
“Yeah, she's going to be super tough on us this year,” added junior, Joey McGhehey. “That's what we need.”
Roberts didn't deny it.
“One [student] asked me in the interview, ‘do you believe in conditioning?' and I started laughing,” chuckled Roberts. “I said, ‘oh yes, we will condition!'”
The Tigers won just three games during their 2017-18 season—a record they hope to improve upon this winter. They will hit the court as a newly reclassified 3A team, in a newly-constructed gym, and under a new coach.
“We are thrilled to get the caliber of coach and experience [Roberts] brings,” said Wiles. “It's a good time to be a Tiger.”
It seems change has indeed come, to Yamhill.
“I like building programs," said Roberts. "I like seeing kids get better.”

Mya Williamson of Moncton knows all about having to be brave. The 12-year-old was diagnosed with a brain tumor on their pituitary gland and had to undergo two complex brain surgeries at only 7 years of age
“It was freaky because it was something new and scary,” Williamson said.
It's been five years since Mya's tumor was removed and, except for a few complications, their overall health is good. But, their dad Mike Williamson still worries about their health.

Guided by their daughter's fearlessness however, they choose instead to focus on what they are now doing to help others.
“You know they have taught us a lot about not complaining and helping others,” said Mike.
Which they are now doing one stone at a time.
For the past year, Mya has been making what they call “Mya's Brave Stones,” which are colourful magnets they craft themselves and sells for a few bucks a piece, donating the money to the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax.
The brave stones are made from glass, are hand-painted with nail polish and glitter, and to Mya represent courage, which they hope to pass on to others, they said especially sick kids.
“They can look at these and say ‘I can be brave,'” Williamson said.

Mya has already sold more than a thousand brave stones and wants to sell at least 2,000 more.
But what is most impressive is what they want to do long-term to raise money for sick kids.
Them brave stones are the tip of the iceberg so to speak: Mya has been raising money for sick kids since they were three-years-old and she's already raised $32,000. They have set a lifetime goal to raise, in their words, “like a quarter-of-a-million dollars before I pass away.”
The Vancouver Canucks finished 29th in the NHL last season and struggled in just about every aspect of the game, especially the power play. In the past two seasons, the Canucks scored on 15% of their power plays — the worst percentage in the league.
The problem boils down to a few areas ranging from shot attempts to what side players are shooting from on the power play. It was hard to watch last season, especially as none of the Canucks' coaching staff could fix the problems.
A few off-season signings and the development of a handful of players over the past year has breathed life into the Canucks' special teams and they will find success this season.
“ Vancouver Canucks: 3 Stats that must improve in 2018 https://t.co/xo8rGWfyML via @fsthecanuckway pic.twitter.com/FxFIwBfzpu — FanSided NHL (@FanSidedNHL) September 7, 2017 ”
The Problems
In the 2015-16 season, the Canucks finished 28th in the NHL in shots on goal with 2,311. Last season, they dropped to dead last with a meager 2,273. You can't score if you don't shoot, so naturally, the Canucks ranked 29th in goals scored during the 2016-17 season. This was even more apparent on their dismal power play that had no true shooters.
Also, having a blend of righties and lefties on your power play and using them effectively is pivotal to success. The Canucks did not do this in the slightest and often tried to force predictable shots. Having players on their off-wing sitting on the hash marks is what makes a power play work in this NHL era.
For example, look at the 2016-17 Pittsburgh Penguins who had Evgeni Malkin (lefty) on the right hash marks and Phil Kessel (righty) on the left hash marks. This opened them up for one-timers on both sides and gave the power play flexibility to move the puck. They made defenders wary while getting goaltenders to move laterally. The Penguins finished second in the NHL in power play goals, and of course went on to hoist the Stanley Cup.
Perhaps the Canucks' biggest issue on the power play was the zone entry — my goodness was it ever predictable. How many times did Daniel or Henrik Sedin pick the puck up behind the net, skate up to center and then drop it for Alex Edler to take into the zone? This tactic can be viable but only if your puck carrier heads up ice with speed and purpose like Dustin Byfuglien of the Winnipeg Jets.
The Solutions
Obviously, the only way to increase the Canucks' shot totals is by shooting the puck more. Showing confidence in players like Brock Boeser, Sven Baertschi and Bo Horvat should have them directing more pucks at the cage.
Additionally, bringing in players like Sam Gagner and Thomas Vanek was a huge step in the right direction for a successful power play. Gagner and Vanek are both right-handed shots with plenty of skill and proven abilities for hitting the score sheet.
On that same note, the development of righties like Troy Stecher and Boeser will increase the balance of righties and lefties and offensive production on the roster. Being a defenceman, Stecher's development as a right-handed shot is vital for the future of the Canucks' production on the back end.
There is no definitive solution to the Canucks' predictability entering the zone. However, I'd start by not letting Edler quarterback the power play. He's a good player but they are not fast enough nor talented enough to weave through traffic with the puck on a string and establish a setup. Stecher has the speed and is developing their skill to a point where they just might be the new quarterback.
We'll have to see how coach Travis Green handles the strategic elements of the power play but the new-found balance of skilled righties and lefties is perhaps just what they need to orchestrate a successful power play. It won't be the best power play in the league, but it has the potential to jump to a middle-of-the-pack position — a huge leap from being the worst.

Day Four Report: Bangladesh faces an uphill task of saving the opening Test in Chittagong after the Sri Lankan spin trio of Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera and Lakshan Sandakan struck late on Day Four.
Bangladesh reached 81-3 at stumps, still needing 119 to make Sri Lanka bat again. The visitors declared their first innings at 713-9 in the final session.
Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera dismissed Imrul Kayes for 19 before left-arm unorthodox bowler Lakshan Sandakan got Tamim Iqbal caught behind for 41.
Herath then removed Mushfiqur Rahim for two with their left-arm spin in the last over of the day.
Mominul Haque — 18 not out — was at the crease when the players walked back after another run-filled day.
"We have a pretty good chance to win the Test. It is a pretty good wicket. It is all turning from the rough and outside the stumps," said Sri Lankan wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella.
"We are hoping to start the (fifth and final) day well. We are bowling in good areas, line and length."
Sri Lanka declared their innings in the third over into the final session with a lead of 200 runs in response to Bangladesh's first innings total of 513.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam, who returned figures of 4-219, took two wickets off their successive overs to wrap up the Sri Lankan innings.
Taijul got the all-important wicket of skipper Dinesh Chandimal for 87 before off-spinner Mehedi Hasan removed Dickwella for 62 to slow down the Sri Lankan progress.
"It is a batting wicket, but we didn't bowl to that level. I think they made 100 runs too many," said Taijul.
Debutant left-arm spinner Sunzamul Islam got their maiden Test wicket, trapping Dilruwan Perera leg-before for 32.
Roshen Silva joined the run-fest in the morning session to post their maiden Test century after Sri Lanka resumed on 504-3.
They made 109 off 230 balls before becoming the first batsman dismissed on the day.
Silva was Sri Lanka's third century-maker of the innings after Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva, who made 196 and 173 runs respectively.
Mehedi ended Silva's impressive innings when the right-hander edged a low delivery to wicketkeeper Liton Das.
Silva shared a 135-run stand with Chandimal for the fourth wicket and hit six fours and a six.

ANNECY, France — “Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.” Disney executives aren't that well known for phrasing verities in French, so Disney Television Animation's Eric Coleman made an impact from the get-go at France's Annecy Festival where they delivered a masterclass on Thursday. But they aren't just showing off their lingo. The truths that Coleman teased out of their vocational 25-year animation career in the masterclass would look to apply as well to 1997 as 2017. That's not because Coleman is a throwback. Rather, that the executive, who joined Disney Television Animation in 2008 after 15 years at Nickelodeon, has always been intimately connected with the craft of animation and its creators, whether spearheading development of the Emmy and Annie-winning Mickey Mouse cartoon shorts or “Gravity Falls” and more recent series “Star vs. The Forces of Evil” at DTA or as the Nick exec who championed the development and then was put in charge of production on “SpongeBob SquarePants.”
“There are changes in technology and audience habits but the fundamentals on the creative side have remained the same for me for many years,” Coleman insisted.
A Duke English graduate, Coleman – now SVP original programming and general manager, Disney Television Animation – is credited with a firm grasp on storytelling – the word they probably repeated most in their masterclass. But they ranged wider, delivering incisive insights, though in a humble, thoughtful manner, into the art of animation and its industry. Four of Coleman's guiding principles about animation:
1. GREAT ART COMES FROM GREAT ARTISTS
That may seem obvious, Coleman said. But, despite that, much animation is still not driven from a creative place, they argued. “Shows that really have connected with audiences and been the biggest hits have come from artists and teams with great vision and passion and connection to the audience,” they argued. When a great artist, such as show creator Steve Hirsch, said they couldn't go on with “Gravity Falls,” Coleman respected that and pulled the show.
2. WHAT IS THE SHOW REALLY ABOUT?
Shows that have endured have a great theme underneath it all, and tend to come from creators with a strong point of view and a real purpose in their story telling, Coleman argued. “What does a show celebrate?” Coleman asked in Annecy. They went on to give their ideas on “SpongeBob SquarePants” (“the triumph of innocence and creativity”) and “Gravity Falls” (“family over all else”).
3. IT'S NOT THE IDEA THAT COUNTS, IT'S THE EXECUTION
“Great artists can take an idea that seems common and make it seem very fresh, original,” Coleman said. They illustrated the point citing shows that started as simple familiar ideas and then took off. One was Stephen Hillenburg's “SpongeBob SquarePants,” whose pitch was “one of the best I've ever seen,” Coleman recalls. But “we heard a lot of concerns early on. SpongeBob needs to live with their parents or it doesn't make sense, if kids sing the theme it will seem like a pre-school show. For one of the first episodes Steve pitched that SpongeBob would open a bubble stand and sell them for 25 cents. I was worried it wouldn't fill the time needed. But I trusted that the execution would be there.”
4. KNOW YOUR GOAL
Know your audience, what you want to accomplish, Coleman advised. “We want to work with people who are not just interested in what they want to say but also what the audience wants to watch. When there is an overlap, great things can happen,” Coleman said.
They went on: “Alex made “Gravity Falls' with a clear goal: To entertain as broad an audience as possible. The idea of entertainment implies a relationship between the artist and audience. Know the audience, what they want, and surprise them,” they concluded, going on to screen a clip from “Gravity Falls.”
At Disney Television Animation, Coleman is responsible for growing the strongest brand in the animation business. That poses a huge challenge: How to take beloved characters and deliver them to contemporary audiences. Having screened a contemporary Mickey Mouse short, Coleman drew the biggest applause of the night world premiering the opening title sequence of Disney Television Animation's upcoming “DuckTales.”
“DuckTales” “has adventure, comedy and these great stories about a big blended family,” Coleman said at Annecy,“We knew from day one, we could not mess with the “DuckTales” theme song,”.
They went on: “That was a challenge: To make it feel fresh while being wholly faithful to the original. It's a new version of the song but in visual style we were very much trying to harken back to the old Carl Barks comics.”
The sequence included an updated version of the cherished title song – more pop-ish, from a younger and female voice – but preserving the energy of the original. The title sequence visuals included split-screen panels, vintage colors and villains from both the ‘90s series and the original comics.
But the rebooted “DuckTales” illustrates Coleman's “plus ça change…
“Binge watching on new platforms changes things for us. We are preparing for a time when everything is completely on demand. With shows like ‘Gravity Falls' and ‘DuckTales,' you can watch any show individually but collectively there are bigger story points,” Coleman reflected.
That said, they maintained, going back to their original point, “good storytelling will continue to be important. People sitting around a fire years ago were telling stories. What has changed is the technology. It impacts the language of storytelling. The way you tell stories changes but one notion doesn't – getting the attention of your audience.”

RIYADH (Reuters) - Two assailants stabbed to death a traffic police officer in the western Saudi Arabian city of Taif and then exchanged gunfire with security forces at a nearby National Guard facility, a local newspaper reported on Thursday.
The attackers stole the police officer's vehicle and service weapon before entering the military site, according to online news site Sabq, which is seen as close to the authorities. One attacker was wounded and detained while the other one fled, the report said.
Sabq reported additional injuries among the security forces without providing details.
The Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Taif is perched in the mountains just east of Mecca, the holiest site in Islam.

Lucknow: Lucknow University was closed on Wednesday till further orders after a group of students protesting over admission to the new academic session attacked teachers, injuring over a dozen of them, officials said.
Lucknow University vice-chancellor SP Singh said the youths claimed they were from the Samajwadi Party. "Over a dozen teachers were injured in the incident. I might have also been attacked by them but my colleagues saved me and I reached my office,” they told reporters. “All those involved in the incident were not Lucknow University students and were anti-social elements and outsiders claiming themselves to be Samajwadi Party workers. There were 25-30 such persons involved in the attack," they said.
"The University has been closed sine die and the counselling going on for the admissions has also been stopped. We are going to lodge an FIR in this connection against those whom we identify," the VC said. When asked when the university planned to reopen, the VC said, "It has been closed till further orders." Among the teachers injured are proctored Vinod Singh and chief provost Sangita Rani, university officials said. Some university guards were also hurt.
"Three persons have been arrested in this connection. We are awaiting a complaint by the university administration," Trans Gomti SP Harendra Kumar said. A group of over 20 ex-students had been protesting on the campus since Monday, alleging that they were denied admission to the postgraduate courses because they had taken part in an agitation against Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.
They had allegedly obstructed Adityanath's convoy and waved black flags at it in June last year, opposing their visit to the campus. The police had then arrested 11 students. Most of the students who took part in the protests against Adityanath last year were members of the left-wing All India Students' Association (AISA) and the Samajwadi Party's student wing Chhatra Sabha.
Two candidates, Pooja Shukla and Gaurav Tripathi, had also begun an indefinite hunger strike demanding admission of all students who took the entrance test last month, and whose results were allegedly held back for waving blacks flags at the chief minister. Pooja Shukla was among those who had waved black flags at the CM's convoy last year. When asked about the row over admissions, the VC said, "There are laid-down procedures for admission to the university. It cannot be given against norms." The Lucknow University Teachers Association (LUTA) has called a meeting tomorrow to discuss their next course of action.
While Lukas “Dr. Luke” Gottwald's defamation lawsuit against former protégé Kesha is still pending, their attempts to extradite themselves from contracts they signed with them and their Kemosabe label have been halted again. On Tuesday, a New York appeals court affirmed a judge's decision to reject Kesha's their counterclaims, the latest in several attempts by them to have their agreements with Gottwald terminated. The news was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.
The countersuit was first stymied in March of last year, when New York Supreme Court Justice Shirley Kornreich supported Gottwald's attorneys' argument that the singer should have provided notice of alleged contract breaches and that their allegation of the impossibility of their performing under the deals (which they claimed, due to their troubled relationship with the producer) was based upon speculation. That decision was arguably supported by the fact that Kesha released an album, “Rainbow,” has performed frequently and is setting out on tour with Macklemore this summer.
“Kesha's proposed amendments are palpably insufficient and devoid of merit,” the decision reads. “Her counterclaim seeking declaratory relief terminating the agreements on the ground of impossibility and impracticability of performance was speculative, contradicted by their own allegations that they had continued performing under the agreements and, as to at least one of the agreements, the impossibility was not produced by an unanticipated event that could not have been foreseen or guarded against.”
The court also upholds Kornreich's decision to force Kesha to surrender documents held by their publicist and former attorney, Mark Geragos.
“The communications between their counsel and press agents do not reflect a discussion of legal strategy relevant to the pending litigation but, rather, a discussion of a public relations strategy, and are not protected under the attorney-client privilege,” it reads.
A member of last season's London Knights has been charged after police radar clocked a car doing more than 180 km/h in a 100 km/h zone on Highway 401 near Chatham.
Chatham-Kent OPP say they were conducting radar enforcement on the highway near Kent Bridge Road around 1 a.m. on April 14 when they observed a westbound vehicle driving well over the posted speed limit.
Police say they have charged Joseph Raaymakers, who is from Chatham, with racing a motor vehicle.  They are scheduled to appear in court on May 23.

The Knights acquired Raaymakers in an early-season trade with Sault Ste. Marie.
Their driver's licence has been suspended and the vehicle impounded for seven days.
Chatham-Kent OPP say they would like to remind drivers that stunt driving or racing is one of the most serious and reckless forms of aggressive driving, and it puts everyone on the road at serious risk of injury or death.
Police say penalties for driving more than 50 km/h over the posted speed limit include an immediate seven-day licence suspension and seven-day impound of their vehicle.

For a first-time conviction, the individual can face a fine up to $10,000, lose six demerit points, serve up to six months in jail and have their licence suspended for up to two years.
If convicted for a second time in 10 years, the driver's licence could be suspended for up to 10 years.
A Christmas calf show organised by agriculture students from Myerscough College has helped boost funds for charity.
Students plan and prepare for the event months in advance and college Head of Agriculture Craig Thompson, said: “All the students have done fantastically well. You could really see the effort they had gone to in preparation for the competition. It made a thoroughly entertaining spectacle.”
Christmas calf show
The event was staged at Lodge Farm at Myerscough's new Livestock Innovation Centre.
A raffle at the event raised more than £500, which was split between suicide prevention charity Papyrus and a student project.
Dave Iveson (Level 2 Agriculture Programme Leader) said: “Many students had never put a halter on a calf before and to see them so confident in handling these livestock now is extremely rewarding. They should be very proud of themselves.”
Sunday provided several memorable NFL games, but few scenes like the one in Buffalo, with Bills and Colts players slugging their way through piles and piles of snow in a 13-7 overtime win for the home team.
A lake-effect system dumped up to eight inches of snow on the New Era Field on Sunday, with the storm never relenting.
"We kept saying it was like we were on a beach [in the sand]," receiver Deonte Thompson said, via ESPN's Mike Rodak. "The snow was so high so every time we stepped in it we would sink so it was tough to run a route.
"This is going to be something I tell my grandkids about. ... It was a crazy day today."
Epic photo evidence of Thompson's point from photographer Bill Wippert:
While both teams mostly eschewed the pass in the snowy conditions, Thompson's 34-yard haul on 3rd-and-9 with two minutes left in overtime set up the Bills' game-winning touchdown jaunt from LeSean McCoy.
"That was crazy man!" Kelvin Benjamin said of Thompson's catch. "That boy was blazing in the snow! Caught them with a jet ski, it was like they were on a jet ski man! I've never seen anybody run that fast in the snow, that was crazy!"
The swirling flurries induced a run-heavy game. The 97 combined rushing attempts between the two teams were the most in a game since Week 10, 1981 when the Chiefs and Bears tallied 100 attempts, per NFL Research.
It was not McCoy's first time playing in a snowstorm. The running back's career-high 217-yard rushing day came in 2013 with the Philadelphia Eagles in a whiteout win over the Detroit Lions. McCoy had 156 yards rushing Sunday, including the game-winner. The back said this storm was harder to deal with than the 2013 version.
"This game was a lot harder than the Philadelphia game," they said. "I think the biggest reason for that was that the snow never stopped and the wind never stopped. In the first half of the Philly game, it was crazy, but it stopped at halftime. We could run the ball a lot better. Where in this game, it continued to snow and snow and snow.
"I think this is probably the best [snow game], or the worst one."
Virginia - A US district judge in Virginia has ruled that President Donald Trump's executive order barring entry from seven countries is unconstitutional.
Judge Leonie Brinkema issued a preliminary injunction, asserting that the campaign vow to institute a "Muslim ban" violated the First Amendment, BBC reported Tuesday. The ruling is significant, as the judge ruled that religious bias is at the heart of Mr Trump's ban.
Another US judge has already upheld an order stopping implementation. The First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing laws that favour one religion over another.
Earlier this month a judge in California upheld a lower court's decision to bar the federal government from beginning implementation of the ban, which temporarily prohibits travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely suspends the refugee admissions programme.
In their 22-page ruling, the Virginia judge cited several of Mr Trump's campaign statements including those in which they promised to create a "Muslim ban" if they were elected president.
"The president themselves acknowledged the conceptual link between a Muslim ban and the EO (executive order)," Judge Brinkema wrote. They also criticised the president's statements that persecuted Christians may be permitted entry despite the ban, which they said amounts to a religious test.
They also referenced a Fox News interview in which former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Trump adviser, said that the president wants a "Muslim ban" and that they had been instructed by Mr Trump to put together a commission to determine "the right way to do it legally".
Judge Brinkema sharply criticised lawyers for the justice department, who they said did not present any evidence except for the president's executive order.
"Maximum power does not mean absolute power," they wrote. "Every presidential action must still comply with the limits set" by the separation of powers laid out in the US Constitution.
Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, who argued the case against the ban, praised the judge's decision saying "the overwhelming evidence shows that this ban was conceived in religious bigotry".
The temporary injunction applies only to residents of Virginia and faculties of state universities who may have been affected by the new travel restrictions.
The case was brought to the court in Alexandria, Virginia, on behalf of two Yemeni brothers who were turned away from the US shortly after arriving at Dulles International Airport.
The Yemeni men have since been allowed to enter the United States.
Mr Trump has said that they are considering rewriting the executive order, rather than bring the case to the Supreme Court.
AFP adds: The Trump administration appears to have dropped plans for an immediate appeal to defend the president's travel ban before the Supreme Court.
A Justice Department filing Monday indicated that it would continue to defend President Donald Trump's executive order in a federal appeals court that refused to reinstate it last week.
The appellate court decision was handed down by a three-judge panel, after a federal judge froze the ban.
The brief, signed by Justice Department attorney Michelle Bennett, did not mention any possible appeal before the Supreme Court, suggesting that the Trump administration may have concluded it would have poor chances of success after two successive court defeats.
The highest court in the land has been shorthanded, and deadlocked in a 4-4 split between liberals and conservatives for a year.
Trump has nominated a Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat left vacant after the death of conservative stalwart Antonin Scalia, but no Senate vote has yet been set for their confirmation.
US District Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order on February 3 blocking key provisions of Trump's travel restrictions, a decision upheld Thursday by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
The order temporarily barred people from seven Muslim-majority countries from traveling to the United States for 90 days, as well as all refugees for 120 days - except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely.
Bennett asked Robart to "postpone any further proceedings" in their district court pending a decision by the appeals court on whether to rehear the case. But Robart, ruling from the bench, denied the request for a delay. "I'm not prepared to slow this down," Robart said, according to CNN.
So the challenge to the ban - filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota - will go before the judge.
The states had urged the judge to expedite the process for the parties to exchange information, citing "the gravity of the states' constitutional allegations, defendants' stated national security concerns and the public interests at stake."
In the appellate court, an unidentified judge has requested that both parties submit briefs by Thursday on whether the three-judge panel's ruling should be reconsidered by a larger set of judges.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' "en banc" panels typically consist of 11 judges.
The Trump administration asked that Robart take no action over the lawsuit brought by the states of Washington and Minnesota while the San Francisco court decides whether a larger set of judges will reconsider Thursday's decision a panel of three judges who turned down the government's request to reinstate the president's travel ban.
Trump, who took the unusual step of publicly denouncing the appellate court's decision as "political," vowed last week to take the fight all the way to the Supreme Court, claiming in an all-caps tweet that "THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!"
And their administration had hinted it may unveil new measures on immigration in the wake of its court defeats. But the young presidential administration may have decided to change the course faced with a dearth of options.
Pursuing a legal battle in Robart's court is risky, in light of the judge's intent to block the entire order, while the rather progressive appeals court in San Francisco rebuffed the administration's arguments.
And a Supreme Court tie would keep the appellate court ruling intact.
New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday moved an appeal in the Delhi High Court challenging a special court order acquitting former telecom minister A Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the 2G spectrum money laundering scam.
The appeal against the 21 December judgment is based on several grounds, both factual and legal, an official said.
The ED, which is probing financial irregularities in the case and assisting the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), questioned the special court's verdict ignoring the findings of the Supreme Court that had been keeping a regular tab on the investigation until the chargesheet was filed in the case.
As per the agency, the offence of money laundering as defined under Section 3 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) is, among others, based on the term proceeds of crime which the special court failed to appreciate.
The court also failed to consider the point in which the crime is defined under Section 2(1)(u), which considers only the criminal activity instead of commission of an offence, the ED said, adding the acquittal by the court in PMLA prosecution by interpreting the term criminal activity to the extent of commission of an offence appeared to be "erroneous".
While announcing the judgment, special judge OP Saini had said the CBI and the ED had failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the charges against 33 persons named in the case. The matter is believed to have contributed to the Congress-led UPA's electoral loss in 2014.
Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted 17 others, including DMK supremo M. Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka of STPL, Asif Balwa and Rajiv Aggarwal of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd, film producer Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Sharad Kumar, Director of Kalaignar TV.
Former Telecom Secretary Siddharth Behura, Raja's erstwhile private secretary RK Chandolia, Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka, Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG)—Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair were also acquitted in the case by the special court.
The ED, in its chargesheet, had alleged that Rs 2 billion was paid by Swan Telecom (P) Ltd (STPL) promoters to DMK-run Kalaignar TV.
The CBI had alleged that there was a loss of Rs 309.84 billion to the exchequer in allocation of licences for the 2G spectrum, which were scrapped by the top court on 2 February, 2012.
The special court, which was set up on 14 March, 2011 to exclusively hear 2G cases had also acquitted Essar Group promoters Ravi Kant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia and six others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe.
The first case, prosecuted by the CBI, had 17 accused, while the second matter, pursued by the ED, had 19 undertrials. The third one had eight accused, including the Essar promoters.
Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman had a real bounce in their step as they bopped around the spring-training clubhouse on Tuesday. It's the kind of bounce you get when your salary gets a major bounce.
Stroman, 25, won their arbitration case with the Jays and was awarded $3.4 million for this season, an increase from $525,900 in 2016. The Jays had offered $3.1 million. The decision was announced Tuesday following a hearing on Friday before arbitrators Steven Wolf, Jeanne Wood, James Oldham.
Stroman took to Twitter not long after the ruling was released. They said they were “excited” to win the case and “really enjoyed the process.”
They also gave a shout-out to the Jays for “being extremely professional throughout the entire process.”
“Now ... time to get back to work and deliver the fans of TORONTO the World Series they deserve,” they tweeted.
Later they updated that: “Meant to say ... bring CANADA the World Series they deserve. Sorry! Lol”
The 25-year-old right-hander was 9-10 with a 4.37 ERA last year in their first full season following a torn left anterior cruciate ligament.
Excited to win my case. Really enjoyed the process. Shout to my family @us_tla for always having my back. Always stay true to my day ones! — Marcus Stroman (@MStrooo6) February 14, 2017
Shout to the @BlueJays for being extremely professional throughout the entire process as well! — Marcus Stroman (@MStrooo6) February 14, 2017
CALGARY – Shares in Enbridge Inc. closed down more than five per cent on Tuesday, the day after a judge in Minnesota recommended that its Line 3 pipeline replacement project follow the existing route across the state rather than the company's preferred route.
Enbridge traded as low as $37.53 before ending the day at $37.68, down $2.14, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

The administrative law judge's report could mean delays for the project if the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission adopts their recommendation, analysts at Desjardins Capital Markets said in a report. A vote is expected in June.
Desjardins said utilizing the existing route would mean physically removing the old pipe and replacing it, a process that would require Enbridge to stop oil shipments for about 16 months, effectively removing 390,000 barrels per day of crude oil takeaway capacity.
The existing route crosses two Ojibwe Native American reservations where tribal governments have voiced opposition to replacing the line, setting up the potential for future disputes, Desjardins said.

Judge Ann O'Reilly wrote that Enbridge has established that the project is needed, but that the negative consequences to Minnesota of the company's more southerly preferred route outweigh the benefits. The cost-benefit analysis shifts in favour of approving the project if Enbridge builds the pipeline in Line 3's existing trench, they said.
O'Reilly's recommendations aren't binding on the commission, but they're the product of an extensive public hearing and comment process.
Commission Chair Nancy Lange acknowledged at a hearing last month that whatever the commission decides, the dispute is likely to end up in court.
Enbridge said in a statement that it was pleased the judge listened to the extensive evidence for the need for the project, and will be taking time to review the recommendation that it use the existing right-of-way.
City of Spruce Grove council received a detailed update on the progress of their City Centre Area Redevelopment Plan (ARP).
Representatives from Cushing Terrill Architecture (CTA) presented the update during the April 16 council meeting.
The ARP was recommended in the City Centre Revitalization Discussion Paper in June 2014 and was subsequently approved by council as part of the 2017-19 corporate plan.
Currently, CTA has completed infrastructure assessment on the city centre, and a mapping session dealing with concerns around Columbus Park. According to the project principal in charge Wayne Freeman, the time has definitely come to start revitalizing the area.
“We've got ageing pipes underground and systems that are not functional for expanded residential development in the core area. We look at this because we need to be sure there's going to be available for infrastructure. This serves as a catalyst to private development,” said Freeman.
As part of the assessment, CTA recommended a replacement schedule, and gave a review of the city's existing traffic patterns and streetlights.
Transitioning into transportation, the organization explained they're currently undertaking a parking study to assess utilization. They also reviewed a plan to instil angle parking on MacLeod Ave. and the possibility of implementing one-year pilot projects to evaluate their success in alleviating traffic.
“In order to create a safer operating condition we did a transportation study. There's one area we're looking at closing, which is the entrance to Hwy. 16A
CTA also expressed major concern with the water distribution plant, recommending the City undergoes upgrades. With the distribution centre included, CTA recommended a total of $3.3 million dollars in work to the city's current system. Crews would also replace storm drainage, should the plan reach the approval stage.
“We're suggesting all of the piping should be replaced in the water distribution system. The pipe systems that are not PVC are actually asbestos cement. While that works, it does need to be replaced. With existing systems, they don't have the capacity,” explained Freeman.
The second part of the presentation went over key action considerations over the next 5-15 years, and included a map identifying how each would effect zoning. Many of the recommendations were centred around traffic reduction, with CTA looking to install additional four way stops and medians at various locations.
Under the presented ARP, Columbus Park would undergo renovations. CTA also hopes to implement a crime prevention policy, with the introduction of the for Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) program.
Council accepted the report as information, and will continue to review the process. The next step for CTA will be to take council's feedback and revisions, before turning their attention to some of their key considerations. Afterwards, they'll return to the city with a final report.
“Without an ARP, it is unlikely that much will change in the city centre. The existing Municipal Development Plan and land use bylaw create a regulatory framework that often makes it difficult to develop viable projects in the city centre area,” explained Dave Walker, manager of economic business and development with the city of Spruce Grove.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has bold plans for self-driving cars in 2017, and their company took a step towards that goal after it began rolling out a much-anticipated Autopilot update to owners of its newer vehicles.
Unlike older Teslas, vehicles built after October — known as hardware 2, “HW2” — were released initially without the full suite of Autopilot features, which provide advanced semi-autonomous driving for use on highway. That's because they shipped with different (new) software and hardware which, in the long run, will enable them to be fully self-driving. In the short term, though, this new update, announced by Musk on Twitter on New Year's Eve, will add a number of a number Autopilot features to the vehicles to get them near on par with older Tesla models.
But, there's a catch, and the update is only live an initial 1,000 cars. Most owners will need to wait for a wider rollout that Musk said is due within a week.
HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 31, 2016
Musk didn't go into details of the update, but Electrek reported that the release notes include Autopilot's Traffic Aware Cruise Control feature, Forward Collision Warning, and Autosteer, although the latter is only enabled at “low-speed.”
Owners of newer the Model S and Model X have had to wait a little, but there's huge upside to that since their vehicles come with all the sensors and computing power onboard needed to achieve full self-driving once the software is ready. That explains the delay of these Autopilot features too — it's actually different from the original Autopilot system, and takes advantage of the new on-board computer vision capabilities made possible by the upgraded sensor and computer hardware.
Musk has said that they believe Tesla will be in a position to field test full autonomy by the end of 2017. What we've seen of Tesla's tests have looked impressive so far, and the newer cars will sit near the front of the queue as that technology matures and becomes available to drivers on the road.
But it has been a challenging 2016 for Tesla. An owner died in an accident in May whilst using the Autopilot feature. The company said the “tragic loss” of Tesla owner Joshua D. Brown was down to “extremely rare circumstances.” Following the incident, Tesla split with self-driving tech partner Mobileye and the new imaging system in HW2 was developed by Tesla itself.
We did see the safety features offered by Autopilot make a positive difference in real-world conditions last year. A video of a Tesla owner in the Netherlands avoiding a seemingly-inevitable pile-up thanks to their Forward Collision Warning system went viral last week, while another recent clip showed a Model S P85D using instant acceleration to escape a likely crash.

The Big Sick will then expand wide July 14, alongside the bows of STX's Bad Moms spinoff Bad Dads, Open Road's romance Midnight Sun, Fox's follow-up War for the Planet of the Apes and Fox Searchlight's romance My Cousin Rachel.
The comedy is based on the real-life romance of writer Emily V. Gordon (The Carmichael Show) and Pakistan-born comedian Nanjiani, who wrote the script together. While navigating the clashing of their cultures, the couple also endured a life-changing twist when Emily contracted a mysterious illness.
Zoe Kazan portrays Emily in the film, which also features Holly Hunter, Ray Romano, Anupam Kher, Bo Burnham and Aidy Bryant. Michael Showalter directed the project, which was produced by Judd Apatow and Barry Mendel.
Following a heated bidding war, Amazon nabbed U.S. rights to The Big Sick for $12 million at Sundance. The mammoth deal included a few key territories as well.
Karachi: Forty-seven Indian fishermen have been arrested by Pakistani authorities for allegedly fishing in the country's territorial waters in the Arabian Sea, according to a maritime official.
The Pakistan Maritime Security Agency (PMSA) on Saturday arrested 47 Indian fishermen and seized nine launches for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters, a PMSA spokesperson was quoted as saying by the Express Tribune.
The arrested fishermen were handed over to the Docks police for further proceedings and investigation, it said.
The Indian boats have been confiscated for violating Pakistan's coastal territory, the spokesperson said, adding that said PMSA vessels and fast attack boats took part in an open sea operation for the purpose.
On 19 January, as many as 17 Indian fishermen had been arrested by the PSMA for allegedly fishing in Pakistan's territorial waters. Three boats had also been impounded.
Pakistan had released 292 Indian fishermen as a goodwill gesture in December-January.
Pakistan and India frequently arrest fishermen as there is no clear demarcation of the maritime border in the Arabian Sea and these fishermen do not have boats equipped with the technology to know their precise location.
A number of non-governmental organisations in both India and Pakistan have raised the issue, pressing their governments to release the arrested fishermen without delay.

LONDON Planning documents detailing the refurbishment of a residential tower block in West London where at least 12 people died in a fire on Wednesday did not refer to a type of fire barrier that building safety experts said should be used when high rise blocks are being re-clad.The local authority which owns Grenfell Tower in Kensington declined to confirm whether fire barriers were installed on most floors between the insulation panels attached to the exterior of the building as part of the renovation.Rydon Group, the construction company which undertook the work, also declined to say whether they had been used, but said the revamp "met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards.""We are shocked to hear of the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower and our immediate thoughts are with those that have been affected by the incident," a Rydon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.The government department in charge of regulating building work - the Department for Communities and Local Government - did not respond to Reuters' questions, including whether such fire barriers were required by law.It later issued a statement saying "it would not be appropriate to comment on the cause of the fire."Legal experts declined to express an opinion on whether fire barriers are required by law.A 2012 planning document published by The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, which included detailed diagrams of the planned new panelling and the materials used in the new skin, did not include reference to the barriers, according to a Reuters review.
The only new cladding elements depicted or listed in the "Sustainability and Energy Statement" were wall fixings, exterior zinc panels and polyisocyanurate insulation panels.It is not clear if the document represented the final design used in the refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey 1970s apartment block home to hundreds of residents, or whether fire barriers recommended by industry bodies were installed.Save for a few of the lower floors, Grenfell Tower was engulfed in flames, trapping families in the upper storeys.Witnesses said the flames spread quickly up the building as most residents slept, and photographs later on Wednesday showed an almost entirely blackened, smouldering shell.
The 8.7 million pound ($11.08 million) refurbishment was completed last year. It involved the application of new external cladding and replacement windows, with the aim of improving heat and noise insulation, according to council documents.The application of insulating layers to the outside of buildings is common, but it is also recognised by some architects and construction safety specialists as a potential fire risk.That is because the area between the new exterior panel and the existing wall – which is usually filled with insulating material – becomes a potential channel for flames to rise up along the sides of the building, safety experts said.The London Fire Brigade said it did not yet know the cause of the fire.
"We have heard a number of theories about the cause of the fire at Grenfell Tower," said the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the local authority which owns the block."All of these will be thoroughly investigated as part of the formal investigation which has already begun," it said in a statement.Documents published by the Building Research Establishment (BRE) and industry body the Insulated Render and Cladding Association recommend that fire-proof barriers be installed at each floor to make it harder for flame to travel up the gap in between the new and old skins."There is potential for the fire to propagate throughout the system if adequate fire barriers are not installed ... the installation of fire barriers at each floor level above the first floor level (i.e. starting with the second storey) should be considered," the BRE said in a publication entitled "Fire performance of external thermal insulation for walls of multi-storey buildings".Reuters was not able to determine how widely or how closely these guidelines were followed in similar renovations, and it was not clear what impact the guidelines would have had in the case of Grenfell Tower.The BRE is an organisation that provides safety guidelines for the construction industry, and, although it does not have regulatory powers, it is widely considered as the setter of the best industry standards.(For a graphic on London tower block fire, click tmsnrt.rs/2riqUpr) (Editing by Mike Collett-White)

Arthur McCann's tribute to veterans takes up most of the front lawn of their Norwood, Massachusetts, home.
It's a giant American flag, spray-painted using field paint. And it will stay there for several months before the paint grows out, they told USA TODAY.
“I just like to go big," they said. They estimate the flag measures roughly 30 by 20 feet.
McCann, who runs a maintenance department, said it took them about two hours to create the tribute.
McCann said their grandfather served in the Navy in World War II. The flag is an artistic tribute to those who served, they said.
This is the second time he's painted the flag before an annual Fourth of July party at their house. They said locals drive by to see the flag.
It's a patriotic community, they said. There are lots of flags displayed in their neighborhood. There also are a large number of veterans who live in the area, located southwest of Boston.
They hope no one takes the flag the wrong way. It's not a political statement to them — it's a patriotic one: “I really do this for a positive message,” they said.
Opinion: July Fourth is a celebration of the founding freedoms we need to teach in our schools
Later on Wednesday, McCann plans to welcome about 75 people into their home for a Fourth of July party.
They'll eat chicken, burgers, mac and cheese, corn bread, sausages, and more.
“I just love America and the freedom and opportunities it gives and I love to be creative,” McCann told WBZ-TV.

A monkey that took a selfie using a wildlife photographer's camera cannot sue for copyright, a US court has ruled.
Naruto, a seven-year-old crested macaque, snapped a picture of themselves using a camera belonging to Brit David Slater.
Animal rights group, PETA, filed a lawsuit in 2015 that sought to give the monkey copyright over the selfie.
Now the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled against Naruto and PETA after concluding American copyright law does not “expressly authorise animals to file copyright infringement suits”.
(Image: Rex Features)
“We must determine whether a monkey may sue humans, corporations, and companies for damages and injunctive relief arising from claims of copyright infringement,” Judge Carlos Bea wrote.
“We conclude that this monkey - and all animals since they are not human - lacks statutory standing under the Copyright Act.”
The picture was taken when Slater set up a camera in an Indonesian forest,
(Image: David Slater/Caters News Agency)
and Naruto somehow tripped the camera themselves while the photographer was not at the scene.
PETA had sued the Brit when they sold some of the photos in 2015.
They argued that Naruto owned the rights to the photos, calling the images “original works of authorship.”
The group's initial lawsuit was dismissed on the grounds a monkey lacks standing to sue over copyright.
(Image: PETA)
But PETA appealed, arguing the US Copyright Act doesn't specify that a work's author must be human.
Both sides eventually settled, with Slater agreeing to donate 25 percent of future income from the Naruto photos to protect habitats where crested macaques live.
But the 9th Circuit still decided to rule in the important case.
In the ruling, the court appeared to take a swipe at PETA saying in a footnote the group “seems to employ Naruto as an unwitting pawn in its ideological goals.”
PETA's general counsel, Jeff Kerr, said in a statement the monkey had been discriminated against “simply because he's a nonhuman animal.”
Slater, of Chepstow, south Wales, said they welcomed the decision, adding the lawsuit has taken an emotional and financial toll on him.
The income that they receive from the selfie is “embarrassingly low”, they added.

If you're forever scrolling Instagram in search of a new brow muse, it's time you called off the search because we've found it in brow wizard Kristie Streicher who counts the likes of Adele and Gwenyth Paltrow as fans of their amazing 'micro feathering' technique. Microblading may have finally met its match...
Who could have predicted those nights spent in front of the bathroom mirror plucking every eyebrow hair from our faces during the noughties would later lead to years of regret and despair at the thin lines that now lie in their place?
Because while the array of products available to us, including powders, waxes and pencils to name a few, do give what remains of our brows some much-needed plumping, such solutions are only temporary and not to mention time consuming.
No wonder then, kids of the nineties went loco for microblading when it burst into the beauty realm: a hair-mimicking treatment that completely changed the brow game, promising us the natural looking semi-permanent, bolder brows we've always dreamed of, and more importantly, transforming our idea of previously shudder worthy 'eyebrow tattoos' forever.
But while microblading is understandably just as popular today, like the greedy lot we are, we still want MORE. Specifically speaking: thinner strokes, longer-lasting pigment and an even more natural look which is exactly what new kid on the brow blading block 'microfeathering' can provide, apparently.
What on earth is 'microfeathering'?
At the helm of the new treatment is eyebrow guru to the stars Kristie Streicher whose needling technique is taking LA by storm. She's already got their hands on some of the hottest A-listers' brows in the game including Adele, Gwyneth Paltrow, Mandy Moore and Lorde.

As the phrase 'feathering' suggests, microfeathering involves a lighter, less-defined application technique than microblading - think fluffy, natural-looking brows, rather than the clean, sharp Instagram arch we're used to. The result is so subtle that it's difficult to tell if the brows have been bladed at all and that's certainly a plus if you're looking to boost your brows without the tell tale signs of fading ink.
Speaking to Refinery9, Kristie explained: "I love brows that are wild and sprout-y in the front, and a little bit longer on the ends — they just look beautiful, I've always likened it to lashes; the more lashes you have, and the more brow hair you have, the more healthy, young, and refreshed you look."
"I just add little, tiny hair strokes, just a few, and it really makes such a difference," they say. "I see a lot of tattoo artists using the same template and brow outline for everyone, which often ends up looking very artificial, but with microfeathering, you're left with a full-looking brow, rather than a microbladed brow."

New Delhi: The Congress has dismissed that Sonia Gandhi was choosing Priyanka Gandhi as working president . .
Priyanka's personal assistant P Sahay has termed this speculation as “complete fabrication”. According to Sahay, there was no such discussion in this regard at all.
It is worthwhile pointing out there was buzz in the media after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting on August 8 that Sonia Gandhi broached the possibility of Priyanka as working president of the party with senior leaders.
While there have been demands within the party circle that Priyanka Gandhi should be given some responsibility in the Congress, Priyanka has restricted themselves mainly to Amethi and Rae Barelli.
Sonia said in CWC meeting that a young face is the order of the day if party want to do well in 2019.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Wednesday denied media reports that a deal had been reached between the United States and Turkey on a three-step plan for withdrawing the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia from Syria's Manbij.
"We don't have any agreements yet with the government of Turkey," department spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement in Washington.
"We're continuing to have ongoing conversations regarding Syria and other issues of mutual concern," they said, adding that American and Turkish officials had met in Ankara last week for talks on the issue.
Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said on Wednesday Ankara and Washington had reached a technical agreement on the withdrawal plan, a move Turkey has long sought from the United States.
The report comes as differences over Syria policy and Washington's decision in December to move its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem have strained ties between the NATO allies.
Turkey is outraged by U.S. support for the YPG militia, considering them a terrorist organisation. Ankara has threatened to push its offensive in northern Syria's Afrin region further east to Manbij.
Manbij is a potential flashpoint. The Syrian government, Kurdish militants, Syrian rebel groups, Turkey, and the United States all have a military presence in northern Syria.
Under the terms of the plan to be finalised during a visit by Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu to Washington on June 4, the YPG will withdraw from Manbij 30 days after the deal is signed, Anadolu said, quoting sources who attended meetings at which the decisions were made.
Turkish and U.S. military forces will start joint supervision in Manbij 45 days after the agreement is signed and a local administration will be formed 60 days after June 4, Anadolu said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Cavusoglu told broadcaster AHaber that a timetable for the Manbij plans could be set during talks with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington, and that it could be implemented before the end of the summer.
Cavusoglu was also quoted by media on their return flight from Germany saying that, if finalised, the plan for Manbij could be applied throughout northern Syria.
However, a local Manbij official later told Reuters that Cavusoglu's assertions that U.S. and Turkish forces would temporarily control the region were "premature" and lacked credibility.
Relations between Ankara and Washington have hit a low-point due to factors such as the sentencing this month in New York of a former Turkish state bank executive to 32 months in prison for taking part in an Iran sanctions-busting scheme, a case Turkey has called a political attack.
DEFENCE PROCUREMENT
Turkey has also caused unease in Washington with its decision to buy S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia and drew criticism over its detention of a U.S. Christian pastor, Andrew Brunson, on terrorism charges.
Brunson faces up to 35 years in prison on charges of links to the network Ankara blames for a 2016 coup attempt. The pastor denied the charges in a Turkish court this month.
A U.S. Senate committee last week passed its version of a $716 billion defence policy bill, including a measure to prevent Turkey from buying Lockheed Martin F-35 jets, citing Brunson and the Russian missile deal.
Cavusoglu, however, said that if the United States blocked Turkey from buying the jets, Ankara would go elsewhere to meet its needs, adding that it was unlikely Washington would be able to back out of the deal.
Turkey has plans to buy more than 100 of the F-35 jets and the Pentagon last year awarded Lockheed $3.7 billion in an interim payment for the production of 50 of the aircraft earmarked for non-U.S. customers, including Ankara.

Targhetta & Wooldridge Funeral Home in Brighton is in charge of arrangements.
When commanding officer Major Adam Jowett faced the battle of a lifetime against a deadly force of Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan in the summer of 2006, it was the culmination of an ambition that was born 24 years earlier.
The Surrey schoolboy was just 11 years old when they saw television images of the ‘grimy, hard-looking men' in maroon berets, the famous Paras who fought and won a tough campaign in the faraway Falkland Islands, and vowed that one day they would be a soldier and lead their own men into battle.
And when they stepped into the fray in Helmand province at the head of a hastily assembled and under-strength unit of Paras and Royal Irish rangers, Jowett was finally commanding a troop of their own… but against a ferocious, merciless enemy in one of the toughest places on Earth.
The man who had so relished the physical and mental challenges of officer training at Sandhurst College was about to face their sternest and most terrifying test yet in the notorious siege at Musa Qala, a town and district centre in the central western part of Helmand which would become the scene of a heroic struggle.
Twelve years after the heart-thumping events in that summer of 2006, Jowett brings us their raw, honest, hard-hitting, emotional and truly inspirational account of a fight for survival that has been labelled by former war reporter Martin Bell as ‘the Rorke's Drift of our times.'
Describing in visceral and vivid detail what it was like to have responsibility for the lives of their men as they fought back bravely over 21 days and nights of relentless, nerve-shredding combat, Jowett takes us up close and personal to the heart of war – from the crumps, whumps and booms of attack to the sickening sight of a man down and the sheer exhaustion of almost non-stop fighting.
In charge of a new unit, which took the letter E and soon became known as ‘Easy Company,' Jowett's mission had been to hold the district centre at any cost but their base was a ramshackle compound and their defences were weak.
Cut off, outgunned and heavily outnumbered by the Taliban in the town, the British soldiers were a sitting target for their enemy who began launching wave after wave of brutal attacks, including crawling up the compound walls and having to be driven back with hand grenades.
Finally, as they came down to their last rounds and with 80 men left to face 500 of the enemy, death seemed to stare Easy Company in the face. The battlegroup did not have the resources to bring in more ammunition by convoy and the danger of flying in Chinook helicopters made that method of resupply too risky.
‘The statistics weren't great on paper,' writes Jowett, ‘but they didn't take into account that my small number of British soldiers were amongst the best trained infantry in the world, and that they would fight like dogs.'
The night before what many knew could be their last day, Jowett like every other man in the company, marked out their last magazine. ‘When I was down to my last few rounds, I would make sure I died upright and fighting. Better that than the alternative of falling into the hands of the Taliban, which was far worse than death.
‘Tomorrow, our enemy would come and try to kill us, and it was my job – my duty – to see they died instead.'
Surrounded by the enemy and with their backs to the wall and no way out, no one in Easy Company could have foreseen that the siege was destined to take an extraordinary turn…
Gripping, emotionally charged and intensely powerful, No Way Out is a dramatic and yet straightforwardly honest first-hand account of war in all its grim reality; but it is also Jowett's moving tribute to the gallant men of their unit.
Some were injured and some did not come home alive but it was ‘their courage, their grit, and their sheer unbreakable spirit' which defied the greatest odds to beat back ‘an unrelentingly barbaric enemy' and which will forever be a part of the man who led them.

These are busy times for auto mechanics across Quebec.
They're racing to get as many snow tires installed on as many cars as possible before the Dec. 15 deadline.
Workers at Garage Donati & Massa in Longueuil are spending most of their waking hours putting on the winter treads.
READ MORE: Winter tires are the fastest growing tire category in Canada: Report
“A lot of people are just walking up and asking us if we have room today. They're our customers so we will take them,” Justin Massa, the owner's son, told Global News.
The mandatory winter tire law came into effect in 1980. Offenders face fines between $200 and $300.
Many people are still waiting until the last-minute.
Garage owner John Massa says there is a combination of factors at play to explain why so many waits until near the deadline.
“It could be money related. It could be security, they want to wait. ‘It's still dry, it's still warm we got time', but as soon as that little snowfall comes in they react, they start going crazy,” Massa told Global News.

And the SAAQ reports that 27 per cent of all winter accidents last season resulted in death.
CAA-Quebec says the best time to install tires is well before the temperature drops below 7 degrees.
“The rubber of the winter tire has been made to be more flexible than a summer tire. That's why we say to people at seven degrees Celsius it's time to put your winter tire on,” Annie Gauthier told Global News.
With a significant amount of snow on the way for greater Montreal, the best bet is to get the winter tires installed as soon as possible.
BERLIN—Partnering on an anticipated title from a distinguished Latin American woman director which offers an original take on Latin-America-U.S. emigration, Sandro Fiorin's Miami-based FiGa Films has boarded Julia Solomonoff's upcoming “Nobody's Watching.”
One of the foremost sales companies of Latin American films, FiGa Films will handle international sales on this singular Latin American/U.S production.
Largely set in New York, and spoken in English and Spanish, “Nobody's Watching” marks Solomonoff's follow-up to “Sisters,” backed by Walter Salles, and “The Summer of la Boyita,” co-produced by Pedro and Agustin Almodovar's El Deseo. Solomonoff produced Julia Murat's “Pendular,” which plays in this year's Berlinale Panorama section.
“A film about immigration but not about a man searching for a green card,” in Solomonoff words, “Nobody's Watching” stars Argentine actor Guillermo Pfening (“The German Doctor,” “Boyita”). Pfening plays Nico, an attractive Argentinean and famous actor back in Argentina who lives in New York and works as a part-time servant, house-keep and male nanny. They become unexpectedly attached to baby Theo, who will stir in them a new tenderness and a search for home, the film's synopsis runs.
But Nico's world is shaken by the unexpected arrival of Martin, their former producer and lover, forcing them to confront the true reasons for their running away.
“The film examines an immigrant experience that doesn't often land on the screen: the unexpected gains that ‘failure' can provide and the realization that actual success lies in the journey of self-discovery,” Solomonoff commented, adding that “Nobody's Watching” has “a very particular identity – It's Latino and it's a American indie, with a gay protagonist and directed by a woman… New York-specific (but no postcards here).”
A project which has attracted the enthusiasm of prominent – and often women – producers in Latin America and beyond, “Nobody's Watching” is produced by Felicitas Raffo and Andres Longares at Cepa Audiovisual, as well as Natalia Agudelo Campillo and Nicolas Herreno Leal for Colombia's MadLove, and Lucia Murat at Taiga Filmes e Video in Brazil. Aleph Motion Pictures' Jaime Mateus Tique and LA Panda Productions' Elisa Lleiras produce out of the U.S.
Co-production partners include Isabel Coixet's Miss Wasabi in Barcelona, Juan Perdomo at the Dominican Republic's Perdomo Productions, Georges Schoucair at Shortcuts International in Lebanon and film producer-director Bogdan Apetri.
“It's a privilege to collaborate with such a strong team, often of very talented women,” said FiGa's Sandro Fiorin.
It has been observed through a recent survey by the WHO that over 20 million people in Pakistan smoke excessively, the majority of which is the youth population.
Even the portion of the public that's educated and aware of its effects indulge in the activity due to social norms and pressures.
Our government generates a considerable amount of its revenue, 200 billion per annum precisely, from tobacco companies in the form of sales tax and custom duties.
Despite the fact that the tobacco companies employ thousands of people and is one of the reasons for the developing of our economy, the cost for countering the adverse effects of smoking – like various forms of cancer, heart attacks and increased blood pressure – by building hospitals and importing medicines along equipment for the treatment of diseases takes away a significant portion of the budget available.
Not only that but it limits the working capacity of individuals thus leading to decreased levels of output and creating a deficit for many companies.
It is requested that strict and urgent steps be taken to curb the issue.
For example, smoking can be prohibited in public areas, sale of tobacco to minors banned or made a crime, checks on media for the glamorisation of the act of smoking, drastic increase in prices to discourage individuals from buying cigarettes and awareness campaigns can be held for the public.

The 55-year-old has been dismissed after just one season in charge of the Premier League club.
"Southampton Football Club can today confirm that it has terminated the contract of Claude Puel with immediate effect," a Saints statement released on Wednesday read.
"Everyone at Southampton would like to express our thanks to Claude for their hard work and commitment this year. The highlight of the season was a memorable day at Wembley in the EFL Cup Final, a day our fans will always treasure.
"We wish Claude well for the future.
"The search for a new management team is under way. We are confident that we will find the right fit in line with the long-term vision of the club."

Speculation had been mounting that Puel's time at St Mary's Stadium was drawing to a close following a significant dip in results in the latter half of the 2016-17 season.
Southampton won only four of their remaining 13 league games after they were beaten 3-2 by Manchester United in the EFL Cup final on February 26.
There have also been reports that Puel's relationship with senior players and officials at the club had deteriorated in recent months.
The former Monaco and Lyon boss, who succeeded Ronald Koeman in June 2016, has been linked with a return to Ligue 1 with Saint-Etienne.
Saints are reportedly interested in Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe as a possible replacement, along with ex-Borussia Dortmund head coach Thomas Tuchel.
Patna: Omission of RJD leader Tej Pratap Yadav's name from a list of dignitaries who would be attending the party's 22nd foundation day celebrations on Thursday, has added gist to speculations about a rift within party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav's family. However, a number of posters were put up at the party's state headquarters and the venue of the function, featuring all members of the family currently active in politics. The posters also included Tej Pratap's newly-wedded wife Aishwarya Rai, signalling their possible entry into public life.
Reacting to the omission of their name, the RJD chief's elder son rubbished speculations about rift within the family. What is so big about my name not featuring in a list of RJD leaders on the invitation card. My name and my photographs can be found on all the posters and banners put up by the party. I will also be taking part in the celebrations on Thursday. All this talk of family feud is a rumour spread by BJP people, they told reporters.
But, BJP and JD(U) seem to be in no mood to buy their defence and reiterated growing trouble within the RJD's first family. BJP state vice president Devesh Kumar told PTI there was trouble brewing within the Lalu family which controls the party. While we abhor dynasty politics, going by the Hindu tradition, Tej Pratap who is the elder son of the RJD supremo deserved to be the political heir. But that did not happen, they said. They had to remain content with a cabinet berth when their younger brother Tejashwi Yadav became the deputy chief minister. At present, Tej Pratap is just a party MLA while Tejashwi is the leader of the Opposition in the state Assembly, the BJP leader said.
Lalu also played favourites by getting Tejashwi declared as the party's chief ministerial candidate, leaving Tej Pratap with no choice but to play second fiddle, they alleged. So now, while the three children of Lalu, including the eldest daughter Misa Bharti, are active in politics, it is Tejashwi who is hogging the limelight. It is foolish to blame BJP for the rift in the family, which is all too obvious, the state BJP vice president added.
About Lalu's daughter-in-law Aishwarya's photograph on the posters, the BJP leader said it only proves that in the RJD, you have to be related to the Lalu family, in whatever way, in order to take centre stage. Tej Pratap had tied the knot with Aishwarya in May this year.
Echoing the BJP leader's views, JD(U) MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said Lalu Prasad has emerged as a neo-feudal force in modern politics. Indeed, there is a rift within the family and that is inevitable when the entire family enters politics and starts yearning for clout, they said.
As if this was not enough, now the RJD supremo's daughter-in-law of two months also seems to be ready to enter the political arena. Lalu may have worked hard to earn their own political stature, but they have degenerated into a patriarch who cannot look beyond their family, the JD(U) leader alleged. It would be for the first time that Lalu Prasad, who had floated the RJD after breaking away from the Janata Dal in 1997, would remain conspicuous by their absence at Thursday's function which would be inaugurated by Tejashwi Yadav.
Convicted in cases of multi-crore fodder scam, Prasad is presently on provisional bail on medical ground.  They are admitted at a Mumbai hospital. According to a statement issued by RJD state unit
spokesperson Chittaranjan Gagan, top leaders like national vice presidents Rabri Devi, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Shivanand Tiwary, state president Ram Chandra Purve, MPs, MLAs and office bearers at district and block levels will be attending the function.
A man in their 20s suffers serious injuries after a stabbing near Toronto's Regent Park.
Toronto paramedics said they got the call to Regent and Dundas streets around 7:20 p.m. Friday evening.
Police arrived shortly after and located a man suffering serious stab wounds.
The victim was rushed to a trauma centre via emergency run, with serious injuries that are considered potentially life threatening.
Toronto police have not released any suspect information.
WASHINGTON - More than 190 Democratic lawmakers sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Wednesday, saying they had accepted funds from foreign governments through their businesses without congressional consent in violation of the US Constitution.
The complaint said Trump had not sought congressional approval for any of the payments their hundreds of businesses had received from foreign governments since they took office in January, even though the Constitution requires them to do so. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment but has said Trump's business interests do not violate the Constitution. The Trump Organization has said it will donate profits from customers representing foreign governments to the US Treasury but will not require such customers to identify themselves.
At least 30 US senators and 166 representatives are plaintiffs in Wednesday's lawsuit, representing the largest number of legislators ever to sue a US president, according to two lawmakers who are among the plaintiffs.
The Constitution's "foreign emoluments" clause bars US officeholders from accepting payments and various other gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.
"The president's failure to tell us about these emoluments, to disclose the payments and benefits that they are receiving, mean that we cannot do our job. We cannot consent to what we don't know," said Senator Richard Blumenthal, one of the lawmakers bringing the lawsuit, in a conference call on Tuesday.
Representative John Conyers, another plaintiff, added: “President Trump has conflicts of interest in at least 25 countries, and it appears he's using their presidency to maximize their profits." The Justice Department declined to comment.
Similar lawsuits have been filed in recent months by parties including a nonprofit ethics group, a restaurant trade group, and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia.
They allege that Trump's acceptance of payments from foreign and US governments through their hospitality empire puts other hotel and restaurant owners at an unfair disadvantage and provides governments an incentive to give Trump-owned businesses special treatment.
In a motion to dismiss one such lawsuit on Friday, the Justice Department argued that the plaintiffs had not shown any specific harm to their businesses, and that Trump was only banned from receiving foreign government gifts if they arose from their service as president.
On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said "partisan politics" was behind the lawsuit by the Maryland and District of Columbia officials.
Lawmakers rarely sue the president, so there are few federal court decisions the legislators can cite to prove their legal standing to bring Wednesday's case, said Leah Litman, an assistant professor specializing in constitutional law at the University of California, Irvine.
"But the constitutional provision they're suing to enforce gives them a role in how it's carried out, and that gives them a powerful standing argument," Litman said.
The lawmakers in Wednesday's lawsuit will be represented in court by the Constitutional Accountability Center, a public interest law firm in Washington. Each lawmaker is paying a share of the legal fees from personal or campaign accounts.
Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has denounced as a "detestable lie" the idea they colluded with Russians meddling in the 2016 election, and they clashed with Democratic lawmakers over their refusal to detail their conversations with President Donald Trump.
Sessions, a senior member of Trump's Cabinet and an adviser to their election campaign last year, had a series of tense exchanges with Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee during about 2-1/2 hours of testimony as they pressed them to recount discussions with the Republican president.
"You raised your right hand here today and said you would solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth," Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich said. "Now you're not answering questions. You're impeding this investigation."
Sessions refused to say whether they and Trump discussed FBI Director James Comey's handling of an investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia during the election campaign before the president fired Comey on May 9.
They also declined to say if Trump opposed Sessions' decision to recuse themselves from the Russia probe in March, and whether Justice Department officials discussed possible presidential pardons of individuals being looked at in the probe.
Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told Sessions: "I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling. Americans don't want to hear that answers to relevant questions are privileged."
"I am not stonewalling," Sessions replied, saying they were simply following Justice Department policy not to discuss confidential communications with the president. Sessions' testimony did not provide any damaging new information on Trump campaign ties with Russia or on Comey's dismissal, but their refusal to discuss conversations with Trump raised fresh questions about whether the White House has something to hide.
Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a parallel Russia probe, said on Twitter that Congress "must compel responses using whatever process necessary."
Last week, Comey told the Senate committee that Trump had fired them to undermine the FBI's investigation of the Russia matter.
Trump's decision to fire Comey, a move recommended by Sessions despite having already recused themselves from the Russia probe, prompted critics to charge that the president was trying to interfere with a criminal investigation.
Senator Angus King, an independent, questioned Sessions' legal basis for refusing to answer questions after Sessions said Trump had not invoked executive privilege regarding the conversations.
Executive privilege can be claimed by a president or senior government officials to withhold information from Congress or the courts to protect the executive branch decision-making process.
Sessions said it would be "inappropriate" for them to reveal private conversations with Trump when the president "has not had a full opportunity to review the questions and to make a decision on whether or not to approve such an answer."
Legal experts said there was some merit to Sessions' argument.
Andrew Wright, a professor at Savannah Law School and associate counsel under former President Barack Obama, said it was not unusual for government employees to refuse to discuss conversations with the president in order to preserve the right to invoke executive privilege later.
Sessions' clash with the Democratic senators was the latest chapter in a saga that has dogged Trump in their first five months as president and distracted from their domestic policy agenda including major healthcare and tax cut initiatives.
"The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie," Sessions said.
"I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected with the Trump campaign."
US intelligence agencies concluded in a report released in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to interfere in the election to help Trump in part by hacking and releasing damaging emails about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Russia has denied any such interference, and Trump has denied any collusion by their campaign with Moscow.
Sessions recused themselves from the Russia investigation in March after revelations that they had failed to disclose two meetings last year with Russia's ambassador to Washington, Sergei Kislyak.
In their testimony on Tuesday, Sessions addressed media reports that they may have had a third previously undisclosed meeting with Kislyak at Washington's Mayflower Hotel last year.
Sessions said they did not have any private meetings and could not recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the hotel but did not rule out that a "brief interaction" with Kislyak may have occurred there.
A former Republican senator, Sessions was an early supporter of Trump's presidential campaign, but sources say there has been tension between the two men in recent weeks because Trump was annoyed that Sessions recused themselves from the Russia probe.
Sessions said on Tuesday they did not recuse themselves because they felt they were a subject of the investigation themselves but rather because they felt they were required to by Justice Department rules.
29-year-old man was sent to hospital with serious injuries
Peel Regional Police are looking for these three men in connection with a brutal assault on a man with autism on March 13. (Peel Regional Police)
Police in Ontario say they believe that at least one of three men who beat up a man with autism in the greater Toronto area could be from the Lower Mainland.
Peel Regional Police say the assault happened at the Square One bus terminal in Mississauga on March 13 at about 10:45 p.m.
The 29-year-old man was sitting at the bottom of the stairs of the terminal's lower level when three men approached.
The suspects surrounded them and “continued to punch and kick the male multiple times” before fleeing.
The man was taken to hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.
“We believe at least one might be from British Columbia,” said Const. Iryna Yashnyk. “We're hoping to get the video out there in case somebody might recognize them.”
WATCH: Police provide a video of the assault
Note: Footage may be disturbing to some viewers
The first suspect is described as a 5'10” South Asian man with a light complexion, short dark beard and short black hair cut. They were wearing a black T-shirt with a red Air Jordan logo and white Jordan lettering, with black track pants and black shoes.
The second suspect is described as a thin, clean shaven 5'10” South Asian man with a light complexion. They were wearing a black jacket with a grey horizontal stripe across the chest and a grey vertical stripe along the hood, black track pants and black shoes.
The third suspect is described as an unshaven 5'10” South Asian man with a medium complexion. They had a medium build and was wearing a black hoodie with a Nike logo and white Nike lettering along the sleeves, with black track pants and black shoes.
Anyone with any information is asked to call the 12 Division Criminal Investigation Bureau at 905-453-2121, ext. 1233, or if they wish to remain anonymous, to call Peel Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477, visit their website or text 27467 with the world ‘peel' and their tip.

South Lyon Council Holds Off On Deed Provision For Contaminated Site
December 11, 2017
South Lyon City Council members say they want more information before agreeing to begin the process of ending oversight of a piece of contaminated land.
The municipal parking lot at 128 S. Lafayette Street is owned by the city, but was contaminated over a five-year period in the late 80's and early 90's when an Amoco gas station stood on the property. It has since undergone extensive remediation paid for by BP North America, which merged with Amoco in 1998. BP is now seeking to add a restrictive covenant to the property deed, which would be the first step toward ending their oversight of the land, while also alerting future owners of the property about its history. BP says that while the site still has remnants of contamination, it is considered safe for non-residential use. The lot is also currently home to the South Lyon Farmer's Market.
BP's consultant says contamination levels have steadily been decreasing and any additional actions to accelerate that process are no longer feasible. It is offering to pay the city $15,000 to cover the costs of putting the covenant in place, including inspecting test wells the company wants to eventually close down. Several council members indicated they would like to see a better offer and tabled the issue until next month for further discussion. Picture courtesy of Google Street View. (JK)
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's sugar output is likely to jump 33 percent from a year ago to 27 million tonnes in 2017/18 marketing year, giving the world's second-biggest producer enough surplus for overseas sales, a senior industry official said on Friday.
India's sugar marketing year runs from October to September.
The south Asian country's consumption in 2017/18 is pegged around 25.75 million tonnes, Rahil Shaikh, managing director of ED&F Man India, said on the sidelines of a conference.
“Instead of next year, we'll have a large surplus this year itself, resulting in exports to suck that extra supply out of the country,” they said.

LAHORE/Islamabad - In what is being dubbed as another U-turn by the PTI, Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Mian Mehmoodur Rashid on Wednesday withdrew the name of their party's nominee Nasir Mehmood Khan Khosa for the office of caretaker Punjab chief minister.
This about-turn comes at the heels of another such decision made only a couple of days ago wherein the party had withdrawn the name of its nominee, Manzoor Afridi, for the slot of KP caretaker chief minister.
Mr Rashid announced yesterday that their party would propose new names for the caretaker slot in Punjab after holding intra-party consultation.
“We made a mistake by recommending Khosa's name in haste,” they said, while addressing a news conference here. They said the new name would be announced within 24 hours.
PTI chief Imran Khan also chaired an important meeting of party's central leadership on Wednesday in Islamabad, according to the PTI central media department.
The meeting withdrew the nomination of Nasir Khosa for caretaker Punjab chief minister slot, citing strong public reaction as the reason.
PTI central leadership also approved the names of Himayatullah and Ejaz Qureshi for the caretaker chief minister of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The meeting also condemned the ‘last-minute appointments' made in the centre and Punjab by the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government.
It formed committees to review and analyze the appointment of Advocate General Punjab as well as the 14 law officers, chief of Pemra, HEC, PIA, and CAA.
The party also criticised Ali Jahangir Siddiqui's appointment as Ambassador to the US.
The meeting condemned the Punjab government after audit reports allegedly exposed irregularities worth Rs166 billion in 56 companies, and vowed to bring the details before the nation.
U-turn on Punjab caretaker
The name of former Punjab chief secretary Nasir Khosa was announced as Punjab caretaker CM after a meeting between Rashid and Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday.
Shehbaz then took to twitter to announce that Nasir will be Punjab's caretaker chief minister and the decision had been taken unanimously after holding several rounds of talks with the opposition leader.
“Glad to announce that Leader of the Opposition in Punjab [Assembly] and I have agreed on the name of Nasir Saeed Khosa [sic] as caretaker Chief Minister Punjab for interim setup. Another step towards strengthening democratic process,” Shehbaz Sharif said in their tweet.
The explanation given by the party for withdrawal of the name is even more confusing than the decision itself.
Mr Rashid said the previous announcement was made in hast as there was some confusion and misunderstanding over the names of Tariq Masood Khosa and Nasir Mahmood Khosa.
Tariq and Nasir are brothers of senior Supreme Court judge Asif Saeed Khosa, and apparently because of their name the media is mentioning Tariq Masood Khosa and Nasir Mahmood Khosa as Tariq Saeed Khosa and Nasir Saeed Khosa.
Even Punjab chief minister wrote Nasir's name as Nasir Saeed Khosa in their Monday's tweet.
Opposition Leader Mahmoodur Rashid also called them Nasir Saeed Khosa in their media talk.
Interestingly, Rasheed shared that PTI chief Imran Khan had cleared the name of Nasir Khosa for the caretaker chief minister.
Then they went on to say that ever since their nomination, Nasir had become a controversial figure with a lot of criticism coming from different quarters on the social and public media.
PTI' Central Secretary Information Fawad Ch said that PTI had earlier given their name keeping in view their capability, administrative qualities and their track record.
They said Nasir Khosa was known as a competent officer but when their name was made public, there came a reaction [against him] from the social media and also from within the party.
“It was in the light of this reaction that PTI has decided to withdraw their name,” they said informing the media about the decisions of Islamabad meeting.
Fawad said that it was decided in the party's core committee meeting that it would not be wise to create a controversy [over nomination of caretaker chief minister] which may escalate further.
“In order to end the disagreement it has been decided to take back the name of Mr Khosa and propose new names”, they concluded.
Sources privy to the PTI huddle in Islamabad said that there was serious disagreement within the party over nomination of Nasir Khosa.
They said that Jahangir Tareen group was supporting the name of Mr Khosa while Shah Mehmood Qureshi's group was bitterly opposed to theirs name.
Islamabad meeting decisions
As far the details of the Khan-chaired meeting, the party top brass strongly criticised the Punjab government over the irregularities worth Rs166 billion found in the audit report of 56 companies.
The leadership directed Shafqat Mehmood to bring details of the massive irregularities before the nation.
On the issue of last-minute appointments, two committees were formed to review and analyse the appointments in Punjab, Sindh and the centre.
A committee comprising Fawad Choudhry, Shafqat Mehmood and Babar Awan will look into the appointments made in the centre and Punjab while the second committee comprising Dr Arif Alvi and Liaqat Jatoi will assess the appointments made in Sindh by the outgoing PPP regime.
The party central leadership congratulated the people of Fata for the long-awaited merger into KP and also demanded of the Election Commission of Pakistan to make arrangements and issue date for the elections in Fata.
The PTI said that it was all set to contest elections in every nook and corner of the country.
During the meeting, Central Additional Secretary General Arshad Daad was directed to make district level reconciliation committees.
Moreover, it has been decided to hold meetings of the parliamentary board and start the process of issuing tickets to the candidates and the leadership also deliberated on the strategy to address possible disputes expected to arise as a result of the distribution of tickets.
Legal notice to journalist
The PTI has served a legal notice to Aaj News anchorperson Ghareeda Farooqi, seeking unconditional apology over the allegations they had levelled against the PTI and its chief regarding the nomination of the KP caretaker chief minister.
PTI leader Babar Awan has sent the legal notice to the anchorperson on behalf of central media department head Iftikhar Durrani, seeking unconditional apology over their unwarranted tweets in which they had levelled serious allegations against the PTI and its leadership.
The notice demanded Farooqi to immediately remove the malicious tweets and a tender apology within seven days or pay Rs1 billion as damages, otherwise, all legal remedies available under the law would be availed by the PTI.
The notice said that how someone could accuse Imran Khan of corruption who has dedicated their life to fighting corruption.
“The relentless pursuit of the Panama Papers and kicking out more than a dozen MPAs from the government risking their party's government in KP, are the instances which shows their commitment to a corruption-free Pakistan,” Durrani said.
They said that Farooqi must withdraw their insulting allegations and tender unconditional apology immediately.
Meanwhile, some more politicians from south Punjab on Wednesday joined the PTI. They included Raees Mahboob from Rahim Yar Khan; Imam Buksh Jatoi, the brother of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi and their son Shah Nawaz Jatoi and former MPA Agha Imtiaz Ali Khan Babar.

Rock superstars Queen with frontman Adam Lambert will rock the UK with dates including Leeds and Sheffield Arenas, it was announced today.
As part of a 24-date European tour they play Leeds, First Direct Arena on Tuesday, December 6 and Sheffield Arena on Friday, December 8.
The tour will showcase a spectacular new stage production and a set list, which the band hints will provide some surprises.
It is expected the set list will pay tribute to the 40th anniversary this year of Queen's biggest-selling studio album, 1977's News of the World - which yielded the immortal anthems We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions.
The shows will mark the band's first full British tour in almost three years, having last performed across the UK in January 2015 when they played 10 sold out shows.
For their 2017 tour, the band will unveil a brand-new show including a specially designed state-of-the-art production.
Queen drummer and co-founder Roger Taylor insists the 2017 today said the tour “will look entirely different to the show we took around before".
They said: "Production has really changed a lot, the things you can do now, you have a much broader palette, the technology has really come along. But we don't use it all. We don't play to click track. It's 100% live. We're planning on doing stuff we either haven't done before or haven't done for a long time. We started as an albums band, that's what we were. The fact that we had hits was just a byproduct.”
Guitarist Brian May confirms Queen's 2017 shows will have a more ambitious musical agenda.
They said: “The general public knows the hits, so you've got to cater for that, but we can chuck in a few things that people really don't expect. We'll do quite a bit more of that this time around. There are so many dimensions to Adam, which of course fits with our music. They can get down and do the rock stuff really dirty, and you have all those dimensions, and we can explore that even more.”
We Will Rock You...Queen and Adam Lambert announce UK tour.
Adam Lambert welcomes the challenge of digging deeper into the band's canon of classics.
They said: “What people should know if they came to the shows a couple of years back, is obviously we will still be playing the big hit songs you know and love from Queen, but we thought it would be good to challenge ourselves a bit.
“Change it up a little bit, change the visuals, change all the technology, change the set list to some degree. We will probably be pulling some other songs out of the Queen catalogue which we haven't done before, which I am very excited about.”
Today's announcement comes just weeks after details emerged of a 26-date summer tour of North America. The band will now return to Europe later this year for a series of 24 dates.

Their only UK appearance in 2016 was a one-off headlining set at the closing night of the Isle of Wight Festival, part of a 15-date European summer festival tour. Isle of Wight festival organiser John Giddings credited the band with “the greatest show we have ever had”.

Polish Parliamentary Speaker Marek Kuchciński opens a two-day visit to Norway on Tuesday, at the invitation of Olemic Thommessen, President of the Norwegian Parliament.
The programme of the visit includes talks with members of the Norwegian parliamentary commissions for foreign affairs and defence, as well as the heads of the Norwegian parliamentary delegations to the Parliamentary Assemblies of NATO, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Joint Parliamentary Committee of the European Economic Area.
Kuchciński is also to discuss energy security, Eastern policy and bilateral economic cooperation with Prime Minister Erna Solberg and King Harald V.
The programme of the visit also includes a meeting with the Polish community in Norway and a wreath-laying ceremony at the memorial and graves of Polish WWII airmen and other Poles who lost their lives on Norwegian territory in 1940-1945.

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Monday (December 11) gave strong signs on the possible resumption of bilateral cricketing ties with Pakistan.
After the board's Special General Meeting in Delhi, BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary told media persons that "if the government agrees, there will be space for India-Pakistan bilateral series."

The Indian government has not given any go-ahead to Indo-Pak bilateral series since the last one (a short limited-overs series) was held in India in 2012. But the arch-rivals have not played a full bilateral series since 2007.

Since then, India have played against Pakistan only in ICC events, most recently in the Champions Trophy in England.

India ended cricketing ties with Pakistan in the wake of 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed more than 160 people and nearly brought nuclear-armed arch-enemies to the brink of war.
But Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has been desperately pushing for the resumption of ties, and even threatened to take legal action against BCCI for not honouring a memorandum of understanding signed in 2014.
“Our case is that the BCCI signed a MoU with us in 2014 to play six bilateral series, starting with our home series, which they have not done as yet. Secondly they have avoided playing us in bilateral series since 2008 although they have no issues playing against us in ICC events,” the then PCB chairperson Najam Sethi had said while talking about a possible compensation claim.
Brisbane: Tim Puetz and Jan-Lennard Struff won a thrilling doubles clash to give Germany a 2-1 lead after the second day of their World Group Davis Cup tie against Australia in Brisbane on Saturday.
The German duo silenced the big crowd at Pat Rafter Arena as they overcame John Peers and Matthew Ebden 6-4, 6-7 (1), 6-2, 6-7 (4), 6-4 in just over three-and-a-quarter hours.
The Germans made a late switch to their doubles team, bringing in Struff for Peter Gojowcyzk.
Struff played alongside Puetz in the World Group playoffs against Portugal last year, when they also won in five sets.
They also made the semi-finals of the Australian Open in doubles last month.
But it was the lesser known Puetz who shone on a gloomy Brisbane afternoon.
The 30-year-old, who is ranked 140 in the world in doubles and 293 in singles, was the more solid of the German pairing, their beautifully disguised forehand constantly causing the Australians trouble.
"He's in their team for a reason -- they're a world class team and we know to expect the best from them," Ebden said.
German captain Michael Kohlmann said they had had a good feeling about the match once they knew Australia hadn't decided to bring Nick Kyrgios in for Ebden.
"In my mind they (Peers and Ebden) hadn't played together before, or not a lot, and I knew my guys know each other pretty well," they said.
"In Davis Cup it's not only about the tennis, it's also about how you put your emotions together, how you connect.
"And in this I had a feeling that my guys would connect better together."
The tie will now hinge on Sunday's first reverse singles between Kyrgios and world number five Alexander Zverev.
"We are in a good position, 2-1 up, but we know it's not all over," Kohlmann said.
"I think that if Nick is on, if he's feeling it, he's tough to play for everyone, not just Sascha (Zverev).
"If he's serving like they did on Friday (when they blasted 21 aces past Struff) he's a tough opponent for everyone.
"I guess that Nick is not orthodox, not a rhythm player. That makes it difficult for Sascha.
"But tomorrow is a different circumstance -- Sascha doesn't have the pressure to deliver at 1-2.
"Being 2-1 up might change the mental game and the mental game right now is pretty big."
If Kyrgios can level the tie, the decider will likely be between Struff, the world number 58, and 18-year-old Alex de Minaur, ranked 81 places below the German.
De Minaur pushed Zverev for almost four hours in Friday's first singles match but Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt said they had no intention of replacing them with Brisbane's John Millman, who always plays well on their home court.
"We're a long way from beaten," Hewitt said.
"Tomorrow's going to be a big day but the boys are looking forward to it."

Former Director-General of National Human Rights Commission Chidi Odinkalu is worried over the Federal Government's handling of the killing of Nigerians abroad.bHe spoke on the sidelines of Human Rights Fiesta on Monday in Abuja.
According to him, the Federal Government did not do anything over the death of six Nigerian females abroad recently.“If one white person gets killed in France, our president sends a condolence message,” Odinkalu said.
"It is disappointing that our president does not take it seriously when Nigerians are killed. Rather, we get condolence messages being sent out to the rest of the world when their own people are killed. "If all the Nigerians being killed don't matter, and one white person killed matters to our president, that tells that you have a lot of work to do.
ISLAMABAD - Soon after assuming office, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has taken some administrative measures to spruce up the functioning of various ministries and divisions.
On the other hand, many in the Parliament including their cabinet colleagues believe that their rule would be more or less a continuation of their predecessor's policies and development agenda.
Background interviews with parliamentarians and some cabinet members reveal that by and large the lawmakers sitting on both sides of the aisle viewed that no change in policies and development agenda of government was expected due to replacement of the prime minister.
They were of the view that in a relatively brief period of just 10 months Shahid Khaqan Abbasi would not be in a position to bring some marked changes in the government policies.
State Minister for Information Marriyum Aurangzeb, who was holding the same portfolio in former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's cabinet, said that changing of the guards at the top level would not bring any change in the policies of the PML-N government and the incumbent premier would carry forward the development agenda of Nawaz Sharif who wanted to see Pakistan transformed into an economic power.
They further said that more or less the same team of ministers were part of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi's cabinet and all of them would continue with the development agenda devised in their respective ministries.
Abbasi in their maiden speech in the Parliament as prime minister also hinted at following in the footsteps of their predecessor and prioritised the completion of the development projects underway especially those related to power generation,--- the main target of the ruling PML-N to bring an end to loadshedding before the next general elections.
Initially, their entry was for the interim period of 45 to 50 days, the time required for election of Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif as MNA to help them become prime minister and carryout rest of the mandated term of government.
But later, after detailed discussion and deliberations on the issue, it was decided that Shehbaz Sharif should stay back in Punjab, and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi would continue as prime minister for the rest of the term.
As the ruling PML-N enjoys a comfortable majority in the Lower House of the Parliament the new chief executive will not face any major challenge from the opposition parties.
The major challenge before Abbasi would be handling the cabinet that includes political heavyweights such as Ishaq Dar, Khawaja Asif, Rana Tanvir and few others who would hardly follow their dictates, a senior parliamentarian from the main opposition party commented.
They further said that mainly the Prime Minister's office would be run from Raiwind and Nawaz Sharif would be the de facto premier, and as already said and admitted by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi they would carry forward the development agenda of Nawaz Sharif.
The directives of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi that in future the ministers would not need any prior permission for going abroad in connection with official engagements was only meant to avoid bringing the senior lot in the federal cabinet in the subservience of the chief executive, they added.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Mushahidullah Khan spoke high of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and said that they were a highly-qualified person and being a senior Parliamentarian their grip on issues was quite strong.
They admitted that although the policies of the government would remain the same but at the same time every person had their own personality and work pattern, which would become clear in the days to come.
The climate change minister said that with the complete backing of the former prime minister and support of the federal cabinet members Shahid Khaqan Abbasi would be a strong and effective prime minister.
Sources in the Prime Minister's Office informed The Nation that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, unlike their predecessor, stay late in the office to clear the files coming from various ministries and divisions.
It was further informed that Abbasi was not in habit of keeping backlog and was used to clear the office work on a daily basis.
These sources said that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was running their office from Prime Minister's House and most of their office work was diverted to the Prime Minister's House as they were not a regular visitor of PM Office.
The sources said that on the other hand Abbasi's centre of activities was the Prime Minister's Office and they went to PM House only when required in connection with some meetings with foreign dignitaries.
The coalition partners in the federal government had all reposed confidence in the policies and decisions of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and assured that they would extend cooperation to whosoever the ruling PML-N would install as the new chief executive of the country.
After taking oath of their office on August 1st, the very next day Abbasi had taken briefing on the functioning of the Prime Minister's Office and also disposed of routine office work despite the fact that for the whole day they remained busy discussing and finalising the names of their cabinet members with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and other senior party leaders.
Political analysts said that there was no doubt Abbasi would be carrying forward the legacy of their predecessor.
They said that even then Abbasi had a lot of space to show their talent and abilities and being the chief executive they would definitely leave their imprints in the next eight to 10 months in office.
Within 10 days of assuming office, Khaqan Abbasi merged some ministries and departments and chopped a few, to spruce up functioning of the government.
The major structural changes introduced by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi included bringing Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) once again under their head, formation of Ministry of Energy by merging the power and petroleum ministries.
Similarly, Ministry of Water Resources now have one constituent division that is Water Resources Division. The business of the existing divisions of Water and Power and Petroleum and Natural Resources has been distributed between the two new divisions accordingly.
Ministry of Postal Services now have one constituent division that is the Postal Services Division.
The business of the Communications Division to the extent of postal services has now been transferred to the new division, while residual business remains with the Communications Division.
Ministry of Commerce and Textiles, with two constituent divisions, namely: Commerce Division; and Textile Division. The current business of the two existing divisions of commerce and textile industry has been placed under the new ministry accordingly.
Ministry of Statistics, with one constituent division namely: Statistics Division. Ministry of Privatisation, with one constituent division called Privatisation Division, while Ministry of Narcotics Control that now have one constituent division to be named as Narcotics Control Division.
Interestingly, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has kept the Planning Division under their control besides the Energy Division probably to expedite work on the CPEC-related projects particularly relating to power generation so that the government should bring to an end loadshedding from the country by the end of this year.
The placement of the CPEC and the Energy Division under their head was only to remove the managerial hiccups and undue delay in the execution of these projects, a ruling party parliamentarian commented.
Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Sheikh Aftab said that change in the chief executive would not affect the government policies and the focus of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi would also be on the development agenda of former premier Nawaz Sharif and of course the guidance of their Quaid would also be there.
Sources in the ruling PML-N said that those steps on part of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi were taken to further streamline and spruce up the functioning of those ministries and divisions. Prime Minister Abbasi's visit to Karachi on Saturday last along with Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal also showed that peace and stability in the port city was still on the top of the priority list, which explicitly showed the continuity in government policies.
A senior parliamentarian commenting on the work of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that they seemed impressive in the first 10 days in office but their real test would be in the Parliament and their dealing with the main opposition parties in evolving consensus on the constitutional amendments some of which are quite controversial such as forming National Accountability Commission and Electoral Reform Bill.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China brought 12.89 million rural people out of poverty in 2017, cutting its overall poverty rate to 3.1 percent, the official Xinhua news agency said late on Thursday, citing government data.
China's ruling Communist Party has been making efforts to tackle deep-rooted poverty in its countryside, and aims to raise the annual income of all its residents above the official poverty line of 2,300 yuan ($365.26) by 2020.
A total of 68.53 million rural people have been lifted out of poverty over the 2012-2017 period, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
China cut its poverty rate to 3.1 percent by the end of last year, down from 4.5 percent a year earlier, but it still has 30.46 million rural people living below the 2,300 yuan poverty line.
The country has recently focused on developing new industries like eco-tourism as well as encouraging the planting of cash crops in poor rural regions.
However, China's graft watchdog warned on Wednesday that tackling corruption and malpractice in poverty relief was one of its major tasks over the coming three years, and called for harsh punishments for officials who misuse funds.
In a statement, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said a township official in the northwestern region of Xinjiang was fired and stripped of their party membership after being accused of embezzling 1.73 million yuan in relief funds.

YORK, Pa. (AP)  Authorities say the son of a Pennsylvania mayor punched them in the face, knocking them to the ground, and kicked them several times in their back, head and face before a bystander intervened.
The York Dispatch reports (http://bit.ly/2wCCdLF ) 30-year-old Brandon Anderson attacked York Mayor Kim Bracey last Saturday at their campaign headquarters. Authorities say they were arrested at the scene and charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor.
Bracey released a statement Friday night saying their son is battling an opioid addiction. They said no family is immune from the drug epidemic and "we must do everything in our power to solve it."
The two-term mayor is seeking re-election.

GTA V mod OpenIV pulled after Take-Two cease-and-desist order "We feared that this day would come, and now it's here. The day when GTA modding was declared illegal"

The popular Grand Theft Auto modding tool OpenIV will no longer be distributed, a "hard decision" taken by its creator after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from Take-Two Interactive.
In a post on the GTAforums - spotted by Eurogamer - OpenIV's lead developer GooD-NTS said the team had "decided to agree" with a takedown letter it received from Take-Two. "We feared that this day would come," GooD-NTS wrote. "And now it's here. The day when GTA modding was declared illegal."
GooD-NTS conceded that GTA mods, which have existed since Grand Theft Auto III, have always been a "gray zone" and "a battlefield between lawyers and PR." However, OpenIV has been in development for nearly a decade, and its team had "tried to play as nice as possible" to avoid legal issues.
"Strictly following of Civil Code of Russia (only reverse engineering for interoperability), only clean-room reverse engineering, no distribution of original data and code, and absolutely no messing with [GTA] Online," were the measures listed by GooD-NTS. However, on June 5, the OpenIV team received Take-Two's cease-and-desist letter, which claimed that the modding tools would, "allow third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation Take-Two's rights."
"Spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive, and all the money in the world can't compensate the loss of time"
GooD-NTS criticised the letter as "illiterate both technically and grammatically," but the OpenIV team is not willing to go to court "yet again" to prove that modding is a legal, fair use activity.
"Going to court will take at least few months of our time and huge amount of efforts, and, at best, we'll get absolutely nothing," GooD-NTS wrote. "Spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive, and all the money in the world can't compensate the loss of time.
"It was a hard decision, but when any modding activity has been declared illegal we can't see any possibilities to continue this process, unless top management of Take-Two company makes an official statement about modding, which can be used in court."
The response to the OpenIV team's decision sparked an immediate outpouring of surprise and anger at Take-Two on GTAforums. The (at the time of writing) 27 pages of comments criticised the publisher for greed and a short-sighted view of the value of mods to Grand Theft Auto's PC community.
However, Take-Two has some form in this area. In November 2015, modders working with GTA's multiplayer reported being visited by private investigators working on the publisher's behalf. However, Rockstar has made it clear that it appreciates the work of modders, and that its modding policy for both GTA IV and GTA V - the two games OpenIV was created for - allowed the practice.
"Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing," Rockstar said in a statement back in 2015. "It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways."
According to GooD-NTS, avoiding GTA Online was one of the rules the OpenIV team lived by in order to avoid trouble. It isn't clear whether Take-Two's actions signify a change in policy, but we have reached out for clarification.

This is not Dorothy Hamills figure skating of old.
Theatre On Ice is like synchronized swimming on frozen water, but performed by a team of 14-20 skaters in costumes elaborate enough for a Broadway production, all choreographed and set to music, telling a story in under six minutes.
And it is happening right here in Southeast Michigan, April 20-23, when the Theatre On Ice 2017 Nations Cup comes to Yost Arena in Ann Arbor.
Theatre On Ice is a form of competitive figure skating that combines the grace of figure skating with the excitement of theater and dance.

The Ice House Skating Academy in Hartland, founded in 2005, is home to the Harmony Theatre Company, which won the bid to host the 2017 Nations Cup. The competition will feature more than 600 skaters from 34 different teams representing six countries. This is the first time the international completion has been held in Michigan, and 33 skaters from Oakland County will be competing on the various Harmony teams.
The leaders of Harmony are mother/daughter team Michelle and Piercyn Hunt. Michelle acts as director and started the project at Ice House because they is a very creative person and likes a challenge. They saw this new thing that everyone was trying and they jumped right on it. Its been eight years and weve been very successful, says daughter Piercyn.
It was a no-brainer for Hunt to be involved with their moms new endeavor. They have skated since age 2 and recalls having a little pair of skates they carried around in their bag at the rink. They could skate whenever they wanted, and their favorite part was the creative performance side of skating. Thats exactly what Theatre On Ice is, Hunt says.
The competition consists of two parts, a Choreographic Exercise and a Free Skate event. The first involves skaters showcasing their technical skill in three specific areas chosen by an international committee each year. The Free Skate is where the creative storytelling and costumes come into play.
Hunt coaches the adult, intermediate, novice, and junior teams while competing on the senior team.
It gives kids a way to be successful but not necessarily go to the Olympics. Sure, I cant do seven quads in my long program, but I can skate on this really amazing team and I can get the USA jacket and I can be successful in skating. Its just a different avenue, a different outlet, they said during a phone conversation from the Skating Academy.
Three athletes taking full advantage of that different outlet are the Vermillion sisters of New Hudson. Jessie, 16, Mandy, 13, and Emma, 11, have all been skating since they were toddlers, but got into Theater on Ice when the Ice House launched the relatively new concept out of a pre-existing ice synchro program. They participate on two of the four teams Harmony is sending to the event. Jessie is on the Junior Team, while Mandy and Emma skate on the Novice Team and are 5 time National Champions. The girls agree that having sisters in the same sport is helpful, because they always have someone to ask questions and it gives them something to bond over.
Jessie and Mandy both say acting out stories in front of an audience is the highlight, while Jessie pointed out the valuable lessons learned from being a part of the sport.
Persistence from skating has led on to me having persistence to get things done in my actual life, they say.
The competitions have taken the family to France, where Harmony won in 2015. Emma recalls seeing the Eiffel Tower and other Parisian sites. They also are grateful for the chance to meet new people. If I didnt do Theatre On Ice then I probably would have never gone to France, they say.
Mandy recalls another experience during the Paris trip that was So much fun: The Harmony team was in the locker room when a team from France started singing Let It Go in French. So the Harmony team joined them  in English. It was a moment of bonding they say, and probably the highlight of the trip at the rink.
Mandy looks forward to meeting new people at the upcoming Nations Cup, and wants people from around the world to come to Michigan and compete in Ann Arbor.
Shes keeping a secret of what locker room song theyve been working on during the long hours of ice time this year.
 Theatre on Ice Nations Cup is Thursday-Sunday, April 20-23 at Yost Ice Arena, 1116 S. State St., Ann Arbor. Start times vary by competition level. Tickets are $15 for daily events, $50 for an all-event pass at 2017nationscup.com/product/tickets/.
Jakarta: Indian shuttlers Kidambi Srikanth and H S Prannoy advanced to the second round of the men's singles competition at the Indonesia Super Series premier on Wednesday.
The world No. 29 Prannoy saw off 20th ranked Anthony Sinisuka Ginting 21-13 21-18 in a 43-minute battle. They will next face top seeded Malaysian Lee Chong Wei.
Srikanth then staved off a challenge from Hong Kong's Wong Wing Ki Vincent 21-15 17-21 21-16 in a 56-minute match.  They are likely to clash with fourth seeded Jan O Jorgensen of Denmark next.
After back-to-back titles at Singapore and Thailand, B Sai Praneeth bowed out in the opening round following a 14-21 18-21 loss against second seeded Son Wan Ho of Korea in 40 minutes.
The men's doubles a pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty also suffered a 9-21 19-21 loss against Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto.
It was also curtains for Ashwini Ponnappa and N Sikki Reddy after the duo suffered a 21-19 19-21 13-21 loss to the Indonesia combo of Dian Fitriani and Nadya Melati.
Blame it on the movies and television, but people tend to think of robots as tireless factory workers or as soulless automatons bent on destruction. For UCI's Sumner Norman, they're all about healing and rehabilitation. The fifth-year doctoral candidate in mechanical & aerospace engineering studies robotics-based therapies to help stroke victims.
“I see an entirely different side to these technologies,” they say. “The main goal of my research is to demonstrate that machines and humans can work well together.”
Norman belongs to the biorobotics lab group headed by David Reinkensmeyer, UCI professor of biomedical engineering, mechanical & aerospace engineering, and anatomy & neurobiology. Members develop robotic and mechanical devices to help people recover from stroke- or accident-induced neurological damage.
The grad student says he's focused on aiding victims of stroke because it's the leading cause of disability in the United States.
“There are so many of them, and as our population continues to get older, the numbers are only going to go up,” says Norman, who will be representing UCI and The Henry Samueli School of Engineering on Graduate Research Advocacy Day in Sacramento on April 19.
A stroke can damage parts of the brain that control speech and motor functions. For decades, patients have undergone physical rehabilitation to regain the ability to walk or use their arms. Norman's work is dedicated to adding a technology component to movement therapy that's tailored to each individual's specific needs in order to achieve better outcomes.
“We work spatially, looking for different areas of the brain that show up during movements that are more successful,” they say. “We connect patients with a robot and let them move with it. We can see when they do better and when they do worse. We look for regions of the brain that are headed in the right direction but may be difficult to access.”
Robotics developed in the UCI lab provide motion assistance and amplification to stroke victims. Another approach uses technologies to join patients with a computer so they can play immersive, motivating video games. To track therapeutic progress, the systems record and store data that can be shared with doctors and therapists.
“The idea isn't to replace human healthcare professionals but to work with them,” Norman says. “The robots are a tool for recovery.”
Their core project is the creation of a computer interface that patients wear on their heads. The electroencephalogram device searches for brain states that are correlated with movement success. According to the grad student, there are parts of the brain that are capable of recovery post-stroke. The objective is to use the device to train these regions to perform tasks previously handled by now-damaged areas.
This technique, Norman says, is totally safe, noninvasive and pain-free. “What we do is on the surface of the scalp,” they say. “It looks like a swimming cap with electrodes implanted in it. Patients are completely comfortable and at ease when using the device.”
They note that while many robotics researchers are focused on producing artificial limbs for amputees, their work to help stroke victims presents some unique challenges.
“Rather than a replacement, it's a rehabilitation,” Norman says. “It's actually a harder problem, because when someone's lost an arm, you can build a new one to go in its place. Someone who's had a stroke still has an arm and doesn't want to wear something robotic all the time.
“Our goal is to have patients come in and use the robot in the clinic but then go home with their own arm, not ours.”
Nate is slowly becoming better organized as it treks through the far western Caribbean Sea. Because of its better organization and favorable environment, gradual strengthening is likely over the next day or two as Nate moves quickly northward. It's predicted to make landfall along the northern Gulf Coast as a Category 1 hurricane.
The National Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for all central Alabama counties. Additionally, a hurricane warning is in effect from as far west as the Grand Isle in Louisiana to as far east as the Alabama/Florida border. A Hurricane Warning means that hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within that area.
Per the NHC, a warning is typically issued 36 hours before the first anticipated occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds. These strong winds are expected to impact the region nearest to the coastline by Saturday night.
#Nate is strengthening and is now up to 60mph. It's also rapidly moving northward at 21 mph. Early Sunday is going to be interesting. pic.twitter.com/ax5MwrbvUs — Eric Snitil (@EricSnitilWx) October 6, 2017

[READ MORE: Gov. Ivey declares state of emergency ahead of Tropical Storm Nate]
WHAT TO EXPECT: The center of Nate will move through west-central Alabama, putting most of our area on the eastern side of the circulation. This means enhanced wind, isolated tornadoes and the chance of significant power outages. The greatest chance of that is roughly along and west of I-65. Flooding is unlikely due to the storm's fast forward motion, but we'll mention a very low risk of isolated flooding in the far western counties of Alabama.
WHAT TO DO: Prepare for the possibility of power outages; have candles, batteries, flashlights and any important medical supplies close at hand. Nonperishable food items and mechanical (non-electric) can openers could come in handy, too. Avoid driving Sunday morning if at all possible.
TIMING: Outer bands could bring some scattered rain and storms to the state Saturday afternoon, but the chief timeframe of concern is from midnight Saturday night through noon Sunday.
RAPID INTENSIFICATION? The key question surrounding Nate is the intensity forecast. There are three scenarios. The most likely is that Nate gradually intensifies as it moves northward. But, there is also a small risk that Nate undergoes "rapid intensification" in the central Gulf of Mexico tomorrow. If that happens, the impact to our area will increase.
ALABAMA AND FLORIDA BEACHES: We anticipate storm surge flooding (4-8'), torrential rain, hurricane force wind and isolated tornadoes along the Alabama and Florida panhandle beaches. The weather will begin to go downhill quickly Saturday and will be very rough tomorrow afternoon through Sunday morning. Conditions at the beach will improve quickly Sunday afternoon, and the weather should be very nice along our Gulf Coast Monday and beyond.
Mobile Bay takes the first hit with storm surge and wind issues accompanying heavy squalls. As Nate tracks inland, it's fairly compact structure will move fairly quickly northeast. East of the center, tropical feeder bands will pose a spin-up tornado threat across the entire viewing area after midnight Saturday night and through the day Sunday as the storm pushes through. The core of the storm will produce tropical storm force sustained winds, but squalls east of the center will produce gusts of similar caliber at times
Areas along and west of I-65 experience the highest wind speeds as they are closest to the center track of Nate. Winds could gust in the 45-60 mph range if we take the current NHC official forecast at face value. Winds in that range would be sufficient for some downed trees and power outages. But it's important not to get too caught up in these initial numbers as intensity/track fluctuations can dramatically alter them. Nate appears to be fairly quick-hitting, so flooding doesn't appear to be a major concern. Rainfall totals in the 2-4"+ range are possible along and west of I-65.
East of I-65, winds and rainfall totals are slightly lower. But the spin-up tornado threat is the same for the entire viewing area.
In a best-case scenario, Nate remains a Tropical Storm and tracks west of Alabama. We get gusty bands of heavy rain with isolated tornadoes, but widespread damage and power outages are avoided. We don't avoid impacts. But we avoid significant impacts. The worst case would be a stronger hurricane tracking closer toward Mobile. More wind, more surge, more problems. The eventual solution likely lies somewhere in between. But we must prepare for the latter as failing to do so could be dangerous.

LONDON (Reuters) - President Hassan Rouhani pledged on Wednesday that Iran will stand firm against U.S. threats to cut Iranian oil sales, and said Washington had not thought about the consequences of such a move.
"The Americans say they want to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero... It shows they have not thought about its consequences," Rouhani was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on an official visit to Vienna.
Rouhani's comments echoed their remarks on Tuesday when they hinted at a threat to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if Washington presses ahead with its goal of forcing all countries to stop buying Iranian oil.
Rouhani did not elaborate, but Iranian officials have in the past threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, in retaliation for any hostile U.S. action against Iran.
A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander praised Rouhani's remarks on Wednesday, said the Guards were ready to implement such a policy.
Major-General Qassem Soleimani said in a letter published on IRNA: "I kiss your (Rouhani's) hand for expressing such wise and timely comments, and I am at your service to implement any policy that serves the Islamic Republic."
Soleimani is the commander of the Quds force, in charge of foreign operations for the Revolutionary Guards.
The United States pulled out of a multinational deal in May to lift sanctions against Iran in return for curbs to its nuclear programme. Washington has since told countries they must halt all imports of Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face U.S. financial measures, with no exemptions.
Rouhani, who is now in Vienna trying to salvage the nuclear deal, said U.S. sanctions against Iran were a "crime and aggression", and called on European governments and others to stand up to Trump's policies against Tehran.
"SELF-HARM"
"Iran will survive this round of U.S. sanctions as it has survived them before. This U.S. government will not stay in office forever ... But history will judge other nations based on what they do today," Rouhani said.
Earlier in the day Rouhani told reporters that "if the remaining signatories can guarantee Iran's benefits, Iran will remain in the nuclear deal without the United States."
Rouhani said that Trump's decision to withdraw from the accord was "strange" as it was "against U.S. national interests and the interests of other countries."
A senior Iranian oil official said on Wednesday that Trump's pressure on international firms not to buy Iranian oil will drive prices higher and end up hurting their own economy.
Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said oil should not be used as a weapon or to make political gains, according to the Iran oil ministry news agency SHANA.
"Trump's demand that Iranian oil should not be bought, and (his) pressures on European firms at a time when Nigeria and Libya are in crisis, when Venezuela's oil exports have fallen due to U.S. sanctions, when Saudi's domestic consumption has increased in summer, is nothing but self harm," they were quoted as saying.
"It will increase the prices of oil in the global markets," they said. "At the end it is the American consumer who will pay the price for Mr. Trump's policy," they added.
The European Union, once Iran's biggest oil importer, has vowed to keep the 2015 deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran's oil and investment flowing. But European officials acknowledge that U.S. sanctions make it difficult to give Tehran guarantees.
Foreign ministers from EU signatories to the nuclear deal Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China, will meet with Iranian officials on Friday in Vienna to discuss how to keep the accord alive.

Interesting information about legendary Scunthorpe United striker Barrie Thomas has been discovered, including their call-up for the England youth team captained by all-time great of the game, Manchester United's Duncan Edwards.
Ask Scunthorpe United fans who are 60-plus to name the greatest Iron striker they saw play for the club and Barrie, from the 1960s, and Steve Cammack, two decades later, will feature in most replies.
Barrie's legendary feats leading the line for Scunthorpe have been well documented.
Those goalscoring exploits seemed set to help the Iron secure promotion to the top flight before their controversial sale to Newcastle United in 1962.
They also netted five times against Luton Town during their second spell at the Old Show Ground in the final match of the 1964/65 campaign.
But relatively few details of their early life in football and the end of their playing career have been reported – until now.
Barrie's days in the Football League were ended by a knee injury while at Barnsley, then in Division Four.
There was a farewell testimonial game for him, under lights at the Oakwell ground half a century ago.
Barrie's XI took on a Newcastle United side on Tuesday, November 26, 1968.
The souvenir match programme included details from the early and late parts of the goal ace's career.
As a teenager they began working life at the local coal-mine.
Born in Leicestershire during May 1937, they played amateur football watched by members of the mining community and eventually Leicester City scouts, signing for the Midlands club.
They also impressed the Football Association selectors, being chosen to play for England Youth – skippered by Duncan Edwards – against Holland.
Barrie's Football League debut came as a 17-year-old against Sheffield United on Christmas Day 1954.
Not long after that they scored their first hat-trick – against a Bolton Wanderers side that included their boyhood hero, England striker Nat Lofthouse.
Following National Service, Barrie decided to leave Leicester who had more experienced strikers like Arthur Rowley, Bill Gardiner and Andy Graver on their books.
With Mansfield Town they scored around almost 50 goals in two seasons before Scunthorpe snapped them up in 1959, while a second-tier team.
They had netted a very impressive 31 goals in 21 matches midway through the 1961/62 season when the directors sold them to Newcastle for £40,000.
For the Magpies they netted 48 times in two-and-a-half seasons before Scunthorpe bought them back for about half the original transfer fee.
Barrie remained with the Iron until November 11, 1966 when they went to Barnsley.
Having just moved into a new bungalow at Messingham, they elected to keep living in North Lincolnshire and drove to Yorkshire three days a week for training.
On the other non-playing days they would be “limbering up” at the Old Show Ground.
Having joined Barnsley well into the season, they still finished top scorer during 1966/67 with 10 league goals.
They were also on the mark in that season's FA Cup, scoring twice in a 3-1 first round with over Southport and the side's only goal in a 2-1 defeat at Cardiff in a third round replay.
While with Barnsley they scored their 200th Football League goal – a tremendous free-kick against Halifax Town at Oakwell on Easter Monday 1967 – and made their 300th league appearance.
They were the club's top scorer with eight goals when making what was to prove their final Football League appearance.
It came for Barnsley away to Doncaster Rovers at Belle Vue in December 1967.
This was their 43rd league start for the club, which went on to gain promotion from the basement section as runners-up in Division Four.
But an increasingly troublesome right knee never recovered and Barrie's playing contract at Oakwell was cancelled during the following season – “by mutual consent.”
Newcastle United – then managed by Joe Harvey – honoured their former centre-forward by sending a strong team to play in their testimonial match at Oakwell 50 years ago.
Well-known names included full-backs John Craggs and Ron Guthrie, Scottish international right winger Jackie Sinclair, and Jim Iley, whose former clubs included Tottenham Hotspur and Nottingham Forest.
After being forced to retire aged 31 from the Football League, the wheel turned full circle for Barrie.
They became team manager of Measham, the club with which they had started their career in Leicestershire.
At the time of their testimonial match at Oakwell in 1968, Measham FC were top of the Leicester Senior League.
Duncan Edwards – one of the famous (Sir Matt) Busby Babes – was one of the Manchester United players who lost their lives as a result of the Munich Air Disaster during 1958 on the way back from a European tie. The notable left-half was only 21 but had already gained 18 full England caps.
Hours ahead of the Xiaomi Mi 8 launch, company CEO Lei Jun has teased the smartphone's camera samples.
Marking its 8th anniversary Xiami is hosting an event today, that is 31 May. At the event, the company is expected to launch the Mi 8, Mi 8 SE and Mi Band 3. We will be covering the event live.
While we are still staring at the clock waiting for the event to kick off, Xiaomi's CEO, Lei Jun has dropped three camera samples of Mi 8 on their Weibo account.
The three image samples are of the same building, but clicked at a different time of the day. One of the images has been shot in the bright daylight, another in the evening during the sunset and the third one taken at night under low light.
At first look, these samples look quite impressive. On 30 May an image taken in low-light from Mi 8 SE was also spotted.
Mi 8 is expected to come with a dual camera setup with 20 MP (f/1.7 aperture) + 16 MP (f/2.0 aperture) sensor on the rear side and 16 MP sensor with an f/2.0 aperture on the front. It also features AI capabilities. We already know about the specifications of the devices.
Let us know what do you think about the images and is it better than the camera of other Xiaomi devices such as Mi Mix 2S and Redmi Note 5 Pro.

Josh Kelly “can't wait” to entertain their boxing public when they fight for the first time as a pro in the North East.
And the gifted 23-year-old insists they want to win fans and friends from all over this region when they headline the JD NXTGEN show in Newcastle next Friday.
I can't wait to box in my own backyard and entertain the crowd JOSH KELLY
Traditionally, Sunderland would be expected to get a rough ride when crossing the Tyne, but the fighter, from Ryhope, hopes for cheers not jeers.
Kelly, who was at the Academy of Light as a football-mad youngster, puts their 100% ring record on the line when they tackle South Shields boxer Tom Whitfield at the Walker Activity Dome.
“The support I've had so far, in such a short period of time, has been unreal,” said the Olympian.
“I can't wait to box in my own backyard and entertain the crowd.
“I'm coming to win – I'm not taking Tom Whitfield for granted – but I'm looking forward to showcasing my talent.
“I know I'm a Sunderland boy and I'm fighting in Newcastle, but that tribal thing is not what I'm about.
“I want fans from everywhere – I'd love to bring the cities and towns of the North East together.
“I'd love supporters liking me for my boxing, not for where I'm from.
“I want to unite fans.”
In fact, boxing crowds are generally known for backing the fighter rather than ‘team colours' – Newcastle stars have been supported at the Stadium of Light and Sunderland boxers cheered at the Metro Radio Arena and Lancastrian Suite.
It will be Kelly's third contest, having turned pro earlier this year with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom organisation.
They made a great start with a point win over Jay Byrne in Glasgow before following that up with their first stoppage success in Birmingham last month with a clinical KO against Spain's Jony Vina.
Kelly v Whitfield is just one part of a belter of a bill, which features two other unbeaten Wearside boxers.
Sunderland's Warren Baister will continue their climb up the cruiserweight ladder, while Hetton's super-middleweight fighter, Jordan King, looks to extend their 100% sequence to nine contests.
Sedgefield's Bradley Saunders makes their comeback from TWO broken hands, while Darlington's Stuart Hall is also in action.

BLANTYRE-(MaraviPost)-The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has set August this year as a month to hold primaries for identifying candidates for the 2019 tripartite elections.
President Peter Mutharika made the announcement in Blantyre on Tuesday when they officially opened the party's 3rd National elective convention.
President Mutharika said the party will put in place mechanisms to ensure that the forthcoming primary elections are free and fair.
“Soon somewhere in August and September we will have primaries and let me warn you that I will not impose any candidates in all the constituencies or wards”, said Mutharika.
They added:”nobody will be protected and I will not interfere in the electoral process, it will be an open primary election and am sure the best candidates will win”.
President Mutharika was therefore declared as DPP candidate for the 2019 tripartite elections.
The DPP leader therefore said for the party will have a landslide victory in 2019 hence having primaries to ensure that the playing field is leveled for all aspirants for people to choose their preferred candidates.
Opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) also announced that will also soon hold primaries in readiness for the 2019 polls.
MCP however is yet to announce dates for the exercise.
(Reuters) - Leicester City are well aware of the threat Swansea City pose in Saturday's Premier League clash following their wins over Liverpool and Arsenal in their last two games, defender Ben Chilwell said.
The relegation-threatened Welsh club climbed to 19th in the league after a 3-1 victory over sixth-placed Arsenal in midweek. The result at the Liberty stadium followed another home win over the in-form Liverpool last week.
“Swansea won their last two matches against good opposition so we know the threats they cause and we know they're probably really confident at the moment,” Chilwell told the club's website (www.lcfc.com).
“They're still low in the table and they're struggling to stay in the league, so they'll be hungry for that win again to keep their good run of form so they're on the up.”
Swansea struggled for consistency in the first half of the season and sacked manager Paul Clement in December after a poor run of results. Their replacement Carlos Carvalhal appears to have lifted the gloom at the club.
They have won consecutive league games for the first time this season and have collected 10 points from a possible 15 since Carvalhal took charge in December.
“It'll be good for them and their confidence going into the match after two wins. They'll definitely go into the game thinking they can get three points,” Chilwell said.
Leicester have also seen an upswing in their fortunes since Frenchman Claude Puel took over from Craig Shakespeare in October. However, the eighth-placed team come into the game on the back of a 2-1 defeat by Everton.
“But we think we can get three points as well, especially at home. We're confident we can beat them,” Chilwell added.
Cleveland Police force has been classed as “requiring improvement” in a new watchdog report.
In its most recent publication on ‘Police legitimacy', Them Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) reports that, not yet at the level required, the force has made good progress over the last 12 months.
It was rated as “good” for efficiency, while it is yet to be graded for effectiveness and legitimacy.
Areas of improvement include the force's Everyone Matters and the Transforming Professional Standards programmes.
Inspectors reported: “Cleveland Police understands the importance of treating people with fairness and respect.
“The force has a programme of work, known as ‘Everyone Matters', which focuses on improving the way the force serves its communities, supports its people and ensures its organisational processes are fair.
“The force is working to ensure that its processes are fair for people who come into contact with the police.
“Through a review of the professional standards department, the force is also working to ensure that its processes are fair for its workforce.”
Chief constable Iain Spittal said: “We have made significant improvements and I am pleased that HMICFRS has highlighted that, as a force, we ensure that our officers and staff understand the importance of treating people with fairness and respect.”
“Everyone Matters is about people.
“The people we work with, the people we protect and the people we serve.
“Everyone Matters is based around equality, diversity and human rights, and has been shaped in consultation with our staff and communities.
“Cleveland Police continues on its journey, making improvements, examining past conduct and behaviours, and working with our communities to ensure that we act in a way which both supports them and makes them stronger.
“In early 2018 our new Head of Standards and Ethics will take up their post and will mark a new milestone in our becoming, as we aspire to be, the country's leading centre of excellence for behaviours and standards.
“Old structures and process are being replaced and a new modern framework which further transforms how we deal with complaints and investigations is already being established.
“I joined Cleveland Police in June 2013 as Deputy Chief Constable to bring change to the organisation and work to improve the service which is delivered to the communities we serve.
“This HMICFRS report shows the progress we are making, and will continue to make, on this journey and demonstrates that this organisation has a huge appetite for improvement.”
The Fourth of July brings a jump in fires and gruesome injuries and runaway pets spooked by the noise. But there's a more widespread hazard from the yearly outburst of patriotic pyrotechnics: It reliably spikes air pollution so sharply it becomes dangerous for everyone to breathe. Independence Day and the day after consistently have some of the worst air quality of the year. With all those fireworks going off at once, levels of fine-particle pollution — a stew of tiny, lung-damaging specks of toxic soot, smoke and ash known as PM2.5 — surge several times higher than federal health standards across Southern California, air monitoring data show.

Digital network Brat is in production on its first multicam sitcom “ Hotel Du Loone ,” which is slated to air later this summer.
Chris Tallman, Mindy Sterling, Terri Ivens and Reinaldo Zavarce. “The Love Boat's” Ted Lange and “Hannah Montana” alum Jason Earles round out the group. The 10-episode series will stream on Brat 's YouTube channel. Set inside a wacky and wondrous hotel, the show is led by Hayley LeBlanc, a nine-year-old newcomer, with a supporting cast of “The Thunderman's”
“We're one of a handful of companies in the world broadcasting TV online for free,” said Rob Fishman, co-founder of Brat, said in a statement. “With new shows like this, we're doubling down on that proposition.”
“Hotel Du Loone” joins the recently announced “ A Girl Named Jo ,” a teen mystery series starring Annie LeBlanc and Addison Riecke, for Brat's summer releases. “A Girl Named Jo,” the network's first period drama, takes place in 1963, a decade after a factory fire had ruined a small town; LeBlanc's and Riecke's characters become unlikely friends from opposite sides of the tracks and uncover the community's complex history.
Brat's growing lineup of scripted content also includes both “Chicken Girls” and “Total Eclipse,” a high school drama starring “Dance Moms” alumna Mackenzie Ziegler that now records more than 10 million viewers a month, according to Brat representatives.
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's oil minister has asked OPEC to support their country against what they called "illegal, unilateral and extraterritorial sanctions" referring to the United States sanctions on the OPEC member after the U.S. pulled out of a nuclear deal with Tehran.
U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
"I would like to... seek OPEC's support in accordance with Article 2 of the OPEC Statute, which emphasises safeguarding the interests of member countries individually and collectively," Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said in a letter seen by Reuters.
The letter was addressed to the United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei, who holds OPEC presidency in 2018.

Police in India have arrested four people in connection with the theft of a “Game of Thrones” season 7 episode earlier this month that was leaked to piracy sites ahead of its premiere on HBO.
Law-enforcement officials in Mumbai arrested the four individuals, who are current or former employees of Prime Focus Technologies, an outside data-management vendor for Star India, HBO's pay-TV distribution partner in the country whose logo appeared as a watermark in the pirated copy. According to a report by India's Economic Times, police established the involvement of current and former Prime Focus staffers, leading to the Aug. 14 arrests.
Mumbai cops have charged the four individuals, whose identities were not disclosed, with criminal breach of trust and computer-related offenses.
The leak of “Game of Thrones” episode four from the current season via 21st Century Fox-owned Sky India is unrelated to the massive hack of HBO's systems in late July, in which unidentified hackers stole upwards of 1.5 terabytes of data. The standoff between HBO and the hacker or hackers — who have demanded a multimillion-dollar ransom to cease releasing the stolen material — continued Sunday with the leak of three episodes of the return of Larry David's “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and other series.
In the India case, links to the fourth episode of “Game of Thrones” season 7 appeared on a discussion board on Reddit on Aug. 4, two days before the episode's premiere. While the Reddit post was removed shortly after it went up, the episode — ripped in a low-quality format — had already begun circulating on piracy networks.
In a statement, Star India said the “Game of Thrones” leak was first of its kind in the company's history. “We are deeply grateful to the police for their swift and prompt action,” Star India said. “We believe that valuable intellectual property is a critical part of the development of the creative industry and strict enforcement of the law is essential to protecting it.”
The arrests in India were carried out after an initial investigation by a joint team from the office of Cyber & PAW, Government of Maharashtra and the office of DCP (Cyber), BKC, Mumbai. The officials said the investigation is ongoing.
When the Los Angeles Chargers made receiver Mike Williams the No. 7 overall draft pick last year, the team envisioned the rookie taking advantage of single coverage with Keenan Allen patrolling the slot and Travis Benjamin and Tyrell Williams as burners on the outside.
The plan never got off the ground as the Clemson product dealt with a back issue that wiped out their offseason program and the first five weeks of their rookie campaign.
Williams played in just 10 games, starting the season finale, and caught a total of 11 passes for 96 yards and zero scores. They caught a pass in just six tilts and earned more than one reception in two games -- with a high-water mark of five receptions for 38 yards in the home blowout over Buffalo.
This offseason Williams says he's healthy and ready to put the forgettable rookie season behind him.
"I'm excited about this year to not only prove to everybody else, but prove to myself that I know who I am and what I can be," they told the team's official website. "I'm real confident in my abilities. I wasn't capable of doing what I can do last year because of the injury. This offseason, I feel 100 percent. I'm ready to go out there and dominate. Everyone faces adversity. It shows what kind of player you are when you can bounce back from adversity. I'm looking to redeem myself and show everyone what I'm capable of doing."
Ricky Henne of the Chargers' official website points out that the team has a history of players bouncing back from injury-plagued rookie seasons. The three first-round picks prior to Williams -- Joey Bosa, Melvin Gordon, Jason Verrett -- each missed at least a quarter of their rookie seasons but made a Pro Bowl in Year 2.
Williams believes being healthy for this offseason will make the difference.
"It's totally different right now," they said. "My body feels a lot different. I'm excited to keep getting out there with my teammates and with Philip [Rivers]. We want to get that connection down. Last year, I was able to go out there and play, but I wasn't the Mike Williams I am used to being. I was limited in doing what I can do, and especially limited in what I do best, which is gone up and get the ball. My back limited me from doing those types of things. Now my back is right, I'm healthy and feeling great. I'm ready to go out there and show everyone they've got a great player."
The Chargers have the chance to be among the most dynamic offenses in the NFL if Williams can become a go-to red zone target alongside Allen and tight end Hunter Henry. At this stage, however, everything remains a projection with Williams.
An informal get together, open to all past pupils who attended the Princess Royal Girls C.S School in Batley, will take place this Saturday (2 June) from 2pm. The gathering will be held at the Bath Hotel in Dewsbury.
This is a change to the usual venue. The past pupils have held regular events over the past six years.
Hirokazu Kore-eda's Palme d'Or in Cannes for “Shoplifters” seems far away for most Japanese film-makers. Instead, a rare public war of words has now raised the question of whether movies in Japan are being made too cheaply. And is that damaging the industry?
In recent years, increasing numbers of filmmakers have redefined low budget to mean next to nothing. That has widened the gap between major Japanese studio productions, and the independent majority. It may also have led to the disappearance of most mid-budget films, where “Shoplifters” sits, together with many of the companies that once distributed them.
A recent example from the ultra-low category is “One Cut of the Dead,” a zombie comedy scripted and directed by 34-year-old Shinichiro Ueda. The film premiered in April at the Udine Far East Film Festival, Europe's largest showcase for Asian popular cinema, and finished a close second in the Audience Award vote.
Produced by Tokyo film school Enbu Seminar, of which Ichihashi is president, and financed partly by crowdfunding, “One Cut of the Dead” was made for $23,000 (JPY2.5 million). Its student cast paid to participate in what was essentially a school project.

On social media, Ueda and producer Koji Ichihashi expressed their joy at the Udine success. Other festivals took notice. And the box office prospects for the film's theatrical release, set for June 23, have brightened.
But not everyone shared Ueda and Ishihashi's glee. On May 10 Koji Fukada, whose “Harmonium” won Cannes' Un Certain Regard jury prize in 2016, took to Facebook to air their dismay. “If you speak as though enduring poverty to make a film is somehow normal and positive, today's excessively unfair industry will continue that way forever,” they said. “If you have the energy to make a film I'd like you expend it on raising money. Improve, if just a little, the industry system.”
Fukada is also co-founder of Independent Cinema Guild, an organization of film professionals that supports the indie sector with crowdfunding assistance, networking events and other initiatives. Their retort to Ueda sparked many comments from filmmakers who shared their discontent with poor on-set conditions, and a dislike for those who profited from them.
Another part of the dilemma is that Japanese films have, at least outwardly, done well, successfully pushing Hollywood into a minority share of the world's third largest theatrical market. Japanese films have increased their market share from 48% in 2007 to 55% in 2017, according to data from Eiren.
Similarly, a simple cost-benefit analysis may be misleading. Japanese films' $1.15 billion aggregate revenue last year was spread across 594 titles, implying a mean box office gross of $1.93 million per title. Average budgets in Japan may be $460,000 (JPY50 million). The ratio of budget to revenue looks healthy enough until the distorting effect of the top end is taken into account.
Industry giant, Toho has dominated the annual box office for decades, typically claiming seven or eight of the top ten titles. And it expects each of its releases to gross at minimum $9 million (JPY1 billion). Most of the rest goes to Warner, Shochiku, Gaga, Toei, Asmik Ace and Kadokawa.
Production budgets for films released by those leading distributors typically range from $1 million to $5 million, though the top end can be higher, especially for animation. Isao Takahata's 2013 film “The Tale of the Princess Kaguya” cost an estimated $46 million (JPY5 billion).
That then leaves the indies living on fumes. And, accordingly, they squeeze their production costs as close to zero as possible. While attacking Ueda, Fukada confessed to themselves having a “criminal record” of making low-budget films that “take advantage of the cast and crew's love of cinema.”
Ueda is unlikely to greatly profit from their triumph, save in more festival invitations and offers to make more films. As Fukada noted, Japanese directors usually only get a fee for their labors. No back-end participation. But it's still better than the position of their cast, who paid for the privilege of starring in a hit.
Jakarta: Defending champion Kidambi Srikanth's campaign ended with a narrow opening-round loss but Olympic silver medallist PV Sindhu eked out a thrilling win to progress to the women's singles pre-quarterfinals of the $ 1,250,000 Indonesia Open BWF World Tour Super 1000 tournament.
Former World No 1 Srikanth suffered their second successive loss to in-form Japanese Kento Momota, ranked 11th, in two weeks. The Indian lost 21-12 14-21 15-21 in the opening match that lasted exactly an hour at the Istora Gelora Bung Karno.
Momota had ended Srikanth's campaign at Malaysia Open last week and even though the Indian failed to avenge the loss, it was a far superior performance by the 25-year-old fourth seed.
Overall, it was Srikanth's seventh loss to the former World no 2 Momota, who has been in impressive form since coming back from a one-year ban due to illegal gambling.
However, Sindhu brought some smiles back in the Indian camp after seeing off Thailand's Pornpawee Chochuwong 21-15 19-21 21-13, setting up a clash with Japan's Aya Ohori on the eve of their 23rd birthday tomorrow.
Earlier, young Vaishnavi Reddy Jakka went down 12-21 10-21 to Denmark's Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt.
The men's doubles a pair of Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy stretched the world no 2 Chinese pair of Liu Cheng and Zhang Nan to three games before surrendering 21-15 15-21 17-21 to the third seeded combo.
In mixed doubles, Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy lost 12-21 14-21 to fourth seeded pair of Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong of China.
In the women's singles match, Sindhu was asked some serious questions by the 20-year-old Pornpawee, as they grabbed a slender 11-10 lead at the first interval.
The Indian seemed to struggle with their timing initially but two cross court smash and a misjudgement at backline by their opponent helped Sindhu to lead 14-13.
Sindhu showed great defence and seemed to have stepped up their pace as they soon moved to 19-14 and brought up five game point chances after attacking their opponent's backhand. A disguised shot ended the opening game in Sindhu's favour.
Sindhu seemed to struggle with the length of their strokes as they hit long and short to allow Pornpawee control the second game early on. The Thai girl moved to a 7-2 lead but Sindhu recovered well to first claw back at 10-10 with six straight points and then entered the interval with a one-point advantage when the Thai hit the net.
Pornpawee turned the table by making it 15-13 before moving to 19-16 when Sindhu found the net. But the Thai blew the advantage as the Indian gained three straight points, including a good-looking smash, to claw back at 19-19.
A superb rally ensued next, which left Sindhu sprawled on the court as it was game point advantage for Pornpawee. The Indian then hit the net and the Thai shuttler was back in the contest.
The duo split the initial 10 points in the decider before Sindhu managed to open up a 8-5 lead. The Indian held a four-point advantage after they unleashed a straight smash to enter the breather.
Sindhu continued to use their experience to outwit the Thai shuttler and won a net duel to make it 18-11. Two wide shots and it was the eight match points for Sindhu. Pornpawee saved one before Sindhu unleashed another smash to seal the contest.
Earlier, Srikanth, who was beaten in straight games by Momota in Kuala Lumpur last week, came out with all guns blazing and moved to a 19-10 lead and then grabbed 10 game points with a smash. Momota saved two game points before hitting the net as Srikanth earned the bragging rights.
In the second game, Momota moved to a 3-0 lead early on before a patient Srikanth clawed back at 5-5 with a superb stroke at the net. Despite some stiff resistance from the Indian, the left-handed Japanese managed to enter the break with a slender 11-9 lead after producing a powerful smash on their opponent's backhand.
A few mistimed strokes from Srikanth and the game slipped away as they lagged 11-17 before Momota held seven game points and roared back into the contest when Srikanth again found the net.
In the decider, Momota produced some razor-sharp returns to move to a 8-5 lead. A brilliant adjustment at the net gave Momota another point as they moved to a 11-6 lead.
After the breather, Srikanth cut down the deficit to 10-12 and then 14-16. But Momota was unstoppable as they soon grabbed five match points and converted it without further ado.
RIYADH (Reuters) - Prominent Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor has been sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined 1 million AED ($272,000) on charges of criticising the United Arab Emirates government on social media, The National newspaper reported late on Wednesday.
A trade and tourism hub, the UAE is an absolute monarchy that tolerates little public criticism of its ruling system and has prosecuted Mansoor and other pro-democracy activists for what it called insulting the country's leaders.
Mansoor was among five activists convicted of those charges in 2011 amid the “Arab Spring” protests calling for reform in other Arab states.
Mansoor, an electrical engineer and poet, was arrested in March 2017 and accused of promoting a sectarian and hate-incited agenda. The court cleared them of terrorist-related charges, according to The National.
Rights groups have called for Mansoor's release, calling their detention a violation of freedom of expression and opinion.

What's The Grind Line? Apart from the once-famous line of Kris Draper, Kirk Maltby, and either Joe Kocur or Darren McCarty, The Grind Line is also The Hockey Writers' weekly column about the Detroit Red Wings. Jacob Messing, Griffin Schroeder, and Tony Wolak are the muckers who make up THW's forechecking unit and sound off on Red Wings topics.
Whether general manager Ken Holland returns to the team or not, the Detroit Red Wings have a lot on their offseason checklist with a bulk of draft picks, handful of free agents to re-sign and a few trades likely in the works.
Right now, the organization looks like an all-you-can-eat buffet on one plate. Dylan Larkin, Anthony Mantha, Andreas Athanasiou, Tyler Bertuzzi and Martin Frk are all restricted free agents (RFA) this summer. Mike Green, who is rumored to come back, is a pending unrestricted free agent.
With little cap space, there are a lot of questions to be answered. It likely means Holland will look to move other contracts to fit in the youth, but with a plethora of no-trade clauses, it's easier said than done. Who could be on the outside looking in?

Jacob Messing: Martin Frk
A second-round pick in 2012, Frk took the long way to the NHL as they bounced between the ECHL and American Hockey League (AHL). The 24-year-old earned a spot out of camp in Andreas Athanasiou's absence and has been in the lineup with moderate regularity this season, as they own 11 goals and 22 points through 58 games.
A wicked, yet inaccurate, shot has helped them net five power-play goals, but a lack of defensive awareness (minus-13) and rough skating has kept them in a reserved, fourth-line role. It's relatively easy to see them as a slightly more effective Teemu Pulkkinen.
The major difference is Frk's 6-foot-1 frame and overall greater willingness to use their body and not shy away from contact. Pulkkinen, an elite AHL producer, yet poor NHL contributor, was claimed by Minnesota off waivers, later traded to Arizona and then taken by Vegas in the expansion draft. Teams were still interested in what they had to offer.
Frk offers more and at the young age of 24. He's been able to back up their booming, right-handed shot with other qualities. As a pending RFA, they could be moved for future considerations or a mid-to-late round draft pick. Cutting down the list of RFAs would go a long way this summer.
Another team would be willing to take a chance on them at a price they get to negotiate and with prospects knocking on the door, the extra cap space (albeit little) and roster spot could go to better use.

Tony Wolak: Trevor Daley
If Holland or another general manager decides to accelerate the rebuild this summer with a few more trades, Trevor Daley could net the Red Wings a nice return. While the defense was probably Detroit's weakest point this season, Daley was the best blue-liner and has a coveted skill set.
The veteran defenseman likes to join the rush, plays the right side, and doesn't try to be too fancy exiting their own zone. Daley's nine goals—eight of which at even-strength—ranks first on the Red Wings and tied for 24th in the NHL – one more than Ottawa's Erik Karlsson in as many games.
With a cap hit of only $3,166,667, Daley's contract is the most palatable among Detroit's veteran defenders. He's inked through the next two seasons and, with the upper cap limit expected to rise over the next couple of years, should be playing to their percentage-of-salary-cap contract value through its expiration. Unless other trades are made, Detroit would also have the ability to retain salary of Daley was dealt. In return, the Red Wings could expect a third-round draft choice, possibly with some games played and team performance conditions.
Daley does provide value on and off the ice for the young Red Wings. Considering Henrik Zetterberg's recent comments about their uninspired, “poke-and-hope” efforts, having the veteran defenseman around to guide the likes of Dennis Cholowski, Joe Hicketts, Filip Hronek, and other prospects may be in Detroit's best interest. However, blueliners would need to be moved to allow those up-and-coming players adequate ice time and Daley is the most appetizing for trade partners.
Griffin Schroeder: Nick Jensen
With a restructuring of the defense core on the horizon, Jensen doesn't seem like he's a candidate to stick around for the long haul. At 27 years old, their ceiling as an NHL player is more or less known and they don't bring anything different from the rest of the Wings' blue line brigade.
However, this doesn't make them necessarily useless to the rest of the league.
As the tired cliché goes, there is no such thing as having too much depth on the blue line. The St. Paul native fits the bottom-pairing role to a tee and routinely rotates in Detroit's top-four by default due to the Wings' lack of riches in terms of rear guards. This indirectly has allowed them to showcase for a depth role on an interested squad.
They only have 13 points this season (all assists), but has been able to stay on the positive side puck possession-wise. They actually lead the team in Corsi-against-per-60 minutes (51.23%) and is second to Niklas Kronwall in even-strength shot suppression (29.25 shots-against-per-60).
The former fifth-round pick can also charge up the ice with the puck and has made that fact evident in recent weeks starting rushes all by himself. With the league getting faster, the bottom-pairing defenseman has shifted from the traditional bruiser to a skater that can move the puck and extend the team's attack. In this, Jensen provides value.

 They are not the strongest weighing in at 6'0” and 194 pounds, which can lead to them getting out-muscled behind the net by fore-checkers. However, they will likely have more help and structure on a contender that could plug them in against weaker competition.
The Wings simply will not have much use for Jensen now that Cholowski, Hicketts, Hronek, Vili Saarijarvi and another potentially promising defensive prospect from this year's draft are gunning for the roster in the coming years.
With another year of control on an ultra-friendly $812,500 deal, the Wings should shop around and see what they can get for their homegrown defender as an under-the-radar trade chip.
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Top United Nations officials warned the Security Council on Monday that its sanctions on North Korea over the country's nuclear and missile programs may be harming the delivery of humanitarian aid to the impoverished, isolated Asian state. The 15-member Security Council held its fourth annual meeting on human rights abuses in North Korea, despite objections by China, who said it was not the right forum and warned the move could further escalate tensions in the region. U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein said U.N. agencies and aid groups were “literally a life-line” for some 13 million vulnerable North Koreans, “but sanctions may be adversely affecting this essential help.” Zeid and deputy U.N. political affairs chief Miroslav Jenca said aid groups were facing difficulties accessing international banking channels, transporting goods into the North Korea, and rising fuel prices hindering delivery of aid. In an Oct. 27 letter to the council sanctions committee on North Korea, seen by Reuters, the top U.N. official in Pyongyang, Tapan Mishra, also said there were customs problems. “Crucial relief items, including medical equipment and drugs, have been held up for months despite being equipped with the required paperwork affirming that they are not on the list of sanctioned items,” Mishra wrote. Zeid asked the Security Council on Monday to assess the impact of the sanctions on human rights and take action “to minimize their adverse humanitarian consequences.” In a statement on Friday, the council sanctions committee reiterated that the nine sanctions resolutions adopted since 2006 “are not intended to have adverse humanitarian consequences for the civilian population” of North Korea. ‘COUNTERPRODUCTIVE' North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights abuses and blames sanctions for the humanitarian situation. The North Korean U.N. mission condemned Monday's meeting “as a desperate act of the hostile forces which lose the political and military confrontation with the DPRK (North Korea) that has openly risen to the position of nuclear weapon state.” Japan's U.N. Ambassador Koro Bessho told reporters on Monday: “The humanitarian situation and human rights situation in North Korea is very dire and that's because of the authorities.” For the fourth time, China unsuccessfully tried to stop the public meeting by calling a procedural vote. A minimum of nine votes are needed to win such a vote and China, Russia, the United States, Britain and France cannot wield their vetoes. Ten members voted in favour of the meeting, China, Russia and Bolivia voted against, and Egypt and Ethiopia abstained. “Council members and relevant parties should engage themselves with finding ways to ease tensions on the Peninsula. They should avoid mutual provocation and words or actions that might further escalate the situation,” China's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Wu Haitao told the council. They said the discussion of human rights in North Korea was counterproductive. “The systematic human rights violations and abuses of the North Korean government are more than the cause of its people's suffering. They are a means to a single end: Keeping the Kim Jong-un regime in power,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council. The Security Council is due to hold a ministerial meeting on North Korea's nuclear and missiles programs on Friday.

ISLAMABAD-Interest payment had consumed major chunk of the government's revenue, as it paid Rs647.4 billion on debt service cost during first half of the ongoing financial year, which is far higher than spending on country's defence and development.
The federal government had paid Rs587.66 billion as servicing on domestic debt and Rs59.8 billion on foreign loans during July-December of the year 2016-17, according to the official documents of the Ministry of Finance. The government had earmarked Rs1,360 billion in annual budget for paying interest on domestic as well as foreign loans during fiscal year starting from July 2016 to June 2017.
Debt payment always remained on top in consuming budget among three Ds (debt servicing, defence and development). Debt payment is rapidly increasing every year, as the successive governments had taken massive loans from the international financial institutions as well as from local banks. Pakistan's total external debt and liabilities ballooned to $74.6 billion by the end of September 2016. The break-up shows that the external debt rose to $58.7 billion. The total public debt stood at Rs20.6 trillion by the end of September 2016, an increase of Rs3.15 trillion since June 2015.
Meanwhile, the government had spent Rs336.3 billion on defence of the country, which is 39 percent of the annual defence budget of Rs860.2 billion. The lowest spending among three Ds were on federal development, which remained at 198.27 billion during July-December period of the ongoing financial year. Meanwhile, provincial governments had spent Rs247.4 billion on the development projects.
Pakistan's budget deficit had reached to Rs799.1 billion (2.4 percent of the GDP) during first half of the year 2016-17 due to massive expenditures and lower tax collection. The country's expenditures were recorded at Rs2,789.7 billion as compared to revenues of Rs1,990.6 billion, taking the deficit to Rs799.1 billion.
The government might struggle to restrict the budget deficit at 3.8 percent of the GDP (Rs1.276 trillion) during current fiscal year due to missing of tax as well as non-tax collection target. The tax collection shortfall of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had risen to Rs140 billion during seven months (July to January) of the ongoing financial year. Similarly, in non-tax collection, the government had received coalition support fund (CSF).
The documents showed that the government spent Rs131.3 billion on pension payments, Rs51.4 billion on public order and safety affairs, Rs35.3 billion on education, Rs6.1 billion on health and Rs4.6 billion on recreation, culture and religion.
Of the total revenues of Rs1,990.6 billion, the government has collected around Rs249.4 billion as non-tax revenues during the first half of the present fiscal year. In non-tax revenues, the government collected Rs8.9 million as markup on public sector entities, Rs12.2 billion as dividend, Rs87.79 billion as profit of State Bank of Pakistan, Rs4.6 billion as defence, Rs7.1 billion as passport fee and Rs3.6 billion as discount remained on crude oil, Rs24.4 billion as royalties on gas and oil, Rs514 million as windfall levy against crude oil and Rs99.7 billion through other sources.
The four provincial governments recorded budget surplus of Rs42.2 billion during July-December of the current fiscal year as their expenditures remained at Rs1022 billion as compared to the revenues of Rs1064.2 billion.

WASHINGTON - Two US senators have requested details on President Donald Trump's smartphone security, saying they could jeopardize national secrets if they are still using their old handset, as some reports say. "Did Trump receive a secured, encrypted smartphone for their personal use on or before Jan. 20? If so, is they using it?," said a tweet Tuesday by Senator Tom Carper, who along with fellow Democrat Claire McCaskill released a letter to the administration requesting information on the president's device. "Trump should be well aware by now of the appropriate and necessary protocol to safeguard our nation's secrets." The letter from the two lawmakers, dated February 9, was sent to Defense Secretary James Mattis along with Homeland Security chief John Kelly and the National Security Agency director Michael Rogers. The senators released the letter late Monday. The lawmakers said they were concerned by reports that Trump was still using an Android device that may be several years old for their frequent personal Twitter messages.
"While it is important for the president to have the ability to communicate electronically, it is equally important that they do so in a manner that is secure and that ensures the preservation of presidential records," the letter said.
"The national security risks of compromising a smartphone used by a senior government official, such as the president of the United States, are considerable."
The New York Times reported last month that while Trump had received a new, secure device after their inauguration, they still relied on their older device despite protests from aides.
That report prompted a flurry of comments from security experts who argued that the president would be inviting danger by using their old personal phone.
Trump's smartphone "would probably be the most widely prized device on the internet for hackers - and top of the target list for intelligence agencies around the world," said independent security researcher Graham Cluley in a blog post Tuesday.
Last month, Nicholas Weaver of the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California, warned that "Trump's continued use of a dangerously insecure, out-of-date Android device should cause real panic."
Writing on the Lawfare blog, Weaver noted that hackers could gain access to the phone's location as well as its microphone and camera and that "the working assumption should be that Trump's phone is compromised by at least one - probably multiple - hostile foreign intelligence services and is actively being exploited."
Some critics went further to note the possibility of an Objectivist reading of Bird's movie: Here was a story, after all, about literally superhuman individuals being sapped of their potential by the unremarkable, untalented masses. The suggestion that Bird was some sort of closet Ayn Rand disciple eventually calcified into received wisdom, though I've never had much use for it myself. Like the director's other Pixar triumph, “Ratatouille” (2007), “The Incredibles” may allow that some individuals are innately gifted, but it also insists that those gifts, far from being allowed to flourish at any cost, must be tempered and nurtured through creativity, humility and public service.

In decrying their failed nomination of Conservative MP Rachel Harder than Chair of the Status of Women Committee, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer is confusing freedom of expression with the basic qualifications required for any MP holding such a Parliamentary position. In the process they have revealed their disregard for the Committee and women's rights.
Canadian law recognizes that human life begins at birth. In its 1988 decision in R v. Morgentaler, the Supreme Court of Canada struck down Criminal Code restrictions on access to abortion because they violated women's rights to life, liberty and security of the person under section 7 of the Charter. Since that time, an increasing number of Canadians have come to view abortion as matter for a woman themselves to decide. Indeed, the PEI government recently acknowledged that the lack of abortion services on the Island was sex discriminatory and had to be addressed.
In contrast to the majority of Canadians, Scheer believes that life begins at conception and that any attempt to end such life is wrong. Mr. Scheer is entitled to voice their opinion but when they and other anti-choice parliamentarians argue that their religious beliefs or moral values should dictate whether or not all women in Canada have access to abortion, that's a problem.
Granting legal status to the fetus or recriminalizing abortion services would violate the freedom of conscience rights of those who do not share Scheer and Harder's religious beliefs or moral values. More significantly, however, the Criminal Code changes demanded by Harder and other anti-abortion MPs, would violate the life, liberty, security of the person of all women in Canada.
Sheer, Harder, and anti-choice organizations like Campaign Life are free to express their views around abortion, including in Parliament and before Parliamentary Committees. Nevertheless, as the Liberal and NDP members of the Committee pointed out in appointing Conservative MP Karen Vecchio instead, Harder's views on women's reproductive autonomy and choice provide a clear indication that Harder lacks the basic qualifications necessary to be a member, let alone the Chair, of the Status of Women Committee.
Canadians reasonably expect the Chair of the Access to Information Committee to believe that access to government information is important; the Chair of the Justice and Human Rights Committee to support human rights and the rule of law; and the Chair of the Environment Committee to believe in sustainable development and the risks of climate change. It is for this reason that former Conservative Party leader Rona Ambrose's decision to remove Senator Lynn Beyak from the Senate's Aboriginal Peoples Committee was universally applauded. Senator Beyak does indeed have the freedom to try to defend residential schools. But in doing so, they revealed that they were unqualified to sit on the Senate Committee engaged in the challenging task of transforming relationships with Indigenous Peoples in Canada based on recognition, rights and respect.
Likewise, a substantive understanding of, and wholehearted support for the freedom of conscience, security of the person, and equality rights of all women in Canada — starting with their reproductive rights — are a minimum qualification for the Chair of the Status of Women Committee.
Whether or not Harder was appointed Chair of the Committee was not freedom of expression issue. And, contrary to what Scheer would have Canadians believe, rejecting Harder's nomination is not an attempt to suppress freedom of expression. The role of the Status of Women Committee — and indeed the constitutional obligation of Parliament and the Government of Canada as a whole — is to protect and promote the equality rights of all women and girls in Canada not just the rights of those who share Scheer and Harder's religious beliefs.
Denying access to a health care service that only women require is clear sex discrimination. The failure to grasp this fact showed not only that Harder was unqualified to chair the Status of Women Committee, but that Scheer didn't care.

To gauge the importance to Republicans of Tuesday's special election for a vacant House seat in the Atlanta suburbs, look no further than President Trump's Twitter feed.
“The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal [sic] race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!” the president declared Monday. They followed up with three additional tweets on Tuesday morning exhorting Republicans to vote.
Trump's ire toward Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff was not necessarily accurate — they haven't run as a liberal Democrat and hasn't espoused raising taxes or the other views the president attached to him. But the fact that Trump has gotten involved points to the concern the White House and the GOP have about the race.
Democrats have coalesced around Ossoff and — if polls are accurate — have brought them close to the edge of winning the seat outright in Tuesday's all-candidates primary by earning over 50% of the vote.
That would flip the seat, a longtime Republican stronghold held until recently by Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, from Republican to Democrat. By itself, it wouldn't greatly reduce the GOP advantage in the House, but it would put Democrats on the offensive — and Republicans on defense — as the 2018 congressional contests near.
Even the scenario that polls suggest is more likely, in which Ossoff falls just short of a majority, setting in motion a runoff election on June 20 between the top two finishers, underscores how Trump's election has scrambled the political predilections of districts like Georgia's 6th.
Price won this district by more than 23 percentage points in November. Trump, however, eked out just a 1.5-percentage-point victory, not only 20 points fewer than Price, but also far behind the 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
That means the district was a clear marker for one of the less-noticed demographic shifts in the presidential contest.
Much attention has been lavished on Trump's strong showing in exurban and rural areas across the country, where once solidly Democratic and blue-collar voters sided with the Republican nominee.
While that was enough to secure their electoral college victory, it came at a price: turning moderate suburban districts like Georgia's 6th more Democratic than they previously had been.
Tuesday's election will test whether the Trump effect poses a threat to Republicans beyond himself, even to those running the sort of conventional GOP campaigns seen in the special-election race.
Republicans are counting on the district reverting to its normal behavior — if not on Tuesday, when its vote is split among multiple candidates, then in a runoff.
The presidential contest “was an outcome driven almost solely by the particular personalities involved,” said longtime Republican pollster Whit Ayres, who is working for the GOP candidate that most polls had in second place, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel. “A more traditional Republican running a more traditional Republican campaign should reset the outcome.”
They added an important caveat, however: “Who knows what the impact will be of a highly energized Democratic base?”
Ossoff has been the unlikely beneficiary of that high energy. A 30-year-old former congressional aide and filmmaker, they have mined Democratic distaste for Trump nationally into a lavish campaign, raising more than $8 million by the last accounting — a figure that vaulted the first-time candidate into the ranks of Congress' best fundraisers and financed a frenzy of ads and campaign activity.
The vast majority of Ossoff's money has come from outside the district, a factor that has been used as a predictable sledgehammer by Republicans, who have also hit Ossoff on their youth and a prior job as a filmmaker for the cable channel Al Jazeera.
In contrast to Trump's characterization of them in their tweet, Ossoff has gone out of their way to present themselves as anything but a flamethrower, lest they reinforce the district's Republican bent.
“Folks here are excited now for fresh leadership presenting a substantive message about local economic development and talking about core values,” they offered blandly in a recent interview. “They are tired of partisan politics.”
Yet partisan politics and Democratic rage define today's political environment, which has been clear in the special elections made necessary by Trump appointments to senior positions in their administration.
Last week, Democrat James Thompson finished less than 7 percentage points behind Republican Ron Estes in the special election for Kansas' 4th Congressional District, one far more red than Georgia's contested district. Trump had won the Kansas seat by 27 percentage points.
The gap between Trump's showing and Estes' finish fanned Democratic hopes that a groundswell of fervor could prove more successful in more closely contested districts, such as the one in Georgia.
That has raised the stakes dramatically for Democrats: The Kansas race was not winnable in almost anyone's estimation, but the Georgia seat is seen as a toss-up.
Winning could mean a continued invigoration of Democratic activists, a continued boom in donations and, most importantly, serve to encourage potential Democratic candidates in districts seen as unwinnable just a few months ago.
A Democratic loss could restore confidence among Republicans, suggest an effective course to blunt Trump-inspired anger in future races and stall any sense of Democratic momentum leading into two additional special House contests in May, and the 2018 elections.
The party out of power typically tries to project midterm elections as national referendums on the party in power — and Trump's presidency has given Democrats ammunition to spare in their efforts this spring.
A survey released Monday by the Pew Research Center offered a downcast assessment for Republicans.
Trump's job approval rating stood at 39%; 54% of Americans disapproved of how he's handled the presidency. In polls dating back to the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan, no president has done worse than 29% disapproval, Pew researchers said.
They've been calling out to hungry stomachs in Richmond for almost five decades.
The McDonald's restaurant on No. 3 Road is home to the first golden arches planted outside of the United States.
“It's something that we consider a landmark here in Richmond and it reminds us of yesteryear,” said Richmond city councillor and historian Bill McNulty.
In June 1967, business person George Tidball brought the McDonald's chain to Canada after buying Western Canada rights from the American corporation for a $50,000 down payment. Tidball got their inspiration while on a road trip to California, where they visited the McDonald's headquarters.
“Well they came back here and brought in the first McDonald's to Richmond and this was the first place of the 19 cent hamburger,” said McNulty.
The No. 3 Road location began as just a hamburger stand. Now, as it approaches its 50th anniversary, McDonald's wants to demolish the original restaurant and build a new one with a double drive-through at the same location. There was concern the historic golden arches might fall but the city of Richmond is working with the restaurant chain to ensure the original sign is preserved for its heritage value.
“Staff has been working with McDonald's to retain the iconic ‘golden arches' as an urban memory and commemoration of the long-standing presence of McDonald's in the city centre. The applicant has agreed to the retention of the existing McDonald's “golden arches” free standing sign rather than installing new signage. The sign will be refurbished and relocated slightly within the proposed landscape border along the sidewalk to open up clear sight lines to the new building,” states a report to the city of Richmond's Development Permit Panel.
Customers at Canada's first McDonald's restaurant say they would hate to see the golden arches' sign disappear. “It's been around for so long I don't know. I would miss it. It's a heritage place here,” said one female customer.
“It's really good to keep the sign it's very meaningful,” added another customer.
“It's iconic, it's historic, it's the first one in Canada. It's almost a national treasure,” said McNulty.
McDonald's is planning a 50th anniversary celebration in Richmond in the summer of 2017.
Michael Moore teases 'secret project' aimed at Donald Trump, Roseanne Burr: 'They will rue the day they knew me'
Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore teased a “secret” documentary involving Donald Trump and Roseanne Barr on Wednesday. They shared on Twitter a throwback clip of them as a guest alongside Trump on The Roseanne Show, Barr's talk show in the late 90s.
The tweet was accompanied by the caption: “I know Roseanne. And I know Trump. And they are about to rue the day they knew me...”
I know Roseanne. And I know Trump. And they are about to rue the day they knew me... pic.twitter.com/vW81Gq7s1i — Michael Moore (@MMFlint) May 30, 2018
In the video, the then-New York real estate mogul is seen praising the Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker's 1989 film, Roger & Me, about the consequences of GM CEO Roger Smith's downsizing efforts on Moore's hometown of Flint, Michigan.

“It was terrific, I tell you. I loved what they did,” Trump tells Moore in the segment. “If I was Roger, I wouldn't have liked it. But I enjoyed it.”
“I hope they never does one on me,” Trump added.
But, going by the banner on Moore's website, Trump should be concerned. A message posted on the site reads: “I've been working on a secret project for the last few months.”

New Delhi: India's main opposition Congress party on Monday elevated Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the country's most fabled political dynasty, as its president, preparing to challenge the dominance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of national polls in 2019.
In a long-awaited move, Gandhi, the great-grandson of India's founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was elected unopposed to head the party. They will take the reins from their mother Sonia, the party's longest-serving president who was elected in 1998.
Calling it a “historic occasion”, the Congress party said Gandhi would take charge as president on 16 December. Television broadcast images of party supporters celebrating and distributing sweets outside Congress offices in the capital, New Delhi, and the financial hub of Mumbai.
Gandhi's ascent coincides with state polls in Modi's western home state of Gujarat that are shaping as a test for the prime minister, who has been facing criticism for softening economic growth and poor implementation of a nationwide sales tax. The Congress hopes a round of state elections offers the party, and Gandhi, a shot at revival ahead of the next national elections, due in 2019.
Modi's depiction of Gandhi as an undeserving “prince” has helped sideline Gandhi since the last national election, during which time Congress has suffered some of its worst results in local elections.
The Nehru-Gandhi family has ruled the country for most of its 70 years since independence from Britain. Gandhi's father and grandmother were both prime ministers, and both assassinated.
Gandhi v. Modi
Following Congress' defeat in the 2014 polls, Gandhi struggled to convince voters, as well as many within their party, of their leadership skills. But senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said Gandhi was now ready for the next challenge.
“The entire country has lots of expectations from Rahul Gandhi,” Azad said. “Much before they were elected they have shown their mettle. They know their responsibility.”
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swiftly dismissed Gandhi's election, saying they had become president only on the basis of “dynastic principle”. “The new India is loath to (accept) dynastic principle and the family character of the Congress further diminishes its appeal,” BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao told Reuters.
Gandhi, until now a vice-president of Congress, is widely seen as a prime ministerial candidate if the party returns to power one day.
The 47-year-old has increasingly gone public in slamming Modi's governance since the last national polls, as they look to shed the reticent image that has for years been synonymous with their political dynasty.
But they have also faced political backlash. In 2015, for example, they took nearly two months of leave, prompting Modi's party to accuse them of “holidaying” while parliament was in session.
Modi still trumps Gandhi in popularity rankings, however. Nearly nine of 10 Indians have a favourable opinion of them and more than two-thirds are satisfied with the direction in which they are taking the country, a Pew survey found in November. Modi's favourable rating was 30 points more than Gandhi‘s, it showed.
Senators on Tuesday said that the White House seemed to have been caught unaware by the criticisms of Jackson, who had previously been best known for the glowing descriptions they offered of Trump's health during a briefing with reporters in January. At one point in that briefing, Jackson joked that had the 71-year-old Trump not suffered from a weakness for fast food, "he might live to be 200 years old."
The possibility
The hope
And the potential
Of the world I leave behind
I can see.
I met with a young child recently. When asking about their relationship with a grandparent I asked what they enjoyed doing with their grandparent. They said “hang out”. I told them that was nice, and I hoped my grandchildren would one day say that about me. They looked me dead in the eye and said “they won't”.
I am sure there is humor in there somewhere!

Detroit — Nine pitches. One strike.
That's not good enough to get it done — on any level of baseball.
That was Bruce Rondon's stat line on Sunday, walking the only two batters they faced in the eighth inning of the Tigers' 6-4 loss to the Minnesota Twins at Comerica Park.
After the game, Rondon was optioned to Triple-A Toledo, making room for Michael Fulmer, who will be activated before their start Monday at Texas.
Instead of potentially becoming the closer, Rondon is going back to the Mud Hens to work on just being more consistent in hitting the strike zone.
“(He needs to) go down and get consistent, just performance-wise,” Ausmus said.
The second batter Rondon faced, Chris Gimenez, was trying to sacrifice to get the runner to second base — but when Rondon was unable to throw strikes, the situation ballooned to two runners on with no outs.
In their last five outings, Rondon has given up three earned runs and six hits, for a 7.36 ERA, but their teammates are confident they can get their mojo back.
“I say short memory of struggle and long memory of successes,” catcher James McCann said. “At the end of the day, you have to work hard for it. There are going to be obstacles along the way.
“Everyone has had and will have their fair share of struggles over the course of their career. Hopefully for Bruce, I hope the struggles they are experiencing this time will become positive in the long run and they become better for it.”
It's the second trip to Toledo for Rondon this season, who had an opportunity to find a bigger role after Francisco Rodriguez was released earlier this season and Justin Wilson was dealt at the trade deadline.
Now, it's back to the drawing board.
“He knows their stuff is good and they have all the talent in the world,” pitcher Matthew Boyd said. “You have to go back and keep attacking and stay on the offensive.”
Shane Greene has moved into the closer's role — at least for the foreseeable future — and there's a void for the setup role in the eighth inning.
But Ausmus doesn't see that as a big hurdle — they'll fill it by committee for the time being.
“We'll just see who's pitching well and what the matchups are,” Ausmus said. “Somebody is going to have to step up.”
