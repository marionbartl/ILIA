When I hear cinnamon and challenge, I think of those people who try to eat a tablespoon of cinnamon within a minute. They make for funny Youtube videos =p
This week, I went for something very simple but still something I've never tried before, home-baked sweet potato chips!
I peeled and hand sliced 2 medium sweet potatoes (hand sliced means inconsistency, so some ended up “crispier” the what is shown above), then just tossed them in some olive oil, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg. Baked them while flipping them halfway through. A nice trick I read for a crisp chip, is to preheat the pan with the oven up to 500, then drop it down to 400 for the regular baking. I don't know if helped, since this was my first attempt, but they turned out delicious. A simple and healthy snack!

We want your candy. All of it. Yes, even the Smartees and the Bit O' Honey and the endless Tootsie Rolls that seem to litter the bottom of every Halloween bag after all the Reese's Cups and Snickers Bars have been gobbled down.
Okay, no, not literally. We here at Creative Commoners love our metaphors every bit as much as we love our candy. It's officially our Favorite Time of Year, when the leaves are drying up and making that raspy sound when the wind blows them across the pavement, when the chilly air smells of nature getting ready for its long nap, when the spirits are ready to come out and make mischief. It's when macabre and fake blood and catering to our inner-children or dressing up like Undead Snooki is in vogue. It's Halloween time, and if loving it is wrong, we don't wanna be right!
We always feel creatively inspired this time of year, and we don't think we're alone. So in that vein, we want all of your artistic expressions to that effect. Spooky stories, pictures, video, art, cooking… whatever you have, whatever you want to make or have made in the past for this most lovely of holidays, we want it.
Let's get down to the specifics:
WRITING
We're casting a wide net here. Fiction, essay, non-fiction. If it's in the Halloween theme and around 500 words or fewer, we'd love to have it. Maybe you had a scary supernatural event happen to you in real life that you'd like to share. Maybe a favorite childhood memory of Halloween. Maybe a chilling fictional ghost story. Whatever you have, send it to us!
But we're asking something extra this time. If possible, record yourself reading it and attach it to your email along with the story. We want to add as many voices as we can to this very special Halloween podcast! You can use your phone recording software or even the one that comes pre-installed on Windows or whatever operating system you use. If you want, you can even add in special effects! Send it to us in .wav or .mp3 for mat. Either way, we'd love to have your story told in your own voice.
If you can't do that, we're still happy to read it ourselves, but we want to give you the chance to do your work the proper justice. In case you didn't listen to our last Creative Challenge, we tend to flub the best lines from time to time.
PICTURES/ARTWORK/VIDEO/POTPOURRI
Got some super creepy pictures you took from the inside of an abandoned mental hospital? Maybe a particularly pernicious looking sunset? Or how about something that looks suspiciously like an apparition? A painting that people swear is haunted? Those sick looking severed finger cookies you made for your Halloween party? Or how about a particularly creative Halloween costume or house decoration?
We want it.
How about that amateur (non-porn) scary video you made? Send us the YouTube link. Or send us the video or recording of a boo-licious song you wrote and performed. We want our Compendium stuffed full of your creepiest delights. No, we can't exactly put it all on the recorded show, but you'll get full acknowledgments on the podcast, and it will grace our website.
There's going to be something for everyone with this Halloween Challenge, so we don't expect to have just a few entries. We want variety and volume. We want to celebrate our favorite holiday immersed in your creepy creative offerings!

Watch Dogs has proven to be quite ‘leaky' this week and we have seen some footage from the PS3 and PS4 version of the game. Unfortunately, most of this footage proved to be heavily compressed since the leak started with a Twitch Stream and was the only source of video. Finally, after a lot of waiting, we can appreciate this high quality video of the PS4 version, which is a good showcase of the graphics on the PS4.
You can take a look at this video below, or you can download it yourself(recommended) from the link here.

Ubisoft seems to have a lot of expectations from Watch Dogs as a new IP, and it has also set record for the most pre-ordered new IP from Ubisoft. If this sells well, we can expect to see the series continue in the future.
Watch Dogs is set to release on the PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One and PC on May 27th. It will be released on the Wii U at a later date this year.
What do you think about this new footage? Let us know in the comments below.
Sam: Any order of operations when it comes to construction? Anything you need to have as a primary focus?
Dan: The order of operations will be very important, but it's pretty complex and we haven't scheduled it yet. Everything is done in stages. As an example, for plumbing: everything that goes under the slab is done first, it is inspected, than the concrete is poured over it. Later, the plumbing in the walls is “roughed in” then the walls are built around it. Finally, the fixtures are hooked up before the finish work can be done to make everything look nice.
Everything is interconnected, so it's very important to pay attention during scheduling. There are so many moving parts that the plan will need to be constantly updated. Any decision has the potential to put the schedule back or cost us money. I'm really looking forward to this challenge, I should have plenty of chances to put my mechanical engineering background and problem-solving skills to good use.
I should also point out that this is my first major construction project, so I will be leaning heavily on my General Contractor (GC) and subcontractors for information and guidance. I have been really happy dealing with my GC, Michael Gais of Gais Construction. They have been very active throughout the planning stage, working with our architect to figure out a lot of details of the build.
Foo Fighters man plays drums on Washington trio's debut album
Dave Grohl has hooked up with new band RDGLDGRN, NME can confirm.
In an interview, which you can read in this week's issue of the magazine, the Washington trio said that Grohl recorded drums for their currently-untitled debut album at LA's Sound City Studios in 2012 – and they may tour with them later in the year.
Grohl met the band at the studio complex while they were working on their upcoming documentary about its history.
Speaking about Grohl's involvement in the project, the band said they “knocked out half our record like some kind of machine”, adding that it was “overwhelming” to work with such a legendary sticksman.
Head over to the NME Radar blog now to listen to the first new track to be aired from the sessions, ‘Million Fans'. Pick up this week's magazine to find out what the band had to say about their UK touring plans.
RDGLDGRN aren't the only band the Foo Fighters mainman will be drumming for this year – they are also set to get behind the kit for tracks on the new album by Queens Of The Stone Age.
They also recently drummed for metal band Ghost and debuted their all-star Sound City Players at Sundance Film Festival last weekend.
The timing of the new tensions in Donbass, provoked by the Kiev forces, is connected with the upcoming EU summit, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. They added that Kiev has breached the Minsk deal and Moscow is waiting for the OSCE's reaction.
"The violations are obvious and [Foreign] Minister [Sergey] Lavrov has already said that the representatives of the OSCE are to draw corresponding conclusions and to clearly identify who is responsible for these violations [in eastern Ukraine],” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists Thursday.
According to Peskov, the Kiev authorities are responsible for the recent escalation of the crisis in the troubled region.
“Donbass is being shelled. Self-defence forces can't shell their own territory,” they said.
Peskov said that the attempts to destabilize the situation and provoke the tensions can be clearly seen.
“These provocative actions are organized by Ukraine's military forces and we are concerned with that,” the Kremlin spokesperson added.
Moscow believes that the timing of the new tensions is connected with the upcoming EU summit, which is to take place in Brussels on June 25-26.
"Yes, indeed, in the past Kiev had already heated up tensions amid some large international events. This is the case, and now we are seriously concerned about the next repetition of such activity,” Peskov said.
At the summit, the European Union is looking to extend its broad economic sanctions against Moscow over Ukraine crisis until January 2016, according to several senior officials and diplomats, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Apart from the EU summit, there will also be a G7 summit on June 7-8 hosted by Germany at the Elmau castle near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, in Bavaria.
In 2014, the G7 leaders refused to participate in the G8 summit in Sochi after Crimea reunited with Russia last year following a referendum that was consistent with international law and the UN Charter.
'Plumes of smoke everywhere': RT crew witnesses Donetsk shelling aftermath (DRONE VIDEO) http://t.co/RNCu8iFj7upic.twitter.com/0F3nquxicD — RT (@RT_com) June 3, 2015
In April, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that G7 leaders are not yet ready to welcome Russia back at the discussion table.
Still calling it an “annexation” Steinmeier said the G7 states “could not simply act as if nothing had happened and carry on with business as usual.”
Eduard Basurin, spokesperson for the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) Defense Ministry, said that the special OSCE mission is planning to visit those injured in Wednesday's shelling in the city of Donetsk.
Kiev forces shelled the eastern Ukrainian city on Wednesday, mostly the southwest Petrovsky and Kirovsky districts, killing at least six people and injuring 90 others. The bombardment also caused a great deal of destruction at the city's Sokol market, where several rows of shops were burned down.
The RT crew, who were among the first reporters at the scene, recorded dramatic footage of the shelling's aftermath.
According to Basurin, the shelling was “chaotic, but targeted the private sector where people live.”
“According to preliminary information, Ukrainian troops opened artillery fire from a 152 mm gun. It is probably a 2A36 Giatsint-B [field] gun,” they added.
However, US State Department spokesperson Marie Harf refused to directly acknowledge that the Kiev authorities are violating the Minsk peace agreements, turning a blind eye to daily OSCE reports that equally implicate the government and the rebel forces.
READ MORE: US ignores OSCE data, blames ‘majority' of Ukraine truce violations on rebels
Harf insisted Wednesday that the “majority of violations” have been committed by rebel forces and not Kiev's troops.
“Everything we're getting from the OSCE and other sources of information indicates that a vast majority, as my colleague said, are from the Russian-separatist combined forces,” Harf said in reply to a question from RT's Gayane Chichakyan.
The Minsk-2 peace agreement was struck in February 2015 by Kiev and the eastern rebels and brokered by Russia, Germany and France in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. It provided for the steps intended to bring peace to war-torn eastern Ukraine, including a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline and constitutional reform decentralizing power.
The current escalation of violence led to an increase in fighting, which saw over 6,000 killed since April 2014.
On Wednesday, the General Staff of Ukraine said that Kiev's forces were using heavy artillery that had previously been withdrawn from the frontline under February's Minsk peace deal.
“In order to stop the enemy's offensive and to avoid casualties among the troops, the Ukrainian military command – after warning all of its international partners – was forced to use artillery, which was in the rear areas defined by the Minsk agreements,” the General Staff's press service said, as cited by RIA Novosti news agency.
Stephen Colbert's political action committee has enough cash to play jokes and pull pranks through the presidential campaign, but for now the comedian is mum on how they plan to spend that money.
Colbert's Super PAC, Americans for A Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow has $794,000 cash-on-hand sitting untouched in its coffers, according to March documents filed with the Federal Election Commission, making it wealthier than some PAC's intended to back (legitimate!) presidential candidates
The PAC raised just $44,000 in March, but spent only $28,000, mostly on Internet bills and legal fees. Though the March haul is paltry, the committee is sitting on a significant sum.
By contrast, as Politico first reported, Take Endorse Liberty, a PAC dedicated to supporting Ron Paul's candidacy has just $54,000 in the bank.
Take Endorse Liberty, initially bankrolled with a $1.7 million donation from PayPal founder Peter Thiel, raised just $13,000 in March.
Colbert's PAC, however, was significantly outspent by big-name organizers. Winning Our Future, the pro-Gingrich PAC mostly bankrolled by Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson and their family received $5 million in March alone.
The pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action has $5 million cash-on-hand, and Restore Our Future, the group backing Mitt Romney has $16.5 million in the kitty.
Colbert has no millionaire backer behind their Super PAC. They have raised funds through appeals to viewers on their popular Comedy Central show "The Colbert Report." Through their website, Colbert sells a "Super Fun PAC" for $99, which includes a wrench, tube socks, and a sign that reads "If the super PAC is caucusing, don't bother knockusing!"
Super PACs are a new form of political action organization freed of the campaign finance rules that limit donations to a candidate directly. Colbert created the PAC as parody, to highlight the sometime shadowy world of political giving.
Colbert's Comedy Central spokesperson referred questions about the PAC to their personal publicist, who did not immediately respond.
æternity Dev-Log: 17–02
Change log summarizing current development of the æternity blockchain up until mid of July.
æternity Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 21, 2017
As of the beginning of May 2017, Zack Hess, our tech lead, was ready with the implementation of essential parts of the blockchain. These include;
Handling accounts and keys. Exchanging p2p peers. Syncing blocks. Signing, bundling transactions and mining blocks. Channels, Oracles, Governance. Exposing HTTP interface for all transactions: accounts, channels, payments. Persistence layer. Trie itself and wrapper covering: accounts, channels, existence, oracles and governance. Important use cases that require optimized blockchain design like lightning payment. All of that supported by initial version of documentation and tests.
Around that time the team started growing! We brought many years experience in Erlang, the technology that is powering the æternity blockchain, together with all the necessary skills to build reliable, industrial-grade chain.
The blockchain is now regular OTP app and rebar3 manages deployment. We optimize configuration and instrumentation of the code. We have outside help to proof correctness and optimize our implementation of trie (detailed review is coming!). Our integration tests are now migrated to nose python framework. We introduced multiple node test deployments to test lightning payments. All of above managed from Makefile and we try to go along the best coding practices. We are re-doing HTTP API's to talk in more verbose json objects and we back it up with swagger with all the goodies that swagger brings. We slowly optimize and refactor internal services for syncing, transactions. We got great community input and contributions around syncing blocks between nodes.
What is up next?
We want to stabilize test framework and get CI running for each PR.
Finish re-factoring of the HTTP interface.
Write lite-node for browsers.
Introduce Markets support in blockchain code.
Please feel free to join the discussion on Slack and/or reach out to Michal to let them know if you are willing to contribute! Joining our Slack is currently by invite only. Get in touch with someone from the team to get an invite.
Michal, Architect.
What to Israel Hernandez-Bandera was "an act of barbarism" and an "assassination of a young artist and photographer" was, to many police departments nationwide, a common response to a mounting threat.
On Tuesday, Mr. Hernandez-Bandera's son, Israel Hernandez-Llach, died after being shot by Taser stun gun. According to police accounts, Mr. Hernandez-Llach was spray-painting an abandoned McDonald's and ran away when confronted, failing to heed officers' commands.
At a time when police departments say offenders are becoming more violent and officer injuries are on the rise, Tasers have become an invaluable tool, allowing officers to subdue suspects without deadly force. But critics say police have become too enamored of them, and they point to the incident in Miami Beach, Fla., as evidence that the use of electroshock weapons is too often replacing caution and common sense.
Most police departments do not publish data on Taser incidents, as they do on incidents that involve firearms. But statistics and police statements suggest Taser use is on the rise. A 2012 study by The Chicago Tribune found that Chicago police were involved in 197 Taser incidents in 2009. By 2011, the department was on a pace to hit 857 incidents.
In eight other cities across Illinois, the story was similar, with Taser use doubling overt the same time period. In Austin, Texas, police Taser use also doubled between 2009 and 2011, according to a 2012 Austin American-Statesman report.
The trend is "societal," Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo told the paper. "Lots of economic frustrations, lack of respect for authority. It's a byproduct of what is happening in our country."
In laying out its policy on Tasers, police in the small town of Norway, Maine, laid out the argument made by departments nationwide: "The law enforcement community has experienced a rise in the assaults on officers. Offenders have become more violent and officer injuries have risen throughout the United States," the police department paper said.
But Tasers are not always safe, critics say. A 2012 study by Amnesty International found that 500 people had died from being shot by police with Tasers since 2001.
For the most part, the debate is not primarily about using Tasers to subdue violent offenders. Rather, Amnesty targets the practice of using Tasers on nonviolent suspects, too.
"Of the hundreds who have died following police use of Tasers in the USA, dozens and possibly scores of deaths can be traced to unnecessary force being used," said Susan Lee, Americas program director at Amnesty International, in the study. "This is unacceptable, and stricter guidelines for their use are now imperative."
In Miami Beach, police are conducting an investigation into the death of 18-year-old Hernandez-Llach. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, an independent state agency, will review the report, though it can only make recommendations.

But the family has questioned why Tasers were needed to subdue a graffiti artist.
A police spokesperson told The New York Times Friday that "no crime has been committed here" and that there was "definitely no gross negligence" on the part of the officer who fired the Taser. The officer, Jorge Mercado, has been put on paid administrative leave, but could be restored any time the police chief decides, according to the Times.
Social Market Research (SMR) have conducted a series of focus groups to provide research evidence into the handling of public hospital complaints in Ireland. The research was commissioned by the Office of the Ombudsman and published in the investigative report: “Learning to Get Better”.
The research found that the complaints process in many public hospitals was often confusing with many people unaware of their right to escalate complaints to the Office of the Ombudsman.
Further, the research also identified that some people were afraid to raise complaints due to “a fear of repercussions for their own or their relatives' treatment”. Many also expressed “a lack of confidence that anything would change as a result of complaining”.
Donal McDade, Managing Director of Social Market Research said: “The research we carried out indicated a large sentiment of mistrust with the complaints procedures in public hospitals in Ireland. Only by talking to people with first-hand experience as users of the public hospital system can we understand the challenges they face.We anticipate that the outcomes from this research will help support positive change within this sector”.

It's been a little more than a month since Roku debuted its 4K-capable Roku 4 set-top box, and now those early adopters have an all-4K-UHD channel to enjoy.
Smithsonian Earth launched Tuesday for both the Roku and Apple TV; only the Roku box, however, is able to support 4K video. Users can try the network out for free, after which service is billed at $4 per month.
Along with the new Smithsonian content, Roku users will also gain access to CW's Seed comedy network and Encore Play, a new premium channel.
Encore joins Starz Play on Roku, which launched back in September. Like Starz before it, Encore Play requires you to be subscribed to the cable channel in order to access content. There is no way for Roku customers to get either channel on an la carte basis.
Roku also announced that CW Seed would be coming to its lineup.
Tuesday's announcements covered a wide variety of programming which expands the breadth of content already available on Roku. Smithsonian's educational content joins other solid providers like History and the A&E Network, while Encore Play further rounds out Roku's premium movie content, which also includes HBO Go and Showtime.
CW Seed includes full runs of Who's Line is it Anyway, The Ben Stiller Show, The OC, and Almost Human, as well as several original programs. That service, unlike the other two announced today will be free, Roku says.
The impact on you: If you're a Roku subscriber, it means quite a bit more content is coming your way. Roku's been around for a while, but with increasing competition coming from all sides—Apple TV, Amazon's Fire TV, and even non-traditional competitors like TiVo's new Bolt set-top box—every manufacturer is looking for something to set its product apart from the pack.
Scientists from Maynooth University have played a key role in the Rosetta Mission, which today made history by landing its Philae probe on a comet when it touched down on Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.
Susan McKenna-Lawlor, Professor Emeritus, is a director of the company Space Technology Ireland Ltd (STIL) which designed, constructed and tested the onboard Electrical Support System (ESS) processor unit, a system which will play a key role in passing the streams of commands and data between the Rosetta spacecraft and the instruments on the Lander. Since the success of the Lander depends on the successful acquisition of scientific data from the comet nucleus, the ESS is defined to be mission critical hardware. Professor McKenna-Lawlor is currently at the mission control centre at the DLR German Aerospace Centre.
Laurence O'Rourke, who is the ESA lander systems engineer and a key scientist involved in the Rosetta mission, is a graduate of Experimental Physics at Maynooth University.
The Rosetta mission has been under way for more than two decades: from agreement in 1993 through launch in 2004 to having a satellite in position above Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta was launched in March 2004 and reached the comet in August 2014 becoming the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. The spacecraft consists of two main elements: the Rosetta space probe orbiter, which features 12 instruments, and the Philae robotic lander, with an additional nine instruments.
Although we have landed on planets, moons and asteroids, it has never been attempted for a nucleus of a comet, which have a very low gravity, are loosely composed of ice, dust and rocks, and are very irregular in shape.
Ends.

In English: USA asked Norway to arrest Edward Snowden
Kort tid etter at varsleren Edward Snowden hadde stått fram som kilden for de enorme avsløringene av masseovervåking kom budskapet fra USA i en formell diplomatisk melding:
– Hvis Edward Snowden på noen som helst måte forsøker å komme seg inn i Norge ber vi dere om å varsle USAs ambassade. Deretter ber vi dere umiddelbart returnere ham til USA ved bruk av innreisenekt, utvisningsvedtak eller andre lovlige virkemidler, skrev amerikanerne i et brev til Utenriksdepartementet den 27. juni 2013.
Samme dag sendte FBIs regionale kontor et brev til Justisdepartementet og et kontaktpunkt hos Kripos. I brevet beskrives Snowden som en kriminell på flukt, og det understrekes at Norge og andre skandinaviske land kontaktes etter en kartlegging av direkteflyginger fra Moskva.
Mr. Snowden was born on June 21, 1983 in the United States.  They are a Caucasian male with brown hair and eyes, and wears glasses. brev fra USAs ambassade til UD, datert 27. juni 2013
Dette kommer fram i hittil hemmeligholdte dokumenter fra Utenriksdepartementet og Justisdepartementet som NRK har fått tilgang til.
I et brev til de skandinaviske landene varsler FBI og ber om ekstra forberedelser hvis Snowden skulle komme. Foto: faksimile av brev sendt fra FBI til norske justismyndigheter den 27. juni 2013
(les alle dokumentene i bunnen av saken)
– Jeg har aldri selv sett slike dokumenter, men hadde hørt at de skulle eksistere, sier Snowdens advokat Ben Wizner til NRK.
Han regner med USA sendte lignende dokumenter til de fleste europeiske land og mange andre land, da Snowden stod fram som kilden for overvåkingsavløringen.
Snowden var i en lengre periode innesperret på flyplassen i Moskva. Them er han sammen med Wikileaks-medarbeideren Sarah Harrison som bistod ham med reisen. Foto: Tanya Lokshina / Ap
På dette tidspunktet i 2013 hadde varsleren reist fra Hong Kong til Moskva, og var i en høyst usikker situasjon i et venteområde på flyplassen der. Snowden hadde gjort det klart overfor journalister at han regnet med å bli verdens mest jagede mann så fort han stod fram som kilden.
Alt som: Avsløringene av masseovervåking
Fra flyplassen sendte han derfor 1. juli søknad om asyl til en lang rekke land. Også Norge mottok en slik asylsøknad på faks til ambassaden i Moskva. Svaret fra norske myndigheter kom raskt - søknaden ville ikke bli behandlet fordi den ikke var fremsatt på norsk jord.
Reagerer på press
At Norge ikke ville behandle asylsøknaden virker ikke å ha roet ned amerikanske myndigheter.
The Embassy of the United States of America (..) requests the provisional arrest for the purpose of extradition of U.S. citizen Edward SNOWDEN (..) brev fra USAs ambassade til UD, 4. juli 2013
USA fortsatte å presse Norge og holde tett kontakt med det norske statsapparatet.
4. juli 2013 ble et nytt formelt dokument lagt på bordet i et møte mellom UD og den amerikanske ambassaden i Oslo.
Brevet er en formell utleveringsbegjæring for Edward Snowden, og krever også at han pågripes så fort han kommer inn i Norge eller bruker landet for mellomlanding.
– USA ber innstendig om at Snowden holdes i varetekt, hvis han blir pågrepet, er det klare budskapet i amerikanernes brev.
Advokaten i USA som koordinerer den juridiske bistanden for Edward Snowden er ikke overrasket over at the USA har presset andre land, men reagerer på hvordan de ønsket at Snowdens sak skulle behandles.
– Det er problematisk hvordan USA i så stor grad foreslo for andre land at de skulle utlevere ham - før han fikk mulighet til å be om asyl og få saken sin vurdert, sier Ben Wizner som jobber i borgerrettighetsorganisasjonen ACLU i New York.
Advokat Ben Wizner koordinerer en hel gruppe jurister som bistår Edward Snowden over hele verden etter at han stod fram som kilden for overvåkingsavsløringene. Foto: Gro Holm / NRK
– Hvordan mener du norske myndigheter burde håndtere dette?
– Alle politiske ledere i et fritt samfunn burde være klare på at dette er et juridisk spørsmål og ikke handler om politikk. Det burde de gjøre klart overfor USA. Etter internasjonal rett har en som forfølges for politiske lovbrudd rett til å be om asyl før en utleveringsbegjæring i det hele tatt behandles, svarer Wizner.
Dokumentene NRK har fått innsyn viser hvor viktig det var for the USA å få kontroll på Snowden, og det inkluderte også datamaskinene hans.
the Embassy requests the seizure of all articles acquired as a result of the offenses (..) This includes, but is not limted to, all computer devices, electronic storage devices, and other forms of electronic media. utleveringsbegjæring for Edward J. Snowden sendt til Norge den 4. juli 2013
Snowden invitert til Norge for å motta pris
Så langt NRK har greid å bringe på det rene er utleveringsbegjæringen fortsatt aktiv.
NRK vet at Edward Snowden den dag i dag har et eget saksnummer hos Kripos. De fikk saken fra Justisdepartementet via påtalemyndigheten.
Om litt over ei uke tildeler Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson-akademiet sin årlige pris til Edward Snowden for hans avsløringer av elektronisk overvåking som en trussel mot ytringsfriheten.
Snowden er invitert til Norge for å motta prisen, men hva skjer om han lander på Gardermoen kan ingen svare klart og tydelig på.
En plakat av Edward Snowden har en prominent plass ved skrivebordet til advokaten hans i USA, Ben Wizner i ACLU. Foto: Gro Holm / NRK
Da Snowden ble presentert som årets prisvinner ba Bjørnsonfestivalen både statsminister Erna Solberg og justisminister Anders Anundsen om en garanti for Snowdens trygghet slik at han kunne komme for å motta prisen.
En slik garanti har ikke regjeringen vært villig til å gi, men at det faktisk finnes en utleveringsbegjæring har heller ikke vært kjent.
– Snowden er veldig takknemlig for å få denne Bjørnsonprisen. Spørsmålet er nå hvordan Norge ville håndtert det hvis han forsøker å ta imot prisen, sier Snowdens advokat Ben Wizner.
Advokaten går langt i å antyde at norske politikere har vært feige.
– Synes dere at verden er blitt bedre eller verre etter Snowdens avsløringer? Synes dere at våre frie demokratier har blitt sterkere og bedre på grunn av debatten avsløringene skapte? Og hvis dere kan si ja på det; tror dere virkelig at the USA vil komme til å straffe sine allierte i Norge hvis dere respekterer Snowdens rett på å få vurdert ønsket om asyl, spør Ben Wizner retorisk rettet mot norske politikere.
Advokaten er tydelig på at klienten har gjort noe som kan kalles et politisk lovbrudd, og som dermed både i internasjonal og norsk utleveringsrett har et spesielt vern. Wizner mener Snowden aldri kunne fått en rettferdig rettssak i USA hvis han skal forfølges etter de lovene han nå er siktet for.
– Han ville måtte møte i retten beskyldt for å bryte en lov laget under første verdenskrig – Espionage act. Under slike forhold er det umulig for Snowden å presentere et relevant forsvar. Ingen argumenter om hvordan handlingene hans har hjulpet samfunnet vil bli hørt, selv om både domstoler, kongressen og Obama har vedgått at han avslørte alvorlige feil i overvåkingsstaten, sier Wizner.
Snowdens sak sendt hele veien til politiet
Interne e-poster som NRK har fått se viser at store deler av statsapparatet er blitt involvert i henvendelsen om pågripelse fra USA. I en e-post skriver avdelingen i Utenriksdepartementet med ansvaret for Nord-Amerika at de allerede tidlig sendte signaler til USA om hva Norge vil gjøre om Snowden dukker opp.
Seksjonen fremholdt at hvis så skulle skje ville Norge holde sine rettslige forpliktelser og norsk rettsvesen ville vurdere saken. brev fra UDs seksjon for sikkerhetspolitikk og Nord-Amerika sendt til Justisdepartementet, Statsmini / 27. juni 2013
NRK har over lengre tid arbeidet for å finne ut hva som skjedde med utleveringsbegjæringen:
Hva svarte Norge til USA?
Ble det tatt noen beslutning?
Hva skjer om han kommer til Norge?
Undersøkelsene viser at saken gikk fra Utenriksdepartementet til Justisdepartementet.
Derfra ble saken sendt til påtalemyndigheten ved Riksadvokaten som ble bedt «om å ta stilling til anmodningen dersom Snowden skulle komme til Norge».
– I Justisdepartementets oversendelsesbrev av 5. juli 2013 ba departementet om at påtalemyndigheten tar stilling til anmodningen dersom Snowden skulle komme til Norge. Dette er fortsatt situasjonen. I tråd med fast praksis gir vi ingen vurdering av, eller svar på, hypotetiske spørsmål om hvordan begjæringen ville ha blitt vurdert om Snowden hadde kommet til Norge i 2013 eller om han skulle komme hit i fremtiden, skriver førstestatsadvokat Anne Grøstad hos Riksadvokaten i en e-post til NRK.
Riksadvokaten sendte saken til Det nasjonale statsadvokatembetet, og til slutt kom saken til Kripos.
Hos Kripos har Snowdens sak fått et anmeldelelsesnummer. De bekrefter at saken ikke er avsluttet, og at de er bedt om å varsle statsadvokaten om noe skjer.
– De har bedt om å orienteres dersom Kripos mottar nye opplysninger om Snowden, skriver politiinspektør Reinert M. Ottesen i Kripos til NRK i en e-post.
Regjeringen vil ikke bruke unntaksregel i Snowden-sak

Brevene fra amerikanske myndigheter gikk i all hovedsak til Utenriksdepartementet som vanligvis har dialogen med andre land.
I intervju med NRK hevder UD at Norge aldri har svart amerikanske myndigheter på utleveringsbegjæringen.
– Hva svarte norske myndigheter på amerikanernes anmodning?
– Den noten er ikke besvart, sier kommunikasjonssjef Frode O. Andersen i UD med henvisning til den diplomatiske meldingen fra USA som inneholdt utleveringsbegjæringen.
Spørsmål om hvordan USAs ønske om pågripelse er vurdert i Norge henviser han videre til Justisdepartementet. Også Justisdepartementet hevder at the USA aldri fikk noe formelt svar.
– Snowden kom aldri til Norge sommeren 2013. Derfor ble det heller aldri aktuelt å svare amerikanerne på utleveringsbegjæringen, sier statssekretær Jøran Kallmyr (Frp) til NRK.
– Men korrespondansen NRK sitter på viser at UD allerede tidlig ga signaler – viser ikke dette at Norge faktisk har snakket med og svart USA?
– Det Norge har gjort er å fortelle amerikanske myndigheter hvordan det norske systemet fungerer. Hvis de ber om å få utlevert en person er det påtalemyndigheten som vurderer om en sak skal bringes for retten, og domstolen vurderer om vilkårene for utlevering er oppfylt, svarer Kallmyr.
– Hvorfor har saken et saksnummer hos norsk politi?
– Det er ikke kjent for meg, men det er ikke noe uvanlig med at norsk politi er forberedt i tilfelle Snowden skulle komme til Norge, sier Kallmyr.

Statssekretæren svarer igjen og igjen at saken ikke er behandlet slik at det er fattet noe vedtak i Justisdepartementet. Saken vil først behandles når Snowden eventuelt kommer til Norge.
– Ville Snowden blitt pågrepet om han kom til Norge for å motta Bjørnsonprisen?
– Det er opp til påtalemyndigheten å vurdere fordi det henger sammen med om vilkårene for utlevering er til stede. De vil i en slik vurdering se på om pågripelse er nødvendig, men uansett må saken opp for en domstol, sier Jøran Kallmyr.
Hovedregelen etter utleveringsloven er at påtalemyndigheten behandler saken, og at en domstol vurderer saken før den kommer til endelig avgjørelse hos regjeringen i Justisdepartementet.
Samtidig finnes det et unntak i loven der regjeringen kan stanse saken allerede før den sendes til påtalemyndigheten fordi mener utleveringen helt klart ikke skal gjennomføres. Snowdens sak kunne for eksempel vært stanset hvis man klart anså det han har gjort som et politisk lovbrudd.
– Har bruk av et slikt unntak vært vurdert?
– Nei, det er ikke aktuelt. Vi mener det mest riktige sporet er at vi følger vanlig praksis for utleveringssaker og ikke en unntaksregel, svarer Kallmyr.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: New York has become the latest state to join an agreement that would transform the way we elect the president of the United States. Under the compact for a national popular vote, states across the country have pledged to award their electoral votes to the presidential candidate who wins the nationwide popular vote. If enough states sign on, it would guarantee the presidency goes to the candidate who wins the most votes across the country. It would prevent scenarios like what happened in 2000, when Al Gore won the popular vote but still lost the election to George W. Bush.
AMY GOODMAN: The compact will kick in only when enough states have signed on to reach a threshold of 270 electoral votes. This week, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo brought the campaign a step closer, adding New York's 29 electoral votes to those already pledged by nine other states, including California, Illinois, Massachusetts and by Washington, D.C. In a statement, Governor Cuomo said, quote, “By aligning the Electoral College with the voice of the nation's voters, we are ensuring the equality of votes and encouraging candidates to appeal to voters in all states, instead of disproportionately focusing on early contests and swing [states].” New York State Senator Joseph Griffo, a Republican, sponsored the bill.
STATE SEN. JOSEPH GRIFFO: Potential presidential candidates concentrate more than two-thirds of their advertising budget and two-thirds of their campaign stops in just five states. Almost 100 percent of their message is seen in approximately 16 battleground states. New York has 19.5 million people, but we're routinely ignored by campaigns. I want to empower people. I want to make New York state relevant in a national campaign again. I want democracy that creates excitement in people, not apathy. Joining the National Popular Vote compact creates that opportunity. It leverages the combined power of the states in a compact to say, “No longer can you take us for granted. No longer can you effectively disenfranchise a million of Americans by ignoring us. No longer can you assume that you have our vote.”
AMY GOODMAN: To talk more about the campaign for a national popular vote, we're joined now by Hendrik Hertzberg, staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. They have been writing in support of the national popular vote since 2006, serves on the board of the electoral reform organization FairVote.
Rick, welcome to Democracy Now!Talk about the significance of New York joining on, but also what the national popular vote is.
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Well, it's an important step psychologically, because now the threshold, instead of being 50 percent of the way to the threshold, we're 61 percent of the way. So every little bit—every little bit helps. And, of course, New York is the media capital. Things don't really happen in the brain of the media until they happen in New York. So even though California, New Jersey, state of Washington—even though all these other states have already signed on, it's only now starting to raise to the level of some sort of public attention. And most people don't even know this is going on, and that includes people who are extremely well informed—don't even—have never even heard of this, don't realize that we're halfway—more than halfway to solving one of the central problems of our Constitution, which is the—this Electoral College setup. And the problem with the setup is not the Electoral College itself. The problem is the winner-take-all by state. That's what creates all the anomalies.
And what the National Popular Vote plan does is, by a whole bunch of states getting together to award their electors to whoever wins in all 50 states, as soon as that happens, well, then it doesn't matter what state you live in: Your vote is just as much equal to go after, to campaign for. It means that, for instance, in New York, where it's pointless to do—to do doorbell ringing, to have a coffee collection, invite your neighbors in—what difference does it make? Everybody knows which way New York is going. But if every vote, if a vote in New York is worth the same as a vote in Ohio or Pennsylvania, you get a—that really is transformational. Even more than preventing a wrong winner is that you get grassroots politics happening in every corner of the country. And if you're worried about political corruption, if you're worried about campaign finance, for example, what this would do is, all those billions raised for campaigns, instead of being funneled into a handful of states, they would have to be spread out across the whole country, so their relative impact would be much less. This is an extraordinary reform.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, what allows a group of states to be able to come together and reach a compact like this? Wouldn't a constitutional amendment be needed for this? Explain the legality of it.
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Well, this is based on two things in the Constitution. One is what you just mentioned, interstate compacts. There are hundreds of them. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, maybe not the best example lately, but that is an example of an interstate compact. It's in the Constitution. The other part is that the only thing in the Constitution about electing the president is basically a one-liner that says each state shall appoint a number of electors in such manner as the Legislature thereof may determine. That's all it says. Everything else is left to—is left to the states to figure out. And the winner-take-all notion, that's a—that's something that came in 20, 30 years after the Constitution was written. And it's because a party that controls the state Legislature isn't going to say, if given the choice between keeping all those electors for themselves or giving, you know, some portion of them to the opposition, of course they're going to do it this way.
AMY GOODMAN: This is Democratic New York State Senator Michael Gianaris, who is among those who oppose joining the compact for a national popular vote.
STATE SEN. MICHAEL GIANARIS: The current system allots Electoral College votes based on a state's population, whereas a system such as the National Popular Vote will do so based on voter turnout in a presidential election, which means states that have a high number of unregistered residents would not be counted as much, or states that have low voter turnout would not be counted as much as they are under the current system. There's also a myriad of other issues related to those that have wealth being able to saturate a big city media market to affect the outcome more than they currently do, which is already too much, as well as the possibility for some states that are unhappy with the results, potentially between Election Day and the Electoral College vote, changing their state laws to pull back out of a compact like this, which would throw the whole system into chaos.
AMY GOODMAN: That's Democratic New York State Senator Michael Gianaris. Now, interesting, he's Democrat, and the person we played for the national popular vote was a Republican. But can you answer their points?
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: He's wrong on every single one of them. You cannot withdraw from the state—interstate compact for 90 days before an election. That's part of the deal. That's part of the contract that you make.
The notion that—as far as turnout is concerned, right now there's a sort of five-to-10-point difference in the turnout between battleground states and spectator states. So when you have a nationwide vote, you're going to see—yes, you're going to see turnout increase, but don't say it like it's a bad thing.
They mention that the Electoral College is based on—is not based on how many people vote; it's based on population. And that's one of—that's sort of the original sin of the Electoral College, because the reason it's based on population is so that the three-fifths of the slaves could be counted to give the slave owners more representation. It imports—the Electoral College mechanism imports that right—which is in the Senate and the House, right into this choice of the presidency. Now, that part of it's gone now, but that is the original sin.
And of course it makes more sense for the president to be chosen by voters, one-by-one voters, rather than by states with a fixed number of votes. Even if only three people vote in a state and it's got 10 electoral votes, they'll still go to that candidate. All the National Popular Vote plan does, really, is elected the president the way we elect a dog catcher or a governor or a senator or representative. It's not that complicated.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: But my question is, given the fact that you would only need the states who equal a number of 270 votes to join the compact, and they would therefore then be decisive in terms of who would get elected if the—who wins the popular vote, but isn't it possible just as well for the compact to be broken years down the line? In other words, for new legislatures to come in and decide to leave?
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Sure, that would be possible, yeah. And actually, that's one of the advantages to this maybe over a constitutional amendment. We can try it. We can try it, see if—try electing a president democratically, see if we like it. If we like it, we can keep it. If we don't like it, we don't have to keep it. That's actually a plus, not a minus.
AMY GOODMAN: So, so far, now—
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: And I might add, Juan, that it's not as if the states that are compacting are then going to decide who's president. No, the only thing that will decide who's president is the voters in all the states that are compacting and that are not compacting. It won't make any difference whether you live in one of them or not.
AMY GOODMAN: So, now signed on: New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Illinois, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Rhode Island and Washington.
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Mm-hmm.
AMY GOODMAN: What happens next?
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Well, right now there's a focus on Connecticut, where the bill is being considered. It's kind of a one-by-one thing, state to state. Now, people may have noticed that the states that you mentioned are all blue states. And, of course, because of what happened in 2000, Republicans tend to have a—you know, they kind of—they kind of have a—react to this and think—or, suspiciously, they think maybe this is Al Gore's revenge. But, in fact, there are plenty of Republicans who back this. If you believe in democracy, if you believe that the way to have an election is count the votes, see who wins, then it really doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat. Yes, there are these inbred prejudices. Republicans are—maybe they're more resistant to change. Maybe they think this is somehow an end run around the Constitution, which it is not, which it definitely is not. They have a—they have more skepticism to overcome. But this isn't like, you know, taxing the rich, where that's a matter of principle. It's a matter of principle the other way: If you're for democracy, you really ought to be for this.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you very much for being with us. Hendrik Hertzberg is a staff writer at The New Yorker. He's been writing in support of the national popular vote since 2006. I think you said in your last piece you had written 51 pieces on this.
HENDRIK HERTZBERG: Fifty-two as of this morning.
AMY GOODMAN: They serve on the board of the electoral reform organization FairVote. When we come back, we're going to England and to Norway to talk about drones and who's running the U.S. drone operation. Stay with us.
“Whenever they see me, people say, ‘Here comes the Dhadkan Radio woman…,” grins Ramvati, a tribal woman from the Sahariya tribe of Madhya Pradesh. Them usual day starts with a walk to five villages under their purview, where they interview people and gathers information for their very own radio programme on the local radio station, Radio Dhadkan.
While most women in these villages are mostly seen in a veil, Ramvati has created a unique identity for themselves by using community radio as a tool for change and empowerment. Watch their beautiful journey as a radio jockey and how they have brought a change in these villages, and in their own life, through their work. Like they say, “Without information, change is not possible.”

Cell C CEO Jose Dos Santos wants a woman to take over their position at the company when they step down, stating that the mobile operator currently employs many “good-looking women and clever women” in senior positions.
Dos Santos explained their stance on empowering women in the workplace during a recent interview on CliffCentral's Leadership Platform.
They said African women have a higher tolerance level than men, something they noticed while working for Vodacom in Mozambique.
When Dos Santos came to Cell C after working for Vodacom, they said there were few female-empowerment initiatives at the company – and they promised to change that.
Women have a “bitch switch”
Dos Santos said Cell C's staff complement currently sits at over 60% female, with many women at a senior executive or management level in the company.
“We have good-looking women, we have clever women, we have smart women, and that has created a different environment,” said Dos Santos.
“I think we have to empower the female individuals. Today a lot of women are independent.”
They stated that Cell C's next CEO should be a woman.
“I'm hoping that one day when I step down from Cell C, a woman will be the CEO of the company. They have a different way of managing, they have a different way of engaging in meetings, it creates a different dynamic,” they said.
“If I can use the term on your radio station, you know women do have a bitch switch, and boy if you see two women fighting it is worse than two men.”
Miss South Africa interns
Dos Santos said Cell C – which sponsors the Miss South Africa pageant – also offers all Miss SA finalist an internship for a year at the company to assist them in gaining work experience.
“It brought a whole different atmosphere. Can you imagine you got 12 gorgeous women and you say four or five of them walk into your company – do you know what it does to the atmosphere in that company? The men dress better, they shave every morning.”
Dos Santos said the Miss SA contestants who stay at Cell C after their internships are hardworking and loyal, and make valuable contributions to the company.
Taken out of context
Dos Santos released a statement following the interview, saying that their views on female employees were taken out of context.
“As a CEO with a strong track record in the empowerment of female employees, in South Africa and in many other African countries that I have worked in, I am saddened that my stance has been taken out of context,” said Dos Santos.
“The comment I made when asked about women empowerment was part of a broader interview about leadership on CliffCentral. I regret my choice of words which I realise were offensive.”

Green Bay - If multiple reports are accurate, the NFL and the officials have a deal that would put an end to the lockout and put officials back on the job.
There have been reports that the officials would be back in time to work the Baltimore-Cleveland game Thursday night, but so far the NFL or the Referee's Association has not released any information.
NorthJersey.com's Tara Sullivan reported first that a deal was imminent and that the officials would be back back on Thursday night.
NBC officiating consultant Jim Daopoulos Tweeted: "Looks like the NFL refs will be working starting Thursday in Balt. Deal appears to be completed."
Presumably, that would mean the locked-out officials would be back for all of the Sunday games, too.
It's likely the two sides will make an announcement later tonight.
Packers TE Tom Crabtree responded to the news with sarcasm on Twitter: "That was the right call for sure. Well done guys! But we're gonna go ahead n get a deal done with these other guys n fire you IMMEDIATELY!"
From a list of 18 nominees, the jury awarded this year's prize to Polish investigative reporter Tomasz Piatek in the “journalist” category, Turkish web TV Medyascopein the “media” category, and imprisoned Iranian photographer Soheil Arabi in the“citizen-journalist” category.
“Journalist” category laureate Tomasz Piatek is an investigative reporter for the Warsaw-based daily Gazeta Wyborcza who is facing a possible three-year jail termon charges brought by defence minister Antoni Macierewicz before a military court.They were prompted by a book entitled “Macierewicz and their secret” that sheds light on the minister's relations with persons linked to the Russian intelligence services. Ever since its publication, Piatek has been the target of attacks in the pro-government media and has been getting serious threats.
“Media” category laureate Medyascope is an independent Web TV launched in2015 by leading Turkish journalist Ruşen Çakır with the aim of combining newtechnology with better reporting standards to reopen a public debate now largely suppressed in Turkey, which is ranked 155th out of 180 countries in RSF's 2017 World Press Freedom Index. It uses videos that are broadcast online and are made available as podcasts to give a voice to journalists sidelined by the government's crackdown, and to citizen-journalists. Its programmes are now quite structured and include sections on a wide range of subjects such as politics, society, culture and sport. Some of its programmes are available in Kurdish, German, French and English. They include a weekly English-language podcast called “This Week in Turkey.”
“Citizen-journalist” category laureate Soheil Arabi is a Tehran-based photographer who was has been imprisoned since December 2013. After their arrest, they were mistreated and subjected to solitary confinement for two months to force them to confess to involvement in creating a Facebook network that “blasphemed” Islam and criticized the government. A long judicial saga ensued in which they were initially sentenced them to three years inprison, 30 lashes and a heavy fine. A few months later, they were retried and sentenced to death, but the death sentence was eventually overturned and in September 2015 they were sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. In July of this year, their wife was arrested and was held for eight days, and they are still being subjected to threatsand harassment. Soheil Arabi began a hunger strike at the end of August.
Laureates Tomasz Piatek and Ruşen Çakır, RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire, Strasbourg mayor Roland Ries and TV5MONDE editor-in- chief Paul Germain were among those attending these evening's award ceremony in Strasbourg, whichwas hosted by TV journalist Bernard de la Villardière. The guest of honour was Loup Bureau, a young French freelance reporter who was held for seven weeks in Turkey earlier this year. RSF waged an intensive campaign on their behalf until they were released.
CNN has been forced to retract a story aimed at undermining Donald Trump's presidency. Along with its retraction of the Russia-related article, CNN also announced three of its employees responsible for yet another fake news hit piece have resigned.
The cable news network, once the leader in its field, continues to tarnish its name and give more reason to ignore anything it reports.
“CNN said Monday that three journalists, including the executive editor in charge of a new investigative unit, have resigned after the publication of a Russia-related article that was retracted,” reported CNN's Brian Stelter. “Thomas Frank, who wrote the story in question; Eric Lichtblau, an editor in the unit; and Lex Haris, who oversaw the unit, have all left CNN.”
Stelter added: “In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story's publication.”
According to Stelter, CNN Management conducted an internal investigation that found “some standard editorial processes were not followed when the article was published.”
CNN was still unwilling to admit the story itself was inaccurate. Stelter defended the debunked story.
Another staffer interviewed after the meeting said the retraction simply meant, “that the story wasn't solid enough to publish as-is.” The staffer insisted that neither the retractions nor the resignations meant the story was wrong.
Haris, the head of the CNN investigative unit, is the only CNN official who resigned who gave a statement for the story.
“On Friday, CNN retracted a story published by my team. As Executive Editor of that team, I have resigned,” said Haris. ”I've been with CNN since 2001, and am sure about one thing: This is a news organization that prizes accuracy and fairness above all else. I am leaving, but will carry those principles wherever I go.”
President Trump has been vocal in calling out CNN for what it is – a regular funnel for fake news. Trump has criticized CNN's president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, in news conferences from the West Wing.
The battle between Trump and CNN reached a fever pitch during the summer when CNN reporter Jim Acosta launched a broadside against then White House press secretary, Sean Spicer for limiting television coverage of briefings.
The Washington Times reports that Zucker was deeply upset with last week's debacle. Zucker has invested extensive resources into covering the Trump White House and several anonymous sources at the network say they are extremely troubled there were no more internal checks on the accuracy of the story.
One of the sources said, “Mr. Zucker helped lead an internal inquiry that found the story was published despite concerns expressed by CNN's standards team.”
The resignations are the latest in a series of gaffs and outright fabrications from the network. Kathy Griffin, host of CNN New Year's Eve special lost their contract after they published a photograph in which they appeared to be holding a likeness of the President's severed head. It severed ties with host Reza Aslan after they tweeted a series of vulgar posts about Mr. Trump. And another story that inaccurately predicted the congressional testimony of James B. Comey was retracted.
Aslan, an Iranian-American scholar who was the host of the network's weekly show “Believer,” after Mr. Aslan assailed President Trump in a series of vulgar messages on Twitter after the terrorist attack at London Bridge. Their program that covered global religion was abruptly canceled after they described the president as “an embarrassment to humankind” and compared them to a piece of excrement.
CNN reported last June that Comey would dispute President Trump's claims that the FBI Director said they were not under investigation on multiple occasions.
The report, titled “Comey expected to refute Trump,” was compiled by four CNN journalists, including Brian Rokus, Gloria Borger, Eric Lichtblau, and Jake Tapper.
Just two days after CNN's apology, Borger reiterated the report's claims in an appearance on the network. In spite of knowing it to be inaccurate Borger said: “Comey is going to dispute the president on this point if he's asked about it by senators, and we have to assume that they will be,” said Borger, the network's chief political analyst. “He will say they never assured Donald Trump that they were not under investigation, that that would have been improper for them to do so.”
The strategy is obvious – report fake news and hope people don't notice the ‘retractions'.

Ubisoft's Earnings Call on Q4 2017 was full of interesting news. As reported yesterday, we can expect to see the new Assassin's Creed game, Far Cry 5, The Crew 2 and South Park: Fractured but Whole all by March 2018. However, Ubisoft also talked at length of their successes with live games, with Rainbow Six: Siege leading the pack.
CEO Yves Guillemot started by saying that Ubisoft managed to significantly expand the audience of the franchise.
Related Rainbow Six Siege Shows Off Its New Wind Bastion Operators and Map in Action
Rainbow Six Siege daily active user reached new record high during the last quarter. As a matter of fact, there is no better place than eSports confirm Rainbow Six Siege great momentum. Season one of year two is indeed seeing an amazing 500% increase in number of views.
Ubisoft registered a record 101% increase year-over-year for player recurring investment and Rainbow Six: Siege was the biggest game in this particular section.
So Rainbow Six is number one for player recurring investment, then you have The Crew, The Division, we have also Trial and For Honor that generated good revenue, as well as recently Ghost Recon.
Guillemot also promised that Ubisoft doesn't want to split the community, which seems to imply that there won't be traditional DLC packs on the way. With EA also seemingly moving away from the traditional Season Pass/DLC packs model to avoid splitting the communities, this makes us hopeful that big publishers finally learned that lesson.
What's very important to consider is that there's a change in the way games are now exploited on the market. Thanks to the fact that we have more and more players on Rainbow Six, for example. We don't want to split the community, so we bring expansion or seasons that are actually growing the number of players, so that we can continue to increase revenue without splitting the community. So the automatic impact is that we don't have the new release on that front, but it's more different strategy than anything else.
As a final note, CEO Yves Guillemot also stated that players can expect a new Ghost Recon game faster than a Rainbow Six game, likely because Siege is expected to have longer legs due to its competitive nature.
In related news, the developers of the game have recently announced Operation Health, with the objective to fix several issues and improve existing technology. Some of those include One Step Matchmaking, Voice and Party systems based on dedicated servers as well as improved hit registration and higher tick rate.

Director: Peter Jackson.
Screenplay: Peter Jackson, Guillermo del Toro, Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens.
Starring: Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ian McKellan, Evangeline Lilly, Orlando Bloom, Luke Evans, Lee Pace, Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, Aidan Turner, James Nesbitt, William Kircher, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman, John Callen, Peter Hambleton, Jed Brophy, Mark Hadlow, Adam Brown, Sylvester McCoy, Mikael Persbrandt, Stephen Fry, Ryan Gage, Cate Blanchett.
“Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of your enormity, O Smaug the Stupendous…”
Now a year down the line, the residing question of whether Peter Jackson's decision to adapt “The Hobbit” into a trilogy was a wise choice or not, has become a little easier to answer. I'd have to say, that they can probably feel somewhat vindicated as their vision seems to be working. That being said, there's still an abundance of padding and repetition going on in this second instalment – just as there was in the first – but Jackson has definitely improved here by ironing out the creases a little more.
Now fully on their journey to Erabor and the Kingdom under the mountain, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) and the dwarves must find their way through a dark, arachnid filled forest before escaping the clutches of Elfin King Thranduil (Lee Pace) and a horde of rampaging Orcs. All this before they've even faced their biggest adversary yet… “the serpent of the north”.
With all the character building already established in “The Unexpected Journey” and the omission of the drawn out and, frankly, tedious songs, Jackson finds their feet on more solid ground here. These asupervisorstioned hang-up's are what hindered the pace of the first instalment but with them now put to the side, we are allowed to enter the fray from the outset which benefits the film immeasurably. Once again, Jackson shows their highly creative abilities in staging an action set-piece and that's where most of the enjoyment comes from. They introduce some new (and old) characters that really kick things up a gear, especially the inclusion (or invention) of Evangeline Lilly's elfin warrior Tauriel, who adds a much-needed strong female character to the proceedings and Orlando Bloom's Legolas makes a welcome return. It's both of these characters who contribute greatly to a high speed river chase that's one of the film's most impressive and exciting action sequences. Speaking of which, there are many moments that are marvellously and thrillingly handled; the giant spiders in the forest to Gandalf's confrontation with the Necromancer and the showdown with Smaug as Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) storms the mountain to reclaim their throne. Although exceptionally handled they do have a tendency to feel relentless and leave very little room for actual storytelling or characterisation.
Martin Freeman is still perfectly suited for Bilbo but there's so much going on around them that they seem like a side character in their own story. Much of the focus is on the dwarves and even then, very few of them actually get to really bring their characters forth, with the exception of Armitage's Thorin and the fragility of their strong facade. The absence of Andy Serkis' Gollum is also a major drawback but Jackson does have an ace up their sleeve with the astounding motion capture of Benedict Cumberbatch as the fearsome dragon, Smaug.
It's through exploring the darker territory of Smaug or the Necromancer that Jackson's willingness to gain momentum is apparent. The laborious nature of the first is tightened up and there's no denying this one's energy or it's ability to entertain. Despite being overlong, things are kept very exciting and Jackson maintains your interest right up until the final moment where we close on a blank screen… frustratingly, awaiting part three. But then, this is what we have come to expect with the, sometimes awkward, middle section of a trilogy.
Despite some of the criticisms I heard (and shared) about “The Unexpected Journey“, I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and, ultimately, that's the whole point. It's escapism of the highest kind. With this being an improvement on that, it still boasts well for the trilogy to go out with a bang, in the way “The Lord of the Rings” done so brilliantly.

Trivia: Martin Freeman and Benedict Cumberbatch filmed their roles while on hiatus from their television series Sherlock (2010). Stephen Fry played Sherlock's brother Mycroft in Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011), while Christopher Lee (Sauron) played Sherlock in two other films as well as playing Mycroft in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970), which also featured Robert Stephens (Aragorn on BBC Radio) as Holmes.

While the two Democratic presidential candidates often spend time praising President Barack Obama on the campaign trail, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are opposing the White House's efforts to kill a bill that would allow families of those killed in the 9/11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia.
The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee this year, would eliminate immunity for foreign governments that played a role in terrorist attacks on American soil. Saudi Arabia has warned that it will sell off billions in American assets if the bill passes, the New York Times reported, and the Obama administration has lobbied Congress to block the bill.
Clinton and Sanders each initially said they were not familiar with the legislation despite it being in the news for weeks. When the former secretary of state was asked about the issue on ABC's “This Week” with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, they said they would “have to look into it.”
“Obviously we've got to make anyone who participates in or supports terrorism pay a price. And we also have to be aware of any consequences that might affect Americans, either military or civilian, or our nation,” Clinton said.
Them campaign later released a statement that said families and terror victims need to “hold accountable those responsible. As president, she'd work to Congress on that end.”
Sanders similarly said they wanted to look at the legislation but then released a statement expressing strong support for the bill, which is co-sponsored by Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican.
“I support legislation by Sen. Chuck Schumer that would allow Americans, including the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks, to use U.S. courts to determine if foreign entities are culpable for terrorist attacks in the United States and seek restitution for the damages and lives lost,” the Sanders statement said.
The Vermont senator also urged the Obama administration to “declassify the 28-page section of the 9/11 Commission Report on the potential sources of foreign support received by the hijackers.”
The Saudi Arabian government's threat of economic retaliation has angered members of Congress and families of 9/11 victims in recent days. Families have also expressed frustration over Obama's opposition to the 9/11 bill, the New York Daily News reported.
Families have been trying for years to convince the U.S. government to release the 28 pages of the report that Sanders mentioned, and now they see this attempt to block them from suing Saudi Arabia as the latest offense.
For Clinton and Sanders, the controversy over the 9/11 bill comes just before the crucial New York primary election, where they are each hoping to pull out a strong performance and prove that they have momentum going into the last stretch of nominating contests. Clinton so far has maintained their lead in the state, but Sanders has continued to gain ahead of the election Tuesday.
VA secretary resigns amid push to privatize US veterans' health care
By Kate Randall
31 May 2014
President Barack Obama accepted the resignation of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Eric Shinseki at a White House press conference Friday morning. The retired general's exit comes amidst a mounting scandal over veterans' health care. It follows the release Wednesday of a report by the VA Office of the Inspector General (OIG) showing that VA officials falsified records to cover up the long wait times of US veterans for medical appointments.
The OIG's interim report revealed that patients at the Phoenix Veterans' Hospital waited an average of 114 days for an initial appointment, far greater than the averages reported by hospital officials. Many of these officials received awards and salary increases based on the falsified numbers.
Doctors at the Phoenix, Arizona hospital have charged that delays in treatment were responsible for at least 40 preventable deaths. An earlier internal VA review found that long wait times at VA hospitals in multiple states were linked to 23 deaths.
Before resigning, Shinseki announced the removal of senior leaders at the Phoenix VA hospital and the elimination of performance awards for VA leaders in 2014. These moves will do little to resolve the crisis engulfing the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).
As new exposures emerge of the deplorable treatment of veterans at VA facilities, growing numbers of congressional Democrats as well as Republicans are seizing on the crisis to ramp up calls for the privatization of veterans' health care.
The VHA is the largest integrated health care network in the US, with 150 VA hospitals and 820 outpatient clinics as of 2013, enrolling about 9.3 million of the nation's 22 million veterans. The system handled 84 million outpatient visits in 2012, a 23 percent increase over 2008. These numbers are expected to continue to swell as growing numbers of soldiers from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan seek treatment, along with aging Vietnam War veterans.
Obama and members of Congress have responded to the VHA scandal with a breathtaking level of cynicism and hypocrisy, even by Washington standards. The same president who, in announcing Shinseki's resignation, stated, “We will never stop working to do right by you and your families” only two days before in a speech at the West Point military academy vowed that the US “will use military force, unilaterally if necessary, when our core interests demand it.”
A byproduct of this acceleration of military aggression across the globe will be increasing numbers of veterans seeking treatment for brain injuries, post-traumatic stress disorder, lost limbs and other horrific injuries. The VHA is woefully understaffed, underfunded and wracked by bureaucracy and corruption. But according to many lawmakers, the answer to this crisis is not the appropriation of funds to hire new doctors and other medical professionals, but the dismantling of the government program in order to provide a profit windfall to private insurers and health industry firms. The result of this policy will be less care at greater cost to veterans.
Rep. Jeff Miller (Republican of Florida), chairperson of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, stated, “We have an opportunity now to transform the way the VA does business.” Their committee, which has already moved legislation through the House giving the VA secretary greater authority to fire or demote senior VA executives, says they intend to bring legislation that would allow veterans who have been waiting more than 30 days for an appointment to receive medical care through private doctors and hospitals.
Under the “Veterans Choice Plan” being promoted by Rep. Andy Harris (Republican of Maryland), veterans could either choose to continue receiving care through the VHA or go to a private provider of their choosing. In what amounts to a voucher system, the federal government would cover the cost of insurance premiums and some out-of-pocket costs, depending on a veteran's priority ranking.
Harris, who will send their plan to the House Veterans' Affairs Committee within the week, believes it would be “budget neutral” or might even reduce veterans' health spending. In other words, the VHA would be deprived of funds while money is diverted directly into the pockets of the private insurers and health care industry.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Democrat of California) voiced their support Thursday for privatizing more health care services for veterans. “I don't have any problem with that,” they told reporters in the Capitol. Commenting on Rep. Miller's plan, they said, “It isn't a panacea, but I would certainly be open to that because of volume [at the VHA] and because of geography.”
Pelosi said they were not concerned that Republican proposals threatened the dismantling of the VA system in favor of the private health care sector. “I don't think that's how they see it,” they said, urging others in Congress to “think in a bigger way” about medical care for veterans.
These privatization plans are strikingly similar to the proposal by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (Republican of Wisconsin) to set up a voucher system for Medicare. Their plan, which would provide a stipend for individuals to purchase private insurance, is aimed at gutting and ultimately dismantling the government-run national insurance program for the elderly and disabled.
A number of veterans groups are opposed to moves to privatize veterans' health care precisely because they threaten funding for the current VHA system and the specialized care the network of hospitals and clinics was designed to provide. Joe Violante, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, told Vox.com, “The more money we spend out on the private sector on veterans, the less money there is to care for those that are within the system.”
Carl Blake of Paralyzed Veterans of America told Vox.com that a typical VA patient “might have a spinal cord injury, plus an orthopedic issue, plus a mental health issue. They're a multifaceted patient.” They added, “The VA is a system constructed to provide holistic care for the life of that patient. The private system is not constructed with those ideas in mind.”
The proposals to privatize veterans' health care services come as the Veterans Affairs system is struggling with an acute shortage of doctors, particularly primary care doctors. According to a Friday article in the New York Times, VA doctors often work 13-hour days and nurse practitioners often treat complex cases that should be handled by doctors. Doctor pay at veterans' centers is significantly lower than in the private sector, and hospitals and clinics suffer from high turnover rates.
The Times noted that in the past three years, primary care appointments have increased 50 percent, while the VHA staff of primary care doctors has grown by only 9 percent.
Under these dire conditions, the House last month passed an annual spending bill that included a minimal $1.5 billion increase for fiscal year 2015 to fund veterans' programs, bringing the total to $64.7 billion. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chair Miller made clear any large infusion of cash for veterans' health care is not in the cards, commenting, “I believe that if money had solved the problem, it would have been fixed a long time ago.”
The moves to privatize veterans' health care underscore the hypocrisy of the bipartisan glorification of soldiers and veterans. It also sets a precedent for privatizing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor.

NEW DELHI: India has lost another case against the US at WTO as the body ruled that India's domestic content requirements under its solar power programme were inconsistent with the international norms.Last year, the US dragged India to WTO on country's solar mission plan.The US alleged that India's programme appears to discriminate against the US solar equipment by requiring solar energy producers to use locally manufactured cells and by offering subsidies to those developers who use domestic equipment.It also alleged that forced localization requirements restricted US exports to Indian markets.On January 11, 2010, India launched its national solar policy — Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission The country has an ambitious target of generating 20,000MW of solar power by 2022.The US companies see this target as a great business opportunity for them. Because of this, they want India to remove the clause of local content requirement.This was the second case where India has lost against the US in WTO. In June this year, India lost a case when the WTO ruled that the Indian ban on import of poultry meat, eggs and live pigs from the US was inconsistent with the global norms.
On October 7, unemployed 52 year old Fujimura Hideaki of Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture was arrested on charges of violating Japanese copyright law. They had been uploading Japanese television shows onto the video streaming site Dailymotion. Their uploaded content included music shows, dramas, and variety programs. The uploaded videos included content from various channels including Fuji TV, TBS, TV Asahi, and WOWOW. They had uploaded over 2600 videos using various usernames. Their various Dailymotion channels had around 3 million views in total. Fukushima Prefecture's cyber crimes unit discovered the illegally uploaded content during a cyber crimes investigation. This could have a ripple effect on international consumers of Japanese media and overseas Japanese.
News footage on the arrest
Hideaki's channels have been the main source the music programs posted on AramaJapan (this being said we're looking for alternative sources). They were very quick to upload and reliable. They uploaded in good quality and included a variety of programs. There have been complaints in the past among users of this site about videos being taken down and this arrest is the culmination of those efforts to stop their various channels.
There is a fear among many international consumers of Japanese media that this is but the first in perhaps a larger series of arrests of illegal uploaders. This arrest may also serve as a warning to other illegal uploaders, stopping them in their tracks. This all results in less content for us to consume. Without these people, we wouldn't have what content we do have.
This all comes down to Japan's stringent copyright laws. They are dead set on protecting their content as much as possible. However, this somewhat flies in the face of their efforts to revive the Cool Japan campaign. Cool Japan is being revived as a means of competing against the enormous growth in recent years of South Korea's Hallyu. Hallyu strives in part because of South Korea's very lax copyright laws. South Korean media is very easily accessed online by people from around the world. This enables it to grow. Japan, on the other hand, is trying to keep as much of their content offline as possible. How are people overseas, the people who Cool Japan is supposed to be trying to reach, supposed to get content? It's not as if TV Asahi is uploading Music Station on YouTube in HD like various Korean channels do with their music shows. This leads us to turn to less than legal alternatives. If those alternatives are stopped, then what? This brings to mind the Manga-Anime Guardians project from a few months ago. That program wants to shut down sites that pirate manga and anime. A number of those sites are the only sites where non-Japanese speakers can find subbed content. If those sites are shut down, then what? Are the content makers going to start subbing their content on their own. Unlikely.
Japan says that it wants to expand its media overseas but then they do things like this, which pushes the remaining international fans further away. It's like they're pushing fans that already exist away, in an effort to get new fans who may or may not materialize.
It's every social media manager's worst nightmare.
Dan Scavino Jr., who runs social media for President Donald Trump, accidentally tweeted out an attack on NBC News from both their account and Trump's account on Wednesday.
Scavino quickly deleted the tweet. The tweet on Trump's account is still up.
NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2017
I don't think Trump did this tweet pic.twitter.com/HXZHPr6Nls — Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) October 4, 2017
The error provides a glimpse behind the scenes of how Trump's Twitter account is run. It has been generally assumed that Trump sends most of their own tweets.
Trump may have still dictated this tweet—it certainly has that classic Trump tone—and Scavino might have just accidentally sent from both accounts.
The tweet appears to be in response to an NBC News report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson once called trump a "moron" and nearly quit.
Trump's Twitter account has taken on an almost unfathomably important role in geopolitics, particularly after recent tweets directed at North Korea that have escalated tensions over its nuclear and missile programs.
This is the second major social media mistake from Scavino in as many months. In September, they tweeted out a video of a storm in relation to Hurricane Irma. The video ended up being entirely unrelated to Irma.
RoadSense campaigner William Walton accused of hypocrisy after relocating to the north-east of England.
SWNS
The man responsible for driving forward the campaign to block the Aberdeen bypass is plotting their legal challenge from their new home - in the north-east of England.
William Walton, the man behind the RoadSense group which has campaigned against the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), has left Scotland after losing their university job.
The news has sparked anger among people in the north-east of Scotland given Walton's opposition to the AWPR, which business leaders believe is essential if Aberdeen is to devise a traffic infrastructure fit for the 21st century.
Walton recently exited Scotland after taking a voluntary severance package from Aberdeen University and has defended their continuing opposition to the AWPR. The verdict on their appeal against the project will be announced in the UK Supreme Court on Wednesday.
"Following the decision of the [Aberdeen] University to close the postgraduate degree programmes in urban and rural planning, I decided to take voluntary severance," said Walton, who still owns a residential property in Westhill.
"I took up a lecturing position at Northumbria Law School at the beginning of September."
However, Walton's relocation has been attacked by several Aberdeen politicians, who maintain that it is hypocritical for them to object to the AWPR while traffic gridlock increases in the city and they are 250 miles away from where the problems are happening.
"I have branded RoadSense as 'RoadNonsense' before - and now we find out their prime Nimby is protesting against a road which is nowhere near their back yard," said the SNP MSP Kevin Stewart.
"People in the north-east will be aghast about this situation.
"The vast majority of people want this road to go ahead as soon as possible. So the hypocrisy of William Walton and their small band of backers knows no bounds."
That stance was echoed by Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald, who added: "Obviously, there are people helping to fund this [legal] challenge and I would hope they will not continue that funding, should the decision this week not go their way."
The Supreme Court will confirm their ruling on Wednesday morning.
The Government was subjected to an intense lobbying campaign by the pharmaceutical industry earlier this year over a HSE decision not to approve for payment new drugs and medicine.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny was warned the decision could have implications for 25,000 jobs and future investment.
Early this year, the HSE decided not to reimburse new drugs that had passed all regulatory stages and were becoming available for use in patients. They included drugs for treating skin cancer and cost up to €85,000.
In correspondence with Mr Kenny, up to 20 multinational drug firms claimed that the HSE move was portraying Ireland negatively and could have “unintended consequences” for Ireland.
The details have emerged against a backdrop of continuing controversy over the price of medicines and Government efforts to curb costs, including the cost of drugs. A recent survey found that the cost of some medicines here is among the highest in the world.
Price referencing
It has also emerged that the price paid for drugs in Ireland is of critical importance for pharmaceutical companies as it influences the price in many other countries, both within and outside the EU, as part of an international price-referencing effect.
Earlier this year the HSE argued that no specific budget had been provided to it to pay for the cost of new drugs and medicines coming on the market after approval.
However, the multinational drug companies argued that a ban on reimbursing new drugs by the HSE represented a breach of a supply agreement with the State.
In June Minister for Health James Reilly reached an interim deal with the pharmaceutical industry that involved reductions in the price of certain off-patent medicines. They claimed this could save up to €20 million in a full year.
As a condition of the agreement the HSE was obliged to add to its list of items for reimbursement “drugs which in the normal course of events would have been approved under its schemes”.
In effect, this meant that the HSE could not refuse to pay for drugs for financial reasons.
In October the Government secured a full agreement with the pharmaceutical industry which it said could generate €400 million in savings over three years. In return for making price concessions, the pharmaceutical companies reinforced the principle that new medicines will be approved under the HSE's drug schemes once they have been proven to be cost effective.
Strong representations
However, new documents released by the Government show that Mr Kenny received strong representations on the cuts by leading pharmaceutical companies. The letters had been written in February and March and many struck a similar tone.
In one, the president of Eli Lilly, John C Lechleiter, was concerned that “your Government's recent decision not to reimburse new medicines puts at risk this aspiration and portrays Ireland negatively to inward investors such as Lilly”.
Mr Lechleiter pointed out that Lilly employed more than 700 people in Ireland in two manufacturing sites. “I believe further price cuts and a blanket ban on reimbursement of new medicines could have a number of unintended consequences for the wider Irish economy.”
The chairperson of Johnson and Johnson, William C Weldon, told Mr Kenny in a letter: “When new medicines are scientifically and independently judged to be of value and improve health outcomes, it is imperative that they are made available to Irish patients.”
During a talk at the National Governors Association on Saturday, Elon Musk shared a bold prediction for the future of personal transportation. Not only do they believe that half the cars produced in the United States just 10 years from now will be electric, they think almost all cars produced by then will be autonomous.
“In 10 years, half of all production will be EV,” they told the governors. “I think almost all cars produced will be autonomous in 10 years, almost all. It will be rare to find one that is not, in 10 years.”
While EVs and autonomous cars will comprise a bulk of new vehicles, however, that doesn't mean they will be the majority on the roads. “New vehicle production is only about five percent of the size of the vehicle fleet,” Musk explained, and because a car or truck can last for 15 to 20 years, it will take some time for the old to be replaced by the new. “Even when new vehicle production switches over to electric or autonomous…that still means the vast majority of the fleet is not,” they noted.

Italian coastguard say 10 bodies recovered from sea during 16 rescue operations over one day
More than 2,200 people rescued from dinghies in Mediterranean
More than 2,200 people have been rescued in the Mediterranean as they tried to reach Europe and 10 bodies recovered, Italy's coast guard has said in a statement.
They were picked up from 13 rubber dinghies, two small boats and one large vessel in 16 separate rescue operations on Saturday.

OTTAWA -- Former Liberal leader Stephane Dion -- the prime minister's hand-picked special envoy to Europe -- has weighed in on France's fractious election, saying Canada wants the new French leader to keep the country active in the European Union.
Asked about the prospects of French far-right candidate Marine Le Pen winning Sunday's run-off election against the pro-Europe candidate Emmanuel Macron, Dion said Canada prefers the latter.
"We prefer to see at the head of a key country like France in Europe a president who is believing like us, that European integration is an asset for the world," Dion told reporters today.
"We much prefer to have as the president of a friendly country a person that shares our values regarding openness, respect for diversity.
"It's the great tradition of France and I'm optimistic it will prevail and allow Canada and France to work together with the same values."
Dion's remarks represent a departure of sorts for the federal government, which has avoided commenting directly on foreign elections -- especially those involving institution-bashing, populist candidates.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently deflected a question about the French election when they hosted Italy's prime minister.
And the Trudeau government steadfastly avoided criticizing or commenting on Donald Trump through the bitter U.S. election and their various pronouncements afterwards.
Dion offered their assessment following their testimony before the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, where they faced tough questions from Conservative and New Democrat MPs about their new assignment, which comes alongside their posting as ambassador to Germany.
Dion defended their new diplomatic appointment as "special envoy" but not ambassador to the European Union.
The announcement comes three months after the prime minister put forward Dion's name to serve as ambassador to both the EU and Germany, an unusual dual assignment.
Conservative foreign affairs critic Peter Kent said they saw "seething frustration" within Global Affairs and lots of head scratching in the EU about the double-hatted appointment.
New Democratic critic Helene Laverdiere said they heard complaints about Dion's appointment on a trip to Germany two weeks ago.
Dion says they plan to work hard, travel widely and complement the work of senior diplomats by ensuring there is "pan European approach" to Canada's engagement with the continent.
They said their job title might have evolved over time after discussions in Canada and with European officials, but the job as originally envisioned by Trudeau, has remained the same.
"This idea never changed. The title changed because it expressed better what the prime minister wanted to do in the beginning."
The Prime Minister's Office has said that making Dion a special envoy followed consultations with European partners, in which "it was agreed that this appointment will best deliver" on Canada's commitment to stronger ties.
Dion, who was foreign affairs minister until they were shuffled out of cabinet earlier this year, is to take up their new positions later this month.
Dion said they would work with the existing mission to the EU and the current ambassador, Daniel Costello.
John McCallum, the former immigration minister who now is ambassador to China, also testified Tuesday about their new job. McCallum was moved in the same January cabinet shuffle and has already started their new job.
McCallum hosted two senior ministers in Beijing last week, Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and Finance Minister Bill Morneau, both of whom took part in a new senior economic dialogue with China's vice-premier.
But McCallum made clear Canada isn't reluctant to raise thorny human rights issues with Beijing as it tries to deepen economic ties.
"We disagree on the death penalty. We disagree on some aspects of the rule of law and privately and publicly on how the Chinese government treats human rights advocates."
While Hillary Clinton occasionally gives some lip service to the problem of extreme inequality, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate really hammering away at it. They have even blasted the orthodoxy of economic growth for its own sake, saying according to Monday's Washington Post that unless economic spoils can be redistributed to make more Americans' lives better, all the growth will go to the top 1% anyway, so who needs it? Sanders might know their history, but the rest of the candidates could use a little primer.
The United States was not always the most powerful nation on Earth. It was only with the end of World War II, with the rest of the developed world in smoldering ruins, that America emerged as the free world's leader. This coincided with the expansion of the U.S. middle class. With the other war combatants trying to recover from the destruction of the war, America became the supermarket, hardware store and auto dealership to the world. Markets for American products abounded and opportunity was everywhere for American workers of all economic means to get ahead. America had a virtual monopoly on rebuilding the world. Combined with the G.I. Bill of 1944, which provided money for returning veterans to go to college, and government loans to buy houses and start businesses, the middle class in America boomed, as did American power, wealth and prestige. Between 1946 and 1973, productivity in America grew by 104 percent. Unions led the way in assuring wages for workers grew by an equal amount.

The 1970s, however, brought a screeching halt to the expansion of the American middle class. The Arab oil embargo in 1973 marked the end of cheap oil and the beginning of the middle-class decline. The Iranian Revolution in 1979, with more resultant oil instability, combined with the rise of Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution at home, accelerated the long and painful contraction of the middle class. Cuts in corporate taxes, stagnant worker wage growth, the right-wing war on unions, and corporate outsourcing of work overseas greased the wheels of the middle-class decline and the upper-class elevation. Cuts in taxes on the wealthy, under the guise of trickle-down economics, have resulted in lower government revenue and cuts to all kinds of services. All of which has led to today, an era of national and international inequality unparalleled since the days of the Roaring '20s.
Here are 35 astounding facts about inequality that will fry your brain.
1. In 81 percent of American counties, the median income, about $52,000, is less than it was 15 years ago. This is despite the fact that the economy has grown 83 percent in the past quarter-century and corporate profits have doubled. American workers produce twice the amount of goods and services as 25 years ago, but get less of the pie.
2. The amount of money that was given out in bonuses on Wall Street last year is twice the amount all minimum-wage workers earned in the country combined.
3. The wealthiest 85 people on the planet have more money that the poorest 3.5 billion people combined.
4. The average wealth of an American adult is in the range of $250,000-$300,000. But that average number includes incomprehensibly wealthy people like Bill Gates. Imagine 10 people in a bar. When Bill Gates walks in, the average wealth in the bar increases unbelievably, but that number doesn't make the other 10 people in the bar richer. The median per adult number is only about $39,000, placing the U.S. about 27th among the world's nations, behind Australia, most of Europe and even small countries like New Zealand, Ireland and Kuwait.

5. Italians, Belgians and Japanese citizens are wealthier than Americans.
6. The poorest half of the Earth's population owns 1% of the Earth's wealth. The richest 1% of the Earth's population owns 46% of the Earth's wealth.
7. More locally, the poorest half of the US owns 2.5% of the country's wealth. The top 1% owns 35% of it.
8. Inequality is a worldwide problem. In the UK, doctors no longer occupy a place in the top 1% of income earners, London plays host to the largest congregation of Russian millionaires outside of Moscow, and also houses more ultra-rich people (defined as owning more than $30 million in assets outside of their home) than anywhere else on Earth.
9. The slice of the national income pie going to the wealthiest 1% of Americans has doubled since 1979.

10. The 1% also takes home 20% of the income. This figure is the most since the 1920s era of laissez faire government (under Republicans Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover).
11. The super rich .01% of America, such as Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, take home a whopping 6% of the national income, earning around $23 million a year. Compare that to the average $30,000 a year earned by the bottom 90 percent of America.
12. The top 1% of America owns 50% of investment assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds). The poorest half of America owns just .5% of the investments.

13. The poorest Americans do come out ahead in one statistic: the bottom 90% of America owns 73% of the debt.
14. Tax rates for the middle class have remained essentially unchanged since 1960. Tax rates on the highest earning Americans have plunged from an almost 70% tax rate in 1945 down to around 35% today. Corporate tax rates have dropped from 30 percent in the 1950s to under 10 percent today.
15. Since 1990, CEO compensation has increased by 300%. Corporate profits have doubled. The average worker's salary has increased 4%. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has actually decreased.

16. CEOs in 1965 earned about 24 times the amount of the average worker. In 1980 they earned 42 times as much. Today, CEOs earn 325 times the average worker.
17. Wages, as a percent of the overall economy, have dropped to an historic low.
18. In a study of 34 developed countries, the United States had the second highest level of income inequality, ahead of only Chile.
19. Young people in the U.S. are getting poorer. The median wealth of people under 35 has dropped 68% since 1984. The median wealth of older Americans has increased 42%.

20. The average white American's median wealth is 20 times higher ($113,000) than the average African American ($5,600) and 18 times the Hispanic American ($6,300).
21. America's highest incomeinequality is located in the states surrounding Wall Street (New York City) and the oil-rich states.
22. Since 1979, high school dropouts have seen median weekly income drop by 22 percent. Ethnically, the highest dropout rates are among Hispanic and African American children.
23. In 1970, a woman earned about 60% of the amount a man earned. In 2005 a woman earned about 80% of what a man earned. Since 2005, there has been no change in that figure. African-American women earn just 64% of what a white male earns, and Hispanic women just 56%.

24. Over 20 percent of all American children live below the poverty line. This rate is higher than almost all other developed countries.
25. Union membership in the US is at an all-time low, about 11% of the workforce. In 1978, 40 percent of blue-collar workers were unionized. With that declining influence has come a concurrent decline in the real value of the minimum wage.
26. Four hundred Americans have more wealth, $2 trillion, than half of all Americans combined. That is approximately the GDP of Russia.
27. In 1946, a child born into poverty had about a 50 percent chance of scaling the income ladder into the middle class. In 1980, the chances were 40 percent. A child born today has about a 33 percent chance.

Now that the silence around Harvey Weinstein's long history of sexual harassment and assault has finally been broken, allegations about other rich and famous Hollywood figures are starting to build. On the heels of Hilarie Burton's disclosure that Ben Affleck had groped them in 2003—for which they recently apologized on Twitter but without tagging Burton—Annamarie Tendler, a makeup artist and author, has stepped forward with a similar story. Tendler tweeted that she'd also like an apology from Affleck for having groped them at a 2014 Golden Globes party, which they tried to play off.

Tendler, who's married to comedian John Mulaney, wrote that “like most women in these situations,” they kept quiet, though she's thought about what they would say to Affleck. The actor has yet to issue an apology to Tendler.

One of the surprises during Marvel's Comic-Con 2016 panel was a tease for Spider-Man: Homecoming. The film is an unprecedented collaboration between Sony Pictures—which owns the rights to the Spider-Man character—and Marvel Studios, as the two came together to craft the best possible Spider-Man reboot they could. The deal sees Marvel taking the creative lead on the project and including the Spider-Man character as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and while the film is still a year off from release, Marvel—with director Jon Watts and star Tom Holland in tow—debuted the very first footage to eager fans at Comic-Con.
Shortly after dropping the footage, Collider's own Steve Weintraub got a chance to speak briefly with Watts backstage. The filmmaker discussed the oddity of showing off footage while they're still smack dab in the middle of shooting, and also talked about the new design for the film's villain, Vulture, played by Michael Keaton. Watts teased that they wanted to differentiate the character from previous Spider-Man films, which is why they decided on a much more tech-based costume rather than something organic.
Watch the video interview above and check out a time index of topics discussed below. Spider-Man: Homecoming opens in theaters on July 7, 2017 and also stars Zendaya, Tony Revolori, Angourie Rice, Abraha Attah, Marisa Tomei, Martin Starr, and Robert Downey Jr.
England v Republic of Ireland
Venue: Wembley Date: Wednesday, 29 May Kick-off: 2000 BST Coverage: Listen to full commentary on BBC Radio 5 live; text commentary on BBC Sport website
Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole will captain England for Wednesday night's friendly with the Republic of Ireland in recognition of reaching 100 caps.
There had been initial confusion over who would be skippered, but Cole has been selected in Steven Gerrard's absence.
England's 100-cap club Peter Shilton (125)
David Beckham (115)
Bobby Moore (108)
Bobby Charlton (106)
Billy Wright (105)
Steven Gerrard (101)
Ashley Cole (101)
Hodgson said: "He has been a fantastic servant, not just for Arsenal and Chelsea but for England as well."
Cole's honour comes just months after they used an expletive on Twitter to describe the Football Association.
The defender was fined £90,000 in October 2012 for their offensive tweet in response to the FA's judgement in the John Terry racism case. They subsequently deleted the comments and apologised personally to FA chairperson David Bernstein.
The incident occurred after Cole's evidence to an independent FA commission - which found Terry guilty of racially insulting Anton Ferdinand during a match between Chelsea and QPR in October 2011 - was called into question.
Cole will be making their 102nd appearance for England at Wembley on Wednesday having become the seventh player to reach a century of caps, against Brazil, in February.
The Republic visit Wembley for the first time since 1991 as part of the FA's 150th anniversary celebrations, a schedule that also includes a game in Brazil on Sunday.
Hodgson had caused confusion over who would wear the armband by earlier referring to Frank Lampard's regular role as vice-captain.
Media playback is not supported on this device Cole a fantastic servant - Hodgson
"Frank and I are happy that [Cole] will lead the team out but Frank still remains the captain of the team," said Hodgson.
The FA later clarified Hodgson's comments and insisted to BBC Sport that Cole would be skippered throughout the game.
Lampard said: "The way they have performed, they have been the most consistent left-back in world football. The gesture is very much deserved and I am very happy for him."
Meanwhile, Hodgson has written to England supporters urging them to avoid any religious or political chants at Wembley.
Crowd trouble marred the last match between England and the Republic of Ireland 18 years ago.
"It's very important," Hodgson said. "It almost goes without saying that you want fans to respect the opposition and I'm hoping that happens, because Wednesday night is such an important part of the FA's celebrations and I hope our fans are going to come and cheer us to victory.
Media playback is not supported on this device Lampard happy to hand Cole captaincy
"I was very happy to send out the letter to try to make sure that the game is played in the right spirit, as I know it will be on the field.
"I hope the fans, and the Irish fans, show the level of respect that we would expect for a game of this type.
"I'm looking forward to it very much. Not only have the Republic of Ireland got a fantastic record, but they've reached major tournaments and have shown they're a difficult team for any opponent.
"I think it's very fitting that we now play one of the other home nations and we know we're going into the kind of quality game that will help us prepare for our important games in October."
So after the big release of sequential control in October, Novembers release is less focussed on features and more on under the hood changes, although there have been a few new functions added
For the most part though, November is a stability and bug fix release, with heaps of patches included. Many of these are around sequential (and a big thanks goes out to Dan Elliot for testing throughout November!) but there were also improvements made to a number of decoders, overdwell protection etc.
As far as new features go however, the big one is that flex fuel sensing and adjustment is now supported. This allows for reading from a standard frequency based flex fuel sensor and adjusting the mixture accordingly. The great thing about the standard GM/Continental sensor is that is requires no calibration and so tuning of fuel requirements is largely universal. The default settings included in the base tune will work in almost all cases.
This feature does need some documentation to be written up, which I'll do over the next few weeks, but the support is there and working from this month onwards.
Giveaway!
Finally, many of you will have seen that there is a poll up to vote on a new logo concept. Just incase getting to have a say in the new logo isn't enough incentive (how could it not be!?!) I've decided to add an extra reason to vote....
Once voting closes on Dec 16th, the final logo will be put together based on the results. At that point I'll be choosing 1 person who voted, at random and they will receive a t-shirt and bumper sticker with the new logo from the first round to get printed! This competition is open to all users who have made at least 1 post on the forum at the time voting closes.
Note that the shirts and stickers will take a few weeks to get printed once things are final, so don't expect your winnings before Christmas or anything.
There have been a couple of additions to the voting options recently and everyone can adjust their vote right up to the 16th, so even if you've already voted, take another look and have your say! https://speeduino.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=890

Release notes
The full list of changes included in this months firmware is below:
Google has been granted a patent for a wearable that rests on a single ear and wraps around the head to offer a display in front of the user's eye. It's possible that that it could be the beginnings of the second-generation Google Glass.
The patent describes the wearable as being capable of retaining its configuration, so it stays in a shape the user is comfortable with. The band can also double as a touch-based input surface.
Google's new patent describes a Glass-style wearable that fits on one ear
It also mentions how a single display could be used with a prism or or other structure configured to extend over both eyes of the user for displaying an image viewable by both eyes.”
Google shut down public sales of Glass in January and put Nest CEO Tony Fadell in charge of the program. In July it was reported that Glass would be repurposed as an enterprise device in fields like healthcare and air travel.
In September, Google hired engineers from Amazon's Lab126, its hardware research arm, to work on a wearable known as Project Aura. It's believed that this is the new incarnation of the Glass project.

The world of ‘Drag' culture is something foreign to many people. I want to shed light on this unique community of talented artists in the next installment for my Stories of Sexuality and Gender series.
Nina Flowers was born Jorge Luis Flores S?nchez.?He is a makeup artist, DJ, activist, and is best known for being a contestant on the inaugural season of Rupaul's Drag Race.
For those that may be unfamiliar, Rupaul is a legendary pioneer for the LGBT community, becoming famous for their beautiful appearance as a Drag Queen, and their bubbly and endearing personality. This reality show has become quite a success for the LOGO channel which is geared towards the LGBT and ally audience. Nina Flowers helped catapult the show into stardom, becoming one of its most talked about and intriguing figures. I had the great opportunity of interviewing Ms. Flowers recently.
Me: Ms. Flowers. Could you tell everyone where you were born and raised?
Ms. Flowers: I was born and raised in the city of Bayam?n, in the beautiful island of Puerto Rico.
Me: When did you first realize you were “different” as far as your sexual orientation and also your interest in women's impersonation? Did one revelation come first?
Ms. Flowers: I knew I was gay at a very young age, and even before I became a teenager.??My interest in the art of transformation started when I was 19 years old.
Me: Could you describe for everyone what you would say the difference is between being a Drag Queen and being transgender or transsexual?
Ms. Flowers: In my opinion ‘Drag' is an art form, and being Transgendered is someone that's born and to a degree trapped in a different gender than how they truly identify, with Tran-sexuality being someone that has completed the process of changing their sex.
Me: Carmen Carrera has made a lot of attention because of their transition from female impersonator to being a woman on a daily basis now. Do you think there's a place in the ‘Drag' community for women who have transitioned? Why or why not?
Ms. Flowers: As a whole and if meant to be inclusive, I don't?really believe it should be called the ‘Drag' community, but rather an entertainer? community. In my opinion, any individual who goes through the process of gender change is no longer considered a Drag Queen. However, at the end of the day Carmen Carrera started as an entertainer, and they remain in the field of entertainment.
Me: How did your Puerto Rican roots play a role in your LGBT experience? Did you ever feel more pressure to hide who you were because of your family/background/etc?
Ms. Flowers: The Machismo in the Latino culture is very intense. There is definitely a lot of pressure. I personally struggled a lot during my adolescence trying to hide my true identity in order to avoid being bullied and rejected by others. As for my family, I am very lucky to have a family that loved me and supported me from day one!
Me: You have made friends with a lot of fellow Drag Queens throughout the years. How do you think your experiences have been shaped by being a double minority (LGBT and Puerto Rican) in the United States? In comparison to your white LGBT counterparts?
Ms. Flowers: I think it has been to my advantage because I have turned every relationship into a cultural experience. I've learned from others and in turn I let others learn from me. I've never placed myself in a box as a minority.??I am what I am without labels.
Me: You were famously a contestant on season 1 of Rupaul's Drag Race. Rupaul and the show has received some criticism for its common use of terms like “bitch” and “c–t” and other things that some may see as degrading, especially towards females. How do you respond to this? Is this just an acceptable part of ‘Drag' culture?
Ms. Flowers: Words are just words! It really depends on the power a person decides to place upon those words.??In my opinion harm, is created and dependent on the tone and situation on how the words are used.
Me: How has ‘Drag' culture changed since you first started performing? Do you think it has become more acceptable to the mainstream?
Ms. Flowers: We have come a long way.??It has evolved tremendously and I believe it's definitely way more acceptable!
Me: If you could tell the general public who may not know a lot about ‘Drag Life', one thing, what would it be?
Ms. Flowers: ‘Drag' is Art. We do what we do to entertain the masses. If you have never given yourself the chance to go to one of our shows, you don't know what you're missing.??Make up, wigs, costumes, acting, and dancing; when you put them all together we create magic. 😉
Ms. Flowers has been in the business for a long time. The evolving dynamic of the ‘Drag' community has been a beautiful thing. More draq queens have woven their way into the media and become loved by millions. There is still much discussion surrounding performers like Ms. Flowers, and then the people who struggle everyday with being transgender and transsexual. It is different, but there are similarities. Dealing with not being accepted, intolerance, ignorance, and sometimes violence, can make life very difficult for people who step outside the socially constructed gender norms. Through Drag and shows like Rupaul's Drag Race, these minorities can have a voice; we begin to see more of them and subsequently, we love them! Thank you to Ms. Flowers for their time and for helping to make ‘Drag' so popular. Oh, and I definitely agree with their last sentiments; if you haven't gone to a Drag Show, you should! It is an eye-opening and highly entertaining experience!

As the Arctic melts and tensions rise with NATO, the Russian navy is changing doctrine and expanding its reach globally.
The Russian navy is pivoting towards the Atlantic and the Arctic in order to take advantage of melting ice and blunt what Russia considers to be NATO expansionism toward Russian borders. The change in Russia's naval doctrine (.pdf) was announced by President Putin in a 2015 announcement from Russia's strategic port at Kaliningrad, in Eastern Europe. The new strategy encompasses:
Bulking up the Black Sea fleet based in Crimea and the Baltic fleet in Kaliningrad
Building new airfields and radar bases along an extended arc along Russia's Arctic region
Creating protected sea lane routes for a commercial shipping lane- a northern passage – from Europe to Asia
Russian naval presence on a “permanent basis” in the Mediterranean
Corvette Cruise Missiles
During the Syrian war, Russia surprised military experts by launching 1000-mile cruise missile strikes against Syrian targets from Corvette ships located in the Caspian Sea. The ships, loaded with Kalibr cruise missiles, are small (Russia corvettes can be under 1000 tons) and enable Russia to project force far inland- a task that has become the pinnacle of naval ambitions for navies across the world.
Kalibr cruise missiles can be loaded with nuclear munitions or conventional explosives.
Russian Submarines
Russia has about 45 attack submarines designed to hunt and destroy enemy ships. According to a top US Navy commander, in 2015 Russian submarine patrols increased 50%, with many new patrols in the Atlantic.
The increase in Atlantic patrols comes at a time when Russian naval efforts are also also expanding to Arctic areas where ice is melting and new claims to natural resources are being made. Russia is also investing in new icebreakers, though not part of their navy.
Like their Corvettes in the Caspian, Russian subs can launch the Kalibr land-attack cruise missile, as Russia successfully demonstrated off the coast of Syria in 2015. Overall, Russian subs today are:
quieter
better armed
better trained crews
Russia's sub activities are part of a larger global trend that is seeing many countries compete to build more and better subs. New ways to hunt subs down, including autonomous AI technology, are also being tested.
Russian Navy And The Mediterranean
When it annexed Crimea in 2014, Russia regained a historic port to boost it's access to warm water via the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Crimea had been Russian until 1954, when it was given to Ukraine SovietRepublic as a gift. The Sevastopol naval port in Crimea is the center of activities to counter NATO ambitions in the Black Sea.
There also the Russian-leased port in Tartus, Syria, which is being upgraded to house additional Russian ships, subs and Russia's aircraft carrier.
The Russian navy can also sail out of a leased port in Cypress, Greece.

This had global consequences - the disappearance of one quarter of the world market is not an easy event to deal with - and almost caused the bankruptcy of several turbines manufacturers (some were bought out). Ever since, manufacturers have probably undersized their investments, in order to be able to deal with such a potential drop in demand, and they mostly avoided the US as a production base as a result, even though there are serious logistical advantages in this (heavy) industry to be located near your market.
There is no secret: the only way to have manufacturing investment in an industry which needs no subsidies, but a specific regulatory framework is to have stable policies and, dare I say it, an industrial policy to promote both the wind industry (a good thing in itself) and the wind turbine manufacturing industry.
This is still missing, right now. States are doing this at the local level, but it would make a lot of sense to do it at the federal level.
A day after they found themselves in a soup over hiding ownership of a land from the Election Commission Maharashtra Minister for Water Resources Girish Mahajan on Monday said that they did not even remember when they purchased the 4.97 acre piece of land.
The Congress, on Sunday, had alleged that Mahajan did not mention the ownership of the land in their election affidavits in 2004, 2009 and 2014. The records show that Mahajan had purchased the land at Manpur in Bhusawal taluka of Jalgaon district in 2002 allegedly at a price of Rs 20 lakh per acre.
"I don't even remember when I purchased it," Mahajan told India Today on Monday at their office in Mantralaya. "I only recall that some people had approached me in 1999 to make me director of a sugar factory. They had purchased 100 acres of land. Out of which 50 acres was purchased by a family of four for their personal use. They had asked me to sign several papers. I don't even remember whether I had signed the papers or not," they said.
They claimed that there could not be any record of their presence at the registration office because the land registration used to be done without photographs of the seller and the buyer in those days.
"I recall the price of the land was Rs 1.11 lakh at that time not Rs 20 lakh per acre as being alleged. I am also surprised to see how someone has brought forward the said land transaction I don't remember," Mahajan said.
Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant has demanded that the election commission should take stringent action against Mahajan for concealing property in their subsequent election affidavits.
Mahajan is the second BJP leader after Eknath Khadse whose name has cropped in a controversy over a land deal. Khadse had resigned as revenue minister on June 4 following the allegation of conflict of interest while deciding the compensation amount for a land their wife Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Choudhary had purchased at Bhosari near Pune on April 27.
Mahajan, known as a close confidant of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, has emerged as a powerful leader in Jalgaon after Khadse's exit. Interestingly, when social activists had raised question why Khadse had not disclosed ownership of land worth of Rs 137 crore in Jalgaon they had retorted, "Why do you ask about my land only. They (Mahajan) also has not disclosed ownership of their land in the affidavit. Why don't you ask the same question to him?"
Ukraine has been shorn of Crimea, now there is talk of splitting the rest of the country in two, rather as Czechoslovakia did in 1993. But do the arguments add up?
The argument for splitting Ukraine is that this would merely establish de jure a situation that already exists de facto, because Ukraine is deeply divided by its cultural identity/language differences. It would also supposedly settle tensions between the West and Russia because Moscow would get what it wanted and would not venture further. With Ukraine split into two, its western part could eventually move closer towards Europe while its Russian-speaking East and South would establish a state allied closely with Russia. This solution, the argument goes, would best reflect the preferences of the local population. Moreover, letting parts of the South and East go might also be sensible for economic reasons. The only problem with this proposal is that none of the arguments bear close scrutiny.
How important is language?
Ukraine's linguistic divisions are real. The majority of the country's Russian-speaking population lives in the East and South; most of those who speak Ukrainian live in the centre and the West, which has traditionally been more integrated with the rest of Europe for reasons of both geography and history. But is one's mother tongue the strongest factor influencing one's political choices? When sociologists pose questions relating to their respondents' identity, history or preference for a pro-EU or a pro-Russian foreign policy, the result is indeed a political map of Ukraine where the western and central regions exhibit very different preferences from those in the East and South.
Ukraine's linguistic divisions are real.
But as Ukrainian political scientist Yevhen Hlibovytsky argues, research suggests that for ordinary Ukrainians there are other issues which are far more important for their political choices than language. These are mostly associated with their own security: economic security, rule of law, education or human security. When sociologists ask questions about these issues, the result is a map of political preferences which does not reflect geographical or linguistic divisions – it presents a picture of a relatively united country.
While there is some correlation between predominantly Russian-speaking parts of Ukraine and pro-Russian foreign policy preferences, language is not, in fact, the most important predictor of separatist sentiments. As American historian Timothy Snyder argues, ‘It is true that Ukrainians speak Russian, but that does not make them Russian, any more than my writing in English makes me English.' Many Ukrainians are bilingual and speaking Russian is not the main indicator of their choices.
If language was the main deciding factor, French-speaking parts of Belgium would have joined France long ago.
Moreover, having a preference for stronger ties with Russia does not equate to wishing to become a part of the Russian state – if language were the main deciding factor, the French-speaking parts of Belgium would have split off and joined France long ago. Also, language does not seem to be the main factor in people's attitudes to the political protests that swept Yanukovych from power: 15.6% of EuroMaidan participants spoke only Russian and 24% spoke both Russian and Ukrainian. In short, media reports, western and others, which picture Ukraine as a deeply divided, almost artificial state, are off the mark, focusing on divisions which play a much smaller role in the country's political life than it appears.
Do Ukrainians want their country to split?
The same goes for the EuroMaidan movement, which was and still is often misinterpreted by many as a simple fight between those who support Ukraine's pro-European orientation and those who do not (or favour closer ties with Russia). This simplistic view misses the point not only articulated by the leaders of the movement but backed by research carried out among those who took part in the protests. EuroMaidan's main objective was to change Ukraine's system of governance and rid it of corruption. On the streets, these goals were supported equally by people from the western and the southern and eastern parts of Ukraine (according to a poll in early February, 44% of participants in the Kyiv protests came from the Russian-speaking South or East).
There is a regional divide when it comes to how the EuroMaidan is seen by the broader population – it has much more support in the West and the Centre than in the East. But, as I explained above, these have little to do with linguistic divisions and are partly a question of political culture and greater exposure to Russian media.
Local support for splitting from Ukraine or joining another state doesn't go above 16 % in any of Ukraine's regions.
The argument for splitting Ukraine along western/central and southern/eastern lines has little to do with either real divisions in the country or popular preferences. A recent poll by Kyiv's Razumkov Centre think tank clearly shows that local public support for splitting from Ukraine or joining another state doesn't go above 16 % in any of Ukraine's regions. Until the Russian invasion of Crimea, the issue of separatism was simply absent from public debate – for comparison, in the run-up to the peaceful split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech and Slovak political elites both blamed the other nationality for the federal state's economic, social and political problems. Such attitudes are not part of Ukraine's mainstream political debate today. There is undeniable distrust of the interim government in different parts of Ukraine, which was further inflamed by the (subsequently suspended) move to annul the 2012 Language Law that enhanced the status of Russian and other minority languages. Yet none of the mainstream Ukrainian media or political parties are interested in vilifying one or other part of the country.
A ‘shared neighbourhood': the idea of ‘Europe' and post-Soviet realities
The second argument – that the splitting of Ukraine would finally mean the end of the more than two decades-long contest between the West and Russia for their ‘shared neighbourhood', is mere wishful thinking. As Bulgarian political scientist Ivan Krastev writes, Russia's actions in Ukraine are about far more than Moscow reclaiming its former dominion: if the West ‘gives up on' Ukraine, the danger is that Russia's appetite will only increase – what guarantee is there that if Belarus decided to loosen its relations with Moscow, Russia would not intervene? By occupying part of Ukraine, Russia sends out a signal that its borders are open to question.
Despite the country's complex history and regional divergences, the wish to pursue European integration has been a unifying, and not a dividing factor in Ukraine. The idea of ‘Europe' has come to symbolise good governance, high quality healthcare, good education and general high living standards. According to a poll conducted by DW-Trend in 2013, only 31% of people in Eastern Ukraine were opposed to EU accession. There is also a generation gap: 67% of younger people support closer ties with the EU. And a recent nation-wide poll revealed that while Ukrainians would prefer not to have a visa regime or customs border with Russia, only 12 % of them would want their country to unite with Russia. The highest level of support for unification is in Eastern Ukraine, but it is still only 26 %.
The wish to pursue European integration has been a unifying, and not a dividing factor in Ukraine.
The existence of fine degrees of ethnic divergence, with different parts of Ukraine not sharing historical memory and language, has not resulted in a public vote for separatism. Given the context of economic difficulties, social upheaval and one-sided media propaganda in some regions, it is not surprising that there are tensions and signs of discontent. However, splitting Ukraine would not just fail to resolve these tensions – it could exacerbate the crisis. Having a mix of ethnic Ukrainians living in some regions with a large population of ethnic Russians may make it difficult to opt for a ‘velvet divorce', as the Czech and Slovak political elites once did.
What Ukraine needs now is democratic reform and a complete overhaul of governance that would allow it to make up for its stalled transition – rather than looking through the prism of division, it can turn its different languages and varied political aspirations and cultures from a weakness into a strength. This would not only consolidate the Ukrainian state but it would send a strong signal to Moscow that a multi-linguistic and diverse country can be ruled democratically.
NRL clubs have been left to count a huge cost after a brutal opening weekend to the 2016 season, with several of the game's biggest and brightest names now facing long stints on the sidelines.
And as a direct result of the new interchange reduction, Ricky Stuart says NRL clubs better get used to the reality that injuries and concussion will decide the outcome of games this year.
In one of several round-one knockouts, Stuart could lose their star halves pairing of Blake Austin (knee) and Aidan Sezer (eye) to potential long-term injuries.
Elsewhere in a horror opening round for injuries:
* The Rabbitohs were hit hardest with halfback Adam Reynolds (jaw) and backrower John Sutton (pec) both facing long stints on the sidelines;
* Panthers hooker James Segeyaro broke their arm and faces two months out;
* Bulldogs hooker Michael Lichaa injured their knee, with reports suggesting they could be sidelined for three months;
* Cronulla face a nervous wait as the severity of captain Paul Gallen's knee injury is assessed;
* Luckless Warriors back-rower Ben Henry suffered a likely season-ending dislocated kneecap;
* Broncos flyer Jordan Kahu could miss a month with a thigh injury
* Eels five-eighth Corey Norman was forced off the field during their side's loss to Brisbane with a neck injury.

“I think they will both miss some time, Austo a little bit more,” Stuart said of Austin and Sezer.
“I don't like to say (how long) until I know exactly what the scans show”.
Stuart said they were hoping Sezer's injury was localised to their eye socket, which would mean they could be back in a couple of weeks.
Although Sezer completed the full game on Saturday, Austin only played 46 minutes. Stuart believes reducing the interchange from 10 to eight this year will prove decisive in games.
“I'm not saying it is a bad thing because I like it,” Stuart said.
“But there is going to be games won and lost because of injury and concussions.
“It is a tough gig (deciding when to make changes during a game when players are forced off injured).”

Penrith coach Anthony Griffin agreed, with Segeyaro going off in the early stages of the second half when the Panthers came back to lead 22-16.
“Particularly if you lose a key player like him,” Griffin said.
“I thought it was okay (the interchange changes) but certainly injuries make you have to juggle it a bit more.”
Griffin said Segeyaro would find out on Monday exactly how long they would be sidelined.
“It is terrible for him,” Griffin said.
“He was playing their 100th game and they were going well but that happens.
“We are pretty certain they have some kind of break or displacement. They are just hoping it is a spiral fracture which is six to eight weeks.”

Cronulla received good news on Gallen's injury, but the Sharks skipper still faces up to eight weeks on the sidelines.
Lichaa will also see a specialist on Monday but the fear is the young hooker could be sidelined from anywhere between one and three months.
Former Dragon Craig Garvey is Lichaa's most likely replacement for Thursday night's clash with Penrith.
Garvey played seven games for the Dragons off the bench last year but with limited minutes, 35 being the most in one game.

Parramatta received good news on Corey Norman who was cleared of serious injury and should be back for the game in North Queensland on Saturday night with Kieran Foran also expected to make their NRL debut for the Eels.
The injury to Henry was a shattering blow after they came off in the game against the Wests Tigers.
Andrew McFadden said the diagnosis for the backrower “doesn't look good”.
The 24-year-old also suffered season-ending injuries in 2013 and 2015 and has endured two previous knee reconstructions.

Young Bronco Kahu could also be facing up to a month out after suffering a thigh injury.
Griffin would not speculate on their options for Segeyaro.
The Panthers lost Api Koroisau to Manly this year, while Sione Katoa suffered a medial strain in the Auckland Nines and remains sidelined.
Parramatta recruit Zach Docker-Clay played for Penrith in NSW Cup on the weekend but is still only 20 years of age, while Tyrone Peachey could also make a switch to dummy half, perhaps opening the door for young sensation Te Maire Martin on the bench.
My gift arrived way late, and that got me a little sad but my secret santa did message me a few time explaining to me their colleagues ate my snacks. Now I will admit that sounds like an excuse but who cares in the end, I got them right :).
My gifter mentioned in the accompanying letter that they hoped they had sent me stuff I couldn't find in the Netherlands. That almost worked out, since we do have Kettle Chips here. In fact, we do have a lot of famous chips here in a lot of variaties, I don't think the US will beat us there by much.
I also got two bags of Chicharonnes. Now I didn't know what those were, but they seem to be deep fried pig skins with some sugar, salt and spice added. To be honest they took a LOT of getting used to, but after one whole bag I can say I'm beginning to like them. This is nothing like I've ever tasted here and I don't know if it can even be bought here, a truly unique taste of the US indeed.

Police in Japan have raided the homes of a 67-year-old Japanese woman arrested on suspicion of poisoning their husband, as details of six former partners' deaths emerge in local media.
The raids on Chisako Kakehi's homes come a day after they were detained.
An autopsy on their 75-year-old husband, who died in December 2013 weeks after their wedding, had found traces of cyanide in their blood.
Police are also looking into the 2012 death of a previous partner.
Police visited Ms Kakehi's homes in Kyoto and Osaka on Thursday, where they confiscated capsules and wafers to wrap powdered medicine, as well as books on drugs.
News outlets said Ms Kakehi had met their husband named Isao, who had a life insurance policy, through a matchmaking service. They were their fourth husband.
'Proceeding carefully'
Besides Isao's death, police are also investigating the 2012 death of Ms Kakehi's 71-year-old then partner, who collapsed while riding a motorbike.
Investigators found cyanide in their blood sample, said Kyodo. Their death was initially attributed to heart disease.
Ms Kakehi's previous three husbands and three boyfriends were reportedly aged between 54 and 75 when they died.
Each death allegedly took place within a few years of marrying or starting relationships with them
Following Isao's death, Ms Kakehi began a relationship with another 75-year-old man. They died in September after falling ill, following a meal with Ms Kakehi at a restaurant, according to Jiji Press.
AFP news agency reported that police are now working on a theory that they had a hand in the deaths of their previous partners.
"We can't say how many now... Given their advanced age, we have to proceed carefully to judge whether their deaths were actually the result of foul play or not," said the investigator.
Media reports have linked Ms Kakehi's partners' deaths to hefty insurance payouts, with one news outlet saying they had received hundreds of millions of yen over the past two decades.
But Ms Kakehi has denied such accusations, and had earlier said they were simply "doomed by fate" to suffer a series of deaths.
"If people suspect murder, I'd find it easier to bite my tongue off and die," they told reporters in March.
Robbing Peter to pay Paul is never a good thing. But that's what's going on in Houston's growing and competitive restaurant-workforce marketplace.
Across the board - from fine dining to ultra casual - restaurants are hiring from the same pool, both for positions in the kitchen and front of the house. Now more than ever, the quest for workers has reached a critical point as dozens of restaurants are on the board to debut ahead of Super Bowl LI.
"We saw this coming a year or two ago," said Jonathan Horowitz, president of the Greater Houston Restaurant Association. "There's just not enough labor to go around - certainly qualified labor in the higher-end, more full-service restaurants. … And there's no sign of it letting up."
On the flip side, it's a fine time to work in the industry. "If you've got a good résumé in fine dining and you have good references," said Michael Fulmer, a career waiter who recently joined the team at Killen's STQ, "you definitely have some good options right now."
Dominick Lee knew there would be a lot of chef opportunities in Houston when they began looking for a new job last year. But they specifically sought out chef Kiran Verma, who was planning to open their namesake Indian restaurant in a new location. With kitchen credentials from both the Besh and Brennan restaurant groups in New Orleans, they likely could have worked anywhere here.
"There are a lot of cool things going on in Houston right now," the 28-year-old Kiran's executive sous chef said.
The demand for restaurant workers outpaces supply in Houston, industry watchers say. The competition has forced establishments to get creative and invest in various strategies to lure potential staff.
Yauatcha, a restaurant set to open in the Galleria in March from international hospitality powerhouse Hakkasan Group, was so intent on finding qualified staff that it held a three-day job fair in December to fill about 120 positions (it's holding another in February). The original Yauatcha, which opened in London in 2004, earned a Michelin star in 2005; this will be the second U.S. outpost of the modern Chinese dim sum teahouse known for sophisticated design, exacting service and a menu of Chinese dumplings and European patisserie goods.
Hakkasan, which has a sizable presence in Las Vegas, felt the job fair was an essential step for getting acquainted with the level of Houston's workforce. "The market is not as abundant here as Las Vegas" in terms of a ready talent pool, said Yannick Augy, director of restaurant projects. "We are a company that believes in raw talent."
Job fairs are one method restaurant operators are employing to attract workers. Outreach pop-ups at local universities, referral bonuses, employee perks (extended benefits, vacation time and cellphone allowances) and social media strategies are at play as well.
"People at this point are doing anything and everything they possibly can to attract qualified candidates," Horowitz said.
Chris Tripoli, a principal at Houston-based A La Carte Foodservice Consulting Group, said that simply hanging out a "help wanted" sign doesn't cut it any longer. In the past couple of years, restaurants have become more savvy on social media by positioning their businesses as good places to work and advance.
Training and staff development are being expanded, too, Tripoli said. "It's not just hiring but an ongoing focus about keeping them engaged and keeping them developed so they're not going elsewhere," they said. "The more staff feels comfortable and the more they learn about the industry, the more confident they are in their jobs."
Some operators are filling their staffing needs by traditional methods of promoting in house and by staff referrals. Hugo Ortega and Tracy Vaught said many of the new workers for their upcoming Xochi restaurant at the Marriott Marquis Hotel are coming from within their existing workforce; likewise, The Breakfast Klub owner Marcus Davis, who soon will open Kulture at the George R. Brown Convention Center, said many referrals are coming from their staff.
Other restaurateurs are concerned not just about finding workers but finding the right workers. "What restaurants are going to have to do is rely on developing really good training programs, as opposed to having someone come in off the street with good credentials," said Adam Dorris, chef/partner in the upcoming Presidio restaurant in the Heights.
"It's going to be a difficult task to find good, consistent people in the kitchen," said Ryan Hildebrand, chef/owner of Triniti restaurant, who soon will open FM Burger in the Heights. "This business is very transient in nature. People are always shuffling around. It's always been a challenge. In the last three years or so, it's been really difficult to get a staff together."
Chris Shepherd, chef/owner of Underbelly, said they need about 75 workers for their new One Fifth restaurant opening this month in Montrose.
"Staffing is always a difficult thing. I don't know if it's just because of the Super Bowl, but people are moving around, shifting and changing," Shepherd said. "You see a buyer's market for homes, and now there's a waitstaff market. They can pick and choose."
Though they have not found all the staff they need for One Fifth, Shepherd said he's confident he'll fill the spots. And that certainty may stem from advance buzz about One Fifth making their high-profile restaurant a desirable place to work.
Still, there are plenty of restaurants that might find themselves competing for the same workers. Soon-to-open restaurants include Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen and Bud's Pitmaster BBQ at the convention center; Potente and Osso & Kristalla at 500 Crawford downtown; Kiran's in Upper Kirby; Brasseri du Parc at One Park Place downtown; Field & Tides in the Heights; Bosscat Kitchen & Libations in River Oaks; Bernie's Burger Bus in the Heights; and Bayou & Bottle at the Four Seasons Hotel Houston. They will join a slew of just-opened restaurants, including Killen's STQ, Local Foods Downtown, Beaver's Westheimer, Pinkerton's Barbecue, Night Market, Grotto, Biggio's and Walker Street Kitchen at the Marriott Marquis Houston, Agu Ramen, Riel and Bebidas.
But what happens after the Super Bowl pulls out of town?
There might be some inevitable closings, Tripoli said. "The restaurants that aren't unique and different may be the casualties," they said. "The more average or common operations will get a good spike when the Super Bowl is in town. After the Super Bowl, they may be wondering how to make it."
Even so, Horowitz doesn't predict a downturn in the Houston restaurant market. There will still be plenty of new restaurants opening, they said, and with that the need for workers.
"It's not slowing down just because it's tough to find workers," they said. "It's just another challenge in the restaurant business. And there are many."

A new translation of the Quran, with commentary, is causing a stir—and maybe something of a revolution—in the world of English-speaking Muslims.
Why's that? Because Salafists—adherents of a very conservative brand of Islam—have dominated the world market for Qurans for decades.
Funded by the oil-rich royal family in Saudi Arabia, which has an especially rigid Wahhabi branch of Islam, the Salafis have exported their teachers, their mosques, their audio and video productions, and religious texts across the Arab world and into Pakistan, Europe, and North America, quashing alternate interpretations that don't fit their narrow views.
“In all these places, they funded the building of Saudi-style mosques with Wahhabi preachers and established madrasas that provided free education for the poor, with, of course, a Wahhabi curriculum,” religious scholar Karen Armstrong wrote about the Saudi export of religion in 2014. “At the same time, young men from the poorer Muslim countries, such as Egypt and Pakistan, who had felt compelled to find work in the Gulf to support their families, associated their relative affluence with Wahhabism and brought this faith back home with them, living in new neighborhoods with Saudi mosques and shopping malls that segregated the sexes.”
Seeing this new translation as a challenge to their orthodoxy in English-speaking countries, Salafis are none too pleased. In online discussions and reviews, influential Salafis are panning the volume, called The Study Quran, as a soft-bellied facsimile that might be fine for academia, but not fit for following.
In fact, this is no mere academic debate. Followers of the Saudi-Wahhabi-Salafi version of Islam in Europe and the United States are increasingly seen by law enforcement as a pool from which radical jihadis can draw recruits.
Some strains of this Salafi interpretation have popularized takfirism—the practice by which some Muslims declare that others are not true believers. The aftereffects are clear in fringe jihadi groups like the self-declared caliphate that calls itself the Islamic State, where those who believe differently are deemed apostates who can be, and are, slaughtered en masse. The vast majority of Salafis are not jihadis and not takfiris. But those who are use their understanding of their Quran to justify killing Shia Muslims, Yazidis, adulterers, gays, and anyone else who runs afoul of their zealotry.
Generations of the world's Muslims have, now, grown up in the shadow of this Saudi religious empire, ignoring previous centuries of rigorous religious discourse, debate, and dissent.
The Study Quran, setting the record straight, may come as something of a revelation to Muslims and anyone else interested in Islam who speaks English. It is a formidable academic endeavor, and since it was published in November it has been flying off the shelves in a massive hardback edition. (It is also available now on Kindle.)
The editors have compiled a new translation, new commentary, and drawn on dozens of the most prominent mufassirs (interpreters or exegetes), many of whom have never before been accessible to an English-speaking audience. Indeed, “very few” of the sources cited in The Study Quran are available in English translation, head editor Seyyed Hossein Nasr told The Daily Beast.
One soon comes across nuances that are unmentioned or ignored by extremists. The Study Quran notes, for instance, that verse 47:4—used by ISIS to justify beheadings—focuses on “the brevity of the act, as it is confined to battle and not a continuous command.” This interpretation would seem to challenge extremists who attempt to carry out such acts on civilians, whether on the streets of London or in Syria.
The Salafi scholars who have monopolized English-language Muslim resources are disturbed and even frightened by this textual revolution that puts them back in their place.
Salafism “was not in the mainstream of the Muslim tradition,” said Nasr. “It rejected centuries of Islamic thought.” The scholars contributing to The Study Quran, who are both Sunni and Shia, also break with the ultra-Orthodox animus against Shiism.
The Study Quran's rich commentary, crowding around a few verses on any given onion-paper page of the hardback edition, seeks to remedy the previous absence of solid historical discourse. After all, Nasr said, even centuries ago the yearly pilgrimage to Mecca meant that exegetes, or interpreters of holy texts, were able to have a much richer exchange of ideas—and much more knowledge of one another—than European thinkers of the time.
It's no surprise then, that Abu Eesa Niamatullah—a British Salafi with a large social media presence—cautioned followers tempted by The Study Quran to “avoid it. Like the plague.”
“It doesn't just have mistakes, it's actually dangerous,” Niamatullah said. “This is advice to the 99 percent of people here, those who don't have the detailed tools necessary to separate the wheat from the chaff.”
Though Sunni Islam formally lacks a clerical class, Niamatullah expressed concern that those who lack proper religious or academic training might be swayed from the orthodox path by the new edition.
“My point being that I see it as absolutely a threat to orthodox Sunni creed that such translations and commentaries, but more importantly, such deviated individuals such as Nasr being given a prominent platform to the hearts and minds of the basic masses who can't filter through the nonsense like you can,” they added in a comment.
A more moderate review, recommended by prominent cleric Yasir Qadhi to hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, acknowledges that the rigor of The Study Quran “is apparent after even a cursory reading,” but nonetheless it “is an academic and educational work, and as such includes commentaries from sources that may not be considered orthodox depending on one's denominational orientation.” (Qadhi recently distanced themselves from the Salafi label and critiqued some aspects of the movement.)
“Some of the Sufi commentaries can come off as uncomfortably esoteric,” the author Mobeen Vaid writes. “Khārijite positions are occasionally expounded upon, and not for the purpose of refutation.” (Kharijites were a rebel sect in the first century of of Islam.)
The differences that make it suitable for academia but not practice go all the way down to the understanding of the very nature of the Quran. “For believers,” says Vaid. “the Quran doesn't say anything, God does.”
And yet, The Study Quran fills part of what some scholars see as a perpetual hole in the study of Islam. Quranic translations abound, but centuries of commentary, debate, and context have long been the exclusive domain of those with a strong command of Arabic.
"We appear to be amidst a deluge of English translations of the Quran," Scott Lucas, a professor at the University of Arizona, wrote in 2014, reflecting on the proliferation of translations in the prior decade.
Pretty much any Quran given out in a da'wa, or religious outreach, program almost anywhere in the world has its roots in Saudi Arabia. Most of them use a translation completed by Yusuf Ali, an Indian-born, British-educated scholar who died in the mid-20th century. Published in 1938, it included not only Ali's translation, but also parenthetical commentary on meaning—much of which has been stripped out by its Salafi adapters.
The first Quran ever owned by this reporter was an Ali translation, distributed through a Chelsea-based da'wa program to a bank teller, who unloaded it to this student of religion when they were still a teen. The thick hardcover has the scripture in two varieties: the original Arabic, as well as an English translation.
(Significantly, The Study Quran, already voluminous, does not include the original Arabic, the language in which Allah delivered their message to Muhammad. But the Arabic text is now readily available online and in many smaller volumes for comparison.)
Ali wasn't the first translator of the Quran into English, of course. One of the earliest widely available translations was by George Sale, and it served as the standard for nearly two centuries. It's rife with annotations that point to Sale's Christian understanding of the “Mohammedan's” holy scripture. More recent translations have come from feminists and creative translations that assign each Arabic word one—and only one—English equivalent.
And The Study Quran surely won't be the last. The authors' main goal, after all, is not a definitive translation—but a demonstration that different interpretations were “established, well known, and rigorously discussed over the centuries,” Nasr said.

Yesterday, Palestinians marked Land Day by protesting against the Israeli land confiscations with demonstrations in the West Bank, Gaza, Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan. This year, the protests were also supported by a solidarity campaign known as the Global March to Jerusalem, where Palestinians and allies marched to the Israeli controlled borders of the occupied Palestinians territories. The largest march on the border was in Jordan with between 20,000 and 30,000 protestors, and in Lebanon between 2,000-3,000 marched. In Egypt, the demonstration was cancelled after the state military stopped protestors from joining the march, which would have approached the Rafah crossing with the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli military and police attempted to disperse the protestors, aggressively using crowd dispersal and projectiles, including live ammunition. In Gaza, Israeli fire killed 20-year-old Mahmoud Zakot, and hundreds were injured in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at Israeli forces.
The West Bank
Across the West Bank, demonstrations took place with reports of excessive Israeli force, including water cannons, tear gas and rubber bullets. Additionally, a Long Range Acoustic Device, a sound machine emitting high-frequency noise, and a machine spraying a “skunk” smelling liquid were used on protestors. The Red Crescent counted over 200 people were injured in Qalandia alone, with 85 from rubber bullets. Between 14 and 34 were arrested in Jerusalem, but the total number of arrests is still unknown.
Major protest were held in the cities of Bethlehem, Beit Ummar, Budrus, Jerusalem, Kfar Kadum, Nabi Saleh, Nablus, , Ni'lin, Qalandia, and Safa.

Gaza
Near the Erez crossing in Gaza, Israeli forces used fired water cannons, tear gas and live ammunition into crowds of demonstrating Palestinians, resulting in the death of 20-year-old Mahmoud Zakot. In response, Palestinians threw rocks, burned tires and set fire to an Israeli security tower. Protestors in Gaza also participated in the Global March to Jerusalem.

Israel
In Israel, demonstrators gathered in the Northern villages of Sakhnin, Araba, and Dier Hanna. On Land Day, Sakhnin holds a special significance, as it is the site of the first Land Day protest in 1976. Today, there is a monument in the village by Palestinian artist Abed Abdi, commemorating the six Palestinians who were at the march by killed by Israeli forces

Yes, 8.1 and Cyan are a big leap forwards for this platform, but it has to be said that there's one aspect of Windows Phone that continues to annoy and frustrate just about everyone. The title probably gives the game away - having your user experience ruined by continual loading and resuming messages, interspersed by animated dots.... Happily, things are about to get a lot better, real fast, as I explain below.
If you're in any doubt about what I mean (as if!), the screenshots above should remind you, somewhat forcibly. Back in the 1990s, my Psion palmtop computers ran a full multitasking operating system on a processor as low as 8MHz, several hundred times slower than today's multi-GigaHertz systems and with 500k of RAM, well over a thousand times less dynamic memory than today's Lumias. And I could switch between applications instantly, each popped up on screen with zero delay or wait time.
Most of today's top Android handsets, with modern specifications, at least live up to the same promise - with all your favourite applications shortcutted on your home screen, a tap on each and you're instantly 'there' and instantly productive. As you damn well should be, with such monster resources under the hood.
So how come we have multi-GHz, 1GB or 2GB RAM Lumias leaving you and I hanging around for one or two seconds, maybe fifty times a day? Not only does this all add up, the biggest factor is the frustration at seeing something which should be instant take its own sweet time. While you grind your teeth and wait.
The 8.0 issue
You may have noticed that not all third party applications behave this way - some leap up immediately, as if turbo-boosted. The problem is that most current applications are compiled for Windows Phone 8.0 and its UI guidelines. As a result, many don't work well with the current Windows Phone 8.1's expectation for full support for 'fast resume'. Under 8.1, it's assumed that everything will play nicely with being 'suspended' and then immediately resumed - even if activated from the Start screen or applications list (remember that the 'old' behaviour here was to start a new instance of the app) - and this isn't currently the case.
I looked at 20 or so top current Windows Phone applications, by Microsoft itself and by third parties, and tested* to see which ones were optimised for Windows Phone 8.0 and which for 8.1. (Obviously, 8.0-compiled apps work under 8.1, but not the other way around.**)
Note that I'm simplifying the situation slightly, since there are several ways of building apps for WP 8.1, but these should be transparent to the user.
* in part through the simple expedient of going into the application, then pressing 'back' and seeing if the app is listed in the multitasking carousel - 8.1-optimised applications should be (if coded properly), 8.0-compiled apps are immediately tombstoned and shouldn't.
** developers get round this apparent break in compatibility by using a feature of the Windows Phone Store wherein different builds/versions can be offered to users, depending on OS version.
As you can see, roughly half the top applications are still on '8.0' and/or have yet to be recompiled and optimised for Windows Phone 8.1. Third party developers are either/both:
waiting for more users to be on 8.1 after the Lumia Cyan and similar over-the-air rollouts (we're surely getting up to around 50% right now and will be at 75% within a month or two?)
putting off the recompilation/optimisation, as it will also usually mean maintaining two binaries, one for the older 8.0 and one for 8.1
The end result is that, even with a Lumia Cyan smartphone, pop back to Twitter or Skype or similar, either having pressed 'back' to switch away from them or simply having not used them for a few hours, and there's often the usual annoying 'resuming'-style wait while the OS struggles to resurrect the 8.0-compiled application to full operation. What I'm hoping is that we'll see a rush of updates throughout September and that revisiting a table like this will see far more 'Yes' marks in the right hand table. Along with a faster user experience when jumping from application to application.
All applications should support 'fast app resume', all should work with 8.1's expectation that this mode is enabled and available.
It's also worth noting that the faster, newer phones (e.g. Lumia 1520, 930, HTC One (M8)) reduce the existing delays somewhat, even for 8.0-compiled applications. As does (the Developer Preview of) 8.1 Update 1. In summary, it all helps, and the newer the better.
Developers, it's over to you!
PS. If there are other particular good or bad examples, in terms of applications, then feel free to name and shame in the comments below.
UPDATE: Following some comments (partly justified), we've clarified a few of these concepts in an interview with a knowledgeable developer here.

A transsexual carpenter packed in their business as a successful joiner after becoming a woman - and opening a beauty salon.
Michelle Pindar - born Michael - lived as a man for 38 years before having a sex change, after realising that they were born in the wrong body.
After years of running their own successful kitchen fitting company when they were "Micheal", the 56-year-old packed it all in to open a beauty salon following surgery.
Michelle, from Hull, said: "I loved being a kitchen fitter – I was at the top of my game and the big home improvement stores recommended me to fit all the kitchens they sold.
"But it didn't fit with me when I became a woman.
"I decided I was ready to sell up and look for a new project and that's when I bought the salon.
"Now it's my favourite thing to do to help other women look their best – I'm all about the nails, the hair and the make-up."
(Image: Caters)
Michelle realised at eight years old that they felt more comfortable as a girl than a boy.
"I just had this feeling but I didn't act on it because I hadn't even heard the word transgender or transsexual," they said.
"I did everything I could to be as manly as possible."
(Image: Caters)
Despite knowing something was wrong, they pursued a stereotypically masculine lifestyle expected of them by getting a job in a shipyard, marrying a childhood friend, aged 23, and later opening their own kitchen fitting business.
But 15 years into their marriage, at the age of 38, Michelle, decided to take the plunge and, while pursuing their construction business in the week, they started wearing heels and dresses at weekends.
(Image: Caters)
"It took me a long time but I eventually realised that what I needed to do and I told my wife I needed to start dressing in girls' clothes," they said.
"She handled it well. We couldn't stay together after that but we are still friends."
Four years ago they started dressing as a woman full time and they finally had gender reassignment surgery just under a year ago.
(Image: Caters)
They now run a beauty salon where they work doing waxing, applying semi-permanent make-up and perfecting women's brows, lashes and hair.
They hope to encourage more women into project management and construction having seen the business from both a male and a female perspective.
"Now I've seen it from both sides I can appreciate that people don't take women working in the construction industry seriously at all and I'd love to get back into it one day."

Tea Party hopeful Chris McDaniel lost their Republican primary challenge to six-term Sen. Thad Cochran in Mississippi on June 24. Cochran beat them by about 7,700 votes. On July 7, the state's Republican Party certified Cochran's victory.
Six weeks after the run-off election, McDaniel is having a tough time moving on.
On Monday, McDaniel, a state senator, announced they were formally challenging the results and asking the Mississippi Republican executive committee to declare them the party's nominee in the November general election.
"Justice has no timetable, and yet here we stand," McDaniel, 42, told reporters assembled at a press conference outside their headquarters in Jackson that was somewhat ominously interrupted by thunderclaps and a downpour. "They asked us to put up or shut up, and yet here are. Here we are with the evidence."
Since shortly after the run-off, McDaniel and their team have alleged that Cochran and their "race-baiting" allies stole the election by turning out Democrats who voted illegally in both the Democratic primary and the Republican run-off. The Cochran campaign did appeal to the largely Democratic population of African American voters in the state who were eligible to vote in the G.O.P. run-off if they had not earlier voted in their own party's primary.
A terrorist confesses that they decapitated a person but remains free in Brussels
A Brussels judge refused to place a man in detention even though they have been charged for participating in a terrorist group and that the confessed to having decapitated a person in Syria, report the Belgian newspaper “Het Laatste Nieuws” on Monday.
Iliass Khayari, 25 years of age, confessed the decapitation during a telephone conversation. Het Laatse Nieuws was able to receive the recorded conversation. In it they can be heard saying “It was a heretic”. “We cut off their head.”
Last week, the man was sentenced to five years in prison by a Brussels tribunal. The federal prosecutor requested their immediate arrest, but the judge believed that it was not justified.
Iliass Khayari is therefore free until the final verdict which could take several months until decided.

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is up for re-election in 2018 but said Sunday they do not give a sh*t about being reelected.
“I don't give a sh*t, you understand? I just don't give a sh*t,” they said in an interview with Charleston Gazette Mail. “Don't care if I get elected, don't care if I get defeated, how about that. If they think because I'm up for election, that I can be wrangled into voting for sh*t that I don't like and can't explain, they're all crazy.”
Manchin's comments come as they and three other Senate Democrats refused to sign a letter establishing the party line on tax reform.
“The bottom line is, if it doesn't help West Virginia, it doesn't make sense to me, and just because there's an election doesn't mean I sign on or don't sign on,” Manchin said.
Manchin is seeking re-election in a state that President Donald Trump won by a massive margin. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice publicly switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican party at a rally for Trump in West Virginia Thursday night, where they shared their reasoning behind changing their party affiliation.

“I'm not scared of an election, let's put it that way. Elections do not bother me or scare me. I'm going to continue to do the same thing I've always done, extremely independent,” Manchin said.

With a few clicks of the mouse, anybody can see that Byrd dramatically lowered the rate at which they hit ground balls in 2013, from an average of 1.06 per flyball in their 3 declining years with the Cubs to 0.62 in their breakout stretch with the Mets. With a few more clicks they can view video of any of Byrd's at-bats over the last 3, 4, 5 years. But the point is not what the numbers say about Byrd, because the numbers still say that, even with the Pirates, they were a hitter whose production would have made an $8 million salary seem reasonable. The point is that the Phillies still seem to be operating with the philosophy that the subjective opinions of their personnel men are the most important variable in deciding a player's value.
We dropped by EPCOT a few days ahead of the official March 2nd start of the EPCOT International Flower & Garden Festival and were happy to see many of the topiary and flower beds were already installed. Because of that we're able to provide you with this extended preview of the most colorful festival of the year at EPCOT.
This year the festival runs for 90 days, which means it will require at least two complete crop rotations to keep the floral displays fresh and seasonal. More than 500,000 plants, trees, and shrubs are planted for the festival; 250,000 of those are annual blossoms installed for the festival. Disney estimates that over 30 million blooms will blanket the park.
This year there will be 13 outdoor kitchens offering dozens of new sweet and savory food and beverage menu items. I'm looking forward to the new La Isla Fresca and Cider House kitchens.
The main front-entrance topiary scene is inspired by a 1943 Donald Duck comic book “The Victory Garden.” Included in the garden are the first-ever Huey, Dewey and Louie topiary, plus Donald and Daisy.
A huge thanks to Disney's team of more than 400 horticulture experts for putting on this beautiful show for us. We have 90 glorious days to enjoy the festival this year. So make plans to head to EPCOT before May 30th and enjoy the 23rd EPCOT International Flower & Garden Festival.
That's part one of the update, we'll have more photos from around the World Showcase tomorrow.
WASHINGTON—Gay rights activists protested the defeat of bill S. 743 Monday, saying that the proposed legislation giving homosexuals the right to marry was derailed by the National Association of Semi-personalized Linens Manufacturers (NASLM), a powerful lobby representing the nation's gender-specific bath-towel makers. "The special interests of those producing matching knickknacks for traditional heterosexual couples have been over-represented in this debate for far too long," said GLAAD president Neil Giuliano, citing the influential lobby's contribution of more than $95 million in campaign funds during the last election cycle. "We cannot allow the outdated values of a profiteering minority of towel makers stand in the way of social change." NASLM released a statement in response to Giuliano's criticism that expressed the organization's belief that "marriage is a sacred bond between a theirs and a hers."

Quacking Like a Duck
One of the oft heard complaints about modern medicine is that it's dominated by "big pharma," that is greedy, soulless corporations who lie to us and suppress less expensive and more effective treatments for monetary gain. While it's true that corporations are out for monetary gain, and there have been irregularities as with any big business, let's take a look at the pot that's calling the kettle greedy here.
Consider a single product: Oscillococcinum.
Their site never actually says that the "FDA regulated drug" does anything... really, read carefully. It doesn't. They do claim it is a "Flu Medicine." And they claim studies have shown its effectiveness in reducing flu symptoms. We'll save examining the studies for another time, for the purpose of this article, let's focus on the ingredients.
Pharmaceuticals such as Tamiflu and Zithromax are tested for years before they're released to the public. Teams of chemists, lawyers, doctors, nurses, clinical researches, and study subjects go over every conceivable side effect or quality control issue before the drug is released to the market. These procedures cost an incredibly large amount of money, and while it may, in fact, be ridiculous to charge $5 for a pill, there is at least some basis for them being expensive. Part of that basis, is that they have active ingredients.
Not so for Oscilloccinum.
Each capsule is 1 gram, and it contains a 200X preparation of muscovy duck heart and liver, .15g of lactose (milk sugar), and .85g of sucrose (table sugar). For those unwilling to do math, the sugars add up to 1.00g. Er.. where's the duck liver? Well, a 200x preparation of anything is past Avogadro's limit. It's chemically impossible for there to be even one molecule of duck liver in an Oscilloccinum capsule. That means... there is exactly no duck liver in it. In fact, it's a capsule of sugar, more suited for sweetening tea than reducing your flu symptoms. The tea might help though.
What does the company have to say about this? Gina Casey, manufacturer Boiron's spokesperson says "Of course it's safe: there's nothing in it."
So how much is this product that's basically less than 1¢ worth of sugar? $21.59 will buy you 6 dosages, which are to be taken up to three times a day. At $3.60 a capsule, that's a pretty tidy profit, wouldn't you say? Oh, I failed to mention... it's available in over 50 countries.
I was in a "health" food store today, and their very prominent displays of Oscillococcinum were nearly depleted. Why? Fear of H1N1 or "Swine Flu." Not even Boiron says the stuff will do anything to prevent the flu, but people are buying it in droves.
Greed did someone say? I'd say selling something with no active ingredients is the very definition of greed. In fact, there's another word for it: snake oil. Maybe we can find some tar to go with all those duck feathers their factories must produce. Oh wait, never mind. A single duck would have provided far more than enough liver and heart for every single capsule ever made. And it would still be quacking to boot, just like the people who promote this stuff.

The federal government moved Tuesday to declare all chimpanzees endangered, an act that would provide stronger protections and potentially end nearly a century of using great apes as test subjects for invasive medical research.
In announcing the proposal, Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said that a 1990 decision by the agency to classify wild chimps as endangered and captive chimps as threatened, a designation that carries fewer protections, was flawed. The “split listing” under the Endangered Species Act, the only one in the history of the agency, was designed to allow the National Institutes of Health to fund medical experiments using captive chimps, they said in an interview.
“The rule proposed today would correct this inconsistency,” the agency said, adding that the rule will be open for public comment for 60 days and finalized in December.
Ashe said the new rule sends a clear message that, contrary to popular belief, the survival of all chimps is threatened.
More than a million have disappeared from the wild since the beginning of the 20th century, according to estimates by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. Fewer than 300,000 remain, as people invade chimpanzee habitats, using the land to farm and hunting the animals for meat, according to IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species.

“The most important thing about this is it brings attention to the plight of chimpanzees in the wild,” Ashe said. Because chimps are often dressed in clothing and used as comic relief in movies, Americans do not believe they are endangered, they said.
Ashe said it is unclear how tougher protections for captive chimpanzees would affect NIH research projects or the use of the animals in the entertainment industry or circuses. Those aspects, they said, would be worked out during development of the final rule. But it is all but certain that any future medical research involving chimps would require Fish and Wildlife's approval and a permit, officials said.
Members of the conservation organizations that requested an endangered listing for captive chimps two years ago — including the Humane Society of the United States, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Jane Goodall Institute — said the change would have a profound effect on restricting the use of chimps in medical research.
They noted that the Fish and Wildlife proposal dovetailed with recent findings by two federal research bodies, the Institute of Medicine and an NIH advisory panel, that it was not necessary to use chimps for research on human diseases.
Classifying all chimps as endangered also would affect the exotic-animal business, which peddles chimps as pets.
Buyers and sellers would be barred from taking chimps across state lines. International commerce would be banned.
“There are breeders who breed them for pets and the entertainment industry . . . dressing them up, and clothes makes people think of them as not endangered,” said Kathleen Conlee, vice president for animal research issues at the Humane Society.

In recent years, the NIH, which established the United States as a powerhouse for chimp research by investing hundreds of millions of dollars in medical testing, has scaled back its use of the animals.
At the start of this year, the NIH's Council of Councils, an advisory group, proposed to severely restrict medical and behavioral research on chimps and to send most research chimps into retirement.
The United States is the only nation in the developed world that continues to use apes for research. European nations banned the practice years ago, but along with the United States, continue to use large numbers of rhesus macaques and spider monkeys as test subjects.
Conservationists praised the proposal to protect captive apes, saying it would accelerate the NIH's slow phaseout of testing. The agency's director, Francis Collins, has not decided whether to accept the council's recommendations nearly four months after the required 60 days to mull it over.
The NIH has maintained that medical research involving chimps has benefited humans. It cites the development of vaccines for hepatitis A and B, which are now in use; the finding that elevated levels of salt in diets leads to high blood pressure; and the development of antibodies used to treat certain cancers.
James Anderson, deputy director for program planning at NIH, said the agency is also concerned about the disappearance of chimps in the wild and will work with the Fish and Wildlife Service to establish a process for permits.
Hundreds of other chimpanzees are also in private hands, available for lease to laboratories for experiments. But those facilities could suffer economically if the NIH continues to cut funding for medical research involving apes.
If the Fish and Wildlife Service's proposal is finalized, organizations wanting to use chimps in medical research would have to obtain permits and provide explanations on how the work would benefit apes — such as through testing for diseases specific to chimps or through financial donations for chimp conservation efforts.
“Things are moving down a funnel, and what's going to come out at the other end, we think, is the practical end of chimpanzee use in invasive research,” said John Pippin, director of medical affairs for the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.
Jane Goodall, founder of their namesake institute, said the Fish and Wildlife Service's call to protect great apes is “a major step in the right direction. It's something we've been fighting for a very long time.”
But in a telephone interview from Bournemouth, England, they said: “Far more rhesus monkeys are used than chimps . . . also squirrel monkeys . . . in other countries. Monkeys are one of the most common animals used for medical research.”
A 20% shortfall in migrant workers relied on to pick fruit and vegetables is blamed on Brexit making the UK seem ‘xenophobic'
Farms have been hit with a shortage of the migrant workers that Britain relies on to bring in the fruit and vegetable harvests, according to a series of new reports.
There was a 17% shortfall in May, leaving some farms critically short of pickers, according to a new National Farmers Union (NFU) survey. The decline is blamed on Brexit, with the vote to depart the EU leaving the UK seen as “xenophobic” and “racist” by overseas workers, according to the director of a major agricultural recruitment company.
The UK requires about 80,000 seasonal workers to pick the vegetable and fruit harvest and virtually all come from eastern Europe. Just 14 of the 13,400 workers recruited between January and May this year were British, the NFU survey found. Three-quarters of the workers came from Bulgaria and Romania, and almost all the rest from other eastern European countries.
British farmers warn loss of EU workers will see strawberry prices soar Read more
The authoritative NFU analysis showed the shortfall in May 2016, before the Brexit referendum, was just 4%. It also showed the proportion of overseas workers choosing to return to the UK has plummeted from two-thirds to one-third since January, meaning valuable experience is being lost.
“The grim reality is that the perception from overseas is we are xenophobic, we're racist, and the pound has plummeted too,” said John Hardman, director at Hops Labour Solutions, who also estimates a 20% shortage of workers. “We've gone with Brexit and that makes us look unfriendly.
“The immediate impact is that there will be crops left in the fields,” they said. “[The warning] couldn't be more timely with Wimbledon around the corner as 99.9% of Wimbledon strawberries are picked by eastern Europeans.”
Another large survey of salad and fruit farmers, released by the BBC on Thursday, found that 21% reported fewer workers than they needed in late May. Almost 80% of the growers said recruitment had been more difficult than last year, with 20% saying it had been the hardest for years.
Further evidence of the labour crisis comes from a recent survey by the CLA, which represents rural land and business owners. It found that 44% of its members said they had experienced a reduction in the availability of migrant labour over the past year.
“Farmers and growers need to know how the government will deal with the need from industries that rely on seasonal workers,” said Ali Capper, chair of the NFU horticulture board. “The NFU is calling for reassurance that farmers will be able to source a reliable and competent workforce both now and in the future. Without that, this trend is likely to continue and will hit hard.”
A previous seasonal agricultural workers scheme was scrapped by Theresa May when they were home secretary, after Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU. Farmers have been calling for a new scheme since the Brexit vote.
But in March, the immigration minister, Robert Goodwill, told MPs: “We do not believe there is sufficient evidence to justify a seasonal agricultural workers' scheme in 2017.” The NFU's concerns about food rotting in the fields due to a lack of workers were “a little bit of a scare story”, they said.
A government spokesperson said: “We are determined to get the best deal for the UK in our negotiations to leave the EU, not least for our world-leading food and farming industry, which is a key part of our nation's economic success.”
Hardman said people who thought the shortage of farm labour could be filled by UK workers were “delusional”. They said: “There is no appetite in the UK labour pool for seasonal agricultural work.” The hospitality industry was more attractive for temporary work and unemployment is low in key areas, like Kent, they said.
Brexit could herald end to British fruit and veg sales, producers warn Read more
Hardman said they understood why the government has not committed to a new migrant worker scheme: “Firstly, it's political suicide and secondly they are working on hard historical data. Eighteen months ago we did not have an issue, but the tide of shortages is on its way.”
Another report on Thursday, from the industry group British Summer Fruits, estimates that strawberry and raspberry prices will jump 35%-50% if British growers do not have access to seasonal overseas workers after Brexit.
In August 2016, some of the Britain's biggest fruit and vegetable growers said that without seasonal migrant workers they would switch their production to other countries, where many already have large operations, or would switch to cereals which are harvested by machines.

In mid-September, nearly six months into the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, President Obama formally announced that the U.S. military would lead the fight against the virus in West Africa.
"The reality is, this epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better," Obama said Sept. 16. "But right now, the world still has an opportunity to save countless lives."
The U.S. military is sending as many as 4,000 service members to West Africa, where they will provide medical, logistical and security support for what the Department of Defense has dubbed Operation United Assistance.
"Stopping the spread of this disease is the core mission here," Gen. David Rodriguez, chief of U.S. Africa Command, said last week.

As The Post's Checkpoint blog reported, the bulk of the military's deployments will come from the Army.
Late last month, in Liberia's capital of Monrovia, U.S. Africa Command's Maj. Gen. Darryl A. Williams told reporters that the U.S. operation "is about urgency and speed," according to Reuters.
Among the first orders of business: building a 25-bed hospital for health-care workers who become infected with the deadly virus while working on the front lines of the Ebola outbreak. The modular hospital, known in military parlance as an expeditionary medical support system (EMED for short), is being constructed near the airport outside Monrovia.

The U.S. military is also planning to build and supply 17 treatment units across the Ebola-ravaged country, according to Reuters. But, added Williams, the war on Ebola will be led by Liberia.
"The (Armed Forces of Liberia) has a great capability," Williams said. "They are already out there ... and helping us, because they have this knowledge of the local area. So we are not doing anything by ourselves."

But according to Voice of America, "local residents had mixed feelings about the military involvement as the first uniformed soldiers arrived here at the end of September."

"Well, seeing them is like sometimes happiness, sometimes not. I don't know," Acostel Tmba, a local resident, told Voice of America. "I don't know their real mission here.
"I overheard that they're here for them to fight the Ebola virus in this nation. So seeing them, sometime we're pleased for us to see the U.S. Army in this country, for them to help to fight the Ebola virus."
In the United States, troops preparing for the mission have been training to properly put on and remove personal protective equipment for a new kind of war.
"I mean, it's nice that you're not worried about getting shot," Army Spec. Cody Adams, who served in Afghanistan, told public radio station WPLN during training at Fort Campbell, Ky. "But just — the threat is everywhere now."
Ebola, Army Sgt. Anthony Maddox told CBS News, is "just like a hostile combatant on the battlefield, it can kill you. But this one isn't so much ... you can't see it — you know it's there, but you can't see it."

DOWNEY (AP) — A Downey police officer was shot to death in their own car as they were getting off work in what investigators said Thursday was a botched robbery attempt by two young men and a teenager who were arrested within hours.
Downey police Officer Ricardo “Ricky” Galvez, 29, was in plainclothes in the driver's seat of their car at the end of their shift when two men ran up and opened fire late Wednesday, Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. John Corina said.
The five-year department veteran, also a Marine, died in the car.
Corina said the attackers — two men in their 20s and a 17-year-old — were out looking for someone to rob when they spotted Galvez sitting in their car after finishing work. Galvez was shot seconds later.
“They were attempting to rob Officer Galvez not realizing they were a police officer,” Corina said. “I don't even think they saw these guys coming up on him.”
Another officer heard the gunshots and pursued the attackers as they fled into the neighboring city of Montebello. Investigators said they arrested the getaway driver and other people were detained after SWAT officers swept surrounding neighborhoods.
Police also said they had recovered a gun they suspect was used to kill Galvez.
A young woman who identified themselves as the sister of one of the suspects cried and yelled outside a news conference announcing the arrests that their brother didn't do it.
Detectives knew quickly that Galvez had been shot in a deliberate, targeted attack.
“It appeared to be an ambush style. It happened very quickly,” Corina said after viewing surveillance video of the shooting.
Corina said they aren't immediately able to tell if words were exchanged before Galvez was shot.
Downey poice Chief Carl Charles praised Galvez's professionalism and said the officer had an infectious smile and a great attitude.
“Words cannot express the love we have for Ricky,” they said.
Galvez was a Marine veteran from the Downey area. They were single and lived close to their siblings and other family members, Charles said at a news conference.
Downey police Lt. Mark McDaniel said Galvez “loved serving the city and they loved serving their country.”
“If you could mold a police officer, you would mold that police officer after Ricky Galvez,” McDaniel said. “We have a lot of police officers here who are hurting. We'll never get over it and we'll always remember Ricky.”
Dozens of officers wiped away tears and saluted as police carried Galvez's American flag-draped body from the crime scene to a coroner's van.
California Gov. Jerry Brown said flags will be flown at half-staff at the Capitol in Sacramento in honor of Galvez.

Violent storms will batter cliffs and promenades along the south coast this weekend, with tidal surges and gale-force winds set to cause more flooding for days to come. Forecasters warned that there would be no let-up in the severe weather as defence chiefs committed 5,000 military personnel to the flood relief mission.
Two people were killed late on Friday in the stormy weather and the high winds left more than 16,000 homes in north Wales without power.
A cruise ship passenger died and another was airlifted to shore after their 22,000-tonne vessel was hit by a freak wave in the English Channel. Water crashed through a window, injuring a number of the 735 passengers. An 85-year-old male passenger and a woman passenger in their 70s were airlifted off the ship. The male passenger later died.
In Holborn, central London, a woman died and a man was taken to hospital after a building collapsed on to a car. The accident happened at 11.05pm last night opposite Holborn tube station, a Metropolitan police spokesperson said. "There were two occupants in the car and a woman was pronounced dead at the scene. A man was pulled from the car and was taken to hospital, where they are in a stable situation at the moment."
A man also died in hospital on Friday night after being hit by a falling tree in their garden in Gwynedd during Wednesday's storm.
The Environment Agency said the misery would continue into next week. By late Friday it had issued 23 severe flood warnings – meaning there is a threat to life – along the Thames, the Severn at Gloucester, on the Somerset Levels, and on the south coast, along with hundreds more flood warnings and alerts across England and Wales.
Forecasters said that high sea levels and waves up to 10 metres (33ft) high created a high risk of flooding to parts of the Dorset coast this weekend, particularly Christchurch, Chiswell and Preston.
Major General Patrick Sanders, assistant chief of defence staff, told a Whitehall briefing that 2,200 sailors, soldiers and RAF crews were involved in the relief effort and a further 3,000 military personnel were on standby. "This is not our day job. Our day job looks more like Afghanistan, but our role is to defend the country from any threats, and that includes weather as well," they said.
The RAF earlier deployed a Tornado reconnaissance jet to capture images of the flood-ravaged Thames valley, where more than 1,000 homes were evacuated and 11 military helicopters were ready to be called into action. The Thames has risen to its highest levels in 60 years, forecasters say, with communities in Windsor, Maidenhead, parts of Surrey, Buckinghamshire, west Berkshire and Reading at risk of significant flooding in the coming days.
The exceptional weather has prompted the Environment Agency to pause its controversial redundancy programme – the subject of heated exchanges between David Cameron and Ed Miliband during prime minister's questions – because it was "quite rightly prioritising incident response".
The prime minister said on Friday that the government was "fighting on every front to help people". They said: "We are making sure that today, before the next rise in the level of the Thames over the weekend, we do everything we can to protect more homes and protect more communities.
"Of course I am very sorry for any way that people have suffered. What we have tried to do is stand up the emergency response arrangements as quickly as we could," they added.
People in the United Kingdom are becoming happier despite division over Brexit and economic uncertainty, a report has revealed.
A survey of 1,000 people in more than 150 countries asked them to rate their happiness on a scale of 0-10 based on income and life expectancy, along with their feelings about social support, personal freedom, corruption and generosity.
The UK had a score of 6.5 happiness ratio in 2015, but this increased to 6.8 in 2016 when the survey was carried out in December, several months after the Brexit vote.
Britain ranked 19th, up four places out of 155 countries in the World Happiness Report 2017 - ahead of France which came in at 31, although Germany is happier than we are at 16.
However the UK is less happy than it was in 2008, when it topped 6.9.
And the Irish have bigger smiles - they topped us by four places coming in at 15th.
Image: Norway was ranked as the happiest country
The report, compiled by Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a global initiative launched by the United Nations in 2012, covers a three-year period up until the end of 2016.
It showed people in Norway were the happiest, whilst people in the Central African Republic were the least happy.
Researchers found that money does not buy happiness: the US has seen an increase in income and falling unemployment, but dropped a place in the rankings to 14th.
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the SDSN and a special adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General, said: "Happy countries are the ones that have a healthy balance of prosperity, as conventionally measured, and social capital, meaning a high degree of trust in a society, low inequality and confidence in government."
They called on countries with a low happiness rating to appoint ministers of happiness.
They said: I want governments to measure this, discuss it, analyse it and understand when they have been off on the wrong direction."

Freddie Lee Mason, Jr., 32, and Jerome Lateek Thomspon, 29, both of Myrtle Beach, have been arrested after a shooting incident at an apartment complex on July 10 in Myrtle Beach. (Myrtle Beach Police, J. Reuben Long Detention Center / WPDE Background)
Freddie Lee Mason, Jr., 32, and Jerome Lateek Thomspon, 29, both of Myrtle Beach, have been arrested after a shooting incident at an apartment complex on July 10 in Myrtle Beach.
Mason is charged with possession of a weapon during a violent crime, three charges of attempted murder, four charges of kidnapping, first degree burglary and first degree assault and battery, according to warrants.
Thompson is charged with kidnapping, burglary and attempted murder, according to warrants.
According to warrants for Mason, on July 10, police responded to the 4500 block of North Kings Highway for a shooting incident. Police say they learned Mason forced entry into an apartment and physically assaulted a woman by pointing a gun at them and threatening to kill them The warrant says Mason was calling for another person in the home and fired multiple shots.
The shots were fired near two children, ages 10 and 9, according to the warrants.
One of the victims was able to get to a weapon and returned fire, at which point Mason left the apartment, according to the warrant.
Warrants for Thompson state that they drove Mason to the apartment complex and waited for them to leave. They then reportedly drove Mason away from the scene. Since they and Mason worked in concert, they are charged in connection with the case, according to the warrants.
Mason is also facing drug charges from a search on July 11 where police found marijuana and cocaine, according to warrants.
A new local Twitter feed appeared on April 25, 2009. In the “bio,” the anonymous author describes it this way: “I spent 5 months in the Washtenaw County Jail in 2008. I had never been in trouble with the law before. Here's what I experienced – 140 characters at a time.”
In their second Tweet: “I will not yet reveal my identity nor my alleged crime. I will say that I was 42 years old when I served my time and had never been in jail.”
The author agreed to answer some questions for us.
But first, a sample from the Twitter feed. Note that the entries read in chronological order, most recent first.
-------------------- A nurse comes with medication. I tell them how many hours I have been in jail without my phone call. They do not look very interested. Wed, May 6, 2009 9:51 AM -------------------- It is the loudest flush I have ever heard, filling the cell with sound, halting all conversation for about 30 seconds. Wed, May 6, 2009 9:21 AM -------------------- "Flush on 2!" Fred yells. "Can you give us a flush on 2?" We do not operate our own toilets. Wed, May 6, 2009 9:14 AM -------------------- Fred pounds a few times until they have a guard's attention. Then makes a twisty motion with their fingers. Wed, May 6, 2009 8:57 AM -------------------- By now the stench is approaching unbearable. Fred gets up and pounds on the cell window. Wed, May 6, 2009 8:33 AM --------------------

Q & A
We confirmed that the author was jailed at Washtenaw County jail at 2201 Hogback Road during 2008. The Chronicle acknowledges that this is one side of a multi-faceted tale, some of which predates the author's incarceration. However, the narrative provides a literate insight into a tax-funded facility that most readers of The Chronicle will not experience first hand in the same way as the author. And we were curious to know a bit more about this writing project than was reflected in the Twitter bio.
1. Describe the writing process. Do you ever have to shave down sentences to fit 140 characters? Did you write out the whole thing in advance? Given the level of detail, you must have taken notes, right? Do you try to leave the last Tweet for the day as a “cliffhanger”?
There are a few parts that I took notes on during my stay in jail and I've referred to them as reminders, but the writing, itself, is all as I remember it – 140 characters at a time. Not as difficult as I thought it would be and it's forcing me to tighten up my usually wordy writing, anyway.
As for “cliffhangers,” when it's your first time in jail, every moment is a cliffhanger. I had no idea what to expect. Also, in the first couple of months, before I knew what my final sentence would be, every day seemed to be a cliffhanger to me.
2. Do you keep in touch with anybody you met in jail?
Yes, I have corresponded with, and called, a few people I met in jail. There are so many stories in each individual person I met, and some of them wanted me to help them write their personal stories. I am following up with them as time permits. I am also still in touch with one corrections officer – one good one who really does care about the people they are placed in charge of. I will get to them in my story much later.
3. Do you have a favorite euphemism for the time gap on the resume – like “independent projects?”
This was a very sad time in my life. It froze my career and, more importantly, separated me from my young children. They think I was away on a long “work trip,” and the psychological impact of me being away is still being noticed. I don't have a favorite euphemism. They are all bad.
4. At home, with family, or at work, you find yourself citing your jail time as evidence that you've seen and experienced more than the average bear can even imagine? Or is it something that's just taboo?
No. It is an experience I do not wish on anybody and I hope most find out only second-hand through people like me. It is not a taboo subject at home, but it brings up a great deal of pain that my wife and I still need to sort through.
5. Any idea how much it cost to house you at the jail for five months?
I have no idea, but probably not as much as it might look on the books. I will bring this up later in my narrative – how the system not only takes away your rights and freedoms, but robs you blind by giving you food portions that are not enough to feed a grown man and then making you pay for anything “extra.”
I recently arrived home from one of the largest Zouk congresses in the world. It was full of all kinds of social dance partners, but there are a few that truly stick out in my mind. One was a dance where, after the first 20 seconds, I became very scared for my safety. But, unlike every other rough dance I've had, the leader managed to transform this dance into one of my most memorable of the weekend.
It was clear from 0:01 that the guy could dance. They had good body control, good footwork, and was very musical. However, there was a caveat: they over-led every single movement. This meant that most of the steps were led with such force that I had to hold myself ‘on guard' at all times. Needless to say, this does not make a dance enjoyable.
About 20 seconds into the dance, they attempted a turn that would place my arm into a hammer lock position (This means that my arm would be bent behind my back at a 90-degree angle). Just FYI: I don't do hammer locks with rough leads; it's a recipe for an injury. So, I didn't follow the lead. I just did a little sway on the spot.
Now, the lead assumed that the reason I hadn't followed was because I didn't know what they were doing. They led it again – ironically with more force, and with the added pressure of the thumb digging in to the top of the hand.. I again didn't go there, and instead just responded with a body movement. Rather than let it go and carry on, they made eye contact, began the lead again, and started trying to use their other hand to force-turn me. Recipe for a nightmare, no?
I refused to move. Instead, I shook my head, leaned in close and said, “I know what you're trying to lead. I'm not going there because the way you are leading is too forceful and it's hurting me.”
Eyes wide, they stopped looked at me for a good 2 seconds. Based on the fact that he'd tried to force-lead the movement, my guess would have been that they would leave the dance angry and insulted. They decided to prove me wrong. Very deliberately, they conducted the same lead again – but with a gentle movement. I followed.
We danced 3 more songs in a row. They were effing fantastic. The person from the first :20 seconds of the song was gone, replaced by a considerate, gentle and expressive lead that I loved dancing with. It turned into one of my best dances of the night. There are a couple takeaways for this, both for leads and follows.
Follows, the leads who care about you and want to give you a good dance will listen to you. This doesn't give you a carte blanche to say mean things about their dancing; no one is perfect. It does mean that you can use your voice (and your body) to communicate when things aren't going so well for you. You aren't relegated to be a passive, submissive part of the dance; you can ask (or comment) in a civil way to obtain the dance you are looking for.
Leads, this guy erred only in one thing: trying to force the initial movement. Everything else this lead handled absolutely wonderfully. Rather than take offense, they adapted their dance and ended up making us both happy. They could have been offended or discouraged, but instead they changed their approach to resolve an issue. Would it have been better if they had picked up on the initial dance body language I was giving? Yes, but no one is perfect. You all have this power: to adapt your approach to make follows happy. It only requires an open mind and paying attention to what the follows are saying – verbally and non-verbally.

Syrian rebels beheaded an 11-year-old boy in the latest sickening killing to be captured on camera, it has been reported.
The men, part of a militia which has received support from Arab and western nations including the UK, appear to taunt the bound and terrified child, who they claim is a captured pro-government Palestinian fighter.
They then appear to grab their hair and cut their throat with a knife.
The BBC reports incident took place in Handarat, north of Aleppo, where there has been heavy fighting.
The area is the location of the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein El Tal.
A total of 7,000 people lived there before armed groups forced them to flee in 2013.
The boy was identified on social media identified as 'Abdullah Issa'.
The men in the first video say they are a member of the Liwa al-Quds (the Jerusalem Brigade), a Palestinian pro-government militia.
Enab Baladi, a pro-opposition news website, said the boy was captured in Handarat by the Nour al-Din al-Zinki Movement, which governs parts of Aleppo city and al-Qassemiya village in the western part of Aleppo governorate.
The leader Toufic Shehab al-Dine asserted the group's independence from the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the main force fighting Assad, and its military wing, the Free Syrian Army.

Amnesty International published a report saying Nour al-Din al-Zinki Movement fighters have abducted and tortured civilians.
The group is reported to have had financial and military support from the US, UK, France, Turkey, Qatar and other Gulf Arab states in the past.
One random companionless cloud drifts indifferently over my plastered box, igniting a debate within my head. Over the Sheep Range, another cloud, this one thick with moisture and building towards the upper levels of the atmosphere prompts further discussion. Should I consider it a sign? Will the day mutate into something worthy of a blistering battle with the sun? I can't help but be an optimist, so I grab my gear and melt into my 170° F car seat. The whine of a Dog Day Cicada, playing favorites with the tree in my yard, is muted once I slam the door and start the engine. I've left my sunglasses on the dash again and am left squinting angrily at the sun filled roadway, holding them in the cool air that blows from the vents. An iPod and an iced coffee rest to my right in the center console cup holders. The temperature reads 108° F and it is hot!
Relying on the weatherman in Las Vegas is akin to receiving advice from a baker on a pop quiz for a chemistry class. Come to think of it, perhaps a baker would be better suited as a weatherman here, seeing as we live in an oven. I will say, the one thing the Las Vegas weather folk tend to predict correctly is the wind. Bad predictions aside, I do rely heavily on the off chance of a thunderstorm to motivate me. There are few more awesome events during summer in the Mojave than a drenching of rain to chill the troposphere. I have seen the temperature drop from 110° F to the mid 60's in a matter of minutes. The redolence the moisture provides creates an explosion of awe within the olfactory senses. And for just a few precious moments, it seems as if you can hear the collective sigh of all things lively within this roasting rock filled range.
Over the last few months I have done what I can to enjoy the Mojave. I have taken a few trips further abroad, such as in the mountains of Montana. But seeing as this blog tends towards a desert theme, I thought better to leave those out. So below are some images I have selected that reflect the more interesting moments I encountered over this years Mojave summer and thought I would just wrap it up before the active fall and winter months to come. I hope you enjoy them…
100 degrees and sunny, 100 degrees and sunny, 100 degrees and sunny. This is the usual forecast a desert dweller faces when they check their weather app and it is the one I confirmed this morning. Sometimes it seems as if this trend will never end and follows deep into the months of September and October. My eye twitches as I hastily toss my phone on the dresser. The hum of the air conditioner is a constant soundtrack to the slow hot moments of what should not be summer and that damn Dog Day Cicada is whining and clicking away. But alas, I can see the head of a cumulonimbus cloud peaking above the rooftop of the neighbors house. Maybe today won't be such a bad day after all. No thanks to the weatherman anyways.
End Summer Begin Fall…please
John Carmack, renowned programmer and Oculus executive, spoke out this week about claims that they developed the Oculus Rift using code he'd written at their previous job.
The claims were made during the ZeniMax Media vs. Oculus lawsuit, which ended on Wednesday (Feb. 1). The jury awarded ZeniMax $500 million after finding, among other things, that Oculus developed its flagship virtual reality product using ”non-literal” copies of code Carmack had written while they still worked at ZeniMax.
“This is just not true,” Carmack wrote on Facebook on Thursday.
In legal terms, a non-literal copy is one that is “substantially similar” to the original. In their post, Carmack disputed the testimony of an expert for the plaintiff, who had told the jury a non-literal copy would be like a duplicate Harry Potter book with only the names changed. It's not an exact copy, but it still constitutes copyright infringement.
“I agree; that is the literary equivalent of changing the variable names when you copy source code,” Carmack wrote. “However, if you abstract Harry Potter up a notch or two, you get Campbell's Hero's Journey, which also maps well onto Star Wars and hundreds of other stories. These are not copyright infringement.”
Carmack, a celebrated game developer who revolutionized the field of computer graphics in the 1990s, left ZeniMax for Oculus in 2013 after becoming enamored with virtual reality. Before their departure, according to the suit, they had been collaborating with Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey on the development of the Oculus Rift. ZeniMax filed its lawsuit the following year, shortly after Oculus had been acquired by Facebook for $2.3 billion. The suit claimed that Carmack had essentially smuggled out intellectual property he'd developed using ZeniMax's time and resources, and used it to build the Rift.
“I was wondering if gangsters had kidnapped their grandchildren and were holding them for ransom.”
The jury cleared Carmack of many of ZeniMax's accusations, including one that he'd deleted data to cover their tracks in the alleged heist. Carmack was also not found personally liable for any of the $500 million—that was spread out among Oculus itself, Luckey, and former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe.
Still, the copyright infringement allegation stuck, and as they watched the expert testimony that led to that finding, Carmack took serious issue with the assessment.
“After they had said they were ‘Absolutely certain there was non-literal copying' in several cases, I just wanted to shout ‘You lie!'” Carmack wrote in their post. “By the end, after seven cases of ‘absolutely certain,' I was wondering if gangsters had kidnapped their grandchildren and were holding them for ransom.”
Copyright law, particularly when applied to software, is tricky. When Carmack writes about “abstracting up” Harry Potter to the “hero's journey,” a generic story template defined by Joseph Campbell in 1949, he's making a well-worn argument about copyrighting code. He's suggesting that the code in question isn't so much the thing itself, but an abstraction of the thing:
A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on their fellow man. – The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell (1949)
The point is that if Carmack and their team wrote the Oculus Rift code from scratch, as they say they did, there are only so many ways to implement the abstract functionality that makes virtual reality work. This is similar to arguments made in the Oracle vs. Google lawsuit that ended last year. Oracle had accused Google of stealing its software interface to the Java programming language for use in its Android devices. Google argued that such code was too low-level to be subject to copyright. Google ultimately won the case, but not before a federal court ruled that interface code is indeed something than can be copyrighted.
On Friday (Feb. 3), ZeniMax released a statement in response to Carmack's post:
In addition to expert testimony finding both literal and non-literal copying, Oculus programmers themselves admitted using Zenimax's copyrighted code (one saying they cut and pasted it into the Oculus SDK), and [Oculus VR co-founder] Brendan Iribe, in writing, requested a license for the ‘source code shared by Carmack' they needed for the Oculus Rift. Not surprisingly, the jury found Zenimax code copyrights were infringed. The Oculus Rift was built on a foundation of Zenimax technology.
ZeniMax has also said it may now seek to stop the sale Oculus Rift headsets. And according to reporting by Polygon, Oculus says it will appeal the verdict.
Description
With 347 illuminated pages each measuring approximately 535 x 380mm, the Sherborne Missal is probably the largest and most lavishly decorated English service book to survive from the Middle Ages.
A missal is a book that contains all the texts required for celebrating Mass, the central service of the liturgy. Every medieval church and monastic house needed a missal to perform the Mass each day. Yet the Sherborne Missal is exceptional for its deluxe scale and illumination.
The Sherborne Missal begins with a calendar recording the feast days celebrated throughout the year, followed by the texts that were read and chanted at different masses. As is usual for liturgical books, these are arranged in three sections. The first section is the Temporale, which provides texts for the feasts and holidays that are celebrated on different dates from year to year, such as Easter. Then the prefaces, musical notation and text are provided for the invariable part of the Mass, known as the Ordinary and Canon. The final section is the Sanctorale, which features the readings and prayers for fixed saints' days throughout the year. Some of the texts in the Sherborne Missal indicate liturgical practices that were local to south-west England.
The Missal was made for the Benedictine abbey of St Mary's in Sherborne, Dorset. The abbey's coat of arms features prominently in the illumination.
The book was probably commissioned by Robert Bruyning, the abbot of Sherborne from 1385–1415, whose image appears in the manuscript about a hundred times.  They are depicted together with Richard Mitford, who was the bishop of Salisbury from 1396–1407, and who is represented eight times.
The master craftsmen behind the manuscript also feature in the decoration – John Siferwas, the artist, and John Whas, the scribe.
Illuminated in gold and a wide range of colours, the manuscript contains a wealth of images. As well as including numerous references to Sherborne and its abbot, initials and margins throughout the manuscript are illustrated with biblical subjects designed to draw parallels between the liturgical year and the life of Christ. On the pages that relate to the most important festivals, the pictures and ornament expand to almost entirely fill the page.
The climax of the illumination is the magnificent full-page picture of the Crucifixion which precedes the text for the Canon, the part of the Mass in which the Eucharist takes place. Here the solemn figure of the crucified Christ – their face delicately modelled with an expression of resigned sadness – is surrounded by a dense crowd of onlookers. In the foreground, the eye is drawn to the swooning Virgin Mary, patroness of Sherborne Abbey.
One of the most unusual features of the manuscript's decoration is the inclusion of 44 highly naturalistic depictions of birds in the margins. Most of the birds are identified by their Middle English names such as the easily recognisable ‘ganett', ‘moorhen', ‘stork', and ‘comerant', as well as some that are harder to identify, for example the ‘wodewale' (woodpecker) and the ‘roddoke' (robin).

San Francisco—School children are being spied on by tech companies through devices and software used in classrooms that often collect and store kids' names, birth dates, browsing histories, location data, and much more—often without adequate privacy protections or the awareness and consent of parents, according to a new report from Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).
EFF's “Spying on Students: School-Issued Devices and Student Privacy” shows that state and federal law, as well as industry self-regulation, has failed to keep up with a growing educational technology industry. At the same time, schools are eager to incorporate technology in the classroom to engage students and assist teachers, but may unwittingly help tech companies surveil and track students. Ultimately, students and their data are caught in the middle without sufficient privacy protections.
One-third of all K-12 students in the U.S. use school-issued devices running software and apps that collect far more information on kids than is necessary, the report says. Resource-strapped school district can receive these tools at steeply-reduced prices or for free as tech companies seek a slice of the $8 billion dollar education technology, or ed tech, industry. But there's a real, devastating cost—the tracking, cataloguing, and exploitation of data about children as young as five years old.
Ed tech providers know privacy is important to parents, students, and schools. Of the 152 ed tech services reported to us, 118 had published privacy policies. But far fewer addressed such important privacy issues as data retention, encryption, de-identification, and aggregation. And privacy pledges don't stop companies from mining students' browsing data and other information and using it for their own purposes.
“Our report shows that the surveillance culture begins in grade school, which threatens to normalize the next generation to a digital world in which users hand over data without question in return for free services—a world that is less private not just by default, but by design,” said EFF Researcher Gennie Gebhart, an author of the report.
EFF surveyed over 1,000 stakeholders across the country, including students, parents, teachers, and school administrators, and reviewed 152 ed tech privacy policies in a year-long effort to determine whether and how ed tech companies are protecting students' privacy and their data.
“Parents, teachers, and other stakeholders feel helpless in dealing with student privacy issues in their community. In some cases students are required to use the tools and can't opt out, but they and their families are given little to no information about if or how their kids' data is being protected and collected,” said EFF Analyst Amul Kalia, a co-author of the report. “With this whitepaper, we lay out specific strategies that they can employ to gather allies, and push their schools and districts in the right direction."
“Spying on Students” provides comprehensive recommendations for parents, teachers, school administrators, and tech companies to improve the protection of student privacy. Asking the right questions, negotiating for contracts that limit or ban data collection, offering families the right to opt out, and making digital literacy and digital privacy part of school curriculum are just a few of the more than 70 recommendations for protecting student privacy contained in the report.
“The data we collected on the experiences, perceptions, and concerns of stakeholders across the country sends a loud and clear message to ed tech companies and lawmakers: families are concerned about student privacy and want an end to spy on students,” said Gebhart.

We're in the midst of another golden age of survival horror, folks. The proof doesn't just lie with the sheer number of horror games that are on the way, but also in the overall quality of the games being released. I've spent more time playing indie games in 2014 than I ever have before, because indie devs finally have easy access to the tools and platforms, like Kickstarter and Steam Greenlight, that make it easier than ever to make games and find an audience for them.
As great as this year has been for fans of the horror genre, I have the feeling it will pale in comparison to what's in store for us in 2015. We've already covered the AAA releases that are on the way, and today we're going to dive into the indies.
After a brief hiatus, Ashen Rift has returned to Kickstarter in the hopes of raising enough money to finish what looks like an incredibly promising horror game. Set in a post-apocalyptic world that's been overrun by monsters, the game follows a man and their dog as they struggle to survive.
I can't wait until Asylum finally arrives and I'm able to take it off all of these “upcoming games” lists. It's been in development for a long time, but recent looks at the current state of the game lead me to believe it isn't that far off. It's an ambitious title and one of the few adventure games we have to look forward to right now. I have the feeling the wait will be well worth it.
As intrigued as I am by the game's plot, which follows a child who finds themselves trapped on a synthetic caffeine mining vessel with some sort of dark presence, I'm not convinced Caffeine will see the light of day. Its developer has tried and failed to crowdfund it three separate times now, leaving its fate in the air for now. It's too bad, because this game is gorgeous.
Asymmetrical multiplayer has become an increasingly prevalent feature, especially in horror games. Evolve, Damned, Last Year and The Flock may be signs that this kind of multiplayer has a future in horror, where classic competitive modes have failed (Dead Space 2, Condemned 2: Bloodshot). The Flock revolves around a war between Carriers of light and the Flock, which hunt them. The world already has me hooked, it's up to the developer to make sure the game is balanced and, even more importantly, fun.
Fran Bow is another horror point-and-click adventure game, like Asylum, though that's where the similarities end. It has a quirky charm about it that I find really enticing, especially when the game reveals its darker side through the pills young Fran takes. Doing so gives them a temporary look at a gruesome version of the world around them Switching between the two worlds is fun, but it'll also be necessary if you're going to solve its puzzles.
Grave (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
I've spent quite a bit of time with Grave, a surreal horror game that, unless I'm mistaken, could be the first of its kind. This is a very strange horror game that's still very much an enigma to me even after playing both of its demos. Light and dark play an important role in the gameplay, as light is your only weapon against the creatures who inhabit its eerie world.
The Hum (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
Aliens freak a lot of people out, yet for some reason, horror game developers haven't exploited that universal fear that all humans have of being abducted in the middle of the night for a quick probing session. The Hum is the first game to try and make aliens scary, and judging by the footage we've seen of it so far, they're on the right track.
Based on the mysterious disappearances of nine hikers at the base of the base of Siberia's “Death Mountain” in 1959, Kholat wants to turn a story that's baffled scientists and unnerved the rest of us into a horror game. It's a tragic story, but it also happens to be perfect for a video game inspired by it. The circumstanced in which those hikers were found were admittedly horrific, and since their recovery more than half a century ago folks far smarter than I have tried really hard to come up with answers. Perhaps Kholat will provide them.
The latest addition to the burgeoning sect of asymmetrical multiplayer games is something called Last Year. It pits a group of teens against a masked murderer. The teens must work together to survive, but that won't be easy when the killer can come from anywhere. I've already decided I'm going to be Nick, the nerd, when I play this game. Then I'll get ridiculously good at the game, impressing all nerd kind enough that they crown me the Nerd King. But before I can realize that dream, the game needs to raise some money first.
Lethe is a physics puzzle-heavy first person horror game that follows Robert Dawn, a journalist on a mission to find the truth. Their search takes them to an isolated island, and before they can use their journalist powers to uncover its dark secrets, they get infected by a substance that gifts their hand with psychokinetic powers. It's an attractive game, and one I'd very much like to get my hands on.
Like Grave, I've already spent a fair amount of time with Monstrum and I'm happy to say I'm nothing but impressed. Massive ships with labyrinthine interiors ruin what little sense of direction I possess, and because the locations of precious items are different every time you play, there's a decent replay factor here as well as a healthy amount of scares.
From a ship lost at sea, we plunge to the murky depths of the ocean below. I still don't have a clue as to what it is that poses a threat to the diver in Narcosis, you know, other than the definite possibility that Jaws will eat you. That's assuming asphyxiation doesn't claim you first when your limited supply of oxygen runs out. I'm sure there's a more spine-tingling horror waiting for us in this game, but for now, I'll worry about Jaws.
Outlast 2 (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
So the talented folks at Red Barrels are working on a sequel to Outlast. I'm not sure what else I can say about it, other than maybe we should all consider saving up for a Depends on run once we know when to expect it.
Paranormal: The Town has been awfully quiet lately, but I imagine that's because the developer behind it is busy working on remaking the original. If you haven't played Paranormal yet, it's basically Paranormal Activity: The Game, only it takes way less time for things to get interesting. The Town will take the randomized haunts that made the first to memorable out of the confined quarters of an artist's apartment and bring them to a small town.
In Quadrant, we get to step into the boots of a member of a bio-hazardous waste removal crew that's been sent into a NASA lab that's been quarantined when a mysterious substance — possibly alien! — leaks out. Because it's a horror game, your coworkers get murdered, likely in excruciating ways, by what looks like a giant spider. I say kill it with fire and demand your hazard pay.
I love me some State of Decay, but it never gave me all of the tools I wanted in a game like that. I want to build bases, fortify them, gather resources to survive, and kick heaps of rotten zombie ass in the process. ROAM is a surprisingly ambitious survival game that offers exactly that, with an emphasis on building kickass anti-zombie fortresses. I'm all in.
I am never big into roguelike games, mostly because I'm terrible at them, but I'll be making an exception for Routine. Ever since we were given our first glimpse of it two years ago, I've been practically foaming at the mouth to get my hands on it. It looks terrifying, and it's also the type of game that doesn't waste time holding your hand. It won't be easy surviving against whatever horrors are lurking on that abandoned lunar base, but if Dark Souls has taught me anything, it's that a difficult game only makes the experience more rewarding.
Like so many before it, Scorn is a horror game that's currently looking to find success on Kickstarter. It's a horror adventure game that takes place in a “nightmarish universe” with a narrative that's been made to give players the freedom to “give their own interpretation of the events, themes and their role in this universe through exploration and interaction with the game world.”
If Dead Space experimented with a 2D style, it'd look something like Stasis. This game doesn't just want to deliver an exciting story, it also has the lofty goal of blending AAA graphics with classic, point and click gameplay. It's also worth noting that Stasis is being scored by Fallout series composer Mark Morgan, so you can be sure it'll sound great.
Summer Camp (PC, PS4, Xbox One)
It took awhile to happen, but the slasher genre that so many of us have enjoyed in movies is finally gaining traction in video games. This year has seen the reveals of four slasher games — Last Year, Until Dawn, Summer Camp and Splatter Camp — and there's a good chance we'll see most, or possibly even all, of these games release in 2015. We don't know much about this game yet, but the title alone should offer enough of a hint as to what Summer Camp will be about. Horny teens, a masked killer, fun in the sun cut tragically short by murder and mayhem, etc.
From the maker of Babysitter Bloodbath (formerly Halloween) comes another Friday the 13th inspired horror game about teens meeting an early end at the hands of a bad, bad man. If it's anything like the developer's past work, expect an awesome old school VHS aesthetic.
Subways are inherently creepy places, and I'm not just saying that because of the rat people who call those tunnels their home. U55 – End of the Line wants to remind us of this fact by cranking up the scare factor to 11 as it follows some poor soul who somehow managed to find themselves lost, alone and hunted in the underground.
Less than a week after the gut punch that was the Georgia State loss, Georgia Southern fans received another shock this afternoon when it was learned head coach Willie Fritz will be leaving Statesboro in favor of Tulane.

Kushner's tweet was later confirmed by several sources. The move can only be described as perplexing for Southern fans. Tulane fired Curtis Johnson after finishing the last two seasons at 3-9 and has been a historic doormat for most of its existence at the Super Dome and now at Yulman Stadium.
Outside of a blip on the radar — an undefeated 1998 season under Tommy Bowden — coaches have found it very, very difficult to win with the Green Wave. Fritz is surely looking at a very nice pay raise, but will that matter if the job ends up being a dead end?
Fritz also was reportedly interested in the Iowa State job, which leaves one to wonder if they were simply looking to get out of Statesboro for some reason. It doesn't matter now, he's gone.
Let's not forget Fritz went 17-7 at Georgia Southern and won a conference title for the Eagles in their first year in the FBS. Sudden moves are the nature of college football coaches and Fritz did a fantastic job for the school during their two years on the banks of Eagle Creek.
Looking forward, here's a way, way too early look at who might replace them on the sidelines:
1. Rhett Lashlee: Auburn's 32-year-old offensive coordinator would likely work well with the talent at GS. Their boss, Gus Malzahn, said just yesterday they "has everything it takes" to be a head coach. I often tell unaffiliated folks that Georgia Southern's offense under Fritz looks a lot like Auburn's.
2. Doug Ruse: Georgia Southern's offensive coordinator came with Fritz from San Houston State. The Georgia State game debacle aside, the Eagle offense has had a great couple of seasons. This would be among the easiest of transitions with Southern keeping the same game plan and likely a few assistants as well. The question is if Ruse wants to be a head coach.
3. Brent Pry: Penn State's co-defensive coordinator and assistant head coach was defensive coordinator at Georgia Southern during the Jeff Monken years. They were an unquestioned success and has quickly climbed the coaching ladder. They could find an offensive coordinator to run a GS-friendly scheme and get their head coaching career started right.
4. Dell McGee: Georgia Southern's running backs coach was promoted to assistant head coach just last month and could be named interim head coach for the bowl game. McGee won a Georgia high school state title in 2007 and has only grown their resume from there.
5. A small-school coach you've never heard of: Most of Eagle Nation didn't know who Willie Fritz was when they became head coach two years ago, and there's a good chance the same will happen when the next coach is announced. I'm a big fan of established head coaches rather than unknown assistants. They're used to being in charge, and winning is winning even if it is in FCS or Division II.

“New Year, New Me,” that's what everyone says once a new year starts but you can't expect to bring a huge change in your life if your living space doesn't change with you. If your apartment undergoes a change for the New Year, then you will feel extra motivated to bring changes in the other areas of your life and following your New Year resolutions will be easier. Revamping your apartment for the New Year is going to require a lot less effort than the rest of your resolutions, but if you don't follow the right tips, you may mess up your place.
There are a few secret revamping techniques that will change the look of your apartment entirely and the next time you invite friends over; they won't be able to stop complimenting your interior and décor. So if you want to redecorate your house this year, here are the best ways to do it:
Change the Lights:
If you have dim lights in your apartment, then the easiest way to revamp the place is by adding new lights. Get rid of the dull lamps and bulbs and put bright lights in their place. Choose the lights that go with the vibe you are trying to create for your apartment. Warm yellow lights give your place a warm and cozy feeling while bright white lights make the place feel open and airy.
You can get creative with lights and DIY lamps to hang from ceilings or near windows. Fairy lights are also a good option if you want the place to look festive. They can set the mood for both Christmas and New Year's Eve. Once the holidays are over, you can use the fairy lights to decorate a blank wall. Hang the lights across your wall and hang some photos on the wall with the help of clothespins. It is not only ideal for a Tumblr-ish feel but also covers your blank wall nicely.
Move around Furniture:
Moving the furniture around the house will make it look like you bought a new home. Maybe when you bought your apartment, you didn't know the right way to place furniture and ended up placing your bed in the room that should have been your study. If you can't decide which room should be your bed, a simple trick can help you. The room that has a place for the bed far from the door should be your bedroom. If your bed is facing the door but is as far away from the door as possible, then you will get better and relaxing sleep.
Moving furniture, whether to a new place or around the house, is a stressful task. But there are a few tips that can help you pack furniture and essentials of one room and move them to another room easily. When you change rooms, you can also change the setting of your furniture to give a new look to each room. If you keep the same settings for years, you will get tired of your house, and it will stop being a relaxing place. Changing the arrangement of furniture will give your place a fresh look.
Add Colors:
Maybe when you moved into your apartment, you didn't have the time or resources to decorate it properly. Or maybe you didn't know enough about decorating to know what to add to the walls and room. But this New Year you can make better changes in your apartment. Adding colorful items to your apartment will liven up the place. The colorful items you pick will depend solely on your personal choice. If you love art, then you can go for bright art pieces. A wall poster of Vincent Van Gogh's Sunflowers or Pablo Picasso's Three Musicians can do the trick.
If you are into movies and music, then a movie and band posters can be a good choice. And if you can't think of anything, then there are plenty of things you can find on the internet. A few colorful frames on the wall can give the whole room a vibrant feel. Bold colored accent pillows and rugs are also a good option when you are trying to add colors to your apartment.
Rearrange Bookshelves:
Shelves and bookcases house most of your decorative pieces. But after a while, they start to look boring. The best thing about bookcases and shelves is that they are pretty easy to rearrange. If your books are stacked in alphabetical order, try arranging them by color this time or vice versa. Change places of decoration pieces. You can also get a few new ones from the January sales. Antique storage boxes and decoration pieces go pretty well with books.
Another way to make your bookcases look better is by painting their insides. Make sure the paint color you choose is a different one than that of the rest of the room. This will create a nice contrast. You can paint the bookshelves yourself or with your partner. You can use the same technique throughout the house and paint shelves in different colors to give a unique look to the whole place.
New Year, New Ceiling:
If you don't want to say goodbye to white walls this year either then you can revamp your apartment by painting the ceiling. Choose a darker shade for the ceiling then the rest of your room, for instance, if your room has white walls then black or dark brown paint for the ceiling will look amazing.
Although statement ceilings became a thing last year, they haven't gone out of trend yet and are still quite new for the majority of people. All of your friends will be impressed with your unique ceiling.
Keep The Place Green:
There is no reason why plants should only be inside your house during the holidays. Greenery adds a fresh look to your apartment and is also good for the environment. Glass vases come in different designs and can be filled with flowers and water plants. Glass vases look perfect on window sills and shelves.
If you lead a very busy life and cannot take care of plants, then artificial plants are the perfect option for you. They come in pots of all sizes, and you can easily find the ones that fulfill your size requirement.
Free Up Space:
You will never have enough space in your apartment, so this New Year, with the help of a few organizing secrets, you can free up space around your place. All you have to do is make a fixed spot for everyday things like shoes, bags, coats, and keys. It is better to have these spots near the door. You can attach pegs on the wall for bags and coats and place a shoe organizer under them. A bowl for keys should be placed on top of the shoe organizer, so no one ever loses a key in your apartment.
If you want to redecorate your apartment this New Year, then the techniques mentioned above can help you in accomplishing that task. By following the right techniques and putting in some effort, you can completely change the look of your apartment. Once your apartment has been revamped, you will start looking forward to the rest of the year. So make the right move in the first month of this year and revamp your apartment.

Updated For the past seven years, millions of Intel chips have harbored a security flaw that can be potentially exploited to remotely control and infect systems with spyware.
Specifically, the bug is in Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT), Standard Manageability (ISM) and Small Business Technology (SBT) firmware versions 6 to 11.6. According to Chipzilla, the security hole allows "an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by these products."
That means it is possible for hackers to log into a vulnerable computer's hardware – right under the nose of the operating system – and silently tamper with the machine, install virtually undetectable malware, and so on, using AMT's features. This is potentially possible across the network because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware.
These insecure management features have been available in various, but not all, Intel chipsets for nearly a decade, starting with 2010's Intel Q57 family, all the way up to this year's Kaby Lake Core parts. Crucially, the vulnerability lies at the very heart of a machine's silicon, out of sight of the operating system, its applications and any antivirus.
The programming blunder can only be fully addressed with a firmware-level update, and it is present in millions of chips. It is effectively a backdoor into computers all over the world.
The vulnerable AMT service is part of Intel's vPro suite of processor features. If vPro is present and enabled on a system, and AMT is provisioned, unauthenticated miscreants on your network can access the computer's AMT controls and hijack them. If AMT isn't provisioned, a logged-in user can still potentially exploit the bug to gain admin-level powers. If you don't have vPro or AMT present at all, you are in the clear.
Intel reckons the vulnerability affects business and some server boxes, because they tend to have vPro and AMT present and enabled, and not systems aimed at ordinary folks, which typically don't. You can follow this document to check if your system is vulnerable – and you should.
Basically, if you're using a machine with vPro and AMT features enabled, you are at risk. Modern Apple Macs, although they use Intel chips, do not ship with the AMT software, and are thus in the clear.
According to Intel today, this critical security vulnerability, labeled CVE-2017-5689, was discovered and reported in March by Maksim Malyutin at Embedi. To get Intel's patch to close the hole, you'll have to pester your machine's manufacturer for a firmware update, and in the meantime, try the mitigations here. These updates, although developed by Intel, must be cryptographically signed and distributed by the manufacturers. It is hoped they will be pushed out to customers within the next few weeks. They should be installed ASAP.
"In March 2017 a security researcher identified and reported to Intel a critical firmware vulnerability in business PCs and devices that utilize Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), or Intel Small Business Technology (SBT)," an Intel spokesperson told The Register.
"Consumer PCs are not impacted by this vulnerability. We are not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability. We have implemented and validated a firmware update to address the problem, and we are cooperating with equipment manufacturers to make it available to end-users as soon as possible."
Specifically, according to Intel:
An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM).
An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology (SBT).
Apparently, Intel's Small Business Technology is not vulnerable to privilege escalation via the network. Whether you're using AMT, ISM or SBT, the fixed firmware versions to look out for are, depending on the processor family affected:
First-gen Core family: 6.2.61.3535
Second-gen Core family: 7.1.91.3272
Third-gen Core family: 8.1.71.3608
Fourth-gen Core family: 9.1.41.3024 and 9.5.61.3012
Fifth-gen Core family: 10.0.55.3000
Sixth-gen Core family: 11.0.25.3001
Seventh-gen Core family: 11.6.27.3264
Judging from Intel's statement, It's now up to computer makers to distribute the digitally signed firmware patches for people and IT admins to install. That means if your hardware supplier is a big name like Dell, one of the HPs, or Lenovo, you'll hopefully get an update shortly. If it's a no-name white box slinger, you're likely screwed: things like security and cryptography and firmware distribution is too much hard work in this low-margin business. You may never get the patches you need, in other words.
What is AMT?
AMT is an out-of-band management tool accessed via network port 16992 to the machine's wired Ethernet interface: it lays bare complete control of a system to the network, allowing IT bods and other sysadmins to reboot, repair and tweak boxes remotely. It can provide a virtual serial console or full-blown remote desktop access via VNC. God help you if this service is exposed to the public internet.
It is supposed to require a password before granting access, but the above bug means an attacker can waltz up to the hardware's control panel, unauthenticated. Even if you've firewalled off your systems' AMT access from the outer world, someone or malware within your network – say on a reception desk PC – can potentially exploit this latest vulnerability to drill deep into AMT-managed workstations and small servers, and further compromise your business.
AMT is software that runs on Intel's Management Engine (ME), a technology that has been embedded in its chipsets in one way or another for over a decade, since around the time the Core 2 landed in 2006. It operates at what's called ring -2, below the operating system kernel, and below any hypervisor on the box. It is basically a second computer within your computer, and it has full access to the network, peripherals, memory, storage and processors. Amusingly, early engines were powered by an ARC CPU core, which has a 16- and 32-bit hybrid architecture, and is a close relative to the Super FX chip used in Super Nintendo games such as Star Fox. Yes, the custom chip doing the 3D math in Star Fox and Stunt Race FX is an ancestor of the ARC microprocessor secretly and silently controlling your Intel x86 tin. These days, the Management Engine uses a SPARC core.
Details of Intel's ME have been trickling out into the open over the past few years: Igor Skochinsky gave a super talk in 2014 about it, for instance. The ARC core runs a ThreadX RTOS from SPI flash. It has direct access to the Ethernet controller. These days it is built into the Platform Controller Hub, an Intel microchip that contains various hardware controllers and is connected to the main processors on the motherboard.
The ME is a black box that Intel doesn't like to talk about too much, although it is partially documented on Chipzilla's website. It freaks out privacy and security conscious people: no one quite knows what the engine is really doing, and if it can be truly disabled, as it runs so close to the bare metal in computers.
On some Intel chip families, you can kill the ME with extreme prejudice by strategically wiping parts of the motherboard flash.
For years now, engineers and infosec types have been warning that, since all code has bugs, at least one remotely exploitable programming blunder must be present in Intel's AMT software, and the ME running it, and thus there must be a way to fully opt out of it: to buy a chipset with it not present at all, rather than just disabled or disconnected by a hardware fuse.
Finding a bug like this is like finding a hardwired, unremovable and remotely accessible administrator account, with the username and password "hackme", in Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Except this Intel flaw is in the chipset, running out of reach of your mortal hands, and now we wait for the cure to arrive from the computer manufacturers.
Is a big deal? "Yes," said Linux kernel guru Matthew Garrett, who posted some more technical information about the vulnerability, here.
"Fixing this requires a system firmware update in order to provide new ME firmware, including an updated copy of the AMT code. Many of the affected machines are no longer receiving firmware updates from their manufacturers, and so will probably never get a fix.
"Anyone who ever enables AMT on one of these devices will be vulnerable. That's ignoring the fact that firmware updates are rarely flagged as security critical (they don't generally come via Windows update), so even when updates are made available, users probably won't know about them or install them." ®
Updated to add
Embedi, whose security researcher found and reported the flaw, has shed some more light on the bug, such as clarifying the flaw has been present in Intel's chipsets since 2010.
When I moved to the midwest I was introduced to Crock Pot cooking. I had never even seen a slow cooker before and had no idea the range of foods that could be created in a plug-in cooking pot. Since then I have had everything from No-Peek-Chicken, Swedish Meatballs and Peach cobbler, done in one of these magic devices. When my husband was an art director Aveda they had “crock pot parties,” which meant everyone plugged in their slow cookers at their desks and made a dish to share. Brilliant! Maybe kids should bring crock pots to school and have healthy food cooking at their desks.
But, bread in a crock pot? Over the years we have gotten requests from readers to develop a method of baking our dough in a crock pot. I had my doubts, lots of them. I didn't think the slow cooker could get hot enough, I thought it would take too long, I didn't think it would bake through or have a nice crust and I resisted trying it. I was so convinced it would be a fail. Oh, how wrong I was. The crock pot does indeed get hot enough, and it takes less time than using your oven, because the rising time is included in the baking. The only thing I got right was the crust, it is very soft and quite pale when it comes out of the slow cooker, but just a few minutes under a broiler and I got a gorgeous loaf. I am a convert and it is just perfect for summer baking when you don't want to heat up your oven. You could even amaze your friends at work by baking a loaf under your desk! *
1 pound dough (Click here for our No-Knead 5-Minute Bread Recipe. I used the Peasant Bread from The New Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day, but the recipes from Healthy Bread in Five Minutes a Day would also work.)
Form the dough into a ball and place it on a sheet of parchment paper. Lower the dough into the Crock-Pot (Slow Cooker), mine is a 4-quart, but I think it will work in any size.
Update: I just mixed up a fresh batch of ABin5 Peasant Bread Dough, let it rise for the two hours in the bucket, then formed a 1-pound loaf and stuck it in the crock pot. So, you can use fresh or refrigerated dough.
Turn the temperature to high and put on the cover. (Not all crock pots behave the same, so you should keep an eye on the loaf after about 45 minutes to make sure it is not over browning on the bottom or not browning at all. You may need to adjust the time according to your machine.)
Bake for 1 hour (this will depend on your crock pot, you may need to increase or decrease the time. If you are using a 100% whole grain dough, you may want to go for a bit longer as well). You will have a fully baked loaf of bread, but the crust is very soft, almost like a steamed bun. To check for doneness I poked the top of the loaf and it felt firm. Before it is fully baked it felt soft and almost mushy when I gently pressed the top.
The bottom crust should be nice and crisp, but the top of the loaf will be quite soft. Some folks desire a softer crust, so you will love this loaf. If you want a darker or crisper crust…
Stick the bread under the broiler for 5 minutes or until it is the color you like, with the rack positioned in the middle of the oven.
Let the loaf cool completely before slicing. Cutting into a hot loaf is tempting, but it may seem gummy and under-baked.
It is fantastic with butter or as a sandwich. I love this method!

*Check with your crock-pot's manufacturer before trying this, since some model's instructions specify that the pot has to be at least partially filled with liquid to avoid safety or durability problems. And never bake in a crock-pot unattended.
Across history and cultures, religion increases trust within groups but also may increase conflict with other groups, according to an article in a special issue of Science.
"Moralizing gods, emerging over the last few millennia, have enabled large-scale cooperation and sociopolitical conquest even without war," says University of Michigan anthropologist Scott Atran, lead author of the article with Jeremy Ginges of the New School for Social Research.
"Sacred values sustain intractable conflicts like those between the Israelis and the Palestinians that defy rational, business-like negotiation. But they also provide surprising opportunities for resolution."
As evidence for their claim that religion increases trust within groups but may increase conflict with other groups, Atran and Ginges cite a number of studies among different populations. These include cross-cultural surveys and experiments in dozens of societies showing that people who participate most in collective religious rituals are more likely to cooperate with others, and that groups most intensely involved in conflict have the costliest and most physically demanding rituals to galvanize group solidarity in common defense and blind group members to exit strategies. Secular social contracts are more prone to defection, they argue. Their research also indicates that participation in collective religious ritual increases parochial altruism and, in relevant contexts, support for suicide attacks.
They also identify what they call the "backfire effect," which dooms many efforts to broker peace. In many studies that Atran and Ginges carried out with colleagues in Palestine, Israel, Iran, India, Indonesia and Afghanistan, they found that offers of money or other material incentives to compromise sacred values increased anger and opposition to a deal.
"In a 2010 study, Iranians who regarded Iran's right to a nuclear program as a sacred value more violently opposed sacrificing Iran's nuclear program for conflict-resolution deals involving substantial economic aid, or relaxation of sanctions, than the same deals without aid or sanctions," they write. "In a 2005 study in the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian refugees who held their 'right of return' to former homes in Israel as a sacred value more violently opposed abandoning this right for a Palestinian state plus substantial economic aid than the same peace deal without aid."
This dynamic is behind the paradoxical reality that the world finds itself in today: "Modern multiculturalism and global exposure to multifarious values is increasingly challenged by fundamentalist movements to revive primary group loyalties through greater ritual commitments to ideological purity."
But Atran and Ginges also offer some insights that could help to solve conflicts fueled by religious conviction. Casting these conflicts as sacred initially blocks standard business-like negotiation tactics. But making strong symbolic gestures such as sincere apologies and demonstrations of respect for the other's values generates surprising flexibility, even among militants and political leaders, and may enable subsequent material negotiations, they point out.
"In an age where religious and sacred causes are resurgent, there is urgent need for joint scientific effort to understand them," they conclude. "In-depth ethnography, combined with cognitive and behavioral experiments among diverse societies (including those lacking a world religion), can help identify and isolate the moral imperatives for decisions on war or peace."

A wearable gym? Discreet armband uses the power of MAGNETS to provide the same workout as a 24kg dumbbell
The O2 Magnetic Dumbbell, developed by students in South Korea, is embedded with electromagnets that provide a push and pull resistance
The intensity of a workout can be set by adjusting the level of electric power with weight training ranging from between 3kg to 24kg
Weight training conjures images of large sweaty men heaving even larger weights.
But an armband-like device could change all that by letting you lift up to 24kg without the use of large equipment.
The O2 Magnetic Dumbbell allows users to do a full and adjustable programme of weight training using the power of magnets.
The O2 Magnetic Dumbbell claims to do away with local gyms by meeting the needs of different training intensity levels
The two rings, designed by South Korean students, are worn above and below the elbow.
They are powered by embedded electromagnets that provide varying degrees of push and pull resistance.
The dumbbells claim to provide the user with all the benefits of traditional dumbbells without the effort of changing equipment for each exercise.

Do you have an Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.4, and you just bought a new iOS device? If so, you've probably noticed you can't sync that new iPad, iPod, or iPhone to Mac OS X… but don't despair, try calling AppleCare Support (1-800-275-2273) and you might be eligible for a free upgrade from Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.
While this isn't widely confirmed yet, TUAW is reporting that one of their readers received a free update to Leopard from Tiger courtesy of Apple:
if you find yourself …with a new iOS device that requires Leopard/iTunes 10 for sync support, but still running Tiger on your Intel Mac… call AppleCare. They say that Apple's support team will ask you for your iPhone/iPad/iPod touch serial number… and then send you a copy of Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, free of charge.
The reason for the free upgrade is simple: new iOS devices require iTunes 10 to sync to a Mac, but iTunes 10 requires at least Mac OS X 10.5 in order to run.
Now, on a related note… you can upgrade directly from Mac OS X 10.4 to Mac OS X 10.6 using a Snow Leopard installation DVD, these sell for $29 on Amazon with free shipping .
My opinion is that 10.6 Snow Leopard is a far superior Operating System to Leopard, so I think if you're still on 10.4 it's well worth the $29. On the other hand, it's hard to argue with the price of free so if the free 10.5 Leopard upgrades continue to be offered by Apple, you might as well take advantage of that too.
Wellington City Council has problems with implementing its planned IT systems overhaul, dubbed Project Odyssey. Contractors have not been paid, and phase two of the $19.75m project has been put on hold.
Plans to introduce an expensive IT system to make life simpler for Wellington ratepayers are in disarray after software glitches and staffing problems.
Wellington City Council has spent more than $15 million on the three-phase Project Odyssey so far but, a year after its introduction, phase two is on hold after problems with phase one.
The system, provided by Australian company TechnologyOne, is meant to merge all the council's main business functions, including rates, consents, dog registration, HR and payroll, into a single platform called One Council.
SUPPLIED Australian company TechnologyOne was charged with merging the council's customer service, land, property, regulatory, assets, finance, HR and payroll functions onto a single platform called One Council.
But when it was rolled out last July, businesses supplying services to the council were left unpaid after the system neglected to pay their bills.
Information obtained from a Local Government Official Information Meetings Act request found the problem with the first phase of Project Odyssey was related to the validation of purchase order numbers for invoices.
If there was any differentiation in the format of numbers or dates, there would be delays in processing because of "incorrect details".
CAMERON BURNELL/ STUFF Dog registrations, as well as rates and resource consents, were supposed to be made easier by the stalled phase two of Project Odyssey.
The system used electronic scanning, which resulted in process issues for suppliers and council staff.

Audit documents say a high-level review of phase one noted issues with the quality of reporting to groups of senior staff and experts who were overseeing Odyssey, and wider structural changes in the council.
The council was given recommendations to improve project management, governance structures and reporting.
It has budgeted $19.75m for the implementation of the three-phase project, and has spent $15.6m so far. However, phase two has been stalled, and the council has terminated the contracts of five contractors to save costs.
It expects to remain within the $19.75m budget, despite the delays.
Phase two would have replaced systems used for property and rating, and those dealing resource and building consents, public health and dog licences, but its implementation has been stalled.

Council chief financial officer Andy Matthews said the council was still committed to phase two, but had yet to finalise a schedule because it wanted to be confident a new version of software would work.
Some suppliers were still getting used to the new invoice requirement in phase one, they said.
Delays with payments last year and earlier this year happened while staff and suppliers got used to the system, but performance percentages had gradually been improving.
"It did take some time for staff and suppliers to get used to the new purchase order numbering system … We've ironed out the initial glitches caused by new processes.
"We are continuing to focus on training of council staff, and engaging with suppliers to further improve our process."
They would not say how many businesses or people were affected by the problem, and said there were no outstanding payments.
Someone had been employed to deal specifically with the project and train staff.
"We have worked hard over the past year to train staff and suppliers to use the system correctly. We fully understand the financial and emotional stress that suppliers and contractors – especially individuals and small companies – are subjected to when they are paid late, which is why we have focused on ensuring any process issues are resolved quickly."
TechnologyOne was preparing to release a new version of software called CiAnywhere, which would enable easier collection and immediate use of data, the ability to use different devices, and flexible working options for staff.
"We will not be rushing this as we want to be sure the new software meets our needs and that of our customers and ratepayers before implementing it," Matthews said.
Most phase three was set to go live in the next few months, which included asset resilience and new budgeting and performance planning systems.
Ida B. Wells-Barnett with their children Charles, Herman, Ida, and Alfreda, 1909
Ida B. Wells faced challenges that many women know well: they had to balance their organizing zeal with raising a family.
In 1895, Wells married attorney Ferdinand L. Barnett, a widower with two sons, Ferdinand and Albert. They were one of the first married American women to keep their own last name as well as taking their husband's The couple had four more children: Charles, Herman, Ida, and Alfreda. In the chapter of their Crusade For Justice autobiography, called A Divided Duty, Wells described the difficulty they had splitting their time between their family and their work. They continued to work after the birth of their first child, traveling and bringing the infant Charles with them Although they tried to balance their world, they could not be as active in their work. Susan B. Anthony said they seemed "distracted". After having their second child, Wells stepped out of their touring and public life for a time.
Alfreda M. Duster, the daughter of Ida B. Wells and Ferdinand L. Barnett, was the editor of their mother's autobiography Crusade for Justice: The Autobiography of Ida B. Wells.
Towards the end of their life, realizing that their work was already becoming forgotten history, Ida B. Wells wrote the massive, unfinished memoirs that form Crusade for Justice. An outspoken and determined woman with seemingly limitless energy, Ida B. Wells began their crusade against the oppression of black people in 1884, when, at the age of sixteen, they sued the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad for evicting them from a first class car. A teacher and journalist, they began a one-woman anti-lynching campaign after a close friend was murdered. They traveled throughout England and later in the United States gaining support; got married; began the first clubs for black women in the US; started a reading room, shelter, and employment service for black men in Chicago; investigated race riots; and had six children. Them children and husband (she refers to them as "Mr. Barnett") remain almost invisible in this book, but what Crusade for Justice lacks in domestic detail, it makes up for in personal opinion. Ida B. Wells was a forthright woman who worked with many famous leaders of the early twentieth century, and they do not hesitate either to blast their opponents or to praise those who earn their respect - including President Wilson, Booker T. Washington, Susan B. Anthony, and Frederick Douglass. Them history is packed with facts not often taught in schools and filled with the fervor of a woman who spent their life proving that one person can and must make a difference
I wrote “Ida Bell Wells-Barnett was a lioness” two years ago for Black Kos, and am I republishing portions of that piece here:
They would not be silent
For speaking plainly about rape, sex and murder, Wells lost their home and their livelihood. For the rest of their life, they had to defend their reputation against both white and black people who called them a "negro adventuress" and "Notorious Courtesan." A black newspaper editor suggested that the public should "muzzle" that "animal from Memphis," and the New York Times dubbed them “a slanderous and dirty-minded mulatress."
There are two biographies of them you should read. The first is Ida: A Sword Among Lions—Ida B. Wells and the Campaign Against Lynching, by black historian Paula Giddings.
Heralded as a landmark achievement upon publication, Ida: A Sword Among Lions is a sweeping narrative about a country and a crusader embroiled in the struggle against lynching—a practice that imperiled not only the lives of black men and women, but also a nation based on law and riven by race. At the center of the national drama is Ida B. Wells (1862-1931). Born to slaves in Mississippi, Wells began their activist career by refusing to leave a first-class ladies' car on a Memphis railway and rose to lead the nation's first campaign against lynching. For Wells, the key to the rise in violence was embedded in attitudes not only about black men, but also about women and sexuality. Them independent perspective and percussive personality gained their encomiums as a hero—as well as aspersions on their character and threats of death. Exiled from the South by 1892, Wells subsequently took their campaign across the country and throughout the British Isles before they married and settled in Chicago. There they continued their activism as a journalist, suffragist, and independent candidate in the rough-and-tumble world of the Windy City's politics. With meticulous research and vivid rendering of their subject, Giddings also provides compelling portraits of twentieth-century progressive luminaries, blacks and whites who worked with Wells during some of the most tumultuous periods in American history. In this groundbreaking work, Paula J. Giddings brings to life the irrepressible personality of Ida B. Wells and gives the visionary reformer them due.
They were also the subject of the documentary film Ida B. Wells: a Passion for Justice.

The second biography is To Tell the Truth Freely: The Life of Ida B. Wells, by Mia Bey.
Born to slaves in 1862, Ida B. Wells became a fearless anti-lynching crusader, women's rights advocate, and journalist. Wells's refusal to accept any compromise on racial inequality caused them to be labeled a “dangerous radical” in their day but made them a model for later civil rights activists as well as a powerful witness to the troubled racial politics of their era. Though they eventually helped found the NAACP in 1910, they would not remain a member for long, as they rejected not only Booker T. Washington's accommodationism but also the moderating influence of white reformers within the early NAACP. In the richly illustrated To Tell the Truth Freely, the historian Mia Bay vividly captures Wells's legacy and life, from their childhood in Mississippi to their early career in late-nineteenth-century Memphis and their later life in Progressive-era Chicago.
For Women's History Month, it is fitting that we look at Wells-Barnett through the lens of black female historians like Paula Giddings.
Professor Paula Giddings is the author of three books on the social and political history of African American women: When and Where I Enter: The Impact on Black Women on Race and Sex in America; In Search of Sisterhood: Delta Sigma Theta and the Challenge of the Black Sorority Movement; and, most recently, the critically acclaimed biography of anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells, Ida: A Sword among Lions.  They are also the editor of Burning All Illusions, an anthology of articles on race published by The Nation magazine from 1867 to 2000.  They are also a former book editor and journalist who has written extensively on international and national issues and has been published by the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Jeune Afrique (Paris), The Nation, and the journals Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism and Sage: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women, among other publications. Before attaining the position of professor of Afro-American studies at Smith College, Professor Giddings had taught at Spelman College, where they were a United Negro Fund Distinguished Scholar; Douglass College/Rutgers University as the Laurie Chair in Women's Studies; and Princeton and Duke Universities.
Mia Bey is another black woman historian.  They are ...
… a Professor of History and Director, Center for Race and Ethnicity at Rutgers University and has authored To Tell the Truth Freely: the Life of Ida B. Wells. Hill & Wang, February 2009.and The White Image in the Black Mind: African-American Ideas About White People 1830-1925. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.

At a time when we are faced with extreme and dangerous challenges, we need truth-tellers and crusaders like Wells—now more than ever.
They told us, “The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon them.”
Amen, Sister Wells. Amen.
RAIPUR: Police were in a fix on Monday after a 19-year-old girl first claimed that they were gang-raped by five youth, later denied it and frequently changed their statements about the alleged sexual assault. However, the police arrested all the accused on the basis of their statement.Civil Lines police, while patrolling late on Sunday night, found this girl in Shankar Nagar locality in a suspicious state. During questioning, they claimed that they were gang-raped by five youths, who took them to an isolated place.Based on the statement of the girl, who works in few shops in the area, police promptly lodged an FIR and all the accused were rounded up.A piquant situation arose when the girl retracted from their statement on Monday while taking to the media, claiming that all the five youth, named in their statement, were their friends and they didn't rape them However, the police searched the crime scene, as earlier described by the girl, and found contraceptives.Police sources claimed that the girl might have been physically involved with their boyfriend who later called their friends, who later gang-raped them Girl was under the influence of alcohol when police brought them to police station and the next day they must have changed their statement after sensing the seriousness of the issue.The decision on their altered statement would probably be put forward before a sub-divisional magistrate as per the provisions of law.Civil Lines town inspector Manisha Thakur said the five accused are Rahul Sahu, 19, Keshav Sahu, 21, Sonu Prajapati, 19 and Rohit Sahu, 19, all residents of Shakti Nagar. A case under Section 376 (2G) of the IPC was registered against them.
In defense of the PACE trial, Petrie and Weinman employ a series of misleading or fallacious argumentation techniques, including circularity, blaming the victim, bait and switch, non-sequitur, setting up a straw person, guilt by association, red herring, and the parade of horribles. These are described and explained.

After a day of outcry, upset and what's shaping up to be reddit's most downvoted comment ever, EA has responded to the fallout from Star Wars Battlefront 2's progression system, slashing hero costs so players can get their hands on characters such as Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker much, much quicker.
A part of the fallout around Star Wars Battlefront 2 emerged around the amount required to unlock heroes in the game - iconic characters who can be deployed at certain points during matches, and who are integral to the Heroes vs Villains mode. In EA's last Battlefront game, back in 2015, there was no unlock criteria for heroes - though there was the small issue of a season pass, with a large number of characters reserved for those who'd ponied up the extra amount.
Star Wars Battlefront 2 has done away with the season pass, but EA has fumbled in its replacement, introducing loot boxes that award credits and perks. Those loot boxes, combined with a new unlock system for heroes in which characters are acquired with in-game credits, has attracted no small amount of controversy in the run-up to release. Even though the heroes aren't explicitly tied into the loot boxes, they've been the subject of ire - especially given how the rate at which they're acquired was boosted dramatically from beta to the full retail version.
EA has been quick to address the hero problem, though, publishing a blog outlining immediate changes just prior to the game's release. Prices have been effectively quartered, with Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker now costing 15,000 credits as opposed to 60,000, Palpatine, Chewbacca and Leia available for 10,000 as opposed to 40,000 and Iden now available for 5,000. The change is effective immediately - so players who've bought the deluxe edition which unlocks tomorrow will get the new prices.
As well as those changes, executive producer John Wasilczyk will be taking part in a Reddit AMA this Wednesday as the company continues to court player feedback.
It's progress of sorts, and it shows that EA and DICE are listening. How will that impact those loot boxes themselves in the future? We'll likely soon find out. Star Wars Battlefront 2 is out for everyone on November 17th, and our review will be going live later tonight.

On CNN's front page, a poll is current running that indicates 44% of those who have so far voted favor “WaterBoarding” of individuals suspected of terrorism. This is an indication that the “Politics of Fear” are working, and Americans are not thinking this issue through, but are instead reacting to fear without understand the history of WaterBoarding, its history in regard the law, and the direct effect it could have on American prisoners of war.
Waterboarding Used to Be a Crime By Evan Wallach
Sunday, November 4, 2007; Page B01 First, WaterBoarding is considered torture, it's against international law and defies the Geneva Convention - which the United States was instrumental in forming and signed. It is bad enough that our President refuses to comply with our own rule of law, much less international law, however it's sad to note that their decision appears to enjoy support from those that may now understand the implications and danger of WaterBoarding. - Advertisement - The United States knows quite a bit about waterboarding. The U.S. government — whether acting alone before domestic courts, commissions and courts-martial or as part of the world community — has not only condemned the use of water torture but has severely punished those who applied it. After World War II, we convicted several Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American and Allied prisoners of war. At the trial of their captors, then-Lt. Chase J. Nielsen, one of the 1942 Army Air Forces officers who flew in the Doolittle Raid and was captured by the Japanese, testified: “I was given several types of torture. . . . I was given what they call the water cure.” They were asked what they felt when the Japanese soldiers poured the water. “Well, I felt more or less like I was drowning,” they replied, “just gasping between life and death.” Nielsen's experience was not unique. Nor was the prosecution of their captors. After Japan surrendered, the United States organized and participated in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, generally called the Tokyo War Crimes Trials. Leading members of Japan's military and government elite were charged, among their many other crimes, with torturing Allied military personnel and civilians. The principal proof upon which their torture convictions were based was conduct that we would now call waterboarding. MUCH MORE - Advertisement -
If more people knew these facts and the resulting international outrage, the danger it presents to our own troops when captured, but most of all, allowing us to apply a double-standard to ourselves when we have actually convicted others who have been guilty of this exact crime in wars that most of us no longer remember; we're better than that, and I would urge everyone to vote in that poll and express the outrage of a country that has for far too long ignored the rule of law and international treaties of which we were instrumental in creating and urging others to sign. The hypocrisy is staggering, and it does nothing to repair our image that many nations now label as “dangerous” and “imperialistic.”
I would urge anyone who is awake, now and tomorrow if the poll is still running to express our general outrage that our own country has violated our own, plus several international laws in the pursuit of Bush polices that continue to tarnish the image of the United States. Vote at CNN .

Grant Holt admits they are still developing as a player under Villa boss Paul Lambert – even as the oldest player in the claret and blue dressing room.
The 32-year-old target man was recruited for their experience during the January transfer window on a loan deal from Championship club Wigan until the end of the season.
But, although the average age of Lambert's squad is under 25, elder statesman Holt accepts they are still learning the game himself, especially at Premier League level.
“You never stop learning,” said Holt.
“It's always different when you come into a new team.
“You've got to learn quickly. It's going to take me a while to realise what certain people do, their different strengths, how different people play.
“That's the only way you'll get better by adapting to other people as well as looking after your own game.”
Holt is glad to be working with Lambert again, albeit on a temporary basis, having enjoyed three seasons of success with the Glaswegian gaffer at Norwich.
Lambert made Holt their captain at Carrow Road, and the well-travelled striker repaid their boss with three goal-laden seasons as the Canaries climbed from League One obscurity to Premier League respectability.
“He's pretty similar to how they were at Norwich,” said Holt.
“You know what to expect from him. They expect a level of performance and of endeavour in training and in games and he's not changed in that respect.
“If you don't buy into that then you're certainly not part of their thoughts. You've got to get there quickly, do things right and get up to speed.”
Having suffered an injury early in their Wigan career and become a peripheral figure with the Latics – scoring just two goals in 21 appearances – Holt already feels like one of the lads at Villa.
They have made three substitute appearances in the draw at Liverpool, win over West Bromwich Albion and defeat to West Bromwich Albion, as well as starting in the Premier League loss at Everton.
Holt is still waiting to open their claret and blues account and is set to be involved when Villa resume their Premier League campaign at Newcastle next Sunday after warm weather training in Portugal.
“It's been fantastic, the lads have been welcoming and I've settled in well,” they said. “I'm just enjoying it really.
“I'm glad to be involved with a bunch of lads who want to win games. The group that the gaffer's got here are fit and strong and that's what kind of side they like. It's nice to be part of something.
“To be back involved in the Premier League has given me that bit of belief. I hadn't started a game for three months before I came here so it's about finding your feet and keeping going and I've been happy with my performances.”
Holt was not the only short-term addition to Lambert's squad during the January transfer window, with defender Ryan Bertrand also arriving on a loan from Chelsea until the end of the season.
Bertrand, a Champions League winner with the Stamford Bridge club the season before last, will thrive at Villa alongside like-minded ambitious young players, according to wise veteran Holt.
“The thing with Ryan is he's won the highest honour you can get,” said Holt.

“He's won the Champions League and played for Chelsea and you don't get to do those things if you're not a very talented player.
“I think everyone knows that they are. In their time at Chelsea, they haven't had the run of games that they want and he's had some good loan moves.
“I think this will be a fabulous move for him. He's come into a bunch of young lads who are looking for the same thing as they are and their performances have been excellent.”
I've been all over the place fixing and improving things in various aspects of the game, so bear with me as I try to make this a concise post to read through. The big focus of this update is Trading, Constitution Changes, Quality of Life Improvements and Bugfixes.
Trading
This is the current interface for trading. It will get polished in future version, both aesthetically and functionally to add in a cursor and the usage counter on items and staves. It also needs a visual feedback when it's possible to cycle through allies to trade with. It's all a work in progress!
Constitution Changes
After a few tests, I noticed a Str/Mag-based Weight system was being completely useless after level 10, so I opted for the traditional Constitution system, which also ties in to the whole Rescue/Shove mechanic as well, so I'll elaborate a bit on that too along the way.
Constitution will be able to be buffed in multiple ways in WNHK. Equippable Items will allow to temporarily boost Constitution, for instance. There will also be an Attack Speed bonus linked to Weapon Rank as well as other variables to allow lower Con units to wield heavier weapons in a pinch.
Each class has a base Con, which is then modified by each unit's unique modifier. Aid depends on the type of class the unit is in.
Most foot units' Aid is equal to “Con – 2″
Rogues and frail Mages' Aid is equal to “Con – 3″
Armor Knights' Aid is equal to their Con.
Fighters and Brigands' Aid is equal to “Con +2″
Cavalier, Pegasus, Wyvern and Manticore Riders' Aid is equal to “30 – Con”
Griffin Riders' Aid is equal to “35 – Con”
Fixes and Improvements
Since there are quite a few, here is a list of all the improvements and fixes I've done throughout the past weeks.
Knives now show their added attack in the battle preparation screen distinctly from the regular dual strike icon
Enemy reinforcements' weapons do not cause a freeze
Weapon stat modifiers are taken into account when weapons are loaded from the database
Enemies now have the same potential skills as player units
Fixed an issue where any allied unit's death would cause a game over screen
Druid has been renamed to Cultist in order to better reflect the Dark nature of the class instead of the more Elemental nature of the typical Druid
Fixed issue where WTA was applied twice on counter attacks
Character Teaser
Last update featured Linus, the Fighter. Here is the fully colored version. We're working on another character named Dolores for the next update. Stay tuned!
Until next time,

Bacon. Just the mere sound of that word is enough to make some salivate -- the sound of the sizzle and pop as the breakfast meat cooks to crispy perfection, its scent wafting through the kitchen with the promise of a most satisfying meal.
Bacon holds a prized spot on the breakfast table as well as in many lunches, dinner and even dessert recipes. It is for this reason that you may want to ensure your bacon frying skills are solid. There is nothing worse than getting people's hopes up with the sight of bacon, only to disappoint them with soggy and fatty strips -- or even worse, strips so charred that they are only worthy of the trash bin. There are three preferred methods to choose from, all with their own perks. Read on for guidance on how to master these techniques -- and more importantly, learn what not to do.
Traditionalist like to cook their bacon strips in a frying pan. It could be that they enjoy the sounds and aromas released during this process, or they like to cook their eggs in the resulting bacon-greased pan, or maybe that is just they way they have always done it. Whatever the reason, there are important factors to consider with the traditionalist cooking method.
Cooking Instructions: First things first, start with a cold frying pan. If you add bacon to an already hot pan, you run the risk of scorching it. Take the bacon out of the fridge about five minutes before frying. This will bring the fat back to its natural state, making it more suitable for frying. Use a flat pan, preferably cast iron. Place enough bacon in the pan to fill it up, but not so much so that it overlaps. If it overlaps there will be sections of the bacon that isn't cooked. And if there is too much space in the pan, not enough bacon grease will be released into the pan and the bacon can burn. Once you have cooked both sides, take the bacon out of the pan. Serve immediately, or place on a plate with paper towels to collect the excess grease.
Pros: You get the pleasure of watching the bacon transform to crisp perfection. The aroma and sounds during cooking builds anticipation for the glorious meal about to occur. And, if you are not terribly health conscious, you are left with bacon grease to cook with.
Cons: There is a fairly high possibility for a subpar result -- especially if you do not feel confident in your bacon frying abilities. It is easy to burn or undercook -- and uneven cooking is a high risk.
Perfectionists like their bacon perfectly straight, perfectly crisp, every time. They don't want to mess around with a little bit crispy, a little bit not. And they surely do not appreciate it when their bacon twists and curls in all different directions. No. Perfectionists want their bacon to look like it does on TV commercials, and to taste like it does in restaurants. Perfectionists bake their bacon in the oven. This method is also used in most restaurants. Since chefs have to produce such large amounts of bacon, cooking on the range just isn't efficient.
Cooking Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Arrange the bacon on a slotted broiler tray (or something similar) with a catch tray beneath it for the bacon grease. Cook the bacon for about 10-15 minutes, but be sure to keep a close eye on it because bacon can go from crisp perfection to charred blackness in a matter of minutes.
Pros: Since the grease falls into another pan as the bacon cooks, this version is slightly less messy and less dangerous -- there is no worry of being burned by sputtering grease from the pan. With this method, bacon comes out evenly cooked, every time.
Cons: If you do not have a slotted broiler tray, or something similar, this method is not as clean and easy as one would like.
This cooking method is for those who are all about instant gratification. If you like your bacon and you want it fast, this is the method for you. Many people say that they cannot taste the difference between this fast method and the traditional fry pan method, but that is up for some debate. One thing we can say for sure about this preparation is that it is quick, easy and requires little fuss.
Cooking Instructions: All you need to get this done is a functioning microwave, a plate and a decent supply of paper towels. Cook for 4-6 minutes, depending on the power of your microwave. We recommend layering about three paper towels beneath the bacon strips and adding a couple on top too. This is essential. The paper towels need to soak up all the bacon grease that would normally be released into a pan so that it doesn't end up all over the microwave walls.
Pros: Fast and easy. Anyone with the slightest bit of experience in the kitchen can make a decent batch. And, it does not leave you with a hefty amount of bacon grease to deal with.
Cons: Well, it has been nuked. But if that doesn't bother you, then you may have found the perfect method.
With all that said, you are now ready to cook bacon. Check out some of our favorite ways to use it.

FORMER Labour councillor Kevin Bennett, who resigned from the party last week, has confirmed they will stand in Warrington at the General Election in May.
The Fairfield and Howley member will stand in Warrington South though rather than Warrington North, where their ward lies.
It is a blow to Nick Bent, the Labour candidate for the seat, who is expected to be in a tight tussle with David Mowat for the Conservatives and Bob Barr for the Liberal Democrats.
They will stand for the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition.
Cllr Bennett said: "Following my resignation from the Labour Party, brought about by almost five years of bullying, intimidation and the two years suspension, also not being allowed to speak up for the people I represent by the Warrington Labour Group,
"I have decided to stand as a Trade Unionist & Socialist Coalition (TUSC) Parliamentary Candidate for Warrington South.
"I want to give the people of Warrington South a real choice, because one thing is clear about the outcome of the 2015 General Election, whichever one of the ‘establishment' parties, or even a coalition, they will continue with policies favouring the rich, and austerity for the rest of us.
"The people of Warrington South deserve the chance to vote against austerity.
"I will be the only candidate who, along with my wife and two children, was born and raised in Warrington, went to school and college in Warrington and I have worked in and around Warrington all my life.
"I will be a strong voice for the people of Warrington South because what affects them, affects me and my family, therefore they can be assured that I am not a ‘career politician' and I would spend as much time in Warrington as possible, listening to and understanding what the problems are in Warrington South."
A public meeting will be held on February 18 at 7pm, anyone interested in attending should call 07789 617386 or kevinbennett396@btinternet.com.
Lockheed Martin First Defense Contractor To Utilize Blockchain Technology
Maryland-based defense contractor Lockheed Martin has entered into an agreement with cybersecurity company Guardtime Federal in order to incorporate various digital security elements including Guardtime's blockchain-based infrastructure to improve its systems engineering processes, supply chain management, and software development efforts.
The contracted collaboration between Lockheed Martin and Guardtime Federal comes as a result of around two years of research and tests into the capabilities of data integrity technology, such as immutable distributed ledger technology, as a defense against misrepresentation or falsification of data in sensitive networked systems and weapon embedded cyber-physical systems. The two firms have also looked into the effects of data mismanagement through the development cycle as a whole and for ways to mitigate the challenge.
Virginia-based Guardtime Federal is a leading cybersecurity supplier which was previously awarded a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contract in order to make advancements in blockchain-based integrity monitoring programs and formal verification tools. The undertaking will be based on Guardtime Federal's Black Lantern appliances and the countrywide disseminated Guardtime Federal Core Blockchain infrastructure, making Lockheed Martin the first defense contractor in the U.S. to publicly announce that they will incorporate blockchain technology into its operations.
To adequately fulfill the requirements of the project, Guardtime Federal created an association made up of small cyber-based businesses each with advanced technological innovations in this field. The three companies are Galois, Trail of Bits, and ForAllSecure. Since the three companies are participants in Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) cyber-related actions, there is great knowledge on the ins and outs of systems vulnerabilities and how to address any weaknesses.
David Hamilton, president of Guardtime Federal, spoke of the consortium saying “Guardtime Federal is excited about collaborating with such a high-quality team for delivering capabilities to Lockheed Martin with whom we share a common vision regarding cyber and software development challenges.”
Guardtime Federal and Lockheed Martin are in the final stages of creating what they refer to as Cyber Aware Systems Engineering. This program is designed to find weaknesses in a system in a quick manner in order for solutions to be found quicker, thus the data has a greater chance of secure storage.
“These new cybersecurity approaches will enhance data integrity, speed problem discovery, and mitigation, and reduce the volume of regression testing, which results in reduced schedule risk.The faster our developers can discover issues, the faster we can deliver,” said Ron Bessire, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics' Engineering and Technology Vice President.
The cybersecurity industry is one of many industries that are testing blockchain solutions to meet industry needs. The immutability of a well-developed distributed ledger is the key ingredient of blockchain technology that draws cybersecurity firms to this new technology in the hope to develop new systems that will prevent harm from the growing global cybersecurity threat.
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Children who drink soda tend to score slightly higher on scales that measure aggressive behavior than kids who don't drink the carbonated beverages, according to a new study.

The study's lead author cautioned, however, that the increase may not be noticeable for individual children and the researchers can't prove soda caused the bad behaviors.
“It's a little hard to interpret it. It's not quite clinically significant,” Shakira Suglia, of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, told Reuters Health.
Previous work by some of the study's authors had found connections between soda drinking and violent behavior, but the link had not been studied in young children.
For the new analysis, the researchers used an existing study of mothers and their 2,929 children from 20 large U.S. cities. The mothers and children were first recruited between 1998 and 2000 to be periodically interviewed and evaluated.
Mothers completed a checklist on children's behaviors over the previous two months to measure withdrawal, attention and aggression.
“It's things like how often does a child destroy their or their own belongings and how often do they destroy the belongings of others,” Suglia said.
The mothers were also asked how many servings of soda their children drank per day and about other habits such as TV watching.
Overall, 43 percent of the kids drank at least one soda per day and 4 percent drank four or more servings.
Aggressive behavior was measured on a scale between 0 and 100 - with higher scores indicating more aggression. Suglia said the average score is 50, and 65 is usually used as a clinical marker of when children should be evaluated for a problem.
Kids who reportedly drank no soda scored 56 on the aggression scale, on average. That compared to 57 among kids who drank one serving per day, 58 among those who drank two servings, 59 among those who drank three servings and 62 for four soda servings or more per day.
After taking into account habits that may have influenced the results - such as how much TV the kids watched, how much candy they ate and their mother's race and education - the researchers still found that drinking two or four or more servings of soda per day was tied to higher aggression scores.
Overall, kids who drank four or more servings of soda per day were twice as likely to destroy other people's belongings, get into fights and physically attack people, compared to children who didn't drink soda.
Soda drinkers also scored higher on scales measuring signs of withdrawal and attention problems, write the researchers in The Journal of Pediatrics.
Suglia said that although the increased aggressive behavior may not be noticeable for each child, it's moving all kids closer to the scale's clinical threshold.
“Furthermore, if they're drinking this much soda, it's probably taking away from other nutritional things the child could be eating,” they said.
The researchers write that they can't tell from their study what may explain the association between soda and behavior problems in children, but one possibility is that an ingredient in soda - like caffeine or high fructose corn syrup - could directly increase aggression.
Another possibility, however, is that an underlying condition - such as low blood sugar - could make kids more aggressive and make them crave soda and sweets, they add.
Suglia also said it's important to note that the results may not apply to the general population, because most of the mothers were single and African American or Latina.
Despite those limitations, Janet Fischel, director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics in the department of pediatrics at Stony Brook University School of Medicine in New York, said the study is a step in the right direction.
“I think it's really important and a giant first step in gathering an evidence base for what's becoming a very widespread dietary habit. I think that's really important,” Fischel, who wasn't involved in the new study, said.

Ten days into the uprising in Benghazi, Libya, the United Nations' Human Rights Council established the International Commission of Inquiry on Libya. The purpose of the Commission was to “investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law in Libya.” The broad agenda was to establish the facts of the violations and crimes and to take such actions as to hold the identified perpetrators accountable. On June 15, the Commission presented its first report to the Council. This report was provisional, since the conflict was still ongoing and access to the country was minimal. The June report was no more conclusive than the work of the human rights non-governmental organizations (such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch). In some instances, the work of investigators for these NGOs (such as Donatella Rovera of Amnesty) was of higher quality than that of the Commission.
Due to the uncompleted war and then the unsettled security state in the country in its aftermath, the Commission did not return to the field till October 2011, and did not begin any real investigation before December 2011. On March 2, 2012, the Commission finally produced a two hundred-page document that was presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Little fanfare greeted this report's publication, and the HRC's deliberation on it was equally restrained.
Nonetheless, the report is fairly revelatory, making two important points: first, that all sides on the ground committed war crimes with no mention at all of a potential genocide conducted by the Qaddafi forces; second, that there remains a distinct lack of clarity regarding potential NATO war crimes. Not enough can be made of these two points. They strongly inferthat the rush to a NATO “humanitarian intervention” might have been made on exaggerated evidence, and that NATO's own military intervention might have been less than “humanitarian” in its effects.
It is precisely because of a lack of accountability by NATO that there is hesitancy in the United Nations Security Council for a strong resolution on Syria. “Because of the Libyan experience,” the Indian Ambassador to the UN Hardeep Singh Puri told me in February, “other members of the Security Council, such as China and Russia, will not hesitate in exercising a veto if a resolution – and this is a big if – contains actions under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, which permits the use of force and punitive and coercive measures.”
Crimes Against Humanity.
The Libyan uprising began on February 15, 2011. By February 22, the UN Human Rights Chief Navi Pillay claimed that two hundred and fifty people had been killed in Libya, “although the actual numbers are difficult to verify.” Nonetheless, Pillay pointed to “widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population” which “may amount to crimes against humanity.” Pillay channeled the Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN from Libya, Ibrahim Dabbashi, who had defected to the rebellion and claimed, “Qaddafi had started the genocide against the Libyan people.” Very soon world leaders used the two concepts interchangeably, “genocide” and “crimes against humanity.” These concepts created a mood that Qaddafi's forces were either already indiscriminately killing vast numbers of people, or that they were poised for a massacre of Rwanda proportions.
Courageous work by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch last year, then much later the 2012 report from the UN belies this judgment, (as does my forthcoming book Arab Spring, Libyan Winter, AK Press), which goes through the day-by-day record and show two things: that both sides used excessive violence and that the rebels seemed to have the upper hand for much of the conflict, with Qaddafi's forces able to recapture cities, but unable to hold them.
The UN report is much more focused on the question of crimes committed on the ground. This is the kind of forensic evidence in the report:
(1) In the military base and detention camp of Al Qalaa. “Witnesses, together with the local prosecutor, uncovered the bodies of 43 men and boys, blindfolded and with their hands tied behind their backs.” Qaddafi forces had shot them. Going over many of these kinds of incidents, and of indiscriminate firing of heavy artillery into cities, the UN Report notes that these amount to a war crime or a crime against humanity.
(2) “Over a dozen Qadhafi soldiers were reportedly shot in the back of the head by thuwar [rebel fighters] around 22-23 February 2011 in a village between Al Bayda and Darnah. This is corroborated by mobile phone footage.” After an exhaustive listing of the many such incidents, and of the use of heavy artillery against cities notably Sirte, the UN report suggests the preponderance of evidence of the war crime of murder or crimes against humanity.
There is no mention of genocide in the Report, and none of any organized civilian massacre. This is significant because UN Resolution 1973, which authorized the NATO war, was premised on the “the widespread and systematic attacks currently taking place in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya against the civilian population” which “may amount to crimes against humanity.” There was no mention in Resolution 1973 of the disproportionate violence of the thuwar against the pro-Qaddafi population (already reported by al-jazeera by February 19), a fact that might have given pause to the UN as it allowed NATO to enter the conflict on the rebels' behalf. NATO's partisan bombardment allowed the rebels to seize the country faster than they might have had in a more protracted war, but it also allowed them carte blanche to continue with their own crimes against humanity.
With NATO backing, it was clear that no one was going to either properly investigate the rebel behavior, and no-one was going to allow for a criminal prosecution of those crimes against humanity. Violence of this kind by one's allies is never to be investigated as the Allies found out after World War 2 when there was no assessment of the criminal firebombing of, for example, Dresden. No wonder that the UN Report notes that the Commissioners are “deeply concerned that no independent investigation or prosecution appear to have been instigated into killings committed by thuwar.” None is likely. There are now over eight thousand pro-Qaddafi fighters in Libyan prisons. They have no charges framed against them. Many have been tortured, and several have died (including Halah al-Misrati, the Qaddafi era newscaster).
The section of the UN report on the town of Tawergha is most startling. The thirty thousand residents of the town were removed by the Misratan thuwar. The general sentiment among the Misratan thuwar was that the Tawerghans were given preferential treatment by the Qaddafi regime, a claim disputed by the Tawerghans. The road between Misrata and Tawergha was lined with slogans such as “the brigade for purging slaves, black skin,” indicating the racist cleansing of the town. The section on Tawergha takes up twenty pages of the report. It is chilling reading. Tawerghans told the Commission “that during ‘interrogations' they were beaten, had hot wax poured in their ears and were told to confess to committing rape in Misrata. The Commission was told that one man had diesel poured on to their back which was then set alight; the same man was held in shackles for 12 days.” This goes on and on. The death count is unclear. The refugees are badly treated as they go to Benghazi and Tripoli.
To the Commission, the attacks against Tawerghans during the war “constitute a war crime” and those that have taken place since “violate international human rights law” and a “crime against humanity.” Because of the “current difficulties faced by the Libyan Government,” the Commission concludes, it is unlikely that the government will be able to bring justice for the Tawerghans and to undermine the “culture of impunity that characterizes the attacks.”
NATO's Crimes.
For the past several months, the Russians have asked for a proper investigation through the UN Security Council of the NATO bombardment of Libya. “There is great reluctance to undertake it,” the Indian Ambassador to the UN told me. When the NATO states in the Security Council wanted to clamor for war in February-March 2011, they held discussions about Libya in an open session. After Resolution 1973 and since the war ended, the NATO states have only allowed discussion about Libya in a closed session. When Navi Pillay came to talk about the UN Report, their remarks were not for the public.
Indeed, when it became clear to NATO that the UN Commission wished to investigate NATO's role in the Libyan war, Brussels balked. On February 15, 2012, NATO's Legal Adviser Peter Olson wrote a strong letter to the Chair of the Commission. NATO accepted that the Qaddafi regime “committed serious violations of international law,” which led to the Security Council Resolution 1973. What was not acceptable was any mention of NATO's “violations” during the conflict,
“We would be concerned, however, if ‘NATO incidents' were included in the Commission's report as on a par with those which the Commission may ultimately conclude did violate law or constitute crimes. We note in this regard that the Commission's mandate is to discuss ‘the facts and circumstance of….violations [of law] and…crimes perpetrated.' We would accordingly request that, in the event the Commission elects to include a discussion of NATO actions in Libya, its report clearly state that NATO did not deliberately target civilians and did not commit war crimes in Libya.”
To its credit, the Commission did discuss the NATO “incidents.” However, there were some factual problems. The Commission claimed that NATO flew 17,939 armed sorties in Libya. NATO says that it flew “24,200 sorties, including over 9,000 strike sorties.” What the gap between the two numbers might tell us is not explored in the report or in the press discussion subsequently. The Commission points out that NATO did strike several civilian areas (such as Majer, Bani Walid, Sirte, Surman, Souq al-Juma) as well as areas that NATO claims were “command and control nodes.” The Commission found no “evidence of such activity” in these “nodes.” NATO contested both the civilian deaths and the Commission's doubts about these “nodes.” Because NATO would not fully cooperate with the Commission, the investigation was “unable to determine, for lack of sufficient information, whether these strikes were based on incorrect or outdated intelligence and, therefore, whether they were consistent with NATO's objective to take all necessary precautions to avoid civilian casualties entirely.”
Three days after the report was released in the Human Rights Council, NATO's chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen denied its anodyne conclusions regarding NATO. And then, for added effect, Rasmussen said that they were pleased with the report's finding that NATO “had conducted a highly precise campaign with a demonstrable determination to avoid civilian casualties.” There is no such clear finding. The report is far more circumspect, worrying about the lack of information to make any clear statement about NATO's bombing runs. NATO had conducted its own inquiry, but did not turn over its report or raw data to the UN Commission.
On March 12, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon went to the UN Security Council and stated that they were “deeply concerned” about human rights abuses in Libya, including the more than eight thousand prisoners held in jails with no judicial process (including Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, who should have been transferred to the Hague by NATO's logic). Few disputes this part of the report. The tension in the Security Council is over the section on NATO. On March 9, Maria Khodynskaya-Golenishcheva of the Russian Mission to the UN in Geneva noted that the UN report omitted to explore the civilian deaths caused by NATO. “In our view,” they said, “during the NATO campaign many violations of the standard of international law and human rights were committed, including the most important right, the right to life.” On March 12, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused NATO of “massive bombings” in Libya. It was in response to Lavrov's comment that Ban's spokesperson Martin Nesirky pointed out that Ban accepts “the report's overall finding that NATO did not deliberately target civilians in Libya.”
NATO is loath to permit a full investigation. It believes that it has the upper hand, with Libya showing how the UN will now use NATO as its military arm (or else how the NATO states will be able to use the UN for its exercise of power). In the Security Council, NATO's Rasmussen notes, “Brazil, China, India and Russia consciously stepped aside to allow the UN Security Council to act” and they “did not put their military might at the disposal of the coalition that emerged.” NATO has no challenger. This is why the Russians and the Chinese are unwilling to allow any UN resolution that hints at military intervention. They fear the Pandora's box opened by Resolution 1973.
Vijay Prashad's new book, Arab Spring, Libyan Winter (AK Press) will be out in late March. On March 25, they will be speaking at the plenary panel of the United National Anti-War Coalition National Conference in Stamford, CT, alongside Bill McKibben, Richard Wolff and Nada Khader on “Global Economic Meltdown, Warming and War.”
The City of Oakland, California, having solved all other problems while transforming itself into an eternal utopia [insert /sarcasm tag here], has decided to ban coal from the city. Oh, not just mining, but the sheer presence of it!
“The Oakland City Council voted Monday 7-0 to approve a coal ban ordinance, which would keep coal from being exported from the city.”
While this may seem as yet another silly local ordinance, Oakland remains a major port facility, and this ban effectively stops coal from Utah from being shipped to Asian markets.
How many of these same whiners who supported the coal ban, which literally effects international and interstate commerce, happily invoke the EPA to fine and sue people for building a pond on their own property?
Methinks that come Christmas-time, Santa Claus won't be abiding by the coal ban when it comes to the city councilors…
To make matters worse for the city, there was already a signed contract regarding the coal:
“But a spokesperson for the coal industry sees it differently. ‘The city has no legal right to go back on a signed contract, which is has with the developer and secondly to begin cherry picking commodities that it doesn't happen to like today,' Oakland Bulk and Oversized Terminal spokesperson Larry Kamer said. “The proposed bulk terminal would have been right next to the Bay Bridge toll plaza. Officials said safer commodities could be processed instead and Oakland could put a dent in climate change. “If coal is not shipped from Oakland it's not likely to be shipped from anywhere on the West Coast,” Public Health Institute spokesperson Linda Rudolph said.”
Funny how those who happily invoke the interstate (and international) commerce clause of the Constitution to give the Federal government unlimited power, somehow think that a local entity can block real international and interstate commerce on a whim.

The success of Bravely Default came as a surprise to no one, least of all RPG hungry portable gamers who are aware, unlike certain big name Japanese studios, that old style 80s JRPGs are starting to come back into vogue. While Square may still be learning that people want this type of game, their competitors, such as Atlus and NIS, are all too happy to beat them to the punch by meeting the consumer demand they have chosen to ignore. Whether it's with obscure dungeon crawlers or pantsu-sniffing RPG ecchi-fests, the retro pool is getting deeper, on both consoles and PCs.
The latest of these retro-inspired, hardcore JRPGs to make the jump to the western market is Furyu's The Legend of Legacy, an ambitious RPG that was designed by ex Level-5 and Square-Enix staffers. With such a strong pedigree, you'd expect the game to at least be somewhat pleasurable…but making a quality RPG isn't the same as building a house or baking a cake. An RPG is about balance, finesse, putting the right rewards and progression systems in and making sure it is spread out thin enough to keep the player excited to go forward, but just challenging enough to keep that carrot dangled a few inches out of reach every time they go grabbing for it.
Confusing metaphors aside, I can tell you that The Legend of Legacy is not one of these finely-tuned RPGs. As talented as Furyu may be, I think they made the same mistake with this RPG as Level-5 did with “Your HP tops off at 999” Rogue Galaxy. And “Pokémon, but with more grinding” Ni no Kuni. And…well, maybe I should just start at the beginning.
The Legend of Legacy uses a system of leveling and skill accrual that is borrowed from the classic SaGa games of old. For those who are unfamiliar with the SaGa games, their character progression mechanism was such that you didn't gain levels and instead gained parameters and abilities based on how you acted in combat.
Getting hit would increase your hit points, using magic would increase mana points, successfully attacking would increase strength and weapon use would unlock new abilities centered around the weapon you held in combat. Though somewhat inelegant, it worked well enough to become the basis for several JRPGs, including quite a few indies as well. Everything from 1998's Muira Warrior to Square-Enix's own Chrono Cross used variants of the “SaGa-style” of character progression, and it usually worked.
Usually.
Speaking as an immense fan of SaGa Frontier 1 and 2 on the PSX, I love the way that the SaGa-based progression mechanic negates the need to grind levels. Sure, I love grinding (I'm a Shin Megami Tensei fan, so that's a given) but the biggest draw of those level-less character advancement systems is that you don't have to bulk up for hours on end to get the stats needed to move forward.
As you encounter higher level enemies, the likelihood of learning advanced techniques and gaining large stat bonuses goes up, creating a nice balance between “I'm getting one-shotted” and “I'm one-shotting the enemies”. Go play Chrono Cross or Saga Frontier and blaze through them without leveling if you don't believe me. The silky-smooth and gradual ascent to those game's climaxes is almost entirely devoid of agonizing grinds.
The Legend of Legacy, however, is not.
Right from the start, you'll find the odds stacked against you and probably experience quite a few party wipe-outs. I know that I did, and it only served to anger me enough to spend all night grinding with the same three characters until I could make it to the first boss in a healthy enough state to stand a chance.
The downside to that was me having ignored all of my other party members and having to spend *that much time* with them as well, eventually grinding them up to a respectable level to where they wouldn't get one-shotted. Let's just say that Pegasus formation the game starts you with that has one of your characters tank with a shield saved my rear-end more times than I'd care to admit.
To be fair, while you do need to grind fairly heavily in the first 10 hours or so after starting the game, it does become a bit more bearable after you smack down the first shrine's boss. After that point, you no longer need to grind too much. Mainly because you start getting forced to wade through gigantic trash mobs in astonishingly repetitive and confusing dungeons.
Earlier in the review I mentioned that grinding can be fun if you spread the content thin enough to keep the experience fresh. New enemies, new environments, new spells and weapons…these all make the grinding fun. Some games elect to have rare gear drop from random mobs to aid in this mechanic, while others (like Shin Megami Tensei) drop new skills and abilities on you like F-bombs at Shea Stadium. No matter what method they use, they always keep something new right in front of you to make that grind feel worthwhile. There's a reason and an incentive to grind, and that's the trick to keeping any RPG exciting.
The reason I bring this up is because The Legend of Legacy has no such incentives.
Weapons are found extremely infrequently and are only in chests or bought for high prices in town from a merchant whose stock changes about as infrequently as American schools change their history textbooks. Skills that you unlock are mostly just higher damage variants of previous attacks, save for a few that inflict status ailments. Spells are gained through shards that require a contract you must lift off bosses and can only equip two at a time. Enemies are mostly palette-swapped cut-and-paste nuisances. Dungeons use frequently recycled assets which make them incredibly uninteresting…
Basically, every new bit of content that would make that grind feel bearable is spread *so* thin and trickled out *so* slowly and inefficiently that fighting 6-man trash mobs every 30 seconds while you bumble through very cramped corridors in copy-pasted dungeons feels about as exciting and rewarding as working the late-night shift at a burger joint. Though at least in that case, the agony would be blunted by you receiving a paycheck.
I should have expected the game to be small when the size of the download after receiving my review code was *one third* the total block size of Bravely Default. Not to compare the two games again, but it doesn't bode well when your game is less than half the size of a game that already uses a fair bit of asset recycling.
The saving grace for the game could have been its story. I say could have been since, at first glance, it looks as if The Legend of Legacy would have one. Sadly, that's not really the case. Though you can select your starting character and you can ask the King if he's dating anyone before they send you off to find artifacts for him, there isn't much more than that. The majority of the story is told through poetry given to you by ancient monuments or spoken during short intermissions. It tries to be classy and artful in the way that, say, Lost Odyssey was, but it didn't work on me. I could make no sense of it even 20 hours in and all I could do was think how banal the combat was.
That's the biggest crime too, since an unimaginative combat engine is a sure-fire way to kill a gamer's interest.
When I first played The Legend of Legacy, I was told the game had, quote, “Unforgiving combat” and that it would test my party management skills. Unfortunately, that wasn't true. The combat is incredibly straight forward with very little strategy needed beyond “Make sure you heal” and “double up on enemies with a mid-level attack to conserve resources”. Granted, as I said earlier, that first 10 hours or so will require some delicate finagling, but after that it's all about basic 1980s JRPG common sense. They do try to add a field-effect elemental system (again, similar to Chrono Cross) but you can ignore it about 90% of the time.
When you combine the bland combat with the copied and pasted dungeons, poor monster variation, lack of incentives, tortoise-like progression and almost non-existent plot, you get a game that makes me question whether the developers even bothered playing it after compiling their code.
Most of the game is spent running through dungeons looking for chests and trying to clear them so you can sell the auto-map information to the merchant for easy gold. What's sad is that it isn't very long until you begin opening up dungeons that have in upwards of a dozen or so interconnected screens that all look alike with the same enemies crowding their corridors.
What really stings is that the majority of them are just there to act as the machine that spits out *another* dungeon location. You can imagine my frustration when I waded through trash mobs for 5 hours straight (without saving, mind you) only to hit the end of a dungeon and have a scripted event fire off that merely opened another dungeon just like it elsewhere on the map.
I don't want to come down hard on The Legend of Legacy, but it seems like it follows that same Level-5 trend of being a game that will only appeal to a very small niche of gamer who expects something completely different from the genre than everyone else. If you don't mind grind-heavy slogfests with middling rewards, painfully slow progression and the kind of asset re-use and enemy palette-swapping that would rival the first four NES Dragon Quest games, you may find something to enjoy here.
For the rest of us, I would recommend getting your SaGa-style RPG fix by playing Final Fantasy Legend 2 on that old Game Boy you're hopefully keeping around.

The Bad
It was the early ‘90s and Donald Trump had a tax problem. The mogul had financed three Atlantic City casinos via $1.3 billion in debt, mostly in the form of junk bonds. Then all three fell into bankruptcy and their bondholders were forced to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars to salvage any portion of their ill-advised investment.
But the IRS would be less forgiving. Canceled debt counts as income. If Trump reported their bondholders' act of mercy, he'd be on the hook for a multi-million-dollar tax bill — one that very well could have ruined the Trump Organization right then and there. According to contemporary reports from New Jersey casino regulators, Trump spent much of the early ‘90s with a mere few million dollars in their bank accounts. Creditors scolded them for buying Marla Maples a $250,000 engagement ring. Things were not “big league.”
But Trump has always had a gift for making other people pay for their mistakes. And this time, it would be the American taxpayer: The mogul would avoid reporting hundreds of millions in taxable income by pursuing a tax-avoidance scheme so dubious, their own lawyers suggested it likely breached the bounds of legality, according to documents newly obtained by the New York Times.
Trump's maneuver was modeled on a strategy that was used by corporations until it was outlawed in 1993. Before then, companies would avoid reporting canceled debt by offering their creditors a “stock-for-debt swap.” The market value of that stock might be worthless (shares in an insolvent company aren't hot commodities). But the creditors were already prepared to lose their money. And giving away worthless stock allowed the corporations to dodge their tax bills.
But while Congress had barred companies from doing this, they hadn't explicitly banned partnerships — like those through which Trump owned their casinos — from doing the same with equity. Sure, the government had repudiated the underlying concept, a point Trump's lawyers made in tax opinion letters. But the casino magnate decided to take the gamble.
And, apparently, they won. A little over a month ago, the Times reported that Trump had claimed a $916 million loss in 1995, a sum large enough to absolve them of any income-tax liability for more than a decade. Writing off losses is a standard and defensible part off our tax code. But analysts puzzled over how Trump could have posted such an extravagant one. It now appears that Trump's $916 million loss was likely inflated by their failure to report their bondholders' hundreds of millions in canceled debt. (This can't be determined with certainty because the Republican nominee has broken with decades of precedent and refused to release their tax returns.)
After news broke of Trump's near-billion-dollar loss — and the years of tax-free living that likely followed it — the mogul tried to turn their political liability into their opponent's.
“Why didn't they ever try to change those laws so I couldn't use them?” Trump asked supporters at a campaign rally this month.
In 2004, Congress banned equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships. Among the senators who voted for the law was Hillary Clinton of New York.
NEW YORK -- An unattended backpack prompted a temporary evacuation at the World Trade Center PATH station, CBS New York reports.
Sources told CBS New York that Port Authority K-9 officers received a "positive hit" on a PATH rail car at the World Trade Center station, but the backpack that was to blame for the evacuation turned out only to contain vitamins and clothing, officials later said.
"Due to police activity, service in to and out of WTC is suspended. Please use MTA for service uptown for PATH service in to New Jersey," read a tweet posted on the PATH Alerts Twitter account.

PATH service into and out of the World Trade Center is suspended as Emergency Service and K-9 units from the Port Authority Police Department investigate the area.
PATH Alerts told customers that service along the World Trade Center line is terminating at Exchange Place in Jersey City until further notice, according to the Port Authority.

Employees were allowed back into the Oculus at the World Trade Center around 4:15 p.m. The scene was completely cleared by 5 p.m., according to CBS New York.
Video posted on Twitter apparently shows officials evacuating the public from the PATH station on Sunday evening.
HONG KONG — There are many reasons why NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden's decision to come to Hong Kong could be foolish.
Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the United States; its government is weak; its foreign policy is dictated by Beijing — no friend of free speech or internet freedom.
But there is at least one reason it could be incredibly shrewd: Hong Kong's asylum system is currently stuck in a state of limbo that could allow Snowden to exploit a loophole and buy some valuable time.
A former CIA employee working as a contractor with the US National Security Agency (NSA), Snowden leaked to the UK's Guardian newspaper stunning details of a top-secret US spying program.
Simon Young, director of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, told GlobalPost that a decision delivered by Hong Kong's High Court in March of this year required the government to create a new procedure for reviewing asylum applications.
Until the government does this, they said, asylum seekers are allowed to stay in Hong Kong indefinitely.

"We're still waiting to hear from government how they are going to implement this decision," said Young. "Until that's the case, you can't return anyone until the law's in place."
In other words, should Snowden apply for asylum, then even if the US made a valid extradition request and Hong Kong was willing to comply they could not be deported until the government figured out a new way to review asylum cases — a potentially lengthy process.
Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch says that any Snowden extradition must be "a long way off" because of this gap in the law.
"If it comes to the point where the US does issue a warrant on Snowden, and then passes it over to the Hong Kong authorities, and they decide to fight it, at this point it would be a court case," they told GlobalPost. "And it can be a long court case, going up to the court of final appeals."
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Hong Kong said that it could not disclose whether or not Snowden had begun the process of seeking asylum. In their conversations with the media, Snowden has indicated that they ultimately hope to find sanctuary in Iceland.

Apart from this temporary asylum loophole, however, Snowden's case faces many hurdles.
David Zweig, professor of Chinese politics at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, points out that if Snowden was hoping to throw themselves on the sympathy of mainland China — which has sovereignty over Hong Kong — then their timing is poor.
"For a foreign policy perspective, it's a bad choice," says Zweig, noting that Xi Jinping and Barack Obama just finished a two-day summit in California.
"If relations were [bad], China might have said, 'Let's make the Americans a little anxious.' But we just had this effort to build goodwill, and this would undermine this goodwill so fast. That's why I think they'll let them go."
On discussion boards, some Hong Kong residents debated whether Snowden might have cut a deal with mainland authorities. The website Bad Canto translated one writer who speculated in Cantonese that Snowden had "become a spy for China when they were in the US, or they may have fallen to a honey trap. What was reported was probably less than 20 percent of what had happened."
And there's another way Snowden could evade extradition.

Patricia Ho, a lawyer at Daly & Associates, which specializes in refugee cases and international public law, told GlobalPost that in December Hong Kong courts ruled the government could not send people home if they would face cruel and unusual punishment.
"The reason I think this is relevant," said Ho, "is because if you look at the case of Bradley Manning, during their detention period, they were found to have suffered cruel and degrading treatment. It was found by the UN special rapporteur on torture," they said.
"I would imagine given the similarity in the cases that Snowden could easily say, 'Well, I fear that the same would happen to me,' and use that as a basis to claim protection in Hong Kong. If they do that I would say their chances of protection would be fair."

The murder of John E. Volungis Jr. 15 years ago remains one of the city�s most provocative mysteries.
Not because no one could figure any reason that anyone would want to kill the 21-year-old man who died Feb. 3, 1992, the night before they were to leave for active duty in the U.S. Army.
No, motives were as plentiful as the blood around the body of the young man whose throat had been slit and who had been stabbed 18 times after they entered their house through the garage.
Suspects are not wanting in the case, either, as police have publicly identified two of them. What there have not been are indictments; no one has been charged.
The St. John�s High School graduate had received an associate�s degree in law enforcement, and aimed to become a state trooper on the way to their ultimate goal of being an FBI agent. But some of the contact the former altar boy at St. Joseph�s in Auburn had with law enforcement did not seem to be leading them toward a badge. While some people go to the courthouse and get married, Mr. Volungis got married and went to the courthouse: The day after their marriage, they went to the Worcester County Courthouse as a defendant.
But it ended happily for Mr. Volungis when a jury acquitted them of charges that on March 15, 1990, they had shot 25-year-old James C. Morone, the former boyfriend of their bride, Bridget D�Iorio. Mr. Volungis was 19 and Ms. D�Iorio was 30 at the time of the shooting.
When Mr. Volungis turned up dead 14 months later, there were so many other suspects, just from the previous year, that Mr. Morone, who allegedly thought of Mr. Volungis as an unacceptable romantic rival, was not even the first one considered.
Rather, when police came to the Auburn home of Mr. Volungis� parents to inform them of the homicide, the family told police they believed they had been done in by their wife, the same woman who said their former boyfriend had threatened Mr. Volungis.
The 14-month marriage had been a rocky one, with Mr. Volungis moving back into their parents� home three times, according to their mother, Linda Volungis. They said their son told them that their wife made taking out a $150,000 life insurance policy � on top of the $50,000 in military-related life insurance they would receive if they died � a condition for their return to their marital home. �He thought a contract would be put out on him,� they said.
April Volungis, two and a half years younger than their brother, said, �My brother told me that if something should happen to him, to go to the police and tell � them that their wife had them killed.�
They added, �He told me they would be safer if they signed it and just went away.�
Bridget D�Iorio declined to comment for this story. But in a civil trial in 1997, they emphatically denied knowing about their husband�s death until they found their lifeless body when they returned home about 8:30 that night � an hour after they had dropped them off there.
The family alleged that Ms. D�Iorio changed plans on the day of the murder to make sure that she, and not their sister April, drove their husband home � and also that their children would not be there.
Mr. Volungis was killed just 25 days after the insurance policy was taken out, and four days after Ms. D�Iorio had placed a call to make sure that the policy was in effect. The civil trial was to prevent Ms. D�Iorio from collecting the $150,000 in insurance proceeds by finding them an accomplice before the fact of their murder.
The jury that heard the civil suit believed the family and found against Ms. D�Iorio, who now operates a hairdressing salon on Plantation Street. Mrs. Volungis, having been denied satisfaction in the criminal system, tearfully said of the civil finding, �I�m just happy someone believed me. At this point, this is the only justice I�ve been allowed.�
A year later, however, Judge Stephen E. Neel, who had allowed the case to be presented to the jury, overturned the verdict, saying the jury could have arrived at it only by �impermissible speculation� and not on evidence introduced during the trial. The judge�s decision was all the more crushing to the family because Detective Lt. John J. McKiernan, then commander of the Worcester police homicide division, had been prevented from testifying that they had identified Ms. D�Iorio as a suspect in the case.
The family appealed the judge�s verdict, but it was upheld by the state Appeals Court. The Supreme Judicial Court declined to review the decision.
John E. Volungis Sr., father of the murder victim, said of Judge Neel�s decision, �Why do you even impanel a jury? I just find it very peculiar and suspicious.�
Ms. D�Iorio, who gave police a statement hours after the murder, has never again agreed to talk to the police about their husband�s murder.
The other suspect publicly identified by police is Matteo Trotto, who has since been sentenced to 23 years in prison for cocaine trafficking. Worcester Police Detective Robert Couture testified in an unrelated mob trial in federal court that Mr. Trotto is a possible suspect in Mr. Volungis� murder, as well as in the disappearance two years later of another city resident, Kevin Harkins.
Mr. Trotto�s lawyer at the time, Anthony M. Salerno, called that testimony �outrageous,� saying that those are old murders in which Mr. Trotto has not been charged.
Insurance money is far from the only possible motive for Mr. Volungis� murder.
During one of their separations, John Volungis and their wife attended counseling sessions, John Volungis Sr. said. The elder Volungis gave this account:
One day in September or October 1991, during a counseling session, their son thought that their wife was ready to reconcile. That night, John Volungis Jr. went back to 5 Porter St. with flowers for their wife.
When they got there, Ms. D�Iorio came to the door wearing only a sheet or a towel. A man � who John Volungis Jr. said they later learned was Patsy Santa Maria Jr. � emerged from the bedroom. The younger Volungis said they told the man they didn�t blame him, but blamed their wife.
They proceeded to trash the house.
Ms. D�Iorio called the police and Mr. Volungis was served a restraining order at their parents� house later that night, after their father had taken them to the St. Vincent Hospital emergency room to be sure they had not broken their hand by punching a wall.
That incident was several weeks before three pipe bombs exploded in the driveway of Mr. Santa Maria�s home at 25 Blue Bell Drive. Before long, two co-workers of John Volungis Jr. at UPS in Shrewsbury were charged with the bombing.
A retired agent of the U.S. Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives testified in a pretrial hearing that the suspected motive for the attack was an alleged romantic relationship between a member of the Santa Maria family and the wife of John Volungis Jr.
Patsy Santa Maria Jr. declined to comment for this story.
Penelope Kathiwala, the lawyer who represented Ms. D�Iorio in the civil suit, suggested that someone else might have had a motive to harm Mr. Volungis. On the Thursday before they were killed, they said, Mr. Volungis testified for the prosecution against a UPS employee who, Ms. D�Iorio said, was Mr. Volungis� co-worker and enemy.
Thus, investigators were awash in conceivable motives: The $150,000 life insurance policy taken out 25 days before the murder of the 21-year-old who held two part-time jobs; testimony against the enemy whom Ms. Kathiwala did not name; someone who thought Mr. Volungis was connected to a bombing; and James C. Morone, whom a jury did not believe when they identified Mr. Volungis as the person who shot them on March 15, 1990, and whose former girlfriend married Mr. Volungis.
While Lt. McKiernan said Ms. D�Iorio was a suspect, they also said early on that Mr. Morone was not a suspect.
With certainty, Mrs. Volungis said they do not believe their son was involved in the bombing at the Santa Maria house. But John Volungis Sr. said, �I�d like to believe not, but I don�t know.� Similarly, Mrs. Volungis said they believe John Jr. was innocent in the Morone shooting, while Mr. Volungis Sr. said, �I didn�t know if they were involved or not.�
They added, �But you always had a feeling that something was going on. We thought somehow they had some involvement. I honestly thought it was someone else that we had known� who shot Mr. Morone.
None of this has been easy for the Volungis family. John and Linda Volungis remember a spirited and loving, if headstrong, son. They are suspicious of the explanations of the events of the night of the murder, including reports that their daughter-in-law immediately ran to the other side of their duplex house, where their brother Guy D�Iorio lived. Although they were home, their brother said they heard neither Bridget�s knocking on the door nor anything earlier to indicate that John Volungis was being killed.
Linda Volungis said their son adored children, especially Ms. D�Iorio�s two boys. They said John intended to spend time with the boys before they went into the Army, and Bridget had said before they left the Volungis house in Auburn that day of their murder that they were going to pick up the boys on the way to the house on Porter Street in Worcester.
But Bridget denied in court that dropping off their husband alone at the house represented any change in plans.
Mrs. Volungis said, �I think about them when I first get up, and all day long.�
Every time they pass by the pictures of their grandchildren on the living room wall, they said, they think of how their son would have enjoyed their sisters� children.
And the unsolved murder of their son grew only starker with the unsolved murder of Candace Allen Scola in July 2002. Mrs. Volungis and Connie Allen, Candace�s mother, were best friends at Fanning Trade School and Mrs. Volungis had served as a bridesmaid at Connie Allen�s wedding. Their children, John Volungis and Candace Allen, were nearly the same age and had played together from infancy into their teens, Mrs. Volungis said.
Ten years and five months after John was killed, Candace was found dead in their home at 3 Knox St., stabbed repeatedly. Suspicion fell on their spouse almost immediately, but nearly five years later there is no indictment.
It�s a familiar scenario for Mrs. Volungis.
Through it all, they still hold onto hope that their son�s murder will be solved. They hold their optimism, even though they have not had much contact with the Worcester police since Lt. McKiernan patiently listened to them almost weekly until they retired four and a half years ago, they said.
Mr. Volungis isn�t so sanguine. They recount trying to interest the FBI, the Army Criminal Investigation Command, local, state and national television, and the former and current district attorneys� offices in the case.
In 1994, Mr. Volungis said, they were told that an alleged accessory after the fact to their son�s murder had offered to testify and name names, in exchange for immunity. But Assistant District Attorney Thomas Landry had told them they did not want to grant immunity because of concern about the suspect�s level of involvement in the crime, despite the family�s feelings that prosecuting someone is better than prosecuting no one.
Timothy J. Connolly, a spokesperson for District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr., would not answer questions about the Volungis case. They urged that anyone with evidence or tips call the district attorney�s office, (508) 755-8601.
Detective Lt. Robert F. Rich said the Worcester police remain in charge of the case, but declined to say if there is any new information.
�If we don�t have sufficient evidence to present to the district attorney, we�ll just keep plugging,� they said. They always have hope that the case will be solved.
If we've learned anything from the desperate fight between Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for the democratic nomination for President, it is that success is never inevitable. (Image from award-winning cartoonist, Nick Anderson, of The Houston Chronicle.)

The analysis of why Obama surged so effectively against the self-proclaimed assumptive nominee, Clinton, has been instructive in all kinds of ways relevant to Found|READERs, especially a leader's ability to communicate in a way that inspires the rank and file to action — a skill every founder ought to have. (See: The Difference btw. A Tactician and A Leader, Thought of the Day: ‘Yes you Can!'; Credentials vs. Judgment.)
Now this morning I've read what must be the most incisive and devastating postmortem on Clinton's implosion, penned by none other than liberal New York Times columnist, Frank Rich. I call it to your attention because Rich's descriptions of the Clinton Machine remind me too much of something else: the bloated, over-hyped, Kool-aid drinking, but strategically lethargic animal we know around here as the over-funded startup. Such characteristics of glutony do not guarantee success. They doom one to fail.
By comparison, writes Rich, the Obama campaign was “lean and mean”, with a focus on maximizing even the smallest increments of funding with indefatigable grass roots footwork — just like the best bootstrapped startups. For example:
The gap in hard work between the two campaigns was clear well before Feb. 5. Mrs. Clinton threw as much as $25 million at the Iowa caucuses without ever matching Mr. Obama's organizational strength. In South Carolina, where last fall they were up 20 percentage points in the polls, they relied on top-down endorsements and the patina of inevitability, while the Obama campaign built a landslide-winning organization from scratch at the grass roots. In Kansas, three paid Obama organizers had the field to themselves for three months; ultimately Obama staff members outnumbered Clinton staff members there 18 to 3.
I encourage you to read all of Rich's very thoughtful column, The Audacity of Hopelessnes.
As saddening as it is to see promising ventures fail (Clinton has so much to offer, but this clearly wasn' the right model or the right time) as always, there is much to be learned from them.
Taylor Hill via Getty Images Tim Kaine says they share “concerns and questions” with some skeptics of AT&T's Time Warner bid.
For months, Hillary Clinton's campaign has been hinting through Beltway back channels that their administration wants to challenge corporate power. Them team has been increasingly attentive to arguments that blockbuster mergers between mega-corporations hamper market competition, force consumers to pay higher prices for lousier service and enhance the political power of big firms.
But it has largely been Washington gossip. In an appearance on NBC's “Meet the Press” on Sunday, vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine gave a public airing of the Clinton campaign's views.
When asked about whether the administration would support telecom giant AT&T's bid to acquire media conglomerate Time Warner, Kaine didn't close the door on supporting the deal. But they did throw far more shade at the arrangement than political campaigns typically do.
“Some Democrats, including Al Franken, are very skeptical of the merger, including Donald Trump as well,” NBC host Chuck Todd said. “But Al Franken said, ‘I'm skeptical of huge media mergers because they can lead to higher costs, fewer choices, and even worse service for consumers.' Are you a skeptic of this merger as well?”
“I share those concerns and questions,” Kaine replied. “We've got to get to the bottom of them. [We are] generally pro-competition. And less concentration I think is generally helpful, especially in the media. But this has just been announced, and I haven't had a chance to dig into the details. But those are the kinds of questions that we need to be asking.”
Addressing news of the merger Saturday, Trump said they would block it if they win the White House in November.
“It's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” Trump said during a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The GOP presidential nominee, who has stepped up their attacks against the media in recent weeks, added that their administration would also look at breaking up the 2011 merger of Comcast and NBC Universal.
For the past three decades, both political parties have been sympathetic to increasing concentrations of corporate power. That consensus now appears to be changing. For more on the shift, read here.
UPDATE:
A Durham Ontario Canada resident, Michael Schmidt, is still under bail conditions for apparently being an accomplice to conspiracy in this sheep ordeal.
Today Schmidt is going in for fingerprinting for a charge that simply doesn't fit the ‘crime.' The Ministry of Natural Resources had set up surveillance cameras on public property without any labelling on the cameras or permission of residents, which were found in the ditches around their homes.
Schmidt's neighbours chose to take down the cameras to find out who they belonged to and why they were there. They found over 80,000 images on SD cards of citizens jogging, walking dogs, and moving through day-to-day life. They called the police to find out whose cameras they were, but were unsatisfied when police refused to disclose their ownership, instead demanding the cameras be handed over.
Schmidt refused and cited infractions against transparency, justice, and their own privacy as their main reasons for not giving up the details of the camera's whereabouts. Now, they are being charged with theft under $5k for not sitting by while government bodies intrude upon private lives without their knowledge or consent. Schmidt is a social activist like we (the Collective team) haven't seen in a long time. Their ongoing struggle with the government has been a 21 year battle and their raw milk farm has been raided over five times. They have been detained, thrown in jail, and even placed in solitary confinement, where they refused to eat on principal.
According to Schmidt, they were not in jail of their own free will and the state does not have rights over their body, so they refused to eat. They went on another hunger strike more recently when trying to get a simple dialogue going with the Premiere of Ontario about the circumstances of their farm's operations.
So, he's going in for fingerprints for one incident, but there is a possibility they may not come out because of another issue. Support Michael Schmidt, because he's basically taking the fall for all of us in a much bigger way.
Original Story:
Rare Shropshire Sheep are ordered to be killed against shepherd's consent by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency due to a falsely suspected disease
Shepherd now faces up to 12 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees
Launches fundraising project to raise money for legal fees and charges
Farmer and shepherd Montana Jones has had a rough couple of years. Since 2010, she's been fighting a downward battle with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Before all of this, they were living a simple life as a farmer and blogger in a rural part of Ontario, Canada.
“Along with other heritage breed livestock, I raise Heritage Shropshire sheep, a breed that is on the Rare Breeds Canada Endangered livestock list. The British genetics in my Wholearth flock had pedigrees dating back to the early 1900's when the first British stock was imported here,” Jones wrote in one of their blog entries.
It was clearly their passion and life's work, breeding the beautiful sheep to keep the endangered species alive and strong, with there being only a small amount of the animals alive today. Them life changed for the worst in 2010, however, when the CFIA swooped down on their little heritage farmstead and declared that an ewe that they had sold many years prior (to a livestock hauler and farmer in Alberta) had tested positive for a sheep disease called Scrapie. There had only been 10 cases in all of Canada the year before. And it is worth mentioning that the disease poses no risk to human health.
The Scrapie infected sheep did not have the traceability I.D. ear tag that was there when Jones sold it — apparently the owner “didn't have it” — but CFIA were told it was originally their sheep. The CFIA agreed it was quite possible that it had been infected in the time since it had left Jones's farm:
Scrapie is easy to spot, and my flock NEVER had a single sign or symptom. The CFIA went ahead and conducted live tests that have an 88% accuracy rate in detecting the disease. The ‘dead' test on obex brain tissue has only slightly higher accuracy. As I predicted…all tests came back negative. But that wasn't good enough. The CFIA issued an order to kill them anyway.
Jones goes on to explain how they tried their hardest to find alternatives to the dire situation:
I offered many other risk free alternatives and suggested we work together to find out if indeed any illness had ever been in the flock. “Kill first ask questions later” is not the best option to conserve a rare breed. The CFIA did not even respond to my proposal. The CFIA wouldn't listen to over 5,000 petitioners on Change.org either. The CFIA is not pleased that I made their unjust actions public knowledge. I am horrified at the degree of harm a government agency can do with an incredible amount of money and a superfluous number of relatively incompetent employees. Who was I to suggest that our government re-examine their protocols regarding agricultural biodiversity?
I was advised to roll over, let the CFIA kill my healthy sheep, take their compensation money and move on. Other commercial sheep producers did…why shouldn't I?
The situation didn't get any better for Jones. Without mercy, the CFIA ordered Jones to dig a large hole to bury their sheep:
They demanded I hire an excavator and have a deep grave dug, and said they would kill them before my eyes and leave me to bury them all. A 15-foot pit was dug at the top of my hill overlooking the farm…the hill they grazed peacefully for so many years. Then the CFIA told me they changed plans, and decided to load my sheep for a stressful 5 hour transport to a killing facility at a pet food plant near Ottawa, and that I would have to pay the bill.
There were many calls, emails and messages from outraged people saying they'd take, hide or move the sheep to protect them. The CFIA arrived early April 2 to kill the flock, but the sheep were gone, with only a note left. Months later they were discovered on a distant farm, and the CFIA killed them and their newborns. All of the the tests came back negative.
Jones admits their quality of life has been destroyed by the CFIA:
My farm is still in quarantine, CFIA has effectively halted my farm income and ensured that each day revolves around them, and defending my right to live peacefully. They have attacked, stripped bare, twisted up and torn down. It's non-sensical: am I that much of a threat? I was just quietly living and farming with a few animals, growing vegetables, selling at local farmers market…well, I was. Not now. The CFIA continued to issue press releases announcing the high risk to the nation and “dangerous” nature of the missing sheep situation. The CFIA claimed they understood what a severe impact their procedures had on “affected” producers (implying that my destroyed flock they killed had indeed been infected with “disease” they weren't) …and how difficult it must be and announced publicly that they properly compensate producers for their losses. Simply not true. Armed with search warrants, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency investigators and Ontario Provincial Police raided my home, Michael Schmidt's and two others on August 2nd, 2012. The CFIA charged myself and raw milk activist farmer Michael Schmidt and 2 others with numerous criminal offences including conspiracy, for allegedly trying to save Canada's heritage sheep and preserve our country's agricultural biodiversity. The domino effect of the CFIA's invasion meant selling off my heritage turkey breeding stock because I had no way to feed them. My beautiful pastured Tamworth pigs too, and two white Percheron mares. My farm truck died last fall. Then my car followed suit in December.
If convicted, Jones faces up to 12 years in jail and up to $1.5 million dollars in charges and fees. They have launched a GoFundMe campaign to help raise money to support them cause.
More people need to know what our government is doing with the power we have vested in them, on the pretence of protecting us. I refuse to believe that the gross misuse of power wielded by this government body might go unnoticed. First, I need to ensure the farm will not be lost. Then, to raise funds for legal defense against the CFIA's charges, and to raise awareness about how their policies are affecting all of us, and work to get them changed.
Jones says they have managed to stay strong through the support of so many people who have been following their story since the initial raid in 2010:
The encouragement of all those who have been following this story has been a huge support to me. It constantly reminds me that we are all in this together:no matter how different our personal suffering or challenges. This is not the worst thing that ever happened to anybody, but it IS happening, and it needs to stop. With your help, we'll breathe life back into this farm once again.
Montana Jones has already managed to raise $95,000 dollars with the help of so many caring souls. Help spread the awareness of Jones' story and support their GoFundMe campaign today!
Montana Jones: ‘Farmed & Dangerous'
Ryse: Son of Rome is always regarded as having one of the best facial animation in a video game. It seems like the studio who helped create this facial animation is going to work with Chris Roberts to bring “State-of-the-Art” facial animation to Star Citizen, the crowd-funded space trading and combat simulator.
This announcement was made by Cubic Motion on their official site. Star Citizen is an upcoming Space Sim from Chris Roberts, the creator of the incredibly popular Wing Commander series. Star Citizen has a smashing success in its crowd funding and has gained about $37 million so far.
The game is being developed on a modified Cry Engine 3. This new announcements mean we are going to get state-of-the-art graphics with state-of-the-art facial animation. On their website, Cubic Motion have got an amazing portfolio working with developers like Crytek, Warner Bros. Games, DICE, among others. Ryse: Son of Rome and Battlefield 4 were among their latest projects and both feature top notch facial animation.
Dogs and cats may “sleep” with more mates “than is safe or reasonable”—but unlike us, they can't unwrap a condom. Will you help us provide this essential form of birth control? Thank you for considering this.
Millions of dogs and cats must be euthanized every year because people continue to let them breed when there are not enough homes to go around. Most end up in shelters—others are left to fend for themselves on the streets, where they are often subjected to cruelty, suffer from starvation or diseases, or are hit by cars.
Two of our clinics currently display images of Simon Cowell and Ron Artest. Please see this mock-up of what the Tucker Max clinic could look like, complete with the “Fix Your Bitches!” slogan and an image of you hugging a dog.
Since 2001, our mobile clinics have helped prevent the births of hundreds of thousands of unwanted cats and dogs. In fact, PETA spays and neuters more than 800 dogs and cats every month in some of the most impoverished areas of North Carolina and lower Virginia. We assist owners who have a hard time paying their utility bills, are without transportation of any kind, and often live in trailer parks. One of our mobile clinics is on its last legs (it's in the repair shop more than it's on the road), so this would be a huge help.
I am writing on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and our more than 3 million members and supporters with a proposition we hope you'll like. Having heard about Planned Parenthood's rejection of your offer, we'd like to propose an alternative way that you can help prevent unwanted pregnancies, receive a tax break, and put your name proudly on a clinic—perhaps along with a picture of you and your dog! We would like to purchase a brand-new mobile spay-and-neuter truck and name it “Fix Your Bitches! The Tucker Max No-Cost to Low-Cost Spay and Neuter Clinic.” The truck would cost just shy of $400,000 (delivered fully equipped) and give us $100,000 in leftover funds to spend on veterinary fees—if you are willing to spend the same amount you were offering Planned Parenthood.
I will say this: I had no idea PETA had such a great sense of humor about this stuff. I am legitimately impressed with their idea and the photoshopped picture, and it makes me wish I'd have gone to PETA and discussed this as something to do for the release of my book, if for no other reason than to see what other ideas why it could've come up with. Whoever came up with this idea internally should get a raise.
I thought long and hard about whether I should do this. It really is a great idea, but there are other concerns. Like I stated in my previous post, this was never JUST about attention for my book. When I made my initial offer to PP I had three aims:
1. Reduce my 2011 tax burden
2. Get a different kind of press for the upcoming release of my new book
3. Financially support an organization who's mission I believe in
Giving $500,000 to PETA accomplishes ZERO of those goals. It's 2012; I've already dealt with my 2011 taxes. My recently released book has been out for two months now, and it did fuck great, I don't really need any more press for it (it debuted at #2 on the NY Times Best Seller List and all three of my books are STILL on the list). And perhaps the MOST important reason of all: I do not agree AT ALL with the mission of PETA.
I wanted to give money to PP because I agree with the mission of PP, and have used PP in the past. They obviously don't want my help, but whatever, that doesn't change my views on reproductive issues. In the case of PETA, I am in emphatic disagreement with them on almost everything. You see, I am a hunter. That means I kill animals (and then eat their delicious meat). You think I drink to excess and sleep with more women than is reasonable? You should see how much meat I eat! My refrigerator is pretty much all dead animal, I have leather all over most of what I own, and I fucking love it. PETA hates that, and has done all kinds of awful shit to hunters in the past. There is no chance I'm supporting an organization that wants to ban two of my favorite things: Making animals dead and then eating them.
If we're talking about what an awful organization PETA is, that's really just the beginning. They're so ridiculous, they compared the holocaust to killing chickens. Not only that, but they have a history of shitting on celebrities they've worked with in the past. And perhaps worst of all, they are the ones that think violence against women is OK. Their stated ultimate goal is complete animal liberation. They're serious about that. Fuck that–I not only disagree, I vehemently oppose that goal.
But then I thought about it a little more, and I realized to shut the door in their face because of our other disagreements would do exactly what Planned Parenthood did to me. I called PP out for being hypocrites because they are, so I refuse to do the same thing. Here's the thing: Even though PETA and I disagree on many things–eating meat, hunting, etc–PETA and I do share a common love: dogs. This is my girl Murph, pointing out that their dinner is officially one minute late:
Since everyone involved loves dogs and wants to help them, then I think we should find a way to look past our differences and work together towards that common goal.
To that effect, I am proposing another solution, one that helps dogs but doesn't force me to give money to an organization that works at odds with most of my personal beliefs:
In the past, I have supported a cause in Austin called Austin Pets Alive that is trying to open a no kill shelter (another thing I disagree with PETA on, they operate kill shelters). Their new building has numerous naming opportunities. I would love to make a sizable donation to them, and PETA should agree to match whatever I put in. If that happens, I will open it up to any of my fans to contribute as well.
If PETA doesn't like Austin Pets Alive for some reason, that's OK, they are welcome to suggest any other dog-related charity in the Austin (or surrounding Texas) area, and I am down for contributing a lot of money to help them do positive things for dogs. Together, I am sure we can raise several hundred thousand dollars for needy and worthy dogs in the central Texas area.
Ocean levels are rising around the globe, so rather than tethering our buildings to the sinking shoreline why not suit them for a life at sea? That's the approach behind the Water-Scraper, a futuristic self-sufficient floating city. A special mention in the eVolo Skyscraper Competition, the design expands the concept of a floating island into a full-fledged underwater skyscraper that harvests renewable energy and grows its own food.
Touted as a self-sufficent floating city, Sarly Adre Bin Sarkum's Water-Scraper utilizes a variety of green technologies. It generates its own electricity using wave, wind, and solar power and it produces its own food through farming, aquaculture, and hydroponic techniques. The surface of the submerged skyscraper sustains a small forest, while the lower levels contain spaces for its inhabitants to live and work. The building is kept upright using a system of ballasts aided by a set of squid-like tentacles that generate kinetic energy.
The architects “envision a future where land as a resource will be scarce; it is only natural progression that we create our own. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface is ocean, even more if climate change has its way, hence it is only natural progression that we will populate the seas someday.” As anyone who has seen Waterworld will attest, it's a grim future indeed — which is why it's essential that we do what we can to stem the course of the world's rising tides.

Castrogiovanni has played 109 times for Italy
RBS Six Nations: Scotland v Italy Venue: Murrayfield Date: Saturday, 28 February Kick-off: 14:30 GMT Coverage: Watch live on BBC One, BBC One HD, online, tablets, mobiles and BBC Sport app from 14:00 GMT; listen on BBC Radio Scotland; text commentary on BBC Sport website.
Italy's Martin Castrogiovanni is set to miss Saturday's Six Nations match against Scotland at Murrayfield after being bitten on the nose by a dog.
The 33-year-old Toulon prop needed 14 stitches in a wound inflicted while playing with a friend's dog.
The Italian rugby federation said it was a "slight domestic incident".
Italy are bottom of the Six Nations table after losing 26-3 to Ireland in Rome and 47-17 to England at Twickenham in their first two matches.
Castrogiovanni, capped 109 times, was fined and given a suspended ban in December after a media rant against Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill.
The Argentine-born player, who spent seven seasons at Leicester, was upset with them for claiming they left Welford Road in 2013 for a pay rise.
This Camacho Corojo is a very full bodied smoke, so just know that going in! There wasn't a ton of complexity with the flavors of this cigar, but the flavors that you do experience are have a great depth to them. Tons of spice on the retrohale made me need to call the firetrucks to my nasal cavity. Overall a great burn and smoking experience, I'm not sure if I'd go running back to smoke it again though.
Initial Thoughts
Some of you may have missed the rebranding launch this year that Camacho put out. Honestly, if you've missed it, I'm shocked because they have been everywhere. They've changed their branding to “Built Bold” and have included scorpions on practically everything. It's a nice change of pace from their very traditional look and feel that they had before hand. I went to an event last week at Tobacco Road Coffee & Smoke Shop it was a combination Room 101 and Camacho event.
So I went in walked around a bit to see what they had. I had been interested in the new branding from Camacho so I figured I'd give it a try. I picked up a Triple Maduro, Connecticut and the Camacho Corojo which I'm reviewing here. After talking Garret, the local rep they told me that they had tweaked all the blends just a bit, except for this Corojo blend. They said that it was a staple in their line and they didn't want to tinker with it and affect their follower's favorite smoke. They also had some very interesting things to say. If you live ever get a chance to go to one of Garret's events go, because he's a riot. This might be one of my favorite quotes ever: “There are 3 things that every red-blooded American male should do in their lifetime. Go to a Nascar race, go to a WWE event and go see Weird Al Yankovic live!” I was right there with them until the end. I was like Weird Al? Really? They said he's been to over 20 shows and they said he's one of the greatest entertainers in the world… So I don't know maybe he's on to something. Either way, they really knows their cigars and I was more than happy to sit and chat with him. So enough about Weird Al, let's dive into this cigar!
Looks
As I said above, Camacho has gone through a rebranding process. You might be able to find this Camacho Corojo in the old packaging, but chances are you won't. I honestly haven't seen any old Camacho packaging in a while. I'm not sure if they bought back all the inventory and they are re-banding or what. But it's been a long time since I've seen that weird looking C logo.
This new branding is very bold, which is exactly what they're going for. They wanted to make a statement with the new packaging, look and feel of their cigars. I'm not exactly sure why they went with a scorpion. I couldn't really find any info about that, but I have to say I like it.
The band on this Camacho Corojo is a bright red band that takes up almost 1/3 of the barrel of this robusto size. On each end it comes to a point, like it's a hexagon that has been wrapped around the cigar. In fact if it had 8 points I'd say it damn near looks like a stop sign wrapped around, but I can only count 6 points so there goes that comparison.
In the middle of the band you a very bold font face that just says Camacho and in small letters right below it, is the Corojo. Every blend has a different colored band for easy reference which I'm thankful for. Because if you expected people to read that corojo below you'd have a lot of people confused on which cigar they are picking up because it's pretty small print.
The Honduran Corojo wrapper has a very reddish hue to it. It's a great looking wrapper though, has a nice velvety look to it. Not overly smooth, but smooth enough to enjoy. Let's see how well this stick is built!
Function
I'm always a little leery of cigars at events, because most of the time the cigars have been sitting outside of the humidor for a little while and I'm not sure how quickly that would affect the construction of the cigar. Hopefully it wouldn't affect it that quickly, but you never know. So when I bought this Camacho Corojo I brought it home and left it in my humi for some TLC for a few days to make sure everything was good to go on it before my review.
When I pulled it out of the humidor I gave it a quick pinch test to make sure it was ready to go. No soft spots anywhere and the bounce back was quite nice actually. I was ready to take this stick outside and light it up.
When I took it outside I gave it a thorough look thru, the filler looked good on the foot. Nice and full of tobacco. nothing to note of worry there. It has a slight flaw on the cap placed on it's head. Nothing that I'm really concerned about though because I'm about to cut that right off!
No big veins running through the wrapper on this Camacho Corojo either which is always a good sign. So I think I'm ready to nip the cap and test the cold draw on this stick. The pre light draw is nice, not too much resistance but just a little. I was able to draw plenty of air through the barrel and get a sense of what's in store for me. So I think I'm ready to light this guy and check it out.
Smoking
Now I don't typically smoke in the day time so it's a little more difficult to toast the foot of the cigar. Partly because the flame on my Xikar Stratosphere isn't a sharp cone like flame similar to other torch lighters. So I just had to forego toasting the foot on this stick. I just began puffing on and trying to pull the flame in. It took about 5-6 puffs before the filler really took to the flame. I was kind of concerned at first and then finally it took, albeit slowly. It felt like it took 5 minutes to just get in that initial 1/8″. Usually this part burns pretty quickly for me, but this time on this Camacho Corojo it was taking longer than anticipated.
Once I got through the initial lighting issue of this stick it burned great. Very even and the draw was fantastic. It continued this way through the entire first third. The smoke output wasn't as a great as I thought it would be. There wasn't much wind so much of the smoke stayed around me and I was surprised there wasn't more created honestly.
The second and final third were more of the same, very even consistent burn. The draw was consistent as well. I noticed on the final third I was starting to actually hear the wrapper burn when I draw air through the barrel. It was very interesting I had not heard that in a while and I was entertained by it. Alright let's get into those flavors that everyone talks about with this Camacho Corojo!
TORONTO — Wearing dark shades and a black hoodie pulled up over their Toronto Blue Jays baseball cap, Andrew Wiggins looked like they were attempting to slip through Pearson Airport incognito.
They were anything but.
The 20-year-old from Vaughan, Ont., landed in Toronto on Saturday afternoon to some 10 cameras and a couple dozen journalists, there to capture the arrival home of Canada's NBA rookie of the year.
Fellow travellers stopped and stared. Airport staff hollered congratulations.
Life has definitely changed since the six-foot-eight forward left for Minnesota 10 months ago. What do they make of all the attention?
"I'm always comfortable, I'm never uncomfortable doing anything, if I wasn't comfortable doing it, I wouldn't do it," said Wiggins, who's been a much-hyped prospect since they were in high school. "It's just something I have to go through."
Do they enjoy it?
"At times," they said. "At times I just want to go home. You get used to it, I've been doing this from a young age."
Wiggins was home to host a party for the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight — "I got a little sumpin-sumpin I'm doing," they said, with a wide smile, a pair of gold-plated headphones dangling from one hand. They were heading back to Minnesota on Sunday.
Their brief trip to Toronto came two days after they became both the first Canadian and Minnesota Timberwolves player to win rookie of the year, with a campaign that saw them put to rest any concerns about their competitive spirit en route to averaging 16.9 points and 4.6 rebounds and playing in all 82 games.
"It means a lot," Wiggins said on the award. "I had a lot of goals coming to this point, to make the NBA, be the first pick, then after the first pick I wanted to be rookie of the year, so it was a list of things I wanted to achieve. And this is just the beginning."
Wiggins hopes to can inspire other Canadian kids.
"Yeah, just always motivation and hope, and hope I can be a positive role model for them to just want to get to the point I'm at right now," they said.
Wiggins spoke to reporters for four-and-a-half minutes Saturday before climbing into a black SUV to head into the city.
They remained mum on their plans for this summer, saying only that he's in conversations with the Timberwolves. With Minnesota missing the playoffs — the T'Wolves finished a league-worst 16-66 — they turned their attention to the Toronto Raptors, watching their brief NBA playoff run against the Washington Wizards.
"I did, I was rooting for them," they said.
Wiggins talked about how veteran forward Kevin Garnett took them under their wing.
"He was a big part… and I feel like everyone's growth on the team," Wiggins said. "His presence was just felt on and off the court, even the games where they aren't playing and they were on the bench, you still felt their presence on the court. Their intensity just rubs off on you.
"(Garnett's) lesson was probably just: you've got to find your pace in the game, never rush anything, it's not a sprint it's a marathon."
Wiggins received 110 of 130 first-place rookie of the year votes and had 604 points. Chicago's Nikola Mirotic finished second with 14 first-place votes and 335 points and Philadelphia's Nerlens Noel was third.
The long-rumored follow-up to the star-studded Poker Night at the Inventory is no longer rumored, as Telltale Games picks the worst possible day to officially unveil Poker Night 2. It's the sort of timing one would expect with GLaDOS dealing the cards.
It's a whole new night and a bold new cast replacing the original game's Tycho, Max, Heavy and Strong Bad. The first half of Sam and Max tags in for their bunny-thing buddy. Claptrap takes time off from Borderlands. Brock Samson, my wife's imaginary boyfriend from Adult Swim's The Venture Bros. is battle-ready, and a distinctively non-Bruce Campbell Ash is guaranteed to lose at least one hand.
Get it? Because...hand. Hee.
Poker Night 2 is coming to PC, Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network later this month, with other platforms coming in the future. For more information, it's a website.
Are Externalities an Intellectually Sound Bridge Between Us and Them? By Bryan Caplan
When Princeton's Roland Benabou visited GMU a couple weeks ago, they made an argument I've occasionally heard before: Non-economists would disagree with economists less, and respect our views more, if we put more emphasis on the concept of externalities. When economists talk about markets, the argument goes, we usually seem tone deaf to non-economists' concerns. If we put more emphasis on the concept of externalities, non-economists could see that it is easy to translate their concerns into our language – and that we have every reason to take their concerns seriously.
As a rhetorical strategy, Benabou's probably right. Non-economists are much more anti-market than economists. If we told them that the economic way of thinking is consistent with (or better yet, justifies!) their anti-market prejudices, we'd be more popular.
But is this an intellectually sound way to bridge the divide between economists and non-economists? I think not. If we explain the concept of externalities properly, non-economists will continue to give us the cold shoulder. Here's why.
1. The concept of externalities relies entirely on economists' standard notion of willingness to pay. If people are willing to pay to preserve a rare species of monkey, there may be an externality. If no one cares, there's no externality. The upshot is that the concept continues to slight non-economists' concerns about fairness, intrinsic value, equality, etc.
2. If an externality exists, the economically efficient solution is normally a tax or subsidy. That's it. But non-economists are usually looking for an excuse for government to ban or nationalize. At minimum, non-economists want to use hands-on regulation – not just add a tax and say “OK, problem solved.”
Someone who uses an externalities argument to justify e.g. existing (or stricter!) EPA regulation doesn't really understand the argument.
3. The concept of externalities focuses on non-excludable costs and benefits. The upshot is that we can go down the list of e.g. environmentalist causes and pick out a major subset that probably don't qualify as externalities problems. Recycling? If people are paid the market value of what they recycle, it's hard to see the externality. National parks? If user fees can't sustain them, you have to fall back on a lame “existence value externality” story.
4. Most fundamentally, externalities can afflict any social institution – markets, governments, non-profits, etc. So there's nothing inherently anti-market about the concept. You can use externalities arguments to complain about auto emissions. But you can just as easily use the concept to complain about voter irrationality. If the externalities of government decision-making are severe enough, externalities provide an efficiency argument for living with market failure rather than doing something about it.
Bottom line: If economists are upfront about all of this – and we should be – the concept of externalities is not going to make us many friends. Economics has a lot of unpalatable lessons to teach. Our job is to teach them nonetheless.

Delhi has become a dangerous city to live in because of rampant unauthorised construction, the high court here said on Friday and felt the need to unify the three municipal bodies as the trifurcation of MCD had "not improved" the situation.
Pulling up the three municipal corporations of Delhi, a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said the court was flooded with PILs against illegal and unauthorised constructions which showed no regulation was being followed by the civic bodies.
The court also said that "under the shield" of the National Capital Territory of Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Act, amended from time to time, "completely illegal and rampant unauthorised constructions were going on".
"Delhi is such a dangerous city now because of unauthorised constructions," the reports said. Source PTI
The Act, which was last amended by the Lok Sabha in December 2014, protected from punitive action all unauthorised constructions up to June 1, 2014.
Prior to the amendment, unauthorised constructions only up to February 8, 2007 were protected.
It observed that the MCD trifurcation had not improved the situation and there was a need to unify the trifurcated MCDs, while hearing a PIL alleging unauthorised construction was going on in some properties in Mehrauli in south Delhi.
MCD issues notice for evacuation of 38 'dangerous' buildings. Source PTI
Advocate Kushal Kumar, appearing for South Delhi Municipal Corporation , said that in the instant case the persons who were allegedly engaged in unauthorised construction had obtained sanction from it by applying online.
The bench, however, said that just because the application was made online, the corporation's responsibility to carry out an inspection "does not get obviated".

It should be easy to visit my incarcerated client.
After all, she's locked up. They can't miss a subway on their way to seeing me and definitely won't have a childcare emergency or conflicting appointment.
I know where they are: "Rosie's," the women's jail on New York City's Rikers Island. And I know where I can go to meet her: not Rosie's.
Visiting anyone "on island," as we call it, requires leaving your office for an entire day. That could mean neglecting the rest of your caseload. So most attorneys I know ask to have their Rikers clients brought to Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street in Lower Manhattan.
There, I'm confident this client and I can discuss strategies for their pending family court case. The stakes are arguably even higher than in the criminal case they face—after all, we're talking about how to get their child back when she's released from jail. As a court-appointed attorney, I'm asking a client who didn't get to choose me to trust that I will fight for their child—and them I have to stand up in court and say that I am talking for that person.
If I'm going to speak for her, I need to visit face to face. But visiting can be a hell of a slog.
Check out this look at the daily reality of life in solitary in an American jail.
First, I have to call the New York City Department of Correction a day in advance. There are multiple numbers, and although the department publishes some of them, they're usually handed from attorney to attorney like passwords to a speakeasy.
Sometimes, no one answers. I call one number and let it ring on speaker, while I'm putting case notes into my computer. I lose track of the number of rings. I hang up and call the second number. This time I count. Twenty. Forty. I dig in my heels this time. I will not hang up.
On the 45th ring, a muffled voice answers.
"I'm calling for an attorney-client visit," I say. "My client is at Rosie's." I rattle off my client's book and case number.
"No go, counselor. It's after 3 PM."
It's 4:05 PM on Monday afternoon, and I've been in family court all day. I want to see my client on Tuesday afternoon. Isn't this a day in advance?
"I'm calling from California? It's before 3 o'clock here," I gamely try.
"You have to call before 3 PM the day before you want to see your client, counselor. Not two days, not the day of. The day before. By three."
I had sent a letter to my client, informing them that I'd be requesting a visit for tomorrow at Centre Street, and now I'm sick imagining them thinking I forgot or didn't bother. There's no way to reach them by phone; they don't have commissary money to call to me, and a letter sent today won't wend its way to them in time. She's just across town, but that doesn't matter when the line between inside and outside goes through so many gates.
The next week, I get it right. When court is in recess (before 3 PM), I call that number and refuse to hang up. I finally get a correction officer on the line and give my client's case number. They will be produced at 100 Centre Street sometime the following morning, although I'm not told when.
The next day I send an email to my colleagues in court: "Going to corrections. See you at Christmas." I'm going dark.
I arrive at 100 Centre Street at 1 PM, during my first break in all-day family court hearings and slap my secure pass against the filthy glass window. I heave open the heavy metal door and shove my pass under a second window to the same officer. They push it back; the gate in front of me buzzes.
I shoulder that gate open and am faced with a wall of dented lockers and, past them, a metal detector. I go through it, giving up my pass to another CO behind a desk. They take it, giving me a weary hello—we've been through this many times together—and hands me a laminated badge identifying me as "No. 8" to clip to my blouse.
Going through those gates is like entering an airlock. Inside, there is no natural light, no sound of the rain or wind—not even the strong smell of New York City.
"It's raining out there," I offer to the CO behind the desk, thinking that maybe she'll appreciate a weather report.
"I don't give a shit," they say. "It's not raining in here. Sign in."
In this digital age, there still exists a ledger at Manhattan Criminal Court with smeared pages and a ballpoint pen attached by a chain. It's the size of a phone book, of a dictionary, of a Bible.
I sign my name, write the purpose of my visit and my client's case number. There's a column for the floor I'll be visiting.
"What floor is my client on?" I ask the officer.
"Don't know," they answer. "Maybe seven. Maybe 12."
I write seven.
I pick a locker and lock up my briefcase, phone, keys, umbrella.
I pass through another gate.
The elevator clangs open. Another CO is operating it. He's a clever guy with a dark sense of jail humor.
"Where to, counselor?" they ask.
"Hawaii, please."
"And if we're not having a luau today?"
"Seven. Or 12, please."
"Male or female?"
"I'm female," I respond. "So is my client."
"Let's try 12," they say.
Another gate. A long hallway. Another ledger.
The visiting area is a large rectangular room with a smaller cage inside it. Attorneys sit inside the cage and incarcerated people sit outside the cage on stools. It's noisy. I can hear raised voices, impatient explanations, frustration, anger, and resignation piling up like laundry. There is no privacy here; everyone can hear everyone.
I have to wait because women can't be produced alongside men. One full side of stools has to be empty before my client can be brought out.
Fifteen minutes go by. Thirty minutes. Lawyers leave, looking annoyed and rushed. Clients leave, looking dispirited and broken.
A CO asks for the name of my client again, then uses a phone to call some unseen place behind yet another gate.
"Your female just left," they say, hanging up the phone. "Must have left while you were waiting. They took the early bus back to Rosie's."
I stare at him.
"They do that, you know," they continue. "They wake them up so early, like 4 a.m., to get on the bus. No one tells them why they're here. By 2 PM, they're given an option to leave, so most do. Why stick around? They're tired. They're hungry."
I keep staring.
It should be easy, visiting my incarcerated client.
Rebecca Boucher is an attorney in New York City. They represent parents who are responding to petitions filed against them in Family Court.
Conservatives in Congress are mounting what will likely be a futile fight to defund Planned Parenthood, even if it means shutting down the entire federal government.
Just those first 12 words amount to the journalistic equivalent of “It was a dark and stormy night...” This is a path the Republican Party's right flank has been down several times before since 2011, and they've never succeeded in achieving the policy outcome for which they began their fight in the first place. In 2013, conservatives forced a government shutdown over the funding of Obamacare. It lasted two-and-a-half weeks, but when the doors reopened, the healthcare law was untouched.
Earlier this year, conservatives again held up federal funding, this time for the Homeland Security Department, as part of a battle to block President Obama's executive actions on immigration. Ultimately, Republicans caved, DHS stayed open, and the president's policy went forward—until it was blocked by the courts in a move completely unrelated to the maneuverings in Congress.
The strategy is a total loser. It has never worked, and yet it is one that conservatives continue to embrace as a means of battling a pair of bogeymen that their supporters revile with just about equal fervor: the Obama administration and the GOP leadership.
How is that possible?
In the view of conservatives, Republican leaders have never actually waged the full fight to the bitter end. Even when they brought the nation to the brink of default in 2011. Even when they shut down the government two years later. And even when they nearly let homeland-security funding lapse earlier this year. The party leadership always blinked, eventually. Nevermind that Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell folded each time only after Republicans had incurred substantial political damage, and only after the White House and congressional Democrats had made clear they would move no further. According to this thinking, if GOP leaders had held out a little longer, a conservative victory would have been at hand.
“They don't want a fight at all, and that's part of the problem,” Representative Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina conservative, told me when I put this question to them last week. “The base has been waiting now for four years for a fight, and our leadership has never given it to them. We tried a little bit on Obamacare. We tried a little bit on immigration. But at the end we ultimately never stood up for what the base of the party wants. That's why this is so critical.”
Elected in 2010, Mulvaney has become one of the conservatives most frustrated with the party leadership. But he's also among the most transparent. One of the reasons Boehner and McConnell have never wanted a shutdown fight is because they know that it's almost impossible for Republicans to emerge with a political victory. Republicans can protest as loudly as they want that it is Democrats causing the crisis by refusing to compromise—Why does President Obama prioritize funding for Planned Parenthood over money for our troops? is one talking you can expect to hear repeatedly. But the general public is always going to be quicker to blame a government shutdown on the party that constantly rails about wanting to rein in the government. The sharp drop in standing that Republicans suffered during the 2013 shutdown bore this out, and it was only the equally damaging rollout of Obamacare that allowed them to recover so quickly ahead of the 2014 elections.
Mulvaney didn't dispute the conventional wisdom that Republicans would lose the spin game of a shutdown over Planned Parenthood. But their argument in favor of trying anyway was revealing. The conservative base put Republicans in charge of Congress, and it is the constituency to which the leadership needs to be accountable. And what about the rest of the country? That's the wrong audience, Mulvaney suggested. “My leadership is trying to appeal to independent and swing voters who don't care what we do right now and won't until two or three months before the election,” they told me. The base is paying attention now, in other words. Everyone else will forget about it come election time.
This is, of course, a remarkably cynical view of the current state of American democracy and the ever-shortening attention span of the electorate. But it is instructive as a way to view the latest confrontation on Capitol Hill. It also explains why Boehner has spent much of their speakership banging their head against the wall, and why Beltway insiders awoke Tuesday to read yet another story suggesting their future is in doubt. Mulvaney is not alone in their thinking. He's secured the written commitment of 28 of their Republican colleagues to oppose any spending bill that does not defund Planned Parenthood—just about enough to force Boehner to rely on Democratic votes to keep the government open.
As I wrote last week, Mulvaney and their allies are trying to use the threat of a coup against Boehner as a way to force them to wage the Planned Parenthood fight. That might not work for a variety of reasons, one of which is that Democrats could bail out Boehner to keep them as speaker. Conservatives like Erick Erickson believe that even if they did, Boehner would be so wounded that their reelection as speaker in 2017 would be impossible. Yet just as Republicans would have over a year to recover politically from any shutdown fallout, so too would Boehner, who has done it before.
The battle that conservatives are mounting isn't about Planned Parenthood, and it's not even really about Boehner, or McConnell for that matter. As Mulvaney told me, the lesson they are taking from the surprising staying power of Donald Trump—that “conservative” who has supported tax hikes, abortion rights, and Democrats in the past—is that the Republican base just wants someone who will fight, anyone and everyone. The September 30 deadline for funding the government is an opportunity to fight, and the fight is what it's all about.
When tragedy hits, we ask why. It is visceral, perhaps even instinctual, and almost involuntary. For the past 48 hours I have mostly sat quiet in my house, mostly alone, listening to people process an unthinkable event, a moment of real evil. How did this happen? How could this happen? Thankfully one of my friends just said it outright, “How can there be a loving God in a world like this.” We want to understand, we want to explain, at least in hopes that we can make this happen less often. We dwell on the moment, on the suffering, and ask ourselves, “How can this make any sense.” But this violence does not make sense. It never will, nor should it. There will never be a thought pondered or a sentence uttered that could ever make any one of us pause and say, “well, yes, now I get it.” This is simply evil. There is no sense inside it at all.
I woke this morning painfully aware that everyone who is going off to Church today is going to light the odd pink candle in their advent wreaths and celebrate gaudete Sunday, or more poignantly stated, Joy Sunday. It feels like a set up. This whole thing seems staged, doesn't it? And just in the mere poetry of the whole thing it makes the day feel like it wants to be ironic, a cruel punchline, a bit of sarcasm from a most awful god. But this is not irony. It is a confrontation. It is a vocation, a call to change. This day in Advent says God has nothing to do with that violence, at least not yet, and it is time for that to change.
“Joy.” Ugh. Honestly, I still cringe at the word when it is used some times. A lot of my experience with the use of the word is associated with outright dishonesty, just fake happiness for the sake of looking like a good Christian. Right? Because all Christians should always be joyful. And if you are not joyful then, well, try harder. But true joy is not pollyannish optimism. Joy is not the infinite ability to find a silver lining. “If we just keep looking we can find some good in this.” Please, no.
Please do not go looking too hard to find the good in the violence itself. It is not there.
Todays readings in Church make it clear that God's kingdom is the opposite of that. God's kingdom is a place without predators. The kingdom Jesus brings is one in which the lame walk, the blind see and prisoners go free. It is not one where God hides in the rubble of tragedies expecting us to smile big and trust that evil has some inherent meaning or cryptic message. There is no inherent “meaning” in acts of evil. There is no joy to be found in violence.
Our efforts to find meaning, sense or joy are often so passive. We want there to be something redemptive already at work, balancing the scales of good and evil as if balance is a good thing. But the lessons of Advent remind us that the kingdom of God is not here…yet. Not everything is how God wants it to be, this is not what we were created for. We all had a hand in getting us here, and we all can have a hand in setting things right.
The kingdom of God is not some mysterious spaceship that will land as soon as we seem to get all laws rightly legislated. No the kingdom of God is something which has to be built. And where is God in all of this? God is here asking us to build it. It is our job to take chaos and turn it into something sensible. It is our job to give meaning where there is none. That is to say, the story is still being written and this episode has no meaning yet. But the story is still being written. What we choose to do next with our lives, how we choose to live in a world of this particular brand of darkness will determine if there is any real meaning to any of this.
Joy does not keep its chin up, it keeps its eyes forward, its feet planted, and its arms open. Joy is not a thing I keep bottled up in my soul like some kind of nuclear powered heart as if I were a spiritual kind of Iron Man superhero. Joy is something given, shared, traded, found, forged and made. Joy is something that comes like grace, but something we have to work to make room for.
It may not be time for us to feel joy right now, but it is time for us to pave the way for it for others, for it is the nature of God's kingdom. A kingdom in which these awful things cease to happen.
The lives that were lost can only be mourned. Nothing will ever make up for these losses. But it is up to us whether we honor those lives by constantly re-membering them. Who knows what good things God was bringing to the world through them? Only God did. But what we do know is that we can still bring good things. Everyday children die unnecessarily and tragically, and we can stop this. It can be stopped. Sometimes changing a world is much much easier than we think.
What would you have done to stop this from happening? What will you do now?
So pick a name. Pick any one of their names, just one. Remember that name and then today help that child, that teacher, that hero echo through your life. Go put some more light somewhere on their behalf so that they can keep on giving to others in this world through you. Echo their best gifts, their intentions, their vocations, by continuing to do the good in the world they might have done. For God was in those things. And God can become those things in our lives today.
It is not ironic that today is joy Sunday. It is a confrontation. It is a vocation, a call to change. This day in Advent says God has had nothing to do with that violence, at least not yet, and it is time for that to change. The joy is simply that God is not done with us yet.
Choose a name and do some good.

Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's campaign CEO Steve Bannon in 2012 blasted Mitt Romney's sons for not serving in the military.
ADVERTISEMENT
The remarks, reported by Buzzfeed on Tuesday, came during an interview with Conservative Forum Radio in October 2012.
Bannon, who was then head of the right-wing Breitbart News, called the 2012 GOP presidential nominee out for not addressing the war in Afghanistan during their acceptance speech.
“Mitt Romney goes to the Republican convention, gives their acceptance speech, people give them a standing ovation, and they don't have the common decency to say one thing about our troops fighting in Afghanistan?” Bannon said.
“This is a guy who avoided military duty in Vietnam; who has five sons who look like movie stars who have not served their country one day. Oh, but by the way all of them did their two years of Mormon missionary work — every one of them.”
During the Vietnam War, Romney received three academic draft deferments and one for their service for the Mormon Church.
Trump received four deferments for college and one for bone spurs in their heels.
Third-party candidate Evan McMullin tweeted a link to the story, calling Trump out for aligning "his brand with bigotry" and calling it the "sign of a weak and insecure man."
Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi on Friday declined an offer by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Executive Committee Chairman Najam Sethi to give them a farewell upon their retirement from international cricket.
The seasoned all-rounder took to Twitter to thank Sethi for meeting them last Sunday and offering to arrange a "fitting farewell" for him.
Afridi, however, declined to accept the farewell offer citing their 'commitments' and said their earlier desire for a farewell was just to "set a new trend".
They said they were "very happy" that Test skipper Misbah-ul-Haq and master batsman Younis Khan — the veteran duo who announced retirement from international cricket this year — are being given proper farewells.
"I hope this trend will continue in the future," the former skipper said.
Afridi had asked PCB in September last year to give them a farewell match so that they could exit the international arena in a befitting manner. “A farewell match is my right,” they had said.
Sethi and Afridi met in Dubai last week to discuss ideas to give a befitting farewell to the outgoing cricketer as well as plans about their future contributions to the sport in the country.
The legendary all-rounder announced their retirement from international cricket in February this year, ending an illustrious ─ and sometimes controversial ─ 21-year career.
The 36-year-old star had already quit Tests in 2010 and ODI cricket after the 2015 World Cup but still skippered the Pakistan Twenty20 team at the 2016 world championships in India.
They stepped down as captain after the tournament although they retained slender hopes of continuing their career in the sport's shortest format as a player.
Afridi said they will now focus on playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) for the next two years.
"I am playing for my fans and will continue to play this league for another two years but it is goodbye from international cricket," they had said when the second season of PSL was underway.
"Now my foundation [the Shahid Afridi Foundation] is important for me. I have played with seriousness and in a professional way for my country."
Those with celiac disease often follow strict gluten-free diets, because consuming the protein found in wheat, rye, and barley can cause them to develop health problems and gastrointestinal issues. And yet, certain people seeking to lose weight have hopped on the gluten-free train as well, assuming that it will help them consume fewer calories and lead healthier lives. But now, a new study cautions that cutting out gluten unless you have to may actually be a bad idea for your health.
Published in the BMJ on Tuesday, a new study found that restricting gluten can have harmful health effects on people who don't suffer from celiac disease. That's because, according to researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, going gluten-free means a person reduces their intake of whole grains, which are known to have cardiovascular health benefits. So, cutting out gluten unless medically necessary can potentially increase a person's risk of heart problems.
“As such, the researchers say the promotion of gluten-free diets among people without celiac disease should not be encouraged,” the study authors wrote.
For the study, scientists analyzed data from 64,714 women and 45,303 men working in the health industry, each of whom had no history of coronary heart disease. The participants filled out a detailed food questionnaire in 1986, and updated it every four years through 2010. The researchers saw no “significant” association between gluten intake and heart-disease risk, but they did note that people who restricted gluten in their diets also “significantly limit their intake of whole grains, which may actually be associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes.”
Despite the fact that the findings merely add fuel to the mounting evidence that cutting out gluten unless you have to is a bad idea, going gluten-free as a weight-loss solution is still quite popular, the scientists note. As such, a September paper in JAMA Internal Medicine found that more people have been going gluten-free, despite a lack of medical need to do so. As of 2014, the number of people in the U.S. following a gluten-free diet tripled, while celiac-disease rates remained relatively stable.
The study authors noted that the study was observational, so further research is needed before anyone draws firm conclusions about gluten's relationship with heart disease.
With football season over, we asked the most important athlete of our age to try to make sense of the mystical experience that was Tebowmania. They said yes, on one condition: that we not alter a single word of their piece. For better or worse, we agreed.
As Yogi Berra famously said, “it's like Deja Vu came all over itself again.”
The more I read about Tim Tebow, the more I see similarities to my own life story. Our story begins with a young mother- to-be who wants an abortion. Instead, they man up and has the baby, giving birth to a son-child.
This special son-child makes a life out of bucking the odds. Though neither the strongest nor the fastest, they excel at sports. Many experts doubt the remarkable lad. They tell them they throw funny, and that they don't have the right physique for the game. It's science, they say. He'll only go so far.
But the Gifted Young Athlete refuses to let the doubters shit in their Wheaties. To hell with science. The Gifted Young Athlete knows that they have something stronger. They have God on their side. So they press on and keeps a good attitude, and every time they beat the odds in life they prove the experts wrong.
Next thing you know, there are folks calling it a miracle. Maybe the Gifted Young Athlete is blessed by the Almighty, they say. Perhaps they really does have a fucking angel on their shoulder.
And suddenly the experts don't look like experts anymore. By now, our hero has upset a whole lot of people. There are those who simply don't like the idea of a man being favored by God. They feel their special relationship with Jesus diminishes their own somehow. If Jesus loves the Gifted Young Athlete, what do they think of the rest of us? Bunch of assholes?
So the haters multiply, and soon the resentment reaches a boiling point. And that's when the torches and pitchforks and long knives come out. Yes, the world is given a savior but they choose to crucify them instead. Who'd a thunk it? The same old fuckin' story.
Maybe that's why Jesus likes us so much to begin with. They see a little of themselves in there.
You see, Gifted Young Athlete, people look at us and they see all they don't have. It's like, “homeboy's over there gettin' ‘er done! And Jesus loves them too! Fuck that guy.”
But can you really blame them? Wouldn't you be pissed? Jesus helps us win at sports games, yet he's nowhere to be found when poor people need important medicine for their kid's infection, or when they're late on a mortgage payment. Think about it. There are folks in Africa who get AIDS without even being gay. Yet here Jesus is, helping me & Tebow out in sports, just because we're maybe a little bit cooler in their eyes. It's a raw deal, plain and simple. Even though he's hooking me up, I still see it's kind of a cocksucker move on Jesus's part.
But my advice to you, Mr. Tebow, from one Gifted Young Athlete to another: don't kill yourself trying to make sense of all the madness. Just hold on to your dick and have a good time. Believe me, it's all you can do. Make no apologies, either. Those are for weak people, and the haters will hate you anyway. It's not our fault we're awesome, playboy. It's Jesus's. As the gorgeous bitches in the makeup commercials used to say, “Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.”
God Bless.

Eastbound & Down returns to HBO on February 19.
This week is a Magic Online extravaganza where we talk about all the wonderful data replays provide us with. In this case my friend and stats guy Rolle provided me with a ton of useful data for both Standard and Theros Draft. Today we'll be breaking down that data and seeing where the online metagame differs
Standard
Total Games› 43385
Looking at only decks with at least 3% of the field or more we get the following breakdown:
Tier 1: (53-56% win rate)
Esper, Mono-U, GR
Tier 2: (51-53% win rate)
Azorius, Mono-R, Boros
Tier 3: (Sub 50%)
Everything else, notables being: Mono-G, MBC, BWR Mythics, WBG (Junk)
How the Meta is Changing
Disclaimers: Because of how the data is collected, there's a limit to how much actual deck separation can be done. As a result, I couldn't tell you what the exact percentages are from GR Devotion vs. GR Aggro. It does tell us that at least one of the archetypes is doing significantly well and the other isn't doing badly enough to notably lower the win percentage. If we cross-reference this with cashing Daily Events lists, we also see that GR devotion decks largely outnumber the aggro lists about 5 to 1.
The same goes for the massive field of mono-black and mono-blue. Yes, some pet decks are scooped into the pile, but the vast majority are all the archetypes you'd expect. Mono-black control and mono-blue devotion.
These stats are also not the end-all be-all for deck selection purposes. They give a lot of insight into what to play for the majority of Magic players, including those who are good but consistently stick with worse options. This not able to take into account a theoretical best deck that perhaps would be the best choice for a given metagame with an extremely competent pilot behind them. I doubt Reid Duke would want to take advice from just this data.
For most of us, it provides a useful pool of information collected from a number of games no team, let alone individual, could battle through in a reasonable amount of time. It also showcases the evolution of the online metagame through a very tumultuous time.
Takeaways
1) Mono-Black Control Isn't That Good
Mono-black control just hasn't been all that impressive online in the majority's hands. Notably, a handful of the grinders who play on known accounts still have solid win percentages, like BBD and Todd Anderson, but most MBC players are coming up short. With that kind of metagame penetration, mirrors have to be taken into account, but even then it shouldn't have a sub-50% win percentage. When mono-red consistently had over 20% meta output it remained in the 51-52% win range.
What could be the possible explanations for this massive popularity and low-win results?
A. The Magic Online metagame simply is less favorable than the real life one for MBC
You can see this in how much red is online and how quickly the metagame skews toward newer popular decks. Why does this matter? Because MBC suffers when pilots are uncomfortable with a given match. The deck is very much a 1-for-1 machine hoping to get ahead when it doesn't have [card]Pack Rat[/card] to overwhelm the opponent. Not understanding what threats are correct to spend removal on is a major detriment.
B. The online metagame is quicker to adapt and adjust to a new “top deck” compared to real life
Part of this is likely attached to how fluid cards are online. Eating a 5-10% money loss to change decks or potentially even gaining money when swapping popular decks for less popular ones is a lot easier than real life. When decks online do well, people often either switch over to them for a bit to try them out or switch to a counterplay deck. In this case, mono-red, after the Waves deck pushed many red players out of the metagame.
Now the meta is flooded with a very good match for red decks and we see a quick resurgence.
C. The deck was cheap
Anything that costs less than 150 to build out of the gate will get people to immediately jump on board. Of course, building it now is 229, but that's beside the point. It was cheap when the initial rush of people came in to build the thing.
2) Jace and Revelation Decks Aren't Going Anywhere
Every other week people lament the death of control or talk about how this is the week slow control decks will get pushed out for good. It just isn't happening and won't for the foreseeable future. Maybe the next sets will make the metagame too hostile, but for now both Esper and UW remain solid choices. Esper may be seen as the better of the two choices, but keep in mind that if an aggro resurgence comes to bear, UW is the place to be.
Notably, UW gets very little chatter and is largely dismissed as a worse Esper deck, but if red comes back big then I'd expect the win percentages to be exchanged for the two decks. It's important to keep in mind moving forward why and when Esper is the superior control deck.
3) Red Decks are Underrepresented in Real Life
Both small red and Boros flavors are succeeding online in a field full of other very publicized and respected decks. Yet, they get very little attention, let alone major play. The mono-red link to the cost of the deck and availability of Daily Events (a.k.a.: It's a grinder deck) is well-known. However, I don't think people should completely write these two decks off because of that.
I think both decks suffer from a lack of organized advances and attention from skilled players in the real-life metagame. How many players are well known for Islands, Jund, and a host of other masteries? How many of them pick up red decks on a consistent basis? Owen showed off that RDW is a deck that can succeed even when the metagame aims at the deck.
Of course, the answer can largely be traced back to [card]Master of Waves[/card] and the deck that blew up immediately following the Pro Tour. Once again, though, we have to ask ourselves how many people will be playing the deck at a given tournament versus all of the other good matches in that same tournament? Oh, and whether RDW is just dead to Waves without exploring any others avenues—like, say, adding another color to the deck.
4) The Best Decks Online are Either Devotion-Based, Good at Controlling Devotion, or Small Aggro
You'll notice a distinct lack of midrange decks, and the devotion decks not going way over the top seem to be doing worse than the two that do. Decks focusing on 1-for-1s without clear end goals (midrange decks) falter. It wouldn't surprise me to learn that MBC's adoption of four Pack Rats, other than being impressive in the mirror, is a direct response to other decks simply forcing it to take a more active role in matches.
Small aggro doing well is interesting, some can be blamed on Esper not doing enough early outside of tripping over its own mana and praying for [card]Supreme Verdict[/card] on turn four every game. I think a lot of it has to do with how small aggro and Waves attacks the opponents, both put out a swarm with limited protection/reach. Both aspects of small aggro can potentially kill the opponent and opponents often need to successfully answer both to win. These small decks also have the option to go bigger post-board or simply tweak which mode they want to lean on, significantly changing how matches play out.
Now we move onto Limited.
Limited
Total Games 56950
Card Win % Spreadsheet
Card Win % Only C/UC Spreadsheet
Improved Expected Win % Spreadsheet
You'll get the most out of the card data by sorting by Win % or Likely Win % and by common/uncommons to compare peers against peers.
Note that the “Likely Win %” takes into account the percentage of time you'll be able to cast your spell. It's percentages are based on the average likelihood that you will reach the CMC in number of lands across all the replay games of Theros. Note this tends to have a much more accurate turnout when it comes to commons and reverses the bias for high CC cards. While I may not agree with all the potential conclusions drawn from this data in regards to certain high-end bombs, I think it does a great job of filtering out the common expression of high-end bombs being dominant and puts the commons into real view.
One of the major takeaways from the data, no matter how you process it, is that high-end bombs tend to win a lot of the time. However, they also end up played far less often than what people expect. Based purely on my own discussions with players, I find many people take for granted that they'll hit six manas by turn seven. Cards like [card]Sea God's Revenge[/card] and [card]Abhorrent Overlord[/card] are often lauded without any real consideration given for how often they sit dead in your hand. It's not that all high-end cards are bad, they need a substantial game-changing impact or they likely aren't worth putting in your deck.
Rolle added this alongside the data:
“THS is “average” speed. Going back to overvaluing expensive cards, I don't think people fully understand what this means though.
You reach 7 manas in 41% of games. 6 manas in 66% of games. 5 manas in 85% of games.
How many 6 or 7 mana cards can you really afford to play that don't just win you the game? It also means you are likely only hitting monstrosity in about half your games, unless you are ramping, and I believe this is reflected in the archetype win%.
The advantage of a huge data set is consistency. It takes away personal anecdote and the result is for Theros—the best strategy over time is just focused on reading the draft and trying to get in open colors, then drafting a proper curve, and this means more 2-drops than anything else if possible, then 3-drops, 4-drops etc. unlike M14 which barely needed a curve at all.
Synergy in the form devotion, ramping or even heroic should not overrule “solid” cards. It's not that synergy can't work, its just never going to be as consistent in a format that is average speed or faster.”
I feel like curve considerations are something that get put on the back burner by too many otherwise reasonable Limited players. Just because a format isn't blazingly fast doesn't give you a pass to ignore curves, especially in a format where the best draft decks are built around them. Looking at the best performing archetypes, the common theme is that being able to pressure early and interact early with aggression are two of the most important aspects of the format.
Green is a great example of a deep color with a strong mid- and end game and crucially few early interactive cards. This makes it an excellent companion for blue because blue has those early interactive cards with [card]Voyage's End[/card] and cheap evasive creatures to race or block other evasion.
Red is a support color as talked about last week and is slightly under drafted online.
Black is likely over drafted because the mono-black devotion deck is likely one of the best decks in the format when it comes together. However odds are good it's like trying to draft a successful Storm deck in Cube. Very satisfying when it happens, and very hard to put together consistently.
On card win percentages: First, replay data can never fully take the place of actually playing the game out. They aren't the final say on how good or bad a card is, even if we tweak the data against potential bias. Second, the gap between the highest echelon of Limited Magic players and theory may be far larger than we imagine. I hope to explore this down the road, but what it may come down to is simply a fundamental difference in how certain players approach and play Limited compared to the majority.
What's interesting is that on the whole this may not actually matter to you. Unless you consistently are playing against players on that level, odds are the data points help. Knowing what people consistently draft and do well with in 8-4s may serve as a guidepost.
Finally, having this data is interesting because it lets us make more useful distinctions than just calling a card good. It was really hard to talk about a pair of cards valued equally, because you quickly run out of arguments one way or the other. At that point, it came down to whatever the preference was. Now you can look at the big board and see if the two cards are really that equal after all. It also gives us an interesting look into major discrepancies in card evaluations. For example, on Frank Karsten's excellent breakdown last week, Tom Martell posted about their undying love for [card]Favored Hoplite[/card] and was roundly mocked.
[card]Favored Hoplite[/card] – 55.7% win rate, putting it as the 6th best common/uncommon in white, likely closer to 3rd/4th once we take data bias into account ([card]Hopeful Eidolon[/card] costing 1, but bestow for 4 amusingly dodges the Expected Win Rate solution). Even if we assume it is in 6th, it's a cornerstone in heroic strategies and we know that it's performed at a reasonable level among MTGO players.
Anyway, the data kind of speaks for itself in this case. I'll let Rolle sum it up the format as a whole:
“It's a pretty well-balanced format. WR heroic really is the strongest archetype. The reason it beats UW heroic looks like the fact that red is slightly under drafted, you are contending with UB and UG for the strong U cards. That said UG and WU are strong. WG, WB, and UB are all solid. GR and UR are a little behind.
GR I think is behind because the ramp plan plays a bit like combo in draft. You often don't have the redundancy you need to have consistent ramp into fatty that you do in Constructed. Plus, the GR uncommon is pretty sucky by comparison. The UR uncommon is also very bad.
I think this counts for a lot, in formats like this a lot can ride on the strength of your uncommons.
The mono-color decks are behind, B and R do the best obviously since they reward devotion the most. But people easily forget the mono-color decks where they've had to play sub-par cards then lost R1 and remember vividly when they had those absolutely crushing draws that devotion enables (which may have still lost in R2 when they just get outclassed by someone with higher average quality).”
My own anecdotes have largely been in line with the data, with the exception that I thought WU was the best deck in the format outright. Perhaps that's incorrect, but honestly the good WU decks feel like I'm playing Block Constructed, while the bad ones are just average WU Skies decks in Limited. It also amuses me how good WB is, even though the mana is just so painful and black devotion synergizes so badly.
Whew, that's a lot to take in. Have fun looking at this rare insight into thousands of games of Magic and see if you pick up a thing or two.

It is never easy to be a woman in a male-dominated industry, particularly one that is also dangerous and isolated, like trucking. Over at the Roadmaster's Driving School Blog, Ellen Voie is raising awareness for Women in Trucking (WIT), an organization formed in 2007 by women drivers seeking to support and aid one another.
As minorities in the industry, women still face more safety concerns and logistics issues than male truckers. Women in Trucking provides self-defense presentations, secures association discounts with partners, and lobbies for loading docks and truck stops to provide more women-friendly amenities like bathrooms and personal hygiene products. Most importantly, WIT confronts the ingrained sexist attitudes that seek to deter women from entering the industry at all.
To celebrate women in leadership roles, WIT also holds an annual “Influential Women in Trucking” event, sponsored by Navistar, and an annual “Salute to Women Behind the Wheel” event each March. They also feature guest bloggers monthly to share the personal stories of drivers across the country.
Currently, 16% of WIT's membership is comprised of men who want to show their support for female drivers, so whether you're a man or a woman, consider joining Women in Trucking to demonstrate your commitment to leveling the playing field and welcoming new drivers with professional courtesy and respect.

We don't need patronizing party propaganda in our bills. We don't need a smoke-and-mirror refinancing plan.
Ontarians need a solution to Wynne's energy mistake.

PoliZette WikiLeaks: Harwood Says ‘Burning Time' to Cover Hillary Email Scandal CNBC anchor calls race for Clinton, brags about tormenting Republicans in GOP debate
CNBC's John Harwood thinks journalists are wasting their time chasing Hillary Clinton with questions about their private email server.
In fact, Harwood is so in the tank for Hillary Clinton, they called the race for them on Sept. 27, 2015, in an email to John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairperson.
Amazing that some people still think it's worth burning so much interview time with person most likely to be next president on their emails.

“Amazing,” Harwood wrote in the subject line of an afternoon email to Podesta, continuing in the email text, “that some people still think it's worth burning so much interview time with person most likely to be next president on their emails.”
Purring to Podesta, Harwood called the election 13.5 months before anyone voted. And before the GOP and the Democrats had even settled on presidential nominees.
Most surprisingly, they dismissed the work of their fellow journalists on Clinton's email scandal, which exposed classified information to their private server and to people without government security clearance. The story itself was broken by The New York Times in March 2015. Harwood is a New York Times contributor.

Clinton avoided indictment when President Obama's FBI director passed on recommending criminal charges on July 5.

The email was discovered by WikiLeaks, and released to the public on Wednesday. WikiLeaks claims to have obtained about 50,000 emails from Podesta's Gmail account, and has been leaking a few thousand every day since Oct. 7. The leaks are expected to continue until Election Day.
For many on the conservative and Republican side, Harwood's pessimism about the Republicans and their sycophantic emails to Podesta prove what they have been thinking since they moderated the second GOP presidential debate last year.
At the Oct. 28, 2015, debate moderated by CNBC journalists, Harwood kicked off the debate with a question later ridiculed by Republicans and even a host at a sister NBC unit, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough of “Morning Joe.” Harwood asked Donald Trump if they were running a “comic book” version of a campaign.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz finally let the CNBC moderators have it.
“You know, let me say something at the outset. The questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don't trust the media,” Cruz said to applause.

Harwood later boasted they tormented the Republicans at the debate in another email to Podesta. In an earlier email to Podesta unearthed by WikiLeaks, Hardwood said: “I imagine … that Obama feels some (sad) vindication at this demonstration of their years-long point about the opposition party veering off the rails. I certainly am feeling that way with respect to how I questioned Trump at our debate.”
Getting close to the Clinton campaign may have been Harwood's objective. In another email released on Wednesday, Harwood got a stern email from Podesta on May 29, 2015 — for writing a Clinton event was short on substance.
“Won't waste your time again,” Podesta said.
To which Harwood immediately responded, like a rebuked puppy: “if you are not joking and actually have a problem with that little piece, pls call me.”
Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the right-leaning Media Research Center, said Harwood will respond to the latest WikiLeaks emails as proof of closeness to the Clinton campaign that they are buttering up sources.

“But it also matches what journalists say publicly: that the email scandal is a dreadful waste of time,” said Graham. “Their disdain for the story comes through. These emails clearly show John Harwood should have never been allowed to moderate a Republican debate. They were already bored more than a year ago.”
Our Blogger of the Week, The Only Blonde in Osaka, gives the lowdown on toilet etiquette in the Land of the Rising Sun
One of the most common questions Japanese people would ask me was 'what was your biggest culture shock when you first came to Japan?' The answer was always 'toilets'.
It's not a particularly sophisticated response, but I think most foreigners in Japan would agree. Everyone has a 'Japan toilet story'. And for the uninitiated, using a Japanese toilet may well end up being one of the most memorable/traumatising experiences of your time in Japan.
I will tell you why.
1. The seat heating
Let's assume your first time is on a conventional Japanese 'throne' as opposed to the notorious squat toilets (more on them to come). You approach the shiny white beast, trou-down, and sit. You let out an incredulous yelp, as your cheeks experience a sudden – but not unpleasant – glow of warmth radiating from the seat.
In your own country, the temperature of a toilet seat is usually proportional to the amount of time the previous user has spent sitting on it, the knowledge of which is highly undesirable. In Japan, this same sensation is recreated artificially – but it may become a guilty pleasure. Forget walking on sunshine, you are sitting on it! And doesn't it feel good.
2. The slipper-y situation
In Japanese households, the commonly known etiquette is to remove your shoes before entering the house, and put on a pair of slippers. But did you know that there are also a pair of slippers especially for use in the toilet? This is so you don't contaminate the rest of the house with your nasty toilet-foot-germs.
Unfortunately, after experiencing the joy that is the heated toilet seat, you are likely to be in a state of euphoria that causes you to forget your footwear. Many foreigners have had to perform the shuffle of shame back to the bog after being caught out wearing the toilet slippers somewhere other than the toilet. Don't let that be you.
3. The spray buttons
When using a Japanese toilet, one will likely come across an intimidating array of buttons, each of which has a different purpose depending on the gender and sanitary needs of the user. The most common buttons are marked 'oshiri' and 'bidet', for a bum and front-bum shower respectively. More advanced models allow you to adjust the heat, angle, and strength of the spray.
These buttons can be problematic for the curious foreigner who dares to test them. Many don't seem to realise that you do actually need to be seated for it to work properly. For some reason it comes as a shock when, upon pressing the button, a jet of toilet water shoots out and blasts the hapless victim in the face.
4. The Sound Princess
On the wall beside some Japanese toilets are ominous, Big Brother type speakers. These are the aptly named otohime or 'Sound Princess', a machine designed to drown out the embarrassing tinkling tones of female urination.
I remember when this was introduced to me. I was a guest at an English Speaking Club meeting, held at the teacher's house. I mentioned my bewilderment at Japanese toilets, and they decided I should be bestowed with the honour of a demonstration of their brand new 'Sound Princess'. The whole class followed us into the bathroom. The teacher pressed a button, and a loud 'GURRRRRRRRRR' reverberated around the room.
I laughed. My hostess looked at me with cool disapproval, and said, 'Maybe in your country you do not care, but we Japanese women like to go to the toilet in secret.'
Because a roaring Sound Princess is so discreet.
5. The squat
Nothing incites fear in a foreigner's heart more than entering a train station or old building and finding that the only toileting facilities available are traditional squat toilets. First of all, it seems you need the thighs of a rugby player and the balance of a gymnast to even think about attempting this.
Then there is the issue of what to do with your clothes: for the novice squatter, there is nothing more precarious than a pair of tights tangled around your ankles while in this position. I heard a story about a girl who was so baffled by the squat toilet that they thought it would be best to just take all their clothes off for safekeeping while they did their business. By all accounts it was going well, until they dropped one of their socks in.
6. The flush
You've navigated your way through the wonderful world of seat heaters, slippers, Sound Princesses, spray buttons and squats. Just when you thought it was all over, the Japanese toilet deals you another low blow – by hiding the flush in the least conspicuous place possible.
If there is one valuable piece of advice I can offer, if it is that you should ensure you can locate the toilet's flush before you proceed to do anything else. This small act could save you from potentially mortifying situations. To share another story from a source who prefers to remain anonymous, one time this person had to use a disabled toilet, as it was the only one available. Unfortunately, after finishing up they realised they couldn't distinguish the 'call assistance' button from the flush. This user decided it wasn't worth risking it, and all they could do was put down the lid and run out of there, leaving their 'problem' for the next person to solve.
7. The future
Recently reports of new smartphone-controlled toilets have been circulating the internet. The toilets, which are supposedly available in Japan this month, can be connected to Android phones via bluetooth. The user downloads an app that allows all the functions of the toilet to be operated with a touch of the phone. The toilets also have inbuilt speakers, so you can ditch the 'Sound Princess' and play your own sweet beats. The app even contains a 'toilet diary' to record all of your bowel movements!
When it comes to your Japanese toilet experience, as the saying goes, you can't polish a turd – but in Japan you probably can roll it in glitter. If you know which button to push.

Sonata Dusk is shown to be somewhat air-headed and carefree, similar to Pinkie Pie.
For example, before the Dazzlings sing battle
in the cafeteria, Sonata is more focused on getting lunch since it is Taco Tuesday. Also, they and Pinkie are the only ones who actually seem to enjoy Snips and Snails
' rap performance. Sonata doesn't pick up on Adagio's sarcasm when they say they "loves" the Human world
, and they speak candidly with Sunset Shimmer
about them and their friends' true nature, nearly blowing their cover. In addition, they frequently argue with Aria Blaze
over trivial matters. Despite this, they can be just as cruel and devious as their bandmates, if at times unintentionally so, as evidenced in their interactions with Sunset Shimmer and Trixie

This week marks the 40th anniversary of the Manson Family's murder of pregnant actor Sharon Tate, and their friends, at their California home. After serving 39 years in prison, two women convicted for the murder are seeking parole this month.
The clip above is from the 1973 documentary Manson, which featured interviews with some of the female family members, as well as footage shot by the family, in which they explain Charles' philosophy and the Family's way of life. (Squeaky Fromme, seen in the clip, had no involvement in the Tate/LaBianca murders, but was convicted of attempted assassination of the president, for which they served 34 years. They will be released on August 16.  They are still believed to be a follower of Manson's.)

Susan Atkins
THEN: Atkins, aka "Sadie," was a 21-year-old mother of a 10-month-old baby the night they stabbed pregnant Sharon Tate to death, saying, "She asked me to spare them I told them I didn't have any mercy for her," and that Sharon's whining got on their nerves. (Atkins' son, Zezozose Zadfrack Glutz, has since been adopted and renamed.) Also involved in the LaBianca and Hinman murders, Sadie was sentenced to death in 1971, (which was automatically commuted to life in prison after a 1972 California Supreme Court case that outlawed the use of capital punishment). Them cellmate said of her,"Sadie was so far out, even the bull dykes wouldn't mess with her." In 1974, they removed themselves from the Family and became a born-again Christian. In 1977 they published their autobiography, Child of Satan, Child of God.

NOW: Atkins, now 61, has been married twice while in prison. They have been denied parole 17 times. In 2002, they filed a lawsuit with the federal court claiming they were a "political prisoner" due to the parole denials despite their suitability. Atkins is currently dying of cancer—and reportedly can only turn their head from side to side, and move one arm—and their husband has asked that they be released and allowed to die at home, arguing that it would save the state $10,000 a day in health care. Them next parole hearing is scheduled for September 2.
Leslie Van Houten

THEN: The onetime homecoming queen joined up with the Family shortly after graduating from high school in 1967. At 19, they were the youngest defendant in the Tate/LaBianca murders. Having only been involved in the LaBianca murders (she stabbed Rosemary LaBianca 16 times), they said they wished they had been there the night of the Tate murders. Van Houten would giggle during testimony, thus lost the sympathy of the jurors. They were convicted of murder and sentenced to death, later commuted to life in prison. Three years after their imprisonment they fell away from Manson and the Family. They won a retrial in 1977 on the grounds of ineffective representation by counsel. While out on bail in 1978 they attended the Oscars with a friend, and wasn't recognized. They were later convicted again and sentenced to life in prison.
NOW: Van Houten, who will turn 60 this month, is in the California Institution for Women, where she's spent the past 39 years. While there, she's become a model prisoner. She's taught other illiterate inmates to read, stitched a portion of the AIDS quilt, made bedding for the homeless, and recorded books on tape for the blind, all while holding down various jobs as a clerk for different members of the prison staff. Of their remorse over the murders they say, "It's not easy. If anything, the older I get, the harder it is. I took away all that life." Filmmaker John Waters began what turned into a close friendship with Van Houten in 1985 when they attempted to interview for their Rolling Stone. Van Houten—whom Waters described "looked then, and still does, very much like actor Hilary Swank"—has been denied parole 18 times. During one parole hearing, a judge told her, "You've dug yourself quite a hole and it's going to take a little time to get out of it." Waters asks, "Can you ever dig your way out of that hole by trying to explain LSD to a parole board whose members have never taken a trip?"  They are eligible for parole again this year.

Patricia Krenwinkel
THEN: Krenwinkel was 20 when they joined up with Manson. Two years later, they participated in both the Tate and LaBianca murders (specifically, stabbed Abagail Folger to death) and is the one who notoriously wrote in blood on the walls of the LaBianca home, "DEATH TO PIGS" and "HeaLter SkeLTter." They were sentenced to death, later commuted to life in prison.
Advertisement
NOW: Like Van Houten, Krenwinkel is active with prison programs. She's in AA and NA, and has also taught illiterate prisoners how to read, gives dance lessons, and participates in a service-dog training program. They have been denied parole 11 times.
Mary Brunner
Advertisement
THEN: Charles Manson's third wife, and mother of their child Michael Valentine Manson (aka "Pooh Bear"). They were arrested and jailed for credit card fraud the night of the Tate murders. They were later charged (with two other family members) for the July 1969 murder of Gary Hinman. They received immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against Atkins and Beausoleil. (She later repudiated their statements.) In 1971, Brunner—along with several other Family members—was arrested and convicted for taking part in the robbery of a gun store and subsequent shootout with the cops. They served six years in the California Institution for Women, where Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel were serving their time.
NOW: After their release from prison, they disassociated themselves from the Family, regained custody of their son, changed their name and now lives in anonymity somewhere in the Midwest.
Linda Kasabian
Advertisement
THEN: Kasabian had the only valid driver's license of all the Family members, so they were ordered to drive the group to the Tate residence, and the LaBianca residence. (It's bizarre that they cared about traffic laws.) They later turned state's evidence against the Family, and testified at their trials.
NOW: They have refused an media interviews in the past, aside from one for A Current Affair in 1989, but on September 7, as a way to mark the 40th anniversary of the Tate/LaBianca murders, the History channel will air a special on the Family, featuring a new, and extensive interview with Kasabian.

Donald Trump accuses Comey of 'cowardly' leaks as Republicans call for President to come clean
Updated
Donald Trump has accused former FBI director James Comey of "very cowardly" leaks, as Republican members of congress called on the US President to "clear up the matter once and for all".
Key points: Republicans call on Mr Trump to confirm whether they have tapes of any conversations
Mr Trump said they would "soon" but may face a subpoena if they do not but
Attorney-General Jeff Sessions is due to appear at a senate hearing on Tuesday
Taking to Twitter, Mr Trump questioned whether Mr Comey's leaking of information to a journalist was illegal.
"I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'" they wrote.
In their testimony to Congress last Thursday, Mr Comey laid bare on Capitol Hill months of distrust of the President, asserting that Mr Trump had fired them to interfere with the probe of Russia's ties to the Trump campaign.
Mr Comey also revealed that they had orchestrated the public release of information about their private conversations with the President in an effort to further the investigation.
Meanwhile, fellow Republicans have pressed Mr Trump to come clean about whether they have tapes of private conversations with Mr Comey and provide them to Congress if they do, or possibly face a subpoena.
It was a sign of escalating fallout from Mr Comey's testimony which drew an angry response from the President on Friday.
"I don't understand why the President just doesn't clear this matter up once and for all," said Republican senator Susan Collins, referring to the existence of any recordings.
Senator Collins, who is also a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating Mr Trump's links to Russia, described Mr Comey's testimony as "candid" and "thorough" and said they would support a subpoena if needed.
"[Mr Trump] should voluntarily turn them over," they added.
But Mr Trump's aides have dodged questions about whether conversations relevant to the Russia investigation have been recorded, and so has the President.
Pressed on the issue Friday, Mr Trump said: "I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future."
Sessions to testify on Tuesday
Over the weekend, it was revealed that US Attorney-General Jeff Sessions has agreed to appear for sharp questioning by senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday — whether that hearing will be public or closed is not yet known.
Senators have expressed hope that Mr Sessions' testimony on Tuesday will help flesh out the truth of Mr Comey's allegations, including Mr Sessions' presence at the White House in February when Mr Trump asked to speak to Mr Comey alone.
Mr Comey alleges that Mr Trump then privately asked them to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn's contacts with Russia.
Mr Comey also has said Mr Sessions did not respond when they complained they did not "want to get time alone with the President again".
The US Justice Department has denied that, saying Mr Sessions stressed to Mr Comey the need to be careful about following appropriate policies.
"We want to be able to get their side of it," Republican senator James Lankford said.

Imtiyaz Shah Thumbay, who works for Kannada daily Vartha Bharathi, reported on a police raid conducted in the house of SDPI activist Kalandar Shafi.
A 24-year-old journalist working for a Kannada daily was arrested on September 7 by the Dakshina Kannada police for allegedly falsifying a newspaper report about police excess and desecration of the Quran during a raid.
Imtiyaz Shah Thumbay covers news for in Dakshina Kannada's Bantwal taluk for Kannada daily Vartha Bharathi. They reported on September 3 about a police raid conducted in the house of SDPI activist Kalandar Shafi. Shafi was accused in the murder of RSS cadre Sharath Madivala.
Sharath's murder had led to communal clashes in the district. Imtiyaz had mentioned in their report that Kalandar Shafi's family had alleged that during the raid, the police had desecrated the Quran.
The newspaper had carried photographs of the alleged desecrated holy text, which the family had shared as evidence with the reporter.
On September 7, the Dakshina Kannada police registered a suo motu case against Imtiyaz Thumbay and booked them for provocation with intent to cause riots and promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes.
On Friday, the Judicial First Class Magistrate in Bantwal taluk rejected Imtiyaz's bail application and remanded them to 15-day judicial custody.
The charge sheet also mentions the chief of Vartha Bharati as a co-accused. However, the police have not arrested anyone apart from Imtiyaz Thumbay.
Imtiyaz's bail application will be heard on Monday evening by the Mangaluru Magistrate Court, Dakshina Kannada SP Sudheer Kumar Reddy told TNM.
What was in Imtiyaz Thumbay's news report?
Imtiyaz Thumbay's news report published on September 3 was about a midnight raid conducted by the Dakshina Kannada Police in the home of Kalandar Shafi.
Kalandar Shafi is a cadre with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI).  They are also one of the accused in the murder of RSS functionary Sharath Madivala, who was brutally stabbed on July 4 and succumbed to their injuries on July 9.
In their report, Imtiyaz wrote that the police conducted a raid on Kalandar's house on September 2.
According to the report, Imtiyaz spoke to Kalandar's wife and father-in-law, who accused the police of being disrespectful to the Quran during the raid.
Kalandar's family members also handed over two photographs to Imtiyaz as evidence of the alleged desecrated Quran.
On September 3, Dakshina Kannada SP Sudheer Kumar Reddy issued a statement and claimed that the newspaper report had been falsified.
“A search team was sent to Kalandar Shafi's house in Bantwal. The police had a warrant for the search and it was given to a family member before the operation began. During the raid, when one of the officers found a copy of the Quran, they handed it over to one of the family members. Later, when the police left, the Quran was placed among a few of the family's belongings and photographed in order to create communal tension and hatred between the two communities. This picture went viral and Vartha Bharathi published it,” SP Sudheer Reddy said.
Sudheer Kumar said that the police have collected evidence to prove Imtiyaz's involvement in a conspiracy to create trouble.
“He (Imtiyaz Thumbay) has been accused of writing a false report and also circulating the photograph of the alleged desecration, which was staged. There was no police excess,” the SP claimed.
However, speaking to the media, Shafi's wife, Sauda said that the police was lying.
“The police entered our house and ransacked the place. We could not recognise the inside of our house once they were done. One of the officers threw the Quran on the floor. The raid started at 7am and went on till 11am. We are Muslims. We will never disrespect our holy text. We are not criminals but we were treated that way,” Sauda told the media.
Editor-in-Chief of Vartha Bharathi, Abdussalam Puthige, refutes the police's claim that the report was meant to create communal tension.
“Imtiyaz Thumbay joined Vartha Bharathi in 2012 and was on the desk. They were sent to report in Bantwal in 2016 and has written several stories about police excess and their inability to maintain law and order. The police is just trying to smother the voice of those writing about their incompetence,” Puthige said.
The Editor-in-Chief demanded an independent probe into the case alleging that a police investigation would be biased.
The Dakshina Kannada Working Journalists' Union, Karnataka Journalists' Union and the Working Journalists' Union of Bantwal, on Monday, condemned Imtiyaz's arrest and submitted memorandums to the police officials to drop all charges against the accused in the case.
Looking at the facade of the former Kenmore Hall Hotel, at 145 East 23rd Street, you can imagine the kind of place it was when it opened in 1929.
Like so many of the new hotels built in the Jazz Age city, it was a place for the city's young smart set, with a roof garden, skylit lobby, and swimming pool.
It was also a hotel with a hidden literary rep. Shortly after the 22-story building opened, struggling young writer Nathanael West became its night manager.
In the 1930s, West earned fame for their novels Miss Lonelyhearts (inspired by a real Brooklyn Eagle advice column to the lovelorn) and Day of the Locust.
During their time on the Kenmore's graveyard shift, West reportedly worked on Miss Lonelyhearts while letting writer friends like Dashiell Hammett, Edmund Wilson, and Maxwell Bodenheim crash in empty rooms.
West died in 1940 in a California car accident with their wife, Eileen McKenney (of My Sister Eileen fame). In subsequent decades, Kenmore Hall changed hands; as East 23rd Street became seedier, so did the hotel.
By the early 1990s it was an infamous SRO hotel where the city's downtrodden lived in squalid quarters and drugs and crime were rampant.
Since 1999 the cleaned-up Kenmore is an SRO offering affordable housing—plus a little-known literary pedigree.

With its decentralised structure, community moderation, and hands-off management, it's hard to generalise about the social network Reddit. The site is built of thousands of ‘subreddits' - user-created forums with a focus on specific topics such as the video game Destiny, fitness, a love of maps, or even just drugs.
But each subreddit has different norms, rules and tone, which can make navigating the site an exercise in frustration and nasty surprises. It takes a while to develop a feeling for any particular sub, by which point a hostile community may already have ruined your day.
Ben Bell, a data scientist at text-analytics start up Idibon, decided to apply their company's technology to the site to work out which subreddits have communities you would want to be a part of, and which you would be best avoiding.
Bell's interest was sparked by a post asking Redditors to suggest their nominees for the most “toxic communities” on the site. Suggestions included the parenting subreddit – full of “sanctimommies” – and the community for the game League of Legends, which has “made professional players quit the game”.
They write: “As I sifted through the thread, my data geek sensibilities tingled as I wondered: ‘Why must we rely upon opinion for such a question? Shouldn't there be an objective way to measure toxicity?'
“With this in mind, I set out to scientifically measure toxicity and supportiveness in Reddit comments and communities. I then compared Reddit's own evaluation of its subreddits to see where they were right, where they were wrong, and what they may have missed. While this post is specific to Reddit, our methodology here could be applied to offer an objective score of community health for any data set featuring user comments.”
Reddit: can anyone clean up the mess behind 'the front page of the internet'? Read more
Bell pulled out a sample of comments from every one of the top 250 subreddits, as well as any forum mentioned in the toxicity thread, and subjected them to a number of tests designed to look for toxicity, which they defined as a combination of ad hominem attacks and overt bigotry.
From there, they used a combination of sentiment analysis and human annotation to code each comment as toxic or non-toxic. The former involves applying Idibon's technology to attempt to categorise comments as either positive, negative or neutral in sentiment, which let them narrow down the work required for the human annotators by 96%, only looking at those subreddits which had already been picked as containing a lot of negative comments.
Sentiment analysis is a controversial technology. It allows researchers to automatically process reams of data but it is criticised as an overly simplistic tool. In Bell's tests, however, it proved its worth. “Using the sentiment model, we selected for human annotation the 30 most positive, the 30 most negative posts, and another 40 random posts from each subreddit,” they said.
“Each post was labeled as ‘supportive', ‘toxic', or ‘neutral'. We found that for comments that were randomly chosen, the vast majority were labeled ‘neutral', which didn't really provide much information for comparison, while the ones that were chosen by our sentiment model were far more likely to be labeled with the predicted sentiment than any other label.
“There are often problems with sentiment analysis and accuracy, but probably a bigger issue is that it's not always all that actionable.”
“Bigoted comments received overwhelming approval”
Bell's chart of ‘bigotry by subreddit'.
The initial finding was that, as expected, there's a huge variation in the scale of bigotry on Reddit. Bell weighed the presence of bigoted comments by the approval they had been given by the other members of the community – the comment's score, which is the net of upvotes minus downvotes. That led to some interesting quirks: in a number of subreddits, the community is proactive enough at self-policing that the average score for a bigoted comment is negative. Those include /r/Jokes and /r/Libertarian, both fairly self-evident.
At the other end of the spectrum are those communities which seem to deliberately encourage bigotry. Top of the list is /r/TheRedPill, “a subreddit dedicated to proud male chauvinism”, as Bell puts it, “where bigoted comments received overwhelming approval from the community at large”.
When it comes to toxicity as a whole, there is some crossover with mere bigotry. The /r/TumblrinAction forum, devoted to mocking users of the Tumblr social network (which is particularly associated with its queer and female userbase), is ranked by Bell as both bigoted and toxic.
Other usual suspects, such as the Atheism, Politics and News subreddits, are all ranked as fairly toxic. The problems with /r/Atheism led to that particular forum being removed from Reddit's list of default subs.
But there are also some surprises.
ShitRedditSays, a subreddit which focuses on highlighting bad content around the rest of Reddit (frequently from a social justice viewpoint), comes close to the top. In part, that is because the toxicity is directed outwards, “at the Reddit community at large”, says Bell.
“It's also important to note that a significant portion of their Toxicity score came from conversations between SRS members and other Redditors who come specifically to disagree and pick fights with the community - a trap that many members tend to fall into, and which led to some rather nasty and highly unproductive conversations.”
‘Tough problem'
But naming the problem, and identifying the subforums that have community issues is a number of steps away from making Reddit a friendlier place for all.
“It's a really tough problem,” Bell says. “There needs to come a unified understanding of what really is toxic within these communities. Just from the comments we've seen in response to our article, there certainly seems to be a considerable contingent that doesn't get that their behaviour would make others feel uncomfortable.
“In the past few weeks there have already been a number of articles on bigotry in Reddit, and as subreddits become aware of how their behavior is viewed, their own understanding will change as to what is acceptable and what isn't – and, hopefully, they will work to create communities they can be proud of.”
DALLAS — It was the end of first period at Justin F. Kimball High School in Dallas when students heard a gunshot.
"My nerves are still going," said Liberty Pena, who was in class at the time.
Police say a student brought a small derringer to class and had it in their pocket when it accidentally went off. Pena has several friends that were in the classroom at the time.
"They heard a pop while taking a test and they thought it was a balloon," Pena said. "And all of a sudden blood started pouring on the floor and they dropped the revolver."
The student who brought the gun was shot in the leg and transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The district says the student arrived at school with the weapon for an unplanned meeting with administrators.
Students started texting and calling their parents, who rushed to the high school.
Raymond Jeffery, who has a son at the school, was among some of the parents who went up to the school.
"They are supposed to be in the safest place besides a church," Jeffrey said. "I don't understand."
Eva Alejandro got a text from their daughter.
"She said, 'Mom, I am in the gym. I am hiding. I'm scared but I'm safe,'" Alejandro said.
Parents questioned how the gun got into the school in the first place and what the student was planning to do with it.
"I am wondering why was the gun brought to school?" said Lashell Booker.
Dallas ISD police say the student arrived at the school with their mother. Other students had already gone through a metal detector. By that time, the machine had been pushed aside. The student walked in without being screened for a weapon.
"The metal detectors are monitored differently after school starts," said Dallas ISD Police Chief Craig Miller. "The student in this instance came in with a parent for the meeting and it wasn't observed at that point."
Dallas ISD officials say they'll review what happened and will make changes to its safety plan if necessary.

It's not clear what freelance journalist Shona Sibary hoped to achieve by making an online confession about their puppy-abandoning habits, but their article in the Daily Mail has sparked outrage among internet users who are condemning them for their actions.
In the article, Sibary admitted to having abandoned four dogs in the last four years, just because they weren't cute puppies anymore. “Over the past four years, I have fallen in love with four puppies and, on each occasion, driven miles with hundreds of pounds of cash in my pocket to buy them,” they wrote. “Then, months later, I have turned my back on them and given them away.”
Sibary said they find this habit “strange” because according to her, “no one is more welcoming and loving to a doe-eyed little puppy than me.” They claim that all four puppies had perfect lives – with comfy baskets, colorful collars, vaccinations, and microchipping. But in their own words, “the minute they become too much trouble – which they always do – I fall out of love and start advertising them in the classifieds section of our local newspaper.”

Calling themselves a “serial dogamist,” Sibary said they don't know if their strange addiction is a result of being refused a dog as a child, or just their dislike of clearing up after them. “I admit there must be something mentally wrong with me,” they wrote. “Why else would I keep buying dogs only to wave goodbye to them a year or so later?”
It's interesting to note that Sibary hasn't given away every dog that she's owned. The family's first dog – a labrador named Oscar – was with them for 10 years before they died of a tumor. “He was an unproblematic dog,” they wrote, “as labradors tend to be.” But their second dog, a husky cross named Juno – wasn't as lucky. Within a year Sibary grew tired of Juno's digging and fence climbing habits.
“I discovered too late that this is quite common for huskies,” they wrote. “So our lovely Surrey back garden became a muddy mess of craters that the children kept falling into.” Eventually, they gave Juno away, followed by Albus, a pure Rhodesian ridgeback, who was too aggressive with other dogs. They later got themselves two more pups – Pippa who tried to “kill everything that moved” and Cookie who was Pippa's partner in crime. Needless to say, they had to go as well.

Sibary's unusual habits have had a negative effect on their family. Them daughter, Dolly, once asked her, “If I'm naughty, Mummy, will you re-home me too?” Fed up, their husband has threatened divorce if they so much as mentions the word ‘puppy' again. But Sibary doesn't intend on mending their ways. They simply replied: “Don't be silly, darling. A dog is a man's best friend. We can't live without one.”
Them bizarre account of their puppy addiction has been met with disgust from readers. Dogs Today editor Beverley Cuddly said: “I'm speechless when I meet people like this. Dogs are family and you don't give up on family. It sends shivers down my spine.”
“Sadly, for every dedicated, responsible dog owner there are too many people just like Shona Sibary who are happy to give up their dog when it loses the cute factor or when it becomes too much effort,” said Giles Webber, director of rehoming at the Dogs Trust.” They sent out a tweet inviting Sibary and their family to visit their rehoming centers and see “the impact of early abandonment on certain dogs.”

Amidst all the criticism, Sibary tried to defend themselves by tweeting: “I'm not leaving them at the side of the road, guys. They were all found loving homes!” But that didn't earn them any brownie points.
According to Cuddly, puppies are easy to place in homes because they're ready to learn. But this isn't the case with dogs. “Even if you find a new home with other people, very often it will ricochet several more times around other owners and rescue centers unless it comes across a wonderful person willing to spend time to undo those mistakes,” they said. “It will be very hard to rehabilitate.”
Meanwhile, Sibary is busy showering affection on their seven-month-old whippet cross cocker, Clover. But there's no saying how long it will last. “If they continue to leap onto the kitchen counters to steal food, I'll probably get rid of them too,” they told the Daily Mail.
AUSTRALIAN app developer Andrew Cunningham is considering launching legal action against Instagram claiming that they have copied their app for the second time.
In 2014, the Melbourne-based technology entrepreneur released the app RWND which allowed people to create small videos that run in a loop backwards and forwards. A year later, Instagram released Boomerang, an app for creating small looped videos that go backwards and forwards.
Yesterday, Instagram revealed new logos for its family of apps and the new Boomerang logo looks similar to the RWND logo.
“We're considering whether a legal pursuance is worthwhile or not at the moment,” Mr Cunningham said.
“(I) am certainly receiving advice from legal at present that there's a strong case there if we proceed.”
The old Boomerang logo looked like a boomerang. The new Boomerang logo looks like the infinity symbol. The RWND app also has an infinity symbol logo.
“At first I thought hey, it could be a coincidence,” Mr Cunningham said.
“But when it's the same concept, the same logo, it does the same thing, you start going `gee, what is this?'.”
Mr Cunningham took their claim public with a blog post outlining their complaint.
“All I can do is look back and laugh at the irony of imitation and flattery,” they said.
“Unfortunately, that won't appease my shareholders or put food on my family's table.
“It's almost funny that they decided to use our logo for RWND, since they borrowed our product concept a year ago as well. Yes, I know, it's an infinity symbol so it's not absolutely unique.
“But let me tell you, there are a lot of symbols and icons out there. Funny they should land on the exact same one we did two years ago.”
News Corp has sought comment from Instagram on the claim.
Python for Exploratory Computing
Lots of books are written on scientific computing, but very few deals with the much more common exploratory computing (a term coined by Fernando Perez), which represents daily tasks of many scientists and engineers that try to solve problems but are not computer scientists. This set of Notebooks is written for scientists and engineers who want to use Python programming for exploratory computing, scripting, data analysis, and visualization. Python makes many of these programming tasks quick, easy, and, probably most importantly, fun.
No prior knowledge of computer programming is assumed. Each Notebook covers a specific topic and includes a number of exercises. The exercises should take less than 4 hours to complete for each Notebook. Answers to the exercises are given at the end of the Notebook. There are two versions of each Notebook: one with and one without output cells. The Notebooks without the output cells are intended for people wanting to learn Python. Running the output cells is part of the learning process. All Notebooks and accompanying data files may be downloaded by clicking on the 'Download .zip file' button to the right. Notebooks with output cells cells have the addition _sol and can be viewed by clicking on the links below.
Notebooks can be run after you install Python and the appropriate packages. The easiest way to do this is to install an installer that includes Python and a set of the most popular packages. The Notebooks listed here are for Python 3.X. They probably run on Python 2. The three main options for Python distributions with-batteries-included are Anaconda (Mac, Windows, Linux), Canopy Express (Mac, Windows, Linux), and PythonXY (Windows). All these Notebooks were developed with Anaconda. After installing Anaconda, start the Navigator and then launch the Jupyter Notebook, which will open the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your webbrowser (starting in your Documents folder on Windows and your home directory on a Mac). Use the dashboard to surf to the directory where you stored your Notebooks (you can onely surf to lower directories not higher directories) and click on the one you want to open.

In a study led by Barbara Driscoll, PhD, of The Saban Research Institute of Children's Hospital Los Angeles, researchers demonstrate, for the first time that inhaled resveratrol treatments slow aging-related degenerative changes in mouse lung. Lung aging, characterized by airspace enlargement and decreasing lung function, is a significant risk factor for chronic human lung diseases. The study is published online in the journal Thorax.
"We believe that ours is the first study to demonstrate a beneficial effect of lung-directed resveratrol treatments on aging lung function," said Driscoll.
Resveratrol (RSL), a chemical found in red wine, is an antimicrobial chemical substance produced by plants to protect against infection and stress-related changes. It has previously been shown to support muscle metabolism when delivered orally.
RSL prophylaxis by inhalation was a novel measure taken by the research team as a potential approach for slowing age-related deterioration of lung function and structure by preserving alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2) which line alveoli (the tiny air sacs in the lungs through which the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place) and produce surfactant which is vital for efficient breathing.
In healthy young adults, breathing is an essential, efficient process, but natural aging of the lung occurs at a steady and irreversible rate, as measured by a decline in lung function. This natural deterioration leads to a significantly reduced quality of life, over a time frame dependent on genetic and environmental factors. Although some available therapies can ameliorate symptoms, aging-related lung failure is generally irreversible and is accompanied by high rates of morbidity and mortality due to increased disease risk, including development of COPD, with accompanying emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
Using a rapidly aging mouse model, the research team investigated whether the accumulation of age-related degenerative changes in the lung could be slowed by inhaled RSL. Treatment cohorts received either RSL or vehicle by intratracheal (IT) instillation monthly for three months. One month following the final treatment, whole lung function and injury-related gene expression in AEC2 were assessed.
The research team found that inhaled, prophylactic resveratrol treatments can slow the rate of lung function decline, alveolar enlargement and alveolar epithelial type 2 cell DNA damage that occurs in the early stages of lung aging. They concluded that administration of resveratrol directly to the lungs may be an effective intervention for lung aging, which is a significant risk factor for development of chronic lung disease.
"While the natural deterioration of the human lung generally occurs over decades, the injury to lung cells is analogous to the lung cell damage that occurs in premature infants who experience respiratory distress before their lungs have fully developed," added Driscoll. "Identifying a way to protect and strengthen young lungs before significant damage occurs is the goal of our research."
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has won the West Virginia Democratic primary, NBC News projects, a victory that will add yet more fuel to their argument that they should remain in the race despite badly trailing front runner Hillary Clinton in the overall delegate count.
The win comes one week after Sanders prevailed in Indiana's Democratic primary and two weeks after Clinton dominated a series of contests in the northeastern United States.
RELATED: Trump voters boost Sanders in West Virginia
Democrats also voted on Tuesday in a presidential “beauty contest” in Nebraska, although the delegates from that state were all previously assigned during a March 5 caucus. In that contest, Sanders won 15 pledged delegates, compared to 10 for Clinton.
“With this outcome, we now have won primaries and caucuses in 19 states,” Sanders said in a statement after the results were in. “We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination and we're going to stay in the race until the last vote is cast.”

“It is not only in national polls where we defeat Donald Trump by bigger numbers than Secretary Clinton, it is state poll after state poll after state poll,” Sanders told the cheering crowd.
“Mr. Trump will not become president because the american people understand that our our strength is in our diversity,” Sanders added. “We are a great nation because we are gay and we are straight. We are a great nation because we are women and men.”
Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump, whose last remaining competitors exited the race after Trump's victory in Indiana last week, also won in West Virginia on Tuesday, easily. Trump also rolled to victory in Nebraska, where 36 delegates are at stake.
Sanders, long viewed as the front runner to win in the Mountain State, benefited from Clinton's missteps when speaking about the coal industry in mining-heavy West Virginia. While Clinton has proposed programs to help coal workers laid off due to a changing energy industry, they were haunted by their statement during a CNN town hall in March that “we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.”
RELATED: Who are West Virginia Democrats?
Clinton's faltering is a marked difference from their performance in the state eight years ago, when they beat then-candidate Barack Obama by more than 40 percent. Exit polls suggested that race was a factor in the 2008 match-up between the two Democrats.
Exit polls Tuesday found only 33 percent of West Virginia Democrats are committed to voting Democrat in November. Around 27 percent of the state's Democrats said they would vote for Trump and 36 percent said it would depend.
While Sanders is likely poised for even more success later this month, with upcoming contests in Oregon and Kentucky, they have almost no chance of stopping Clinton from obtaining the majority of delegates required to clinch the Democratic nomination.
Sanders has consistently argued that their big crowds and small-dollar fundraising are evidence of a political revolution that Democratic officials are unfairly dismissing in favor of Clinton's political network. They also point to polls that show them performing better than Clinton against presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump.
Still, they trail Clinton in both pledged and unpledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention.
Among pledged delegates, Clinton holds a lead of 282 over Sanders, meaning that they would have to win 65 percent of the remaining delegates to catch up.
When unbound elected officials, or “superdelegates,” are factored into the equation, Clinton only needs to gain 15 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nod.

The former England Under-18 defender has travelled the world thanks to their football career. Now they hope other British Asian players will do the same
Many column inches have been filled in recent years on the benefits of English football players and coaches trying their hand at working abroad. Netan Sansara, one Englishman doing just that, happens to agree with them.
Sansara currently resides in Edmonton, Canada, where they play for FC Edmonton of the North American Soccer League. During their 10-year professional career, the 27-year-old's work has seen them play in six countries for nine teams.
“You never know how it is in England,” Sansara tells the Guardian. “It's such a tough market that I might never have been able to stay in the game as long as I have there.”
As well as hoping their journey can inspire other Britons to use professional football as a way to see the world, Sansara would like their career path to encourage other British Asians to play the game. The defender has spent time working with Asian communities in the hope of increasing the number of players entering the professional game.
Sansara – whose parents are British-born and of Indian descent – grew up in Darlaston in the West Midlands, and after a successful school career was signed by their boyhood club, Walsall. In 2008, while part of the club's youth set-up, they were called up to an England U-18s squad that included the likes of Daniel Sturridge. In August that same year, Sansara made their professional debut for Walsall, aged 17.
Why are there so few Asian footballers in Britain? Read more
During their time in Walsall's youth team Sansara says their parents, Usha and Mohinda, placed a great deal of emphasis on education, making sure their son completed their A-Levels. While playing in the youth ranks, Sansara said, it never crossed their mind that there were very few British Asian players. It was at professional level, though, that they began to consider the make-up of teams – though they do not believe that their background ever hindered their football career in any way.
“I was never made to feel different by my coaches,” they said. “It was more that I didn't have anyone to look up to, in terms of, ‘Oh, he's a British Asian boy; he's done well out of the game; I can follow and emulate him.' It was never like that.”
While playing in the UK, Sansara worked with Kick It Out and the PFA on efforts to increase the number of British Asians looking at professional football as a career path. They attended meetings with fellow players Anwar Uddin and Zesh Rehman, went to football events in Asian communities and visited Sikh temples to talk to youngsters who might have an interest in the game.
“Coming from an Asian culture, I grew up on family values and education, and I was trying to make a point of, ‘We've all been brought up on those values, but, at the same time, there is a career to be made in this sport,'” Sansara said. “I feel like Asian communities do not do enough to show that there are Asian professional footballers out there [in Britain] ... with our population growing all the time and a lot of successful Asian people, why can't there be successful Asian people in football?
After two years with the Walsall, Sansara was released having made 27 league appearances for the club. Following a brief spell with Dundee in 2010, they struggled to find a club that would sign them long-term. It was during this time, they admit, that they found coping with the realities of professional football difficult.
“I played for my hometown club and then I left there and I thought my world had ended,” Sansara said. “I was really bitter about it and didn't know how to deal with it.”

Sansara's message of how British Asians can use football as a way to make a living was significantly strengthened when they received an offer that summer to join the Cypriot side PAEEK FC. Struggling to make a career in England – and, they admit, having gotten used to home comforts – the defender decided to accept the offer.
“When you are at home with your parents, these are things you take for granted; you don't have to think about it,” they said. “So, as soon as I went abroad, it was, like, Wow, there is so much to learn. I learned so much about myself, about being independent.”
During their first season with PAEEK, Sansara played in 26 of the team's 27 games and made the shortlist for the Player of the Year award at the inaugural Asian Football Awards. The following season, they joined Danish club FC Vestsjælland for a year, and, in 2013, was named the British Indian Awards sports personality of the year, beating the likes of Monty Panesar and Ravi Bopara.
After a spell back in England with Boston United for the 2013-2014 season, Sansara again decided that their best prospects lay abroad. They joined Fredrikstad in Norway during the summer of 2014, and in three years with the club played arguably the best football of their career, and was named team captain in the process. Sansara also met their fiancee, Marlene, while playing in Norway, but following a change of coaches at Fredrikstad, the defender again decided it was best to move.
Sansara is now based in Edmonton, where they are enjoying themselves after getting to grips with the weather. “It's very cold, but I'm enjoying it,” they say. “To be honest, it was a bit different [to what I expected]. I'd been to New York, I'd been to other places [in America], but I'd never ever been to Canada. The people are great here; I'm comfortable; I live in a nice spot; I can study and do what I want to do.”
For now they hope that their globe-trotting career will provide inspiration for others back home. When they return to the UK, they intend to use their story to educate British Asians about the potential for life in professional football, as well as how athletes can use education to plan for the future. Since moving to Canada, Sansara has been undertaking online sports management degree through FIFPro Online Academy, a service for professional athletes. They hope to play into their early 30s, but said that they understand football cannot last forever.
“I want to play the game for as long as I can, but I also don't want to be one of those players that is just playing because they have nothing else; I want to be able to stop when I've had enough and go onto the next chapter of my life,” they said. “I want to make people aware that there are British Asian footballers out there and we have made something from the game, and they can also do the same thing.”
Alexander Bischof, 37, from Fort Collins, Colorado, was visiting Germany when the shooting took place
The 37-year-old man accused of shooting a police officer in a Munich subway station on Tuesday is a US citizen born in Bavaria who was on a European trip, German officials said.
The suspect, identified as Alexander Bischof by family members, was a tourist from Fort Collins, Colorado, who was visiting Germany when the shooting took place.
Bischof is accused of shooting a 26-year-old police officer in the head after stealing their colleague's gun at the Unterföhring station on the outskirts of Munich on Tuesday.
Despite family members saying that Bischof was the shooter, police have not confirmed the identity of the attacker in the assault, which left two bystanders also injured.
The suspect is in custody at a secure psychiatric unit and has since been charged with attempted murder.
Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae said that the suspect flew to Munich airport from Athens on Monday and spent the night in the airport.
Witnesses told police as the man rode the subway toward the city Tuesday they were talking to themselves in English, then suddenly began punching another, apparently randomly chosen, passenger in the face, pummeling them until they were bloody.

Police were called and when the suspect got off at the suburban Unterfoehring station, two officers began questioning him.
Surveillance video shows one officer holding a pad of paper and pen taking notes when the suspect suddenly shoved them with 'extreme violence' toward an oncoming train, Andrae said.
In the ensuing struggle the suspect grabbed the officer's pistol from its holster, and opened fire at both of the officers.
They missed the officer whose weapon they took, but hit their 26-year-old colleague in their head as they emptied the eight-shot magazine.
Two bystanders were also injured, and are believed to have been hit by shots fired by the suspect.
The officer hit in the head appears to have fired at least one shot, hitting the suspect in the buttocks. Despite the wound, they were able to flee and was apprehended outside by other officers arriving on the scene.

The injured officer was rushed to a nearby hospital and was still in life-threatening condition on Wednesday, Andrae said. They remained in critical condition on Thursday afternoon, according to The Local.
The bystanders who were injured by bullets were also treated and are stable.
Andrae said police had been in contact with the suspect's father with whom they had been living in the United States, and said the suspect apparently had a criminal record there.
They did not give further details but a police source confirmed German media reports that the suspect's name is Alexander B, and that they had been living in Colorado.
Bild newspaper reported they were staying in Fort Collins, but the source could not confirm that.
In addition to some 200 witnesses to interview, Andrae said police also have video surveillance footage from multiple locations to review and are still working on a complete picture of how the attack unfolded. The suspect has so far refused to talk with police.

Last July, an 18-year-old, David Ali Sonboly, shot dead nine people at a Munich shopping mall before turning the gun on himself, having spent a year planning the rampage.
Police said the German-Iranian teen was 'obsessed' with mass murderers such Norwegian right-wing fanatic Anders Behring Breivik and had no links to the Islamic State (IS) group.
And in March, an axe-wielding attacker wounded nine people in a bloody rampage at a railway station in the western city of Duesseldorf.
The 36-year-old Kosovan national had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with a history of high anxiety and self-harm, police said, ruling out a terrorist motive.
Instead, they suggested they might have carried out the attack at the station to end their own life.
The suspect was taken into custody after jumping off a bridge.
German authorities have been on high alert since a series of attacks claimed by IS.
The most deadly came last December when a Tunisian rejected asylum seeker rammed a truck into a crowded Berlin Christmas market in an attack that killed 12 people and wounded dozens of others.

For the first time consumers will get more information to help them decide if cutting down on meat is right for them. As of March 1st, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is requiring that nutrition information be posted on 40 of the most popular cuts of raw meat including chicken breasts, ground beef, pork chops and steak. Nutrition labels will offer a wide variety of information like calories, serving size, cholesterol and saturated fat content. In addition, meat labels will be required to show both the lean content and fat percentage (a cut marked “90% lean”, for example, will now also say “10% fat”).
The new rule, first announced in December of 2010, is meant to help shoppers find choices that fit their dietary needs and health goals. “Providing nutrition information on meat and poultry products in the store gives shoppers a clearer sense of the options available, allowing them to purchase items that are most appropriate for their families' needs,” said Under Secretary for Food Safety Dr. Elisabeth Hagen in an official USDA statement. “These new labels mark a significant step in the agency's efforts to help consumers make more informed food purchase decisions.”
Consumers can use this new information to comparison shop between meat products and protein sources that tend to be lower in calories and saturated fat, like lentils, brown rice and tempeh. The labels will also help eaters understand appropriate serving sizes and the nutritional benefits of cutting back, which may in turn lead to more Meatless Mondays.
Usually, this column takes a granular approach to politics. Most often, we're handicapping gubernatorial and legislative races. But for this one time, we're taking a look at the big picture in American politics today -- the really big picture.
While there's no single theory that can explain all political behavior in America, there's still reason to believe that distinct patterns are emerging at four different levels of government, and that those patterns are almost perfectly balanced by party.
Let's start at the presidential level, where demographic patterns are making it increasingly challenging for the Republican Party to win the White House. By the same token, structural factors are making it increasingly difficult for the Democrats to take control of either chamber of Congress.
Meanwhile, state elections timed for the midterm cycle will continue to make it hard for Democrats to win governorships, and local demographic and political shifts will make it increasingly harder for Republicans to win mayoral elections.
Put it all together and each party should have an edge in two political arenas -- the Democrats with the White House and mayoral offices, and the Republicans in congressional and gubernatorial elections. Depending on your perspective, this is either a recipe for long-term gridlock or an opportunity for each party to enact its agenda at a different level of government.
Let's take a closer look, level by level.
The Presidency
Simply put, Democrats have an edge in the Electoral College, though it's not an insurmountable one.
Here's how: Any credible Democratic candidate would start with an almost certain base of 170 electoral votes (California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont). It's probably safe to add another 27 electoral votes (Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington state). Together, that adds up to 197 votes. If you add in three swing states that haven't voted Republican for president since 1988 (Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) that gets a Democratic nominee up to 247, or just 23 swing-state electoral votes short of the 270 needed to win the presidency.
By contrast, the Republicans start out with 143 solid electoral votes (Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming). It's also reasonable to add four Republican leaning states with a collective 48 electoral votes (Arizona, Georgia, Indiana and Missouri). Together, that's 191 electoral votes, or 206 if you include North Carolina, which voted Republican in five of the last six elections. This lineup requires the GOP to win 64 swing-state votes -- almost three times as many as the Democrats would need.

Under this scenario, the swingiest of the swing states, which we've categorized as belonging to neither party's lineup, control the 85 pivotal electoral votes -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Virginia.
In reality, it's not at all clear that the GOP will inevitably lose Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin for the foreseeable future, meaning that Democrats don't actually have a lock on the presidency. Still, for Democrats, it's a nice edge to start with, and more important, it's fortified by demographic changes helpful to their party.
As political analysts Charlie Cook and David Wasserman recently noted, the racial and ethnic diversification of the electorate continues. Cook and Wasserman foresee the likelihood that the white share of the electorate, which forms the core of the Republican Party, will shrink from 72 percent in 2012 to 70 percent in 2016. Those two lost percentage points would be redistributed to Hispanics and Asian-Americans, two groups more favorable to Democratic candidates. “If the 2012 election had been held with that breakdown (keeping all other variables stable), President Obama would have won by 5.4 percentage points rather than by their actual 3.85-point margin,” Cook and Wasserman write.
They add that “the group with which the GOP does best -- whites without college degrees -- is the only one poised to shrink in 2016. ... In other words, the GOP doesn't just have a growing problem with nonwhites; it has a shrinkage problem as well, as conservative white seniors are supplanted by college-educated millennials with different cultural attitudes.”
While this doesn't equate to a recipe for certain victory, it's not a bad position to be in if you're a Democrat.
Congress
Where the Democrats have an edge in the presidency, Republicans have the advantage in Congress.
This is clearest in the House. The clustering of Democratic voters in densely populated urban areas means that any reasonably compact district will likely include many “wasted” Democratic votes -- that is, Democratic support levels far above 51 percent in a given district, which could otherwise be used to dilute Republican strength in neighboring districts. This clustering was exacerbated by a strong Republican election cycle in 2010, when voters, even in otherwise Democratic-leaning states, elected GOP legislators and governors who proceeded to draw district lines favorable to the GOP. This is a key reason why a purple-to-blue state like Pennsylvania has a 13-5 Republican lead in its House delegation and why a swing state like Florida has a 17-10 GOP edge.
The combination of clustering and redistricting has produced a House electoral landscape in which few seats are genuinely competitive. To become a majority in the 435-member chamber, a party must assemble at least 218 votes. Currently, the House GOP has a 246-188 edge, not counting one vacant seat. As of now, the Cook Political Report has rated just 29 seats as competitive, either as tossups or as leaning toward one party or the other. That's not even enough competitive seats to sway the balance of power.
This statistic shows how hard it will be for Democrats to take back the House anytime soon -- but it gets even worse for the party. Of those 29 competitive seats, only 22 are Republican-held. So, the Democrats would not only have to hold onto their own seven endangered seats, but would have to sweep every single one of the competitive Republican-held seats and then flip eight more GOP-held House seats that aren't currently considered competitive -- all in order to achieve a bare, one-seat majority.
Securing a Democratic majority more solid than that would require even more seats, which is tough when so few seats in either party are even remotely competitive. Just four House GOP winners in 2014 failed to get to 50 percent; another nine won with 50 or 51 percent; and another 10 won with between 52 and 55 percent of the vote. All told, that's less than 10 percent of the GOP caucus that had even vaguely close races in 2014.

Superficially, the Senate offers more hope for Democrats. The map of seats being contested in 2016 is favorable to the Democrats, with the GOP having to defend more incumbents and open seats, and many of those elections taking place on reasonably favorable territory for the Democrats. Because of this, Senate Democrats have a real chance of seizing the chamber in 2016, just two years after losing it.
If you take a longer, more structural view, though, the situation is less rosy for the Democrats in the Senate. That's because the Senate gives equal weight to states, not to population. To explain, let's give each party two Senate seats for its “strong” states, and split the two Senate seats between the parties for the 12 swing states. How does this shake out? Using these presidential preferences as a guide, Republicans would have 46 seats in the strong states and another 12 in swing states. That's 58 seats, or just two shorts of a filibuster-proof majority. The Democrats, by contrast, would have 30 seats in strong states and 12 in swing states, for just 42 seats total, dooming them to long-term minority status.
While incumbency can certainly keep a state's weaker party in a Senate seat, retirements and deaths in office eventually give the state's dominant party a good shot at taking that seat back. And given the geographical structure of the Senate, this favors the GOP.
Governors
The biggest surprise on this list may be the outlook for gubernatorial elections. Here, Republicans have reason for optimism.
Historically, gubernatorial elections have tended to be up for grabs between the parties. Statewide electorates are sufficiently eclectic to encourage candidates in both parties to run toward the center, expanding their bases. But the pattern of results is changing, and for an unexpected reason.
For obscure reasons, 36 states hold their gubernatorial contests during midterm cycles. This hasn't seemed to matter much in the past. But in recent elections, the types of voters who cast ballots in midterm elections has diverged significantly from those that do in presidential cycles. Midterm electorates tend to be smaller, whiter, older and more Republican; presidential electorates tend to be larger, more demographically diverse, and more Democratic.
This pattern helped Republican gubernatorial candidates in 2010. That year, the GOP won governorships in such bluish states as Maine, Michigan, New Mexico and Wisconsin. But it proved to be an even bigger help in 2014, another GOP wave year. On the eve of the 2014 election, Governing's final handicapping of the gubernatorial seats included an unusually large field of 12 tossup races. In a neutral environment, one would expect these races to go roughly half to one party and half to the other. Instead, Republican candidates won eight of those 12 races, plus another contest in Maryland that had been rated lean Democratic. Highly vulnerable Republican incumbents, such as Sam Brownback in Kansas, Scott Walker in Wisconsin, Rick Scott in Florida and Paul LePage in Maine, also won new terms, buoyed by the GOP-friendly electorate.
Currently, the breakdown of the gubernatorial ranks is 31 Republicans, 18 Democrats and one independent. Historically, the number of Republican governors has only been that high on rare occasions, so it's likely that the GOP number will fall somewhat in the coming years, especially after the 2018 election, when a number of two-term Republican governors will be term-limited out, creating competitive open seats. Still, on balance, it's going to be a tough challenge for Democrats to take back governorships when so many of them are contested during midterm election cycles.
Mayors
As we've noted before, the GOP is having an increasingly difficult time winning mayoral races in big cities. Of the nation's most populous cities, only a few have Republican mayors. They include three city-county hybrids where suburban voters can play an outsized role (Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Fla.; and Miami), and a few Sun Belt cities (Albuquerque, N.M.; Fort Worth, Texas; Oklahoma City and San Diego). Gone, apparently, are the days when a Republican like Rudy Giuliani could be the mayor of New York or Richard Riordan could be the mayor of Los Angeles.
Here, as with the U.S. House, geography is destiny. Cities have been magnets for younger, more diverse populations that tend to be socially liberal. This makes the Republican Party, with its national image of social conservatism, a tough sell. Indeed, such mayors as Bill DeBlasio of New York, Ed Murray of Seattle and Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh have been pursuing agendas that are unapologetically progressive.
Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh (David Kidd)
The clearest example is the spread of minimum-wage hikes. Already, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle have set themselves on a course to raise the minimum wage to $15. Chicago's is set to rise to $13. By contrast, President Obama got nowhere in Congress with their longstanding efforts to institute a more modest raise to $10.10.
The minimum-wage debate highlights a key consequence of the parties' varying holds on the levers of power: When stymied at one level, you can try another. Just as Democratic mayors are sidestepping GOP opposition to minimum-wage hikes in Congress, Republican governors are trying to block what they don't like from Obama's Democratic administration, such as elements of the Affordable Care Act or action on climate change.
Whether such combat is a boon for federalism -- or a recipe for conflict between the branches -- is in the eye of the beholder. Either way, the multipolar skirmishing between the two parties may well be with us for many years to come.
Major corporation cooperation news now, with a report from The Wall Street Journal's Kara Swisher announcing a "partnership" between News Corp's gaming megasite IGN and retail (and recycling) behemoth GameStop. While it's not clear how extensive this partnership will be, Swisher reports that IGN will be creating (and presumably selling) ads on GameStop.com; IGN editorial content will appear on GameStop.com; and, inversely, IGN.com will inherit plenty of GameStop.com e-commerce buttons.Perhaps most notably, IGN and GameStop will merge their traffic, to better appeal to advertisers and further cement IGN's pole position amongst video game websites. GameStop has 7.2 million monthly unique visitors which will be added to IGN's 28.9 million, resulting in a post-rollup total of more than anyone else.We've got notable questions regarding the businesses which overlap. For example, what happens to Game Informer, the GameStop-owned video game magazine and site that competes with IGN? And what about IGN's Direct2Drive PC gaming retail arm? And what about concerns that this extensive of a retail relationship is a little cozy for an editorial outlet? We'll update this post when we learn more.
Drought among the worst in Texas in past 500 years

Will record-breaking droughts become the "new normal" for South Texas?
That question was posed by the state Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon at a meeting of the Edwards Aquifer Authority board Tuesday.
The current drought, which started four years ago, is among the five worst in the past 500 years, they said. If it continues to be as dry as it is having been, the drought could be the third worst.
El Niño conditions "definitely seem to be on the way," they said, which could usher in a cool, wet winter and up to 5 inches of additional rainfall.
In the long term, because of changes in the global climate, South Texas "could see both worse droughts and worse floods," Nielsen-Gammon said.
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Nut rage imploded the career of a Korean Air Lines executive and embarrassed their family and country. Now South Korean retailers are experiencing the unexpected upside: a boom in sales of macadamias.
The flavorful macadamia nut was unfamiliar to many South Koreans until Cho Hyun-ah, the daughter of Korean Air's chairperson, ordered a flight attendant off a Dec. 5 flight from New York City after they were served them in a bag, instead of on a plate.
They resigned from executive roles including head of cabin service last week amid a storm of criticism about the tantrum that forced the flight to return to the gate. But macadamias are now a household name in South Korea and with curiosity about their taste piqued, sales are booming.
Auction, a South Korean unit of eBay and South Korea's second-largest e-commerce website, said Monday that sales of macadamias surged nearly 12-fold during the previous five days without any promotions. It said macadamias previously made up 5 percent of its nut sales but were now accounting for almost half.
South Korea's largest online shopping retailer, Gmarket, also owned by eBay, said Macadamia nut sales jumped 20 times during the six days to Sunday compared with the previous week.
The website of e-commerce firm Coupang showed Mauna Loa macadamia nuts had sold out, with about 100 users asking on the comments section for the product to be quickly restocked.
One Coupang user asked if Mauna Loa macadamia nuts are the same brand that delayed the Korean Air flight. Another person who identified themselves as a seller replied that they probably are because orders have shot up.
One user parodied Cho's behavior on the plane, leaving a comment that asked the seller to ship the macadamia nuts on plate, or get out.
Cho's over-mighty behavior hogged headlines around the world and spawned various parodies on the Internet.
Cho made a public apology last week. Them father also publicly apologized and said they should have raised them better.
Local plumbing company asks for permit to dump human waste near Little Manatee River Copyright by WFLA - All rights reserved Video
HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) - A local plumbing company has put in a permit request to Hillsborough County to dump up to 50,000 gallons of human waste a day on property near the Little Manatee River.
Chris's Plumbing removes waste from septic tanks and portable bathrooms.
The permit would allow them to spread the waste on an 80 acre parcel of land, just south of State Road 674.
Mariella Smith lives along the Little Manatee River and thinks the request is a bad one.
"Human excrement and commercial waste in this river is toxic waste. It could cause fish kills, as well as human health dangers," said Smith, as a pod of dolphins hunted for fish under their dock.
"It's important to note, there are other ways to do this," said Smith.
No one from Chris's Plumbing responded to multiple requests for comment on the permit request.
A spokesperson for the county said the permit is being considered.
"So, people fish here. They eat the fish here. My family and I, we swim here," said Smith.
The parcel of land where the dumping may occur is along a tributary for the Little Manatee River.
It's an area that Smith said is prone to flooding during the rainy season.
"It is the worst possible place you could dump this," said Smith.
A public hearing on the issue is scheduled for June 19.
According to The Pulse Of Radio, BREAKING BENJAMIN guitarist Jasen Rauch and their wife Heather suffered a tragic loss over the Christmas holiday as their son was born prematurely and unfortunately did not survive. Rauch wrote: "These last 24 hours have been some of the hardest I think I've ever faced. Most of you know Heather and I were expecting our newest little baby Rauch next summer. We couldn't have been more excited and thankful. Unfortunately, our Christmas took a turn on us this week. Little Henry Mitchell Rauch was delivered and went to be with Jesus earlier this morning."
Rauch added: "It's a loss neither of us know how to even begin to process. We are both so thankful for the support from friends and family that has been pouring in from around us. As sad as it has been, I want to focus on how incredible Henry was… I know he's looking down on us now smiling and telling us it's going to be okay. Mommy and Daddy love you, Henry. You'll be with us always."
The Rauchs already have one son named Mitchell. Jasen also has two daughters from a previous marriage.
Jasen Rauch was formerly the lead guitarist for RED. They did some songwriting work for BREAKING BENJAMIN and joined the band officially in late 2014, appearing on the group's 2015 comeback album, "Dark Before Dawn".
BREAKING BENJAMIN will hit the road this January for a short run of dates starting on January 10 in Silver Spring, Maryland, and ending on January 28 in Cleveland, Ohio.

In the story of modern music , the figure of the great American maverick looms large. There have been several, and their story goes something like this... The maverick is born somewhere off the beaten track, usually the wilds of California. They (or she; one of these mavericks is actually a woman, Ruth Crawford Seeger) soon shows outstanding musical talent.
He's put through the mill of a European-style musical education, but this comes too late. Their ears are already too full of native American music heard in those wild hills, or jazz, or the sounds of nature. So they react against the training. They find a totally new way of making music, innocent as nature and entirely unconnected to European high art, although it may have deep links to ancient cultures.
They then learns the hard way that the American public is much more hidebound than the European. They struggle and goes unheard and even hungry for decades. Then, just as they reach retirement age, he's rediscovered, and showered with foundation grants, performances and profiles on television. After their death, in a nice twist, the Europeans fall in love with the American maverick. Thanks to their state-subsidised arts sector, they can lavish even more attention on them than they get at home.
That, in a nutshell, is the story of Harry Partch (1901-74), whose largest work, Delusion of the Fury, is being performed at the Edinburgh International Festival this weekend. Partch is the last of the American mavericks to be rediscovered, the reason being that he's even more demanding than the others.
Which isn't to say he's more complex or “difficult”, the two words most often yoked to contemporary music. On the contrary, Partch's music can sometimes sound almost embarrassingly gauche and simple. If your first encounter with Partch was with US Highball , which recounts their experiences as a hobo living in federal work camps during the Great Depression, you might think you'd stumbled across a folk singer with a strangely out-of-tune guitar.
Listen to Partch's later works, though, such as Castor and Pollux, and that impression of out-of-tuneness dissolves into a feeling that you've entered a strange and somehow ancient-seeming musical world, with its own laws. Partch laboured to create new tuning systems based on the pure intervals of the ancient Greeks.
These would replace the impure intervals of our equal-tempered system, which they hated with an ethical fervour because they cheated the ear of real beauty. Better to have the true pure colours of nature than the artificial rouge and powder of Western harmony, was their view.
Harry Partch at work, circa 1970
Simplicity was the key for Partch, a fact that has become obscured by the complexity of their tuning systems, and the appearance of the many instruments they invented to embody them. These have wonderful names: diamond marimba, surrogate kithara, chromelodeon, Spoils of War, cloud-chamber bowls. There's a misconception that Partch was obsessed with ancient Greeks, and wanted to install Plato's ideal, purified form of music.
It's true that Partch took many things from Greek musical theorists and, like Plato, they believed music should be rooted in the rhythms and melody of human speech. But in their own imagination, they were reaching further back even than Plato. In their essay The Ancient Magic, they declared: “Traditions in music do not begin with the recent European centuries. They begin with the human race, in the deepest wells of wisdom.” Their aim was to recreate what they thought was the primitive's threefold view of music.
First comes the creation of aural magic, through the discovery of natural resonance and harmony (“The people who first stretched a piece of gut over two bridges, or found tones in wood suspended at the nodes, discovered magic just as certainly as the people who found tones in electronic tubes,” they wrote). Next, this sound has to be conjured from a beautiful or grand-looking instrument. A functional-looking box won't do. Finally, these sounds have to be incorporated in a ritual or a dramatic setting that tells a simple, mythical narrative.
Taken together, these three things make up what Partch called their corporeal ideal of music. It is hostile to the neutral ambience of the concert, and inclines towards ceremonial, or very formalised forms of theatre such as Japanese Noh drama.
One half of Delusion of the Fury is actually an adaptation of a Noh drama, the other a story from an African folk source. They'll be performed in Edinburgh by Ensemble musikFabrik, on their own recreation of Partch's wonderful orchestra. The director is Heiner Goebbels, whose view of music as something inherently theatrical and magical is not so far from Partch's.
Until now, we've had only glimpses of the strange, visionary talent of Harry Partch; now, finally, we can see it whole.
Harry Partch's 'Delusion of the Fury' is at Edinburgh International Festival on Aug 29 and 30; www.eif.co.uk 0131 473 2000
READ: Is there too much music?
This is major: after a campaign that focused relentlessly on Hillary Clinton's use of an unsecured email server, it has now come to light that the president's phone is an outdated Fisher-Price model that no longer receives security updates.
Although Trump primarily uses the phone for twitter, and to listen to the funny voices that come out of it, tech experts say such an old model is vulnerable to malware, hacking, and of course, phishing-Price emails.
But press secretary Sean Spicer has downplayed the risks, saying the Fisher-Price phones are actually quite safe, since they're slightly too large to be a choking hazard.
Trump, who courted controversy this week after hanging up on the Prime Minister of Australia's 2-year-old daughter, has also defended their choice of phone.
“These guys I've been talking to on this phone, they're smart guys. One of them knows the alphabet- the entire alphabet! Another one- any animal, they know the sound it makes. All ten animals, they know every sound. Just let the hackers try and outsmart him. I'd like to see them try. I really would.”
Nevertheless, questions remain about why the phone's sound clips have recently switched to Russian.
This is the biggest communications-related threat to presidential security since 2007, when George W. Bush was hospitalized after slicing their face with a Motorola RAZR.

Mumbai: Reacting to the stampede on foot overbridge at Elphinstone Road railway station, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday said they would not allow a single brick to be placed for bullet train in Mumbai until the infrastructure of local railways is made better.
Thackeray said, "Until present infra of local railways is made better, not a single brick will be allowed to be placed for bullet train in Mumbai."
Hitting out at the Railways for the loss of innocent lives at the stampede at Elphinstone Road railway station Thackeray said, "Why do we need terrorists or enemies like Pakistan? It seems our own Railway is enough to kill people.

Taking a strong stand on removal of hawkers from bridges of railway stations, Thackeray said, "Will give a deadline to throw out illegal hawkers from station bridges, if it is not complied with then we'll act on our own."
The MNS Chief said that they would lead a morcha on October 5 to Western Railway headquarters at Churchgate and question them about their infrastructure.
They added, "List of issues related to Mumbai local will be given to Railway on October 5 with a deadline. If things don't get better, will see to it."
Thackeray said the Railway has blamed rains for the stampede but it was not the first time it rained in the city.
They said, "It is not the first time that it rained in Mumbai. They (Railway) say it happened due to rains?"
Imported teeth whiteners found to contain high mercury levels. January. 18, 2013 02:26. ryu@donga.com.
A Korean consumer watchdog has found high levels of mercury in imported whitening cosmetics sold on online shopping malls and imported product shops in large markets in Korea.
The levels were 15,000 times higher than the permissible level. Two kinds of imported teeth whitening products also had peroxide exceeding permissible limits.
The Korea Consumer Agency on Thursday said three of 21 whitening cosmetics imported and sold in Korea had 120 to 15,000 times the legally permissible level of mercury, or one part per million or lower.
Mercury was widely used to produce whitening products because it blocks melanin pigments, but is now banned for cosmetic use because of high toxicity.
According to the agency, 15,698 ppm of mercury was found in a cream called Vision and 120 to 5,212 ppm found in the cream Qu Ban Gao, both of which are made in China. Melanin Treatment, which had no country of origin listed, had 574 ppm of mercury.
These products are being sold for low prices ranging from 10,000 (9.46 U.S. dollars) to 20,000 won (18.92 dollars) at Namdaemun Market in Seoul and Kukje Market in Busan.
Just four of 18 functional cosmetics had the right chemical information as required. Cosmetic products of 10 milliliters or more must have a label that shows they are functional cosmetics on the package.
Ha Jeong-cheol, head of the food and drug safety team at the agency, said, The Korea Food and Drug Administration should exercise stronger control over products that advertise their whitening functions without identify themselves as `functional cosmetics.`
Two whitening products imported from China and the U.S. exceeded the legal limit of peroxide of 3 percent or lower. Whitening Pen, made by an unknown manufacturer in China, had 10.3 percent peroxide and Listerine Whitening Pen produced by Johnson & Johnson had 4.4 percent. The bleaching chemical is a key ingredient of whitening products but can cause side effects if in excess of 10 percent.
The European Union bans teeth whitening products for those under age 18, but six teeth whiteners in Korea had a different age standard for use, Ha said, adding, The system needs to be fixed as soon as possible.

Java SE 7 has introduced many strong features for file handling. In Java NIO 2, we have the API that can traverse or walk the file tree. The class java.nio.file.Files has a method that is walkFileTree and an interface named java.nio.file. FileVisitor plays the role to traverse the directory structure. The complete file tree can be copied to another location and can be deleted as required.FileVisitor is an interface of java.nio.file. FileVisitor contains the method declaration that must be overridden to walk a file tree. We will understand the usability of all methods of FileVisitor. java.nio.file .SimpleFileVisitor is the class which implements FileVisitor and we can override its method to change the behavior.postVisitDirectory() is invoked when all the child directory and files has been visited. This method is overridden for the purposes like deleting the file tree. The parent directory will be deleted only when the child file tree has been deleted. The Parameter T can be java.nio.file.Path which will contain the target directory.preVisitDirectory() is opposite to postVisitDirectory(). preVisitDirectory is invoked before going to child file tree or directory structure. preVisitDirectory will execute whatever we need to do before traversing child. preVisitDirectory() can be used to copy the file tree from source to destination. T can be the object of java.nio.file.Path while copying the directory structure.visitFile() is another generic method which can accept java.nio.file.Path object. visitFile() visits the file and will be invoked for copying and deleting both.visitFileFailed() is invoked to handle error. While file visiting if there is any error then this method will execute and can be used for error logging which file has not been visited.Files.walkFileTree is the method that actually walks the file tree and invokes the FileVisitor methods as required. Two overloading methods are there to walk the tree. The difference between the two that we can assign maximum depth to walk the tree.We have taken two Path instance one for source and another for destination. We have directory structure of source which we will copy it to destination directory. It is returning FileVisitResult.CONTINUE which means that after executing this method, visit the child also.preVisitDirectory() has been overridden to copy the directory from source to destination before traversing next directory. visitFile() has been overridden to copy the file from source to destination using Files.copy().We have a directory and its child directory and files. We need to delete this file tree. We have assigned the parent directory path to Path variable.postVisitDirectory() has been overridden to delete the directory after traversing and deleting the child directory. visitFile() is deleting the file. Both the method is returning FileVisitResult.CONTINUE which means to continue the traversing and deleting.
Following up on our review of Highwood Distiller's Centennial 10 year old rye, we now turn to its albino twin — White Owl Whisky. While both products are a 60/40 blend of wheat and rye, the Centennial is aged a minimum of 10 years, due to its age statement, whereas the White Owl is mostly 10 year old whisky, but a minimum of 8 years. The White Owl blend is then ran through triple filtration to remove color and impurities, leaving you with, yes, a clear whisky. At first glance, you might think you're purchasing a vodka, but the translucent bottle (think the clarity of a Grey Goose bottle, but the shape of an old-fashioned decanter) is clearly labelled as whisky. At first whiff, this is clearly not vodka; but it's not obviously whisky either. Here's our take:
In the glass, the White Owl Whisky has the look of vodka, with light legs and a slight viscosity to it. The nose is remarkably clean, with a hint of floral notes. Strangely, this whisky seems to present its real gems of flavour not on the nose, but in the mouth. The first hit to the palate is sweet raisins and pears, with a light butterscotch hiding underneath. Additionally, a hint of anise hits at the start, and lingers through the finish, which is long with a honeycomb sweetness.
While my first impressions of this whisky were biased by preconceptions that it would be a true Canadian rye, but without color, when I came back to it a week or two later, I was amazed by how pleasant this whisky is. While it doesn't have the complexity to keep me interested as a regular dram to drink neat, where I feel it will excel is as a mix. Try substituting White Owl Whisky for vodka in a dry martini. Or, test the effects of replacing the bourbon in a Manhattan or Old Fashioned. The subtle characteristics which set this whisky apart from other whiskies, as well as vodkas, makes this a creation addition to the aspiring mixologist's bar.
Lastly, here's a Q&A from Highwood, describing the product, and hopefully clarifying what we haven't.
How old is the whisky aged?
We use mostly 10 year old wheat grain and less mature rye grain for more of a bite and taste.
Why is it clear?
We triple filter it to remove the color, like high-end vodkas and remove all impurities, and indigestible alcohols. We can't give exact production information as the process and recipe is priority.
What are the benefits of clear whisky?
It is more mixable! As well as your favorite whisky mix you can now be creative and make Martinis (Apple White Whisky), Screwdrivers, Caesars, or cranberry juice are some of the many mixes you can enjoy. The taste is also cleaner, crisp, & a smoother taste with filtering.
It doesn't smell like whisky?
What you smell in all whiskies is the flavoring that is allowed to be added to make whiskies palatable. By law you can add up to 9.09% additives & flavorings. Some of the most common additives are caramel coloring/flavoring, artificial flavors, sherry, and/or brandy. To White Owl we add none of these. The taste therefore is a softer rye flavor and smoother than premium vodka thanks to the 10 years of aging and filtering.
Its moonshine?
No, moonshine is not aged or filtered and contains many impurities.
I am/know people who can't drink rye?
They can drink ours as with triple filtering – “we clean the evil out”. This also helps in reducing the occurrence of hangovers.
What can I mix it with it?
Enjoy it as you normally like your rye cocktails, but now with White Whisky the drinks options are limitless.
It is expensive?
Not expensive at all as it is cheaper than most high-end vodkas that are not even aged. White Owl is distilled from the finest Canadian grains, then aged for 10 years and finally triple filtered for smoothness. No premium vodkas are aged and no premium ryes are filtered so in comparison it is a great value compared to other premium spirits.
Bernie Sanders held a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Sunday to mark one year since launching their presidential bid, vowing to take their fight for the Democratic nomination to the superdelegates currently supporting frontrunner Hillary Clinton.
“It's a tough road to climb,” Sanders told reporters at the National Press Club, but “not an impossible” one.
In a scene reminiscent of the sparsely attended, April 30, 2015, press conference on Capitol Hill where they formally announced their run, the Vermont senator said that those superdelegates supporting the former secretary of state ought to rethink their pledge — particularly in states where they won handily.
“I would ask the superdelegates to respect the wishes of the people of those states,” Sanders said.
Overall, Clinton has the support of 520 superdelegates, while Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, has “all of 39” — despite winning 17 primaries and caucuses “in every part of the country.”
Sanders pointed out that although they won Washington state's Democratic caucuses by 46 points (73 percent to 27 percent) and 25 of the state's 36 pledged delegates, Clinton has the support of 10 of Washington's Democratic unpledged superdelegates.
“We have zero,” they said. “Obviously, we are taking on the entire Democratic establishment.”

Clinton's lead over Sanders in pledged delegates is 1,645 to 1,318.
“Let's be clear,” Sanders said. “It is virtually impossible for Secretary Clinton to reach the majority of convention delegates by June 14 — the end of the primary season — with pledged delegates alone. They will need superdelegates to take them over the top at the convention in Philadelphia. In other words, it will be a contested convention.”
They urged the superdelegates to consider which Democratic candidate would have the best chance of winning in November. And “based on virtually every national and state poll over the last several months,” Sanders said, that would be him.
“I would be the stronger candidate,” they said, noting that it “would be a disaster if Donald Trump or some other rightwing Republican were to become president of the United States.”

Permafrost is permanently frozen soil, and occurs mostly in high latitudes. Permafrost comprises 24% of the land in the Northern Hemisphere, and stores massive amounts of carbon. As a result of climate change, permafrost is at risk of melting, releasing the stored carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and methane, which are powerful heat-trapping gases. In addition, permafrost is structurally important, and its melting has been known to cause erosion, disappearance of lakes, landslides, and ground subsidence. It will also cause changes in plant species composition at high latitudes.

The Effect of Climate Change on Permafrost
Permafrost is soil that has been frozen year round for at least two years. Permafrost comprises 24% of Northern Hemisphere land (Figure 1), and is also found, to a lesser extent, in the Southern Hemisphere. The upper layer of permafrost, or the active layer, sometimes thaws in the summer. Recently, the active layer of permafrost has been observed to be getting larger with time, which means more permafrost is melting each summer. This is not unexpected—the high latitudes are expected to warm much more than low latitudes as the atmosphere continues to warm (Figure 2).
Climate change is expected to significantly affect above and below-ground climate. Although widespread changes to permafrost usually take centuries, the IPCC estimates that by the mid-21st century, the area of permafrost in the northern hemisphere will decline by 20-35%. Additionally, the United Nations Environmental Programme suggests the depth of thawing could increase by 30-50% by the year 2080.
Recent studies have shown that there has been a decrease in freezing during the cold season in North America's permafrost regions. Coastal areas and eastern Canada have started to see significant increases in warm season thawing of permafrost. This means there has been a decrease in freeze depths and in the amount of permafrost, and an increase in the area of the active layer. The increase in the active layer doesn't mean there's more ground being frozen, it means more permafrost is melting seasonally, losing its distinction as "permanent." Permafrost is not only affected by climate change, but eventually will affect climate change itself by releasing the greenhouse gases it stores.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Permafrost stores an immense amount of carbon and methane (twice as much carbon as contained in the atmosphere). In a warming environment, permafrost is expected to degrade, and these gases which have been in storage will be released. This process has already begun in some parts of the world, including western Siberia, and is expected to increase in earnest by the year 2020. Furthermore, as of 2011, no climate model incorporates the effects of methane released from melting permafrost, suggesting that even the most extreme climate scenarios in the models might not be extreme enough.
Carbon
A third of the Earth's soil carbon is found in the Arctic tundra soil, stored in frozen organic matter. If the high northern latitudes warm significantly (as they are expected to; see Figure 3), permafrost will thaw, allowing the organic matter within the permafrost to decompose. The decomposition will release carbon into the atmosphere. This already happens within the active layer each summer. As the active layer thaws, some organic matter decomposes. Under normal climate conditions (i.e. a cold arctic region), the ground remains cold enough to keep the decomposition very slow. But as air temperature increases and the ground warms, this process will speed up, and scientists think this could begin very soon. Some suggest the arctic tundra could go from being a carbon sink to a carbon source by the mid-2020s.
Researchers at the National Snow and Ice Data Center estimates that by 2200, 60% of the Northern Hemisphere's permafrost will probably be melted, which could release around 190 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. This amount is about half of all the carbon released in the industrial age. The effect this will have on the rate of atmospheric warming could be irreversible. At the very least, these estimates mean fossil fuel emissions will have to be reduced more than currently suggested accounting for the amount of carbon expected to discharge from melting permafrost.
Peatlands are also expected to be impacted by global climate change. Peat is made up of dead organic material, and so is very rich in carbon. It consists of 90% water and 10% plant matter, and is mostly found at the high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, both at the surface and below. Some of this peat is found underneath the permafrost layer, which means the carbon it harbors could be in jeopardy should the permafrost melt. In a study of the world's peatlands, one recent study found that if the globe warms 1°C over the next few decades, this could lead to a release of 38-100 million tons of carbon per year from peat alone.
Methane
In moist areas, most of the emissions will be of methane, a greenhouse gas that has 20 to 25 times more warming power than carbon dioxide. As the ground warms, methane will either be released directly into the atmosphere or bacteria will break it down into carbon dioxide, which will then be released. If areas of thawed permafrost exist at depth between frozen layers, it's possible that microbial activities will continue unabated, even during the winter, to create new methane from organic material.
This is what is believed to be happening around Siberia's lakes. In 2006, researchers working at two northern Siberian lakes found that methane was bubbling up from thawing permafrost at a rate five times faster than originally thought. The study also found an expansion of "thaw lakes" in the permafrost regions. Studies conducted in Canadian and Swedish permafrost and peatland regions also show these trends.
Methane hydrates can be thought of as methane gas frozen into ice structures, like the one in Figure 5. They're formed at cold temperatures and under high pressure—conditions that are both present beneath layers of frozen permafrost. The amount of methane hydrates in permafrost could range anywhere from 7.5 to 400 billion tons of carbon-equivalent.
Methane hydrates are abundantly present in and near the Siberian Ice Complex, or Arctic Shelf, which provides a shelf-like structure to support the land and coastline on top of it. As waters along the northern coast warm, the ice complex melts, allowing for quick erosion compared to the historical rate. In these areas, the water contains 2500% of the methane found in average atmospheric conditions. And recent research shows the amount of methane currently being released from the Arctic Shelf region is around the same amount of methane being released from all the oceans in the world. This is particularly dangerous because of the Shelf's shallow depth. In other regions where methane hydrates exist, they are deep enough to oxidize to carbon dioxide before reaching the surface. In this region, the methane is released directly into the air.

The Disaster Scenario
It's not hard to imagine a disaster scenario surrounding permafrost. As the atmosphere warms, permafrost melts, which releases greenhouse gas, which further warms the atmosphere, which speeds up the permafrost melting, and so on. Currently, climate models do not incorporate the effects of methane released from melting permafrost, which means even the most extreme warming scenarios we've come up with might not be extreme enough. A spike in atmospheric methane concentration could set off catastrophic global warming.
David Shindell and Gavin Schmidt (climate scientists of RealClimate) suggest that a real-world disaster scenario would be an instantaneous release of about 10 gigatons carbon-equivalent (gton C) of methane into the atmosphere. Right now, it contains approximately 3.5 gton C of methane.
They don't see any way to get more than 1 gton C as methane into the air emitted at one time, fortunately, but the world has seen a massive release of methane in the past: the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Studies focusing on this time period estimate that several thousand gton C of methane were released into the atmosphere. But, although it's hard to accurately conclude how long it took for this to happen, current estimates are around a thousand years. In other words, it wasn't immediate. But the warming that is occurring due to anthropogenic climate change is unprecedented in its rate—the world is warming ten times faster today that in did in the PETM. For this reason, it's hard to rule out any disaster global warming scenario.

But to have any chance of blocking Trump's nominees, Democratic leaders would need to keep their caucus unified — and there are early signs that some members won't be willing to hold the line.
Red-state Democrats running in 2018 aren't closing the door on supporting Trump's picks. They're avoiding critical statements that could box them in when the nominations come to the floor for votes next year.
Manchin has already announced their support for Sessions — whom other Democrats have balked at because of decades-old allegations that they made racist comments — and pledged to keep an open mind on other nominees.
“They'll be coming to my office and I'll ask the questions that are important to me, but I haven't formed an opinion on them. I've been receptive,” Manchin said.
“I could read a lot about stuff that would give me heartburn, but we're going to bring them in, we're going to visit with them and give them an honest shake,” they said.
Schumer on Tuesday trained their fire on Price, who authored a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and has championed Medicare reforms that Democrats call privatization.
“There are a whole number of Republicans who are not going to be for privatizing Medicare, and there ought to be bipartisan support against a secretary [who] was going to privatize Medicare and not fund Planned Parenthood,” Schumer told reporters.
Schumer says they will not vote for Sessions to be attorney general unless they are convinced that they would establish a strong civil rights division at the Justice Department.
But vulnerable Democrats aren't marching to the fight in lockstep with their leadership.
When asked about Price, Tester said, “I know who they are, but I don't know what they are, so I've got to sit down” with him.
Tester said they know Sessions but not well enough to be familiar with their lengthy record as a senator, former state attorney general and former U.S. attorney.
When asked about DeVos, a major GOP donor and champion of school vouchers who has drawn early opposition from teachers unions, Tester expressed some reservation but said he's persuadable.
“I'm a former teacher, school board member. I think it's important to have someone who's really familiar with the classroom like a teacher, but I'll give them their due,” they said. “We'll give everybody a fair shake.”
Schumer on Tuesday accused Republicans of “plotting a war on seniors next year,” citing Price's selection.
But Democrats running for reelection in states that Trump won say they're going to make up their own minds on the subject.
“I don't know him,” they said. “I'm going to wait until the hearings.”
Nelson is up for reelection in Florida, a state Trump won narrowly.
Still, some of the Democrats up for reelection in 2018 appear eager for a fight over at least some of the Cabinet appointments.
“Tom Price has led the charge to privatize Medicare, and for this reason, I cannot support their nomination,” Donnelly said in a statement. “[T]he nomination of Tom Price would put us on a direct path to end Medicare as we know it.”
“I cannot imagine supporting a candidate for one of the most important jobs in the government who has advocated for Medicare privatization and for total repeal of the Affordable Care Act,” they said.
But Brown has also signaled they want to support some of Trump's picks, telling an Ohio radio station last week that they would vote for Mitt Romney to serve as secretary of State, if they were nominated.
“All of us are looking at every nominee and I think looking to do a lot of thinking but at the end of the day, we're the ones that changed the rules to allow a president to get a Cabinet with 51 votes,” they said. “Other than pointing out flaws, it will be very difficult to defeat any of them.”
McCaskill, who survived an election scare in 2012, said she's not going to take early positions on any of Trump's personnel choices until they name all of their Cabinet selections.
They warned, however, that they would certainly vote against Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, whose name has been floated to serve as secretary of Homeland Security.
“I'm familiar with their background. Most of the immigration laws that have been struck down by courts were written by him,” they said.
Trump won Missouri with 57 percent of the vote.
“I like to give people a chance to actually come in and visit with me,” they said.
But like Tester, they said DeVos's selection raises a red flag.
“I'm really concerned on education on whether there's a commitment to public education,” they said. “I'm the product of a public school education and I think it's a cornerstone piece that has made America great.”
Democrats from traditionally blue states have been much more vocal in their criticism of Trump's Cabinet picks.
“I think there are a lot of concerns, a lot of concerns,” said Sen. Debbie ­Stabenow (D-Mich.).
Incoming Senate Democratic Leader(N.Y.) has pledged a “very thorough and tough vetting” of Sessions and claimed Tuesday that Price might not make it through the Senate because of their views on privatizing Medicare.
Covering issues from Europe to terrorism and IT, the lesser known Bilderberg policy conference includes prime ministers, CEOs from banks, airlines, oil and the arms industry, and even George Osborne
As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page.
No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing “European strategy” with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year they will be showing off their post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list: “former shadow chancellor of the exchequer.

Europe's hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it's good to know Benoît Coeuré, a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in the strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC.
The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone's favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year's conference. HSBC in particular by its chairperson, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands.
Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairperson of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation's largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world's third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa.
From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairperson of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they're hard to classify. Although “gigantic” goes some way towards it.
It's a heady step up into the big league for Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair. He'll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders.
Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world's biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it.
As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it's likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.
Bilderberg at 60: inside the world's most secretive conference Read more
Finally, it's worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company's executive chairperson, Eric Schmidt, is on the group's steering committee; he'll be joined in Austria by their vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as they continue their quest to merge with computers. But that's another story.
For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world's press. And by “sure to be”, I mean probably won't be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.
These fruit spring rolls with strawberries, kiwi, blueberries, and mango are the perfect dessert for hot summer days. I like them best with strawberry dipping sauce or chocolate sauce! They're super healthy, 100 % vegan, gluten-free, and you don't need any additional sugar. So yummy and easy!
Okay, I LOVE summer rolls. I just love how light and healthy they are, which makes them absolutely perfect for summer. I mean duh! They're called SUMMER rolls. Haha! My vegan summer rolls with mango, mint, and peanut dipping sauce went absolutely crazy on Pinterest in the last couple of weeks. They're one of the most popular recipes on the blog right now. And I think this is well deserved. They're so DELICIOUS and super easy to make! We usually make these savory summer rolls about once or even twice a month. Sometimes I add smoked tofu or even BBQ tempeh. I guess it all depends on my mood or actually what's in our fridge.
Fruit Spring Rolls – What You'll Need
So last week I thought why not try sweet summer rolls?! I mean they'd make a great and easy vegan summer dessert. So I ended up with these fruit spring rolls with tons of fresh fruits and a strawberry dipping sauce instead of our usual peanut sauce. And boy, were they good!
I got a little crazy with the fruits! For the vegan fruit spring rolls you can see in the pictures I used:
kiwi
strawberries
blueberries
cherries
raspberries
oranges
mango
peach
star fruit
passion fruit
and mint
But of course you can use any fruits you like or even use less fruits than I did! Just get creative… They're also amazing with chocolate sauce!!
Just cut everything up and roll it into rice paper rolls. That's it! It's really super easy…
And don't they look amazing? I used a star-shaped cutter for the mango to make them even prettier. I don't have kids yet, but I imagine this would be so much fun making with young children! WE even had lots of fun making them! I was at my parent's house sitting their dog when I made them together with my brother.
Let me know if you give them a try. I always love seeing your Vegan Heaven creations on Instagram and reading your comments on the blog!
Have a great start into the new week, everyone!

aryeastark: Emma Watson's tweet about leaked pictures x it's nice to see them speaking out about this but the empathy thing is gross and ableist. empathy =/= concern or a sense of morality. :/
The thing is, “empathy” can mean multiple things. People are rarely clear about which they are using, and this causes general confusion and a lot of harm to autistic people.
It can mean being able to work out what someone else is thinking (this is generally the meaning in scientific contexts, and is called cognitive empathy)(it also fails across basically any brain, cultural or other difference, people are shit at figuring out what neurodivergent people and foreign people are thinking)
It can mean feeling an emotion because someone around you does (this is called emotional contagion, or affective empathy)
^Those two are the two that some disabled people have difficulties with.
And it can also mean giving a fuck about other people's feelings. When people use it colloquially, they usually use it as a synonym for sympathy. This is a valid use of the word, contextually correct, and it generally doesn't mean the first two meanings at all.
Emotional contagion would actually be really odd (in the sense that Emma watson is clearly using here, i.e. consideration for other people's feelings) in some situations, there's a line between understanding that Jennifer Lawrence is probably feeling violated and humiliated, and actually feeling those things because they are. And that's a different thing to caring that they feel those things.
TL:DR: The word empathy has many possible meanings, some of which would be ableist in this context, but the usage is pretty clear, and I don't think its ableist.
Empathy can mean concern or a sense of morality.
The NSA did not just tap German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone but also listened in on finance, economy, agriculture and other ministers
The United States did not just tap chancellor Angela Merkel's phone but also eavesdropped on several of their ministers, the German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung has reported, citing documents from WikiLeaks.
German-US relations were badly strained after fugitive US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed widespread US foreign surveillance, although a probe into the alleged tapping of Merkel's mobile phone was dropped in June over a lack of evidence.
But according to the latest revelations the US National Security Agency did not limit its snooping activities to Merkel and showed particular interest in the activities of the ministries of finance, economy and agriculture, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported.
It said WikiLeaks had shown it a list of 69 phone numbers belonging to ministers and senior officials that were reportedly targeted. The list appears to date back to between 2010 and 2012.
The current economy minister and vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel, was among those spied on by the NSA, the report said, although it noted they had been in the opposition at the time.
The list also features the number of former finance minister Oskar Lafontaine, who left the job in 1999. But the number was “still active” according to Sueddeutsche Zeitung, ringing through to the secretariat of the current finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble.
While Snowden alleged US spying on many European governments, their disclosures triggered particular anger in Germany where bitterness lingers over mass state spying on citizens by the Stasi secret police in former communist East Germany where Merkel grew up.
Merkel themselves phoned the US president, Barack Obama, over the revelations and in public told Germany's traditional post-war ally and Nato partner that “spying between friends just isn't on”.
Washington appeared to confirm their phone had previously been tapped when US officials said the cellphone was “no longer” a target.
There's a big rivalry between DC Comics and Marvel fans online, but no such rivalry exists between the presidents of the two movie studios.

DC Films president Geoff Johns and Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige worked their way up through Hollywood together, both working for Superman: The Movie director Richard Donner. If fact, the two shared the stage together at an event honoring Donner last week.
“There's not really a rivalry. The rivalry is much more amongst the press, I think,” Feige explained in a live Facebook interview with AlloCiné.
“Geoff Johns is a very good friend of mine. We grew up together in the business and recently celebrated Richard Donner, who we both used to work for,” they continued. “So, I applaud all the success they have. I really just look at it as a fan. When the movies perform well and are well received, it's good for us – which is why I'm always rooting for them.”
Feige also praised the success of Wonder Woman, and mentioned the female lead movies that Marvel is working on. You can check out Feige's comments for yourself in the video below. The Wonder Woman talk is at the 6:50 mark and their comments about DC movies is at 23:27.

Stuart Daniel Baker (born November 7, 1954), better known by their stage name, Unknown Hinson, is an American singer, musician, songwriter, comedian, actor and voice actor.  They are perhaps best known for their role as the voice of Early Cuyler on the Adult Swim animated series Squidbillies.[2][3]
Origins [ edit ]
Stuart Daniel Baker, a music teacher and studio musician from Albemarle, North Carolina, created their alter-ego for The Wild Wild South, a Charlotte area public-access program that featured comedy sketches and concert footage. Baker and co-star Don Swan played the characters of Unknown Hinson and Rebel Helms, respectively. After Swan's death in 1995, Baker created The Unknown Hinson Show, a direct spin-off of The Wild Wild South. The Unknown Hinson Show won Creative Loafing Charlotte's "Best Of" poll for Best Public-Access Television Show four years in a row.[4] After the series ended, Baker continued in their role as Unknown Hinson, performing live concerts and releasing several recordings.
Music [ edit ]
Live performer [ edit ]
As a live performer, Unknown Hinson has been known to tour for months at a time.[citation needed] Hinson is known to always fire their signature gun on the up swing, a true mark of their skill. They have shared the stage with much notable rockabilly, country, and psychobilly acts such as The Reverend Horton Heat, Marty Stuart, Hank III and Ed King.[citation needed] They have a strong cult following and many high-profile fans,[citation needed] including Ed King, Waylon Reavis of Mushroomhead, Billy Bob Thornton, and Matt Groening.[citation needed] Hank III, grandson of Hank Williams, has Unknown's face tattooed on their biceps.[5] In late 2008, working under their real name of Stuart Baker, Hinson was hired to play bass as well as lead guitar in Billy Bob Thornton's band The Boxmasters. For this hired-gun gig, Baker appears without the familiar Unknown Hinson wardrobe and makeup, instead appearing in a vintage '60s suit, white shirt, and black pencil tie. Their manager and booking agent was their wife, Margo Baker (b. 1952, d. 2013).[6][7]
According to a November 10, 2012, post on their Facebook page, Unknown decided to quit touring after 17 years. Their planned last three shows were Fort Wayne, Indiana on November 15, Evanston, Illinois on November 16, and November 17 in Covington, Kentucky being the finale. They cited rising costs and indicated their plans to find something new to do. After the death of their wife, Margo Baker, Unknown Hinson resumed touring again.[8]
Recording artist [ edit ]
Unknown Hinson writes their own music, performs live, and produces all of their own recordings.[citation needed] Their music often parodies the dark elements of today's country and redneck culture. In early 2009, Hinson's 'Torture Town' won in The 8th Annual Independent Music Awards and Vox Pop vote for Best Alternative Country Song "Torture Town".[citation needed]

Democrats took to the Sunday shows to attack Mitt Romney's foreign financial dealings, drawing attention to the Republican candidate's Swiss bank account to try to promote their wealthy, out-of-touch business person persona.
In appearances on “Fox News Sunday” and CNN's “State of the Union,” Democratic National Committee chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs both demanded that Romney release years of tax returns so the American people can see where their assets lie.

“I'd really like to see Mitt Romney release more than one year of tax records because there's been disturbing reports recently that he's got a … secretive Bermuda corporation that no one knows anything about, investment in the Caymans … He's got a Swiss bank account,” Wasserman Schultz said.
The Florida member of congress added: “Americans need to ask themselves: Why does an American business person need a Swiss bank account and secretive investments like that?”
Gibbs, the president's former press secretary, went as far as to say there isn't enough information to rule out whether the former Massachusetts governor has ever done anything illegal, suggesting that it's possible that Romney may have skirted taxes.
“The one thing they can do, Candy, to clear up whether or not he's done anything illegally, whether he's shielding their income from taxes in Bermuda or Switzerland, is to do whatever other presidential candidate has done and that's to release a series of years of their own tax returns,” they told host Candy Crowley. “The best way to see if Mitt Romney is complying with America tax law is to have them release more of their tax returns.”
Gibbs also mocked their choice of banks: “I pick a bank because there's an ATM near my home,” they said.
Meanwhile, Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana faced off on the issue on ABC's “This Week,” with each surrogate trying to push forward their respective campaign's talking points.
O'Malley, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, suggested that Romney's Swiss account is fundamentally un-American.
“I've never known of a Swiss bank account to build an American bridge, a Swiss bank account to create American jobs, or Swiss bank accounts to rebuild the levies to protect the people of New Orleans. That's not an economic strategy for moving our country forward,” the Maryland governor said.
Jindal, who appeared alongside O'Malley, seemed to struggle with the question of how voters should view Romney's offshore investments.
The Louisiana governor — fresh off of the campaign trail where they stumped for Romney in Ohio and Pennsylvania this week — repeatedly dodged substitute host Terry Moran's questions about the candidate's Swiss bank account, before finally writing off the issue as “distractions” promoted by the Obama camp.
Romney campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul said in a statement that the Obama camp has launched an “unfounded character assault” on the candidate, calling it “unseemly and disgusting.”
“Mitt Romney had a successful career in the private sector, pays every dime of taxes they owe, has given generously to charitable organizations, and served numerous causes greater than himself,” Saul said. “Barack Obama has become what they once ran against – a typical politician willing to use false and dishonest attacks to save their job after failing to do their job. The American people expected more from this president, and they continue to let them down.”
Recent reports from Vanity Fair and the Associated Press have raised questions about Romney's blind trusts and offshore holdings — articles that the Obama campaign have seized on to question whether it's right for a presidential candidate to invest outside of the country. The Romney campaign has pushed back on the issue by dismissing it as the Obama camp's effort to distract from the country's weak economy.

Curecoin launch as of now is going to be delayed. Plans to work with Pande Labs at Stanford university will soon be discussed between Pande Labs team and Curecoin devs!
I will post on update asap when I get more news.
Network security from hashing is good. Making money is great. Curing Cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, preventing viruses, and designing next-level pharmaceuticals is awesome. What if we could put these together, to build a coin secured and run by crypto, mined with SHA256, and supported by cancer-curing research?
Announcing Curecoin!
What benefits does it provide?
Most currencies are either in the CPU/GPU stage, or in the ASIC stage. CureCoin can be earned with both. Folders use high-end GPUs and CPUs to fold proteins, earning a proportional portion of coins set-aside automatically by the minting process for their contributions. Miners mine with SHA256 ASICs as usual, securing the blockchain for the CureCoin network. Whether you are heavily-invested in ASIC equipment or still have GPUs and CPUs, you can participate. Due to the nature of folding (diverse, constantly changing, not easily predictable), GPUs and CPUs will both always be relevant, so an investment in consumer hardware isn't wasted.
How is it different?
CureCoin allows owners of both ASIC and GPU/CPU hardware to earn. CureCoin puts ASICs to work at what they are good at--securing a blockchain, while it puts GPUs and CPUs to work with work items that can only be done on them--protein folding. While still having a secure blockchain, it supports, and thus is supported by, scientific research. While it isn't technically 'backed' by scientific research (there's no central authority you can visit to trade coins for scientific research) the coin has intrinsic value as both a currency and as a system of purchasing a tradeable representation of medical research. Similar to the idea of carbon offsets, someone with money can buy some CureCoins which represent a proportional amount of scientific/medicinal research, while someone with tech know-how can also contribute to the folding effort, doing the hands-on work, and gain profit. The value imbued into each unit of the currency from the folding network it represents would add additional traction and inertia to the coin's trading value. As time goes on and the amount of folding done for the network increases, the amount of research that each coin represents grows.
How does the network maintain balance?
Since the daily total from network output from both mining and folding are the same, an increase in miners will subsequently raise the scarcity of the currency (per capita), resulting in folding becoming even more profitable and in-demand. Vice-versa, an increase in folding power will likewise indirectly cause a delayed increase in the network security. Pegging the reward of each type of work to a constant value allows the change to hit a brick wall in changing the currency distribution, which causes other parts of the equation to expand--mining/network security, and folding/coin value. This value in medical research and network security both act to influence the USD/CUR trading value. As the folding and hashing efforts grow, the currency becomes more scarce per capita, creating a general increasing trend of monetary value. Just like any other crypto, CureCoin is a currency, but in this case, one that has more adding to its value than cryptographic security.
Is CureCoin limited to only protein-folding?
No! As the network evolves, additional scientific computing projects can be easily added, in which case the folding reward would become a scientific-computation reward, and would be split fairly between various projects (including CPU-only ones!), and could be done so in either a way to encourage people to balance the projects, or in such a way that people can do whatever project they wish, and receive the same or very similar profits.
What are the details?
Mining: 32 coins per block (start)
1 block per minute
Block-halving every 1,051,200 blocks (for an increase in value)
Folding: 32 coins per minute (start)
Reward-halving every 1,051,200 blocks
Rewards processed on a daily basis, based on points earned
How does this benefit someone with GPU/CPU power?
Rather than mining alt currencies with a (in comparison to ASIC and FPGA equipment) very inefficient hash-generator which uses large amounts of electricity, you can do protein folding (which uses less electricity), earn great returns, contribute to a variety of great computational scientific research, and decrease the wear-and-tear on your precious hardware. Indirectly, you also cause increases in ASIC mining power through network rebalancing. Additionally, NVidia cards are great at folding!
How does this benefit someone with ASIC power?
As someone with ASIC mining power, you can help increase the network security of CureCoin, earn good money from your work (through the proof-of-work block reward of CureCoin), and indirectly support folding efforts through network rebalancing.
How does this benefit an investor or speculator?
If you are going to invest in a crypto, CureCoin is a great choice, as it has more intrinsic value than any other alternate currency based on its pseudo-backing (support) from computational scientific research, and allows you to profit by supporting life-saving computational research. Due to CureCoin's mission, CureCoin will grow quickly, and will likely attract positive media attention.
How is the currency divided up?
CureCoins go to three main areas: Folders, Miners, and Developers. The folders and miners both get 45% of the coins in the network. The other 10% is dedicated to CureCoin developers, and will be used for paying for development costs (such as hiring professional programmers, paying for infrastructure, etc.), and for giving back to the community (folding hardware giveaways, faucets, covering 0% mining pools, etc.).
We will have a team of at least 3 people standing by for tech support if you need help folding for the first time.
Current folding support members include experienced folders including Vorksholk, Yeltz, and myself, CygnusXI.

A massive database of Mexican voter records was made publicly accessible on the internet, a US security researcher has discovered.
The names, addresses, date of birth and voter ID numbers of 87 million Mexicans appeared to be listed in the cache.
It was discovered by Chris Vickery, who had been browsing unsecured databases, with a security tool called Shodan.
The voter data has since been taken offline.
"When I opened it up in my database, viewer I saw names, obvious addresses and identifying numbers. I started Googling the addresses to see where they were," Mr Vickery, a security researcher for software firm MacKeeper, told the BBC.
"All the addresses turned out to be in Mexico. I thought, 'This is a Mexican voter database - it has to be.'"
Image copyright Chris Vickery Image caption Chris Vickery found the database online and notified Mexican authorities
Mr Vickery had made their discovery on 14 April, they said, and initially had trouble reaching an official to warn about the leak.
After mentioning the database during a talk at Harvard last week, a Mexican who happened to be in the audience helped to authenticate the data.
"He was able to authenticate their father's entry in the database - they said, 'Oh my God, that's my address, that's everything,'" said Mr Vickery.
A journalist, also present at the talk, helped Mr Vickery to inform the Mexican National Electoral Institute, which organises federal elections in the country.
The institute has since released a statement in Spanish about the data's publication online.
"A copy of the electoral register has been found in a file storage site of the US company Amazon," it reads.
"An internal investigation has been launched and the case has been reported to the special prosecutor for electoral crimes."
Once the authorities had been notified, steps were taken to remove the information from Amazon's cloud servers. This was done by 22 April.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The database was discovered on a cloud server provided by Amazon Web Services
"All [Amazon Web Services] security features and networks continue to operate as designed," Amazon said in a statement.
"On April 21, AWS was notified that an unsecured database containing sensitive information was being hosted on the AWS cloud and was publicly accessible via the internet.
"We then notified the customer by both email and phone.
"As of 01:00 [local time] on 22 April, this database was no longer publicly accessible."
Mr Vickery said they had since been invited to Mexico as a guest of the government and planned to accept the invitation if their wife was able to join them on the trip.
"The embassy told me I was on the cover of every major Mexican newspaper on Saturday," they said.
"I want to get my hands on one of those newspapers."
Electoral registers
Recently, the details of 70 million voters in the Philippines were reported to have leaked online.
And in December last year, Mr Vickery found a cache of data on 191 million US voters after a database was made accessible via the web.
Speaking on the dangers of this sort of data being made public, Mr Vickery said it could sometimes be used by scammers.
Image copyright AFP Image caption The names, addresses and dates of birth of 87 million Mexicans appeared to be included in the cache
"They call up old people and tell them they have a virus," they said.
The scammers then give the victims instructions that result in malware being installed on their computers.
"It's a huge problem over here," Mr Vickery said.
And in Mexico in particular, they said - where up to 100,000 people are kidnapped every year - data on people's home addresses could be considered particularly sensitive.
Alex Cruz Farmer at security company NSFocus IB said: "This is a significant breach, and what makes it worse is that the data was being held outside of Mexico."
Mr Cruz Farmer said data-governance rules in the country forbade exporting people's personal information outside the country without their permission.
"As Mr Vickery has quite rightly raised, the concern over what the data could be used for is extremely distressing," they added.
A cigar-chomping former communist, Pier Luigi Bersani, will become the centre-left's candidate at the general election in Italy to be held early next year.
With more than 80% of the ballots counted in the final round of a primary election, it was clear Bersani had crushed a challenge from the young mayor of Florence, Matteo Renzi, who had vowed to sweep the old guard from the leadership of Italy's centre-left Democratic party (PD). They led their rival by 61% to 39%.
In a Twitter message soon after conceding , Renzi said: "It was the right thing to try, it was beautiful to do it together. Thank you all from the heart."
With opinion polls suggesting the PD and its allies could win an outright majority in both houses of parliament, the vote on Sunday may also have decided the issue of who will lead Italy after the current, non-party government of Mario Monti runs to the end of its term. In the opening round of the primary on 25 November, more than 3 million people took part.
Next year's general election, which is most likely to be held on 10 March, will be crucial not just for Italy but the rest of the European Union and beyond. The winner will take on the onerous task of steering Italy out of the euro crisis and a recession that is expected to last until at least the end of 2013.
As minister for economic development in the last centre-left government from 2006 to 2008, Bersani masterminded successive rounds of liberalisation aimed at increasing competition and eroding the privileges of some of Italy's many hidden cartels. To improve its chances of success, however, the PD will be fighting the election in an alliance with the more radical left Ecology and Freedom party (SEL). The leader of the SEL, the governor of Puglia, Nichi Vendola, was eliminated in the first round of voting.
The left's primary elections were both divisive and unifying. Renzi repeatedly pledged to send the older members of the PD's leadership "to the scrapyard". But pollsters said that it also won them the support of many on the left of the party and in the SEL, eroding the conventional division between radicals and moderates.
The ballots – and the campaign leading up to them – injected a new vigour and sense of urgency into a centre-left which for years has struggled to best the charismatic, if scandalous, Silvio Berlusconi. Since resigning in November 2011 after losing their parliamentary majority, Berlusconi has repeatedly changed their mind about whether to run in next year's election.
Their indecision has had a devastating effect on the prospects of the Freedom People, the movement they founded. Most recent polls have assigned it around 16% of the vote – less than the Five-Star Movement led by the comedian and blogger Beppe Grillo.
President Trump on Aug. 10 said threats they made to North Korea two days earlier about facing the "fire and fury" of the U.S. "may not be tough enough." (The Washington Post)
The dueling threats issued by President Trump and the North Korean military have prompted questions about U.S. procedures to launch a preemptive nuclear attack. The answer is stark: If the president wants to strike, their senior military advisers have few options but to carry it out or resign.
The arrangement has existed for decades, but is salient after Trump warned Tuesday that future threats by North Korea will be “met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.” Pyongyang responded by saying it is considering a preemptive missile strike against Guam, and Trump doubled down on their remarks Thursday by refusing to take a U.S. preemptive strike off the table and suggesting their comments might not have been tough enough.
“I don't talk about it,” Trump said of a potential preemptive strike. “We'll see what happens.”
[Trump escalates rhetoric on threat from North Korea]
Administration officials, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have sought to ease the tension, while at the time same time warning North Korea that if it carries out an attack, it will be met with a crushing response. But they also have underscored that it is Trump's prerogative to use whatever rhetoric they believe is appropriate as commander in chief.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Aug. 10 that the U.S. response to the threats from North Korea is being "diplomatically led," and they want it to stay that way. "The tragedy of war is well enough known. It doesn't need another characterization beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic." (Reuters)
“I was not elected. The American people elected the president,” Mattis told reporters traveling with them Wednesday to the West Coast. “The rhetoric is up to the president.”
The “fire and fury” controversy has renewed questions among critics about whether Trump has the appropriate temperament to control the U.S. nuclear arsenal. It also follows a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment, first reported Tuesday, that North Korea has successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles.
[North Korea now making missile-ready nuclear weapons, U.S. analysts say]
During their campaign, Trump promised that they would “do everything in my power never to be in a position where we will have to use nuclear power.” But they also repeatedly declined to say whether they would use nuclear weapons first in a conflict. On Thursday, they said they would like to “de-nuke the world,” but that until other countries get rid of their nuclear weapons, “we will be the most powerful nuclear nation in the world, by far.”
A December 2016 assessment by the Congressional Research Service stated that the president “does not need the concurrence of either their military advisors or the U.S. Congress to order the launch of nuclear weapons.” Additionally, the assessment said, “neither the military nor Congress can overrule these orders.”
The reason is simple: The system is set up for the United States to launch an attack within minutes, so that if the United States is under a nuclear attack, it can respond almost instantly, said Bruce Blair, a former nuclear watch officer. Trump would presumably meet with Mattis, White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. and Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the White House national security adviser, before launching a preemptive attack, but it would “really be uncharted territory” if they sought to stall or slow down an order from the president, Blair said.
Under the existing War Powers Act of 1973, the president also is not required to seek congressional approval for any military action until 60 days after the start of a war. Two lawmakers, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), sought to stop the president from launching a first-strike nuclear attack until Congress declares war, but the effort hasn't gone anywhere and is unlikely to with Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress.

Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on nuclear matters at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said that they have mixed feelings about the legislation proposed, but “it would be better than what we have now.” Trump, they said, is a “walking, one-man campaign for ending nuclear deterrence,” the long-held U.S. policy in which the country maintains a robust nuclear arsenal to dissuade other countries from launching a nuclear attack.
But Lewis argued it also would be irresponsible to give any president control of nuclear weapons, but then create a system under which they cannot be used. It would be better, Lewis said, to maintain a small number of nuclear weapons to be used only if attacked.
Steven F. Hayward, a conservative policy scholar, said that if Trump's senior military advisers stood united against carrying out a preemptive nuclear strike, the “real remedy would be resignation.” Hypothetically, doing so might trigger impeachment proceedings, Hayward said, but it isn't clear whether it would be quick enough to stop the president from launching an attack.
“It could happen,” Hayward said. “It would be pretty dramatic and it would be very unclear what would happen, but it could happen. We're really in uncharted waters here.”
Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale University, said that the principle of civilian control of the military also looms large — “even when the civilian in control is as unpredictable and belligerent as President Trump.” Latin American nations have modeled their constitutions along American lines, and their experiences suggest that terrible consequences follow when generals defy their presidents, even under compelling circumstances.
“Worse yet, once the principle is violated, it becomes a precedent for future generals to take the law into their own hands,” Ackerman said. “We cannot allow this dynamic to take hold here. If Trump's team can't convince him, they should obey the orders of their commander in chief.”

Vintage Home Boutique is the passionate project of local couple Maureen and Keith Lobo, who wanted to open their first business together in the neighbourhood they also call home. With Maureen's interest in furniture refinishing and Keith's extensive knowledge of retail, the eco-conscious pair decided to launch their first business â first online a year ago and now in brick and mortar form in the Hillcrest neighbourhood.
We've been collecting for years, and realized now was the time for us to open a store.
Along with their husband Keith, Maureen's the parent of a ten-month-old and a five-year-old. Despite taking over a year to find the right location for their store, using family members' storage spaces and going through two and a half months of renovation and organization, the Lobos' commitment to staying and working in the neighbourhood has been rewarding:
It's a bonus to be able to walk to work in your own community.
Located at 710 St. Clair Avenue West, Vintage Home Boutique occupies 2,300 square feet next door to its landlord, McDonald's Restaurant. The space had been vacant for 15 years and now has been transformed into a welcoming furniture showroom. Featuring locally sourced new and vintage furniture, art, and accessories, Vintage Home Boutique fills a niche in the neighbourhood â a home decor shop with a green conscious for locals wanting to shop for their home in their own backyard.
The roomy light-filled space easily draws in those walking along the street with its colourful window displays and eclectic collection of decors. Shoppers can find high-quality and well-priced vintage pieces, such as mid-century dining tables, chairs, dressers, side tables, and storage units, new custom sofas, sofa beds, and chairs from local manufacturer Brentwood Classics, and a rotating display of local artists, including glass objects from the Windsor-based Tsunami Glass and reclaimed barn-board pieces that can be custom-made.
The Lobos' commitment to living a green life is also integral to their business. Selling quality vintage pieces is a way to reuse and recycle. They're promoting local craftspeople and companies who echo the same beliefs. Brentwood Classics uses North American â sourced wood and soy foam in its furniture, while Maureen Lobo uses non-toxic refinishing products for all the store's vintage pieces. And thanks to Keith's keen eye, there are several distinctive additions for accessorizing a home, such as old-school suitcases, wooden milk crates, cool camera bags, one-of-a-kind ceramic pieces, and pairs of lamps that you won't find in any big-box store.
For shoppers who are smitten with a unique piece in the showroom, there is a seven-day return policy. Every piece is also listed on the store's website to allow a second look at an item or provide inspiration for those wanting to come to the store.
There've been a few pieces that I've been sad to see sold, but it's good to see people appreciating what we're doing, especially since there's nothing like our store on this part of St. Clair West,
says Maureen, who explained that they and their husband did their research on Queen Street West and East, figuring out how to make their store unique among the current retail offerings.
Even though Vintage Home Boutique has been open only a short time, the hot seller has been mid-century platform bed frames â the perfect piece for many of the new condominium residents of the neighbourhood. Several shoppers are also looking for bedroom dressers. For Maureen and Keith, their devotion to quality vintage and well-made design is now shared by all those who come to Vintage Home Boutique.

Encouraged to write letters to service members overseas, Americans heeded the call and sent massive amounts of mail to their loved ones. The U.S. Postal Service was quickly overwhelmed as the volume of correspondance skyrocketed. So in 1942 the government decided to implement Victory Mail, or V-Mail as it was known, which was a version of the British “Airgraph” system. The Smithsonian explains how the British came to develop Airgraph.
Later to become “V-Mail” when adopted by the United States, the Airgraph Service was first developed by the British Post Office in response to the Italians closing of the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea to Allied forces. Seaborne traffic was rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope. This 12,000 mile detours could mean delays of anywhere between three and six months for mail destined for British soldiers stationed in the Middle East and the Far East. Alternatives to the route around the Cape were considered, eventually settling on transport by aircraft-however, space in any aircraft was extremely limited. Microphotography was deemed the best solution to the problem of space.
A person who wanted to send a letter by airgraph or V-Mail would obtain the standard, pre-printed form from the local post office or five and dime store on request. The form contained space for a letter of about 100 to 300 words, the address of the serviceman or -woman to whom the letter was to be delivered, the address of the sender, and a circular area for the censor's stamp of approval. Once the message was written, the form was to be folded and sealed. It then made its way to a processing center where the form was re-opened and fed through a machine that photographed the letters on 16mm film. A continuous roll of this film (100 feet long by 16mm wide) could hold up to 1700 messages and, with the metal container it was housed in, weighed 5.5 oz (154g). A sack of mail holding the same number of regular letters would have weighed 50 lbs. (22.5kg). When the V-Mail reached the destination, it was sent to a local processing facility that reversed the process, printing photographs of the letters to be sent to the intended recipient in a three inch by four inch envelope.
One of the striking things about about the deficit crisis that seems to loom over the United States is the probability that it will force a massive change in American expectations. In Newsweek this week Niall Ferguson beats the deficit drum. Their fear is that US will have to give up its position as superpower:
As interest payments eat into the budget, something has to give—and that something is nearly always defense expenditure. According to the CBO, a significant decline in the relative share of national security in the federal budget is already baked into the cake. On the Pentagon's present plan, defense spending is set to fall from above 4 percent now to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and to 2.6 percent of GDP by 2028. Over the longer run, to my own estimated departure date of 2039, spending on health care rises from 16 percent to 33 percent of GDP (some of the money presumably is going to keep me from expiring even sooner). But spending on everything other than health, Social Security, and interest payments drops from 12 percent to 8.4 percent. This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the resources available for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Which is why voters are right to worry about America's debt crisis.
Ferguson fears the consequences of a withdrawal of American hegemony. But there's a different threat here too. The US has relied on the military to provide economic benefits for a long time.
The military is our secret Keynesian weapon. William Kristol was the first to say that if we needed to spend stimulus money, it should be most quickly and efficiently spent through the Pentagon. It is often overlooked how much we depend on the military to provide jobs, vocational training and government subsidies to industry.
Many have argued that this is a very inefficient way to achieve those economic goals.
But it is the way we've chosen since the Reagan build-up began 30 years ago. Like the massive overhaul in our entitlement programs that will be forced by the deficit spending on financial system bailout, the loss of military Keynesianism will cause great disruption within the American economy.

An Empire at Risk

My script was very, VERY different than what ended up on the screen. My screenplay was darker, grittier and had a very compelling story with rich characters. What my screenplay didn't have was slow motion at every turn, Dutch tilts, campy dialogue, aliens in KISS boots, and everyone wears Bob Marley wigs...
Then I got another batch of notes. I thought it was a joke. They changed the entire tone. I knew these notes would kill the movie. The notes wanted me to lose key scenes, add ridiculous scenes, take out some of the key characters. I asked Mike where they came from. They said, "From us." But when I pressed him, they said, "From John's camp, but we agree with them."
I refused to incorporate the notes into the script and was fired.
2017 could be a historical year for the Detroit Lions. The Lions 2016 campaign ended with a loss in the opening round of the playoffs last season and fourth year head coach Jim Caldwell will be looking to change that. Nobody can tell the future, but here are some bold predictions that could very well happen in 2017.
Lions will have a 1000 yard rusher
Last season wasn't a big rushing year for the Lions, finishing tied for last in rushing attempts and 29th in rushing yards. The team as a whole rushed for only 1310 yards, divided up amongst nine players. The team's best rusher was Theo Riddick who rushed for 357 yards on 92 carries, not really stats to brag about. With the addition of guard TJ Lang and offensive tackle Ricky Wagner the running game will greatly improve. Add Ameer Abdullah to the mix and you've got a dangerous rushing attack. Abdullah's presence alone will transform the backfield. Abdullah is going to be a breakout star this season. Their slick moves combined with their speed and vision will allow them to rush for more 1000 yards in 2017. They will become the Lions first 1000 yard rusher since Reggie Bush in 2013. Not only will they dominante as a rusher, but Abdullah's skill set will allow them to also be a top five back in terms of total offense.
Jarrad Davis will lead the team in tackles
In 2016, middle linebacker Tahir Whitehead was the Lions leading tackler with 132 total tackles. After them there is quite a dropoff. In fact, Safety Tavon Wilson was second with 89. Team's never want defensive backs to be ranked in the top three for tackles. That means plays got past the linebackers. That's where Davis is going to step in.  They are going to bridge that gap, fill that hole and be a Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate. During their time as a Florida Gator Davis was a tackling machine and that will not change in Detroit. With there being little competition for a starting spot Davis will be seeing a majority of the snaps Week 1. They have a knack for finding the ball and uses great form tackling. Those traits are going to allow them to have an immediate impact on the team.  They are a better athlete than Whitehead, and not only will they develop into a better player by the end of the year Davis will have more tackles than them and become the cornerstone of this defense for years to come.
Matthew Stafford will be the league MVP
Stafford wasn't far off last season. Before the finger injury it looked as if they had a legitimate shot at being the league MVP. In 2016 they got a lot of attention for being the comeback kid, in 2017 their story will be different. Stafford will wow voters with game management skills. The biggest difference for Stafford this season is that they have a run game to lean on. This will take the ball out of their hands and not force them to throw upwards of 50 passes a game. The improved offensive line won't just help the run game, but it will give Stafford more time to see plays develop, not have to rush throws and allow them to make better decisions. Expect Stafford's touchdowns to go up, their interceptions to go down, but for the yardage to stay roughly the same.  They are going to lead this team to another winning record and into the playoffs for the third time in their career. Speaking of playoffs…
Lions will win a playoff game
This is the year. It's been said before and it will be said again, but this truly is the year for the Lions to get a playoff win. With Stafford playing at an elite level, Abdullah taking the NFL by storm and Davis leading a stout defense, it's time. The Lions will have a full head of steam entering the playoffs, instead of stumbling in like last year. Caldwell will make the playoffs for the third time in four years and the Lions will make the playoffs in back-to-back seasons, which hasn't happened since ‘94-'95. The team will be able to win on the road and get its first playoff win since 1991. The win will get the monkey off of not only the organizations back, but off of Stafford's back, too. Now, who knows how far they will go after that, but the Lions will get that elusive playoff win.

Printing out concrete has a number of advantages over typical techniques. To start with, it can form any shape, since it's not limited by molds. Further, anything made using the method might be finished a lot quicker, since it doesn't require the construction of formware structures to give shape to concrete. Finally, it's much more environmentally friendly than typical methods, since it only deposits concrete where it's needed and doesn't waste cement. Since cement production is characterized by high carbon dioxide emissions due to the extreme heat it requires, reducing the amount of concrete needed will also reduce the CO2 generated per structure.
If the technique can be refined further to build just about anything we want more quickly, who wouldn't want to use a method that can also help our planet? The researchers still have to create more experimental structures like this, though, and are in fact involved in the 3D printing of five houses that are actually going to be occupied.
Ivan "spaze" Obrezhan of Gambit CS:GO squad is demoted to a substitute position and will be temporarily replaced by Emil "kUcheR" Akhundov, who will represent our organization at the upcoming online tournaments as well as at the LAN finals of Adrenaline Cyber League. After a conclusion of this tournament in Moscow we will decide who will become a fifth member of Gambit CS:GO teams on a permanent basis.
Ivan's attitude towards the training process as well as an abundance of critical errors in official games forced us to take a risk and conduct a roster change shortly prior to the start of an upcoming LAN tournament.
In light of this zeitnot Gambit's management believes that recruiting Emil is our best option, since they have already played together with Mikhail "Dosia" Stolyarov, Rustem "mou" Telepov and Dauren "AdreN" Kystaubayev back on HellRaisers.
In August due to Gambit's unsatisfying results in the first half of 2016 Alexandr "beast” Yakovlev was released from head coaching duties. Their position is temporarily assumed by our analyst, Rustam "TsaGa" Tsagolov.
Gambit CS:GO:
Mikhail "Dosia" Stolyarov
Dauren "AdreN" Kystaubayev
Rustem "mou" Telepov
Dmitry "hooch" Bogdanov - Captain
Emil "kUcheR" Akhundov - Stand-in
Ivan "spaze" Obrezhan - Substitute
Rustam "TsaGa" Tsagolov - Analyst
Hi Friends,
Hope you are all well. This is one the most requested posts on this site. It's pretty much simple to capture video in your Ionic 2 app, save it on your phone and play it back using a couple of plugins.
Let's begin.
A video screencast of this post.
The complete code for this post is available here.
Scaffold out a new application using the ionic-cli.
We are going to use the MediaCapture plugin to capture video using the device camera. To install the plugin use the below command.
ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-media-capture 1 ionic plugin add cordova - plugin - media - capture
Now open up app.module.ts and add the MediaCapture component in providers as shown below.
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'; import { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MyApp } from './app.component'; import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home'; import { MediaCapture } from 'ionic-native'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ MyApp, HomePage ], imports: [ IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp) ], bootstrap: [IonicApp], entryComponents: [ MyApp, HomePage ], providers: [{provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}, MediaCapture] }) export class AppModule {} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import { NgModule , ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core' ; import { IonicApp , IonicModule , IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular' ; import { MyApp } from './app.component' ; import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home' ; import { MediaCapture } from 'ionic-native' ; @ NgModule ( { declarations : [ MyApp , HomePage ] , imports : [ IonicModule . forRoot ( MyApp ) ] , bootstrap : [ IonicApp ] , entryComponents : [ MyApp , HomePage ] , providers : [ { provide : ErrorHandler , useClass : IonicErrorHandler } , MediaCapture ] } ) export class AppModule { }
Open up home.html. Let's add a button to start recording. Add the below content inbetween ion-content tags.
<button ion-button (click)="startrecording()">Start</button> 1 < button ion - button ( click ) = "startrecording()" > Start < / button >
Now open up home.ts file and write the code as shown below.
import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MediaCapture } from 'ionic-native'; @Component({ selector: 'page-home', templateUrl: 'home.html' }) export class HomePage { constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) { } startrecording() { MediaCapture.captureVideo((videodata) => { alert(JSON.stringify(videodata)); }) } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 import { Component } from '@angular/core' ; import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular' ; import { MediaCapture } from 'ionic-native' ; @ Component ( { selector : 'page-home' , templateUrl : 'home.html' } ) export class HomePage { constructor ( public navCtrl : NavController ) { } startrecording ( ) { MediaCapture . captureVideo ( ( videodata ) = > { alert ( JSON . stringify ( videodata ) ) ; } ) } }
Now we could simply click on a button and record video using our app. This will get stored on the phone storage and is persistent.
Now to play this video in our app, we will make use of the Camera plugin. To install the plugin use the below command.
ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-camera 1 ionic plugin add cordova - plugin - camera
Once again open up app.module.ts and modify it as shown below.
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core'; import { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MyApp } from './app.component'; import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home'; import { MediaCapture, Camera } from 'ionic-native'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ MyApp, HomePage ], imports: [ IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp) ], bootstrap: [IonicApp], entryComponents: [ MyApp, HomePage ], providers: [{provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}, MediaCapture, Camera] }) export class AppModule {} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import { NgModule , ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core' ; import { IonicApp , IonicModule , IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular' ; import { MyApp } from './app.component' ; import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home' ; import { MediaCapture , Camera } from 'ionic-native' ; @ NgModule ( { declarations : [ MyApp , HomePage ] , imports : [ IonicModule . forRoot ( MyApp ) ] , bootstrap : [ IonicApp ] , entryComponents : [ MyApp , HomePage ] , providers : [ { provide : ErrorHandler , useClass : IonicErrorHandler } , MediaCapture , Camera ] } ) export class AppModule { }
Open up home.html and modify it as shown below.
<ion-header> <ion-navbar> <ion-title> Ionic Blank </ion-title> </ion-navbar> </ion-header> <ion-content padding> <button ion-button (click)="startrecording()">Start</button> <button ion-button (click)="selectvideo()">Select</button> <video #myvideo height="300" width="300" controls></video> </ion-content> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 < ion - header > < ion - navbar > < ion - title > Ionic Blank < / ion - title > < / ion - navbar > < / ion - header > < ion - content padding > < button ion - button ( click ) = "startrecording()" > Start < / button > < button ion - button ( click ) = "selectvideo()" > Select < / button > < video #myvideo height="300" width="300" controls></video> < / ion - content >
Our video is going to be played in the video element. So let's wire it up in home.ts as shown below.
import { Component, ViewChild } from '@angular/core'; import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular'; import { MediaCapture, Camera } from 'ionic-native'; @Component({ selector: 'page-home', templateUrl: 'home.html' }) export class HomePage { @ViewChild('myvideo') myVideo: any; constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) { } startrecording() { MediaCapture.captureVideo((videodata) => { alert(JSON.stringify(videodata)); }) } selectvideo() { let video = this.myVideo.nativeElement; var options = { sourceType: 2, mediaType: 1 }; Camera.getPicture(options).then((data) => { video.src = data; video.play(); }) } } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 import { Component , ViewChild } from '@angular/core' ; import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular' ; import { MediaCapture , Camera } from 'ionic-native' ; @ Component ( { selector : 'page-home' , templateUrl : 'home.html' } ) export class HomePage { @ ViewChild ( 'myvideo' ) myVideo : any ; constructor ( public navCtrl : NavController ) { } startrecording ( ) { MediaCapture . captureVideo ( ( videodata ) = > { alert ( JSON . stringify ( videodata ) ) ; } ) } selectvideo ( ) { let video = this . myVideo . nativeElement ; var options = { sourceType : 2 , mediaType : 1 } ; Camera . getPicture ( options ) . then ( ( data ) = > { video . src = data ; video . play ( ) ; } ) } }
Run the app in your device. Since we are using a couple of cordova plugins, it won't run on a browser. If everything goes fine you would see a screen with a couple of buttons. Record a video. Click the select button and select the video you just recorded and it will play automatically in the app.
Please watch the video once as I feel I have explained it a bit better in the video. If you found this helpful, kindly share it with someone and help them too.
Thanks for reading guys. Peace..
Toronto's waterfront has come a long way since its days as an industrial hub. Last year's revitalization of Queens Quay was a major step forward in making the harbour more inviting, but that was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the changes in store for this part of the city.
There are numerous corridors throughout Toronto that are in the midst of massive change. Two that immediately come to mind are Yonge and Church streets, which are duelling for the title of most likely to be unrecognizable in a decade, but you would have to add the waterfront to this list.
To the same degree that the Queens Quay revitalization opened up the central portion of Toronto's lakefront, the re-imagining of Ontario Place will prove a major draw to the west. The massive project will be developed in stages, but the first part - a 7.5 acre park - is scheduled to open this fall.
Some of the highlights from the first phase of the project include a waterfront trail, an open air pavilion, and a fire pit. The idea is to make the place all about the lake, something that Ontario Place didn't entirely do given its strong focus on attraction-based entertainment.
Moving to the east, Loblaws redevelopment of its warehouse at Bathurst and Lake Shore could have a significant impact on this stretch the street, which has filled with condos over the last decade, but remains short on amenities. The residential element of this project is obviously huge - over 850 units are planned - but it's the retail that should prove a boon for the area.
The section of Queens Quay between Bathurst and Rees. St. is quite well established at this point. While some existing parking lots could become sites for future development, it would not be on the scale of other projects currently in the works throughout the lakefront corridor. That said, the Under the Gardiner urban park will completely revitalize the neglected space just north of the street.
Toronto's skyline will have a new notch in later this year when 10 York St. is complete. It's not quite on the waterfront, but is in fact wedged between the Gardiner Expressway and one of its off-ramps. The triangular podium already looks fascinating, and at 65 storeys it'll help to push South Core even closer to the water.
Just a short walk to the east is the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal, which is also due for a massive redevelopment that promises to make the now jail-like structure a major showpiece right on the lake. Not only will the terminal itself be a significant architectural addition to the city, but the adjacent grounds should finally live up to the potential of the location at the heart of the waterfront.
The section of Queens Quay that's due for the most profound change, however, is just to the east. The entire stretch of the street from Yonge to Parliament will be transformed in the next decade. Some of this process has already started with places like Sugar Beach, the Corus Building, George Brown's waterfront campus and the Pier 27 condos, but way more is still to come.
Many of the developments in store for the eastern waterfront could be characterized as large-scale, but none so much as 1-7 Yonge St., which could include the tallest building in the country, plus four others of significant stature - one of which would be a revamp of the eyesore that is the Toronto Star Building.
Just a stone's throw away you have the Daniels Waterfront "city of arts" mixed use development on the former site of the Guvernment/Kool Haus. It's due to be completed in 2018 and will feature 60,400 square metres of residential space, 26,000 sq. m. of office space, and 25,000 sq. m. of retail.
Across the street, the Waterfront Innovation Centre will join the cluster of buildings around Sugar Beach. There's no residential element to this building, which should auger well for a future neighbourhood planners would like to see avoid having a disproportionate amount of residential space to other uses.
On the south side of Queens Quay immediately to the east are the side-by-side projects of Aqualina and Aquavista Bayside, both of which will extend the waterfront promenade to the east while adding more restaurants and retail to the lakeside. These condos are better designed than the towers that first grew on the west side of street 20+ years ago, which tended to block access the lake.
And, just in case you thought that Toronto would keep up its record of bland glass condo towers along the waterfront, you have Moshe Safdie's Monde condo project just to the north of these two sister developments that looks about as elegant as residential building come in this city. It's due for completion in the summer of 2018.
Beyond East Bayfront, the picture is a bit less clear. There are major plans for the area in the form of the 3C waterfront development, which promises a huge mixed use addition near the foot of Parliament St. designed by Foster + Partners (who are also behind The One), but the city's initial plans for the eastern Gardiner put a hold on the project.
With a new configuration favoured by city staff, you can expect to hear more about 3C in the near future. Once the Gardiner picture has come into focus, that'll pave the way for even more development in the West Don Lands, including the re-naturalization of the mouth of the Don River. That'll take more than a decade, but there's no sign that changes to Toronto's waterfront will slow down.

Rose McGowan has weighed in on comedian Louis C.K.'s admission that they had engaged in sexual misconduct against multiple women, castigating what they called the “faux-shock” that the industry had expressed over the misconduct.
The actor, who is among the many women who have accused disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, also called out the “code of complicity” they said surrounded the C.K.'s actions.

In a tweet published Friday after the “Louie” star admitted to acting inappropriately, McGowan said that they had “heard stories” about Louis C.K. years ago, despite being “in no way connected to the comedy scene.”
“I heard stories about Louis C.K. two years ago. I'm in no way connected to the comedy scene, and I'd heard of it. Industry faux-shock is such a tired lie,” McGowan wrote. “I send my strength and love to all women hurt by them & the code of complicity.”
C.K. issued a statement Friday, admitting that the accusations of five women, which were published by the New York Times on Thursday, “are true.”

“These stories are true,” C.K. said in a statement. “At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my d— without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your d— isn't a question. It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.”
In the Times article, multiple women accused the comedian of either masturbating in front of them or asking if they could do so.
“He proceeded to take all of their clothes off, and get completely named, and started masturbating,” comedian Dana Min Goodman told the Times of a 2012 incident in Aspen, Colorado.

Since the publication of the Times article, distributor The Orchard chose not to go forward with the release of C.K.'s film “I Love You, Daddy.” HBO pulled the comedian from the lineup of the upcoming “A Night of Too Many Stars” special, and removed their series “Lucky Louis” and their comedy specials from HBO's streaming service. And Netflix has scrapped a forthcoming comedy special by the embattled star.

Governor Cuomo: There Is Foreign Connection to NYC Chelsea Bomb Attack (Video)
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told FOX and Friends this morning there is a foreign connection to the NYC bomb attack on Saturday night.
Cuomo: It was terrorism. We didn't know if there was a foreign connection. I said that we were going to have to wait and see. Maybe there is a group that will claim ownership or we'll find out who was behind it. As the investigation has proceeded as you have reported the investigation is now focusing on one individual and that would suggest by this individual that there is a foreign connection.

Twitter is providing new detail Friday about its efforts to fight ISIS and violent extremism online. In a tweet from the company's "@Policy" team, the social media company said it has stepped up its fight against violent extremism online. Since the middle of 2015, the company said, it has suspended over 125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist attacks — primarily related to support for ISIS.
That's the first time Twitter has revealed the scale of terrorist related activity on its service. The Brookings Institution estimated in a report last year that there were at least 46,000 Twitter accounts used by ISIS supporters. The new figure revealed by Twitter would suggest that either ISIS has drastically increased its presence on the service since that year, or that Twitter has gotten more effective in identifying terrorist accounts.
The company also said that it has increased the size of teams that review reports of terrorist activity on Twitter, and it has reduced its response time to those reports. The company said it looks into accounts similar to the ones reported, and leverages proprietary spam fighting tools to find other potential terrorist accounts. "We have already seen results, including an increase in account suspensions and this type of activity shifting off of Twitter," the company said.

Twitter's announcement follows a controversy over the role of social media in the lives of the apparently ISIS-inspired couple that killed 14 people in an attack in San Bernardino, California, in December. Ultimately, the FBI said that the husband and wife terror team did not post pro-jihad sentiments publicly on social media before the attack, but sent them in private message communications.
Nonetheless, the fact that an attack had taken place refocused the public debate on what government and corporate leaders can do to spot potential threats in advance and stop online recruitment by ISIS.

Liberty and Justice Are Not Irreconcilable
I voted for Gary Johnson (and am a huge fan of Ron Paul), and respect and fully-support the libertarian passions for freedom and free markets.
But I am also a tireless crusader for enforcing the rule of law.
You might assume that these are opposite philosophies. For example, a reader asks:
Your work on the dangers of the American nuclear industry has been really comprehensive, and you have drawn attention to the deception, manipulation, neglect, and willful ignorance of the nuclear industry. For example, I just watched the Al Jazeera video you posted earlier this year (3/12), in which the NRC and the nuclear industry are (rightly) criticized for waiting for harm to happen, instead of preventing it. At the same time, you identify as libertarian, and I believe you supported Gary Johnson in the presidential election.  They are opposed to public regulation of industry and has said that post-harm lawsuits -- for example, in medical contexts -- are sufficient to encourage businesses to self-regulate for public safety. Could you please explain how you reconcile the libertarian position against regulation with your clear recognition that too-loose self-regulation of the nuclear industry imperils the public?
Nuclear Power Would Not Exist In a Free Market
Initially, it is undisputed that nuclear power plants would not exist if operators had to obtain funding and insurance through the free market. Private insurers won't touch nuclear energy. Investors run the other way, because the odds of losing all of their investment are so high.
No private company in the world would operate a nuclear plant unless the government put a very low cap on liability. In many parts of the world, governments cap liability at a mere $13 billion dollars.
This is a little insane, given that “the risk of a nuclear catastrophe … could total trillions of dollars and even bankrupt a country”.
Indeed:
If there was a free market in energy, nuclear power would be over … immediately.
AP notes:
Nuclear power is a viable source for cheap energy only if it goes uninsured. *** Governments that use nuclear energy are torn between the benefit of low-cost electricity and the risk of a nuclear catastrophe, which could total trillions of dollars and even bankrupt a country. *** The cost of a worst-case nuclear accident at a plant in Germany, for example, has been estimated to total as much as €7.6 trillion ($11 trillion), while the mandatory reactor insurance is only €2.5 billion. “The €2.5 billion will be just enough to buy the stamps for the letters of condolence,” said Olav Hohmeyer, an economist at the University of Flensburg who is also a member of the German government's environmental advisory body. The situation in the U.S., Japan, China, France and other countries is similar. *** “Around the globe, nuclear risks — be it damages to power plants or the liability risks resulting from radiation accidents — are covered by the state. The private insurance industry is barely liable,” said Torsten Jeworrek, a board member at Munich Re, one of the world's biggest reinsurance companies. *** In financial terms, nuclear incidents can be so devastating that the cost of full insurance would be so high as to make nuclear energy more expensive than fossil fuels. *** Ultimately, the decision to keep insurance on nuclear plants to a minimum is a way of supporting the industry. “Capping the insurance was a clear decision to provide a non-negligible subsidy to the technology,” Klaus Toepfer, a former German environment minister and longtime head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), said.
U.S. News and World Report reports:
The disaster insurance for nuclear power plants in the United States is currently underwritten by the federal government, Cooper says. Without that safeguard, “nuclear power is neither affordable nor worth the risk. If the owners and operators of nuclear reactors had to face the full liability of a Fukushima-style nuclear accident or go head-to-head with alternatives in a truly competitive marketplace, unfettered by subsidies, no one would have built a nuclear reactor in the past, no one would build one today, and anyone who owns a reactor would exit the nuclear business as quickly as possible.”
See this and this.
In other words, this is not a free market. Instead, the public has funded the nuclear industry. As such, we - the owners - should get some control over how nuclear plants operate.
Likewise, the government created the mega-banks, big oil and the other mega-corporations.
Free Market Champions Demand Prosecution of Fraud
A strong rule of law is the main determinant of prosperity. On the other hand, failure to prosecute fraud is destroying our prosperity.
Nuclear meltdowns, the financial crisis and the Gulf oil spill all happened for the same reason: fraud to make a few more pennies, and a subsequent cover-up to try to protect the wrongdoers and continue "business as usual". And see this.
This is not free market economics.
Indeed, the father of free market economics - Adam Smith - leading Austrian economists, and other free market advocates are for the prosecution of fraud:
The Real Problem ...
While liberals tend to distrust big corporations and conservatives tend to distrust the federal government, it is really the malignant, symbiotic relationship between the two is the root problem.
Too much government overreach? Giant unaccountable corporations?
Maybe ... but the root problem is that corrupt government officials and corrupt corporate fatcats have merged into a crime syndicate.
Do you get it? Before we can have a real free market, we need to burst the bubble of fraud.
Before we can have a functioning government, we need to stand up to corrupt government officials.
We all need to step out of the left-right dichotomy which is distracting us and dumbing us down.
We need liberty and justice.
The Starcraft 2 build order fraud case, 2904 S.C.2. 2R1F (2014) has been decided after less than 24 hours of deliberation. In an unprecedented move, the StarCraft Supreme Court has ruled against both parties in the case, holding that “everyone involved deserves to lose.”
Plaintiff FrozenImpact originally accused defendant Lillekanin of stealing their two barracks, one factory Terran versus Protoss build order, fraudulently representing the strategy as their own for personal gain. FrozenImpact sued for several thousand Reddit upvotes, 300 NA server ladder points, and compensatory e-fame.
While the court acknowledged that the plaintiff presented a preponderance of evidence that indicated they were the original author of the build, the court also held that attempting to copyright a concept as simple as 2-rax pressure shows an “unforgivable level of self-unaware douchebaggery.”
“Keeping a great TvP build secret violates the Due Protoss clause of the StarCraft Constitution,” wrote Justice Shaun Clark in a 2,000 word opinion, adding that defendant Lillekanin still managed to accomplish something for the public good in spite of their “idiotic and deeply misguided fame-seeking.”
The case was the first heard by the court involving entirely unknown StarCraft 2 players hotly contesting negligible amounts of temporary Internet notoriety.
“Build orders — and your own minions — are notoriously difficult to execute, trust me,” said Justice Stemkoski. “However, the StarCraft community should stop naming things after people, whether its build orders or buildings.”
The court voted 8-0-1 against both parties, with the single abstain coming from Chief Justice David Kim.
“Both parties' arguments and feedback largely drives how we evaluated this case,” said Justice Kim in a press conference after the court's ruling was announced. “All of the topics discussed in this case remain a major focus for us, thank you very much and we look forward to deciding another case again soon.”
The conventional wisdom about DRAM error rates is that errors are rare, and the majority of the errors that do occur are so-called "soft errors"—randomly corrupted bits that have been flipped by incoming cosmic rays. But a recent large-scale study of DRAM errors released by Google turns this wisdom on its head, and in doing so reinforces the importance of error correction coding (ECC) and regular hardware replacement for datacenter machines.
Google's 2.5-year study of DRAM error rates in its datacenters is the largest such real-world study ever released; prior studies have been based on lab tests done under artificially high-stress conditions, with the results then extrapolated to give a picture of real-world conditions. Google engineers tracked errors as they happened, and logged both the errors and relevant data like temperature, CPU utilization, and memory allocated. After analyzing the data, they drew seven main conclusions about the nature, frequency, and causes of DRAM errors.
The headline conclusion in the study is that DRAM errors are vastly more common than is typically assumed. Nearly one-third of the individual machines in the study saw at least one error per year, a rate that's orders of magnitude higher than previous research had indicated. To give some hard numbers, previous studies report 200 to 5,000 failures in time per billion hours of operation (FIT) per Mbit; Google found that their numbers were between 25,000 and 75,000 FIT per Mbit.
On the bright side, most of these errors are the result of a few bad apples. About 8 percent of DIMMs were responsible for over 90 percent of the errors, as DIMMs that produced one error were hundreds of times more likely to produce another error in the same month.
Another lesson that Google learned is that older hardware is much more likely to fail; at about 20 months the error rate shoots up drastically. Perhaps not coincidentally, typical IT refreshes happen at about the three-year mark, and it wouldn't be surprising to see computer vendors latch onto this study as another data point in their quest to convince businesses that their ongoing freeze on upgrades will soon start to cost them more than it's saving them.
For large datacenters, Google's findings are especially important, because for different businesses the tipping point where the cost of error-induced downtime exceeds the cost of refreshes will fall at different times. In the absence of detailed data, it's easy to imagine a company that's focused on cutting costs pushing past this tipping point without knowing it.
The other big error factor that Google found was duty cycle—the higher the CPU utilization and memory allocation on a machine, the greater the odds of an error. In fact, utilization was much more strongly correlated with error rates than was temperature, despite the fact that most lab-based studies stress the latter factor as a large contributor to error rates. (Temperature does correlate to error rates, though, but just not as strongly and cleanly across platforms.)
The study's final conclusion, and the one most at odds with previous studies, is that hard errors dominate soft errors by far. Either defects in the chip or transmission problems in the memory subsystem cause more errors than external factors like cosmic rays. The researchers suggest that the unexpected dominance of hard errors might explain the drastically higher error rates observed vs. previous studies, which focused on soft errors.
Given the increased error rates that Google found, it turns out that ECC is even more important than previously thought. The presence of ECC can mean the difference between a recoverable error and a catastrophic, downtime-producing failure, so it's no wonder that datacenter builders insist on it. It's also the case that the type of ECC matters, with stronger ECC like chip-kill showing the ability to lower error rates by four to five times vs. weaker coding.
Never keep your emotions bottled up Last week I was considering the purchase of a piece of software. I went to the vendor's website for pricing. It wasn't there. Annoyed, I filled out the form so that I could be contacted by one of their sales people. The following day I got a response: Thanks for considering (product name deleted). Please write back to me with your phone # or call me at the # below -- we can discuss pricing as I learn about your application and how you plan to use (product name deleted) for development. So I sent an email with the following response: Hi (name deleted), OK. Please bear with me for just a moment while I vent. #ifdef FRUSTRATED_RANT First, I hate the fact that you guys don't put pricing on your website. I looked up the old version of your site using archive.org, so I've got a ballpark idea of what the pricing was around six months ago. Mostly I just want to know if anything has changed. Second, it's absurd that when a customer asks for pricing, you won't give it to them. Instead, you answer the question with a question. I'm not even the slightest bit interested in telling you about our application and how we plan to use (product name deleted) for development. I just want to know your pricing and your license terms. And for the hat trick, it's incredibly frustrating that you want to do this by phone. I hate phones with a passion, especially when they're completely unnecessary. Bottom line: I'm interested in buying your product. The only obstacle in my way is YOU. If your product didn't have such a great reputation, I would give up right now. #endif OK, sorry about that. I figured if I get all this off my chest then I'll have a much better chance of getting through our phone call without saying anything rude. Please call me at 217-XXX-YYYY. I promise to be nice. :-) -- Eric Fortunately, my "vent before the call" strategy worked out very well. The sales person called me and we had a very pleasant and cordial conversation.
The world's second largest fashion retailer recently made a deliberate move to attract members of the world's second largest religion, and people have taken notice.
More specifically, H&M featured a Muslim hijabi woman for a split second in this video advertising spot that deftly disguises a sly cost-saving measure as an eco-friendly call for “sustainable fashion.” The spot concludes, “Leave your unwanted garments in any of our 3,300 stores. We reuse them or recycle them into new clothes. Recycling one single T-shirt saves 2,100 liters of water.” Makes you wonder how much money it saves H&M—though unsurprisingly, the ad doesn't say.
More notably, the ad includes a sort of festival of other “others,” resulting in an awkward spectacle of diversity porn that begs to be shared and tweeted by all those progressive and free-thinking folks who have no problem letting multinational companies into their hearts, minds and closets.
The H&M “Close the Loop” ad's cast of characters is extensive, painfully contrived and devoid of context. Aside from the hijabi model, Mariah Idrissi, the short spot also features the following parade of corporately manufactured diversity:
Eleven Sikh men in multicolored turbans, a white woman over 40 who dares to wear a short skirt while lying on a bed with a blond black woman and reaching their arm out to a young tuxedoed white man sitting on the floor, an ethnically ambiguous man sporting a 5 o'clock shadow and a skirt, two black women in red hats, a trans woman in a drugstore aisle wearing ornate body armor, another trans woman looking at themselves in the mirror, a full-figured white woman filling a parking meter while daring to mix red and pink, a couple of Latinas in black overalls and excess eyeliner sitting on a red sports car with palm trees and an RV parked in the background, a sheikh (or so the voiceover claims), a blond white woman wearing short shorts and a bustier as they pose unnaturally on top of a sink, a shirtless (and apparently commando) Iggy Pop holding a running garden hose, a boxer (human, not K9) with a prosthetic leg, and so much more.
Yes, it's absurd. Yes, it's random. And yes, it's calculated. Like any shrewd retailer, H&M wants you to buy their products, no matter your race, religion, size, age or gender identity. While I strongly support more and better media representations of Muslims, Sikhs, members of the LGBT community, older women and people of color, I'm not about to commend H&M here. For one, their most prominent ads still tend to feature unnaturally thin white women.
More importantly though, squeezing as many minorities as possible into a single one-and-a-half-minute clip full of badly executed stereotypes is not an ideal way to go about promoting genuine diversity or acceptance. If anything, such tactics tend to further otherize and exoticize members of the different minority groups represented by lumping them all together and limiting their inclusion elsewhere amid the majority.
Listening to the ad's creepy voiceover (courtesy of Iggy Pop), I noticed the single hijabi model is linked to the term “chic,” while the white woman posing on top of a sink (sex blogger Karley Sciortino) is linked the term “liberated.” While the Muslimah may in fact look chic, the white woman doesn't look all that liberated, given their shorts and bustier appear to restrict healthy circulation.
All this to say, I highly doubt H&M has any interest in true diversity or feminist liberation. H&M is a multinational company, and its interest is in maximizing profits. If you don't believe me, just ask Human Rights Watch or any of the Cambodian women or children H&M has employed for next to nothing.
As a Muslim woman who chooses not to wear hijab, I maintain great respect for my Muslim sisters who do wear it, whether they're models or not. For many Muslimahs who choose to cover their hair, the hijab is not simply a symbol of modesty or piety, but a symbol of feminism itself—a concept brilliantly related by writer Hanna Yusuf in this video blog for The Guardian.
Feminist hijabi women like Hanna are not just opting out of rigid Western standards of beauty by choosing to cover, many are also opting out of the consumerist culture that perpetuates such standards. This powerful act of resistance threatens advertisers and corporations that rely on their constructed notions of beauty—often based in perceived heterosexual male fantasies—to sell all sorts of products. For that revolutionary act alone, I have to give a loud shout-out to those of my hijabi sisters who have refused to be complicit in the blatant commodification of our bodies and the corporate infiltration of our minds. We may not choose to fight this fight in the same way, but there is no doubt that we are in it together.

-A curious adult June 25, 2014 That is a very interesting question! And one that many people wonder about. In fact, we answered a very similar question many years ago. Twin genetics depend on what kind of twins we are talking about. Having identical twins is not genetic. On the other hand, fraternal twins can run in families. Genetics can definitely play a role in having fraternal twins. For example, a woman that has a sibling that is a fraternal twin is 2.5 times more likely to have twins than average! However, for a given pregnancy, only the mother's genetics matter. Fraternal twins happen when two eggs are simultaneously fertilized instead of just one. A father's genes can't make a woman release two eggs. It sounds like fraternal twins do indeed run in your family! But, since your son is the father, their genes are on the wrong side of the family tree. So, your family history likely didn't play a role in their wife's twin pregnancy. The answer would be different if you were asking about a daughter. Also, although your son's family history of twins can't increase their wife's chance of having twins, they can pass those genes down to your granddaughter. With your strong family history of fraternal twins, this just might increase the chances of your granddaughter having twins! But, your daughter-in-law is not necessarily having twins because of their genetics. Other things like environment, nutrition, age, and weight have also been linked to having twins as well. And there is always simple chance…every woman has a chance at having fraternal twins. It is just that some women have a higher or lower chance. Huh? Help Me Understand the Genetics! Wait a minute. One type of twins has a genetic basis and the other does not? And, only the mom's genetics matter? How is that possible? Don't worry. It makes a lot of sense once we break down the biology.
The important difference between identical and fraternal twins is the number of fertilized eggs involved. Identical twins come from a single fertilized egg. Fraternal twins come from two different ones. Identical twins happen when a single embryo splits in two soon after fertilization. This is why identical twins have identical DNA. They came from the same fertilized egg. Since embryo splitting is a random event that happens by chance, it doesn't run in families. Genes are not involved. The same is not true for fraternal twins. Fraternal twins happen when two independent eggs are each fertilized by different sperm. This is why the DNA of fraternal twins is different. In fact, fhe DNA of fraternal twins is no more similar than the DNA any other sibling pair. Usually, a woman only releases a single egg at a time. Fraternal twins can only happen if a mother releases two eggs in one cycle. This is called hyperovulation. Unlike embryo splitting, ovulation is a normal biological process that is controlled by our genes. And, different women can have different versions of these ovulation genes. Some women have versions (called alleles) of these genes that make them more likely to hyperovulate. This means there is a higher chance that two eggs could get fertilized at once, leading to fraternal twins. The gene versions that increase the chance of hyperovulation can be passed down from parent to child. This is why fraternal twins run in families. However, only women ovulate. So, the mother's genes control this and the fathers don't. This is why having a background of twins in the family matters only if it is on the mother's side. And why your son's family genetics did not play a role in their twins. We went over a lot of this stuff in our previous answer, but your question got me thinking. Our last answer on twins was done so long ago. Has recent research discovered anything new on this fascinating topic? They have indeed… at least if you are a sheep!
When it comes to developing a niche market in today's massive sea of streetwear labels aiming to attain a cult-like following, little manage to do so as effortlessly and organically as nascent imprint Anti Social Social Club. Helmed by Stussy's Social Marketing Manager, Neek Lurk, the indie label brought to fruition as a means to cater to a crowd rarely represented, specializes in and has gained much traction for its relatable graphic messaging, pastel-colored garments and unorthodox product roll-outs.
Fresh off of the debut of their UK-exclusive collection with premier clothier Dover Street Market, and a weekend which saw a bevy of new releases for the brand, all of which are now sold out, we caught up with the enigmatic “Vibe Curator” for a visceral understanding of Anti Social Social Club and their visual diary of emotions Enough of You in a candid interview filled with twists and turns of spontaneous utterance one might encounter with Neek on a night out in Los Angeles, CA.
Hey Neek, how's it going?
Jetlagged. Just got home [from] cruising downtown L.A. in the whip. Just put some more engine mods to make it go faster and now at home drinking some Jameson.
So, let's dive right into it. What pushes an introvert to make a social club for the socially impaired?
It's just me. People never liked me honestly. Growing up I envied people and it got to the point where I just did not give a fuck. I remember back in high school, I couldn't get in a house party because of who I was. It stuck with me and I only hang with people who feel the same way. At the beginning of this year, New Years Eve to be exact, I was at a party, and felt an uncomfortable feeling driving home fucked up. I fell asleep into a new year. [With] that same feeling, I created Anti Social Social Club. It was never to be a brand, more like a life project. More like my lowest days into tangible items. It's for losers, weirdos, negativity, people into bondage and BDSM, porn lovers; oh…and people that get the bigger picture and meaning.
With slogans like “Get Weird” and “Never Not Weird,” do you feel the need for Anti Social Social Club to remain unconventional?
Unconventional? No, Like I said before it's just me. Every thought, every emotion that makes me feel a certain way makes the designs. Honestly, when I get pissed me off is when I create things. It's a way to get my thoughts out in the world. It's a perception that translates into something else. It gets lost in translation, but at the end of the day, that's the beauty of this project. Being fucked up and being fucked over plenty of times gets me going -— a high that doesn't go away. I cut off many people in my life, and those people [get] my creative juices flowing. Have you ever been so low in your life that you drink your sorrows away and everyone leaves you? It's a sad song that plays on repeat in your head, a cancer that never goes way. This is what makes me create, and this is what keeps me going. It's not a positive thing, but that's what's real.
Walk us through your strangest day to date?
Everyday is a strange day for me. A boring day is when things are normal. You wake up, you eat, you sleep. I don't like that at all. Unexpected feelings and change of events are the best. I really like when I do something to people and they don't speak to me at all. They have this perception and are afraid. Then I asked myself…”Why did you even hang out with me in the first place? Is it because of my brand? My lifestyle?” If you don't accept me for who I am then be it. I guess I scare people away. But those who stick with me are in the Club.
You were recently in Tokyo, correct? What's nightlife like for Neek Lurk in Tokyo?
Drinking Highballs every night. Drinking beers on the street because it's legal. Smoking in restaurants while eating food. Oh, and the Stussy 35th Aniverssay party where I got carried to my hotel room and blacked out. Hanging with the art squad, lurking around with Will Sweeney, OG Adam and Gasius.
Your go-to song for your Myspace profile was?
Japanther – Metal Bike.
Worst advice you've ever received?
Make a business plan.
With streetwear's recent fascination with the 6-panel cap, it seems every brand has one. Yours however translates in a visual language not often tapped into, from coloring to graphics. What do you envision when designing the Club's gear?
I do what I like. I make things of the moment's feeling in my life. I take [my] the darkest thoughts and make them a little brighter, a perception per se. Whatever that minute of my life entails is when I make the gear. Whether getting choked out in a car, friends not talking to me, doing nice things to people and them never talking to [me] again. That sparks an idea to make me create my next graphic. I shouldn't even call it design anymore. Keep it organic and natural, and that brings out something that sticks to people. Oh, and Japanese porn—that's performance art.
Describe the last video you recorded on your cell phone?
It was in my Camaro on the 6th Street bridge in Downtown L.A., driving 140 MPH making a turn at 11pm. I had an orgasm.
Go-to meal priced $10 or under?
I don't remember having a meal under $10 recently. L.A. food is expensive and I have been eating out everyday and paying for everyone's meals.
You seem to hold Anti Social close to the chest. How do collaborations come about?
I said it 100 times before, it's just organic things that come to me. If I feel that it's forced and not coming from a place of honesty and weirdness, then I won't do it. The more I feel a certain way, the more I want to do it.
A couple of months back, you launched Enough of You. What are three things you've had enough of?
1. People who hang out with me just to hang out.
2. People who owe me money.
3. Koreans.
Flip phone or slide phone?
Flip. Slide phone's suck and I never had a Sidekick because it was too mainstream.
In what ways have growing up in the age of the Internet helped shape your outlook on streetwear today? Trends seem to be going quickly these days.
Not killing myself and saved my sanity.
2015 in one word?
Weird.
What can we expect moving forward?
More events in Los Angeles, more mods on my Camaro, and my stuff at Dover Street Market London & Ginza.
Young Indigenous filmmakers tackle crime and its consequences
Posted
The NSW Aboriginal Legal Service is trying to change the high incarceration rate among young Indigenous people by helping them make films about the consequences of crime.
Young Indigenous people are 24 times more likely to be in custody than non-Indigenous youths.
Last night young people travelled from Wagga Wagga, Bourke and Moruya for the premiere of their work in Redfern, Sydney.
The short films were made by people aged 12 to 17.
The project was funded by the Law and Justice Foundation to help educate young people about the legal system.
Fourteen-year-old Kade Dixon from Bourke in the state's north-west made a film about a group of young people who steal some scooters.
I realised if I want to do something good with my future, that means putting myself first and not just hanging around with my mates that do wrong. Peaches, young Indigenous filmmaker.
"The first one we made was Think Twice Before you Steal and it's a story about some kids stealing another kid's scooter from the wharf," they said.
Twelve-year-old Katie Brooksen was in another film about domestic violence in Bourke.
"I pretty much did everything, I did some filming, I helped write the script and I played a role in the video," they said.
"There are heaps of domestic violence so we're trying to give the message, and I think they might listen because it's local people in our community."
Young people just 'going down the wrong track'
Young people from Moruya on the far south coast made a film about three young footballers who are ready to play before a NRL scout.
One of the boys steals a pair of boots at the local sport shops and gets arrested.
Seventeen-year-old Peaches said the group from Moruya wanted to show the consequences of crime.
"Young kids with a lot of opportunities that can do great in life and just going down the wrong track," they said.
"They have a lot of opportunities and a lot of people that can help them be put in their right places, so they can provide a better future for themselves."
Peaches said the story had a personal resonance for them
"To be honest I've been down that track," they said.
"I've done a lot of crime in my past, for my age, my young age, break and enters, doing shops over, hotties [stolen cars], all the bad stuff."
They said they stopped offending last year when they made a promise to their grandfather.
"Last year, my pop passed away and they wanted me to do something good with my future," they said.
"So I realised if I want to do something good with my future, that means putting myself first and not just hanging around with my mates that do wrong."
Gary Oliver, the CEO of the NSW and ACT Legal Service, said projects like these were trying to change the high detention rates among young Indigenous people.
"I think engaging people at this stage in their life is what's important," they said.
"I think engaging with them and making use they're aware of their rights as well and it gives people the thought that there are other paths for them.
"So it isn't always the path of following others, but the path of doing what you're passionate about.
"Hopefully this is one of the paths people can follow."

It was analytics-in-the-NFL week last week at the MMQB, with Albert Breer first looking at what analytics even are in the context of professional football, how these metrics are developed and how they are being used and by whom. They broke this down the next day to explore further just how all 32 teams use the ever-increasing amount of specific team and player data available and how much the data informs their decision-making. Unsurprisingly, a good deal of the first piece centers around the Cleveland Browns.
Indeed, the Browns have become synonymous with the word “analytics” in the NFL. That's even despite Breer's noting that “Most teams don't shy away from analytics,” incorporating the data from both a “player acquisition” standpoint and, “On the coaching side... to make staffs more efficient.” Though some teams incorporate the use of analytical data more than others—”More than three-quarters of NFL teams employ either a director of analytics or have a full-blown analytics department,” writes Breer—and data-providing services like Pro Football Focus and Stats LLC work with 27 and 26 of the league's teams, respectively, the Browns have quickly become the poster children for such an approach.
The reason is simple: The Browns made many, public moves to take a more analytical approach to their front-office happenings, particularly when it comes to adding and subtracting players. Executive Vice President of Football Operations Sashi Brown brought aboard former Oakland Athletics executive Paul DePodesta to serve as Chief Strategy Officer. Former Dallas Cowboys analyst Ken Kovash has been in Cleveland since 2013 (predating Brown and the Hue Jackson-led coaching staff), but last year was promoted to Vice President of Player Personnel alongside Andrew Berry, who holds the same title. Breer also notes that “[t]hree others in player personnel have ‘research,' ‘strategy' or both in their titles”—those would be Kevin Meers (Director of Research and Strategy), Dave Giuliani (Football Research Analyst) and Andrew Healey (Senior Strategist for Player Personnel).
Brown has tried to downplay just how much influence this group has on the Browns' overall strategy, saying:
“Our structure isn't designed to give rise to analytics, but to the end we want to incorporate it, I think it's a desire to win. If you tell me there are some answers out there or some information out there that can improve our team, stuff that we don't have, I don't care what you call it, I'm interested. Now, it's gonna have to prove its mettle. But if you are honest and open about your objectives, humble enough and non-territorial enough, then I think it's a natural thing that most people would want... It's a new century.”
But it's hard not to see how this approach has already managed to reshape the Browns. Though the tenure of the current administration has been short, the fingerprint of the analytics department has been felt primarily through the team's actions regarding trading players and amassing draft picks. It was not a coincidence that Cleveland came away with 14 drafted players a year ago, 10 this year and have 12 picks already in 2018 (five of which are in the first two rounds). And the trade with the Houston Texans for quarterback Brock Osweiler, in which the Browns brought them aboard not for their talents under center but the 2018 second-round draft pick that came along with their acquisition, also fits the mold.
Breer has noted, though, that the Browns are “trying to figure out where analytics lines up with scouting and coaching.” The front office's desires aren't absolute; for example, Breer reported that the data would have led to the Browns drafting quarterback Mitchell Trubisky with the first-overall pick in the 2017 draft but that the coaching staff preferred—and got—linebacker Myles Garrett.
These desires should not be absolute, as player attributes, both tangible and less-so, must also be taken into account when bringing a player on to (or off of) the roster. As an AFC personnel executive said to Breer, “Maybe your model doesn't like a guy that your scouts like, so let's find out why the model doesn't like the player... It could be position specific. It could be a stat. There are lots of reasons why a scout may like a player and your model wouldn't.”
This is the balance the Browns, and all teams in the league, need to strike. As the AFC executive said, “In a perfect world, the scout and model both like the player.” There must be a way to evaluate a football player as a person and athlete as well as a collection of numbers and data points, to incorporate more advanced methods of evaluation with the traditional methods of a scouting department traveling the country and breaking down game tape.
This appears to be the Browns' goal, though of course determining whether this process proves successful ultimately hinges on the numbers of wins it produces. But it should be noted that the Browns' dependence on analytics is not an outlier in the NFL as a whole; it was just a more public, auspicious version of a transition that nearly every club in the league has been making to some degree or another for years.
Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) called approval of the Keystone XL pipeline “a matter of life and death” for the billionaire Koch brothers as Democrats work to link GOP support for the controversial energy project to the conservative mega-donors.
"This for them should be a matter of life and death," said Markey in an interview with Martin Bashir on MSNBC Wednesday.

“The clean energy revolution is moving so fast, the reduction in the amount of oil we are using in America is proceeding so quickly, that they are an endangered species if they can't stop this new technological revolution,” they said of the oil industry and their supporters.
The Koch brothers — owners of the Kansas-based conglomerate Koch Industries — have backed numerous conservative causes including the Tea Party group Americans for Prosperity.
By linking the pipeline to the Koch brothers, Democrats hope to question GOP motives for supporting the project.
“The oil industry wants to take the dirtiest oil from Canada, bring it through a pipeline in the United States with no guarantee that it stays here in order to export it to the thirstiest markets across the planet with almost no benefit to us,” alleged Markey.
At a hearing Wednesday, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) suggested that Koch Industries could benefit financially from approval of the Alberta-to-Texas oil pipeline, and called for a minority hearing into the matter.
Philip Ellender, president of government and public affairs at Koch Companies Public Sector, strongly denied that the company stands to benefit from approval of the pipeline.
Last week, President Obama rejected a permit for the pipeline. House Republicans have vowed to consider measures to force the pipeline's construction.

President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday hinted Russia could impose additional U.S. diplomatic staff cuts after the closure of its San Francisco consulate.
“If we talk about full parity, then it is not 455 U.S. diplomats in Moscow, but [455] minus 155,” they told reporters at the closing of the BRICS summit in China.
The statement comes after Moscow imposed a Sept. 1 deadline for the U.S. diplomatic mission to cut its staff to 455.
Russia's Foreign Ministry issued the “suggestion” to bring the number of U.S. diplomatic staff to the same level as Russian diplomats in the U.S., after Congress overwhelmingly passed a bill tightening sanctions on Russia over allegations of election interference.
Putin, however, on Tuesday said the agreed number of Russian and U.S. diplomatic staff “includes 155 people working for the United Nations.”
“So we reserve the right to decide on the number of American diplomats in Moscow,” they said at the Xiamen conference.
The White House has said President Donald Trump personally ordered the closure of the San Francisco consulate and annexes in Washington D.C. and New York late last week.
The move caused an uproar in Moscow, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claiming FBI officers had searched the San Francisco consulate. Russia had also been told by the U.S. State Department that it would be forced to sell the building, they said.
“The fact that the Americans reduced the number of our diplomatic institutions is their right,” Putin told reporters. “A different matter is that it was clearly done in such a boorish manner. That doesn't speak well of our American partners.”
Putin called the confiscation of the consulate building in San Francisco “unprecedented” and “a violation of Russia's property rights.”
They said they would instruct Russia's Foreign Ministry to take the matter to court. “Let's see how effective the widely praised American judicial system is,” Putin said.
If you're driving a nanocar on the open road, things are bound to get sticky.
Rice University researchers who developed the first nanocars and colleagues at North Carolina State University found in recent tests that driving their vehicles in ambient conditions -- exposed to open air, rather than a vacuum -- got dicey after a time because the hydrophobic single-molecule cars stuck to the "road" and created what amounted to large speed bumps.
The findings were reported in the American Chemical Society's Journal of Physical Chemistry C.
The work by Rice chemist James Tour, NC State analytical chemist Gufeng Wang and their colleagues came as Rice prepares to take part in the first NanoCar Race in Toulouse, France, in October. Rice researchers are members of one of five international teams that plan to enter the competition.
Just like in the macro world, driving conditions are important for moving nanocars. Though the race will be run in an ultra-cold vacuum, the Rice researchers thought it wise to study how their latest model of nanocars would fare in a more natural setting.
"Our long-term goal is to make nanomachines that operate in ambient environments," Tour said. "That's when they will show potential to become useful tools for medicine and bottom-up manufacturing."
The newest generation of Rice nanocars features adamantane wheels that are slightly hydrophobic (water-repellent). Tour said some hydrophobicity is important to help keep the nanocars attached to a surface, but if the tires are too hydrophobic, the cars could become permanently immobilized. That is because hydrophobic things tend to stick together to minimize the amount of surface area that is in contact with water. Things that are hydrophilic, or water-liking, are more amenable to floating freely in water, Tour said.
In the latest Rice tests with the new tires, the nanocars were placed on surfaces that were either clean glass or glass coated with the polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG). Glass is the most frequently used substrate in nanocar research. Tour said the PEG-coated glass slides were used for their anti-fouling -- nonsticky -- properties, while the clean glass slides were treated with hydrogen peroxide so the hydrophobic wheels wouldn't stick.
They said the cars weren't so much being driven as undergoing "directed diffusion" in the tests. The point, they said, was to establish the kinetics of nanocar movement and understand the potential energy surface interaction between the car and surface over time.
"We want to know what makes a nanocar 'hit the brakes' and how much external energy we need to apply to start it moving again," they said.
The researchers let their cars run freely on a solid surface exposed to the air and tracked their movements by exciting embedded fluorescent tags.
The cars that moved via Brownian diffusion slowed down during the 24 hours that the slides were under observation. Tour said slides absorbed molecules from the air; as more and more of these molecules stuck to the surface, the slides become progressively more "dirty" throughout the experiment. Each nanocar is a single, complex molecule that contains just a few hundred atoms, so any other molecules they encounter on the roadway are huge obstacles that act like sticky foam. Each collision with one of these obstructions makes the nanocar slow down, and eventually the cars become permanently stuck.
Wang said that from an energy perspective -- that is, the energetic relationship between the molecular cars and those that make up the road -- molecules adsorbed from air generate many potential energy wells, just like puddles on the potential energy surface. These puddles can slow or permanently trap the nanocars.
Tests showed that nearly twice as many of the cars appeared to move on the nonsticking PEG slides, and all moved a little faster than those on the bare glass.
The researchers noted that they could not view the new models with scanning tunneling microscopes because those only work in a vacuum and they emit energy that could influence movement of the cars. For this reason, the researchers tagged each nanocar with a fluorescent marker and used confocal microscopes to track the cars' movements.
The day before Sunday's health care vote, President Obama gave an unscripted talk to House Democrats. Near the end, they spoke about why their party should pass reform: “Every once in a while a moment comes where you have a chance to vindicate all those best hopes that you had about yourself, about this country, where you have a chance to make good on those promises that you made ... And this is the time to make true on that promise. We are not bound to win, but we are bound to be true. We are not bound to succeed, but we are bound to let whatever light we have shine.”
And on the other side, here's what Newt Gingrich , the Republican former speaker of the House — a man celebrated by many in their party as an intellectual leader — had to say: If Democrats pass health reform, “They will have destroyed their party much as Lyndon Johnson shattered the Democratic Party for 40 years” by passing civil rights legislation.
I'd argue that Mr. Gingrich is wrong about that: proposals to guarantee health insurance are often controversial before they go into effect — Ronald Reagan famously argued that Medicare would mean the end of American freedom — but always popular once enacted.
But that's not the point I want to make today. Instead, I want you to consider the contrast: on one side, the closing argument was an appeal to our better angels, urging politicians to do what is right, even if it hurts their careers; on the other side, callous cynicism. Think about what it means to condemn health reform by comparing it to the Civil Rights Act. Who in modern America would say that L.B.J. did the wrong thing by pushing for racial equality? (Actually, we know who: the people at the Tea Party protest who hurled racial epithets at Democratic members of Congress on the eve of the vote.)

And that cynicism has been the hallmark of the whole campaign against reform.
Yes, a few conservative policy intellectuals, after making a show of thinking hard about the issues, claimed to be disturbed by reform's fiscal implications (but were strangely unmoved by the clean bill of fiscal health from the Congressional Budget Office ) or to want stronger action on costs (even though this reform does more to tackle health care costs than any previous legislation). For the most part, however, opponents of reform didn't even pretend to engage with the reality either of the existing health care system or of the moderate, centrist plan — very close in outline to the reform Mitt Romney introduced in Massachusetts — that Democrats were proposing.

Instead, the emotional core of opposition to reform was blatant fear-mongering, unconstrained either by the facts or by any sense of decency.

Over a 100 people follow me out of the National Stadium located in Warsaw. We're on a collective mission. Over the course of 90 minutes, the group will create a massive crime scene complete with victims, killers and motives. Together they will transform into a collaborative Sherlock Holmes as they scour through clues and attempt not to containment their crime scenes.
Welcome to Sherlock Holmes & the Internet of Things, a prototype of the Columbia Digital Storytelling Lab that experiments with shifts in authorship and ownership of stories while exploring the ethical and political implications of IoT (Internet of Things). For the last 10 months, Nick Fortugno and myself have staged meetups throughout NYC. A steady stream of storytellers, game designers, hackers, makers and fans of Sherlock Holmes have flowed through the meetups, in an attempt to reimagine the works of Sir Arthur C. Doyle. From a few hours to full day sessions - we've designed, built and prototyped the foundation that will be used to stage a series of connected crimes scenes around the world later this fall.
By the end of 2015, it is anticipated that there will be over 1.5 trillion sensors in the world. Everything from cars to household appliances to everyday objects are rapidly connecting to networks. The Internet of Things is positioned to be the largest deployment of connected devices, dwarfing PCs, tablets and smartphones combined. The opportunity this presents for laying storytelling over the physical world is exciting. Stories that can aid the discovery, personalization and connection of people to places and things. With any new emergent form of storytelling comes the need for a grammar. So what will a 21st Century re-write look like?
Test, Break & Repeat
We've run 15 prototypes in 10 countries since the project started last September and a number of design principals have emerged.

As the Big 12 Conference debates the merits of expansion, the Texas Longhorns are reportedly pressuring in-state schools like the Texas Tech Red Raiders and TCU Horned Frogs to withhold the critical vote in favor of moving back to 12 teams while waiting for a "clear, compelling case" to emerge in favor of it.
One other critical entity is ready for its own showdown -- Oklahoma board of regents chairperson Max Weitzenhoffer told CBS Sports that the regents will meet on Thursday to discuss Big 12 expansion and the role president David Boren is playing in it. Boren is chairperson of the Big 12 presidents and has been a vocal advocate for expansion and the dissolution of the Longhorn Network in recent months.
However, Weiztenhoffer also told ESPN's Jake Trotter that expansion is not on the agenda for Thursday and they don't think it will get brought up. So the ultimate discussion between the regents and with Boren may not happen this week.
But back to the larger point -- Weitzenhoffer and at least one other Oklahoma regent aren't in favor of expansion and want to press Boren on what the school plans to do:
"We will have a lot of input [on Oklahoma's view of expansion]," Weitzenhoffer said of the regents. "The problems is, the reason I got so bent out of shape on this is we're coming to that crunch time and they're all trying to decide what to do. "We think all these Big 12 presidents can do this thing without going through boards of regents. We're not sure about Texas. The fact is we just want to make sure they [Boren] understands where we are. I don't want to speak for all of us. "We're going to force the president to tell us where we stand."
In another conversation, Weitzenhoffer was much more strident about their opposition to expansion:
Spoke to OU board chair Max Weitzenhoffer, as well. They said, "I just don't feel expansion is in the best interest of our football program." — Jake Trotter (@Jake_Trotter) May 9, 2016
Much like Texas, Weitzenhoffer wants to hear a strong case made for expansion because they recognize that only schools from Power Five conferences make sense as additions and none of those schools are currently available because of grants of rights.
More than anything else, the looming issue with Big 12 expansion is that while the conference may have a better chance of making the College Football Playoffs with 12 teams and a conference title game, adding schools like BYU, Cincinnati, Colorado State, Connecticut, Memphis, or South Florida doesn't necessarily make the league more appealing to television networks that are preparing for major upheaval in how customers consume their products.
And while the supposed pressuring tactics of Texas make the 'Horns once again look like the big bullies in the neighborhood, remaining realistic about the quality of programs available is a prudent move. Now it looks like Texas has an unexpected ally in that stance.
Joanne Cassar, who underwent gender reassignment surgery to become a woman and was denied the right to marry because of a lacuna in the law, has taken the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg demanding compensation.
The 29-year-old had won the right to marry but this was overturned on appeal last week when a judge ruled that, although they had their human rights breached, the problem was in the law and they could not marry.
Ms Cassar's legal saga started in 2006 when the Marriage Registrar refused to issue marriage banns although their birth certificate had been changed to indicate they were now a woman.
The appeals court ruled there was a lacuna in the law that did not allow people to enter into any form of life partnership after undergoing gender reassignment surgery.
In the appeal to the European Court yesterday, Ms Cassar asked for a declaration that the Director of Public Registry could not refuse to issue the marriage banns just because they underwent gender reassignment surgery.
They also said that taking into consideration the fact that the case took seven years to conclude, there was a breach of human rights and since they were not granted a legal remedy or compensation in that regard, they called for compensation and a remedy to the situation.
Ms Cassar had undergone surgery in the UK when they were 22 after being diagnosed with gender identity disorder, a conflict between a person's physical or apparent gender and that person's self-identification.
Lawyers Josè Herrera and David Camilleri are representing Ms Cassar.
• Manchester United's 18-year-old scored early in 2-1 win over Australia • ‘He's done their chances of coming in the final 23 no harm,' says Hodgson
Roy Hodgson acknowledged that Marcus Rashford had done their hopes of being a member of England's squad for the European Championship in France a power of good after the 18-year-old Manchester United striker scored on their international debut on Friday night.
“I am pleased with him,” said England's coach, who saw Rashford's third-minute volley set England on the way to a 2-1 win against Australia in Sunderland. “He's done their chances of coming in the final 23 no harm. But they wouldn't have been in the 26 if I didn't think they had a chance. I guess it [the debut goal] will chop a few trees down tomorrow. I thought Marcus did well – but I wasn't nervous about them or surprised how well they played.”
Hodgson was enthused not only with Rashford's ability to switch to a wide role after Wayne Rooney came on in the second half but their evident chemistry with Manchester City's Raheem Sterling.
“There was good link-up play between them and Raheem,” they said. “They don't have an awful lot of experience playing in that system but they were both very lively.
“We saw the best of them together and we knew that, with those two together, we would be very dangerous on the counter because of their pace. When Wayne came on, Marcus played on the flank and showed what they could do there. They tired late – but that's understandable.”
England's coach admitted they had some vexing decisions to make as they whittle their squad down to 23 before Tuesday's midnight deadline. “There'll be two or three more sleepless nights before I submit my list,” they said.
Although Daniel Sturridge – who was not involved due to a calf strain – later told reporters they were fit to return to training, the Liverpool forward is likely to endure some anxious moments before Tuesday. The good news for Sturridge is that, despite Rashford's emergence, Hodgson seems minded possibly to take both forwards.
“Daniel's a quality player,” the coach said. “I know Daniel Sturridge. If it turns out the injury would mean they were unfit to play Russia in Marseille [in England's first match of Euro 2016], that might make a difference – but I have no indication it is serious enough to keep them out.”
There were times when Australia dominated the game and Hodgson conceded it had been a “stern test” against the Asian Champions. “It was a tough game, Australia are good, they're European standard,” they said. “But I was pleased with aspects of our play. We were dangerous on the break and I was pleased so many players who didn't start against Turkey (in the previous friendly) showed what they could do.”
Image copyright EPA Image caption Marilyn Manson: 'The pain was excruciating'
Marilyn Manson has discussed for the first time the "excruciating" stage accident that resulted in a leg injury and nine postponed tour dates.
The singer was crushed when a giant prop gun collapsed on them during a concert in New York on 30 September.
"It was terrifying," said the rock star, who needed a plate and 10 screws in their fibula after the accident.
They told Yahoo news that, contrary to media reports, they were not responsible for the prop toppling over.
"I wasn't trying to climb it," said the 48-year-old.
"It started to fall and I tried to push back and I didn't get out the way in time.
"I'm not sure what I hit my head on, but it did fall on to my leg and break the fibula in two places. The pain was excruciating."

It took several minutes for the stage crew to free Manson, who appeared limp and unconscious.
As well as the injury to their lower leg, the star required a screw through their ankle bone. They have spent the last two weeks recovering at home in Los Angeles.
Manson said they regretted that their tour "got cut off right" just as they "was about to put it into second gear".
But they added, "I'll be back there really shortly, and it's going to be as exciting as it was starting out."
The star has rescheduled several US tour dates for January and February 2018.  They are due to play seven UK dates in December.

It's "precrime" meets "thoughtcrime." China is using its substantial surveillance apparatus as the basis for a "unified information environment" that will allow authorities to profile individual citizens based upon their online behaviors, financial transactions, where they go, and who they see. The authorities are watching for deviations from the norm that might indicate someone is involved in suspicious activity. And they're doing it with a hand from technology pioneered in the US.
As Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports, the Chinese government is leveraging "predictive policing" capabilities that have been used by US law enforcement, and it has funded research into machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies to identify human faces in surveillance video. The Chinese government has also used this technology to create a "Situation-Aware Public Security Evaluation (SAPE) platform" that predicts "security events" based on surveillance data, which includes anything from actual terrorist attacks to large gatherings of people.
The Chinese government has plenty of data to feed into such systems. China invested heavily in building its surveillance capabilities in major cities over the past five years, with spending on "domestic security and stability" surpassing China's defense budget—and turning the country into the biggest market for security technology. And in December, China's government gained a new tool in surveillance: anti-terrorism laws giving the government even more surveillance powers and requiring any technology companies doing business in China to provide assistance in that surveillance.
The law states that companies “shall provide technical interfaces, decryption and other technical support and assistance to public security and state security agencies when they are following the law to avert and investigate terrorist activities”—in other words, the sort of "golden key" that FBI Director James Comey has lobbied for in the US. For obvious reasons, the Chinese government is particularly interested in the outcome of the current legal confrontation between the FBI and Apple over the iPhone used by Syed Farook.
Bloomberg reports that China is harnessing all that data in an effort to perform behavioral prediction at an individual level—tasking the state-owned defense contractor China Electronics Technology Group to develop software that can sift through the online activities, financial transactions, work data, and other behavioral data of citizens to predict which will perform "terrorist" acts. The system could watch for unexpected transfers of money, calls overseas by individuals with no relatives outside the country, and other trigger events that might indicate they were plotting an illegal action. China's definition of "terrorism" is more expansive than that of many countries.
At a news conference in December, China Electronics Technology Group Chief Engineer Wu Manqing told reporters, "We don't call it a big data platform, but a united information environment… It's very crucial to examine the cause after an act of terror, but what is more important is to predict the upcoming activities.”
Full data enrichment profiles for more than 200 million people have been placed up for sale on the Darknet. The person offering the files claims the data is from Experian, and is looking to get $600 for everything.
Details of this incident came to Salted Hash via the secure drop at Peerlyst, where someone uploaded details surrounding the sale and the data. The data was first vetted by the technical review board at Peerlyst, who confirmed its legitimacy. Once it was cleared by the technical team, a sample of the data was passed over to Salted Hash for additional verification and disclosure.
Calls to individuals in the sample data went to voicemail and were not returned. Should any of them confirm their information, we'll update this story.
Salted Hash also reached out to Experian and one other firm, Acxiom, as sources have speculated the information that's up for sale aligns with enrichment data made available by these companies.
Acxiom did not respond to questions. However, sources at Experian said that they were made aware of this data breach last week, and investigations determined that it wasn't their data.
Instead, investigators believe the data on offer is a collection of records that's being labeled as Experian's in order to leverage the company's name.
“We've seen this unfounded allegation and similar rumors before. We investigated it again – and see no signs that we've been compromised based on our research and the type of data involved. Based on our investigations and the lack of credible evidence, this is an unsubstantiated claim intended to inflate the value of the data that they are trying to sell – a common practice by hackers selling illegal data,” Experian said in an emailed statement.
So while Experian investigators state the data isn't theirs, the fact that the data exists is still a problem.
The seller is taking things seriously too, limiting access to the data by refusing to deal with potential buyers who have newer accounts or those with only a few hundred dollars in previous transactions.
There are 203,419,083 people listed in 6GBs worth of records. The profiles include PII such as a person's name, full address, date of birth, and phone number, but because it's enrichment data - the records also include more than 80 personal attributes.
Among the additional attributes, profiles include a person's credit rating (listed A-H); the number of active accredit lines; whether the person is a credit card user; if they own or rent their home; the type of home the person lives in; marital status; the number of children a person has; how many children are in the home; occupational details; education; net worth; and total household income.
In addition, some records indicate a person's political donations, including fields denoting conservative donations, liberal donations, or general political causes.
Other fields list personal donations (i.e. veteran's charities, local community charities, healthcare charities, international charities, animal charities, arts or culture charities, children's charities); and financial investments (foreign and domestic, including personal investments, stocks and bonds, or real estate).
There are travel indicators too, including fields for people who travel internationally, and fields for those who visit casinos. Finally, the profiles indicate buying preferences, such as if a person is into home gardening, or has recently purchased auto parts.
Some of the information in the collected records was provided directly to the data broker by the individual at some point. But data brokers who offer data enrichment programs use a mix of opt-in details and sourced information. It's legal for them to collect, store, and share this information, provided they comply with various data regulations.
What this means is that there is no solid way to track where the attribute data came from.
Impact:
Commercially, while data brokers have learned to navigate the various data privacy laws, such as SB1386 and FCRA, now that this data is out there – it's fair game and available for anyone to use. While some of this data might have previously required permission before it could be used, that's no longer the case with this data set.
Salted Hash reached out to J. Tate, CISO of bits&digits, a counter and social intelligence agency with headquarters in Germany and Columbia, SC, about the data that's currently up for grabs. They said sets such as this one have reached a level of social desensitization that is dangerous.
“Not placing the necessary importance on your digital identity and collected marketing insights is one of the worst habits one can have,” Tate said.
“The information collected in this trove, no matter which data-broker or marketing enrichment system it came from is now in the hands of people that you will never know. What uses they provide to both marketers and nefarious scam artist are endless. This is my biggest concern, the data sets that are popping up around the world are not secured as regulation mandates, are providing easy to access credentials and intelligence points to facilitate complex identity fraud, human trafficking and money laundering operations across the globe.”
As far as criminal elements go, the data contained in this database is an identity thief's dream. Moreover, a list such as this allows a criminal to seek high-value targets in a given area based on net worth, travel habits, or supported cause.
Kidnapping is a certain possibility for anyone that has a household income of ‘S'( $250,000+) or a net worth of ‘I' ($499,999+), especially if they travel overseas. But there is also the chance that someone could take the list and create identifications for those that are over the age of 70 and use them to smuggle people into, or out of, the country.
On a technical level, anyone within the data set that uses the collected data for knowledge-based authentication is exposed, but it's also the case that this data can be used to gain access to such information indirectly.
Moreover, the data holds enough information to develop a sustained Phishing campaign, which could open the door to numerous other crimes.
“This data set alone (and there are many more) tells us who makes more than $100,000 a year in a given zip code and address; what allergies each member may have; how many home loans they have taken out in 15 years; how many pets; how often they shop; and about 80 other attributes. Until we start taking our data seriously, how can we expect the companies that barter and sell it to?” asked Tate, during a recent email conversation.

Although China is a party to the Refugee Convention of 1951, its protections were never extended to Hong Kong, and so there is no legal right, per se, for foreign nationals seeking asylum here. The United States and Hong Kong have a bilateral extradition treaty, and American federal prosecutors are reported to be preparing charges against Mr. Snowden.
However, foreigners may still approach the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here and seek asylum and resettlement elsewhere. (Mr. Snowden mentioned Iceland as one possible destination.) Mr. Snowden, if they faced imminent arrest, could also apply to the Hong Kong government against any orders to remove them to a place where they might face cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. (Given the treatment of Pfc. Bradley Manning, the WikiLeaks whistle-blower, Mr. Snowden would have at least a plausible case.)
Contrary to media reports, these protections offer a possibility, however slender, that the local judiciary — whose members were largely trained under the British system and have shown admirable independence — might protect him. It's not clear if any crimes Mr. Snowden might have committed would have been crimes under Hong Kong law — a prerequisite for extradition. The United States might also have to promise not to impose capital punishment on Mr. Snowden — which could be a major sticking point. Finally, our judges would have to make sure that any removal proceedings would be consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which our judges (unlike their American counterparts) take seriously.
All that said, Beijing holds the cards. In 2004, a Libyan dissident, Sami al-Saadi, and their family were reportedly detained by the Hong Kong authorities and forced back to Libya, without due process of law. Mr. Saadi complained that American and British intelligence officers took part in their forcible repatriation. They were subsequently subjected to torture and inhumane treatment. They have sued both the British and Hong Kong governments.
Our judiciary, however vital, has its limits. The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal is our highest court. But if a court case is understood to involve the Basic Law — the quasi-constitution of Hong Kong — the court can request from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, a political organ in Beijing, a reinterpretation of the Basic Law. China may also initiate its own request for interpretation — bypassing the judiciary entirely, though such pre-emptive action, in this case, could be bad for Beijing's image, as it could be seen as caving in to American demands, especially so soon after last week's summit meeting between President Obama and China's president, Xi Jinping.
These legal distinctions may seem confusing — and they confuse even Hong Kongers. They also explain why the United Nations Human Rights Committee has expressed concerns that such a “mechanism of binding constitutional interpretation by a nonjudicial body may weaken and undermine the rule of law and the independence of judiciary” in Hong Kong.
Mr. Snowden may have left Hong Kong, or be on their way out. Nevertheless, because they have shared, even briefly, in the legal uncertainties Hong Kongers have experienced since 1997, their case might at least draw greater international attention to the precarious state of individual freedoms here.
On June 8, during Israel's preemptive Six-Day War, an act of aggression, not self-defense against regional Arab states, the IDF did the unthinkable.
It provocatively attacked its main ally, striking the USS Liberty intelligence gathering ship, in international waters about 25.5 nautical miles northwest of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula in international waters.
The incident took 34 US lives, another 171 wounded, the vessel severely damaged, lucky to stay afloat.
It was deployed to monitor belligerents' communications in response to Israeli aggression on Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Iraq – not the other way around.
In August 1982, Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin admitted Israel had a choice, saying:
“The Egyptian Army concentrations in the Sinai approaches (did) not prove that (President Gamal Abdel) Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him.”
In February 1968, future Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin (1974 – 77 and 1992 – 95) told the French newspaper Le Monde:
“I do not believe Nasser wanted war. The two divisions which they sent into Sinai on May 14 would not have been enough to unleash an offensive against Israel. They knew it and we knew it.”
In 1978, Israeli Air Force Commander General Mordechai Hod said:
“Sixteen years of planning had gone into those initial eighty minutes. We lived with the plan. We slept on the plan. We ate the plan. Constantly we perfected it.”
In April 1972, IDF chief General Haim Barlev said
“(w)e were not threatened with genocide on the eve of the six-day war, and we had never thought of such a possibility.”
Other Israeli political and military officials admitted the same thing. Israel wasn't threatened. Yet it lawlessly and aggressively attacked four regional countries without just cause – along with its main ally America.
Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Thomas Moorer called Lyndon Johnson's failure to hold Israel accountable “one of the classic all-American coverups.”
Israel knew the ship's identity, its US flag clearly visible. Good weather conditions made it easy to spot.
Israeli warplanes circled overhead before attacking, at times low enough for US sailors to wave to its pilots. They waved back before opening fire with rockets and machine guns against the lightly armed vessel.
A second wave of planes used napalm, setting parts of the deck ablaze. Israeli attack boats struck the vessel with torpedoes, causing a 40-foot-wide hole in its hull, flooding lower compartments, causing the ship to list 10 degrees, a defenseless smoking hulk, lucky to avoid sinking.
Four other Israeli torpedoes missed their target. Its warplanes strafed the Liberty at close range.
The ship's radio frequencies were jammed to prevent a distress call for help. When finally able to communicate, it was too late. The damage was done, the human toll testimony to Israeli viciousness.
When attack began, the Liberty was following its signal-intercept mission off Sinai's coast in international waters at a speed of about five knots.
Israeli forces were ordered to fire on any unidentified vessels proceeding at over 20 knots – at the time, a speed only warships could attain.
The Liberty was clearly identified. Israeli claims otherwise were lies. It took 16 hours for two US destroyers to arrive, then a third warship.
Medical help was provided. Liberty was escorted to Malta for repairs enough to return to America.
Decommissioned a year later, the ship was removed from Naval Vessel Register listings, part of Washington's coverup.
Maintaining strong US/Israeli ties mattered more than the lives of its seamen. Liberty survivors were decorated quietly, its Captain William McGonagle (image on the left) awarded Congressional Medal of Honor recognition – the nation's highest award for valor in action against an enemy force.
Israeli aggression wasn't mentioned. A US Naval Court of Inquiry claimed no responsibility “to rule on the culpability of the attackers, and no evidence was heard from the attacking nation.”
It lied saying “available evidence combines to indicate a case of mistaken identity.”
At the same time, it found “heroism displayed by the commanding officer, (along with) officers and men of the Liberty exceptional.”
A Joint Chief of Staff's report contained evidence relating only to communication system failures. Nothing about Israeli aggression.
An unnamed CIA source said Israeli defense minister Moshe Dayan personally ordered the attack, wanting the Liberty sunk, its crew members killed.
Israel and America whitewashed the incident, part of covering up IDF aggression, committing war crimes against regional nations and its main ally.
Surviving crew members were ordered to stay silent about the incident. The disturbing truth is well known today – though officially the Big Lie about what happened persists.
Israel attacked the Liberty to prevent information on what it was up to from getting out – preemptively attacking four regional nations, seizing the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza, Syria's Golan Heights and Egypt's Sinai peninsula.
The Sinai was returned to Egypt as part of the 1978 Camp David Accords. Palestinian territories have remained illegally occupied since 50 years ago this month.

Everyone loves a picture of a penguin. Indeed, the one here is a particularly good example of the genre and the view through the ice reminds me of the famous picture by Herbert Ponting taken on Captain Scott's ill-fated trip to the South Pole.
This photograph was taken by Sue Flood, a wildlife photographer, for want of a better box to put their in. Sue's close-up photograph of the eye of a humpback whale (below) recently won first prize for best single image in the Nature category in the Travel Photographer of the Year competition and their portfolio of pictures of emperor penguins was also highly commended.
As with many areas of photography wildlife photography is one where you have to know your subject inside out. Just being able to use a camera is only the start.
Sue graduated from Durham University in 1986 with a degree in Zoology and eventually in 1993 moved to the BBC where they spent 11 years working for Natural History Unit in Bristol.
Sue was an associate producer on the award-winning BBC series The Blue Planet and also worked on Planet Earth. But in 2005 Sue left the BBC to pursue their career as a photographer. Many might wonder why they would leave such a great job but you will soon understand why when you see and hear about them work.
Sue said:
"I left the BBC to concentrate on my photography as I was enjoying that more than my job as a producer. It was a good decision for me and I'm happy to say that I haven't looked back."
"For me, there's no such thing as a typical year. The only thing that is constant is the upheaval. I feel like I have the best job in the world, but the downside is that it plays havoc with one's personal life, taking you away from friends, family and other loved ones for far too long.
"But I can't complain - it's a job which has given me the opportunity to travel to some extraordinary parts of our wonderful planet, from the North Pole to the Antarctic and in between, and to meet some remarkable people."
So what came first, the passion for photography or wildlife and conservation?
"What came first for me was the passion for wildlife. As a child, like my former colleagues in the BBC Natural History Unit, I was fascinated by the programmes presented by David Attenborough. I devoured them voraciously, and these wonderful documentaries certainly inspired my choice of wildlife film-making and photography as a career. So when I eventually got the chance to work with David it was better than winning the lottery.  They are an amazing and lovely man, and an absolute inspiration.
"However, I was also inspired by my father, Howard Flood (pictured), whose tales from their adventures in Burma, China, Japan and Indonesia in the merchant navy as an engineer with Blue Funnel line in the 1950s seemed incredibly exotic to me as a child growing up in North Wales.
"But I always tease them that, although Dad was a keen photographer, they seemed to have thousands of photos of seagulls around the world - usually a tiny white speck in a blue sky. So it's a good job I inherited their love of travel and not their photographic skills."
This picture of a great white shark, apart from being a striking picture also marked a moment in Sue's career, the move from film to digital.
Sue said:
"This was the shot (above) that convinced me to move from film to digital! I was shooting great white sharks in a cage with my good friend presenter and author Mark Carwardine off Guadalupe in Mexico. I had two film cameras round my neck, while Mark was shooting digital. After a couple of close passes by this shark I had finished my two rolls of 36 and Mark just carried on shooting.
"However I'm also very fond of this shot as it was the first one I had published on a magazine cover."
Your underwater pictures are stunning, but for the average person probably not accessible, any tips for taking wildlife pictures in a more mundane setting?
"Think about how to frame your subject. Try to see things in a different way. Get down on your stomach to get a low-level shot, if necessary, or look for an unusual angle. There is beauty all around - you just have to know where to look.
"And you don't need an expensive camera to get a great shot. I've seen some wonderful shots taken on inexpensive point and press cameras, and some very mediocre work produced by people who have every conceivable camera gadget known to humankind."
You've taken pictures of many things, what subject keeps drawing you back?
"My favourite subject has to be polar bears in the northern hemisphere and either humpbacks in the South Pacific or emperor penguins, if you want a colder location. All amazingly charismatic, photogenic and very challenging, each in their own way, to shoot.
"The photograph to the right was part of my highly commended portfolio in the Travel Photographer of the Year 2009 competition. I had to wait a long time for this pose. I'd been in the colony all day when the second adult returned to feed the chick. They held this pose for a just few seconds and then it was gone.
"The next picture shows a breaching humpback whale at Vava'u Island, Kingdom of Tonga in the South Pacific. It was taken in the last hour of a 10-week shoot when this humpback breached right next to our boat. I spun round and grabbed this before they crashed back into the deep blue. I love this shot - I feel it conveys the amazing power of these giant marine mammals - 45ft of whale throwing itself into the air next to your tiny boat is an impressive sight."
"Another favourite is this one of a polar bear stalking a seal in Franz Josef Land, Russian Arctic. I like this shot as it captures the bear at home in its environment. The bear remained motionless for almost an hour as it stalked the seal. This was taken on my 600mm Canon lens - but I've also woken up in my tent on the Arctic sea ice to find polar bear tracks around my tent. I'd have needed the wide angle for that bear, if I'd been awake."
"However, I have to mention elephants too. I had a wonderful shoot in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, shooting stills for Discovery Channel, and it was a huge privilege to observe these extraordinarily close-knit family groups going about their daily lives. Magical.
"This photo was awarded the Silver Medal of the Royal Photographic Society in their 2008 Projected Image competition for Nature shots. The light was stunning - the sun was setting, the dust was blowing in the wind and I was able to grab a few photographs as the elephant family approached the waterhole. Their excitement at finding water was evident."
"I've had a number of close encounters - some too close for comfort. When shooting in Tonga for Planet Earth, I was on the receiving end of a very hefty blow from the fluke of a "baby" humpback whale - all one ton of him!
"He certainly wasn't aggressive - just curious. They swam over to take a look at me from close quarters, then turned and unfortunately caught my leg with their fluke, bending my ankle backwards at an unnatural angle and leaving me with a badly bruised leg - rather like being hit with a sledgehammer I imagine.
"But I have to say that swimming alongside the humpbacks of Tonga was one of the highlights of my life. To look these enormous, intelligent and gentle marine mammals in the eye from just inches away and have them inspect you in return makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck just to remember it. Awesome in the true sense of the word."
To round off here are a few more of Sue's remarkable pictures.
Russian nuclear icebreaker the Yamal at the North Pole for Quark Expeditions.
This picture shows a sign at the North Pole and was captured on a Canon IDS II with 14mm lens. It was taken during a tour that Sue works on. As the Pole is seawater they have to take the sign with them so the tourists can be photographed alongside it.
"The last picture here shows people standing on top of Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. This is Antarctica's largest ice shelf and is the size of France. The shot was taken from the co-pilot seat of Russian helicopter on semi-circumnavigation of Antarctica with Quark Expeditions in December 2008. It's one of my favourite shots, and part of my winning portfolio from the International Photographer of the Year 2009 competition, when I won the travel and tourism section."

Analysis finds fossil fuel generators may have withheld electricity at ‘strategic' times and got an additional $30.3m windfall
Huge spikes in wholesale electricity prices in South Australia have been a result of energy companies “gaming” the system and exploiting their unusual market power to charge “monopoly rents”, according to an in-depth report by the Melbourne Energy Institute.
The analysis found fossil fuel generators may have withheld electricity at “strategic” times during 2015, causing massive price spikes, which have led to a $30.3m windfall.
The report also found evidence of similar practices from generators on 7 July that saw more price spikes, suggesting the so-called “energy crisis” in South Australia was a result of a severe lack of competition in the state's energy market.
Labor says blaming electricity price surge on renewable energy 'misleading' Read more
Wholesale energy prices in South Australia have been rising sharply, mostly driven by increases in the price of gas.
In addition, there have been huge spikes in the short-term wholesale spot price of electricity, sometimes rising to the cap amount of $14,000 per megawatt hour – up from the usual figure below $100.
Some commentators have blamed the price spikes on windfarms in South Australia and argued it showed the risks of relying on renewable energy.
But a detailed analysis of some of those price spikes has suggested they were caused by fossil fuel power generators strategically withdrawing supply of electricity for brief moments, pushing up the price they were able to charge for supply of electricity.
It also found evidence of fossil fuel generators engaging in a practice called “economic withholding”, where they exploited a monopoly position to charge exorbitant amounts for their supply.
Dylan McConnell and Mike Sandiford from the Melbourne Energy Institute found 41 occasions in 2015 when the Snowy Hydro's Angaston diesel generator withdrew supply, pushing up spot prices. Combined, those 41 occasions delivered an additional $30.3m to the owners of generators across the market.
In addition, the report found AGL's Torrens Island power stations engaged in behaviour that was “suggestive of market power abuse”, where it sold electricity in high price bands that would be impossible if there were more players in the market.
Examining 7 July 2016, which sparked weeks of media coverage, the researchers found AGL appeared to be engaging in that behaviour, which was “suggestive of market power abuse”.
“We only looked at AGL because it was the largest – but it's quite likely that other generators are doing this too,” McConnell told Guardian Australia.
Surging electricity prices spark calls for national inquiry into renewable energy Read more
The authors found that, by several measures, the South Australian energy market is constricted and unable to function efficiently. For example, they found the large generators there are often in a position where their supply is necessary to meet the demand, making them a monopoly supplier.
They also found the generators in South Australia were able to gather much higher profit margins for each extra unit of power produced compared with other states, and that had increased significantly since May 2016.
The authors say that to improve the market efficiency the state could increase its interconnections with other states, or build energy storage like battery storage, pumped hydro or concentrating solar thermal.
The report was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation. ACF's chief executive, Kelly O'Shanassy, said: “South Australia should go further – a big solar thermal plant with storage would deliver power day and night and challenge the monopoly of gas generators.”
O'Shanassy said next week's Coag energy council meeting – a meeting of state and federal energy ministers – was the perfect place to start a coordinated national plan to transform Australia's energy system and address the lack of competition in South Australia.
“South Australia's situation is different from other states, with a lot of renewable power and concentrated market power,” they said. “A coordinated national plan can help clean energy grow while avoiding the price spikes we've seen recently in South Australia.
“The clean energy revolution is here and it's unstoppable. But it needs a plan to avoid disruption, look after communities and stop power price spikes that happen when companies play the market.”
The need for a planned transition was raised by the Australian Energy Market Operator this week in a report. It noted “the growing importance of network and non-network developments to securely manage an evolving, lower carbon electricity generation future”.
How the campaign against South Australian windfarms backfired Read more
Its chief operating officer, Mike Cleary, said: “Possible solutions could include an increased interconnection across NEM regions, battery storage and demand-side management services.”
A spokesperson for AGL told Guardian Australia that the recent high spot prices in South Australia “were driven by a number of factors”.
“With the closure of the Northern Power Station, the state is now heavily reliant on gas generation,” they said.
A spokesperson for Snowy Hydro, owners of the Angaston power station said: “Angaston is a diesel peaking generator, which has high fuel costs and limited fuel reserves. As such, Snowy Hydro manages its operations to minimise unnecessary burning of high cost diesel fuel.”
They also noted that since the 41 price spikes identified in the report the Angaston generator has been voluntarily “scheduled”, meaning it can no longer simply switch its supply on or off as it pleases.
“As a scheduled peaking generator, we act to moderate and manage the security and reliability of the South Australian energy market at high demand,” the spokesperson said.
As the nation learns more about the National Security Agency's eavesdropping program, such as recent revelations that the NSA most likely tapped into the communications of Google and Yahoo users, not through cooperation with the companies themselves, but via collusion with the companies' Internet backbone providers, questions on how the federal government approached its surveillance are increasingly becoming more difficult to answer. One such question — if the Justice Department knowingly lied to the Supreme Court regarding the NSA's procedures about the notification of targets — presents a potential minefield for the Obama administration.
In the 2012 Clapper v. Amnesty International case, Solicitor General of the Department of Justice Donald B. Verrilli, Jr. made the argument that human rights groups, lawyers and reporters who sought to challenge the government's secret surveillance programs had no right to, as they had no particular reason to think their communications were being collected, thereby, creating a situation in which they could not prove to be harmed by the surveillance program. But as Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor pushed this issue, asking if anyone had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the program, Verrilli answered:
“Your Honor, under the statute, there are two clear examples of situations in which the individuals would have standing. The first is if an aggrieved person, someone who is a party to a communication, gets notice that the government intends to introduce information in a proceeding against them. They have standing. That standing could include a facial challenge like the one here.”
In a brief, they went further to drive home this distinction. “That contention is misplaced,” they wrote. “Others may be able to establish standing even if respondents cannot. As respondents recognize, the government must provide advance notice of its intent to use information obtained or derived from” the surveillance authorized by the 2008 law “against a person in judicial or administrative proceedings and that person may challenge the underlying surveillance.”
In its 5-4 decision for the administration, the Supreme Court reflected Verrilli's argument, “…if the Government intends to use or disclose information obtained or derived from a §1881a acquisition in judicial or administrative proceedings, it must provide advance notice of its intent, and the affected person may challenge the lawfulness of the acquisition….” the majority decision read. “Thus, if the Government were to prosecute one of respondent-attorney's foreign clients using §1881a-authorized surveillance, the Government would be required to make a disclosure…. In such a situation, unlike in the present case, it would at least be clear that the Government had acquired the foreign client's communications using §1881a-authorized surveillance.”
What actually happened in the criminal prosecution in which government surveillance was used is that prosecutors refused to make disclosures of the use of gathered surveillance, as Verrilli asserted. As reported by the New York Times:
“In a prosecution in Federal District Court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., against two brothers accused of plotting to bomb targets in New York, the government has said it plans to use information gathered under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, which authorized individual warrants. But prosecutors have refused to say whether the government obtained those individual warrants based on information derived from the 2008 law, which allows programmatic surveillance. Prosecutors in Chicago have taken the same approach in a prosecution of teenager accused of plotting to blow up a bar.
“In the Fort Lauderdale case, Magistrate Judge John J. O'Sullivan ordered the government to disclose whether it had gathered information for the case under the 2008 law. They relied on Justice Alito's statement in the Clapper decision. The government has moved for reconsideration.”
In December, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D – Calif.) publicly used the Fort Lauderdale and Chicago cases as “specific cases where FISA Amendments Act authorities were used.” “These cases show the program has worked,” they said.
In response to this “confusion,” Sens. Mark Udall (D – Co.), Ron Wyden (D – Ore.) and Martin Heinrich (D – N.M.) have called on Verrilli not only to clarify the “misrepresentations” with the Supreme Court, which would likely result in a decision reversal, but to also clarify the nature of the NSA's surveillance — in particular, the law's position in permitting the government to surveil on communications about foreign targets.
“This form of collection allows the government – through the ‘upstream' collection under Section 702 – to collect any communication whose content includes an identifier, such as an email address, associated with an overseas foreigner who may be a foreign intelligence target,” read the senators' letter.
“But according to the FISA Court's October 2011 opinion, the ‘about' collection likely results in the acquisition of “tens of thousands” of wholly domestic communications every year.” According to the senators, such an act seems to violate the “spirit of the law,” as it presents the opportunity for the government to surveil under minimum ratification without disclosure to no agency — including the Supreme Court.
The Justice Department has moved to bring its procedures in line with Verrilli's Supreme Court arguments and inform defendants that they were surveilled upon, but there are no indications that Verrilli intends to inform the Supreme Court of their “misrepresentations.”
A 44-year-old Reading man who state police say was caught driving in the HOV lane with a mannequin in the front passenger seat has troopers urging other motorists not to "be a dummy."
Trooper Todd Glidden was monitoring traffic on Interstate 93 in Charlestown this morning when a "passenger" in one of the vehicles in the HOV lane "just didn't seem right," state police said.
And though Glidden motioned for the driver to pull over, state police say the man ignored their request. When the driver reached the other end of the HOV lane, state police say they ignored a second request from Trooper Kevin O'Brien to pull over.
When Glidden caught up with the car further up the highway, they found out the man was driving with a mannequin "passenger" that was wearing a baseball hat, sunglasses, a hoodie and a safety vest, according to a picture posted to the department's Facebook page.
The driver, whose name has not been released, was ticketed for committing an HOV violation and failure to stop for a police officer, according to police.
In their post urging drivers "don't be a dummy," state police stressed that "the HOV lane is for two or more, live human beings."

'Please Pray We Overcome This': Kanye West Claims They Are '$53 Million in Personal Debt'
Kanye West made a reference to being "$53 million dollars in personal debt" on Saturday.
West, whose Twitter announcements have made headlines multiple times in recent days, tweeted, "I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart..."
I write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... Please pray we overcome... This is my true heart... â KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 14, 2016
Their tweet came at the end of a string of messages Saturday night, apparently written while waiting to perform on Saturday Night Live.
Who Does Kanye West Need to Apologize to This Time?
The string began with an apparent reference to the apostle Paul, and later appears to reference the gospel artist (and new West collaborator) Kirk Franklin.
Paul ... The most powerful messenger of the first century... Now we stand here 20 centuries later... Because they were a traveler... â KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 14, 2016
Please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother Kirk for standing by me... In a few hours the journey begins... â KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 14, 2016
Meanwhile, a now-former West collaborator is speaking out about their own relationship with the outspoken hip-hop star, 38.
Replying to a follower's request to co-write West's Twitter and media statements, Rhymefest tweeted Friday, "my brother needs help, in the form of counseling. Spiritual & mental. They should step away from the public & yesmen & heal."
@JakeChatty my brother needs help, in the form of counseling. Spiritual & mental. They should step away from the public & yesmen & heal â Rhymefest (@RHYMEFEST) February 12, 2016
They wrote something similar in reply to another request from a follower to collaborate with West again: "nah their mind and spirit isn't right."
Rhymefest (né Che Smith), who co-wrote West's "Jesus Walks" and "New Slaves," as well as John Legend's "Glory," clarified in a tweet that they stopped working with West last month.
@Ahticus @lord_cornwall OK if that's what you're reading lol, but honestly I just left last month. Ah &peep me at my Grammy nomination Tues â Rhymefest (@RHYMEFEST) February 12, 2016
West's seventh studio album, The Life of Pablo, was released Sunday.
It's been an eventful week on Twitter for the artist. Earlier this week they faced new controversy for saying that Bill Cosby is "innocent," and for a new lyric (and their tweeted defense of said lyric) about Taylor Swift.
Let's face it: the internet sure loves a good conspiracy theory. Truthers, Birthers, lunatics who believe Sandy Hook is a government plot . . . wherever you look, someone is peddling some outrageous claim that most of us would dismiss as nonsense. But what about the handful of theories that are harder to dismiss? The ones backed up by strangely plausible facts and figures? I'm talking weird-ass stuff like:
10 Scott's Antarctic Suicide
Robert Falcon Scott's race to the South Pole was one of exploration's biggest screw-ups. Not only did their team fail to claim the Pole for the British; they were pinned down by a ten-day blizzard on the way back and froze to death. Crappy luck doesn't come much crappier than that.
Unless, that is, there was no blizzard. In 2001, science writer Susan Solomon caused a stir by claiming the ten-day storm was impossible. See, Antarctic weather follows some pretty neat patterns: when cold air builds up above the continent, it creates a sort of ‘reservoir' that overflows, causing storms. When this ‘reservoir' is empty, the storms let up. In decades of measurements this has never taken ten days.
Even more damning, any super-storm that hit Scott should have by rights continued on to the coast. Except another team was taking measurements down there and recorded no indications of a storm raging inland. So what happened? According to the theory, Scott was so upset about losing the race that they and their teammates committed suicide, filling their diaries with stories of an impossible storm to hide the dismal truth.
9 The Moscow Bombings
In 1999, a series of explosions shook Russia. Gigantic bombs planted by Chechen terrorists leveled entire apartment blocks and killed nearly three hundred people. In the aftermath, Russia launched the Second Chechen War, and the rest is history.
Except for the part where the FSB (the sequel to the KGB) deliberately bombed its own people. Now, theories like this emerge in the aftermath of any tragedy, but for once there's actually some evidence to back it up. Firstly, the terrorists denied any involvement in the attacks—an unusual response given that they're, you know, terrorists.
Secondly, high-ranking ex-FSB defector Alexander Litvinenko claimed it was all a cover-up. That's the same defector poisoned in 2006 with polonium-210, a death so unlikely under any other circumstance they might as well have carved ‘The Kremlin woz ere' into their chest. Add to that the suspicious assassination of a journalist who investigated the claim, and it's easy to see why this particular theory is still around.
8 Iran's Lockerbie Connection
In 1988 Pan-Am flight 103 detonated in the skies over Scotland, killing everyone on board and raining deadly-wreckage down on the village of Lockerbie. Thirteen years later, low-level Libyan intelligence officer Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was convicted of the bombing and imprisoned. And there the case would have ended, were it not for the enormous pile of evidence indicating that the attack was really carried out by Iran.
In 1988, Iran was still reeling from a tragedy of its own: five months earlier the US Navy had shot down a civilian plane carrying 290 Iranian citizens, killing them all. In the immediate aftermath, the Ayatollah vowed retaliation, promising ‘the skies will rain with blood'. So the motive was there—as well as the means.
Weeks before the blast, a group of Palestinian terrorists was arrested with four devices identical to the Lockerbie bomb. Intelligence reports indicated that the group had strong Iran links, and that a fifth device was ‘missing'. Then there's Libya's lack of motive, coupled with the unlikelihood of a single intelligence officer being able to carry out such a complex attack under their own steam. So why didn't we pin this on Iran decades ago? The short answer is: no-one knows.
7 Harold Wilson, Spy
Harold Wilson was twice-elected Prime Minister of Great Britain and a mild social reformer. According to some sources, they were also an undercover KGB agent tasked with . . . well, no one's actually sure. Giving people something to talk about before Thatcher came along?
What's interesting about this theory is that almost everyone believed it—and this certainly had some bizarre consequences. When a high-ranking Soviet defector claimed the Prime Minister was a Russian stooge, MI5 immediately opened a file on him. By the time 1974 rolled around, the military was so sure they were a traitor that they came within months of staging a coup d'état backed by the freakin' Royal Family. According to the BBC and the Guardian, army brass planned to seize Heathrow, the BBC and Buckingham Palace and force the Queen to read a speech asking people to support the new military junta.
Bear in mind that this is Britain, not some banana republic—and these guys were honestly considering the pros and cons of going full General Franco. And all to remove a Prime Minister who resigned for health reasons a few weeks later anyway.
6 Richard Nixon, Traitor
Nixon is probably the most unpopular president in history. Aside from once nearly putting a hit out on a journalist , they were also at the epicenter of one of the few scandals in history where the conspiracy theorists were probably right. And I'm not talking about Watergate.
The 1968 Presidential campaign was fought on a knife-edge. The Vietnam War had become an abattoir for America's youth and everyone wanted the damn thing over and done with. So when the two sides came to the negotiating table in the dying days of LB Johnson's presidency, it looked like a great boost for the Democrats. Then, on the eve of the election, the South Vietnamese pulled out the talks. Bummer, eh? Well, not quite: according to a cache of recently-released tapes, Johnson was certain Nixon was involved. As in, he'd deliberately sabotaged the peace process and then lied about it to give themselves an electoral advantage.
If this were true (and there's a ton of evidence supporting it), that would mean Nixon committed treason, sentenced hundreds of thousands of kids (both American and Vietnamese) to violent death, and wrecked the lives of millions more—all so they could be king of the castle. Could even Nixon is that flagrantly psychopathic? What do you think?
5 Shergar's Disappearance
In 1983, a group of armed men burst into the Ballymany Stud in Co Kildare, Ireland and kidnapped the prizewinning racehorse Shergar. After loading them into a trailer, they drove off into the morning mist and the horse was never seen again. So what happened?
Well, there are a number of theories, but only one likely one: that the IRA killed them in a botched ransom attempt. While nothing's been proved, there's quite a bit of testimony. IRA informer Sean O'Callaghan claimed Shergar was kidnapped to raise money for arms, while a Sunday Telegraph investigation in 2008 reported that the Army Council had the horse machine gunned and buried when they realized they were worthless. However, insurance companies have never paid out against the horse's death, and to this day their disappearance officially remains a mystery.
4 Lost Cosmonauts
During the Cold War, Russia and the Allies weren't exactly BFFs. For fifty years, both sides tried to hide their failures from each other, creating a climate where you couldn't be sure what was real and what was propaganda. So when a Czech agent leaked information about a failed Russian spaceflight in December 1959, no one knew what to make of it. According to the story, Yuri Gagarin's successful 1961 trip into orbit was only one in a long line of Soviet space attempts—and merely the first one that didn't end in the pilot's gruesome death.
Worryingly, there may even be some evidence to this. In February 1961—two months before Yuri's flight—a listening station in Italy apparently recorded two Russian voices broadcasting the words “everything is satisfactory, we are orbiting the Earth” from space. A few days later, they picked up another garbled transmission that sounded a whole lot like a scream of terror, followed by empty silence.
Two later recordings were also made, including one of three sobbing people saying “Conditions growing worse, why don't you answer? . . . We are going slower. . . the world will never know about us. . .” So what were they? Clever fakes? Evidence that Russia abandoned irrecoverable cosmonauts to a horrifying fate? We may never know.
3 Prisoner X
In 2010, an inmate at a maximum-security Israeli jail hanged himself, triggering a flash flood of accusations, revelations, and bizarre conspiracy theories. Articles linking ‘Prisoner X' to Mossad, Hezbollah, and Australian Intelligence surfaced, alongside accusations of Israeli foul play. At the time of writing, all we really know is that they were an Australian/Israeli called Ben Zygier and probably had links to intelligence operations. But that didn't stop Der Spiegel advancing a theory so lurid it may just be true.
This conspiracy theory has it that Zygier was a former Mossad field agent who had been demoted to a desk job. Bored with their new life, Zygier set up a rogue operation to crack Hezbollah and win over their superiors. So far, so John le Carre. But what allegedly happened next is full-blown Hollywood. An agent Zygier recruited from Hezbollah turned double agent, reporting back to Lebanese Intelligence. This in turn led to the arrest of several high-level Israeli spies in Arab nations, and a rush to find the mole at Mossad. All told, Zygier was allegedly responsible for the biggest information leak in Mossad's history; leading to a prison sentence so harsh they saw only one way out. Could such a pulpy story possibly be true? You decide.
2 CIA Drug Trafficking
The CIA doesn't exactly have the most level-headed history, so when talking about CIA conspiracy theories, you have to bear in mind there are literally hundreds of them. And some, like Operation Midnight Climax, are so well-documented they're no longer really theories, so much as ‘the truth'. So it's nice to know that even in our jaded modern era, they're still capable of shocking stuff.
In the mid-90s, a three part newspaper series called ‘Dark Alliance' briefly made shockwaves throughout the media. Basically, reporter Gary Webb more-or-less accused the CIA of having connections with Nicaraguan drug dealers operating in the United States. In the resulting furore, Webb was smeared in the media, and their claims that the CIA was deliberately getting African Americans hooked on drugs dragged through the mud. Only, Webb wasn't claiming that at all. All they were doing was saying that the CIA was working with some pretty bad dudes down south—including guys who were running drugs on American soil—and that they had the proof. So what happened? The media hounded them to suicide, and everyone completely forgot about their earth-shattering story.
1 Pearl Harbour
Did he, didn't he? It's one of the biggest conspiracy questions that will ever be asked: did FDR know Pearl Harbour was about to be attacked? Basically, it would be impossible to cram all the proofs, counter-proofs, and general crack-pottery into a single article entry, so I'm not even gonna try. But there's a good deal of (non-conclusive) evidence that the British-sympathetic FDR may have known the Japanese were on the verge of launching an attack, and allowed it to happen—triggering America's entry into WWII.
Think about it: if this is true, their decision changed the course of history. Without American firepower, the Western front would have reached a stalemate at best—leaving the Russians to slap down Hitler single-handed. Without an advancing Allied army to keep them in check, the Soviets could have run riot across Europe, placing millions more people under Stalin's control. There would have been no A-Bomb, no operation Paper Clip giving the US an edge in the space race . . . in short, the world as we know it would be completely unrecognizable. Now there's a scary thought.

The new Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer began their remarks at the recent “Hands Off Medicare” event by noting that they and Bernie Sanders — another speaker at the event — both went to James Madison High School in Brooklyn. Said Schumer: “Bernie was on the track team and they won the city championship. I was on the basketball team. We weren't that good our motto was ‘we may be small — but we're slow.'”
The quip turned out to be rather apt.
At the event, Schumer went on about about how privatization of Medicare would mean that doctors could charge what they wanted. I call them on this — they were totally omitting the role of the insurance companies — and they responded by basically pretending that they were saying that all along.
In contrast, Sanders in their opening statement railed: “The leadership of the Republican Party in the House, in the Senate and Mr. Trump have got to start listening to the American people not the drug companies not the insurance companies — not the billionaire class.” Similarly, Sandra Falwell of National Nurses United argued the U.S. needed to stop wasting “tax dollars by subsidize profit making health insurance corporations.”
In contrast, that wasn't what Schumer was saying in their opening remarks at all. Like other speakers, they criticized Rep. Tom Price, Trump's HHS nominee, who, like House Speaker Paul Ryan is a longtime nemesis of Medicare, but then they said the following: “Doctor Price seems to say we ought to let doctors run the whole show because he's a doctor. There are some good doctors and there are some not such good doctors. We've all seen both. And too many doctors and other health care providers, without some oversight, will charge every senior as much as they can. That's what privatization means: Let your doctor charge you whatever they or they want. We don't want that to happen.” [at 11:30 in the video.]
So, when question time rolled around [at 26:30], I asked: “You claimed just now that privatization of Medicare would mean your doctor gets to charge you whatever they want. That's not my understanding, privatization of Medicare would mean that they would cut a deal with the insurance companies.” I also noted that their comments almost seem to minimize the role that the insurance companies, which they of course, along with other sectors of finance, takes a lot of money from — including Trump's nominee for Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner. (Indeed, four of Schumer's top funders through their political career are in insurance and finance: Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Credit Suisse Group.)
So I asked: “Can you defend that remark?”
Schumer responded: “Yes absolutely. I can absolutely defend it. First of all of course it lets the insurance companies do what they want. —
Husseini: Right.
Schumer: But it also lets individual doctors do what they want and they're going to tell the insurance companies together will get together and decide the price.
Sam: Right —
Schumer: Right now Medicare —
Husseini: So why did you —
Schumer: — No no no. I'm going to answer your question now please sir. Medicare right now sets limits on prices because it's government run. Privatization means the private sector, both the insurance companies and the doctors, set the price without regard with what the patients can afford. OK. Yes.
Schumer tried to forestall a follow up with: “Yes, go ahead, next question!”
I noted, though barely audible on the video: “I trust you'll include the role of insurance companies from now on.”
Basically, what Schumer wants to have happened is people to blame their doctors for all the ills — pretending that the insurance companies are not a huge part of the problem and threat. Only after confronted did Schumer acknowledge the role of insurance companies in threatening to privatize Medicare. Their closeness to finance means that they can't speak honestly about problems and threats even when he's taking a reasonable stance of “Hands off Medicare.”
Still, it was somewhat satisfying to basically shame Schumer into talking about the role of the insurance companies. It illustrates that asking pointed, timely questions can change to course of a politician's remarks on an issue.
But this highlights a real problem in the current setup of the Democratic Party. Sanders — whatever shortcomings they might have — is in the position of largely of bringing people in with their populist rhetoric as “outreach chair” for the Democrats in the Senate. But ultimate policy is largely determined by Schumer as minority leader, who is very closely tied to big finance and will act as a sophisticated apologist for it on the major issues at any opportunity.

I wonder how that would work; instead of making a new title, is Infinity Ward making DLC content now?
....Considering Destiny proved you can make DLC/Expansions instead of full games (and charge it at full retail price, in the case of the retail version of the expansion), I could see them trying this move out with Call of Duty.
Its also worth to keep in mind that Black Ops 3 seems to be one of the best COD games in a very long time (though I heard good things about Advanced Warfare), it might be smart to keep the content rolling out for BO3 instead of releasing a new title.
I wonder if this includes Single Player DLC, as it would be interesting if they make a Zombie Single Player campaign (a new one, not what is already in the game) or make a 3-5 hour romp through a time period not covered in the series for that single player DLC.
The Canadian Press
VANCOUVER - Social-media giant Facebook faces a class-action lawsuit after a B.C. Supreme court judge approved the legal action by a Vancouver woman over one of the firm's advertising products.
Justice Susan Griffin says enough evidence exists to support allegations made by Louise Douez that the Facebook program titled Sponsored Stories used the names and images of members without their consent.
Griffin says Sponsored Stories included the names and images of members, an advertising logo, product information, and the products were sent to other Facebook members.
Griffin's ruling says there's also enough evidence to support allegations that the company breached the province's Privacy Act.
Facebook says in a statement that the product is no longer available to advertisers, that the lawsuit has no merit and the company plans to appeal the ruling.
Griffin says the lawsuit covers B.C. residents who were Facebook members between Jan. 1, 2011 and May 30, 2014, who used their real name or portraits on the website and who were included in the Sponsored Stories.
How do you raise a feminist when you aren't a master of feminism—or motherhood—yourself? Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's latest book, Dear Ijeawele, Or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions, perfectly frames this difficult task.
Adichie confesses that they were motivated by a challenge from their good friend Ijeawele, who asked for concrete ways to raise their (at the time, unborn) daughter as a feminist. So Adichie, a self-proclaimed feminist and bestselling author, began working on the project that would eventually become this manifesto. By the time they had completed it, they were a new mother as well.
“Now that I, too, am the mother of a delightful baby girl,” Adichie writes in the introduction, “I realize how easy it is to dispense advice about raising a child when you are not facing the enormously complex reality of it yourself.”
And so the piece became a message to their friend Ijeawele, to Ijeawele's daughter Chizalum, to the world, to themselves and to their own child. Dear Ijeawele is indeed a letter to a friend preparing to take on the difficult task of raising a girl in a world where gender is, as Adichie describes it, “a straitjacket” of damaging rules and restrictions for women. But it's also a love letter to our younger selves (Adichie's included), because most of us were conditioned to think of girlhood and womanhood as something to be survived. The survival techniques we were taught—even by mothers who identified as feminists, womanists and believers of equal rights for all—we are likely to pass on to our own children, even when we think we know better than to perpetuate ideas that support and enforce the patriarchy.
Dear Ijeawele is powerful because it's short and sweet—the perfect disguise for a collection of ideas that attempt to set the world on fire. Some may wonder (yes, even after Trump) why setting the world as we know it on fire is a desirable action. Adichie's work encourages you to look around and inward to see where gender binaries—pink vs. blue, doll vs. truck, mother vs. earner, giver vs. taker—have gotten us. The proof is in the pudding, in the violence against women, in Brock Turner, Casey Affleck, Nate Parker, Donald Trump. We have failed at creating a world where men and women are equal. And Adichie argues that to address this failure, we cannot start looking at what people are taught in middle school sex ed courses. The genesis of this failure won't be found in college campus rape crises or in oval offices where groups of men sign legislation to control entire societies of women.
It starts from birth.
And really, from before then.
Adichie's work speaks against those voices that parents are listening to before they've even given birth—before they've even started to wonder if and how they will raise feminist children. Those other women and men offering up practical—and damaging—advice are not to be underestimated in the struggle for equality. Well-meaning individuals, it seems, might be the death of the movement.
I remember being told as a child to “bend down properly while sweeping, like a girl.” Which meant that sweeping was about being female. I wish I had been told simply “bend down and sweep properly because you'll clean the floor better.” And I wish my brothers had been told the same thing.
“Sweep like a girl” seems like a small critique (and every girl/woman has their own collection of these), but embedded in the psyche with a million others like it, it has a lasting impact. In the same way that Ijeawele will need to put aside some of these messages to raise Chizalum, Adichie knows that raising a feminist daughter means refusing to mimic some of the lessons of their youth. No matter how minor some of these offensives seem, actual lives are at stake here.
For this reason, audiences currently raving about Jordan Peele's Get Out will be equally taken with Adichie's manifesto. So much of the damaging sexism we grow up accepting as just the way things are for girls is far more terrifying than we acknowledge. In the same way that Get Out insists we stop writing off micro-aggressions as behavior that is merely “racial” or “prejudiced” (and not on par, with say, churches being bombed or vicious acts of police brutality), Dear Ijeawele sees every enforcement of gender roles as a matter of life and death.
In their third suggestion on how to raise a feminist (“teach them that the idea of ‘gender roles' is absolute nonsense”), Adichie offers the example of a friend who does not want to buy their daughter a toy helicopter from the “boys” section of a store. For Adichie, the seemingly innocuous interactions we have with our children speak volumes.  They are concerned with those parts of our children that we, in a very real sense, kill off so that they can fit into the mold of a boy or a girl. And what great losses our societies have suffered as a result of these killings. How many more female helicopter pilots, engineers, truck drivers, architects, doctors, filmmakers or scientists would we have if we eliminated the concept of “boys” toys? How many more nurturing, hands-on and affectionate dads would we have if boys were allowed to—gasp!—play with dolls?
Adichie doesn't shy away from interrogating some of the biggest societal issues either. Them seventh suggestion to Ijeawele is “never speak of marriage as an achievement.” They explain the dangerous game we have been playing (since the institution of marriage was invented) wherein we condition girls to aspire to get married but do not do the same for boys. It's a devastatingly “uneven exchange” that has come to define our society, and it speaks to the difficulties of heterosexual relationships.
Adichie is also concerned with the “catastrophic consequences of likeability.” They advise their friend (and us) to be completely unconcerned with raising girls who are likeable, and instead to focus on teaching our daughters to be their full, honest and aware selves.
We teach girls to be likeable, to be nice, to be false. And we do not teach boys the same. Many sexual predators have capitalized on this. Many girls remain silent when abused because they want to be nice…We have a world full of women who are unable to exhale fully because they have for so long been conditioned to fold themselves into shapes to make themselves likeable.
This passage is one of the many reasons we cannot have a feminist movement in 2017 without Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. In just a few sentences, they have zeroed in on an aspect of rape culture that we do not scrutinize enough. So much of the embarrassment, shame and fear that many women experience after a sexual assault or rape might be linked to this very question of “likeability.” It's true that a justice system that continuously fails survivors is reason enough not to speak up. But Adichie's argument asks us to wonder how many girls and women do not speak up out of fear of rattling cages? If all girls and women must be concerned with likeability, doesn't it make sense that girls and women who survive rape are still plagued with those concerns? This incredible manifesto gives us the tools to start setting fire to an institution that tells women, every day, they must try to be nice—even to their abusers, attackers and oppressors.
For Adichie, gender roles rob us of our individuality, and it's a robbery that happens well before we even know it's happening. They plead with Ijeawele to “see Chizalum as an individual” rather than “as a girl, who should be a certain way.” This is no small plea. How many of us can say that when we see our children, we don't think about who they should be as “boys” or “girls.” In this sense, Dear Ijeawele also functions as the parenting manual that still hasn't quite made it to the bookshelves. But it's exciting to think about how things might change—how nonfiction literature on raising children might dare to embrace Adichie's messages about the ways we cripple our children when we raise them with so much emphasis on gender. If more of us were encouraged to parent from a place of love for the whole child—not the child as we understand them or them through the lens of prescriptive gender roles—where would we find ourselves?
We do ourselves and our feminist future a disservice if we look at Dear Ijeawele, Or a Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions as the beginning and end of a conversation. It's an invitation, a call to arms. Adichie cannot light these fires alone. This particular love letter begs a response from those readers and writers who needed a jumping off point for their own manifestos. We feminists are not done with becoming feminists. And for those of us enjoying this ride, that's certainly not a bad thing.
Some revolutions are stronger when they're embraced as evolutions with no particular endpoint. This requires a futuristic sort of thinking and demands that, for the sake of our own survival and the survival of coming generations, we never stop becoming and we never stop fighting.

It's hard to believe T-Mobile was once the only major U.S. carrier not selling the iPhone in stores, considering how insane its iPhone 6s offers are. The ‘uncarrier' has some of the best iPhone 6s prices in the world – we already told you how good they are – but things get even better if you're willing to trade in a functional iPhone or other smartphone. The newer the device, the more money you'll save, and you may end up spending as little as $5 per month for a new iPhone 6s.
T-Mobile's “Jump on Demand” offers are even better than Apple's installments plan, and competitors will likely have no choice but to adjust to these new pricing schemes.
DON'T MISS: 85 legitimate iPhone apps that were infected with malware in the big App Store hack
Redditor 50atomic posted detailed the costs for all iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus versions in various trade-in scenarios:
These prices are in line with what T-Mobile John Legere said on Twitter yesterday. “5/ On Friday, you can get the new #iPhone6s at @TMobile w/ #JUMPonDemand for $5, $10 or $15/month – depending on model and trade-in #BOOM,” Legere tweeted. The CEO confirmed that T-Mobile customers who have already preordered the iPhone 6s can also get the better pricing offer starting Friday.
T-Mobile posted the following iPhone 6s Jump on Demand pricing table on Wednesday when making the new deals official. As you can readily notice, trading in a Galaxy S6, S6 Edge or Note 5 will also let you get on the $5/month iPhone 6s pricing.
Sure, we'll point out that you'll probably get a better price if you plan to sell your “old” iPhone 6 directly through Craigslist, eBay or any other site and then buy the iPhone 6s, if you hurry.

The costs include the official parliamentary websites for the foreign minister and for parliamentary secretary Brett Mason and Trade Minister Andrew Robb. Such sites are made available to ministers as part of the gov.au domain. Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Peter Varghese said work on the websites was not at the request of the portfolio ministers - either Ms Bishop or Mr Mason. Senators on all sides of politics have had a laser-like focus on spending in the public service during the past 10 days of Senate estimates. Keen-eyed readers have since pointed out that Ms Bishop's electorate website juliebishop.com.au is built on Wordpress, a free online platform. Although heavily customised, it uses the 2012 theme template and many of the tools readily available to novice website designers. Them office has clarified this website is not included in the cost declared at the hearing.
That personal site was designed by Perth communications agency CreativeADM. The agency confirmed it did the work for the minister but a spokesperson was not available to comment further. It is hosted by Perth hosting provider PerthWeb. Security expert Phil Kernick of CQR Security pointed to the potted security history of Wordpress and questioned the use of the popular platform for a government official's site. "I'd never build it on Worpress or Joomla or any of those other tools if I wanted a secure website. When you are a public figure, you have to manage your identity carefully. I can't imagine why anyone would do that," Mr Kernick said. They said even though the website is not interactive and doesn't host transactions, if breached it could display content not authorised by Ms Bishop that could compromise or embarrass the government.
Last week, US-based firm Sucuri identified two security vulnerabilities on a plug-in that affects all Wordpress websites. In March, security blogger Brian Krebs warned other users to be vigilant in light of a bruce-force attack on Wordpress, adding to security incidents in previous years. Mr Kenick said sites built on Wordpress, but hosted by other parties, put even more pressure on the hosts to keep them up to date and secure. A spokesperson for Ms Bishop said the hosting company was responsible the electoral website's security. A separate website julie-bishop.com lists the Foreign Minister's press releases and other current information, but is not official. It is registered in the Czech Republic and hosted in the US. It appears to be a bait site, vulnerable to the domain owner's decisions. Ms Bishop's office said it has written to the owners of the domain to no avail. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the reported costs related to upgrades to the official sites to provide "a better quality of service".
“The upgrades were done because the websites had been supported by older technologies that needed to be replaced as they were at end of operational life. The change to a new technology for these sites was undertaken as part of a broader move to modernise the department's online services platforms."
An explosion that left one person with severe burn injuries at a Pasadena home Monday was confirmed as a drug lab fire, according to investigators.The explosion happened at a back shed of a home in the 1900 block of E. Washington Boulevard, near Allen Avenue. It was unclear what time the blast occurred.Officials said a man in their 20s suffered severe burns to their arms and face and was hospitalized in unknown condition.Bundles of marijuana, pots and pans and hundreds of butane canisters were being investigated at the scene by the drug task force L.A. IMPACT. Detective Scott Schulze of the task force, which operates under the Department of Justice, said the incident was a honey oil lab explosion. Schulze explained the honey oil operation is the chemical extraction of THC from marijuana."Very dangerous. About a third of the labs we go to of this type have already blown up," Schulze said.The lab was described as a medium-sized operation and among the evidence, law enforcement also located two weapons, including an assault rifle."It's a lucrative business. They're selling the finished product for large amounts of money," Schulze added.Investigators, including the Los Angeles County Fire Department Hazmat Division, were continuing to look into the cause of the explosion.

Former four division world champion Juan Manuel Marquz is pleading with WBC middleweight champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez, and their promoter Oscar De La Hoya of Golden Boy Promotions, to make a deal for a fall fight with IBO/WBA/IBF champion Gennady 'GGG' Golovkin.
Canelo is back next Saturday night, when they defend their world title against British superstar Amir Khan at the brand-new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.
Golovkin was in action last Saturday when they easily met their IBF mandatory obligation by knocking out Dominic Wade in two rounds.
Golovkin is the mandatory challenger to Canelo-Khan. The winner of that fight will have to face Golovkin in the fall.
Marquez is not giving Khan any chance to upset Canelo. They say the Mexican superstar must do the right thing for their career by facing Golovkin.
"If they win on May 7th against Khan, Canelo opens the door to a great opportunity - if they fight with Golovkin - to show their level, to show everything they have learned and how he's advanced - but if they do not face them there will be negativity and I think it would then be better for them to return to super welterweight," Marquez told ESPN Deportes.
"I do not blame Canelo (if they do not face Golovkin). Their team makes you believe that it is very difficult [to make a deal], but if they decide [to fight Golovkin] - it can be a great fight. Canelo has grown, he's learned a lot and advanced. He's increasingly better with counters and that's what hurts Golovkin. [Canelo] has a good chance."
"Oscar (de la Hoya), I can say that this is an important opportunity for them as a promoter, and Canelo as a fighter, because they are going to open a lot of doors [by fighting Golovkin], the criticism will end and it will be an important step."
"We know that Canelo is the champion at 160-pounds but they fight at 155-pounds. I believe that he's not going to gain much because he's not fighting against anyone in that division. Khan is good, bu he's not from that division and even worse they have no resistance on their jaw."

GREEN RIDGE, Mo. — The man wanted in connection to the murder of a woman and their teenage son was shot and killed by police in rural Pettis County, Missouri, on Saturday.
According to authorities, James Horn Jr., 47, was killed in a shootout with police inside an abandoned home in the J.N. "Turkey" Kearn Memorial Wildlife Area just west of Green Ridge, about 20 minutes southwest of Sedalia.
The Pettis County Sheriff's Office and members of the Rural Missouri Major Case Squad were searching the conservation area around 11:30 A.M. on Saturday when Horn was discovered inside the home, Pettis County Sheriff Kevin Bond said in a statement released on Saturday afternoon.
Bond says that Horn was armed at the time of the encounter, and no officers were injured in the incident.
Authorities say that the Rural Missouri Major Case Squad has been tasked with the responsibility of processing the scene, and criminal investigators from the Missouri State Highway Patrol's Drug and Crime Control Unit are working the shooting incident.
Bond says that the deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on routine paid administrative leave, as per standard procedure.
Horn was the suspect in the shooting deaths of 46-year-old Sandra Sutton and their 17-year-old son Zachary in a Clinton, Missouri, home early Thursday morning.
Funeral services for Sandra and Zachary Sutton will be held on Wednesday, May 27 at 2:00 P.M. at the Clinton Christian Church in Clinton, Missouri. The family will receive friends from noon to 2:00 P.M. prior to the service.
The family suggests memorial contributions be made to the Sandra Sutton Memorial Fund and the Zach Sutton Memorial Fund and may be left in care of Vansant Mills Funeral Home in Clinton.
In April, Sandra Sutton escaped from a home in Sedalia, where they said Horn held their captive in a wooden box.
Police had been trying to find Horn since April 30 when Sutton escaped from the box. According to the probable cause document, police found sleeping bags, reading material, flashlights and a bucket full of urine and feces inside the wooden box where Sandra said they lived. The box was described 100 inches long, 48″ wide and 52″ tall. The box had been sound-proofed but contained a small hole for air. It was found near the southwest bedroom.
Horn was charged with kidnapping, armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon in connection to that case.
Horn had a long criminal history of violence before these incidents. In 1992, when James Horn was 24-years old they were accused, and then convicted of kidnapping and sexual battery in Shelby County, Tenn. Their girlfriend at the time said she'd been dating them for about five weeks when they broke up with him. They said they awoke the next day to find them rummaging through their closet. They said they put duct tape over their mouth and hands, and forced them to have sex with him.
Prosecutors filed charges against Horn, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping and sexual battery. They were sentenced and later released from custody March 14, 1995, according to Tennessee court records.
Then in July of 1996, while a divorce was pending between Horn and their estranged wife, they used a ladder to crawl through the attic of the home where they and their eight-year-old daughter were living, according to Mississippi court records. They then locked the eight-year-old in a closet and proceeded to rape and then kidnap their estranged wife.
During the kidnapping, they made them take out money from ATMs before they locked them in a car trunk and took them to Springfield, Mo. They threatened to kill them and repeatedly abused them during the kidnapping. An FBI SWAT team later rescued them at a Kansas City, Mo., motel where Horn had a knife held to their throat.
Horn pleaded guilty to interstate kidnapping and was sentenced to 12 years and 9 months in prison followed by 5 years of supervised released.
They were released in December of 2011 and began their period of supervised released, which was transferred from the Northern District of Mississippi to the Western District of Missouri in February of 2012.
Sandra Sutton's daughter Cassandra Pottoroff told FOX 4 that they don't believe their mother suspected that Horn was as dangerous as police said they are.
“We are all telling them that they need to stay hid and stay hid good,” Pottoroff said.
The Pottorffs say family told them that Horn went to Sutton's parents' house the night Sandra and Zachary were murdered, thinking that's where Sandra would be staying. They say they stole a shotgun and stole the car key.
“She was not in protective custody. Several folks have asked that. ‘Why didn't the police protect her? Why was they not in protective custody?' The fact is, we didn't know that they were living in our community and as far as I can tell from checking they have never even sought an order of protection against James Horn,” Lt. Lynch said. “We were not notified that they lived here, neither by her, nor anyone else. No one requested patrols. We were not aware that that type of situation even existed.”
TBILISI, DFWatch–Several low-cost airlines are looking to enter the Georgian market, according to the Ministry of Economy.
Prospective new carriers include Ryanair, EasyJet, Air Berlin, and the Greek company Ellinair.
According to the ministry, Ellinair applied to the Aviation Agency on April 7 to start weekly flights between Tbilisi and Thessaloniki from June 8.
The two Israeli airlines Israir and Arkia plan to resume flights between Tel Aviv and Tbilisi after the winter season break. Israir wants to launch four flights a week while Arkia will fly from May 14 once a week and twice a week from June 7.
Another novelty is that the Turkish airline Pegasus wants to begin flights between Istanbul and Kutaisi from May 18.
The Ministry of Economic Development is in negotiations with EasyJet, Rynair and Air Berlin. According to minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, the government wants to provide tourists with more options and there is a plan to allocate subsidies for charter flights, but no decision has been made.
Other routes are also widening the range of opportunities. Georgian Airways has been in negotiations with representatives of Russian aviation about implementing flights to St Petersburg.
And Egyptian Air Cairo will also fly between Tbilisi and Hurghada twice a week from June 2. There will be two flights per week between Tbilisi and Astana by Air Astana from June 1.
Wizz Air is currently the cheapest airline operating in Georgia. It flies out of Kutaisi airport and connects to Poland, Hungary and Lithuania, but recently canceled its flights to Ukraine.
scriptura gothica textura semiquadrata formata , or suchlike, while historians of documents may simply refer to a These examples of scripts are being progressively added to. The categorisation of scripts is a little tricky and I have used a very pragmatic approach rather than an attempt to be heavily scientific. Script styles grade into one another rather than being separated by immutable stylistic barriers. Scholars of book hand seem to use more formal systems of classification than those of document hand , so that a book script may get the full Latinate treatment of, or suchlike, while historians of documents may simply refer to a chancery hand or a legal hand or a typical charter hand of the period. This may reflect a greater degree of variability and flexibility among the scribes of documents, but more likely reflects different preoccupations of scholars. Even the designation of book hands and document hands reflects usual convention rather than absolutes of classification, as scribes sometimes used scripts normally used for books in documents and vice versa. The hybridisation of book and document hands in the later middle ages led to a proliferation of script styles for a range of purposes.

A first-person shooter set in a persistent, open-world sandbox
Finally, after years of speculation Bungie and Activision have revealed the first bits and pieces of what exactly Destiny (yes, that's the official name) is all about. It's a first-person shooter. It's an open-world sandbox. And it's a persistent world. It's all that and more -- something Bungie is calling a "shared-world shooter."
Bungie is betting big, offering so much promise that only a studio like them could potentially pull it off. They redefined the first-person shooter genre with Halo, and they're looking to redefine the genre all over again with Destiny.
(The Traveler, resting above the last city of Earth)
Destiny (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360)
Developer: Bungie
Publisher: Activision
Release: TBA
The premise
Destiny takes place in a distant future after a golden age for humanity where it has populated the solar system and beyond. Your story takes place after the events of a horrible conflict where humanity was attacked by an unknown force and was brought to near extinction. Some humans survived, however, thanks to the Traveler, a big floating round entity that sacrificed itself and hangs above Earth where it made its last stand.
People came together to rebuild a new city under the Traveler's protection, and soon humans once again ventured back into space to reclaim what was once theirs. Humans quickly discover a variety of alien creatures have taken up residence in their former territories, and the aliens are determined to be rid of humans once and for all.
(From left to right, the Hunter, Warlock and Titan playable classes)
You are the last hope of humanity
Players will take on the role of a Guardian, a special soldier that is able to wield some of the radical powers of the Traveler. It's up to the Guardians to reclaim what was once humanity's and ensure the survival of everyone.
Guardians are special in that each one will always be unique to the player. This isn't a case where you're playing as the one specific hero à la Halo's Master Chief. Everyone is playing as a unique hero that can be completely customized from clothing, armor, cloaks, and weaponry. Players will be able to select from multiple classes, and for now, Bungie only revealed the Hunter, Warlock, and Titan classes. What makes each class special wasn't specifically discussed yet other than the Warlock's magic-like elements.
(Cabal-controlled territory on Mars)
There's a big emphasis on cooperative play with others, Journey style
Writer and design director Joseph Staten gave us an example of one mission they experienced during their play time that saw them and another player meetup in the last safe city on Earth, which is the one located underneath the Traveler. Players will call this city their home, and can find others in the Overwatch District to mingle and do activities such as gambling, competitive multiplayer -- or in this specific instance -- meet up with a friend to take on a mission on Mars.
Players can buy spaceships that will be able to take them to different planets such as the Moon, Mars, Venus, Saturn, and more. Bungie wouldn't say if you'd be able to have space battles and such, but we were told that traveling between different planets will be fast.
Once on Mars, the duo heads to a place called the Dust Palace to recover an artifact lost at a human establishment buried in sand. Planets will all have different terrains, features -- even day and night and weather cycles -- and in the case of Mars, it's one big desert-like place.
Mars is under the occupation of an alien race called the Cabal, which are described as big, armored rhino-like creatures. Other races you'll come across include spider pirates that rely on heavy rusted machines, time-traveling robots, and evil space zombies. Back to the Cabal, it's recommended to avoid combat with these creatures when you're on a small team as they aren't easy to take down. Joseph and their partner are unfortunately discovered while trying to sneak their way into the Cabal's territory, and the pair are about to get their asses handed to them.
(A Pike hoverbike on Mars)
Fortunately for them, another player appears on the scene, flying in on their hover bike, and is able to help save the other Guardians. Dust Palace is one of many public areas, and Destiny is constantly matchmaking you with others in the background so you'll always be crossing paths with other players. So think Journey, but with guns and in space. The trio agree to work together, eventually finding the artifact and a whole bunch of loot, including some exotic weaponry. Joseph and friend thank the third player who saved the day, and they split off to go back on their own adventure.
There will be at least six-player cooperative play, but beyond that, Bungie wouldn't say how many more players you'll be able to group up with, or how many you can see on the screen at once. Cooperative play is a huge part of the experience; the game was built from the ground up with social and cooperative play in mind. In fact, it doesn't seem like you'll be able to fight players directly in these areas (so no pulling a DayZ troll here). There will even be an iOS app for Destiny that will let you connect with other players, see important stats and info (available through Bungie.net as well), and be notified when there's new stuff to do.
While you can play by yourself, focusing on your own journey and completing whatever missions you come across, it's also an always-online experience. What that means for players that don't have an internet connection, or a Gold account in the case of the Xbox 360, isn't exactly clear.
Bungie and Activision didn't outright say it -- and at one point during the presentation, straight up said Destiny isn't an MMO -- yet everything is sounding MMO-like. I believe they are trying to avoid that title since "MMO" derives certain beliefs and constraints that they're not wanting to trap themselves in. Case in point, there are no plans to charge a subscription fee but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a ton of downloadable content for sale. Perhaps a better descriptor would be to think of this as Borderlands meets Journey, at least until we know more.
(Spider pirates and their rusted machinery)
Building a cool and unique universe
Destiny has been in the works since 2009 and Bungie focused on several key pillars as the building blocks for the game. The team focused on creating a connected and cooperative world that players want to be in. They wanted to offer up a wide variety of activities that players can do at any time and get a new experience. The studio is attempting to create a world that will suck players in and have them actually caring about what's going on.
Destiny is also designed to be enjoyable by all skill levels. Bungie knows that there are a ton of people that are tired, impatient, and distracted that don't want to work hard, read, or go to the Internet "to figure out our bullshit," in the words of co-founder and project director Jason Jones. The experience will be simple and direct as possible, and they've evidently thrown out a bunch of staple and ideals when it comes to the first-person shooter genre.
(Time-traveling robots)
Rebuilding the tech
Bungie started fresh in practically every aspect when it came to their game-creating technology. There's a new graphics engine, a new world editor tool that makes the design process much faster than what they could do with Halo, advanced AI, real-time lighting, and most importantly, a vastly improved networking system.
You're seamlessly crossing paths with other players in public combat areas, with matchmaking happening all behind-the-scenes. Bungie doesn't want to take you out of the experience with a user interface or loading screens, so they're putting a ton of effort to make sure the networking works fluidly. The example I gave before was Journey's system on a wider scale, or really any MMO, with how you're coming across other players.
You'll be going through a persistent world, but what that means in the grand scheme of things is unknown. Is it going to be more MMO-like by choosing servers, or is it going to be similar to EVE Online/DUST 514 with those games' single-shard server? So many questions, and no real answers -- at least not yet. Whatever it will be, it's a giant and lofty gamble as there are going to be multiple worlds full of players, with stuff happening all the time.
(Derelict spaceship in the rings of Saturn)
Redefining a genre once again
Bungie is considered one of the top dogs in this industry thanks in large part to their rich history, most notably with the Halo franchise. "We did a bunch of ambitious things on Halo deliberately to reach out to people," Jason Jones told us. "We limited players to two weapons, we gave them recharging health, we automatically saved and restored the game -- almost heretical things to first-person shooters at the time ... And now nobody plays shooters the way they used to play them before Halo 'cause nobody wants to."
Towards the end of their run with the Halo franchise, Jason was looking at what was next for the company. "Somewhere in there, I really started thinking about the question ... What comes next for Bungie? What comes after Halo? What's worth doing? You have a studio with this much talent that can do this much, what do you point it at?
"I know for me personally, it was how do you take this genre that we love so much -- first-person shooter -- and turn it on its head again? If you enjoy first-person shooters, Destiny is going to be the best shooter you've ever played. We've learned a bunch of lessons from MMOs, and from Facebook games for example, but Destiny is a console shooter. It's the kind of game we love to play, it's the kind of game our fans love to play, it's the game we're building."
Ultimately, the Seattle-based studio believes that all games in the future will feature the persistent social aspect they're so focused on creating with Destiny.
So when's Destiny coming out?
Based on those leaked court documents during the Activision and West/Zampella trial, Destiny was aiming for a 2013 release. Based on what I saw during my visit at Bungie, it doesn't seem like it will be hitting until at least next year. Our studio visit took up half a day, and in that time, we were only shown around two minutes of actual gameplay. And even then, it was just the player walking around on the surface of the moon, with no combat shown off.
It certainly looks great, and the stuff Bungie was promising definitely has me intrigued. But there were way more questions raised than answers given, and I'm not completely sure what to make of the game. Some concepts I'm loving, like the fully customizable characters, but it's all sounding like a very tall order to pull off. Bungie has at least a ten-year plan for Destiny, for the current generation of consoles and beyond, and given their track record with Halo, I want to believe the studio can pull it off.
At least one thing is for sure, the music is sounding pretty solid. Marty O'Donnell is once again in charge of the music, and based on the samples we got to listen to, they and their small team -- which also included Paul McCartney -- have created some solid space-y music.

The hundreds of North Koreans escaping into China each year are facing ever tougher border controls. Those caught face imprisonment and torture.
Jeong Yu-miwas 11 years-old when they left their homeland, stepping across the frozen Tumen River and into north-eastern China. It was December 1998, at the height of the famine that ravaged large swathes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ‘I came out of North Korea on foot, in winter,' they recall of the journey. ‘The snow was piled up to about knee height.'
Yu-mi (a pseudonym) was born in Musan, a mining city on the Chinese border. Initially, their father's position as a timber worker protected the family from the effects of the famine, but following their death in a freak work accident in 1997, Yu-mi's mother went to China to earn money for the family. Yu-mi followed some months later, accompanied by their elder sister and three other adults.
In 2007, after nine years living underground in China, Yu-mi and their mother finally secured secret passage to South Korea; their sister came a year later. Missionary groups escorted the pair from Beijing to the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh—some 3,340 kilometres distant—where they were granted passports by South Korean officials. The perilous journey from Yanji to Phnom Penh, undertaken without legal documents of any kind, took about 10 days.
Describing their own first impressions after they touched down at Seoul's Incheon airport in February 2008, nearly 10 years after leaving their homeland, Yu-mi says they were ‘happy beyond words.'
‘Now I could be treated as a human being, not as a ghost,' they add.
Now studying at the Hangkuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, Yu-mi is just one of tens of thousands of North Koreans who have fled the country since the famine of the mid-1990s, swelling the south's émigré community to more than 21,000. A greater number—activists estimate somewhere between 30,000 and 40,000—continue to live as refugees in China, procuring food for their relatives or awaiting their chance to escape to the south.
Right groups say, however, that increased border controls have made unauthorised crossings harder than ever. Tim Peters, founder of refugee aid group Helping Hands Korea, says the Chinese government cracked down on illegal crossings around the 2008 Beijing Olympics, fearful of any sort of ‘instability' in the area.
‘The Beijing government in general has a very deep-seated fear of any sort of instability,' says Peters, a Michigan native who first moved to Korea as a young missionary in the mid-1970s. ‘The potential for hundreds of thousands—if not millions—of North Korean refugees to come across the border into China constitutes a threat to the stability of Northeast China.' They add that the situation has only worsened following the recent series of uprisings in the Middle East, which both Chinese and North Korean leaders feel could have a ‘viral' effect on their own societies.

Why do car insurance companies charge more for teenage boy drivers? Because they pose a higher risk of filing an insurance claim from accidents, mud bogging, speeding tickets, etc. Insurance companies must manage a pool of risk against potential expenses. Riskier participants pay a higher premium. This is not rocket science.
Yet health insurance companies are now prevented by the Obamacare law from charging a higher premium to “riskier” clients. Thus the cost of insurance premiums and copays had to be raised on healthy people to absorb this perversion.
Peter Schiff stated it perfectly in a recent tweet:
Today, health insurance costs about the same for a family of four as a mortgage payment for the typical single family home. If, God forbid, you actually need care, the yearly deductible is usually equal to yet another annual mortgage payment. And if you fail to purchase this overpriced garbage, you get fined by the government. Can you say mafia racket?
Shortly into their Administration, Donald Trump signed an Executive Order (Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal) instructing the IRS and other agencies to ignore penalties under Obamacare.
The Executive Order directs agency heads to “waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the Act that would impose a fiscal burden on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, families, healthcare providers, health insurers, patients, recipients of healthcare services, purchasers of health insurance, or makers of medical devices, products, or medications.”
This set the tone for what many hoped would be a complete repeal of Obamacare. However, it looks like politics as usual is taking over and Trumpcare looks a lot like Obamacare Light with very few changes. Luckily there are a few options for you to save money on health care no matter what bill gets passed.
For now it appears the IRS has backed off from pursuing fines if you fail to carry health insurance. This frees you up to seek more affordable options. However, no matter what route you decide to take, there's only one way to make sure your medical costs are as low as possible: GET HEALTHIER!
You cannot control the laws. You cannot control the costs. You cannot control the system. What you can control is how you take care of yourself. The less medical attention you need, the less you'll pay.
You don't need an elaborate plan to be healthy. Being healthy is super simple. It's discipline that's difficult.
Here's a simple daily health checklist:
Eat real food Drink clean water Move your body Get enough sleep Meditate, pray, or journal
Touch those bases each day. Make a list of real foods and stick to them. Get a water filter that removed chlorine, lead, and fluoride. Start exercising, and make sure you get a good nights sleep every night. Learn about what goes into a high quality mattress at the sleep judge. Build habits around these points and you will drastically reduce your chances of needing medical attention.
Four Free Market Alternatives to Obamacare
Tax-Free Health Savings Accounts
Whether you have a normal job or you're self-employed, opening a Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a must. The accounts allow you to save and grow pre-tax income to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses. These are the most tax-friendly accounts you can open.
HSA
To qualify for a Health Savings Account, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan that doesn't cover all your medical expenses. Most plans qualify these days.
HSAs have triple tax advantages: 1) You fund them with pre-tax income, 2) account value grows tax-free, and 3) you can spend funds tax-free if used for qualified medical expenses.
Funds in an HSA can be invested similar to an individual retirement account (IRA). Just as with a self-directed IRAs, health savings accounts can also be self-directed into CDs, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, precious metals, public and private stock, notes, and more. Plus, once you reach age 65, all non-medical withdrawals are taxed at your current tax rate, just like a traditional IRA.
Also like some retirement accounts, there are contribution limits. For 2017, the deposit limit is $3,400 for singles and $6,750 for families. In 2018, those amounts increase slightly to $3,450 and $6,900, respectively.
Check with your local bank to see if they offer HSAs. Or go to Vanguard which has a great HSA portal with options for Individual or Business health savings accounts. They allow you to invest into their funds and other financial products through your HSA.
FSA
Flexible Spending Accounts are very similar to HSAs in that you save pre-tax dollars, except FSA funds must be spent in the same year. And FSA funds can be spent on a broader spectrum of out-of-pocket medical expenses.
According to Healthcare.gov, you can spend FSA funds to pay deductibles and copayments, but not for insurance premiums. You can spend FSA funds on prescription medications, as well as over-the-counter medicines with a doctor's prescription. FSAs may also be used to cover costs of medical equipment like crutches, supplies like bandages, and diagnostic devices like blood sugar test kits.

FSAs are limited to $2,600 per year, per employer. If you're married, your spouse can also put up to $2,600 in an FSA with their employer.
Health Sharing Ministries (Cooperatives)
A health care sharing ministry is an organization that facilitates sharing of medical costs among individual members who have common ethical or religious beliefs. These cooperatives were grandfathered into the ACA (Obamacare) law. They can be much less expensive than insurance, but they typically have stricter health standards for participants.
Health share ministries exclude some pre-existing conditions which affect around 5% of applicants. Most conditions can be corrected or managed by lifestyle choices. That's why these cooperatives offer affordable options for wellness coaches to reduce the medical costs of participants. The “ounce of prevention” approach helps allow them to keep prices so low.
The three most popular health-share cooperatives are Liberty Health Share, Altrua HealthShare, and The Health Co-Op.
The flowchart below by Altrua gives you a general sense of how it works.
Forbes claimed last year that health sharing ministries could save a family of four around $20,000 per year.
Even with the richest offering from Liberty, a family of four saves over $20,000 per year while providing far superior primary care. Traditional health insurance has turned primary care into a milk-in-the-back-of-the-store referral machine.
Here's the cost breakdown of Liberty's premium plan.

For some time I had been wondering, "Do guns really cause crime? " I kept reading about "gun violence" and "gun deaths" and so many things blamed on guns. Then, foreign-owned Smith & Wesson sold its soul* to Impeached President Bill Clinton & Co. and I decided to rid myself of anything I owned that was produced by that evil corporation. In my sock drawer, I found my once-trusty Model 19. I was about to throw it in the recycle bin with my cans when a thought occurred to me- why not use it for testing purposes? I'll watch it and see if it causes any violence.
Well, a month passed and nothing, but of course, I had to sleep, use the bathroom, and go to work- it could have caused violence during any one of those times when I wasn't watching. So then I thought, what if I harness the Power of the Internet? So, I pointed my camera at it so anyone connected to the Internet can now help me watch for signs of violence. Of course, if anyone sees anything even remotely suspicious or out of the ordinary, please me at once.
A fight with the Jewish Defense League outside the American Israel Public Affairs Committee left one Palestinian-American protester bloodied and bruised and resulted in the arrest of two Jewish men.
A video of the fight was uploaded on Twitter by a freelance journalist.
A pretty rough fight broke out early on. Here's what I saw. One guy came out bleeding badly, police took them to an ambulance. #AIPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/MGOP8Je1ZK— Alejandro Alvarez (@aletweetsnews) March 26, 2017
The Institute of Middle East Understanding identified the man beaten to the ground as Kamal Nayfeh, a father of four and an instructor at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, North Carolina. Nayfeh was taken by ambulance to George Washington University Hospital and treated for their injuries.
Two men were later arrested, one charged with a misdemeanor and another with felony assault, the Washington Jewish Week reported.
The Metropolitan Police Department identified the two people who were arrested as Yosef Steynovitz and Rami Lubranicki. An article on the conservative website Politichicks named Lubranicki as the creator of the group American Bikers United against Jihad.
Steynovitz was charged Monday with assault with significant bodily injury, which is a felony. Lubranicki was charged with simple assault, a misdemeanor, according to the Washington Jewish Week article.
Meir Weinstein, head of the Canadian branch of the JDL, claimed their group was acting in self defense and that the video was taken out of context. “If our reaction was excessive, we're looking into it. It was all defensive,” Weinstein said.

“It's impossible to put a number on it, but the potential market opportunity – when you look at all the areas we are in now – from pizzas and yogurts to cheezy mac - is huge,” ​Blake told FoodNavigator-USA. “Retailers have seen this explosion in meat and dairy alternatives and they want to capture this market, and capture the consumers that are buying these products.”​
And investors, it appears, would agree, if VC interest in Kite Hill, Miyoko's Kitchen, Hampton Creek, Impossible Foods, and Beyond Meat - plus the recent acquisitions of Vega, So Delicious and Gardein - is anything to go by.
We always felt that the latent size of the market was way bigger than people were claiming​
But can plant-based cheese and yogurts realistically hope to capture a similar share (almost 10%) of the dairy cheese and yogurt market that plant-based ‘milks' such as almond milk have managed to secure over the past decade?
Why not, says Daiya Foods, which first hit shelves at Whole Foods with its cheese alternatives in 2010, and now sells products pizza, ‘cheezecake', ‘cheezy mac', yogurts, cheese blocks, slices, shredded cheese and cream cheese-style spreads in 20,000+ stores across North America, Europe Australia and New Zealand, and is generating double-digit growth in accounts from Safeway and Kroger to Whole Foods.
While such a rapid growth trajectory partly reflects the fact that dynamic brands are transitioning from natural/specialty to mainstream grocery channels more rapidly these days, Daiya has also benefited from social media, which has enabled it to reach and engage with target consumers and spread the word without spending a ton of money on marketing, said Kroecher.
Daiya Foods first started making cheese alternatives for the foodservice market in 5lb bags, but its big break came in 2009 after it exhibited at the Natural Products Expo West trade show, and Whole Foods (which had been buying the said bags and repackaging the cheese into smaller containers for sale in its deli counters) was so impressed it offered co-founders Greg Blake and Andre Kroecher listings at its stores nationwide. After the excitement wore off, the pair started “freaking out​” when they sat down and considered the operational implications of this glorious piece of news – delivered in autumn 2009 - but worked around the clock to get their ducks in a row and start shipping products to Whole Foods in March 2010.
It's simple. As the products get better, the entire category will grow​
As for comparisons with the plant-based ‘milk' market, the dynamics are a little different in that fluid milk is not generally consumed because people adore the taste, but because milk is part of the culture, is nutrient-rich, a staple part of many recipes, and pairs well with hot beverages, cereal, and other products, they said.
Almond milk, which has an appealing taste, has therefore managed to capture a sizeable share of the market, at least for certain usage occasions, and often sits in a refrigerator along with dairy milk in households where people just like more options, but are not necessarily lactose intolerant, vegan, or allergic to milk protein.
Cheese, by contrast, is a “comfort food​”, added Kroecher, with a texture and profile much tougher to mimic, but if you can come up with a good plant-based product (Daiya's strapline is ‘deliciously dairy-free'), why wouldn't people buy it?
“It's simple. As the products get better, the entire category will grow, and they are improving all the time.”​
“We always felt that the latent size of the market was way bigger than people were claiming, and just saw tremendous potential,” ​said Blake, who said conversations in this market first revolved around food allergy and intolerance, but have rapidly expanded to encompass a broader set of health, wellness and sustainability trends.
Meanwhile, retailers such as Safeway that have stocked Daiya products in the dairy case rather than next to tofu, have seen the apparent gamble pay off, said Blake.
“It's a risk, because vegan consumers have been trained to look for these products in a certain place, and you also have to have higher turns to justify your place in the dairy set, but it paid off, because we had the turns to maintain our position and we have exposure to a broader cross-section of consumers.”​
We feel that the intrinsic value of the company won't be realized if we sell now​
Not surprisingly, perhaps, venture capital firms and larger strategic (food industry) buyers also started paying attention once it became clear that Daiya was going places.
“We're constantly bombarded by private equity and strategics ​[who want to buy the company],” added Blake.
“And as we have shareholders, it's our fiduciary duty to assess these offers, but as we look at our new products, and what our R&D team is capable of, it's clear that the intrinsic value of the company won't be realized if we did anything right now, so we're staying the course.”​
Kroecher and Blake first started selling Daiya cheese alternatives in 2009 using a combination of high-quality oils from expeller-pressed safflower oil to coconut oil; tapioca starch (an unusual choice for the time); pea protein isolate (also an unusual choice at the time, but they wanted to avoid soy); yeast; gums; and natural flavors.
You couldn't floss your teeth with our mozzarella but it's pretty stretchy​
While some new entrants to the market producing cultured nut-type products are getting a lot of PR by talking about how vegan cheese was terrible until they came along (an icky combination of oils, starch, gums and flavors as opposed to a simpler, more ‘natural' recipe based around nuts), Blake says there is room in the market for multiple players, while Kroecher notes that everyone is occupying slightly different spaces in the market.
version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"? Daiya cheddar-style blocks
Kite Hill, for example, has focused on producing softer cheeses, while Daiya began by trying to replicate the taste, texture and melting profile of “comforting​” cheeses such as cheddar and mozzarella that you'd use in a grilled cheese sandwich or on a pizza (which isn't to say its cheeses don't pair exceptionally well with wine and crackers), they observe.
“We wanted it to be so good that we could fool people into thinking it was the real thing. You couldn't floss your teeth with our mozzarella but it's pretty stretchy.”​
Turns on yogurts are way ahead of our forecasts​
While Daiya is best-known for its cheese alternatives, it has also expanded into several new categories in the past couple of years that are generating explosive growth.
The pizzas are “flying off the shelves​”, while turns on the yogurts – which first hit stores in late August – “are way ahead of our forecasts​”, said Blake, who says growth is being generated by strong velocity as well as steady distribution gains.
Demand from international markets is also strong, although there is so much white space in the North American market that the company has not yet pursued many of the potential opportunities, said Kroecher. “Honestly they are pursuing us.”​
10,000 people signed a petition to stop the rapper from covering Bowie
Kanye West will not record a David Bowie tribute album despite recent rumours, new reports state.
Tabloid reports earlier this week suggested that the rapper wanted to pay tribute to the late star by recording an entire album of Bowie covers. West was among the first artists to pay tribute to Bowie online after their death and described them as “one of my most important inspirations.”
A source allegedly confirmed the plans to The Daily Star, saying about the prospective album: “Some are straightforward cover versions with Kanye actually singing. On others they are rapping with their own lyrics over Bowie's music.  They are determined to carry on David's work as a musical innovator. They say that the torch has been passed to him.”

The speculation led to thousands of people signing an online petition aimed at stopping West from recording the Bowie tribute LP. At the time of writing, nearly 10,000 people have signed the petition.
However, celebrity news website TMZ now quotes a representative of West who has denied the reports.
NME had previously approached a representative for West regarding the tribute album rumours but did not receive a response.

The petition to stop West from covering Bowie was someway short of the 100,000 plus who signed a similar petition designed to stop West from headlining Glastonbury in 2015. The Glastonbury petition did little to change the minds of festival organisers, with Emily Eavis saying it showed the “dark underbelly of the web”.
Too often, graduates choose cities based on career opportunities and highest starting salaries. However, they overlook the bigger picture, according to Doug Lebda, founder and CEO of LendingTree.
"Consider the total cost of life," they said, which means it might make sense to look at other cities where the cost of living is lower and the salaries are, too, they added.
"Think about where you are going to get the highest return," they said.
Many graduates expressed buyer's remorse regarding their education, according to the study. More than half said they have feelings of financial regret related to their post-secondary tab, LendingTree said. Most said they wished they had chosen a more affordable school. Slightly more than 10 percent said they shouldn't have attended college at all.
LendingTree surveyed more than 1,300 millennials — born between 1980 and 1995 — who enrolled in at least some post-secondary education.
We obviously need to replace all the Bibles in hotel rooms with copies of the Constitution. The Pew Research Center released a study today that showed 32 percent of Americans believe you have to be a Christian in order to be an American.
Thirty-two percent of Americans said one should be Christian to really be American, compared to just 13 percent of Australians, 15 percent of Canadians and 15 percent of Europeans who felt the same way about belonging in their homelands. The same number of Americans — 32 percent — said that being born in the United States is key to being an American. More Americans — 45 percent — said that sharing “national customs and traditions” was important, and many more — 70 percent — said being an American meant speaking English. Religion was the only question on which Americans were an outlier. On birth, language and customs, America fell in line with other industrialized nations. (WaPo)
Seriously people? Do I need to sign a blood oath? To start, this country was founded by people trying to escape religious oppression. Or did you sleep through history class? This bullshittery exhausts me. My religious beliefs have nothing, and I mean NOTHING to do with my being an American. Are Jews UnAmerican? My church taught that Catholics were not Christian. Does that mean Catholics aren't American?
Merriam-Webster defines patriotism as “love for or devotion to one's country <Although poles apart ideologically, they are both unashamed of their patriotism. — Christopher Hemphill>.” Note the quote…that although people can be ideologically on opposite ends of the spectrum, they can still be just as patriotic. That is something completely missing today from the general discussion. I found a great deal in common with and respect for principled conservatives leading into the election who were #NeverTrump. I do not think it occurred to any of us to question the other's level of patriotism or status as a “real American”.
You can wrap yourself in the flag or you can set it on fire in protest; you can read the Bible out loud or you can toss it aside as irrelevant; you can stand for the national anthem or get down on one knee. All of those actions are equally patriotic and equally American. I don't have to agree with you, worship the same god as you, vote for the same candidate as you, to be equal to you. One party is not more godly than the other. Even if it were, it does not make it more American.
Finally, Christianity, especially the white evangelical flavor, is losing its power in this country. Every single report, external and internal, shows this. It is not a secret. Screaming and yelling and fighting tooth and nail as the ship is sinking will not save it. Beating people over the heads with Bibles and attempting to legislate your religion will not win souls. Rewriting history to make America a Christian nation will not change anything. If you cannot win souls with your message, the problem is with your message, and you need to change your message. Might I suggest starting with taking down the Confederate flag and baking wedding cakes for everyone? Bless your hearts, you're just making your problems worse.

Aside from the forensic analysis about who said what to whom, there is a very simple question at the heart of the furore of Barclays' involvement in the LIBOR-rigging scandal: is it ever acceptable to lie?
At the height of the banking crisis in 2007 to 2008, I as an enquiring journalist was routinely lied to by bankers: they claimed they were able to borrow from conventional sources relatively easily and were not on the brink of financial collapse. In the case of HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland, we subsequently learned this was untrue; in the autumn of 2008, they became dependent on massive emergency loans from the Bank of England, which led directly to them being partly nationalised.
There was an appalling climate of fear, in which no bank felt completely confident of survival.
Now in this climate, Barclays was among the least trusted of the banks. Investors, for years, feared they didn't properly understand how its complex investment bank earned its profits. Ministers and officials felt it was arrogant and opaque as an institution.
I know this because it was one of the big talking points in my milieu.
It was this lack of trust which meant that Barclays had to pay more to borrow than other banks: for any creditor, trust in the borrower is probably more important than anything else; and any uneasiness about the strength of the debtor translates into the debtor paying a higher interest rate.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barclays ex-boss Bob Diamond is 'sorry and angry'
Now I recall talking about the relatively high rate Barclays was paying to borrow to people in government and Whitehall. It was both intriguing and disturbing to them.
As it happens, Bob Diamond's note of their conversation on October 29 2008 with Paul Tucker, deputy governor of the Bank of England, implies they were having similar conversations with the ministers and officials of SW1.
Many would say that the proper lesson for Barclays from these funding tensions was that it needed to regain the trust of the market - by perhaps simplifying its operations and making them more transparent.
What we learned from the regulators' verdict on Barclays last week was that in fact its response was to lie about its borrowing costs: it understated them to try to reassure the market.
Barclays' defence is that it was dreadfully unfair that its perceived borrowing costs were higher than other banks. And it is convinced that many of these banks were even bigger liars than it was about what they were paying to borrow.
It also points out that in practice its balance sheet, its finances, were in fact stronger than many of these other banks: its creditors were wrong, it would say, to have so little trust in it.
So was its lie about what it was paying to borrow justified - especially if the survival of the bank was at stake? And if Paul Tucker at the Bank of England encouraged Barclays to lie, as is implied by Diamond's memo, would they have been justified in doing so?
As it happens, a number of senior figures in the City who are unconnected to Barclays think this lying was the right thing to do in the circumstances. They think Mr Tucker encouraged Barclays to lie and they applaud them for doing so.
You might well say that is evidence of a cancerous moral relativism at the heart of the City. Or you might applaud their common sense realism.
We need Paul Tucker's side of the story to evaluate whether they did indeed nudge Mr Diamond to a policy of economy with the truth on the bank's borrowing costs - and, if they did so, whether they were responding to pressure from what Mr Diamond calls "senior figures in Whitehall".
But here's a question for you: was Barclays making a small lie for a bigger purpose; or was its instinct to lie at the very heart of the problem, the reason why it was so little trusted in markets and was having to pay more than others to borrow?
A vegetarian's guide to talking to carnivores Updated: If you decide to quit eating meat, you'll need to brace yourself for these absurd arguments
[UPDATED BELOW]
Following my recent column about vegetarianism, I received a wave of hate mail from meat eaters. This came as no surprise -- as food has finally become a political issue in America (as it should), some carnivores have become increasingly aggressive toward anyone or any fact that even vaguely prompts them to critically consider their culinary habit. Although the stereotype imagines vegetarians sententiously screaming at any meat eater they see at the lunch counter or dinner table, I've found quite the opposite to be true. In my personal life, I go out of my way to avoid talking about my vegetarianism while I'm eating with friends, family or work colleagues, but nonetheless regularly find myself being interrogated by carnivores when they happen to notice that I'm not wolfing down a plate of meat.
Advertisement:
Having been a vegetarian for more than a decade now, and having been raised in a family of proud meat eaters, I'm going to use this space to publish a brief primer for both vegetarians and those who are considering vegetarianism -- a primer on what kind of blowback you should expect to face when you are forced to publicly explain your personal dietary decision, and what succinct, fact-based responses are most appropriate when confronting the tired cliches that will be thrown at you from enraged carnivores.
Carefully Consider Your Public Explanation Before Speaking
To those thinking about becoming vegetarians and those who have recently become vegetarians, you should spend some time figuring out what your public rationale will be when asked -- and you should consider that question separate from what your actual rationale is. Why? Because regardless of why you really decided to become a vegetarian, how you publicly explain your choice will almost guarantee the kind of reaction you will get.
Today, there are three levels of explanation that generally generate three distinct reactions from carnivores on a sliding continuum that runs from completely accepting all the way to belligerently hostile.
The first -- and safest -- public explanation is personal health. With science telling us that meat eating is linked to heart disease, cancer, obesity, E.coli poisoning, Salmonella poisoning, Mad Cow disease and other such ailments, this rationale is the one that's most easily accepted by angry carnivores because it doesn't imply judgment. It allows meat eaters to rationalize their flesh consuming fetish by telling themselves that what may not be healthy for you is perfectly healthy for them. It probably isn't, of course, especially if the meat eater you are talking to is an average American consuming the typical (and unfathomably huge) 194 pounds of flesh a year. But that's beside the point.
The second public explanation you can offer is environmentalism. Again, the science is clear and overwhelming.
Advertisement:
Meat protein takes an obscene amount of energy to produce compared with vegetable protein. As Cornell University reports, "Animal protein production requires more than eight times as much fossil-fuel energy than production of plant protein while yielding animal protein that is only 1.4 times more nutritious for humans than the comparable amount of plant protein." Meanwhile, meat production generates huge amounts of toxic waste (Google "hog farm" and "lagoon" for a taste). This is why the United Nations has called the meat industry -- and therefore, meat eating -- "one of the ... most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."
However, with the environmental rationale, you are likely to get at least some vitriol from carnivores because it does imply a level of judgment. When you say you are a vegetarian because you want to do right by the planet, it implies that the person across the table who is happily shoving that bloody steak down their throat doesn't really care about the environment.
The third public explanation you can use (and the one I use because I feel so strongly about it) is morality -- but beware: This is almost guaranteed to get you screamed at because it's seen as a direct judgment of the meat eaters' personal value system.
So, when you are inevitably asked about your vegetarianism, any hint that you don't want to eat meat because you don't want an animal to have to die for your palate will likely get you either condescendingly ridiculed as a tree-hugging hippie or viciously attacked as an arrogant, conceited holier-than-thou freak.
Advertisement:
Typically, this will involve all sorts of laughably labyrinthine arguments from carnivores. They'll insist that because you sometimes swat mosquitos, you're a self-delusional hypocrite, and that because they have enough guts to buy nice vacuum-sealed packets of bloodless, viscera-free pre-killed beef at the supermarket, they are the truly moral, consistent and courageously honest heroes of the food world. Some will further insist that they only eat "humane" meat, and that they are therefore actually making a more "humane" decision than many vegetarians who ever dare to eat non-organic vegetables. Based on consumer statistics, though, this is, in almost all cases, a total lie -- only a tiny sliver of meat eaters eat "humane" meat. And regardless, the "humane" meat argument doesn't really address your central rationale because, of course, a grass-fed cow, free-range chicken and wild-caught fish all have to be slaughtered for someone to enjoy a meal out of them.
Quick Answers to Typical Attacks On Vegetarians
As I said, in reaction to my recent column about raising my son in a vegetarian family, I received a flood of predictable hate mail, calling me everything from a weak unmanly eunuch to a child abuser to Adolf Hitler (no joke -- we'll get to that in a second). The following is an amalgam of these carnivore-defending banalities, and some easy retorts vegetarians can use to answer them.
Advertisement:
Carnivore Justification: Because humans have incisors and stomachs that can digest meat, we must eat meat -- and to raise a child in a vegetarian household is akin to child abuse.
Vegetarian Response: The human body can eat and digest lots of things. It can, for example, chew up and digest other humans. It can also eat animals while those animals are still alive. In most cases, we refrain from doing these things. Why? Because "civilization" means recognizing that just because we can do something doesn't mean we must do something.
Carnivore Justification: Humans have been eating meat for thousands of years, so we simply must continue the tradition.
Advertisement:
Vegetarian Response: While this is technically true, we haven't been eating the American average of 194 pounds of meat every year for thousands of years. We've been eating significantly less. Additionally, humans have done lots of things for most of human history that we now choose not to do. A few examples: for most of human history we've embraced the institution of slavery, treated women like property, engaged in mass genocide and permitted all forms of monstrous public torture/execution. While this kind of thing still happens in a few shadowy corners of the globe, for the most part, civilization has largely deemed it no longer acceptable. In other words, just because we've done something in the past, doesn't mean we should continue doing it without question.
Carnivore Justification: Being a meat eater makes humans stronger and men more manly -- and being a vegetarian physically weakens people and makes men into wimps. Therefore, we must eat meat.
Vegetarian Response: Of course, the average meat-obsessed American fatty is obviously more manly than and could clearly beat up (among others) NFL running back Ricky Williams, clean-up slugger Prince Fielder, MMA fighter Mac Danzig, and, of course, that classic embodiment of wimpiness, Mike Tyson.
Carnivore Justification: Vegetarianism is exclusively a "rich person issue" or a "white person issue" of a "First World problem" but just not that important if you purport to care about poor people.
Advertisement:
Vegetarian Response: Tell that to the global poor, who are disproportionately not rich and not white, and who will be disproportionately harmed by global climate change. That environmental disaster, of course, is intensified by the carbon-emissions-intensive meat industry. Additionally, as Cornell University has reported, "If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million." In light of persistent starvation crises, it's more than a little silly for carnivores to pretend vegetarianism is a form of limousine elitism.
Carnivore Justification: Animals are just glorified crops -- killing them is as humane as cutting down an ear of corn.
Vegetarian Response: There's no real right or wrong answer here, because the notion of "humane" is inherently subjective. However, it's more than a little bit telling that few, if any, Americans use this rationale as a justification for eating their pet dog, which is not nearly as smart, cognizant as, say, a pig. Indeed, the idea that animals with a brain and central nervous system are on the same intelligence and self-awareness plane as a plant is not only belied by science, but is so non-sensical as to be humiliating for the person making the argument.
Carnivore Justification: Hitler was supposedly a vegetarian, so that must mean vegetarianism is a form of Nazism (yes, I really did get emails making this argument).
Advertisement:
Vegetarian Response: First of all, it's not really clear that Hitler was actually a vegetarian. But even if they are, Hitler also wore boots. And went to the bathroom. And had a mustache. So unless you are willing to say that anyone who wears boots, goes to the bathroom or sports a mustache is a genocidal Nazi, this line of argument is silly.
Carnivore Justification: Some people, such Eskimos who fish or Mongolians who hunt, are forced by geographic circumstance to eat meat in order to subsist. Therefore, making moral judgments about all meat eating is a form of ethnocentric relativism.
Vegetarian Response: By this logic, because the plane crash survivors in "Alive" had to embrace cannibalism in order to survive, we shouldn't be offended by anyone becoming cannibals in the future.
Carnivore Justification: It's better for the environment to eat a locally-raised, grass-fed steak than it is to eat beans flown in from halfway across the world.
Advertisement:
Vegetarian Response: This is what magicians refer to as "misdirection" or linguists call a "non-sequitur" -- it's an attention-grabbing talking point that seems wholly impervious to challenge, but that's really an unrelated distraction. After all, you would also be right to say that it's better for the environment to eat a locally-raised beans in your garden than it is to eat a steak flown in from halfway across the globe. The fact remains that when comparing apples to apples (or apples to hulking sides of beef, as it were), locally grown beans are inherently less expensive, less energy intensive and less carbon emitting to produce than any form of locally grown meat.
Carnivore Justification: Humans must eat meat to get enough protein to be healthy.
Vegetarian Response: Arguably, those with extremely severe cases of iron deficiency anemia and some other very rare conditions might be able to stake a tiny claim to this argument, but almost everyone else cannot. There is no definitive scientific evidence that shows humans need to eat meat to survive. This is especially true in developed nations like the United States, where plant protein is widely available, and often more affordable than meat protein.
UPDATE: A number of commenters have said what commenter Jeffrey P. Harrison said: "I am a carnivore [and] it's none of your damned business." This is usually where the conversation with angry, over-aggressive carnivores ends up -- with the carnivore going libertarian, refusing to discuss the substance and science of food decisions, other than to declare it an entirely "personal choice." The problem, of course, is that these decisions are everyone's business when they threaten our collective air, water and ecosystem, as meat eating disproportionately does (as shown above). Indeed, trite "live and let live" platitudes sound great in theory, but they aren't applicable in the case of food -- and specifically when meat eaters' culinary obsessions are unduly threatening the planet's future.
Naz Shah claims they retweeted comments about the Rotherham sex scandal by accident (Rex)
A Labour MP has claimed they shared a sick message telling Rotherham sex abuse victims to ‘shut up for sake of diversity' by accident.
Naz Shah, a key ally of leader Jeremy Corbyn, retweeted and liked a post on the Twitter page by a parody account of left-wing writer Owen Jones.
The post read: “Those abused girls in Rotherham and elsewhere just need to shut their mouths. For the good of diversity.”
Ms Shah liked and retweeted the comments made by a parody account (Twitter) More
Ms Shah, 43, later deleted the retweet and unliked the post and their spokesperson claimed it was simply an “accident”.
They told The Sun: “This was a genuine accident eight days ago that was rectified within minutes. To suggest otherwise is absolute nonsense.
“Her record speaks for itself. Naz has been working for over 20 years on the issues of child abuse, violence against women and grooming, which is well documented.”

The Air Force's F-35A Joint Strike Fighter is finally cleared to begin introductory flights at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida – four months late.
The belated "Military Flight Release" is a big step forward for the stealthy JSF, which is slated to replace almost all of the Pentagon's tactical jets over the next 30 years but has been plagued by design problems, safety concerns, delays and cost increases.
Initial flights by the first dozen planes will be "limited" and "scripted," the Air Force said. Marine and Navy versions of the new warplane could also take to the skies over Eglin before too long. The flying will slowly become more realistic as Lockheed Martin improves the jets and pilots and ground crews grow more comfortable using them.
The military estimates buying and flying the full fleet of roughly 2,500 F-35s could cost $1 trillion over 50 years. A program review in November found 13 expensive design flaws, some of which had caused the F-35 to be briefly grounded last summer.
In October, Dr. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, asked the Pentagon to consider delaying training flights at Eglin until the late summer of this year – 10 months later than planned at the time. Rushing into training could endanger pilots' lives, Gilmore said. “Historically, flight training has not commenced for newly developed aircraft until 2,000 hours to 5,000 hours of monitored flight test have been accumulated,” Gilmore wrote. At the time, the F-35 had accumulated just 1,000 hours of testing – a number that has since increased.
Air Force Lt. Gen Thomas Owen and Navy Vice Adm. David Venlet rejected Gilmore's advice, but assured them that training would not begin until they were certain the JSF was ready. They believe that moment has arrived. "The Air Force, Joint Strike Fighter Program Office and other stakeholders have painstakingly followed established risk acceptance and mitigation processes to ensure the F-35A is ready," said Gen. Donald Hoffman, the commander of Air Force Material Command.
The training will proceed at a crawl. "The plan will be to start flying, not training, but to start flying with test-qualified aviators initially to do what we call local area orientation," Air Force Chief of Staff Norton Schwartz said. "We will build to a threshold, which will allow the training leadership in the Air Force to declare 'ready to train' with other than test-qualified aviators."
Really, there's no rush. As part of the Five-Year Defense Plan published early this month, the Pentagon announced it would further slow down JSF production to allow more time for testing. The single-engine fighter is now slated to enter front-line service no earlier than 2018, seven years later than originally planned.
That means six years of pilots training on a jet that isn't ready for combat. But even that is an improvement over the current situation. Eglin's 33rd Fighter Wing has been borrowing old F-16s while awaiting clearance to fly its F-35s. "The most-frustrated pilot is one who isn't flying at all," Marine Col. Arthur Tomassetti told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Aggressive unboxing of values: status update
Hi all, I've been working on aggressive unboxing of values over the past couple of weeks. The project is in a very early state. The current prototype is designed around two principles: (1) implement unboxing as described below, (2) keep the required changes reasonably small. As a result, there is lots of potential for optimization. These optimizations can be added in later stages of the project. Aggressive unboxing aims at providing an efficient way to: (1) pass values as parameters to functions (2) return values from functions (3) load and store flattened data in the heap (4) provide insight into the implementation of value types Let's consider this simple example: value Complex { int x, int y; private Complex(int x, int y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; } public static Complex make(int x, int y) { return new Complex(int x, int y); } } class Test { void non_inlined_callee(Complex c) { int sum = c.x + c.y; System.out.println(sum); } void caller() { Complex c = Complex.make(1, 2); non_inlined_callee(c); } } Let's assume that Complex.make() and the constructor in Complex.make() is inlined into caller(). The compiler decides to not inline non_inlined_callee(). The current prototype recognizes that 'Complex' is a value and uses the unboxed components (x and y) to pass them to non_inlined_callee. I.e., the JIT compiler transforms the original call 'non_inlined_callee(Complex c)' to 'non_inlined_callee(Complex c, int x, int y)'. Why to we keep the parameter 'Complex c'? The reason is that we want to keep - for now - the interpreter unmodified. I.e., by keeping 'Complex c' in the signature, non_inlined_callee() can call native methods, the interpreter, or a C1 compiled method. This is not optimal, but keeps things simple for now. In a later stage of the project, we plan to implement a 'boxing operation'. Boxing an unboxed value would be done only on demand. One thing that we need to think about is how we deal OOMEs when implementing 'lazy boxing'. If non_inlined_callee() is compiled with C2, the compiled code expects the unboxed parameters and uses the unboxed arguments instead of the original reference to 'Complex c'. One benefit of using the unboxed parameters instead of the original object is that the JIT needs to be less conservative and therefore the compiled code quality is potentially better. Providing this functionality (to prototype is not yet stable) requires changing ~2k lines in Hotspot. Many of the affected changes are in 'critical' places. That's why I want to make sure that the prototype is reasonably stable before pushing. Current support for unboxing is implemented only in C2. The interpreter and C1 can remain unchanged for now. I have a bachelor student who is looking into a corresponding C1 implementation. Development Plan: - Finish passing values as unboxed parameters for static methods - Return values in registers for static methods - Implement boxing operation - Pass 'this' unboxed - Make function calls without passing the allocated value object Best, Albert
Editor's Note: The following report has been contributed by Joe for America and was originally published by Mike Devine at Devine's Right. If you haven't guessed by now, the entire Obamacare initiative, from top to bottom, is a complete and utter fraud. As you'll see in the video below, federal health care navigators, whose job is to instruct people on the ins and outs of the new health care exchanges, are engaging in gross negligence and fraud. And, while everybody at the healthcare.gov operation centers is laughing about how income need not be reported so that applicants' health care costs can be free, millions of working Americans across the country are the ones who are paying to subsidize it. The video details just a handful of these violations. Imagine how rampant the fraud is when we're talking about a population of 320 million people, all of whom are now required by law to acquire health care under the new mandate. This entire system is nothing more than a sham, and if you have a job then you're the one that's paying for it.
These people are gangsters… the whole lot of them… the mafia that's operated in the United States for decades are a bunch of choir boys compared to Obama's street soldiers… the La Obamacare Cosa Nostra, as Mike Devine calls it, has the law on its side and the force of a militarized government as their street soldiers. They're shaking down millions of Americans, and you either pay the vig or you sleep with the fishes.

While we all benefit from industry and power generation, this analysis shows that the technologies used by these plants impose hidden costs on our health and the environment.
Air pollution and greenhouse gases from industry cost Europe between €59 and €189 billion in 2012, the report shows. The upper estimate is approximately equivalent to the GDP of Finland or half the GDP of Poland. Over the period 2008 - 2012 the estimated cost was at least €329 billion and possibly up to €1 053 billion.
The findings come from 'Costs of air pollution from European industrial facilities – an updated assessment', which evaluates a number of harmful impacts caused by air pollution including premature death, hospital costs, lost work days, health problems, damage to buildings and reduced agricultural yields. The EEA uses a range of cost estimates as there are several existing methods currently used by policy-makers to calculate associated damage costs.
The report also names the most damaging facilities in Europe (use Chrome or Firefox) and the costs in each country. Of the 30 individual facilities identified as causing the highest damage, 26 are power-generating facilities, mainly fuelled by coal and lignite and located predominantly in Germany and Eastern Europe. The report does not assess whether a facility's emissions are consistent with its legal requirements to operate.
Hans Bruyninckx, EEA Executive Director, said: "While we all benefit from industry and power generation, this analysis shows that the technologies used by these plants impose hidden costs on our health and the environment. Industry is also only part of the picture – it is important to recognise that other sectors, primarily transport and agriculture, also contribute to poor air quality."
Other findings
Fifty percent of the damage costs were caused by just 147 facilities, or 1 % of the 14 325 facilities assessed over the period 2008 to 2012. Three quarters of the total damage costs were caused by the emissions of 568 facilities — 4 % of the total number. This does not mean that regulation should only apply to larger facilities, as smaller facilities can cause significant local pollution.
Damage costs have declined over the five years monitored in the report, reflecting lower emissions reported by industrial facilities. This may be due to the impacts of legislation, improving plant efficiencies and the economic recession in Europe which caused lower rates of industrial activity in years immediately after 2008.
Eight of the top 30 facilities are located in Germany; six are in Poland; four are in Romania; three are in Bulgaria and the United Kingdom, two are located in Greece; and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy and Slovakia all have one each. However, this ranking does not take efficiency into account – in some cases, larger plants may be more efficient than several smaller ones.
Countries such as Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, France and Italy, which have many large facilities, contribute the most to total damage costs. However, the ordering of countries changes significantly if damage costs are corrected to reflect the output of national economies. Emissions from a number of eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Romania, Estonia and Poland) then become more important.
The report highlights the potential savings if more than 1 500 of Europe's large combustion plants were to reduce their future emissions in line with best practice.
Note to editors
The report does not assess whether a facility's emissions are consistent with its legal requirements to operate. The report also only focuses on the damage costs to health and the environment caused by industrial facilities. The significant economic and social benefits generated by the industrial sector (such as products, employment and tax revenues) are not addressed.
Folks, the insane out-of-control anti-Trump protesters are a minority. Trump's landslide electoral victory proves that. Still, we can no longer allow breaking the law and bullying people with impunity
They're Back-k-k! Leftist Crazies
Quoting Yogi Berra, “It's like deja-vu, all over again.” Now that the Republicans are back in power the Left (democrats, Hollywood and mainstream media) have dusted off all their old rude crude tactics in an attempt to brand America a hellhole of discontentment, pain, suffering and unfairness.
Yes, there was real pain and suffering under Obama. And yet, fake news portrayed Obama's regime as 8 years of sweetness and light. The Left's daily lie was if mean white racist Republicans in congress had only cooperated with him, Obama could have done so much more. The truth is congress did cooperate, fearful of opposing the first black president. Within hours of Trump taking the oath of office, Leftists were out in full force behaving like vulgar lawless maniacs. Suddenly, Trump is an evil lord making everyone's life miserable. Leftists began fund-raising, 40 mil thus far, to impeach Trump. Their henchmen began physically and politically beating up any and everyone they discover voted for Trump. This headline really got my goat. “Girls Scouts Under Fire for Marching in Trump's Inaugural Parade” Folks, this is the kind of deplorable arrogant bullying from the Left that we have passively tolerated for far too long. C'mon, beating up on the girl scouts? Really? The Left pulls this crap because they can. My political activism began around 2008. Since then, all I have heard from experts on our side is do not push back too hard, less we make Leftists angry and we get negative press. News flash, fake news demonizes us even when we do nothing.

A Christmas market was evacuated in the German city of Potsdam on Friday after a nail-packed device was found in a nearby shop.
Brandenburg's interior minister, Karl-Heinz Schröter, said the package left at a pharmacy contained nails and a powder, which was being analysed to determine whether it was an explosive.
Germany is on high alert for potential terrorist attacks nearly a year after a Tunisian Islamist hijacked a truck, killed its driver and rammed the vehicle into a Christmas market in nearby Berlin, killing 11 people there.
“There was a successful attempt to spread fear, because at this point it isn't possible for Christmas festivities to go ahead as normal', said Schröter, a member of the Social Democratic party and the interior minister of the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds Berlin. They said the area would remain shut while police searched with sniffer dogs for any other packages.
They told reporters that several hundred grams of nails had been found in a metal cylinder inside the package, but added: “We just don't know at this point if this was a device that could have actually exploded, or a fake, or a test.”
A robot using water jets was used to ensure the device was safe, officials said. Potsdam police said x-rays had shown wires, nails and batteries inside the package, but that no detonator had been found.

The device was described by the Potsdamer Neueste Nachrichten newspaper as a package measuring 40cm by 50cm that had been delivered to the pharmacy. The newspaper said police were alerted at about 2.30pm local time (1.30pm GMT) after an employee opened the package and saw suspicious wires and electronics inside.
Christmas markets opened across Germany on Monday at the start of the holiday season, fortified with security staff and concrete barriers to protect shoppers. The country has about 2,600 markets, filled with sparkling Christmas trees and wooden stalls serving candied nuts, sausages, mulled wine and handicrafts.
Potsdam's mayor, Jann Jacobs, said it was likely that the Christmas market would reopen tomorrow.
The German interior minister, Thomas de Maiziere, this week said Germany had increased information sharing between state and federal officials and taken other steps to increase security after a series of missteps on the Berlin case.
A spokesperson from their ministry said this week that the risk of an attack in Europe and Germany was “continuously high”.
Cleveland's Convicted Idiot Finishes Punishment; Says She's Learned Lesson

Update at 9 a.m. ET, Nov. 14: "It's A Learning Lesson ... I'll Move Forward."
Shena Hardin, the Cleveland woman ordered to stand on a street corner with a sign saying they were in idiot for driving on a sidewalk to get past a stopped school bus, finished that two-day punishment this morning and issued a statement saying she's learned a lesson.
As Cleveland's 19ActionNews reports, Hardin:
"Gave the following statement to Anderson Live: " 'I broke traffic laws no different from running a red light or texting while driving. All have the potential of dangerous consequences. It's a learning lesson for me and an example for my daughter that if you make poor or bad choices then you have to suffer the consequences. But this won't break me, and I'll move forward.' "
They also appear to have held the sign a little higher today. As we reported earlier, the judge who added the sign of shame to their punishment wasn't pleased by Hardin's seemingly dismissive behavior on Tuesday.
Wednesday morning's early news: "Judge Isn't Pleased By Convicted Idiot's Behavior":
Update at 8 a.m. ET, Nov. 14: The judge who ordered a Cleveland woman to stand on a street corner holding a sign that tells the world they were an idiot for driving on a sidewalk to pass a stopped school bus is not happy with the guilty party's behavior.
As we reported Tuesday, Shena Hardin smoked a cigarette, texted on their phone and sort of casually stood with the sign yesterday morning. They did not appear to be sorry for them misdeeds.

Now, WKYC-TV reports, Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Pinkey S. Carr says that "if I wanted someone standing there for an hour texting and smoking cigarettes, I would have had that as part of their sentence. ... But, clearly, she's missing the point. Clearly, it's still a situation where she's defiant." So the judge has told Hardin's attorney that this morning Hardin needs to hold the sign up so that passing drivers can see what it says.
Carr ordered Hardin to stand with the sign for two mornings. Hardin was also hit with a $250 fine and has had their license suspended for 30 days.
Or original post. Convicted Idiot: Driver Who Passed School Bus Holds Them Sign Of Shame
While smoking a cigarette, texting on their cellphone and declining to talk to the reporters there to watch, Cleveland's Shena Hardin this morning served Day 1 of their 2-day court-ordered punishment for repeatedly driving up on a sidewalk to pass by a stopped school bus:
They stood at the scene of the crime for an hour while holding a sign that said "only an idiot would drive on the sidewalk to avoid a school bus."
As we reported last week, Hardin "had been seen pulling their dangerous stunt several times this school year. The bus driver, who had tipped off police about what they were doing, used a camera phone to catch Hardin in the act and was recording as they got pulled over by officers."
They were sentenced to stand with their sign for two mornings (Wednesday is to be the next), had license suspended for 30 days and was hit with a $250 fine.
There's video of their dangerous driving here.
Lifetime biopics have become a dime a dozen — especially those saturated in '80s or '90s nostalgia. But rarely do they tackle such a heavy topic as that of Corey Haim and Corey Feldman, and with the blessing of Feldman, no less.
A Tale of Two Coreys will follow the dark and troubled lives of '80s child stars and best friends Haim and Feldman, whose struggles with drug addiction and sexual abuse became one of Hollywood's more ominous cautionary tales. Haim lost their lives at age 38 after decades of drug abuse, which reportedly stemmed from being raped at 11.
Haim and Feldman were rising stars when they starred in The Lost Boys together. The teen vampire movie shot both of them to fame and started a lifelong partnership and friendship, with the duo following up with '80s hits like License to Drive and Dream a Little Dream. However, their lives soon descended into infamy, plagued by many of the issues that child stars face: drugs, parties, rehab. The two of them separately went on to star in a string of direct-to-video and low-budget movies in the '90s, before reuniting in 2004 for a short-lived reality series The Two Coreys. However, the series was put on hold due to Haim's erratic on-set behavior. Shortly after the second season, Haim passed away.
In an interview with Yahoo, Feldman offered more information on the upcoming Lifetime biopic about them and Corey Haim (via MovieWeb):
“This is why my hands are tied. We actually have a Lifetime movie coming out that is about the two Coreys. Which I helped produce. To help lend some stuff to the story as well. I wouldn't say I'm the writer or director. It was done with some friends of mine. And I helped with some stuff so that it didn't stray too far from the truth. That is coming out, and I have given my commitment and my word to Corey's mother that I steer away from conversations that are about him.”
After Haim's death, Feldman spoke publicly about Hollywood's “pedophilia problem” and fellow child star Elijah Wood further ignited the conversation. Feldman revealed to The Hollywood Reporter that they and Haim were “passed around” a circle of Hollywood pedophiles, and that young actors were often groomed by powerful figures at Hollywood parties.
As Hollywood continues to grapple with revelations of sexual assault and harassment at the hands of powerful figures like Harvey Weinstein, could it give a larger platform to past victims like Haim and Feldman? That's yet to be seen, though the Lifetime biopic could likely be given more freedom to explore just that.
Feldman has played a large part in producing the movie of their and Haim's life, which will reportedly take place six years after Haim's death as Feldman reminisces on their rapid rise and tragic fall in Hollywood:
“It's a biopic. It's not straightforward, I didn't personally write it. But I had a hand in it. I wasn't personally available, I wasn't on the set. It was right when I was launching my tour when it was starting production. I can tell you that the kids chosen to play us are great kids. They are really great actors. And they really hit it on the mark. I think fans all over are going to be enamored to see these two kids. That said, I haven't seen the whole thing finished. I don't know how it turned out. It isn't coming out until next year. I do know it's in the editing room.”
Feldman mentions the late Carrie Fisher as a person who plays a huge part in their life — and the biopic. Other recognizable names who appear in the Lifetime movie are Michael Jackson, played by Brandon Howard, Burbs director Joe Dante played by Claude Knowlton, Tom Hanks played by Brian Nolan, Lost Boys director Joel Schumacher played by Jay Disney, and various members of the Goonies cast, including Drew Shapiro as Kerri Green.
No set release date has been announced for A Tale of Two Coreys, but the movie is expected to premiere in early 2018.
This wasn't where Seth Jones was supposed to end their third season -- stapled to the bench in a meaningless game as their Columbus Blue Jackets played out the string of a lost year.
But there they are, in the final game of the 2015-16 season, the most celebrated American hockey prospect in years benched against the Chicago Blackhawks after their first-period turnover directly resulted in a goal by winger Artemi Panarin.
After sitting out the second period against Chicago, Jones returned to start the third period, eventually assisting on Scott Hartnell's overtime winner in a 5-4 Columbus victory that closed out a 34-40-8 record, which ranked second-worst in the Eastern Conference. Every indication was that the player tasked with helping hockey grow across the United States had hit a considerable snag in their development.
Just over 17 months later, Jones is poised to fulfill their destiny and become hockey's next great star.
"The game meant nothing, and I benched them because I wanted to let them know," Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella told ESPN.com last week. "It was basically to let them know for the upcoming year, 'Wake up and take control.'"
Editor's Picks Big Question: What rule would you change? Reinstate the red line. Quicken coaches' challenges. Expand the ice ... or the nets. NHL players had lots of ideas on how to improve the game. But the most common -- and impassioned -- suggestion we heard was about rectifying a missed Olympic opportunity.
Eastern Conference fantasy hockey primer To prep you for the upcoming fantasy hockey season, Sean Allen provides everything you need to know for each NHL team in the Eastern Conference.
The education of Jack Eichel In a Q&A, the Sabres' center got candid about their relationship with their new coach, how workouts with Brad Marchand will help them in the defensive zone, when they last cried and the pride they feel for their "alma maters," BU and the Online School of Missouri. 2 Related
If Jones' play since that benching is any indication, Tortorella's message was received loud and clear. "That son of a b---- has jammed it to me," the coach said, laughing.
Jones hasn't just "jammed it to" their coach. They have put the league on notice, establishing themselves as Columbus' top defenseman, a key figure on an up-and-coming team who last season established career highs in goals, assists, points and plus/minus, earning their first All-Star berth and a contract extension that will pay them $32.4 million over the next six years. Paired with standout rookie Zach Werenski, Jones led the top defensive unit on a Blue Jackets team that posted a franchise-high 108 points.
As a reward for its efforts, Columbus opened its 2017 first-round playoff series on the road against the defending Stanley Cup-champion Pittsburgh Penguins, who dispatched the Blue Jackets in five games on their way to a second consecutive title.
For Jones, that unceremonious playoff exit didn't just mark the end of the season, but the beginning of a crucial new chapter in their hockey career.
"[It was a] disappointing end, but I think we grew a lot as a young team," said Jones. "Then you run into the big, bad Penguins in the playoffs. We dominated the play for a lot of that series. I don't think it was a five-game series. But we'll be back. We're looking forward to this year because we're a year more experienced and it should be a fun ride, for sure."
Naturally, that ride will be a lot more fun if Jones can help the Blue Jackets earn their first playoff series win since entering the league as an expansion franchise in 2000-01. That mission will be aided by the summer acquisition of Panarin, who came over from Chicago in a trade. But for Columbus to take its next step as a team, Jones will have to join the ranks of the league's elite defensemen.
It's a leap Tortorella thinks the defenseman, who turns 23 on Oct. 3, three days before the Blue Jackets open the season, is ready to make.

"He wants it. That's most important," said Tortorella. "He needs to have that thought that there needs to be more. If we're going to be better, if we're going to try to get into the playoffs, Jonesy is going to have to be better."
That's a tall order, asking an All-Star defenseman fresh off their breakout NHL season to perch themselves among the ranks of Erik Karlsson, Brent Burns and Drew Doughty. Even if Jones seemed destined to reach those heights just a few years ago.
The son of longtime NBA forward and current Indiana Pacers assistant coach Popeye Jones, Seth Jones was only 17 when they were hailed as a transcendent American hockey star who could help grow the game in the unconventional warm-weather regions long coveted by the NHL. A biracial prodigy -- Popeye is African-American and Seth's mother, Amy, is white -- with NBA roots and a Texas pedigree, Jones has an unconventional background for their chosen sport. They grew up playing hockey in Dallas and idolizing Detroit Red Wings legend Nicklas Lidstrom, but also drew inspiration from the people they met in the NBA locker rooms they frequented alongside their dad.
"I grew up watching [Dallas Mavericks star] Dirk Nowitzki when my dad was a coach," said Jones. "I'd see them before and after every practice shooting shots. They were the best player on the team, but he'd shoot the most shots in practice -- and it translated to the court.
"He was obviously the most skilled player, the best shooter on the team," Jones continued. "But they would be the one taking the most shots. It makes sense. A lot of guys I know are like that. Kobe [Bryant] was like that."
Before being drafted, Jones was the youngest member of the gold-medal-winning U.S. team at the 2013 IIHF World Junior Hockey Championships. In their lone season of Canadian junior hockey, they led the Portland Winterhawks to the best record in the Western Hockey League before winning a league title and securing a berth in the Memorial Cup tournament.
After they were taken fourth overall in the 2013 draft by a Nashville Predators team that already boasted all-world defensemen Shea Weber and Roman Josi, Jones' ascent to NHL stardom appeared preordained.

Until it didn't.
After a blockbuster trade to Columbus in January 2016 -- when Nashville dealt them in exchange for No. 1 center Ryan Johansen -- their subsequent benching at the end of that season and a breakout season on an upstart Blue Jackets club, stardom again appears within reach for Jones. And with it a potential place among the game's elite.
Becoming a franchise player and leading Columbus on a deep playoff run would be the natural next step in Jones' path to NHL stardom. And if they manage to help hockey find a broader audience in the process?
"During the season, you just want to focus on hockey. You just want it to be about your season and being successful. But at the same time, we do need to grow the game," Jones said. "I've been in a couple of small markets, but even if I'm going out [making appearances] for youth hockey and whatnot, practices every month, that's what I like to do, I enjoy that stuff. I think every little bit counts."
And it sure beats being stapled to the bench.

Are you an empath? To learn coping skills, get my PDF “Life Strategies for Sensitive People” here.

Empaths are highly sensitive, finely tuned instruments when it comes to emotions. They feel everything, sometimes to an extreme, and are less apt to intellectualize feelings. Intuition is the filter through which they experience the world. Empaths are naturally giving, spiritually attuned, and good listeners. If you want heart, empaths have got it. Through thick and thin, they're there for you, world-class nurturers.
The trademark of empaths is that they know where you're coming from. Some can do this without taking on people's feelings. However, for better or worse, others, like myself and many of my patients, can become angst-sucking sponges. This often overrides the sublime capacity to absorb positive emotions and all that is beautiful. If empaths are around peace and love, their bodies assimilate these and flourish. Negativity, though, often feels assaultive, exhausting. Thus, they're particularly easy marks for emotional vampires, whose fear or rage can ravage empaths. As a subconscious defense, they may gain weight as a buffer. When thin, they're more vulnerable to negativity, a missing cause of overeating explored in my book The Empath's Survival Guide. Plus, an empath's sensitivity can be overwhelming in romantic relationships; many stay single since they haven't learned to negotiate their special cohabitation needs with a partner.
When empaths absorb the impact of stressful emotions, it can trigger panic attacks, depression, food, sex and drug binges, and a plethora of physical symptoms that defy traditional medical diagnosis from fatigue to agorophobia. Since I'm an empath, I want to help all my empath-patients cultivate this capacity and be comfortable with it.
Empathy doesn't have to make you feel too much all the time. Now that I can center myself and refrain from shouldering civilization's discontents, empathy continues to make me freer, igniting my compassion, vitality, and sense of the miraculous. To determine whether you're an emotional empath, take the following quiz.
QUIZ: AM I AN EMPATH?
Ask yourself:
Have I been labeled as “too emotional” or overly sensitive? If a friend is distraught, do I start feeling it too? Are my feelings easily hurt? Am I emotionally drained by crowds, require time alone to revive? Do my nerves get jarred by noise, smells, or excessive talk? Do I prefer taking my own car places so that I can leave when I please? Do I overeat to cope with emotional stress? Am I afraid of becoming engulfed by intimate relationships?
If you answer “yes” to 1-3 of these questions, you're at least part empath. Responding “yes” to more than 3 indicates that you've found your emotional type.
Recognizing that you're an empath is the first step in taking charge of your emotions instead of constantly drowning in them. Staying on top of empathy will improve your self-care and relationships.
How An Empath Can Find Find Balance
Practice these strategies to center yourself.
Allow quiet time to emotionally decompress. Get in the habit of taking calming mini-breaks throughout the day. Breathe in some fresh air. Stretch. Take a short walk around the office. These interludes will reduce the excessive stimulation of going non-stop. Practice guerilla meditation. To counter emotional overload, act fast and meditate for a few minutes. This centers your energy so you don't take it on from others. Define and honor your empathic needs. Safeguard your sensitivities. Here's how.
If someone asks too much of you, politely tell them “no.” It's not necessary to explain why. As the saying goes, “No is a complete sentence.” If your comfort level is three hours max for socializing–even if you adore the people–take your own car or have an alternate transportation plan so you're not stranded. If crowds are overwhelming, eat a high-protein meal beforehand (this grounds you) and sit in the far corner of, say, a theatre or party, not dead center. If you feel nuked by perfume, nicely request that your friends refrain from wearing it around you. If you can't avoid it, stand near a window or take frequent breaks to catch a breath of fresh air outdoors. If you overeat to numb negative emotions, practice the guerilla meditation mentioned above, before you're lured to the refrigerator, a potential vortex of temptation. As an emergency measure, keep a cushion by the fridge so you can be poised to meditate instead of binge. Carve out private space at home. Then you won't be stricken by the feeling of too much togetherness.
Over time, I suggest adding to this list to keep yourself covered. You don't have to reinvent the wheel each time you're on emotional overload. With pragmatic strategies to cope, empaths can have quicker retorts, feel safer, and their talents can blossom.

On the rebound from a health plagued 2014, Avicii has used the new year as a springboard back atop the EDM circuit. Making their presence know with an impressive Ultra performance, the Swedish sensation proved that they have returned to full form. In their latest – and fittingly named – podcast ‘LEVELS', Avicii spoke candidly about a variety topic ranging from their long awaited return back to touring, Sebastian Ingrosso's controversial ‘New York Times' comment, and everything in between. Scroll down to see what else Tim Bergling shared on their podcast.
Please bear in mind that these quotes are verbatim from Avicii's ‘LEVELS – Episode 035‘, and may contain some grammatical mistakes.
1. On their musical inspirations
“Eric (Prydz) is my god in terms of production. He's always been the one that melodically has been a huge inspiration of mine.”
2. On what he's been doing the last couple months
“It's been really cool these last couple of months, mostly working in the studio and not having that many shows. I can hang out with my friends, it's really cool just to be able to chill and listen to music and talk about everything.”
3. Their take on Sebastian Ingrosso's controversial ‘New York Times' quote
“I just kind of have to defend Seb and this whole ‘New York Times' article thing. I've known Seb for a long time…I've known Seb before they knew me because I was their fan. I followed their whole career and what they wrote was taken out of context, and I couldn't believe what a big deal that became. I just want to defend them because it's just so unreal. So don't believe whatever you read in the press, it's all sensationalism.”
4. On their return to touring
“I'm back in the game, feels kind of weird coming back after an 8-month hiatus. I haven't been that nervous for the first show in Australia in a very long time.”
5. On their man-crush
“I was bromancing with Martin Garrix […] and I just want to say that I really admire Martin and really appreciate them as a friend for being so humble still and down to earth, I love you man.”
6. On their recent experience at Ultra
“I did Ultra again, (I) didn't get sick, I didn't end up at a hospital, which was awesome. The show was amazing as usual and up to this point it's almost like I've gotten to learn Ultra so much because you kind of keep looking forward to it the whole year, because all the buzz around the festival and everything that kind of goes around you in that week…it's one of those times a year you're really looking forward to, it's like a DJ vacation.”
7. On their fans' reactions to their upcoming album
“I just premiered my Ultra set a couple days ago now with a small taste of my upcoming album Stories, and so far it's getting such a great response…a lot better then I thought it was going to get. I thought it was going to be Ultra two years ago all over (again), but it's good to see that a lot of people are supporting it now. So I hope you guys will continue to do so when I start playing it on the show. (his LEVELS podcast)”
8. And finally, on the progression and eclectic sound of their new album, Stories
“I'm in LA now; I'm producing everyday, 8 hours a day. (I'm) trying to make this Stories album come together which is so much fun, and it's one of the most challenging things I've ever done, but it's also one of the most fun things I've done. It's very eclectic, It really really has a lot of everything in it and like I said before, I really honestly can't wait to see what people say about this just because it's really different than what I've done before, but then at the same time it isn't. Some of the tracks are slower BPM and some of them aren't even 4/4, but you can still kind of hear my influence throughout the whole track which I think has been interesting throughout this whole project with this album. Kind of whatever genre you can turn to there's a way of keeping your own sound in that genre, which I guess is making it a little bit different too, making it something else. Like a blues track, and it'd be a blues track with the influences from where I come from which is Eric Prydz, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso and Axwell. Everything becomes something else.”
WASHINGTON—Mississippi has one of the worst graduation rates in America. When Lanarcia Walker was called to the stage to receive their high school diploma, their proud brother shouted four congratulatory words. “You did it, baby,” Henry Walker said.

The superintendent of Senatobia High's school district, Jay Foster, had warned the crowd not to cheer until the end of the procession. They got Walker thrown out of the building. They aren't finished. Soon after the May 21 ceremony, Foster went to the police department and pressed “disturbing the peace” charges against Walker and at least two other non-silent relatives of Senatobia grads. In Mississippi, disturbing the peace is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and up to six months in the county jail. “The fact that I might have to bond out of jail, pay court costs, or a $500 fine for expressing my love — it's ridiculous, man,” Walker told Memphis television station WREG. “It's ridiculous.”

Ursula Miller told WREG that they were charged merely for shouting the name of their graduate niece. According to a document they showed WREG, Foster accused them of disturbing their personal peace. “Did wilfully and unlawfully disturb the public peace of Jay Foster … by use of loud boisterous noise, by yelling and clapping while inside the building after announcement had been made for all to hold their applause and celebrating until after the end of the ceremony by Superintendent Jay Foster,” the document says. Walker and Miller are due in court on June 9. They are both black. The case became international news on Wednesday, another perceived example of the petty persecution of African-Americans. Foster, who did not respond to a request for comment, sees the episode as a teachable moment of another sort. “My point is not to have somebody have to pay money, but I want them to know there are consequences for their behaviour, and I want us to have a dignified service,” they told the Jackson Clarion-Ledger.
“So many things these days, if I had to sum it up in a few words, it's all about me. But this is not,” they said. “This is about the graduates.” Senatobia is a city of about 8,000 near Memphis. It made national news in 2013 for imposing a ban on low-riding underwear-revealing trousers.

Mayor Alan Callicott refused to comment on the latest uproar, calling the charges “a school district matter” unconnected to the city government. Charles Irvin, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, said Walker and Miller were “just celebrating a loved one.” Irvin said it is impossible to know if race was a factor in the charges. But they said Foster had chosen “heavy-handedness” over common sense. “If, in fact, the overriding factor is that you want to make sure everyone's name is heard, a simple pause in the program may be in order,” they said. “Instead of handcuffs.”
Creeped Out Congress Grills FBI on Facial Recognition Tech
Ashkhen Kazaryan Blocked Unblock Follow Mar 23, 2017
When you get your driver's license, the DMV takes your photo. No big deal right? But if you happen to be from Michigan, or 17 other U.S. states, the FBI might scan that photo using facial recognition software.
If you're alarmed, many in Congress are right there with you. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee recently held a hearing on how law enforcement agencies use facial recognition technologies (FRTs).
The discussion primarily focused on the FBI's wide-reaching use of FRTs. Representatives from both parties took aim at the Bureau's lack of transparency and significant delays in issuing privacy impact assessments, as required by the E-Government Act. At a minimum, these assessments are supposed to reassure the public that law enforcement evaluates risks to privacy when implementing new technology. FBI witness Kimberly Del Greco danced around the issue, and committee Chair Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) voiced the collective distrust of the panel in the simplest of terms: “Sorry, but we don't believe you!”
According to a 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office, the FBI has access to at least 100 million photos from the 18 states that have a “memorandum of understanding” (MOU) with the Bureau — meaning they share photos with the feds, including those taken by state DMVs. The FBI's staggering access to state information is itself a red flag. Worse, these FBI searches are done without court-issued warrants or basic due process, which exposes innocent, law-abiding citizens to a fundamentally flawed system.
To be fair, law enforcement's job is to keep us safe. And new technologies can play a valuable role in that mission. But even the most well-intentioned efforts can backfire. The FBI's database, the Next Generation Identification Interstate Photo System (NGI-IPS) has a 20% margin of error and a well-established bias against racial and ethnic minorities, particularly African-Americans.
Members pressed Del Greco on what happens to those who are mistakenly identified. They didn't offer specifics, only mentioning that they are brought in for questioning and further investigation. Being investigated by the FBI is not some benign act, even if you are eventually cleared of wrongdoing — as recent presidential candidates can attest.
For Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-MA) and Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-MI), the biggest problem is the FBI's previously reported, and potential future use, of FRTs to target protesters who simply exercise their First Amendment rights. If that sounds kooky, consider history of Martin Luther King, Jr. or anti-Vietnam protesters, when FBI's tools were extremely low-tech compared to today's capabilities.
The hearing made clear that the FBI's critics are bipartisan, and several members promised to take legislative action. Congress should put clear restrictions on real-time face scanning, limiting its use to specific, targeted threats, such as terrorist attacks, or human trafficking. Further, any legislation must prohibit FBI from using FRTs to target First Amendment “activities” such as demonstrations and protests.
We don't have to choose between safety and privacy. Proper due process, transparency measures, audits for abuse, and independent testing for bias can ensure law enforcement keeps pace with emerging technology while upholding our core values and civil liberties.

If we are to believe a fresh report – and that's a big “if”, BMW has reached a decision to ditch the metal folding hardtop from the next-gen 4-Series Convertible. A new 4 is set to arrive in some 5 years' time, with concepts and prototypes due around one year earlier.
If true, we can assume it will be like that of the current 2-Series Cabriolet, but bigger and flashier.
The different tops give the two (very similar) models different characters: the soft top is obviously the classier option, but it's not as good as insulating, whereas the metal folding one eliminates outside noise and keeps temperature, but somehow just looks like a strange coupe.
The decision to go from a fabric top to a metal one for the 3-Series convertible (now 4-Series) was made in 2007, with the introduction of the E93 model.
Bimmertoday provides the information on the switch, but is unable to reach a conclusion as to why they're changing course. It could be in the quest for a classier look, more cargo space with the roof folded and lower weight.
We will have to wait a bit for this one to be confirmed or not…

Four-star defensive back Chauncey Gardner II (Cocoa, FL) has been committed to the Florida Gators since March. Considering they were previously pledged to the school and actually decommitted before reupping their verbal confirmation with new head coach Jim McElwain, Gardner certainly did not hurt themselves by proving their love for the team and its fans with a special gesture this week.
While at The Opening, a Nike-sponsored performance event in Oregon, Gardner was found wearing a brand-new haircut with the script “Gators” logo shaved into the back of their head.
Gardner is actually now one of Florida's strongest commitments. Rated as the No. 152 overall player in the 247Sports Composite, the 6-foot, 194-pounder has been flexing their recruiting chops throughout the process in hopes of bringing additional talent to the Gators.
You wouldn't know it by just looking at it, but the job search market is hot. Well, the tech side of it, at least. Indeed recently sold for just under $500M to a Japanese Investment firm. Taleo and Kenexa, applicant tracking system, were acquired for over a billion each.
ResumeRobin.com, a resume distribution service started in a Southern California garage by a small team of two out of work software engineers, is worth nearly a billion, disclosed by its latest funding round. That's right, a billion with a capital “B”. The company distributes your resume to a multitude of job portals and recruiters.
Job search remains a problematic area. The market is dominated by CareerBuilder, Monster, Indeed and Craigslist. ResumeRobin addressed the problem that every job seeker faced: it takes a lot of effort and time to submit your resume to even those four. Taleo and Kenexa both still have a very cumbersome resume submission process. With ResumeRobin's service, resumes can be submitted quickly and easily through one portal.
The online job market continues to evolve and new companies are popping up daily. It remains to be seen which will come out on top.
Feb 9, 2017; Boston, MA, USA; Boston Bruins interim head coach Bruce Cassidy looks on from the bench during the first period against the San Jose Sharks at TD Garden. Mandatory Credit: Winslow Townson-USA TODAY Sports
The Boston Bruins removed the interim tag and named Bruce Cassidy as head coach.
The Boston Bruins made the announcement Wednesday morning, three days after a disappointing first-round playoff exit. Bruce Cassidy was named interim head coach on Feb. 9, two days after the firing of long-time head coach Claude Julien. At the time, the Bruins were 26-23-6 and on track to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive year.
Cassidy's impact was felt immediately. They injected energy and a fresh approach, and the team responded. The Bruins won the first game under Cassidy, a 6-3 stomping of the San Jose Sharks. Then went on an 18-8-1 run to finish the regular season and secure a spot in the playoffs.
Beset by injuries, the Bruins couldn't get past the Ottawa Senators in the first round, losing the series 4-2.
Yet, despite the playoff loss, the Bruins played hard for Cassidy. From the first game under them to the final game of the playoffs, the Bruins displayed a fast-paced attacking game that had been non-existent under Julien.
Change Needed
The team had grown moribund under Julien. Their suffocating system and methods had squashed all the life out of the team. The mantra of defensive responsibility preached by Julien had grown stale. It often looked as if the team was just doing time and going through the motions. Julien zapped the fun out of hockey, and it showed.
That all changed overnight when Cassidy was named interim head coach. The Bruins skated hard and brought the energy every game, every shift. Defensive responsibilities were adjusted. Forwards were allowed to take chances. And defensemen were allowed to pinch down or join the attack when the situation called for it.
It must have been a breath of fresh air for the players in the Bruins locker room.
Cassidy's Credentials
Cassidy is a former player, as well. They were drafted in 1983 in the first round (18th overall) by Chicago. Their professional career spanned 15 seasons during which they accumulated 17 points in 36 NHL games. Their bad knees forced them to call it a career in 1997.
Cassidy began their coaching career that same year. Stints in the IHL and ECHL marked their early years as a coach. Then from 2002-2004, Cassidy was the head coach of the Washington Capitals. And in 2004 they rejoined their old club the Chicago Blackhawks to be an assistant coach. In 2008, Cassidy joined the Providence Bruins as an assistant coach. They spent the next eight years there until getting the call on May 24, 2016, to join the parent club as an assistant coach.
The Bruins are a different team with Cassidy at the helm. From day one of their promotion to interim head coach, the Bruins led the NHL in goals per game (3.37) and held opponents to the fewest shots allowed (741) while trailing only two teams in goals allowed per game (2.30).
The Bruins simply played better under Cassidy than they did under Julien. Julien did great work behind the Boston bench for years, winning a Stanley Cup in 2011 and taking the Chicago Blackhawks to six games in the Stanley Cup Finals in 2013. But a change was needed.
That change took place on Feb. 9, 2017. It was made official today by removing the interim tag and giving Cassidy the reigns of the Boston Bruins. Let the Cassidy era, officially, begin.

Ryanair and the French accordion player - the true story of a viral video that flew around the world
It promised. It intrigued. It delivered.
When you clicked, you were rewarded with a genuinely heart-warming scene. A confused Frenchman on a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Nice, asked to reveal the contents of a bag on theirs lap... and plucking out a "squeeze box".
"What is this? An accordion?" one of the flight attendants asked. "This is an Irish company and you have to play the accordion."
So they did. And soon a plane-load of passengers joined in.
Since then, the video has been viewed almost 20 million times on Facebook alone, and featured in publications ranging from Ireland to the UK, US and India.
"Meanwhile in Ireland... Ryanair is no United Airlines," quipped The Irish Post, referring to the now-infamous incident in which passenger David Dao was dragged down the aisle of a United aircraft, before being removed from the flight.
"It was just this little moment of magic," says Francois Colussi, the man at the centre of the video, sharing their story exclusively with Independent.ie Travel.
But was the video a genuine moment, or a pre-rehearsed PR stunt, as some on social media have suggested? What was the real story behind it?
Colussi lives in Ireland, where they run the Pure Magic kitesurfing centres in Achill Island and Dublin, as well as the city's Battle for the Bay watersports festival.
While travelling to Nice, they say they bumped into a friend - Clontarf business person Ronan Morris, of Together Digital - and the two managed to switch seats for a chat.
It was then that the plan for mischief was hatched.
Francois takes their accordion to the Wild Atlantic Way on Achill Island, where they runs 'Pure Magic' Kitesurfing.
"It was a little magic trick," Colussi says. Shortly afterwards, the pair were asking the Ryanair crew "if they had five minutes to do something unusual."
"We were worried that the flight attendants would not allow it, but they were very enthusiastic... I mentioned the United Airlines incident, and the idea we had to show how we do things differently in Ireland. They loved the idea!"
A few minutes later, the two cabin crewmembers approached Colussi and asked what was in their bag. "They were very convincing," they say.
The moment itself was improvised, they add. Asked to play a song, Colussi struck up the opening bars of 'Dirty Old Town', made famous by The Pogues, just a few minutes before the plane was due to begin its final descent.
Unlike other recent airline cabin encounters, this one ended happily with some off-key singing from Morris... clapped along by dozens of fellow passengers.
What did Ryanair think of it all?
"As Europe's most punctual airline, Ryanair customers are already used to hearing our on-time arrival music on landing," the airline told Independent.ie Travel.

"All onboard enjoyed this extra bonus track mid–flight."
"There was no intention whatsoever to gain money or to look for fame," Colussi says. "It was just this little moment of magic to make people think... and smile."
They describe it as "a parody" of negative passenger incidents.
Publicity for Pure Magic and the Battle for the Bay festival, due to take place in Dublin next weekend (battleforthebay.com), won't hurt of course.
"So, yes it was a set up but a pretty random one!"

Location-based apps are all the rage today, but according to Omri Moran, CEO of KitLocate, the most popular ones are already out of date. “You can get basic apps that work with all smartphone platforms that tell you where you are and/or broadcast your location, but location has a lot more potential. Retailers, travel app makers, bus and taxi companies, social app makers, and many more have been unable to take advantage of the full potential of location because of the way it is implemented.”
“What KitLocate brings to the table is a different way of looking at location, one that will bring about much more benefit for these service providers and businesses, and enhance the experience for users,” Moran said, in their first in-depth interview on KitLocate, which has already been feted for its technology; the company was awarded $25,000 in 2012 in MasterCard's first-ever Israel Technology Awards. More recently, KitLocate was enrolled in the local branch of the Microsoft Ventures Accelerator, one of eleven companies chosen out of hundreds for the prestigious spot.
Moran, along with their co-founders Ron Miller, Yoav Cafri and the rest of the team of six engineers, is developing a system that allows a device to monitor user movement all day, activate apps to take actions based on whether or not a person is stationary or mobile, and determine relative locations of on-the-move devices to ensure relevance – all with a savings of as much as 80% of the battery power, said Moran. “The way we do location services, you can have them running all day, all the time, and make it home with plenty of juice left in your device,” they said.

And the way to do that, they said, was to look beyond the GPS chip for location information, collecting data via wifi, accelerometers, and other sensors in the device. “In order to do location properly, you need statistics and information about a user's habits that you can analyze to keep track of what a person is doing,” Moran said. “This allows apps to anticipate needs and spring into action when necessary, and it also reduces the strain on the battery, because not all sensors have to be running at all times in order to ensure that a user gets the services they want.”
A lot of location services are contextual, said Moran, and as the context changes, the tools used to determine location – and what services should be supplied – change as well. “For example, if a person is driving on a highway and the next exit is ten miles away and we see that traffic in the area is light, we don't need to check the GPS chip every five seconds to determine location.” Polling can be less frequent; thus, said Moran, the device will use less power, and the battery will last longer.
Once the system sees that a driver has stopped, KitLocate's system will deactivate the GPS chip, and activate another sensor and/or switch an app, where appropriate, based on context. For example, a driver using Waze, one of the premier geolocation apps, enters destination information in the app and gets back a set of directions, based on traffic information, routes, etc. But say you have to go to an address you can't drive exactly to, like an apartment on an upper floor; Waze will take you to where the building is located and announce that you have reached your destination – leaving you to figure out what to do next.
“With KitLocate, the system will determine that you have stopped driving and are now moving much more slowly, and figure out that you are now walking,” said Moran. “It can then open up another app, like Google Maps, which will take over and give you walking directions to the exact spot you need.”
Data is another important element in the KitLocate toolkit. The system makes novel use of geofencing, a system that takes specific actions based on where a user is located. Using data the system collects on habits – what stores users frequent, even which sections of a store they are more interested in (i.e., the mens or ladies department), KitLocate allows businesses to proactively offer users services and experiences they could otherwise not offer. The information is collected from the apps that use the KitLocate system, and analyzed by the powerful big data apps.
“For example, there are services based on wifi or Bluetooth that allow stores in a mall to determine if a shopper is close by, and offer them or their coupons,” said Moran. “But what if the store has a partnership deal with a restaurant? If they knew that the user enjoyed the food there, they could offer them a coupon for a freebie at their partner restaurant. But you could only know something like that by keeping track of users' habits and movements, as KitLocate would have, recording the fact that this customer has been to that restaurant X times in the past few months.”
Another use case could be parsing data about what interests a user and offering them a coupon via a pop-up for a new store or service – one they had not heard about before, but which KitLocate believes will interest them, based on their profile – or activating a social app when others who use the same app and with whom the user has relationships is nearby. Mixing in data, location, and context is a potent brew that has the potential to bring new services and experiences that will benefit many people, said Moran. “It goes beyond defining a place and taking actions based on it,” said Moran. “In our system, the user becomes the place, and all potential services are available at all times.”
A real-life example of KitLocate in action, said Moran, is with Pango, the Israel-developed app that lets you use your cellphone to pay for parking fees. “Pango had a problem, in that users would activate it and forget that they did so, and figure out only hours later that they were paying for a parking space they had left hours before.” While this doesn't sound like something a business would be too worried about – caveat emptor and all that – Pango was desperately seeking a solution.
“People were very upset and Pango was afraid they were going to lose their customer base,” said Moran. “We set them up with our system and enabled them to turn the app off, and stop charging users, after they had driven away from their spot.” Thanks to KitLocate, Pango now proactively turns itself off after the KitLocate system tells the app that the driver is no longer parked, and thus no longer needs Pango.
KitLocate makes other assumptions as well, and it's those assumptions, based on data, movement, location, speed, etc. – all the elements that a device's sensors record – that allows such a dramatic battery savings, to the extent, said Moran, that a KitLocate-equipped device uses as little as 1% of its battery power per hour, even with multiple location, wifi, and bluetooth apps running.
Kitlocate, for example, will close off all of a device's sensors when it determines that a device has not been moved for a long time and the time is between 9AM and noon. In that case, it's most likely that the user has laid their or their device on a table and is at work; after all, that's what happens every day, Monday through Friday. By “knowing” in advance that the user is at work at those hours, and that the phone is unlikely to be moved, “we can turn off sensors or increase the amount of time we poll them to see if there are any changes, thus saving battery time,” said Moran.
Besides Pango, KitLocate has large customers in Israel and abroad, and the list of large customers is likely to grow in the coming weeks, Moran said.
For most end-users, the battery savings promised by KitLocate will be reason enough to want to have it installed on their device. But those savings were a happy by-product of Moran's determination to produce something of value to users. “We started out a few years with an app that would report discounts for users at nearby stores,” they said. “The app worked great, except that it killed the battery within a couple of hours.” As a result, Moran, an engineer, together with co-founders Miller and Cafri, made an in-depth study of GPS, along with the other sensor devices in most cellphones, and came up with KitLocate.
Moran knows KitLocate may sound a bit Big-Brotherish to some, but for those worried about even further losses of privacy in an already very un-private world, they have some soothing advice. “Of course we are in strict compliance with all laws regarding privacy, but the law is one thing and user perception is something else. Some things can be perfectly legal, but offensive to some people.”
For them, Moran plans to recommend that devices, platforms, or apps that use their technology include a “kill” button, very prominently displayed, so that a user can easily opt out if they want to. “But we believe that users are going to want to use this, because they are going to get a lot of value out of it, and they see that we respect their wishes and needs.”
COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) — A 19-year-old Danish woman has been indicted on suspicion of violating terrorism laws for allegedly joining the Islamic State group in war-torn Syria.
Prosecutor Bo Bjerregaard says the unnamed woman is abroad — “probably in Syria” — and an international arrest warrant could be issued. They declined to give details about such an arrest order.
The woman was indicted in absentia at a closed court hearing Wednesday in suburban Copenhagen. They allegedly traveled to Syria via Turkey in June, and is also accused of having tried to help a female family member to get there in March. Media reports said their court-appointed defense lawyer pleaded not guilty.
Denmark's security service earlier said that about a third of the at least 145 people who have been radicalized since 2012 are women.
Have you ever timed your hugs? Your kisses? How about the lengths of your inhales and exhales?
Would you be surprised if I told you they're all about as long? How about if I told you that most other animals seem to experience life using roughly the same time window we're apparently looking through?
A moment = about 3 seconds
Our 3 second window into life seems to influence not only specific behaviors or activities but rather the entire way in which we perceive our world. A recent study published in the Journal of Ethology examined the duration of hugs given and received by Olympic athletes in the recent 2008 Olympic Games. The sample was pretty comprehensive including 89 men and 96 women, athlete-athlete and athlete-coach embraces, and teammate embraces as well as competitor hugs. The researchers used frame by frame analysis to examine just how long each embrace lasted and then conducted the usual analysis to see which factors affected how long embraces and touches lasted.
The overall average per hug was 3.2 second with a standard deviation of 3.2 seconds. Further analysis revealed that the only significant differences betweeen hug lengths had to do with athletes hugging their coaches (3.8 seconds) for significantly longer than their competitors (1.8 second), which is pretty much to be expected I guess given the setting. Apparently even within our usual confines, subtle differences reflect underlying intentions.
These findings fall in line with a whole slew of research from humans and animals showing that somewhere between 2-5 seconds is the longest window of what we can perceive as an independent event - a moment. Anything longer, or separated by a longer window, is perceived by us as a seperate occurence - close in time, but distinct.
When we know something is coming, our autonomic system prepares us about 3 seconds ahead of time, which makes sense because that's about how long our vagal nervous system takes to alter our heart rate and breathing. The cool thing about this study is that it extends our knowledge about this time-window to social interactions and not simply to individual experiences. Apparently, our own moment-clock affects the way we interact with others (ever have one of those really long awkward hugs?)
What does this all mean?
When put in context, and along with our of the neurophysiological limits of our bodies (it takes about half a second to initiate a movement once we decide to do it), this insight into our selves can explain much about the way we live. Indeed, no matter how much we'd like to avoid it, there are aspects to our "machine" that affect our behavior in ways that are so subtle they're almost beyond our comprehension until we discover them and they become another piece in our self-knowledge and inner-wonder. The link to , my main area of interest, may not be clear from the outset but when you think about it, if we experience life in roughly three second intervals, perhaps our interventions should prepare people to control their behavior in manners that are consistent with that? I don't know of many techniques that take this sort of thing into account... Additionally, given my interest in , it'd be interesting to see if distractability within the context of that disorder also conforms to the three-second rule.
It's important to note that this doesn't in any way mean that we can't draw meaning out of events that take longer than three seconds. Still, it'd be interesting to see how this awareness affects your experience when you start counting... Now!

Buswell quits over expense affair
Updated
Troy Buswell has resigned as Western Australia's Treasurer just three weeks before the state budget is due to be handed down.
Their resignation comes after revelations they misused public funds during a four-month affair with Greens MP Adele Carles.
Premier Colin Barnett emerged from a meeting of the State Cabinet to announce they had accepted Mr Buswell's resignation.
"This morning I met with Troy. I pointed out to them that their situation was untenable," Mr Barnett said.
"He accepted that, they agreed with that and they tendered their resignation. That resignation is applicable immediately."
Mr Barnett said they became aware of the affair about a week ago.
"While that is a private matter, the issue of government entitlements is not. I became aware of that this last weekend," they said.
Mr Barnett says the loss of Mr Buswell is a blow to the Government but "the government will deal with it".
"Mr Buswell will continue as the Member for Vasse and has told me they will continue to support the government," Mr Barnett said, adding that as Premier they would take on the role of budget treasurer.
Mr Buswell's other portfolios - Commerce, Housing and Works - will be handled by Bill Marmion.
Mr Barnett said they had referred the matter to Public Sector Commissioner Mal Wauchope, who would review the misuse of public funds and ensure any improper expenditure was repaid.
Opposition Leader Eric Ripper says Mr Barnett should have better handled the issue when they learnt of Mr Buswell's affair last week.
"Any premier, I think, managing an issue like this would be expected to ask that obvious question - were there any implications for the public arena, for public policy, for public administration in the events which occurred?" Mr Ripper said.
The former Member for Vasse, Bernie Masters, believes it is unlikely Mr Buswell will retain the seat of Vasse beyond the next election.
Mr Masters says they believe Mr Buswell will put their hand up for pre-selection but is not likely to be successful.
"I think the Liberal Party in Vasse will find someone else to take their place, and in the meantime the best that Troy can do or should do is look after the interests of the people who put them there in the first place, namely the electors of Vasse," they said.
Buswell goes public
Yesterday Mr Buswell admitted to their affair with Ms Carles, but denied it had impacted their performance as Treasurer.
"I can confirm that Adele Carles and I had an affair for almost four months, which began in late December," they said.
"This affair recently ended, at which time I advised my family and the Premier of my actions.
"My family and I have been working through this matter privately since then. I did not want this matter to become public because of the impact this publicity would have on my wife and my children."
Ms Carles made the affair public at the weekend with a lengthy statement expressing regret at the pain the relationship had caused both families.
The statement followed weeks of rumour and speculation of an affair between the pair, who are both married with children.
In an emotional press conference, Mr Buswell apologised to the Premier and their wife, confirming that they misused public funds on four occasions during the secret liaison.
"I can confirm that my ministerial car dropped me off to meet Adele Carles on three occasions. I will repay the government garage for the cost of those trips," they said.
"In mid-February I travelled to Albany in the afternoon, ahead of a series of meetings the following day. I was joined by Adele Carles that evening. I will repay the cost of the accommodation."
They also admitted to extending a government trip home from Canberra to spend two days in Sydney with Ms Carles, using their own credit card.
Mr Buswell says the relationship with Ms Carles is over and they are seeking professional help.
This is not the first time they have made national headlines.
They were twice forced to repay incorrect travel claims last year and two years ago they admitted to sniffing the chair of a female staff member and snapping the bra of a Labor staffer.

The War on Drugs are having the biggest year of their career so far with the release of this spring's Lost in the Dream. The band has also been subject to the curious venom of Mark Kozelek—also having a huge year with their Sun Kil Moon LP, Benji—but they've been quiet about it so far. Now, the War on Drugs' Adam Granofsky has finally shared some thoughts on the whole debacle in an interview with Songs for Whoever.
For those not keeping up, here is the SparkNotes version: Kozelek was pissed that a War on Drugs festival performance bled into their simultaneous set at a different stage, and called their music "beer commercial lead-guitar shit." It culminated in them writing a song called "War on Drugs: Suck My Cock". (Read Perfect Pussy singer Meredith Graves' essay about why this song is problematic here.)
In the Songs for Whoever interview, Granofsky first jokes that he's "never heard of" Kozelek. They then explains that they tried to contact Kozelek via email, and almost agreed to perform with him, until Kozelek made a snide comment conflating War on Drugs with Starbucks-rock:
I mean, to be fair to that idiot, what they said in that song… I didn't really have a problem with any of it until I heard the song. First of all, they never met us, and yet said all these things. He's such a douche. I asked somebody if I could get their e-mail, because I wasn't trying to start this stupid Twitter thing, I was just bummed. I went to a mutual friend who explained that they wouldn't give out their e-mail address. So I just got an e-mail through this friend that said "Mark wants to come to the Fillmore, they will write a song called 'War On Drugs Suck My Cock', you back them up on it and they get to play 'Beer Commercial Guitar', then you back them up on one of their songs, 'Dogs', from their new album. And then they plays 'Beer Commercial Guitar' on one of your songs."
We were on tour and I thought "this is actually a pretty cool idea, I don't have anything against this guy, this is cool." So I was really excited and was gonna write them back in a couple of days, 'cause I was busy at the time. Then two days later I get an e-mail back from him, saying "the offer has expired, maybe when I get home from tour I'll go to Starbucks and buy your record." I was like "you're such a fucking prick, dude." They were such an asshole, I didn't even say anything. Then they go to the internet and they "challenges" us to this thing, but I was like "you fucking prick, you already said 'No'!" He's such a fucking child. And then the song is just idiotic, he's just a fucking idiot. I don't have time for idiots. I'm just pissed that they tried to make it come out like they were challenging us. I had already essentially agreed to it, and then the Starbucks comment…what the fuck, dude. Get over your fucking self.

(ANTIMEDIA) New York prisons are increasingly notorious for their corruption, brutality, and incompetence. Last year, two convicted murderers escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York. In 2014, a homeless veteran “baked to death” after being left in an overheated cell at Rikers Island.
The state's correctional department has been marred not only by incompetence, but sadistic “beat up squads” of officers who brutalize inmates and others who commit sexual assault and rape. According to a new report by the New York Times and the non-profit Marshall Project, the internal investigation unit of the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision has expressed its commitment to curtailing these ongoing abuses — but it faces one major obstacle: the New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association, which has dominated New York politicians and policy for years.
Though the national conversation on mass incarceration and mistreatment in prisons has rightly focused on corrupt ties between lawmakers and the private prison lobby, the correctional officers' and police union in New York wields an impressive amount of power. The Times reported:
“The union is a formidable political force, protected in the Legislature, primarily by upstate lawmakers in districts where prisons are the biggest employers. The chairperson of the corrections committee in the State Senate, Patrick M. Gallivan, a Republican who represents an area outside Buffalo and Rochester, has five prisons in their district alone.”
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is also complicit in the increasingly apparent racket. Though they have overseen the Department of Corrections' new attempt to reign in the union, their staff is closely connected to it.
“His chief of staff, Melissa DeRosa, worked in public relations for the union for several months in 2009 and is the daughter of Giorgio DeRosa, a major Albany lobbyist whose firm received $691,000 from the union between 2010 and 2015, according to state filings,” the Times noted.
The Cuomo administration also has played down the “culpability” of violent officers.
Relationships like these have allowed the union to amass substantial control of what goes on inside correctional facilities. Thanks to the union's ongoing contract negotiations with a “long line of governors,” including Cuomo, the union retains power over personnel decisions, overriding prison superintendents and even the commissioner of the corrections department.
“Under the current contract, union seniority rules dictate that superintendents have practically no power to transfer problem officers,” the Times reported. An arbitrator — not the commissioner — decides who gets fired. Officers enjoy a 24-hour grace period before being questioned about reported incidents, and they are also not required to answer questions from outside law enforcement agencies. Further, because of privacy protections enacted thanks to lobbying from police and corrections officers unions, disciplinary actions taken against officers are kept secret.
“The result is that a culture of brutality has been allowed to thrive in the prisons, where a few rogue guards, often known on the cellblocks as beat-up squads, administer vigilante justice, while fellow officers look the other way,” the Times observed.
The investigative unit currently has a caseload of “suspected wrongdoing by officers” totaling over 1,000 incidents. The Times noted several:
Officer Peter A. Mastrantonio, an officer at Southport Correctional Facility, has been sued 17 times over allegations of brutality; the lawsuits have cost the state $673,000 in settlements, alone
A partially deaf and blind 81-year-old-man, James Willsey, was knocked unconscious while in handcuffs at Sullivan Correctional Facility
Frank Povoski, an inmate at Great Meadow, was beaten after the Times quoted in them a story about an inmate who died at the hands of officers.
Asked whether brutality was a problem, however, union president Michael B. Powers flatly said, “What are you talking about?”
Due to years of ongoing abuses like these, Cuomo authorized the Department of Corrections' internal investigations to add 34 new investigators, which expanded the team from 116 members to 150. The governor's approval represents, arguably, a response to their own policies favoring the prison union, which have allowed misconduct to run rampant.
Nevertheless, Stephen Maher, a former assistant state attorney general, was hired to fix the unit in order to deal with the state prison system's myriad shortcomings.
The new leadership appears to be taking its duties seriously. Daniel F. Martuscello III, the department's deputy commissioner, has said, “We will do anything necessary. I'm not here to make the union happy.”
Maher fired 10 percent of investigators deemed unqualified and the unit has attempted to seize power from the union — but not without pushback. In one instance, the Department of Corrections moved to fire an officer at Sing Sing prison, Lavar Thomas, who admitted they “repeatedly punched an inmate” for making “a gurgling, hocking sound as if they were going to spit.”
Though incident was caught on video, the state arbitrator decided in favor of Thomas, who had a history of “erratic” behavior. In retaliation, corrections investigators stripped certification from another officer who testified on behalf of Thomas and referred the case to the Westchester County District Attorney's office, which filed criminal charges against the officer. However, the Times noted, “under the [union labor] contract, an arbitrator's decision is ‘final and binding' and a misdemeanor conviction is not grounds for automatic termination,” which highlights the power of union's purchased influence on policy.
Unsurprisingly, investigators hoping to combat the unions imbalanced control have run into other problems beyond rigid labor contracts.
“Guards can be slow to produce inmate witnesses from the cellblocks and will routinely confer, in efforts to get their stories straight, current and former department officials said,” and investigators have been blocked from entering prisons. “I once knew of an investigator who got their jaw broken by a C.O. from Clinton,” said Patrick Dunleavy, a former deputy commissioner of the unit.
But the union's resistance is not limited to thwarting the investigations unit, nor is it a recent development. A 26-year veteran of the corrections department, Barbara Kowaleski, spoke out in 2002 after witnessing another officer, Michael Rorick, abuse an inmate at Hale Creek Correctional Facility. They claimed they were repeatedly harassed and eventually fired, and a lawsuit ultimately recognized their status as a whistleblower. They were awarded $200,000.
While Kowaleski's case was eventually resolved (as best the system could manage), one threat they received highlights the power dynamic the investigations seek to interrupt. In their lawsuit, Kowaleski alleged two union officials, Rorick and Donald Rowe led a campaign against them
“At one point,” the Times reported, “when they were driving home from work, Mr. Rowe, who was then the union shop flight attendant, drove up and forced their pickup truck off the road.
“Mr. Rowe was later elected president of the statewide union.”
The Times reports that according to state records, both men still work at the prison. The union's current president, Michael B. Powers, has dismissed recent criticisms of officer misconduct and brutality:
“We're the best at what we do…best in the nation.”

Yahoo's Flurry breaks down annual user trends in mobile apps
Social apps like WhatsApp and Kik have made a big deal out of their efforts to partner with brands on emoji keyboards. With new data on 2015 app usage trends from Flurry, that strategy suddenly makes a lot more sense — emoji keyboards and other personalization apps saw 332% growth in usage through 2015.
Yahoo-owned Flurry, one of the world's largest mobile ad networks with around 700,000 apps represented, reviewed data from 3.2 trillion user sessions over the course of the year, and broke down which categories saw the most growth. Personalization apps (a category that includes emoji icon sets along with Android homescreen apps, photo filters and widgets) saw by far the most growth, followed by news and magazines and productivity apps.
After a bit of digging, Flurry concluded that most of the growth in personalization really was thanks to emoji keyboards. By now, emoji use is close to ubiquitous with 64% of chat users of all ages saying they use one at least a couple of times a week. Emoji keyboard apps — which can be free or paid for — come with a library of additional icons for users to personalize their messages with, from beloved cartoon characters to a pack of Burger King chicken fries or Kim Kardashian's butt.
2015 saw an explosion in the number of different emoji add-ons available, both from developers recognizing the demand for a more personal chat experience, and from brands that wanted to get in on the action. Apple, for example, added 150 new icons in iOS 9.1, while Facebook Messenger now boasts dozens of third-party GIF and sticker libraries.
Brands have done everything they can to reinforce the trend. Companies like Swyft Media have built an entire business model around branded emojis, claiming it's developed keyboards for more than 300 brands and media properties. Brands like Mentos, Ikea, Coca-Cola and Burger King have all created their own custom keyboards. Kim Kardashian made their inevitable entry into the space over the Christmas break, and within days had become one of the top 10 grossing entertainment apps on the Apple App Store.
News and magazine apps in rude health
Flurry's reporting also had good news for legacy media, which saw considerable growth in mobile app sessions, particularly on large-format smartphones and tablets. Session counts were up 721% in the “phablet” category, likely thanks to a wealth of tablet-specialized news experiences.
The success of news apps contributed to a 334% increase in overall app usage coming from phablets, though the bigger trend is the growth in phablet ownership. Flurry says 27% of all new devices activated at Christmas were phablets, and it projects that by Q1 2017 more than half of all device activations will be phablets.
In total, Flurry says that mobile app use worldwide was up 58% over 2014, and that time spent with mobile apps was up 117%. An earlier report from Flurry focused on the Canadian market found that usage in Canada was up a more modest 26% year over year, with sports and fitness apps being the fastest growing category among Canadians (though that report didn't break out “personalization” as a category separate to social and messaging).
Flurry's network reaches 2 billion unique devices, 37 million of which are in Canada.
Militants have killed two Lebanese soldiers in an attack on a checkpoint in Wadi Hmayyed in northeast Lebanon Saturday, according to a security source, as the Lebanese Army freed two troops kidnapped earlier in the area.
An unnamed Lebanese security official told Reuters late on Saturday that eleven militants killed in fighting with Lebanese Army near Syrian border.
The source said that two Army soldiers were killed when the militants attacked the checkpoint on the outskirts of the Bekaa Valley town of Arsal, while another soldier was wounded in Arsal.
Tensions have risen dramatically in the Bekaa Valley after an Army arrest of a Syrian militant sparked a standoff Saturday afternoon in Arsal, with armed men laying siege to government facilities in the border town, demanding the release of the captive.
The Lebanese Army has launched a security plan in the border region, setting up centers and checkpoints to curb the infiltration of armed groups into Lebanon.

No Stanley Cup playoffs in Canada. That's the scene this spring in the country that considers itself the leader in all things hockey.
There will be great representation of the Canadian-based NHL teams at the world championship coming up in Russia, and there's also the World Cup coming this fall.
But for NHL fans, May and June are supposed to be all about the pursuit of the Stanley Cup. Those hopes are dead for yet another season, making it 23 years and counting since the Stanley Cup was captured by a team based in Canada. Woe Canada, indeed.
It's no stretch to say that streak won't come to an end next season. There are no championship contenders in Canada right now, nor will there be in the near future. Rebuild is the most popular catchphrase in a lot of Canadian front offices right now.
Since the chances of all seven Canadian teams missing the playoffs in the same year are, according to Elias Sports Bureau, one in 600, let's assume it won't happen again next year. The question is: Which teams are most likely to be on the road to respectability?
1. Montreal Canadiens: Getting a healthy Carey Price back for the beginning of next season gives the Habs a chance to be back in the playoffs as early as next spring. This is factor No. 1.
Montreal has a handful of expiring contracts, but no one of note is in the position to walk. Maybe they fire Michel Therrien and get the juice of adding a new coach. This roster is better than its 2015-16 results. Still, expect general manager Marc Bergevin to try and upgrade a few positions.
Bottom line, if Price is healthy, the Habs make a run at the playoffs and could even win a round as currently constructed.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2016-17
Carbonneau: Habs are a few pieces away Former Montreal Canadiens' forward, head coach and three time Stanley Cup champion Guy Carbonneau joins Mike Tyler of TSN 1150 to talk playoffs and Pepsi/Subway "Hoist The Cup" promotion.
2. Calgary Flames: GM Brad Treliving has two priorities this off-season: Find a No. 1 goalie and extend Johnny Gaudreau and Sean Monahan. Issues in the crease held the Flames back this season. They sit 30th in the NHL is team save percentage and 11th in goals for. The Flames have north of $12 million coming off the books in goalie salary. The UFA goalie market isn't deep, with Cam Ward and James Reimer being the most interesting names. Could Treliving pry prospect Matt Murray out of Pittsburgh prior to an expansion draft?
The Flames have strong pieces on the blueline and two of the NHL's best young players in Gaudreau and Monahan. They're not far off.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2016-17
3. Winnipeg Jets: Certainly Canada's most underperforming team this season and maybe the biggest disappointment in the entire league. From 99 points in the Central Division and a playoff berth to membership in the lottery pick race in a single season. The question for the Jets: Was this an anomaly? Lack of discipline sunk this team. Winnipeg's power-play goal differential was second worst in the NHL at -22. It killed them.
H&L's 5:15 Referendum: Petan, Morrissey & Kosmachuk. Hustler and Lawless discuss whether Nic Petan, Josh Morrissey and Scott Kosmachuk are a part of the future for the Winnipeg Jets.
The Jets need to be better in goal, but prospect Connor Hellebuyck showed he's on the verge with a .918 save percentage in their 26 games this season. Centre Mark Scheifele broke through (27 goals with three games left on the schedule) and a number of prospects got their feet wet. The Jets will have competition for roster spots next year and should be much better. The question for them is can they close the gap on the rest of the Central? It's still the toughest division in hockey.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2017-18
4. Ottawa Senators: It looks like head coach Dave Cameron is out but will that really fix what ails the Senators? Nope. They'll tread water next season unless things go perfectly in the health department. They're trying to grow organically and prospects Colin White and Thomas Chabot should be the next to come on-stream. Owner Eugene Melnyk won't like this, but expect the Senators to be on the outside of the playoff picture next year as well.
Erik Karlsson is a great start, but the blueline falls off dramatically when he's on the bench. Mark Stone is the best forward but they need help. The Sens are too thin to sustain through the expected adversity of an NHL season. They need time.
Cameron: Challenge all year has been puck management Steve and Todd talk to the head coach of the Ottawa Senators Dave Cameron about the goal for the final 3 games, the play of the young guys and an update on Mark Stone.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2018-19
5. Edmonton Oilers: GM Peter Chiarelli has the largest war chest of assets to work with and could make some major improvements to their club via trades. With Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl and Darnell Nurse the only untouchables in Edmonton, the GM has pieces such as Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Jordan Eberle and Nail Yakupov to put in play.
The Oilers need to get better in goal and on the blueline, but they have the assets to make it happen. Chiarelli will be among the most watched GMs in the NHL this summer. Still, it's a lot to ask the Oilers to go from the very bottom of the NHL to a playoff berth in one off-season. Look for the Oilers to take a few steps, just not enough.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2018-19
6. Vancouver Canucks: Where to start? Actually, that's a question it seems the Canucks are still asking themselves. Are they in teardown mode? Or are they trying to retool?
Abbott: Virtanen needs to move beyond the "I'm learning" mindset Jon Abbott says Jake Virtanen says he's learned from a two-game suspension for a late hit, but Abbs says Virtanen now needs to start moving beyond the "I'm learning" stage and start putting those learning moments to game situations. Abbs also discusses the move of Andrey Pedan to a swing player role and suggests it's going to be a lot more work than it might seem.
They should be looking to bottom out.
Take the Sedins out of the picture and this roster is bleak. Ryan Miller appears done and the jury is still out on Jacob Markstrom. The blueline has Alex Edler, Chris Tanev and then a lot of hope. Bo Horvat and Brandon Sutter are strong in the middle, but neither screams No. 1 centre. The Canucks need to go farther down before they can go up.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2018-19
7. Toronto Maple Leafs: The Leafs have put a lot of work into tearing down their roster and, give them credit, have been serious about the job. Now comes the hard part: the actual rebuilding. The prospect pool is fairly shallow. They need help everywhere. The Leafs best prospects, Mitch Marner, William Nylander and Kasperi Kapanen are very raw and can't be expected to transform a team.
Masters: Kadri could be a good #2 centre on contender TSN Leafs reporter Mark Masters joins Game Day with Matt Cauz and Gareth Wheeler to discuss the wild couple of weeks Nazem Kadri has had to close out the 2015-2016 season.
Toronto's big hope for a step forward is with the draft lottery and the free-agent signing of Steven Stamkos. If they manage to win the lottery and draft Auston Matthews then follow it up with Stamkos, then they could move up this list.
Estimated time of playoffs: 2018-19
At last year's EVE Online Fanfest, developer CCP Games announced Project Legion, a complete reimagining of failed console MMOFPS DUST 514 for the PC. DUST launched on PS3 back in 2013 to a lacklustre reception, failing to meet the company's goals of drawing millions of console gamers into the universe of EVE Online. A potential relaunch on PC with revamped gameplay had some EVE players excited at last year's fanfest, but this year CCP has been oddly silent on the title.
Yesterday's keynote speech at EVE Fanfest 2015 mentioned Legion only in passing by CEO Hilmar, who said there was “nothing to report on it” but that devs are still “exploring in that area.” Questions about Legion have been met with fairly universal silence throughout the event, and the message now is that development efforts are continuing on DUST 514. Jeremy Peel over at PC Games N spoke with CCP's Shanghai office managing director Jean-Charles Gaudechon today and managed to tease a little more information out of them on the current state of Legion and DUST 514.
Gaudechon was wary of creating expectations by giving out a lot of information on the current state of Legion, but was able to confirm that it is still under development as part of work on DUST. Rather than building a new PC game from scratch, the studio is now trying to fix all of the problems with DUST before confirming a port to the PC. This is a huge departure from last year's plan of rebuilding the gameplay from the ground up, but it may make more sense.
DUST 514‘s playerbase is small, but the player activity is now fairly stable, with about 2,400 players online at any one time. Rather than abandoning those players as was feared last year, developers seem to be refocused on making DUST 514 the best it can possibly be and then see whether it will translate to PC. While PC is definitely still a target, Gaudechon wasn't able to confirm that a PC release would definitely happen. With this year's Fanfest theme being real features and content that can be delivered inside of a year, the silence on Legion is understandable if a little disappointing to those who were looking forward to an EVE FPS on PC.

Story highlights One theory among Democrats: Russia was behind spikes in anti-Clinton fake news
Trump campaign staff said Facebook testimony could clear their names
Congressional investigators likely to face a tough battle trying to get answers
(CNN) Top Democrats on the House and Senate Russia investigations and a top digital staffer from the campaign of President Donald Trump split sharply on whether the campaign colluded with Russia, but many agree that Facebook holds the answers investigators are looking for and they want the social media giant to give up the goods.
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, met with Facebook officials in California more than a month ago as part of their committee's investigation into potential collusion or election interference, and he's convinced the company can explain whether anyone from the Trump campaign helped Russians boost fake news articles targeting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Warner is testing the theory popular among Democratic operatives that Russia was behind spikes in fake news that were anti-Clinton and that Russia had help targeting those articles from US political operatives.
"If the Russians know, how are the Russians smart enough to target in areas where the Democrats weren't knowledgeable enough? I don't feel like I have run that to ground yet," Warner told CNN.
"There are two questions. One is: Was there coordination or collusion between the campaigns and these technology tools, which overwhelmed the search engine tools so that certain stories popped up at the top of your newsfeed. The second is, on a broader basis going forward: How do we prevent this from happening again?" Warner said.
Likewise, House investigators plan to interview former Trump campaign digital director Brad Parscale as part of their probe. A Democratic committee source said they want to know whether Parscale or anyone else from the campaign helped guide Russian targeting of fake news stories.

One of the most popular posts here on the blog last spring was about the Wilkinsburg Vacant Home Tour. Blogger Ray Bowman wrote a recap of their visit to the tour here.
I was able to stop by and check out a few of the houses featured on the tour, I was on the fence about the idea of bringing a bunch of people to see vacant homes in Wilkinsburg. I was impressed with many of the efforts behind this event and the amount of history that was shared on each of the properties.
The planning meeting for the 2016 Wilkinsburg Vacant Home Tour is on Thursday, March 3rd from 6-8pm at the PHLF Resource Center located at 744 Rebecca Avenue in Wilkinsburg.
Historic Preservation & Building Reuse in Pittsburgh
Interested in historic preservation in Pittsburgh? Here are some other links worth a look…
In late March, news broke that Elon Musk had embarked on a new project dedicated to linking human brains to computers. According to the Wall Street Journal, Musk had founded a company called Neuralink, which was developing a "neural lace" technology that would "allow people to communicate directly with machines without going through a physical interface." They promised on Twitter that within a week or so a long piece explaining the project in detail would be published on the popular blog, WaitButWhy.
At that point I wrote a blog post of my own, wondering how this new endeavor fit with Musk's previously expressed concerns about the existential threat artificial intelligence supposedly poses to the human species. Musk is among the few members of the techno-science elite—Bill Gates and Stephen Hawking are others—who have publicly warned that AI is developing so quickly that machines could soon become smart enough to take control of their own destinies, and ours. My blog post asked whether Neuralink represented a defense against the AI threat or a surrender to it. Along with many others, I looked forward to WaitButWhy's piece for answers.
The post, titled " Neuralink and the Brain's Magical Future ," took a bit longer than a week to appear, and when it did its length was daunting: more than 36,000 words, or 200 pages, the size of a small book. Nonetheless dozens of readers reacted with ecstatic pleasure. Comments on the WaitButWhy web site labeled it "a masterpiece" "mind-bending," "insightful," "ingenious" and "awesome."
My reaction was considerably less positive. The tone of the piece was occasionally charming and the stick figure drawings were fun, but overall it seemed bloated, self-indulgent, and too cute by half. Its musings about the impacts and promise of technology in particular struck me as ill-informed, glib, and almost entirely lacking in critical judgment.
The author of the piece is a guy named Tim Urban, whose WaitButWhy posts on a variety of subjects have earned them a large and passionate following. He's celebrated for disproving the notion that the Internet has killed long-form writing. One of their fans is Elon Musk, who previously had reached out to Urban, inviting them to write about Musk's other ventures. Lengthy essays on Tesla and SpaceX followed. This latest piece was written with Musk's blessing and the cooperation of Neuralink's team of researchers.
Without further ado, then, here are three reasons I find "Neuralink and the Brain's Magical Future" confirmation of a line from Proverbs: "In the multitude of words, there wanteth not sin."
1. Get to the fucking point already.
The explanation Musk had said would appear in a week or so arrived nearly eight weeks later. That wouldn't be a problem if it had been worth the wait, but it turned out Urban could have saved themselves a lot of time and trouble if he'd cut the piece by two thirds. After introductory promises that what we'll be talking about here is nothing less than the destiny of humankind, there are long, long lectures on the evolution of the brain, the physiology of the brain, the development of language, and the evolution of communication technologies, consuming thousands of words and teaching us:
a) little that any reasonably educated person didn't already know, or couldn't easily learn from Wikipedia, and a) little that any reasonably educated person didn't already know, or couldn't easily learn from Wikipedia, and
b) nothing at all about Neuralink. b) nothing at all about Neuralink.
Urban is 32,000 words in before they get round to describing what Neuralink is up to and why Musk thinks it could counter the existential threat from AI. This might explain why, outside of special-interest web sites, there's been a striking lack of response to "Neuralink and the Brain's Magical Future." Commenters in more mainstream outlets, I suspect, simply didn't have the time or the patience required to digest it.
I've taken the time, which, due to a series of interruptions in my personal life (driving across the country and looking for a job, to name two), turned out to be much longer than anticipated. Let me begin, then, by answering the question I started with: Does Neuralink represent Musk's defense against the AI threat or their surrender to it?
The answer is, Both.
Urban writes that they interviewed Musk in 2015 and asked if they would ever join the effort to build super-intelligent AI. “My honest opinion is that we shouldn't build it," Musk said then. Two years later, their views had changed. " I was trying to really sound the alarm on the AI front for quite a while," they say, "but it was clearly having no impact [laughs] so I was like, 'Oh fine, okay, then we'll have to try to help develop it in a way that's good.'”
Developing AI "in a way that's good," it turns out, means finding a way to merge with it, literally. Human beings must incorporate AI into our brains, Musk believes, so that we can maintain a "tight symbiosis" (his words) with AI as it develops. If we don't, we run the risk that AI will evolve in ways antithetical to our interests and eventually decide to take charge, lest we interfere with its plans. AI must not come to see us as "other," Musk says. If it does, the best we can hope for is that it will treat us nicely, as we treat our pets.
So, Musk hasn't changed their mind about AI's existential threat, but they have decided that it can't be stopped, and that if we can't beat 'em, we'd better join 'em. Their strategy is reminiscent of the old gangster adage, keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Like their plan to colonize Mars, it reflects a dark vision of a dystopian future. They caution as well that we ought not waste time acting to prevent that future—the emergence of super-intelligent AI will be upon us before we know it.
Information regarding how Neuralink hopes to achieve this "tight symbiosis" with AI emerges in the later sections of Urban's piece. Basically the idea is to develop a brain implant—Urban calls it a "wizard hat"—that would serve as a wireless interface with a "cloud-based customized AI system." Musk and Urban emphasize that such an implant represents only the next logical step along a path we've long been traveling. We're already cyborgs, they say, united with our machines. The difference here is that our machines will be inside us.
This "whole-brain interface," Urban writes, w ould AI wouldn't be 'other'—it would be you…" allow us "to communicate wirelessly with the cloud, with computers, and with the brains of anyone with a similar interface in their head." The flow of information between your brain and the outside world, they add, will be so effortless, "it would feel similar to the thinking that goes on in your head today." As Musk puts it, "If we achieve tight symbiosis,
All of this left me with the same basic misgiving I had when I heard Musk's initial Neuralink announcement: Shouldn't we be trying to become less cyborgian, rather than more?
2. Enthusiasm Unbound
Tim Urban has a bachelor's degree in political science from Harvard, but they apparently educate themselves on the topics they choose to write about. They possess a passion for study and an active curiosity, both excellent qualifications for a writer. Unfortunately, they don't seem especially adept at questioning their own assumptions, or especially inclined to seek out those who would question them.
multiple tipping points that will lead to unimaginable change." In the course of their essay Urban reveals themselves to be an extreme technology enthusiast. He's convinced that the development of technology is the driving force behind the emergence of what they call "the Human Colossus," which they depict in one of their drawings as a stick figure standing on top of the Earth. They believe the development of "newer and better" technology is the species' "core motivation." The dramatic pace and scope of technological advance today causes them to conclude that we've arrived at the hinge of history. "The Human Colossus has reached an entirely new level of power," they write, "—the kind of power that can overthrow 3.8-billion-year eras—positioning us on the verge oftipping points that will lead to unimaginable change."
Two points this argument overlooks:
1) Enthusiasts have been declaring at least since the start of the Industrial Revolution that technology is on the verge of leading us to unimaginable change. In some ways it has, but it's also true that certain fundamental characteristics of human life—birth, death, disease, family, community, inequality, conflict, work—remain. The dream is that technology will create a utopia in which we'll be freed from all needs and cares. Urban doesn't promise this explicitly, but that's the implication. He's the latest enthusiast to believe that they were born at the dawn of a new millennium. It's a way of thinking you're special. Never mind that after several centuries of identical promises, we're still waiting for utopia to arrive.
does end up harming a lot of people," they write. "But it also always seems to help a lot more people than it harms. Advancing technology almost always proves to be a net positive." People who think that advancing technology might not be a net positive simply haven't thought about it hard enough, they say. "New technology always comes along with real dangers and it alwaysend up harming a lot of people," they write. "But it also always seems to help a lotpeople than it harms. Advancing technology almost always proves to be a net positive." People who think that advancing technology might not be a net positive simply haven't thought about it hard enough, they say. 2) Urban also shares with other enthusiasts the conviction that technological advance means progress. They make an effort to be balanced on this score.
You have to wonder why Urban would get into this debate in the first place, and since they do get into it, why they didn't think harder about it himself. The purpose of the project he's writing about, after all, is to prevent technology from enslaving humankind. They acknowledge a number of existing problems associated with technological advance—the threat of nuclear war, automobile and airplane fatalities, the spread of fake news, cyberattacks, the enhanced ability of terrorist groups to recruit new members, and the ability of sexual predators to find new victims—but shrugs them off as trivial compared to technology's gifts. Any number of other technology-related problems might have been mentioned, some of which—global warming and the election of Donald Trump come to mind—pose threats to the future of the planet at least as plausible as a takeover by artificial intelligence.
Urban doesn't ignore the possibility that the Neuralink project, should it succeed, could present some undesirable side effects of its own. Their essay includes a section titled "The scary thing about wizard hats." That they say "thing" when they mean "things" is a sign they want to get this out of the way quickly, and they do. They list four potential scary things:
trolls might mess with the computer in your brain,
the computer in your brain might crash,
the computer in your brain might be hacked by people who want to steal your thoughts, and
the computer in your brain might be hacked by people who want to put thoughts into it.
Why the Wizard Era will be a good thing anyway even though there are a lot of dicks." Urban devotes all of 321 words to these problems before moving on to the next section, which is titled "

Excision might already be one of the biggest bass acts in EDM but that doesn't mean they can't get even bigger. There have been rumors floating around that the dubstep legend would be starting their own festival, and while details still remain scarce, it looks like this might be happening fairly soon!
Not just me, dozens of your favorite bass dj's! 😉 https://t.co/irvC8OoXAa — Excision (@Excision) May 4, 2017
Other than that, there's not much else we can tell you. Excision has revealed that it won't be the first weekend of September, as he'll be playing at Electric Zoo in New York, which leaves us three more weekends to work with.
Judging by this screenshot, it looks like plans for this festival have been in motion for some time – which makes sense if they want to pull this off by September. In any case, keep your eyes and ears out for more details bass heads. You'll probably not want to miss this one!

With the fervor in 2016 presidential election reaching new heights, the FixGov team decided to put together a video series on election basics. In this video I talk about some of the myths around the existence of superdelegates to the Democratic convention. For most of American history political parties nominated presidents in conventions composed almost exclusively of superdelegates—primaries were either non-existent or “beauty contests” only—meaning that they didn't matter in awarding delegates to presidential candidates. I also de-bunk some of the other myths about superdelegates such as the fact that the superdelegates have never, since 1984 when they were first in use, reversed the decision of the majority of voters in the primaries and caucuses. Watch the video for more:

Otherwise known as Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail, this was the first feature-length film done by the Monty Python troupe following the conclusion of Monty Python's Flying Circus (not counting And Now for Something Completely Different, which is more a collection of sketches). Made on a shoestring budget, directed by two men who'd never helmed a film before, and rife with issues during production, it nonetheless became a cult classic and favourite film for British comedy fans. 2015 is the 40th Anniversary of the film's release and in honour of that mark; here are ten interesting facts about this hilarious trip the Middle Ages.
Rock n' Roll Funding
Done on an incredibly small budget, the Pythons found funding from an unlikely sources—rock bands. Groups like Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull, and Pink Floyd helped get the money up for the production, with a portion of the funds coming from the Floyd's album “The Dark Side of the Moon.” This is a trend that would continue later with The Life of Brian, when a large portion of the funding came from former Beatle George Harrison. When Harrison was asked why they funded the film, they responded “Because I wanted to see it.”
“It's Only a Model”
While the exteriors of several castles (and a couple of models) are shown in the film, the Pythons only got permission to use one for filming interior scenes. The original plan was to use several castles owned by the National Trust of Scotland, but after the authorities read the script, they denied the group the right to film in any of the Trust's castles, which left the Pythons with only privately owned castles as an option. Fortunately, the Earl of Moray, the owner of Doune Castle, had also given their permission. As a result, all interior castle scenes are filmed at Doune and redecorated to look like different sets. Today, the castle is open to the public and the audio tour is done by Terry Jones.
First Attempt
The film also represents the directorial debuts of both Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, who decided that anyone named Terry got to direct the Pythons' first film. Attempting to co-direct at the same time led to conflicts, so the Terrys split up the responsibilities with Jones handling the actors while Gilliam worked on the cinematography. They'd go on to direct the remaining Python films together and Jones would additionally direct Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, while Gilliam's lengthy directorial career would include such artistic classics as The Fisher King, Brazil, Time Bandits, Twelve Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus, and more.
Casting Gags
There are several great moments of casting in the film. Beyond the Pythons doing their usual bit of playing multiple roles, several other notable individuals appear in the film. John Cleese's then-wife, Connie Booth, appears as the witch for Sir Bedevere's scene. Michael Palin's own son William appears in the film (as a photograph) for “Sir Not Appearing in this Picture”. Python songwriter Neil Innes appears three separate times as one of the self-flagellating monks, a squire who gets the Trojan Rabbit dropped on him, and Sir Robin's lead minstrel. Lastly, though Cleese plays most of the Black Knight's part, a local blacksmith named Richard Burton (really) plays the role after the Black Knight gets their leg chopped off, as Burton was missing a leg.
Talking to Himself
In addition to playing Arthur, Graham Chapman also provided the voice of the Gilliam-animated God. God's appearance was based upon famous cricketer W.G. Grace. Chapman was also in the midst of alcohol withdrawal while filming. As such, no alcohol was kept on set and the Bridge of Death scene had to be completed with a body double because Chapman's delirium tremens caused them to freeze up during the filming of it.
No Animals Were Harmed (Per Se)
The vicious Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog had parts of its fur dyed red to represent the blood of the knights that it spilt with its large, pointy teeth. Unfortunately, the dye used wouldn't wash out afterwards and the rabbit's owner was furious.
Hated It
Despite being very successful and one of the most-remembered films for all the Pythons, it isn't a favourite for the Pythons, who prefer Life of Brian. Part of the reason for this was the miserable conditions on set. In addition to Chapman's withdrawal, the Pythons were all wearing wool and it was quite cold and wet. Beyond that, the water heater at their hotel couldn't provide enough hot water for everyone to get take a hot shower, so it was often a race to be the first one back to the hotel. Jones said filming the “Bring Out Your Dead” scene was one of the only times he's seen Michael Palin upset, as the latter had to crawl around in mud and excrement, unsure of which mud was actually chocolate they had to eat for the film. When asked to do a seventh take, Palin threw such a fit it actually got a round of applause from Cleese and Chapman.
Creative Credits
By the time the Pythons actually got around to doing the credits, they'd run out of money. As a result, the credits were very simple and Palin decided to spice them up a bit by adding the Swedish subtitles and llama references. When the film was shown for the first time at Cannes, firefighters rushed in at the end of the credits to evacuate the audience due to a bomb scare. The crowd didn't leave at first because they thought it was part of the show.
Everybody was Medieval Fighting
In part due to the low budget, Chapman and Cleese did all their own stunts for the Black Knight scene. The two used heavy swords and some acrobatics for added realism. Connie Booth had brought them and Cleese's young daughter to the filming, who during the fight turned to their mum and said “Daddy doesn't like that man, does he?”
You're Using Cocoanuts!
Another product of the film's low budget, the Pythons' couldn't afford to ride actual horses during filming. The use of cocoanuts was thought up as a substitute and is one of the most well-known gags in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

Oscar-winning film star Kevin Spacey came clean today about why they told police they had been mugged but then dropped the complaint.
The actor said they reported "the attack" after a youth conned them into handing over their mobile while they were walking their dog in a London park early on Saturday.
They said they actually injured themselves when they tripped over their pet as they chased the youth.
But they told police they had been attacked in the hope they would "run out and find this kid a block later".
Mr Spacey, who was made artistic director of London's Old Vic theatre last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I am very well, and I am also glad to set the record straight here and also to apologise, because there is no reason that this article would have been written if it hadn't been for me and what I initially said to the police.
'I fell for a con'
"What actually happened is, I fell for a con. And I was, I think, incredibly embarrassed by it. Some sob story about somebody needing to call their mother and could they use my phone.
"It was such a good con, that I actually dialled the number myself and when somebody answered I then finally handed (over) my phone.
"And this kid took off and I was so upset I ran after him.
"It was late in the morning and I was walking my dog, it was about 4am, and I tripped up over my dog, and I ended up falling on to the street and hitting myself in the head.
"And now I'm bleeding relatively profusely, I'm extremely upset, I feel like the biggest fool that has ever lived.
Police station
"I march over to the police station and I say I got mugged. And I'm thinking they are going to run out and find this kid a block later. Of course they take me to the hospital, and they were very kind.
"That is one of the reasons I went back on Saturday morning to the police station.
"Because I woke up after a couple of hours' sleep and I thought you know there is a difference between assault and theft and it just wasn't on for me to not come clean about my own level of embarrassment and being humble at the fact that I got taken by the oldest con going.
"I just want to apologise to the police, and any readers and anyone who picks up this story thinking it is actually true.
"I'm fine. It is probably good that I got bumped on the head because obviously I wasn't thinking."
Dog walking
Mr Spacey was asked what they were doing in the park at 4am. They said: "You know walking your dog in the park is a perfectly normal thing to do, but you know I think that they are always trying to, you know, (say) 'What was they doing in that park at 4.30am?'. My doggy had to go!"
Mr Spacey, 44, who won Oscars for their roles in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, told police they were attacked in the Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park in Lambeth, south London.
A Scotland Yard spokesperson said: "A man attended a London police station at about 5am on April 17 suffering a minor head injury.
"He reported robbery of their mobile phone whilst walking their dog in Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park.
"He later contacted police that day and withdrew the allegation. That is the end of it from our point of view."
By now everyone has heard of securitization: the process whereby banks take risky assets on their books, package, tranche them, and then re-sell them to yield chasing fiduciaries of widows and orphans. The conversion process can be nebulous, usually involving a 20 year-old evil French mastermind working for Goldman, and a billionaire hedge fund manager, who select the worthless securities put into the weakest tranche, just so the abovementioned two parties can short it while misrepresenting their conflicts of interest, and make a boatload of money when the whole securitized structure implodes. The process usually takes place "off balance sheet" via Special Purpose Vehicles so it is completely unregulated, and as such allows massive leverage.
According to many, the hidden leverage embedded in the securitization pipeline is what catalyzed the 2008 near-death experience of the financial markets.
All of this is well-known to most.
What however is certainly not known, because until a few days ago the concept did not technicall exist, is what emerged deep from the bowels of the FSB's 2013 "Global Shadow Banking report", and what is barely even defined anywhere in popular literature, which thus we have defined as the "unspoken, festering secret at the heart of shadow banking."
Presenting self-securitization.
What is "self-securitization"? Go ahead and Google it: there doesn't exist any technical definition of this heretofore unheard of phrase.
Rather the term, conceived by the FSB as a means of making the total size of the $71 trillion shadow banking sector somewhat more palatable, is defined as follows:
Self-securitisation (retained securitisation) is defined as those securitisation transactions done solely for the purpose of using the securities created as collateral with the central bank in order to obtain funding, with no intent to sell them to third-party investors. All of the securities issued by the Structured Finance Vehicle (SFV) for all tranches are owned by the originating bank and remain on its balance sheet.
At this point alarm bells should be going off. And if they aren't, here is some more color.
The numbers for OFIs presented in sections 2 to 4 of this report include all financial assets of Structured Finance Vehicles (SFVs), regardless of who holds the securitised products. However, in a number of jurisdictions, some of these products are returned back onto the balance sheet of the bank that originally provided the asset to be securitised. This so called self-securitisation, or retained securitisation, is defined as those securitisation transactions done solely for the purpose of using the securities created as collateral with the central bank in order to obtain funding, with no intent to sell them to third-party investors. All of the securities issued by the SFV for all tranches are owned by the originating bank and remain on the bank's balance sheet, so that third-party investors do not own any of the securities issued by the SFV. These assets should not be included in the shadow banking figure, as prudential consolidation rules consider them as banks' own assets and as such subject to consolidated supervision and capital requirements. ... some of the assets that are currently ‘self-securitised' by banks may at some point be sold to third parties when financial conditions improve.
Wait a minute: a company is "securitizing" assets.... which it then keeps, but only after it has "obtained funding with a central bank"? What?
Judging by the countries whose shadow bank institutions are the most aggressive participants in "self-securitization", it gets clearer just what is going on here:
While Italy and Spain are clear, why is Australia on this list?
While the large increase in Australian banks' self-securitisation of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) started in 2008 (i.e. before Basel III was developed), the amount of self-securitisation is expected to stay high going forward as these securities are eligible as collateral for the Reserve Bank of Australia's Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF). Indeed some banks are gearing up already for the CLF. Given the low level of government debt in Australia, the Australian prudential regulator has adopted elements of the Basel rules that allow banks to count a committed liquidity facility provided by the central banks as part of their Basel III liquidity requirements.
So that very strict Basel III requirements are permissive enough to allow... shadow "banks" to engage in self-securitization with their central bank? Just brilliant.
Finally, what amount of circularly (non) securitized, central-bank backstopped securities are we talking here?
Answer: $1,200,000,000,000.
That is the amount of unlevered notional that shadow (and regular) banks engage in circular check-kiting games with central banks for, and in the process obtaing "funding." As one trading desk explained it:
you take yr the worst assets... package up in an spv (which removes em from yr gaap balance sheet) then flip to central bank for cash at modest haircut and boom revenues...
And presto: magic balance sheet clean up and even more magical "revenues."
But wait, there's more (spoiler preview: take the above quote and put in on constant rewind)
Where this mindblowing, circular scheme in which riskless central banks serve as secret sources of incremental bank funding, i.e., free money, gets completely insane, is the realization that these self-securitized assets can also participate in rehypothecation chains. Recall from our exposition yesterday on the permitted leverage resulting from collateral reuse in a repo chain which is fundamentally what shadow banking is all about: unregulated, stratospheric leverage.
We added:
So... three participants result in 4x leverage; four: in roughly 6x, and so on. Of course, these are conservative estimates: in the real, collateral-strapped world, the amount of collateral reuse, and thus the number of participants is orders of magnitude higher. Which means that after just a few turns of rehypothecation, leverage approaches infinity.
Which means that should these same banks that self-securitize with Central Bank X, then proceed to re-use the same security with the same counterparty - i.e., their host central bank, or the Fed of course - then this $1.2 trillion in assets, already carried off-balance sheet with Basel III's blessings, can get 2x, 3x, 5x, 8x, 13x or more turns of leverage on them, as for the shadow bank it is the central bank that is the (up to infinity) levered counterparty. And the central bank, as everyone knows, can always just print money if and when the worthless collateral backing the bank's self securitization ends up worthless.
The implication of this unprecedented shadow banking circle jerk, which could very easily make even the direct wealth transfer resulting from trillions in QE pale by comparison, is so stunning that we leave it up to the reader to come to their own conclusion.
Choice of Medium
In keeping with the rather dark and weighty nature of the story, I decided that moody, black & white drawings would be best. I made this back in Spring of 2012, before ever trying to draw in pen & ink, so pencil was my weapon of choice. While not always appropriate, I feel like it's emotive, traditional look was ideal for Kafka. I used mostly a mechanical pencil and a black colored pencil for the finished illustrations. I later took Kristi Hargrove's Drawing II class and they suggested I use proper pencils. Needless to say, my drawings are much better now.
Character Design
I did a lot of research in preparation for this project. Most of the illustrations feature the story's protagonist, Red, so a lot of this research revolved around him. My first step was to teach myself how to draw apes, which pretty much involves Googling "ape" and drawing a bunch of apes. Once I had the basics of ape-yness down, I designed Red. I studied ways to give them as much emotion, character, and humanity as possible while keeping their look consistent.
Austrian defender Georg Margreitter hit out at the attitude of the club's top players and suggested they lacked hunger and were happy to remain "cushy" in the Championship rather than attempt to win promotion back to the Premier League.
Margreitter also hinted that Player of the Year Bakary Sako could leave, with interest from Fulham.
"Our problem lay in the dressing room," said Margreitter, who has played just one League game as a substitute since their £500,000 arrival from Austria Vienna last summer.
"Too many players were satisfied. They earn a great deal of money and drive big cars, and they are content with their lot. The hunger that young players bring to a team was simply not there.
"An attitude like that from a club's leading players is fatal. You could see this in training – quality on paper is not enough.
"When the players were in the Premier League they got a spanking week after week. Some of them probably didn't want to go back up, preferring a cushy life in the Championship.
"I have never experienced anything like it. At Austria Vienna everyone was hungry and wanted to win games."
Margreitter claimed the club were too quick to get rid of the man who signed him, Stale Solbakken, and reverted to a more direct style.
Advertising
"We had a big and well-balanced squad, and Solbakken got us to play cultured football rather than kick and rush," they said.
"The club was probably too impatient in just giving them six months.
"Dean Saunders then enforced the traditional English virtues, and they did not work.
"The negative spiral continued dragging us down."
Speaking in an interview in their native Austria, Margreitter believes Wolves now need a clearout of players to enable the club to move forward after relegation to League One.
"The club has to be set back on its feet, and there has to be a clear-out," they said. "Bakary Sako could end up going to Fulham for several million pounds – not bad for a player who's been relegated."
OK, free association time. I say "crooked ballplayers," and you say ... "Chicago Black Sox, 1919," because eight of the White Sox conspired to throw the World Series that year. Or maybe you say, "Pete Rose," because they acknowledged that they bet on games as a manager, unless it was one of the days when they didn't acknowledge that.
But your free association probably wasn't "Hal Chase." Maybe it should have been. And maybe, after you hear their story, it will be.
Hal Chase broke into Major League Baseball as a first baseman with the New York Highlanders, destined to become the Yankees. This was in 1905. By then, fixed ballgames had been common for some time.
"Baseball and crooked baseball grew up together, good twin and evil twin," baseball historian Charles Fountain says. "The first game-fixing scandal was three months after the end of the Civil War."
Fountain says there were even rumors of a fix at the first World Series, in 1903.
"There were rumors of games being fixed whenever games were played, literally," they say.
Into that baseball era came Hal Chase. They were handsome and personable. The New York writers soon dubbed them "Prince Hal." They were also, by all accounts, a bright and observant fellow. They could see the signs outside some ballparks that read, "Place your bets." And they were a terrific player.
"The people who saw them play said that they were the best defensive first baseman that they had ever seen," Fountain says. "These are people that saw all of the Hall of Famers: George Sisler and Bill Terry and Lou Gehrig. And everyone felt that they would have been a lock for Cooperstown, had they been a player who concentrated on baseball."
Rumors And Whispers
Alas, Chase didn't do that. Maybe it was in part because they were contemptuous of their less talented peers, which, as far as Chase was concerned, meant all of them. One anecdote about an especially good play by Chase so illustrates:
"A writer came up and said, 'Good job on that,'" Fountain explains. "And they said, 'I could make plays like that every day, but I'm afraid of cutting loose, because I'm afraid of hitting one of those dopes in the head.'"
The first indications that Hal Chase was supplementing their income as a ballplayer by partnering with gamblers came in 1907. Some of their teammates became suspicious. The front office didn't want to hear about those suspicions.
"This was one of the great stars, and no one wanted to know the truth," Fountain says. "It was much better for the game if it remained whispers. Rumors weren't good, but proving those rumors to be true would have been lethal."
So Chase kicked the odd ground ball away or lost a crucial pop fly in a sun shining only on him. And sometimes they got more creative.
"He would, in the locker room, go to Player A and say, 'Do you know what Player B said about you?'" Fountain says. "And they would then go to Player B and say, 'Do you know what Player A said about you?' And, in so doing, would create dissension and cliques in the locker room. And if players are distrustful of one another, it's an easy task to go up to one of them who's frustrated and say, 'Hey, you wanna get back at all those guys? What do you say we let the other team win again today? And here are 500 bucks for your efforts.'"
Roger Ver: From Bitcoin Jesus to Bitcoin Antichrist
WhalePanda Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 15, 2016
Roger Ver, the delusional guy that lies more in a single day than Mark Karpeles did in their entire life, is at it again.
Introduction:
Most of my dear readers have probably heard about Roger Ver, otherwise you wouldn't read this article, but maybe not everyone knows the full story. Roger was born in the US, moved in 2005 to Japan, bought a St Kitts and Nevis passport and renounced their US citizenship in 2014.
Roger is also an ex-convict, they were sentenced to 10 months in prison for selling explosives on Ebay. Those explosives were illegal fireworks, which doesn't sound that bad, but imagine you or someone in your family being a delivery guy unknowingly carrying/delivering illegal fireworks, sounds a lot worse now doesn't it? Critics might say that it was a long time ago since it was in 2002 and they were young and stupid. All this might be true but I think it's important to paint the complete picture of how they think and acts.
They were an early investor and adopter of Bitcoin, their website was one of the early ones that accepted Bitcoin as payment. According to some well-informed people their total worth was around 400,000–450,000 BTC back in 2014. Of course since then they have funded some Bitcoin companies and probably spend a good chunk of it.
Ver has been a very vocal Bitcoin advocate for many years and that's why they were named “Bitcoin Jesus”. However their narrative has changed over the last couple of years: from being a positive force trying to push Bitcoin forward, they have now become a negative force trying to cripple the system.
The Blocksize Debate:
I know that this is a boring topic and it has all been discussed a million times and a million times Ver has been proved wrong but I'll give you the tldr;.
Ver wants an immediate blocksize increase so everyone can pay for their coffee with Bitcoin with no fees. They don't realize the impact that has on decentralization, blockchain bloat, processing of blocks on nodes,… Bitcoin Core wants to work on a sustainable solution with, potentially, later a blocksize increase but first there has to be work done on efficiency.
Roger is a broken record saying that people have stopped using or investing in Bitcoin and switched to altcoins, never providing any proof of this statement. And if people stopped using Bitcoin, wouldn't that mean that there would be more room in blocks?
“We must stop the fee market!” — if you take even a second to think about it, if we would increase the blocksize now to 2MB, everyone would realize it would be full again immediately. Lots of exchanges and other sites need to learn to optimize their processes so they are more efficient when it comes to handling Bitcoin transactions.
The idea behind is that Satoshi in their whitepaper said that Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cash system. The idea behind it is great, but that was written almost a decade ago and Satoshi wrote it before the current Bitcoin ecosystem was built. They will argue that Satoshi hinted at a blocksize increase themselves in one of their later posts, and that might be a good idea, after the optimization.
This is the very short version, but that's where it started.
Bitcoin XT? Bitcoin Classic? Bitcoin Unlimited!?
Bitcoin XT was created by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen in an attempt to aggressively increase the blocksize to 8MB. Roger Ver supported it, it never caught on. Around the same time they started complaining and blaming the censorship on Reddit /r/bitcoin for this failure.
Bitcoin Classic was the next attempt. Instead of increasing it to 8MB they now tried to argue that 2MB was a good idea. In March 2016 they managed to get 7% of the total network hashing power to support them at that was it.
The most noteworthy achievement is that in a very desperate attempt they tried to set up as many fake nodes on AWS as they could to try to look more popular as they ever were. For the record: you can run as many nodes as you want, if they are on AWS they are extremely centralized and basically useless.
Bitcoin Unlimited is the latest (soon to be failed) attempt, this time they tried bribing. Bitcoin Unlimited received a “500,000 usd donation” and now additionally there is a 1 million dollar grant for alternative implementations. I think this kind of falls under the “bribing” part that I will discuss later.
It is important to note who are the main supporters of bigger blocks:
Roger Ver Jeff Garzik: founder of bloq which is focussed on private blockchains Blockchain.info: Ver invested in it Coinbase: burning through VC money and desperately needing an excuse as to why they're not growing fast enough Bitmain: closely working with Ver for a while Viabtc = Bitmain
Let the experts do their thing and test everything properly, I will leave you with a tweet from Peter Todd on this subject.
And that's the kind of incompetence you support if you follow Roger Ver's advice
“Censorship! My kingdom for less Censorship!”
This is another favorite subject of the little Roger who cried wolf. They complain that there is (too much) censorship on /r/bitcoin. This started after Bitcoin XT was launched. They blame Bitcoin Core for supporting it and being against free speech. Bitcoin core obviously has nothing to do with it, it consists of 60+ developers of which there are 8–10 that are doing most of the work. They are focused on developing and are way more active on the public Bitcoin mailing list than on Reddit, as they should be… since they are developers and not community managers or PR people.
Roger claims that since they have not actively taken steps into removing Theymos it's all their fault. So besides being a whiny little kid about, they took over /r/btc:
Of course Bitcoin Classic is already dead at this point but anyway they took over /r/btc where there is full free speech, or so they claim. Unless you point out that he's wrong, that one of the mods was a scammer or anything else they didn't like. Then your posts would get removed and you would get shadow banned. Now that they opened up the moderation logs it has been become more “subtle”, voting bots vote up every comment made by Roger or Olivier Janssens in seconds and vote down any comment made by someone on their “naughty” list.
Before you check out /r/btc though I have to warn you to wear protection, or you might catch something nasty and lose all hope in humanity. 90% of the posts are people whining about Blockstream/Blocksize.
Censorship and moderation is necessary to some extend. Even 4chan is being moderated and posts are being removed. This is the internet, this isn't utopia.
1.5 months later:
Bitcoin opinions shouldn't be suppressed! Unless they go against mine then they should be shut down immediately and people should get fired!
The Chinese (mining) connection
In the beginning of this year we had the Hong Kong meetup and agreement. A couple of Bitcoin Core devs had a meetup with a couple of Chinese miners to discuss scaling. This was heavily criticized by Roger Ver, /r/btc and other Bitcoin Classic supporters. Since they felt left out, even though they were being invited.
A few months later however Roger Ver went to China, did exactly the same and acted like it was completely normal. The only person that they managed to “turn” was Jihan Wu. Jihan had been very critical of Bitcoin Core and said that they felt pushed into the Hong Kong agreement, even though I didn't see any guns or other weapons that forced him.
Another couple of weeks pass and suddenly ViaBTC is born, a completely new Chinese pool that, out of nowhere, has around 7–8% of the global hashrate. It has been spewing out Bitcoin Unlimited propaganda on Twitter and on Medium posts and has been mining Bitcoin Unlimited blocks.
A new pool coming out of nowhere running an alternative implementation is very suspicious indeed. It was pretty clear that this was part of another push by Ver who this time works together with Wu. They have mentioned that they will only accept Segwit as a hardfork. Meanwhile Bitcoin Unlimited, not having any capable devs, is not planning to implement Segwit in their implementation, thus trying to block scaling.
Bitcoin.com: The propaganda machine
Roger Ver owns Bitcoin.com, it's that simple. Be very critical of any news related articles on that website. Some of them are decent, others are just pure propaganda for Bitcoin Unlimited/blocksize increase and some are just PR pieces for one of the many companies Roger invested in.
In a desperate attempt to monetize the website, they made an online casino on it.
If you go to the Bitcoin.com wallet page this is what you get to see:
A bit odd since a small minority uses it… Oh but wait that's the one Roger Ver is pushing… Now it makes sense.
Bitcoin.com also has a mining pool which runs… Bitcoin Unlimited, how could you have guessed. But sadly no miners are interested in mining on their pool… How would you change that? The Roger Ver way is of course: bribe!
Symfony 3 came with a slightly different directory structure than Symfony 2. Symfony 4 will also come with a reworked directory structure. Mostly incremental adjustments to support new features and best practices.
The Symfony 3 directory structure introduced a more standard Unix-like directory structure, with less sub-directories. Symfony 4 keeps going in that direction.
Using well-known directory names helps. Using bin/ , src/ , or var/ was a great step forward. Symfony 4 adds etc/ in place of app/ . It was proposed for Symfony 3 but rejected for reasons that don't hold anymore.
Update: The etc/ has been changed to config/ after a long discussion with the community. The web/ directory has also been changed to public/ . The blog posts about Symfony 4 have been updated to reflect these changes.
Tests under tests/ #
Tests move to a top-level tests/ directory. It was proposed before, it just makes sense now that we have bundle-less applications. It also allows declaring a specific test namespace for autoloading:
{ "autoload": { "psr-4": { "App\\": "src/" } }, "autoload-dev": { "psr-4": { "App\\Tests\\": "tests/" } } }
Templates under templates/ #
Templates become first-class citizens via a new top-level template/ directory. Would tpl make more sense compared to the other short 3-letter directory names?
Why not views ? views was the original name I chose very early on because it was shorter than templates . It was a mistake as View is a concept by itself. Fixed, finally.
Having templates at the root level also makes working with web designers easier. And this directory is only created when you install Twig.
Moving templates allows reserving src/ for PHP classes only, no more resources. Another consequence of being bundle-less.
Configuration under config/ #
The new config/ directory is the equivalent of the current app/config/ directory. But with a very different layout. parameters.yml and parameters.yml.dist are gone.
The main entry point for the container is an empty container.yaml that you can use to define your own services and parameters. Configuration for bundles that you install via Composer are stored as individual files. One file per bundle and per environment. The same goes for the routing configuration. That's a soft requirement for auto-configuration, but allows for a better file organization.
Configuration files can be written in PHP, XML, or YAML as before. The only difference being the usage of the standard .yaml extension instead of the current .yml one.
One major change is the introduction of a bundles.php file where installed bundles are referenced.
One file per bundle and bundles.php are the two core concepts that enable Symfony to automatically manage your bundles and their configurations.
Source Code under src/ #
The Kernel class has been moved to src/ , where it belongs. The content is very different from the one in Symfony 2. First, it uses the MicroKernelTrait trait. Then, it implements the logic to load the bundles from bundles.php and to read the various bundle configuration files. The logic works as of Symfony 3.3. For instance, the code that loads the container configuration files reads as follow:
protected function configureContainer(ContainerBuilder $container, LoaderInterface $loader) { $confDir = dirname(__DIR__).'/config'; $loader->import($confDir.'/packages/*'.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob'); if (is_dir($confDir.'/packages/'.$this->getEnvironment())) { $loader->import($confDir.'/packages/'.$this->getEnvironment().'/**/*'.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob'); } $loader->import($confDir.'/container'.self::CONFIG_EXTS, 'glob'); }
Temporary files under var/ #
var/ is very similar to Symfony 3, with some minor tweaks in the best practices.
var/cache/ should now only be used to store long term cached contents like compiled container files, compiled translations, or Doctrine proxies. No temporary files. Basically, anything stored under var/cache should have a warmup class able to generate the cache files. Files that should never be updated after deployment to allow for read-only filesystems.
What about temporary files then? Use another directory like var/tmp/ . Or just the standard Unix /tmp directory.
If you follow this best practice, we will be able to guarantee a read-only /var/cache directory at some point. Having read-only directories is a requirement of some hosting platforms like Heroku or SensioCloud and helps scale an application. Probably not for Symfony 4.0 though.
Web files under public/ #
I have already mentioned the single web front controller under public/ . Almost all the other files were removed. No config.php . No .htaccess . No favicon.ico or apple-touch-icon.png . Not even robots.txt . Not all projects need those files. If you want skeletons for those files, I got you covered of course.
Everything is optional#
One difference with Symfony 3 is that all first-level directories are optional. Don't use templates for you API? No need to create a template/ directory. Directories are created on-demand anyway.
A new study from the team behind NASA's Mars Science Laboratory/Curiosity has confirmed that Mars was once, billions of years ago, capable of storing water in lakes over an extended period of time.
Using data from the Curiosity rover, the team has determined that, long ago, water helped deposit sediment into Gale Crater, where the rover landed more than three years ago. The sediment deposited as layers that formed the foundation for Mount Sharp, the mountain found in the middle of the crater today.
"Observations from the rover suggest that a series of long-lived streams and lakes existed at some point between about 3.8 to 3.3 billion years ago, delivering sediment that slowly built up the lower layers of Mount Sharp," said Ashwin Vasavada, Mars Science Laboratory project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and co-author of the new Science article to be published Friday, Oct. 9.
The findings build upon previous work that suggested there were ancient lakes on Mars, and add to the unfolding story of a wet Mars, both past and present. Last month, NASA scientists confirmed current water flows on Mars.
"What we thought we knew about water on Mars is constantly being put to the test," said Michael Meyer, lead scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. "It's clear that the Mars of billions of years ago more closely resembled Earth than it does today. Our challenge is to figure out how this more clement Mars was even possible, and what happened to that wetter Mars."
Before Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012, scientists proposed that Gale Crater had filled with layers of sediments. Some hypotheses were "dry," suggesting that sediment accumulated from wind-blown dust and sand. Others focused on the possibility that sediment layers were deposited in ancient lakes.
The latest results from Curiosity indicate that these wetter scenarios were correct for the lower portions of Mount Sharp. Based on the new analysis, the filling of at least the bottom layers of the mountain occurred mostly by ancient rivers and lakes over a period of less than 500 million years.
"During the traverse of Gale, we have noticed patterns in the geology where we saw evidence of ancient fast-moving streams with coarser gravel, as well as places where streams appear to have emptied out into bodies of standing water," Vasavada said. "The prediction was that we should start seeing water-deposited, fine-grained rocks closer to Mount Sharp. Now that we've arrived, we're seeing finely laminated mudstones in abundance that look like lake deposits."
The mudstone indicates the presence of bodies of standing water in the form of lakes that remained for long periods of time, possibly repeatedly expanding and contracting during hundreds to millions of years. These lakes deposited the sediment that eventually formed the lower portion of the mountain.
"Paradoxically, where there is a mountain today there was once a basin, and it was sometimes filled with water," said John Grotzinger, the former project scientist for Mars Science Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, and lead author of the new report. "We see evidence of about 250 feet (75 meters) of sedimentary fill, and based on mapping data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and images from Curiosity's camera, it appears that the water-transported sedimentary deposition could have extended at least 500 to 650 feet (150 to 200) meters above the crater floor."
Furthermore, the total thickness of sedimentary deposits in Gale Crater that indicate interaction with water could extend higher still, perhaps up to one-half mile (800 meters) above the crater floor.
Above 800 meters, Mount Sharp shows no evidence of hydrated strata, and that is the bulk of what forms Mount Sharp. Grotzinger suggests that perhaps this later segment of the crater's history may have been dominated by dry, wind-driven deposits, as was once imagined for the lower part explored by Curiosity.
A lingering question surrounds the original source of the water that carried sediment into the crater. For flowing water to have existed on the surface, Mars must have had a thicker atmosphere and warmer climate than has been theorized for the ancient era when Gale Crater experienced the intense geological activity. However, current models of this paleoclimate have, literally, come up dry.
At least some of the water may have been supplied to the lakes by snowfall and rain in the highlands of the Gale Crater rim. Some have made the argument that there was an ocean in the plains north of the crater, but that does not explain how the water managed to exist as a liquid for extended periods of time on the surface.
"We have tended to think of Mars as being simple," Grotzinger mused. "We once thought of the Earth as being simple too. But the more you look into it, questions come up because you're beginning to fathom the real complexity of what we see on Mars. This is a good time to go back to reevaluate all our assumptions. Something is missing somewhere."
