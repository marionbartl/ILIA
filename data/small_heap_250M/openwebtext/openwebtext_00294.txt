This woman is TED Talk gold; someone please get her booked. On Tuesday evening, we hosted Vicki Hoefle, author of Duct Tape Parenting: A Less Is More Approach to Raising Respectful, Responsible, & Resilient Kids, and wow, was she fantastic. This was one of our best-received events ever, and that is saying something.
Hoefle gives a very funny, very thoughtful and persuasive presentation on how to quiet down, step back, and let go of the kinds of control that hinder children instead of helping. The goal is to learn who your children are, so you can help them become self-sufficient and able to cope with frustrations, disappointments, and the myriad other challenges life will throw at them.
Hoefle admitted that when her three children were young, she was a tad, well, controlling. She liked to be organized, she dreaded potential chaos, and she wanted things to run smoothly. From the moment the alarm clock rang, she said, she realized she was doing a lot of talking to her children, constantly, all day long. “It's exhausting for everybody. No wonder kids stop listening,” she said.
The parenting books she turned to then offered tips, timeouts, counting to three, and a lot of other parenting techniques that addressed the symptoms, but not the causes, of the power struggles and communication disjuncture between parents and kids. Finally, she said, “I came to realize that I wanted a life in relationship with my children, not a series of strategies to control their behavior so I could have my life.”
So she started to take stock. “If I really can't direct every moment, what will happen?” She realized she didn't have faith in her kids to figure out how to do things, how to cooperate with each other, how to handle situations that go awry.
Because she was such a talker, she literally duct-taped her mouth shut as a reminder to be quiet, to listen and observe from the background. What she found was fascinating. Some things went really well and some things fell apart. By removing herself from the situation, she was better able to assess what skills her children had, how resilient they were, who blamed whom when trouble broke out, how often they came to her to solve problems they could actually solve themselves, how they worked together.
She realized that by being in their business all the time, her message to them had been, “Hey, you guys don't know how to navigate life. I do, so you are going to sit on the sidelines and watch while I do your life.”
She also realized that she had been something of a hypocrite, by wanting her young ones to achieve standards of behavior that she herself couldn't live up to. “I'm allowed to say whatever I want to say in whatever tone I wish, to have bad days and be tired and not get things done. I had fewer expectations for myself than I did for them. As I became quieter and more thoughtful, I realized that I needed to model human interactions. We are their blueprints.”
It isn't easy to be a duct tape parent, especially if you are an organized, in-control person. “If you let me run your life, I will,” she said. “I need real tangible things to keep me honest. So I always had duct tape on the counter. I empowered the kids, telling them: when I go back to my old ways, go get the duct tape and put a piece on the counter as a reminder that I am overstepping my bounds. I stepped back and gave them a chance. And do you know what happened? I ended up raising five young adults as respectful as any five people I know, because they had an equitable relationship, and a respectful way to communicate.”
Hoefle has been leading parenting workshops for two decades. She says, those workshops usually start with parents asking, “How do I get my kids to…?” Instead, she suggests, the question we might want to ask is, “What will it take to raise a child who is willing to get up with the alarm clock, who doesn't react to frustration by hitting their brother, who will invest in their own education?”
She talked about a generation of “helicopter-parented” kids, who, upon entering college, find themselves at a loss without adults doing things for them and telling them what to do. “The worst thing for a child is to feel like you need an adult in order to figure out what to do. Then the fear is always there.” Our job is to raise kids who think of themselves as competent, capable; kids who know that their parents believe in them.
One of the most wonderful, touching, and bittersweet parts of Hoefle's talk was to trace the path of children's attempts to become self-sufficient and how we unwittingly derail them. When babies learn something new, we applaud and cheer each achievement. And then pretty much the moment they learn to walk and have their hands free and start trying to use those little hands to help out, what's the first thing we do? Start wailing, “Nooooooo!!! It's too sharp! That's too pointy! You'll break it! You're going to get hurt!” And so on. And we take over tasks for them. “We talk them out of it. ‘I'm an adult and I can do it faster, so I'll do it.' It mucks up a child's growth and more importantly, it mucks up our relationship with our kids.”
The best thing about Hoefle's approach is that it doesn't depend on bribes, threats, or rewards. It's about mutual respect and real communication. “Parents want to cultivate a relationship with their kids that will last forever. There are subtle shifts they can make in order to create the life they hoped for with their kids.”
It was a wonderful evening, and two parents attended just to raise their hands during the Q&A to thank Hoefle for her role in their lives. Hoefle is a Vermonter, and these women had each attended her workshops, years ago. Both said she had changed the course of their parenting styles, and each was positively tearful with gratitude. It was powerful.
This was one of the liveliest, most fun, and common-sense-filled discussions I've had the pleasure of hosting, and there are a LOT of parents into whose hands I wish to press this book.
My only quibble is an editorial one; I miss the hyphens that would seem to belong in the title and subtitle. Duct-Tape Parenting: A Less-Is-More Approach to Raising Respectful, Responsible, & Resilient Kids. Ahh, now everything is perfect.
Recent election practices by the UBC Student Union Okanagan (UBCSUO) are being called into question, after students reported on-going concerns during the election process.
A petition signed by over 300 people is calling for a re-vote, after complaints were filed during the first day of voting in the UBCSUO election.
UBC Okanagan student Jaclyn Salter said on Wednesday, March 16th, the first day of voting, she noticed some major flaws in the electoral process. Several students received two ballots for a single person, while others did not receive any ballot for specific positions.
Voting was also held outside in the central courtyard of campus, leading some candidates to campaign just outside of the voting area. Salter said there was also no privacy while students cast their ballot, meaning no dividers were set up and there was no restriction to the number of students who could vote at one time.
Salter said she and several other students emailed the Chief Returning Officer (CRO), who is responsible for all aspects of the election, regarding the issues they witnessed on Wednesday. She received an email back stating “Your words have been received, documented, and steps have been made to alleviate your concerns with the process.”
“As far as I can tell, many of the problems were addressed on Thursday,” said Salter.
“However, that doesn't make Wednesday's vote any more legitimate.”
According to UBCSUO Union Regulations, a number of the complaints filed to the CRO violate their own constitution. Under “Elections and Referenda Regulations,” Part 4: Campaigns and Candidate Conduct, section 19 (iii) states “candidates may campaign by any means except not within the proximity of polling location.”
The regulations also states that “the voting place will be arranged in such a way as to allow the Members (students) to cast their ballots in secret.”
“If this is not addressed, the people elected this year will be illegitimate and will not represent the students of UBCO fairly,” Salter wrote on her petition.
After Wednesday and Thursday's vote, the Presidential Race resulted in a tie, leading to a re-vote that will occur on Monday.
A statement shared on the UBCSUO Facebook page said the union will be launching a full investigation and inquiry and will issue an official response following the re-vote Monday.
The UBCO Administration has also stepped in to address the concerns. Students received a public noticed from Student Senator, Shira Sneg stating that “if the results were found to be corrupted, a revote would need to take place for every position, not just for that of the President."
A re-vote is exactly what Salter believes should happen. While she is encouraging students to sign her petition, UBCO students are also being asked to email their concerns to the Associate Vice-President of Students within the next few days explaining their experience during the voting.
“I'm grateful that the administration has been informed and are taking an interest. Having a neutral arbitrator will be really beneficial in negotiation what will hopefully be a re-vote.”
UBCSUO said the 2016 election was the highest voter turnout in years. The student union represents over 8,500 students.
President George W. Bush has not thus far granted many pardons, but he has been generous in coming to the aid of one particular constituency group: S&L executives and others who swindled thrifts in the mid-1980's. A few of these guys, coincidentally no doubt, hail from Texas.
So far Bush pardons have gone to:
John G. Smith, “a former officer of Vernon Savings and Loan, a Dallas thrift that collapsed in 1987 after making millions of dollars in bad loans.” Kenneth Foner, who had been convicted of “conspiracy to impede the functions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.” and committing “embezzlement as a bank officer.” David McCall Jr., “a former Plano, Texas, mayor who was pardoned on his deathbed [in 2004] for his role in a savings and loan fraud case.” Mark Hale of Henderson, Texas, an S&L executive who had been sentenced to three years in jail for fraud of at least $5 million. William Hoyle McCright Jr. of Midland, Texas, who was sentenced in 1986 to two years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine for making “false entries, books, reports or statements of bank.” McCright, who just got his pardon yesterday, was a minor donor ($300) to John McCain's presidential campaign.
So Bush is handing out pardons to a group of people who helped produce the last financial system meltdown just as a new crop are under investigation.

RIYADH (Reuters) - At least two people have died in flash floods in Saudi Arabia's second city of Jeddah after heavy rain, the country's civil defence said on Tuesday.
It urged residents to stay indoors and said schools would remain closed on Wednesday.
Flooding is politically sensitive in Jeddah, where previous incidents have prompted widespread anger over the perceived failure of local and national government to build suitable defences and to prevent illegal housing developments in risky areas.
Footage and photographs shown on Saudi-owned al-Arabiya television pictured cars being swept along Jeddah streets and people using boats to navigate districts of the city.
The two deaths were caused by electrocution from a lamp post as people attempted to cross a flooded street. Two children have also been reported missing in northern Saudi Arabia.
Heavy rain struck other western, northern and central parts of Saudi Arabia, including Mecca and Medina, Hail and Arar, the civil defence said. Wet weather is forecast to continue in coming days.
Steve Bannon at the White House on April 20. Mark Wilson/Getty Images
Rotating siren news about former Breitbart chairman and nationalist White House adviser Steve Bannon, who has close ties to the white supremacist movement responsible for last week's violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, emerged moments ago from the Drudge Report:
But then Jake Tapper at CNN said it wasn't actually clear where things stood:
Source close to Bannon: he's prepared to continue fighting for POTUS's agenda inside or outside; doesn't know what decision has been made. — Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) August 18, 2017
Maggie Haberman of the New York Times seemed to have it confirmed:
Bannon going - admin officials say it was Trump, people close to Bannon insist he resigned. https://t.co/XuOvPjZN37 — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) August 18, 2017
But then … what?
Steve Bannon just told me he resigned from the White House two weeks ago @POTUS #Bannon — Sara A. Carter (@SaraCarterDC) August 18, 2017
Let's just assume that “Steve Bannon no longer works at the White House” is an appropriate takeaway from all that given that rumors of his imminent departure had been reported by Axios earlier Friday. The Axios report and a just-published New York Times article list a number of reasons why Bannon has lost favor with Trump: He argues too much with National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, he maintains a high profile in the media that makes Trump jealous, he advocates a populist economic policy that's at odds with the trickle-down conservatism of other advisers, Jared Kushner thinks he's too much of a hard-liner, and so forth. You'll note that nowhere among those reasons are “he's the country's leading enabler of the white supremacist movement,” but that's Trump for you. In any case, the white supremacists will now have to make do with the 1 billion other connections they have to the administration.
Gabriel Sherman of New York magazine reports that Bannon is expected to return to Breitbart. You haven't heard the last from Steve Bannon (about what crimes immigrants and black people are doing), America!
Update, 1:25 p.m.:
Bannon friend says Breitbart ramping up for war against Trump. "It's now a Democrat White House," source says. — Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) August 18, 2017
This should be fun! (“Fun.”)
(Newser) – When Steve Easton was about seven years old, his parents noticed that the suction cup was missing from one of his toy darts, and they were worried he had inhaled or swallowed it. So they took him to the hospital, but doctors couldn't find anything. Yet for decades, he's suffered from sniffles and headaches he thought were a result of allergies. Now, more than four decades later, it turns out his childhood doctors were wrong, the Guardian reports. In what must have been a powerful sneeze—accompanied by what he calls "a very uncomfortable sensation"—the suction cup emerged from a 51-year-old Easton's nose.
"I started a sneezing fit and it came out of my left nostril,” the British man says. “I thought, 'What's this? Where the hell has this come from?' and pulled out this rubber sucker." Easton called his mom, who told him about the hospital visit—which he had apparently forgotten. Doctors at the time said perhaps she was mistaken about her son inhaling the suction cup, she notes. "I knew it wasn't [a mistake] and it's always worried me, and now it has suddenly shot out. We are all shocked." Easton's current doctor doesn't think the dart caused any problems. It did, however, become a good conversation piece, and Easton toted it around for a while before he threw it away, the BBC reports. As for his nose, "it doesn't feel any different" now, he notes. (In more disturbing nasal news, a woman says a sneeze killed her sister.)
Like a brush fire kicking up in America's southwest, the storm brought on by Donald Trump's political bombast threatens to scorch all it touches as Republicans brace for fallout from their rival's remarks.
The billionaire tycoon's caustic, seemingly unrehearsed comments about Mexican immigrants, uttered when he launched his White House campaign in mid-June, sparked immigration debates and triggered questions about the braggadocio of a candidate unafraid to disparage fellow Republicans, and whether it hurts the party's chances in 2016.
His business interests have taken a hit, with Univision, NBC and retailer Macy's severing ties with Trump after the mogul saidMexico was sending “rapists” and other criminals into the United States.
But his political profile — fuelled by non-stop media coverage in recent weeks — has risen substantially.
“The Donald,” as he is sometimes nicknamed, has emerged as the number-two contender, behind Jeb Bush, in recent polls by CNN and Fox.
“He's huge right now,” Gregory Valliere, chief political strategist at the non-partisan Potomac Research Group, told AFP.
“He'll make more astounding gaffes and eventually self-destruct, but that could take a while.”
The party's leadership has sought to douse the flames, with Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus calling Trump this week, discussing Trump's comments about illegal immigration and apparently urging him to tone down the rhetoric.
But Trump has kept at it, doubling down on his message, boasting to NBC News that, “Frankly, if I didn't bring it up, you wouldn't even be talking about immigration right now.”
Bush, whose wife is from Mexico, denounced Trump's views as “way out of the mainstream.” Candidate Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, said he was “offended” by Trump's remarks.
– ‘Enormous' danger –
Trump was scheduled to address the controversial issue again Saturday in the border state of Arizona, where his event has been moved to a larger venue due to overwhelming demand, according to his campaign.
But Arizona's Senator John McCain is shunning Trump and won't be there. On Friday the 2008 Republican nominee, who in 2013 helped lead ultimately failed efforts at comprehensive immigration reform, dismissed the ongoing debate as a “circus” which “sows division within our country and damages the Republican Party.”
The party led an exhaustive post-mortem on its 2012 election defeat, and concluded that it needed to reach out more to Hispanics, who enjoy increasing clout in presidential elections, if it wanted a shot at reclaiming the White House.
Analysts and observers warn that Trump's bluster might jeopardize such efforts.
“This has become an area of concern for the Republican Party, even if Trump's candidacy goes nowhere or he quits,” said Professor Peter Kastor, who chairs the history department at Washington University in St Louis and studies the presidency.
“It doesn't help the Republican brand.”
Trump has floated the idea of running as a third-party candidate, something that could give Republican strategists nightmares.
The move would recall the challenges of fellow billionaire Ross Perot, who split the Republican vote and helped Bill Clinton win in 1992, and Ralph Nader, who was accused of acting as spoiler in 2000 when George W. Bush narrowly defeated Al Gore.
“Almost every election in the 20th century featured the fear of an out-of-control candidate,” Kastor said. “They've never won, but they do have an impact.”
That theory will be tested August 6, when Republicans hold their debut debate.
The Republican field will feature 16 candidates, but Fox News, which broadcasts the debate live, has said only Republicans polling in the top 10 make the stage. If current numbers hold, Trump will be among them.
With a displayed willingness to eviscerate rival candidates, Trump could be an “enormous” danger in debates, Valliere said.
Other participants “risk losing any ability to control where the debate's going, because everyone is stuck revolving around Donald Trump,” added Kastor. “The other side of this is that ratings soar.”
Despite being one of the most famous people in America, with enviable business acumen and pledges to get tough on nations like China, Trump will not win the nomination, insisted Karlyn Bowman, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
“He just has too many weaknesses.”
In the end, Bowman added, he could eventually bow out by saying, “‘It's time for me to go back to concentrating on business.'”
I've had owls on my mind since Sunday.
News articles are still talking about Superb owl highlights, social media was all atwitter talking about the Superb owl, and my friends even threw a Superb owl party, even though they're not usually into that sort of thing.
So, let's talk about owls. Did you know that a group of owls is called a parliament? Or that owls can be found on every continent except Antarctica? They're actually really fascinating creatures, and there's more to them than can be covered in one blog post.
But for now, let's talk about what makes owls truly superb animals.
Huge eyes
Owls' eyes are completely immobile. Instead of having eyeballs, like humans do, their eyes are more like tubes, elongated and held in place by sclerotic rings. Their eyes are forward facing, so this ends up giving them binocular vision that fully focuses on their prey and boosts depth perception. Owls have extraordinary night vision and can spot prey up to half a mile away—but this comes at a cost: owls are farsighted, meaning they can't clearly see things close to their eyes. (If they had reading glasses, they'd be unstoppable.)
But my, what big eyes they have—all the better for seeing their prey in the dark. Because owls' eyes are so big, they have a larger surface area to collect light than other animals. Owls have more rod cells than other animals, and—as recently explained in more detail in my post "5 things you didn't know about how animals see color"—these rod cells help them see in the dark.
Owls also have a structure at the back of each eye called the tapetum lucidum. Basically, light goes into the owls' eyes and hits the rod cells. It then bounces off of the tapetum lucidum to hit the rod cells again, letting the owl see the light twice instead of just once, which effectively turns the night into day for them. Pretty nifty, right?
Finally, owls have three eyelids: one for blinking, one for sleeping, and one for keeping their eyes clean.
Swivel necks
Because owls can't move their eyes, their necks make up for this by being able to swivel a full 270 degrees. It's not quite the full 360 degrees that a cartoon might depict, but it's pretty impressive nonetheless.
If you think about it, though, being able to rotate your neck that far seems kind of nuts. How is this even physically possible? Well, for one thing, owls have a blood-pooling system that collects blood to power their brains and eyes when neck movement cuts off circulation. For another, owls have twice the number of neck vertebrae as other birds: most birds, like humans, have 7 vertebrae, whereas owls have 14. They also have air-cushioned vessel casings so they don't rupture a blood vessel when snapping their neck around to look over their shoulders.
Asymmetric ears
Many owl species have asymmetrical ears. Sometimes this means that their ears are different sizes, and other times it means they're located at different heights on the owl's head.
When the ears are at different heights, it enables them to receive sound at slightly different times, thus pinpointing the location of sounds in multiple dimensions: when a sound is equally loud in both ears, the owl knows it has zeroed in on the source and distance of its prey.
Some species of owl also have a moveable ear flap that they can use to increase or decrease the sound coming to their ears. (Not to be confused with "ear tufts" [pictured on the right], which are adorable but are not actually related to an owl's hearing at all.)
Their flattened faces and the feathers around their faces also funnel sound to the ears, magnifying it so that they can detect even the slightest sound from tiny prey.
So how good is their hearing? A great gray owl sitting on a fencepost can locate a vole running in a tunnel 60 feet away under 18 inches of snow.
Yeah. Maybe don't mess with owls.
Iron grip
Owls have a reversible outer toe that can be pointed forward or backward, depending on the owl's position, to ensure a secure hold on its prey. They also have the ability to lock their toes around an object so that they don't need to continually contract their muscles.
Those are some steel-grip toes right there. Once an owl has caught its prey, that prey isn't going anywhere.
Stealth feathers
Last, but certainly not least, let's talk about owl wings, which are fascinating and inspiring in their own right. They differ from other birds' wings in that they're wider, allowing for more gliding and less flapping—i.e., less noise—but that's not what's so cool about them.
Owls actually have feathers that are different from other birds' for the specific purpose of being stealthy. Along the leading edges of the primary flight feathers are stiff fringes, like the teeth of a comb, and on the trailing edges of the same feathers are soft fringes, more like the frayed edges of a torn piece of cloth. (Check out the above video for a demonstration of the difference between owl feathers and other birds' feathers.) These differently textured feathers serve to break up the wind and reduce turbulence, thus reducing the sound the wings make.
Owl wings are also covered in fluffy down feathers, kind of like velvety fur, that dampen sound even more. These soft feathers absorb high frequency sounds that most prey are sensitive to. The end result is a silent flier that can sneak up on its prey at night, relying more on stealth than on speed.
So to recap, owls have great night vision, specialized swivel necks, incredible hearing, an iron grip, and wings specifically built for stealth. Pretty superb, wouldn't you agree?
I don't usually unleash a knee-slapping howl of laughter listening to Stephen Harper.
But I had to guffaw after the prime minister delivered this straight-faced verdict on Sen. Mike Duffy on Thursday.
“It is clearly inappropriate to try and collect travel expenses when one is living at a residence he or she has had for many, many years,” he told the Commons.
Seriously prime minister? You didn't know Mike Duffy lived in Ottawa and was a let's-pretend Prince Edward Islander when you appointed him? You never peered over your office balcony to see him hosting a politics show in the foyer of the House of Commons?
Willful blindness goes to the heart of the unfairness which bothers so many senators. The Prime Minister's Office knew Duffy was pureblood Ottawa. They endorsed his collection of housing subsidies for a P.E.I. cottage. They didn't object until it was a media story. And then they picked up pitchforks to drive him from office along with Senators Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau.
Deliberate ignorance explains a prime minister in the dark about the Nigel Wright payoff while at least a dozen of his staff hatch the scheme. But it cannot explain away the PMO's blessing for Duffy's housing subsidies.
Thus we have a government proudly promoting law, order and victims' rights now practicing retroactive persecution without representation and harsh sentencing without appeal. In the cradle of democracy, an injustice is flourishing.
It's entirely possible Harper will win the day. His non-negotiable imposition of capital punishment for three discredited members of a badly tarnished institution could be more popular than any leniency advocated by the Liberal side of the Senate.
But these are risky times for Harper. He has clearly laid down the law on firing offences. He has issued orders to the Senate he expects to be obeyed.
If those laws and orders aren't followed, he could yet be a victim of his decree that political expediency trumps natural justice.
That's the Last Word.
Borscht is a super wholesome soup with modest origins in Eastern Europe where it is often prepared as a hearty warm soup in the winter or simply as a cooled thin broth to drink in the summer.
This soup is claimed by so many ethnic groups, especially Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews, as their own national or ethnic dish. None of such claims can be proven invalid, as the dishes history actually predates the emergence in Eastern Europe's modern nation states with their ever-shifting border.
Let's just agree that Borscht is perfectly suited to a globalist culture, a cuisine with variants so numerous with varieties so diverse that it is sometimes impossible for a non-specialist to grasp that any single example of this dish is something that is part of a unified tradition. In the spirit of this idea, we at Wholesome Linen present to you a recipe so simple that even a baby would remember the taste for the rest of their life. We wanted to get started by explaining how each separate ingredient possesses its own benefit, especially in the early development of your baby's digestive palette.
Important health benefits of the borscht ingredients
Potatoes: While white potatoes have respectable amounts of vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as potassium, their starch component is high.It would be best to keep white potatoes out of baby's diet until between 8-10 months of age.
Onion Bulb: Packed with vitamin C, onions can help boost the immune system and offer protection against bacterial infection. Eating onions can boost your baby's iron absorption from other foods.This means that your baby may absorb more iron and zinc from foods like rice and chickpeas if you add onions and garlic as you cook them.Small amount of cooked onion can be mixed with foods your baby is already enjoying once they are comfortably digesting first solid foods which happens normally after 8 months of age.
Carrots: One of baby's first food. They are easy to digest and are packed full of nutrients such as vitamin C and Calcium and vitamin A. vitamin A is very important in a developing infant's diet. Recommendation for introducing carrots is between 7 and 8 months old.
Cabbage: People call cabbage ‘superfood', and for a very good reason! Sulfur rich foods like Cabbage ‘feed' the good bacteria in the gut and make digestion easy. You can give your baby cabbage after 8 months.
Beetroot: Some of the health benefits for babies include the following; cure for anemia; improved digestion; liver protection; anti-oxidant and increased brain activity and development. You may introduce beetroot in quantities of not more than 1-2 teaspoons into your homemade baby food when your baby is at least 8-10 months.
Lemon: The health benefits of lemons can act as a remedy for digestive issues, cure for diarrhea issues and as a remedy for most oral diseases, strengthening the immune system, fighting against cold and also prevents cholera. You can give diluted lemon juice after six months of age.
Tomatoes: Fantastic sources of vitamin A and vitamin C. Exercise a bit of caution when offering these tasty little foods to you baby as the acidity of tomatoes may not agree with baby's tummy, for these reason tomatoes are typically not recommended to be introduced to an infant until somewhere between 10 and 12 months of age.
Salt: Babies should not have more than a small amount of salt: less than 1g (0.4g sodium) a day until they are 12 months. Your baby's kidneys can't cope with more salt than this.
Bay Leaf: Some of the most impressive health benefits of bay leaves include their ability to improve digestion, speed up healing wounds, protect the body from bacterial infections, reduce inflammation and alleviate respiratory issues. You can use bay leaf in soups and broths for babies from 8-10 Months.
Dill: may help protect against cancer and has anti-bacterial properties, which means it helps to protect your baby against any kind of infections. It's also a good source of calcium, plus it contains important minerals like iron, manganese and magnesium. Dill tea is often given to babies for gripe or gas pains. Many pediatricians advise waiting until Baby is seven or eight months old to try different spices

MILWAUKEE -- A partnership between several Milwaukee organizations is working to get at-risk adults valuable work experience while earning a GED -- and there's a big push to get the applications filled out.
It's called the 'YouthBuild' program which gives young adults 16 to 24-years-old, an education in construction trades experience that will give hard-to-employ residents a better shot at landing a full-time job.
Teams around the city hit the pavement on Saturday, October 31st to hand-deliver applications for the program.
"What we are going to be doing is offering a 15-week course at MATC, guaranteed to have a job when you finish the course," said Carolyn Anderson, Mrs. Milwaukee.
Who applies? The criteria are specific: current or former foster youth, someone with a criminal record, or has an incarcerated parent, individuals with a disability and others.
"It is particularly for carpentry and our organization provides the soft skills -- so how do you interview, how do you dress, how to answer the right questions," said Anderson.
The program is offered through a partnership between 'Life Transformation Center,' and the Milwaukee Area Technical College.
"Everyone has to be a voice for this because it is a good effort and we need to turn it from an effort to progress," said Mario Dickens, pastor.
Alderman Joe Davis says programs like this have an incredible return for communities.
"Once we start one by one and we bring folks into the workforce, men can be better fathers and women can be better mothers," said Davis.
Several hundred applications were handed out but if you know somebody who may qualify, there are still plenty of applications left . They hope to have roughly 3,000 people in the program.

MIND MOVES:‘How do I let go of my anger?' a stranger asked, recalls TONY BATES
A CURIOUS thing happened to me on the Luas recently. I had been standing since boarding the tram at Heuston, but when we reached the Jervis Street stop, a seat freed up. I sat down, grateful for the rest. I was happily window gazing, when I heard a loud voice from somewhere behind me asking for “a two euro piece”. I noticed a look of disgust on the face of a woman in a nearby seat, so I turned to see what was up.
A young man with Down syndrome was making his way through the packed carriage. His beautiful open face looked distressed. He persisted in asking everyone around him for two euro, mumbling that he needed it for the bus home. I dug a coin from my coat pocket, reached back and handed it to him. Job done; back to gazing out the window.
A moment or two later, this same young man sat down in the seat beside me and put his head in his hands. Apropos of nothing at all, he blurted: “How do you stop feelin' annoyed with someone?” This guy clearly preferred to skip small talk.
I asked him what had him so annoyed, but he wasn't happy to talk about it. “Just someone who did something a month ago that made me mad.” And then he repeated his question to me with an even greater sense of urgency: “How do you stop feeling mad at someone?”
I asked him what it's like to walk around holding onto anger. He remained bent over, head in hands, distressed by a feeling that wouldn't leave. And he said: “It hurts.”
We had an audience who were monitoring our conversation with interest. Maybe this boy wasn't alone in walking around with unresolved anger. Maybe these onlookers were asking themselves the same question: “How do I let go of my anger?”
I wasn't sure at all what to say to this young man, but he was growing on me by the minute. I offered him a lame cliché – “Maybe you need to forgive him” – but he saw through this immediately. “No,” he said. “Tried that, didn't work.” That put me in my place.
I remembered something about people with Down syndrome: they are more connected to their heart than most of us. So I took a different tack and suggested: “Maybe you need to love him.” For the first time since he had sat down he lifted his head from his hands, sat up, and smiled. “Ah love,” he proclaimed loudly. “It's what bonds us all.” And he threw his arms out in front of him.
He introduced himself to me and shook my hand. The woman who had been turning her eyes to heaven only moments before, leaned over and kindly offered him her best advice: “You need to pray for him too.” Another woman sitting behind her added: “You know, no matter how bad things might be for you, there is always someone else who feels even worse.”
The thought briefly crossed my mind that this second woman – whose face revealed her to be no stranger to pain – had probably tried to console herself with this truth many times.
My new friend responded warmly to each of them, thanked them and shook their hands. The tense atmosphere that had hung in the air vanished. There we now were, all of us, no longer strangers, crowded together at the door waiting to disembark, joking about keeping our balance as the tram curved around Busáras.
In the space of four Luas stops, something had shifted for each of us. We had been wary strangers at Jervis, but smiling friends when we reached Connolly. What had made the difference? Was it the inspired advice that we had given this young man? I suspect not.
I think it was more what he had done for us. His lack of pretence, his direct openness, had disarmed us. He had allowed us for a moment to step out from behind our separate selves and experience a simple but powerful connection with one another.
It occurred to me that this young man with his so-called disability, who made a carriage cringe, was freer and probably healthier than most of us that day. While we lived mostly in our heads, our hearts hidden behind a fear of disapproval, this young man lived from his heart. And even when it hurt, he didn't try to hide it.

For the love of all that is holy Blizzard, rework this card.
Let's assume for a moment that a card existed in Hearthstone that read “2 manas: 90% chance win the game, 10% chance do nothing”. I think we'd unanimously agree that such a card would be overpowered. Now imagine a card that said “1% chance win the game, 99% chance do nothing”. We can agree that such a card would suck. That means that somewhere between 1% and 90% we have a balanced card. I think that number is somewhere around 15%. Unstable portal has about an 85% chance to hit a minion that costs 2 or more. 70% for 3 or more. In the event that you play unstable portal on turn two and get a minion costing 6+ (about a 20% chance), you will probably win the game on the spot. All you invested was one card and your second turn to have a boulderfist ogre in play on turn 3.
Will you get Grimscale oracle sometimes? Sure, but even in that scenario all you did was play a 2 mana 1/1. The vast majority of the time you'll be breaking even or netting a huge tempo swing akin to Innervate or Wild Growth. Is it worse off the top of the deck later in the game? Sure, but still much better than Wild Growth would have been and still capable of rolling a 6 mana Onyxia. Unstable Portal will warp half of the games it's played in around itself, and the extremely high chance for a free win makes it an auto-include in any mage deck. Hold on to your extra Portals so you can disenchant them for full dust once to nerf bat strikes. However, of all the cards on this list, Unstable Portal is the one I'm the least sure about. The variance involved may very well make it unplayable. Only one way to find out, get out there and play!
BARCELONA—Lifeless, tinny sound is the norm for most mobile devices, but Lenovo's bucking that trend with its new Tab 2 A8 (starting at $130) and Tab 2 A10-70 (starting at $200). Announced Sunday at Mobile World Congress, both Android tablets will feature Dolby Atmos 3D sound technology. I can't embed a sound bite, so you'll have to believe me: This is truly impressive sound quality for the price.
We listened to the Tab 2 A8's Dolby Atmos sound using headphones (the built-in speakers are nothing special). The Atmos technology makes you think you're hearing sounds coming not just from left and right, but also above, behind, ahead…it's a distinctly better audio experience.
I didn't need headphones to appreciate what the Tab 2 A10-70 could achieve, with Dolby Atmos and the wide sound bar built into the bottom of one side. You're not going to mistake it for a nice stereo system, but you're also not going to wince. The same immersive audio experience emanated from that sound bar.
Image: Melissa Riofrio The Lenovo Tab 2 A10-70 will ship in April with Android 4.4 KitKat and be upgradable to Lollipop in June.
Both Tab 2 devices have other nice attributes. The A8's 8-inch IPS screen has a resolution of 1280x800 pixels. The A10-70's 10.1-inch display has a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels. The A8 also has dual SIM slots for GSM and 4G LTE, so you could conceivably use this as a crazy-large phablet. The LTE version of the A8 will cost $180. If you must be that person who uses your tablet as a camera, the A8 has front 2MP and rear 5MP models, while the A10-70 has 5MP front and 8MP rear. Both tablets use MediaTek quad-core processors.
Android Lollipop will come preinstalled on the A8 when it ships in June. The A10-70 ships in April with Android 4.4 KitKat and will be upgradable to Lollipop in June. The LTE version of the A10-70 will cost $280.
It's not hard to find an affordable Android tablet, but it is hard to find any tablet with decent sound. Lenovo's new Tab 2 tablets are reasonably priced and offer surprisingly good sound systems, and that should give them an edge in a crowded field.
Like many directors, Stanley Kubrick (known for such iconic films as The Shining, Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Full Metal Jacket) began his love of film for the medium's capacity to immediately capture scenes developing around him. The award-winning director's photographs show early promise, mastering stylistic elements such as composition, lighting, balance and subject, which might not be surprising. However, the young Kubrick's subject matter, mostly street-scenes with everyday New York and Greenwich Village people, life and struggles, might surprise some coming from the famed science fiction director. The photos, which have a nostalgic tone not necessarily associated with the forward-thinking director, certainly bring a romantic mood to the seemingly simpler time.
Many of these photos were taken during the 1940's, while Kubrick was employed as a photographer for Look Magazine (a gig he landed while still a student at City College New York). It was while working for Look that Kubrick began associating with the film programs at the Museum of Modern Art, a connection which eventually launched Kubrick into a career in his life-long interest of film.

Story highlights Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met privately here on Tuesday evening
At stake in the primary are 20 delegates
Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders met privately at the Capital Hilton in Washington on Tuesday evening, just after Clinton won the final contest on the Democratic calendar in the District of Columbia.
The meeting came as the Vermont senator has begun signaling that his campaign is soon to close, though Sanders' aides say he is not expected to immediately endorse Clinton. Clinton became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, but Sanders declined to drop out and pledged to give every voter a chance to decide between the two candidates.
"Sen. Sanders and Secretary Clinton met in Washington on Tuesday evening and had a positive discussion about how best to bring more people into the political process and about the dangerous threat that Donald Trump poses to our nation," said Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman, in a statement. "Sanders congratulated Secretary Clinton on the campaign she has run and said he appreciated her strong commitment to stopping Trump in the general election."
Clinton and Sanders were joined by her campaign manager Robby Mook and campaign chairman John Podesta, along with Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver and his wife, Jane. It lasted about 90 minutes.
The two were never alone in the room. Other lower level aides were in a nearby room and came in and out occasionally.

I've wanted to write this list for a long time and the upcoming release of Marvel's The Avengers has finally given me the motivation to sit down and do it. This summer is going to change the historical landscape of the superhero film genre and it wouldn't surprise me if all three of the major blockbusters due out crack the top ten list. The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises, in particular, seem like near guaranteed hits due to their excellent histories and the talent behind the films. Before that potentially happens I wanted to reflect on the genre I love so much (you can read more on my love of the genre, and why it's important, by clicking here) and how far it's come. Since I'll likely look at this list differently after this summer I wanted to crystallize this moment in film history and give the current top ten their due.
10.) Superman: The Movie (1978)
Director: Richard Donner
Richard Donner basically created the blockbuster superhero genre with his iconic take on Superman. There are several movies in my “honorable mention” section that I enjoy more but Donner's flick makes the list on importance and based on the context in which it was created.
Christopher Reeves was the perfect casting and he stands as an icon because of this role. It also features a fun performance from Gene Hackman and a classic score. People call this the movie that made them believe a man could fly. That sort of fanciful notion is at the heart of why these movies are entertaining. They take us to the sorts of places we go when we dream.
9.) X2: X-Men United (2003)
Director: Bryan Singer
I really enjoy the X-Men films ,(they were my favorite characters as a kid) but upon rewatching recently I noticed that the first film is a little goofy. Bryan Singer's follow up loses a lot of that and the result is a darker, superior film. It also takes the established origin and runs with it. The stakes feel more personal, yet higher, than the first film and it causes us to care deeply about the characters.
The casting is pretty strong across the board but the three standouts are Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Jackman is an uncannily (nerd pun intended) good Wolverine and he managed to take on a fan favorite and make it work. Stewart and McKellen are both necessary to pull off the staggering characters that are Professor X and Magneto. Fans of the comics/cartoon show know that these two have Shakespearean gravitas and one of the best relationships in all fiction. It is fitting that two thespians occupy these key roles.
8.) Batman Returns (1992)
Director: Tim Burton
This is another case of a sequel adopting a much darker tone than its predecessor and being better off for it. Jack Nicholson's Joker was fun but his menace is limited by his humor. Batman Return features a truly twisted take on the Penguin (a marvelously cast Danny DeVito) and a sexy iconic portrayal of Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). The franchise went downhill after this movie and it seems all the better when compared to the two films that came after it.
7.) Captain America: The First Avenger
Director: Joe Johnston
Despite a surprisingly unmemorable villain Joe Johnston captures the perfect old school tone and the film really benefitted from some fantastic structuring. It is a large sweeping origin story that manages to be funny and exciting in the mold of the best adventure films. I loved how they paid homage to Cap's comic costume and also created a kick ass “real” costume. The montage of his patriotic “performances” stands as one of the best sequences in any Marvel film and the movie's ability to covertly expand the Avengers universe was impressive (as opposed to, say Iron Man 2's lack of subtlety). Captain America is an all around good time in a way that many superhero films can only dream of. Read a full review here.
6.) Spider-Man (2002)
Director: Sam Raimi
This and 2000's X-Men launched superheroes (and hyphens) back into prominence after Batman & Robin attempted to brutally murder the genre. Earlier I noted the X-Men felt a little goofy and the same can technically be said for Spider-Man. The difference is that Sam Raimi managed to translate the tone of the comics onto screen and make the goofiness work in his favor. Tobey Maguire was an inspired choice for Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe is clearly having a ton of fun chewing scenery as Green Goblin. This movie also contains the greatest comic book movie casting ever. J. Jonah Jameson, as played by J.K. Simmons, is pitch perfect. Anyone who grew up with these characters can attest that it feels like he was ripped from the page (or in my case the animated series) and put on screen.
Most importantly this felt like the definitive tale of the character. From the famous upside down kiss to Willem Dafoe arguing with himself, this movie was deeply memorable and captured the essence of Peter Parker's story.
5.) Hellboy & Hellboy 2: The Golden Army (2004, 2008)
Director: Guillermo Del Toro
Okay, I cheated on this one. I couldn't pick between the two films because they're both so excellent. The first one is a great introduction to a little known character and it strikes the perfect tone. The sequel feels like the studio told Del Toro to do whatever the hell he wanted and the result is a quirkier film with awesome visuals and creature designs, but a lot of the solid chemistry that made the first one a success. Hellboy's isolation from the world is powerfully conveyed and Ron Pearlman owns the role in through a combination of talent and tremendous makeup/costume work. He could have looked goofy but turned out perfectly. Great films that really stand as some of the most unique superhero films of the current genre boom.
4.) Iron Man (Iron Man)
Director: Jon Favreau
I think “I am Iron Man” stands as one of my favorite ending moments of a film and that “fuck it” attitude is at the heart of what made this movie rock. Iron Man might have genre tropes but it is a testament to how diverse superhero films have started to become. Films like Hellboy, Iron Man, The Dark Knight and Kickass all speak to the sort of variety that now exists.
For all the raving I've done over good casting (this is the key to most films but especially for superheroes) I still need to go a step further when praising the choice of RDJ. He is Tony Stark. He brings so much humor to the movie while simultaneously getting us invested in Tony's redemption.
3.) X-Men: First Class
Director: Matthew Vaughn
After the bad third X-Men film and worse Wolverine movie it seemed that a once enjoyable franchise had gone the way of the Fantastic Four. Then Matthew Vaughn came along with this period piece about the formation of the titular hero group and shot new life into the property. There's a lot to like here, from the excellently realize period setting (and the way world history plays into the plot) to the effective ensemble and engrossing story, but this film works because of Vaughn's perfect handling of Professor X and Magneto. James McAvoy is charming and clever in the role of young Xavier and Michael Fassbender steals the entire movie with his powerful, haunted and deeply badass take on Magneto. Magneto's journey to villainy is affecting and believable and that is a real triumph of superhero storytelling.
2.) Spider-Man 2
Director: Sam Raimi
Freed from the origin story, Raimi's sequel really embraces a full on Spider-Man adventure. Where the first film felt like the definitive start of Spider-Man this one felt like a great chapter in his ongoing adventures. Some critics found Doc Oc to feel like a “villain of the week” but he works as a physical threat and he's well written (and acted) enough to make up for it. It also fit into the tone of Raimi's world because these movies never seemed committed to one grand story, but rather installments more in the spirit of comics.
Beyond that the story is excellent because it deals with Peter battling with the “great responsibility” established in the first film. Having his powers disappear while he is struggling with Makes Peter as interesting as Spider-Man.
1.) The Dark Knight
Director: Christopher Nolan
And now we come to the granddaddy of them all. The Dark Knight redefined what superhero films could be by embracing gritty realism and artistic gravitas. Nolan crafted an all-time great crime drama that happened to feature Batman and co. No every superhero film should establish such a heavy tone but Batman seems tailor made for serious thematic exploration, practicality and a nuanced gaggle of villains. This is one of those movies that wholly earns the label of “epic”. Aaron Eckhart delivered an unexpected (and underrated) take on Two-Face that really added a dynamic of ideological struggle to the film. Nolan isn't just interested in the actions these people take but what those actions represent and his variety of clashing characters play this out on a grand, fantasy stage.
The movie will always be remembered for Heath Ledger's transformative (and deservedly legendary) take on The Joker but it was more important than just the Oscar winning performance. This is the movie that started to convince doubters that these films could be truly great works of storytelling capable of attracting intelligent writers and directors who see the genre as a sort of modern day myth making. The Greeks had Olympus. We have Gotham. Personally, I think we got the better end of that deal.
Honorable Mention: Blade, Unbreakable, Batman, X-Men, Batman Begins, Kickass, Thor
Movie That Isn't In The Spirit Of The List But Totally Needs to Get Mentioned because It is Tremendous and Better Than Several Movies on the List: The Incredibles

Food producers, retailers, and restaurants are using data analytics to better understand customer needs and uncover important food industry market trends.
The food industry is one of the world's largest and most important business sectors. The field encompasses everything from producers and shipping companies to retailers and restaurants.
Food is nothing less than an essential part of life and a major global economic force. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for the food industry to follow the path already taken by many financial and marketing firms and use sophisticated analytics tools and methods to better understand consumers and uncover emerging market trends.
Big data-driven analytics supports food industry businesses with critical decision-making capabilities in the areas of pricing, product promotion, product development, and demand forecasting. Benefits include improved product innovation, greater sales effectiveness, enhanced margins and profitability levels, extended customer reach, increased marketing ROI, and greater customer satisfaction and loyalty.
"To stay competitive in the industry, food and beverage companies should highly consider implementing data analytics tools," says Lori Mitchell-Keller, global general manager of consumer industries for analytics technology provider SAP. "Companies that have unbiased, analytical insight into their consumers and overall operations will have a serious advantage over their competitors."
Data mining farm-fresh insights
Oberweis Dairy, headquartered in North Aurora, Ill., operates a chain of dairy-related shops and restaurants, a direct-to-home delivery service, and a wholesale dairy business in the Midwestern U.S. Like a growing number of food industry businesses, Oberweis decided several years ago that it needed to get inside customers' minds in order to fully understand their needs and preferences. "Our primary goal for analyzing data is to understand our customers better," says Bruce Bedford, the company's vice president of marketing analytics and consumer insights. "We want to identify our best customers for cross-selling and up-selling purposes, and identify those customers who are at risk for leaving so we can intervene."
Using SAS analytics tools, Oberweis gathers data from numerous sources, including store point-of-sale transactions and delivery service records, as well as data generated by its wholesale shipments to neighborhood grocery stores. The company also taps into third-party datasets to understand evolving situations and events that could potentially hinder deliveries or store traffic. "For example, weather data comes to us through a web interface supported by the Midwestern Regional Climate Center," Bedford says. Additionally, a significant amount of potentially useful data is still entered manually into spreadsheets by staff located throughout the company. "SAS helps us read data from all of these sources, regardless of how it is entered, and process it into common, consistent, and structured formats that can be used for reporting and analyses of all types," he notes.
Denmark's largest grocer transformed an IT bottleneck into an engine of in-store retail analytics and business agility, resulting in increased revenues and reduced waste. Read how
Bedford views analytics as an essential business technology. "Whether you're selling wholesale or serving customers in a retail model, the strategic use of analytics is essential for any food business that wants continued success in this competitive industry," he says.
A growing number of restaurant operators have realized that analytics is critical to success in competitive markets. Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Bahama Breeze, and several other restaurant brands, relies on analytics to detect fraud, optimize menu prices, and study the length of customer visits. The Cheesecake Factory has relied on analytics for several years to develop customer-pleasing dishes and ensure a better overall customer experience. In the fast-food sector, Subway is one of several players that use analytics to study daily operations, spot opportunities for improved efficiency, and increase revenue.
Bedford notes that the recent Amazon-Whole Foods Market merger is spurring an even deeper interest in analytics among food industry players. "What they're going to offer consumers ratchets up the stakes for everybody in the food business," he says. "Becoming a data-driven culture that values the insights analytics can reveal is key for remaining relevant in this landscape."
Big data in the food industry
Among major U.S. food retailers, Cincinnati-based supermarket giant Kroger was an early and enthusiastic analytics adopter. The company now has its own in-house data analytics firm in the form of a wholly owned subsidiary, 84.51°, which it uses to gain deep insight into customer preferences and ordering patterns. Last year, 84.51° expanded its capabilities by acquiring Market6, a predictive analytics specialist. “Every decision we make focuses on engaging customers where, when, and how it matters most to them,” CEO Stuart Aitken said in a statement at the time of the Market6 acquisition.
A key way Kroger uses analytics to drive sales is by generating personalized offers and tailored pricing to customers through its MyMagazine direct marketing initiative. Leveraging analytics from 84.51°, Kroger was able to deliver in the first quarter of 2017 more than 6 million unique and customized offers to It's Plus Card members through MyMagazine. “Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization,” observed Rodney McMullen, Kroger's chairman and CEO, during the company's 2017 second-quarter earnings call. "We have a history of evolving to meet our customers' ever-changing needs. The key is to proactively see where the customer is going and to proactively address the changes."
In Denmark, Dansk Supermarked Group (DSG) is using analytics to match its inventory needs to customer preferences, ensuring that it never misses a sale yet never overstocks items, a practice that leads to waste and needless costs. Shoppers benefit by always having access to a wide selection of fresh food products.
A mass-market retailer that serves up to 1.4 million store customers a day, DSG uses SAP HANA analytics technology to predict the types of food consumers will purchase by analyzing recent sales data trends. The approach generates accurate and timely insights into each store's overall shopping history.
DSG's systems continuously inhale massive amounts of transactional data generated by point-of-sale systems located in stores scattered across Europe. The information is rapidly analyzed to deliver information-rich, actionable reports to key decision-makers throughout the company. Store managers, from the moment they arrive in the morning, can view in detail exactly what customers purchased the day before. That helps the company make the best possible inventory stocking decisions. At the top executive level, DSG has the insights it needs to plan for future growth, including opening additional stores, introducing a new convenience-store format, and pursuing promising e-commerce opportunities.
Viewing the big picture
Data analytics offers another important benefit: the ability to reveal clues to larger and potentially significant market trends. The recent spike in avocado prices provides a prime example of how analytics can help retailers and restaurants manage costs, says Nic Smith, SAP's global vice president of product marketing for cloud analytics. Over the past few years, the U.S. consumption of avocados has significantly spiked. Meanwhile, retailers and restaurants have seen avocado prices more than double over the past 12 months. "With the ability to review recent purchase history and consumer sentiment, businesses can predict consumer demands well in advance," Smith says.
Smith notes that as soon as consumers began purchasing avocados in much larger quantities, restaurants with access to that data should have incorporated more avocado-based options on their menus. "Grocers should have stocked up and provided a range based on price and variety, and producers should have invested in methods to ensure a constant flow of fresh, ripe avocados year-round," Smith says. "By interpreting this trend with analytics, restaurants, grocers, and retailers could have experienced a significant boom in business, without the stress of not being prepared for the increased demand for avocados."
A priceless tool: Vision
Bedford notes that analytics gives food industry businesses a priceless tool: vision. "By analyzing data, you're in a much better position to make sound predictions about customer preferences and behavior," he says. "If you can tap into customer sentiment and offer products and services before they even realize they need or want it, you're as close to bulletproof as any company can be."
Smith agrees. "Soon, all successful businesses will rely on analytics to inform company decisions around production, sales, and marketing," he says. "While larger companies were the first to invest in the technology, smaller food companies are now following suit, as they see the value of having access to data analytics at a moment's notice."
Big data in the food industry: Lessons for leaders
Use data analytics tools to understand customer preferences in order to stock or serve the right products at the right time.
Carefully analyze collected data to uncover and address trends that may soon help or hurt the business.
Look for and evaluate promising new data analytics technologies and methods to keep pace with competitors and customer demands.
Allow managers to access data and make fast and decisive changes based on the insights they receive.

An Antifa organization called Redneck Revolt is advocating for “revolution” against the rise of “fascism” in the United States, and the end of capitalism. To facilitate these goals, the group offers a variety of resources, including a training manual for conducting guerrilla warfare with sections for “executions” and “terrorism.” In the wake of the targeted shooting of Republican members of Congress earlier this year, nothing is more concerning than extremist organizations calling for armed revolts against civil society.
Redneck Revolt is one of several organizations to spring up following Trump's victory at the 2016 polls, and is purportedly one of the largest of these Antifa organizations currently operating in the United States with over 30 chapters across 20 states.
It describes itself as a group made up of “working class and poor people” with declarations of taking “meaningful action” against “our common enemy: the rich.” It lists “militant resistance” as one of the group's guiding principles.
Antifa members have been labeled “anarchist extremists” and listed among “domestic terrorism” groups by the Office of Homeland Security in New Jersey. Daily Caller deputy editor Scott Greer compared antifascist groups to terrorists in a Fox News appearance.
Much of the group's official website includes rhetoric pulled straight out of Marxist publications, echoing various talking points often spouted by leftists about the evils of capitalism, property ownership, “artificial borders,” and basic systems of social order, including police, prisons, and courts.
Redneck Revolt refers to these public institutions as “systems of social control [that] only exist to serve the rich,” and calls for the end of the “nation-state project.” It lists the US Armed Forces alongside the Ku Klux Klan as having “undermined the struggle for freedom among all people.”
The “Resources” page of the group's website offers a number of publications that promote violence, including a 36-page manual called the “Mini-Manual of the Urban Guerrilla,” which advises readers on how to conduct urban warfare, with sections on “sabotage,” “kidnapping,” “executions,” and even “terrorism.”
Other publications include “Piece Now, Peace Later: an anarchist introduction to firearms”—a how-to guide for weapons handling—and a variety of intersectional feminist and anarchist essays.
“Redneck Revolt” is more than just a website or a call to action. VICE News did a short documentary on a chapter of the armed group when they marched through Asheboro, North Carolina to protest a scheduled rally by the Ku Klux Klan. In the documentary, they yelled chants against both the police and the KKK, to the ire of residents who support the authorities.
“Racist. Sexist. Filled with hate. America was never great,” chanted members of the group in the filmed protest.
“Redneck Revolt” has gone beyond simply protesting far-right extremist groups, organizing armed rallies alongside other Antifa groups at the Arizona State Capitol to counter a Trump rally. The group reprinted its report, “It's Going Down,” which received funding through Patreon until its account was suspended last week for Terms of Service violations.
Interviewed by The Guardian, members of the leftist organization declared their opposition not only to the far-right, but to liberals in general. Mother Jones praised the group for its pledge to “resist right-wing extremists by any means necessary.” Little mention was made of the group's plans to conduct armed warfare in either interview, however—depicting them instead as white working-class individuals who care about social justice.
Emboldened by progressive rhetoric in the media, Redneck Revolt's call for violent action against “fascists” may eventually reach a crisis that'll result in more than sore jaws and hurt feelings.
Redneck Revolt did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication.

Jonah Krochmalnek is a 26-year-old farmer. He pulls up to work every day ready to plant, tend and harvest a variety of organic greens and herbs. He produces loads, too. In a given year — he doesn't have to worry about seasons on his farm — Krochmalnek estimates he could grow 16,000 kilograms of pea shoots, if they were his only crop.
Vertical farms just might be the future of agriculture and Torontonian Jonah Krochmalnek is forging a strong client base for his farm growing right in the heart of the city.
Living Earth Farms, the company Krochmalnek started four years ago is no ordinary farm. That's because it isn't on a remote country road where plants have space to stretch out and soak up sunlight, but in an unassuming, 2,300-square-foot industrial unit in North York, the same area where Krochmalnek grew up and lives still. Living Earth is an indoor, vertical farm where crops grow in stacked rows seven layers high with special red and blue LED lights designed for optimal growing conditions shining down on them. It's the first of its kind to be organic certified in Ontario.

“It took a long time to figure all this out because there's no book on this type of thing,” Krochmalnek said. His farm is closed to the public because Krochmalnek works there alone and doesn't have the means to run an educational component yet. Indoor farming is a new industry, especially in Canada where Krochmalnek runs one of the first such businesses to get off the ground. He sells wholesale to distributors all year — a pot of living basil goes for $2.40 ($4-$5 retail) and a 100-gram clamshell of a variety of microgreens sells for $10 (restaurants buy them for around $15). Since he grows indoors, he has to automate as much of the growing process as possible, and ensure that it's efficient enough to make money. In fact, most of what makes up Living Earth Farms was put together by Krochmalnek himself, from the giant fans that control humidity, to the sub-irrigation system that keeps plants watered without risking contamination.

His choice of red and blue LED lights was informed by NASA research aimed at figuring out how to grow food in space. “This is probably somewhat of a model that will be used if we go to Mars,” he said. Since the lights he uses are energy efficient, his hydro bill has never exceeded $1,600 (usually it's closer to $1,000-$1,200).

By growing indoors, Krochmalnek is able to produce food year-round. It's kind of like having a greenhouse — only it requires a seventh of the space to produce the same yield and uses about 95 per cent less water than traditional farms for crops like lettuce. “In the winter something like basil takes me 16 days to grow. In a greenhouse, almost double that,” Krochmalnek said. The quality, he said, is “not even close.” “My basil tastes like summer. Basil in the winter grown in a greenhouse tastes like water.” The reason for the difference is simply that the space Krochmalnek has designed is ripe for growing. It's, as Krochmalnek describes it, the “perfect plant environment.” “Let's say you want to be in a tropical sunny place to go on vacation generally. This is like plant vacation. The plants have it easy here,” he said. Well before he ever imagined making a living by designing and operating a plant paradise (he studied business, not agriculture), Krochmalnek cherished a love of gardening. His dad showed him how to keep a garden at age 14 and he was instantly hooked. “Whenever I had a summer job I would bring my cherry tomatoes to people at the office, and their face would light up, and that's the best feeling,” he said. Krochmalnek began to see agriculture as a career possibility only after he took part in Downsview Park's urban farming initiative, Fresh City Farms, and loved it. He chose indoor farming in an attempt to make farming within the city viable, and now he can't imagine doing anything else. “It's 100 per cent certain that this will be part of the future. It won't be the whole future for agriculture, but it'll be a big part for leafy greens and perishable crops,” he said. Rhonda Teitel-Payne, co-coordinator of Toronto Urban Growers, said that, while urban farms like Krochmalnek's are unlikely to be sufficient to feed cities, they play an important role in food security, and connecting people to the food system. “We are going to see more and more farmers, more rooftop growers, more vertical systems because people are running out of options in terms of access to land,” she said. Though land is scarce, interest is growing. Vertical farming is “very new but there are a lot of people who are thinking about it, talking about it,” Teitel-Payne said. Looking forward, Krochmalnek has imminent plans to hire his first employee, and longer-term ideas about possible expansion. In the meantime, he hasn't stopped gardening for joy, in addition to business. Three potted eucalyptus plants sat under his LED lights last month, not for selling “just for fun.” Krochmalnek marvelled at the genetic differences that caused them to come out looking like a motley trio. “These are all from the same batch of seeds,” he said. “And they all grew differently.”

A large explosion was heard across the Egyptian capital on Saturday with witnesses reporting major destruction to the building
Bomb outside Italian embassy in Cairo leaves at least one dead
A huge explosion occurred in front of the Italian consulate in central Cairo on Saturday, killing at least one person, state news agency MENA said.
The cause of the blast was not immediately clear but one security official said it was a car bomb. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
A senior security source as saying preliminary investigations indicated that attackers had placed a bomb underneath a car near the consulate and remotely detonated it, MENA reported.
Heath ministry official Hossam Abdel-Ghaffar told Associated Press that at least one person was killed in the blast and MENA reported two police officers had been injured.
Islamist militants seeking to topple the government have claimed responsibility for roadside bombs and suicide bombing attacks.
The violence, and political turmoil triggered by the 2011 uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, have hurt Egypt's tourism industry, a pillar of the economy.
The explosion struck one of the busiest intersections in Cairo, a major artery that connects Ramses square to the heart of downtown Cairo.
The MENA report cited witnesses as saying the explosion had caused massive destruction to the building. The force of the blast shook a building in downtown Cairo and could be heard in many neighbourhoods.
Attacks on Egyptian checkpoints signal escalation in Isis capabilities Read more
A western diplomat said he was aware of the explosion in front of the consulate but could not confirm that the building was the target.
A Sinai-based insurgency has escalated since the army ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi after mass protests against his rule in 2013.
Two weeks ago, a car bomb killed the country's top public prosecutor and militants affiliated to Islamic State attacked several military checkpoints in North Sinai, in what was the fiercest fighting in the region in years.
The army said 17 soldiers and more than 100 militants were killed in those clashes.
The organization in charge of a national memorial to fallen officers will reconsider its decision to exclude slain Wauwatosa Police Officer Jennifer Sebena next week, according to an advocacy group.
A message on the Facebook page of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association says that the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund will meet April 3 to discuss the matter. Today's TMJ4 first reported the news Monday.
The organization declined to include Sebena because she was a victim of domestic violence; the result was a significant outcry from Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, the WPPA and and others.
Sebena was shot and killed while on duty Christmas Eve 2012. Her husband, Benjamin Sebena, has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the slaying. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect.
Every summer and fall, states bring out their best in fried food, portable attractions, and crowd-pleasing farm animals for annual state fairs. And while some fairs have gained fame for their size, others have gained followings with more under-the-radar attractions like giant vegetable contests, live cow birthings, and massive sculptures of chocolate and sand. If you're making a summertime tour of the U.S., or you happen to near live the location of a state fair, and, for some reason (are you crazy?!) need more motivation to attend, look no further than this list.
Below, we help you choose which fairs to visit this summer by breaking down the 10 best state fairs in the country. We made our selections using the only two criteria that truly matter when it comes to evaluating state fairs: the food (the fried-er the better) and the entertainment — concerts, competitions, and exhibitions — they offer. From New York's wino-friendly parade grounds and Minnesota's seemingly infinite tableau of foods on sticks, to Texas's thrill rides and Georgia's animal races, these are the food-coma-inducing, recipe-for-fun state fairs you have to go to this summer. Bring your antacids, because you're going to need them.
10. Arizona State Fair
If you're a fan of southwestern cuisine, do not miss the Arizona State Fair in Phoenix, (October 11—November 3). Chili, agua fresca, and husk-roasted sweet corn are just a few of the items repping the local palate. Grub options also include twists on fair classics, such as red velvet funnel cakes or maple bacon donuts. The fair is also great for animal lovers: Last year's fair included shows with goats, rabbits, cattle, and sheep.
9. Alaska State Fair
If you like produce and you like competition, the Alaska State Fair held annually in Palmer (August 21—September 1) may be, weirdly enough, for you. Due to Alaska's extended daylight in the summer months, plants and vegetables raised in the state can grow to monstrous sizes, and farmers bring their largest to the festival to compete for steep rewards. One such competition is the Giant Cabbage Weigh-Off, the winner of which receives $2,000. The record is currently held by Scott Robb Palmer, whose winning cabbage came in at 138.250 pounds.
8. North Carolina State Fair

State fairs and shopping don't often go together, but at the North Carolina State Fair in Raleigh (October 16—26), attendees can take advantage of both typical fair attractions — racing pigs, acrobats, and pumpkin carving demonstrations — and the famous Raleigh Flea Market. Open at the fairgrounds every weekend all year long (besides during the state fair), the market houses more than 600 vendors who sell clothing, jewelry, crafts, furniture, antiques, and other goods.
7. California State Fair
As with all its endeavors, the state of California brings big entertainment value and a touch of the exotic to its annual state fair. In previous years, more than 700,000 have flocked to Sacramento to experience water rides at Raging Waters park, an array of award-winning beers at Brewfest, and a Birds of Paradise exhibit. This year's fair will be held July 11—27.
6. Georgia State Fair

Monkeys riding dogs? In Georgia? This is what state fairs are all about. At the annual Georgia State Fair in Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia (this year, September 26—October 5), you can see the monkeys-on-dogs race (it's officially called the Banana Derby) and much more, including a live sea lion exhibit and a Halloween Magic Show. And when it comes to food, you better believe the southern state brings fried cuisine to a whole new level.
5. Ohio State Fair
The Ohio State Fair, which takes place in Columbus (July 23—August 3), is something of an outsized sculpture garden show: Attractions include a 500-pound chocolate sculpture, a 25-ton sand sculpture, and a ride called the SkyGlider, “one of the world's longest portable sky rides.” If you're more interested in the food, you'll be happy to know the fair has its own Food Finder App, which helps attendees locate everything from sausage sandwiches to deep-fried PB&J sandwiches.
4. Iowa State Fair

Iowa's 11-day State Fair in Des Moines (August 7—17) features almost 200 concession stands that serve a vast array of food, including 70 types of treats on a stick. And while attendees will find the usual decadent fare, healthy eaters also have options, including a whole salad on a skewer (um...). The fair also boasts a lineup worthy of a music festival. This year, the Goo Goo Dolls, the Plain White T's, Lady Antebellum, and Florida Georgia Line are all scheduled to make appearances.
3. New York State Fair
According to Country Living, the wine showing at the New York State Fair in Syracuse (August 21—September 1) beats even California's, as “dozens of wineries from across the state host tastings and vie for top-vitner status.” The best part about the fair's very own “Wine Village”? It's cheap — two dollars for a five-ounce glass — and you're allowed to walk around the fairgrounds with it. We recommend taking a glass (or six) to this year's concerts: Brad Paisley, Train, The Wallflowers, and Florida Georgia Line will all be playing. And if your taste for entertainment skews more bucolic, fret not: there will be a live cow birthing for attendees to watch.
2. State Fair of Texas

One needs to be careful at the State Fair of Texas: Take advantage of its famous fried food and its impressive thrill rides without a long enough break in between and things can get messy. On the food side of things, you can enjoy a fried Thanksgiving dinner, fried Nutella, fried pie, and other batter-bathed concoctions. On the ride side, be sure to get in line for the 1,800-foot-long gondola and the 212-foot Ferris Wheel (the Statue of Liberty, to compare, is 305 feet tall). Texas's world-famous fair is held annually in Dallas, and will run this year from September 26 to October 19.
1. Minnesota State Fair
The Minnesota State Fair the best fair in the country, and offers a number of compelling reasons why, not least of which is the fact that, in 2013, some 1.7 million people attended. What do they all come for? In addition to a range of farm-related attractions (Minnesota, like New York, has a live cow-birthing) the fair also includes a butter-sculpting contest, 70 types of food on a stick, deep-fried candy bars and — drum-roll, please — fairground-wide WiFi. It's not every fair that allows you to Instagram your fried-food adventures (or your selfie with Tim McGraw, who'll be performing). Check it all out for yourself at this year's in St. Paul, August 21—September 1.
In an interview, Dr. Goodwin said that Bill Lichtenstein, the program's producer, knew of his consulting but that neither thought “getting money from drug companies could be an issue.”
“In retrospect, that should have been disclosed,” he said.
But Mr. Lichtenstein said that he was unaware of Dr. Goodwin's financial ties to drugmakers and that, after an article in the online magazine Slate this year pointed out that guests on his program had undisclosed affiliations with drugmakers, he called Dr. Goodwin “and asked him point-blank if he was receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies, directly or indirectly, and the answer was, ‘No.' ”
Asked about the contradiction, Dr. Goodwin and Mr. Lichtenstein each stood by their versions of events.
“The fact that he was out on the stump for pharmaceutical companies was not something we were aware of,” Mr. Lichtenstein said in an interview. “It would have violated our agreements.”
Margaret Low Smith, vice president of National Public Radio, said NPR would remove “The Infinite Mind” from its satellite radio service next week, the earliest date possible. Ms. Smith said that had NPR been aware of Dr. Goodwin's financial interests, it would not have broadcast the program.
Sarah Alspach, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline, said, “We continue to believe that healthcare professionals are responsible for making disclosures to their employers and other entities, in this case National Public Radio and its listeners.”
“The Infinite Mind” has won more than 60 journalism awards over 10 years and bills itself as “public radio's most honored and listened to health and science program.” It has more than one million listeners in more than 300 radio markets. Mr. Lichtenstein said that the last original program was broadcast in October, that reruns have been running since and that “the show is going off the air.”

The program has received major underwriting from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, both of which have policies requiring grantees to disclose and manage conflicts of interest. Mr. Grassley wrote letters to both agencies asking whether disclosure rules were followed for the grants. Spokesmen for both agencies said they were cooperating with the investigation.

Mr. Grassley is systematically asking some of the nation's leading researchers and doctors to provide their conflict-of-interest disclosures, and he is comparing those documents with records of actual payments from drug companies. The records often conflict, sometimes starkly.
In October, Mr. Grassley revealed that Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff of Emory University, an influential psychiatric researcher, earned more than $2.8 million in consulting arrangements with drugmakers from 2000 to 2007, failed to report at least $1.2 million of that income to his university and violated federal research rules. As a result, the National Institutes of Health suspended a $9.3 million research grant to Emory, and Dr. Nemeroff gave up his chairmanship of Emory's psychiatry department.

In June, the senator revealed that Dr. Joseph Biederman of Harvard, whose work has fueled an explosion in the use of powerful antipsychotic medicines in children, had earned at least $1.6 million from drugmakers from 2000 to 2007, and failed to report most of this income to Harvard.
Mr. Grassley's investigation demonstrates how deeply pharmaceutical commercial interests reach into academic medicine, and it has shown that universities are all but incapable of policing these arrangements. As a result, almost every major medical school and medical society is reassessing its relationships with makers of drugs and devices.
“We know the drug companies are throwing huge amounts of money at medical researchers, and there's no clear-cut way to know how much and exactly where,” Mr. Grassley said. “Now it looks like the same thing is happening in journalism.”
Mr. Grassley has proposed legislation that would require drugmakers to disclose all payments of $500 or more to doctors. Eli Lilly and Merck have promised to begin doing so next year.
Dr. Goodwin has written an influential textbook on bipolar disorder and is an adjunct professor at George Washington University. In an interview, he blamed a changing ethical environment for any misunderstandings with Mr. Lichtenstein about his consulting arrangements. “More than 10 years ago, when he and I got involved in this effort, it didn't occur to me that my doing what every other expert in the field does might be considered a conflict of interest,” Dr. Goodwin said.
He defended the views he expressed in many of his radio programs and said that, because he consulted for so many drugmakers at once, he had no particular bias.

“These companies compete with each other and cancel each other out,” he said.
Industry critics dismiss that view, saying that experts who consult for drugmakers tend to minimize the value of nondrug or older drug treatments.
In the fine print of a study he wrote in 2003, Dr. Goodwin reported consulting or speaking for nine drugmakers, including Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis. Mr. Grassley asked for payment information only from GlaxoSmithKline. Dr. Goodwin said that in recent years, GlaxoSmithKline paid him more than other companies.
He said that he had never given marketing lectures for antidepressant medicines like Prozac, so he saw no conflict with a program he hosted in March titled “Prozac Nation: Revisited.” which he introduced by saying, “As you will hear today, there is no credible scientific evidence linking antidepressants to violence or to suicide.”
That same week, Dr. Goodwin earned around $20,000 from GlaxoSmithKline, which for years suppressed studies showing that its antidepressant, Paxil, increased suicidal behaviors.
Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, said that although concerns about news media bias were growing, few people believed that journalists took money from those they covered. Disclosures like those surrounding Dr. Goodwin could change that, “so this kind of thing is very damaging,” Mr. Rosenstiel said.
Central African Republic
African-Americans were thoroughly disappointed by the results of King Tut's DNA test which showed that Pharoah Tutankhamun and his father Akhenaten were at least of partial European ancestry.
In spite of the Great Black Disappointment of 2010, there are modern examples of legitimate African royalty whose existence is verifiable and indisputable.
In 1977, Jean-Bédel Bokassa was coronated His Imperial Majesty Emperor Bokassa the First of the Central African Empire in one the most ostentatious ceremonies in world history. The coronation of Bokassa was more lavish than anything to be found in the annals of Egyptian history and this more than makes up for the loss of King Tut to black people.
In a country with only 260 miles of paved roads and where 66 percent of the population lives on less than $1 a day, His Imperial Majesty's coronation cost $22 million dollars and one third of the Central African Republic's annual budget. 2,500 foreign dignitaries were invited to watch the two day event and feast on 220 tons of the world's finest cuisine.
Bokassa's golden eagle throne weighed two tons and was made of solid gold. His $750,000 crown was encrusted with 2,000 diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. 450 pounds of rose petals were strewn before the emperor and his empress. His entourage was escorted by dozens of earls, counts, dukes and lords in sixty Mercedes-Benz limousines named from among his personal friends.
As the “absolute monarch” of the Central African Republic, Bokassa forbade the use of the words “democracy” and “elections.” He promoted himself to the rank of general and then marshal and later “apostle.” In public appearances, Bokassa wore specially designed uniforms to accomodate all the medals and awards that he bestowed up himself.
He acquired four chateauxs in France, a fifty-room mansion in Paris, houses in Nice and Toulouse and a villa in Berne. He built a presidential palace in his “ancestral home” at Berengo and built a motorway there to access it with state funds. Political enemies were fed to lions and crocodiles at the Villa Kolongo.
Over the course of his 14 year reign, Bokossa announced a “Move to the East” and proclaimed “scientific socialism” to be the goal of his government, but when that didn't work out he converted to Islam and renamed himself “Salah Addin Ahmed Bokassa.” When he didn't receive enough money from the Arab world, he reverted to the Catholic Church and crowned himself emperor of the Central African Empire in emulation of Napoleon.
His Imperial Majesty Emperor Bokassa I sired 62 children by 17 official wives of all races. He maintained a harem of mistresses in separate villas paid for by taxpayers. Before his regime was toppled amid accusations of cannibalism by French troops in Operation Barracuda in 1979, Bokassa milked state coffers and extorted $10 million dollars into overseas bank accounts.
After 52 years of freedom and independence, life has gotten so bad in the Central African Republic that Bokassa's tyrannical reign is nostalgically remembered as a time of relative stability and prosperity.
Note: The first part of a 16 part documentary on the life of Emperor Bokassa I of the Central African Empire is found below. The other 15 parts are available on YouTube for those who are curious and want to learn more about one of the greatest black leaders of modern times.
The UEFA Executive Committee met today in Warsaw and issued the following statement:
Today's events are a disaster for FIFA and tarnish the image of football as a whole.
UEFA is deeply shocked and saddened by them.
These events show, once again, that corruption is deeply rooted in FIFA's culture.
There is a need for the whole of FIFA to be "rebooted" and for a real reform to be carried out.
The upcoming FIFA Congress risks to turn into a farce and therefore the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this Congress and caution a system, which, if it is not stopped, will ultimately kill football.
The UEFA member associations are meeting tomorrow ahead of the FIFA Congress. At that point, the European associations will decide on what further steps need to be taken to protect the game of football.
In the meantime, the members of the UEFA Executive Committee are convinced that there is a strong need for a change to the leadership of this FIFA and strongly believe that the FIFA Congress should be postponed, with new FIFA presidential elections to be organised within the next six months.
A bit of an oddball of a smartphone coming out of China answers a question we haven't heard asked. A company called Keyever has come up with a design for a smartphone with a bar form factor and a physical keyboard that runs Windows 10.
The display on the smartphone is a 3.5-inch AMOLED unit with qHD resolution (540x960px), complete with touch support too. The smartphone is said to be powered by one of Qualcomm's latest 600-series Snapdragons. A generous 3,000mAh battery should be plenty for that display and hardware.
Keyever Windows 10 bar phone
It's the keyboard that is the headline feature here, and it's also one where the engineers remain undecided, the source says. While the phone in the renders sports a numeric keypad, a full QWERTY option is being considered as well. The rear camera setup isn't final either, hence the pixelized back.
Keyever is shooting for a launch later this year, with Q3 being the target. Its intended price is said to be in the whereabouts of CNY 1000 ($155).

On the same day a new poll showed Colorado's U.S. Senate race between Democrat Mark Udall and Republican Cory Gardner virtually tied, a new candidate entered the race, saying neither party was capable of ending partisan bickering long enough to fix Washington.
Neurosurgeon Steve Shogan is a former Democrat who has been an unaffiliated voter since 2007.
“Congress is stuck in a hopeless logjam. Nothing will ever change in Washington until the political landscape changes,” he said. “I would ask, ‘What could possibly be more of a wasted vote than to continue to put the same failing parties back into office?' ”
Shogan has a long history of community service with influential Colorado groups, and his entry into the race has the potential to be a spoiler considering the two leading candidates are neck and neck.
Sen. Udall is leading Congressman Gardner 45 percent to 44 percent, but the senator's approval ratings have dropped and fewer voters think he should be re-elected, a Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows.
“I'm doing this not to be a spoiler but to win and change things in Washington,” Shogan said.
He kicked off his campaign at a hotel room in Glendale filled with family and friends, including medical staffers who dashed over in their hospital scrubs during their lunch hour.
Shogan later drove around the metro area in an ambulance he rented and covered with campaign signs to promote his candidacy.
“I think it's supposed to be symbolic of the fact that this country really in some ways requires emergency care. There are a number of problems we need to cure,” he said.
The partisan stalemate in Washington has led to sequesters, government shutdowns and the downgrading of America's credit, he said.
Asked by Quinnipiac the most important issue in deciding their U.S. Senate vote, Colorado voters listed the economy or jobs, 16 percent, and health care, 14 percent.
“No other issue comes close,” Quinnipiac reported.
The poll shows Udall leading 52 percent to 35 percent among women — the same audience he targeted when he released his first campaign ad this week. The spot blisters Gardner's position on abortion and birth control. Gardner leads 53 percent to 38 percent among men.
Colorado voters oppose the Affordable Care Act 59 percent to 37 percent, the poll found. Udall voted for the measure and has been hit with two ads — one unveiled Wednesday after the poll was conducted — from the conservative group Americans for Prosperity over his support for Obamacare.
Shogan believes Obamacare is a “fatally flawed program that won't accomplish its aims, will kill jobs and will add trillions to our debt.”
Since 1984, he has served as chief of neurosurgery at Rose Medical Center and as an assistant clinical professor at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, although he is putting his medical career on hold during the campaign.
“I'm a product of the '60s, and we really believed we were going to make a much better world of things. Unfortunately, we have not fulfilled on our promise to do that,” Shogan said. “Even though I've really gotten a lot of satisfaction out of being a physician, I would like to do something in a bigger way. I know that sounds kind of hokey, but that actually is the truth.”

Audi's Quattro division is planning a raft of new high-performance RS models, with some set to debut radical new powertrains, according to boss Heinz Peter Hollerweger—and the U.S. is being targeted as one of the main areas for growth of the RS brand.
“For us the next step is to establish the same enthusiasm for the cars in the United States and China,” Hollerweger told us during last week's press days for the Paris auto show. “We still have lots of work to do to establish the cars there the same way that we have in Europe.”
Although there's been lots of talk of diesel-powered RS models, and even the RS5 TDI concept that we drove earlier this year, Hollerweger insists that the creation of a diesel-powered RS model isn't a done deal and that even if it does happen, it's unlikely to cross the Atlantic. “That battle has not been won yet. It is one of the battles, but I have to say that it is mainly a European battle.”
When pushed, Hollerweger suggests that high-performance diesels might carry different branding from that of the full “RS” models, in the same way BMW has created the second-tier M Performance lineup that includes the M235i. “I'm not sure if you should weaken the strength of the RS brand with two different engines [in the same model]. But I could really imagine having some design elements and some performance elements of the RS with a diesel engine. Whether it's named RS or not I don't know; it's not decided.”

While volumes would be infinitesimal, offering Americans cars such as the mega-awesome RS6 Avant could provide Audi's Quattro division a huge boost both in enthusiast credibility and auto-journalist fawning.
When it comes to part-electric powertrains, Hollerweger becomes more positive. He took over Quattro in January when previous boss Franciscus van Meel left after rumors of a falling out with overall Audi R&D supremo Ulrich Hackenberg over electric powertrains. Van Meel has since moved to BMW to head up the M division, but there's no doubt that Hollerweger shares his boss's enthusiasm for electrification.
“For me there isn't necessarily a weight penalty—high-performance electric-driven cars or part-electric cars don't need to use a big battery at all. There's no engine that has better torque at zero revs than an electric [motor], and I believe you can adopt it into a high-performance car without carrying 250 kilograms [550 pounds] or even 150 kilograms [330 pounds] of batteries.”
Another interesting development that we're likely to see soon is the first generation of electric turbochargers, a technology that Audi has been discussing for several years. Hollerweger confirms that the arrival of 48-volt electrical systems in next-generation models opens the way for what should be lag-free turbocharging. We're also told that future RS models—and possibly even next year's new R8—will make use of active aerodynamic systems to improve efficiency and increase downforce.

In case you've ever wondered what an Audi RS7 would look like passing through that creepy tunnel from Willy Wonka.
Hollerweger confirmed that, despite the separate development of a 395-hp version of the EA888 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, there are no plans to switch smaller RS models away from the warbling turbocharged five-cylinder engine that currently propels them. He wouldn't talk specific power outputs of a revised five, which will be in the forthcoming RS3 and TT RS, but argued there are other reasons to favor it: “Let me say that [395 hp] is definitely not a limit for the five-cylinder engine, but I think its value is not only pure power. It's an exciting engine, the sound and the feel is unique, and it will have significantly more torque at low revs.”
And Quattro is also keeping faith with V-8 power, despite the increasingly tough requirements of CO2 emissions and fleet-average consumption. The next-generation R8, due next year, will continue to be offered with both V-8 and V-10 naturally aspirated power, while the mighty twin-turbocharged V-8 of the RS7 is likely to be developed further. “I think people with money still want to buy horsepower,” Hollerweger said, “but we have to deliver that alongside a lowering of CO2.”
The next-gen Audi R8 will be a Lambo Huracán that answers to another name. ( Read more here .)

There was also a broad, and welcome, hint that the next-generation RS5 coupe and cabrio (and their RS4 sedan sibling) will continue with V-8s, rather than follow BMW's trend of moving the M3 and M4 to sixes. “We are still developing V-8 engines, although application will depend on segment. There will still be cars in the C- and D-segment [Audi-speak for A6 and A8] with eight cylinders, and maybe also the B-segment [A4/A5]—look at Mercedes, they have introduced the [2015] C63 with an eight-cylinder.” This would be an odd thing to say if Quattro isn't planning a similarly happy future for the RS4 and RS5.
But downsizing is also likely to become more of a factor as we move into tougher emissions standards. Hollerweger admits that consideration is also being given to offering the new R8 with a turbocharged engine for markets where consumption and CO2 numbers have become critical: “Let me say we may have to split the segment a little bit. For the really high-power engine in the R8, the naturally aspirated V-10 will always be the best solution. But if you think about an engine lower than ten or eight cylinders also in this car, then there could be an alternative with a turbocharger. There could be.”
And it's also a near certainty that there will be more RS models and that more (if not most) of them will eventually find their way to the United States. “I wouldn't say it's necessary to have RS models for all,” Hollerweger said, “but I cannot say ‘this is too small' or ‘this is too big'—an RS1 could be a nice alternative, even if there is a very small market for these cars, as well as an RS Q7. I certainly wouldn't exclude that for the future at all.” So long as he starts including America in plans for the next-gen RS4 and RS6 Avants, we say Hollerweger can RS anything he damn well pleases.
Guangzhou, China - African migrants have been arriving in Guangzhou, China's third largest city ever since the Chinese economic boom began in the late 1990s.
Current estimates put their numbers anywhere from 20,000 to 200,000. The latter figure would place their population at almost two percent of Guangzhou's 13 million residents. In any event, Guangzhou's Africans constitute Asia's largest African community. The majority of them reside in a 10 square kilometre area in the central districts of Yuexiu and Baiyun locally known as "Chocolate City".
Many of Guangzhou's Africans are short term residents who arrive by plane on 30-day tourist visas with little more than the clothes on their backs and as much Chinese yuan as they and their families can cobble together. Their plan is to purchase cheap goods to sell back home, which may be anywhere from Lagos, Nigeria, to Freetown, Sierra Leone.
Abubakkar Barrie, 32, an MBA student from Sierra Leone, manages other traders' shipping by selling space in shipping containers. "I came to China because it is the centre of international business," he says.
Although he is excited by the opportunities available in Guangzhou, Barrie admits that there are cultural barriers for Africans in Guangzhou. "Although I work with many Chinese, I have never once been invited to their homes."
Barrie's friend Bah Umaru Alpha, 26, is worried about the Ebola outbreak in his home town of Kerema, but with his own business to run, a wife and a nine-month-old child, returning home is out of the question.
Unlike African migrants who have children with Chinese nationals, African couples in China have no access to state healthcare and education. “As my son gets older, I'm worried about him being allowed to go to school. He was born here, but he doesn't have the same rights as Chinese children,” Alpha said.
After several beta versions, tvOS 10.0.1 is now available for all fourth-generation Apple TVs. The software update was previously only available to registered developers for testing.
tvOS 10.0.1 is the first update to tvOS 10 which was released last month. The new version is a minor release that includes bug fixes and security improvements. A future update is expected to bring single sign-on.
This feature will let you sign in to your cable provider once, then be logged in to each available channel automatically rather than going through the set up process with special codes and Safari over and over and over.
The App Store will even present you with a list of all the available channels for your cable provider so you don't have to hunt for the right channels on your own.
How to update Apple TV to tvOS 10.0.1
Launch Settings app Navigate to System → Software Updates → Update Software tvOS will search for an available update, follow the on-screen prompts to proceed
After you prompt your Apple TV to update to the latest version of tvOS, your Apple TV will show a progress indicator on your screen and likely reboot two times. You will likely see a What's New splash screen highlighting new features after the installation is complete.
This process will manually check for the available update as soon as it becomes available. Even if you don't manually check for the latest software update, tvOS 10.0.1 will likely automatically download and install the tvOS update if you use the default settings.
How to check tvOS for automatic downloads
Launch Settings app Navigate to System → Software Updates and check that Automatically Update is toggled on
tvOS 10 is only available on the fourth-gen (and later in the future) Apple TV. Third-gen and earlier Apple TVs run a different operating system that no longer receives updates.
Justin Zhen was in his WeWork office in midtown Manhattan on July 19 when he published the blog post that would result in his startup, Thinknum, being removed from the co-working space three days later.
The post, “Deep Dive into WeWork's User Base as Hundreds of Members Cancel,” was an analysis that suggested customers of the trendy rental office-space company are increasingly canceling their memberships. The post also noted that the community events and “meaningful connections, both business and personal” that WeWork advertises to members ”have not been well received.”
“WeWork's all-important churn rate (number of cancellations divided by number of total members) historically has been around 1.2% on an annualized basis,” Zhen, a co-founder of Thinknum, wrote. “This churn rate has increased five times to over 6% in recent months.”
WeWork responded to Zhen with a cease-and-desist letter demanding that he remove the blog post from online publishing platform Medium and delete all the WeWork data that his fledging financial analysis company had collected. The letter stated that Thinknum had violated the terms of its WeWork membership, which forbid ”scraping, spidering, crawling” or using “other technology or software” to access WeWork data, according to a copy viewed by Quartz.
Zhen told Reuters on July 21 that he did not believe Thinknum had violated the terms of membership because the team collected data using WeWork's application programming interface, or API. But at 10:30am today (July 22), WeWork informed Thinknum via email that its membership had been terminated, “effective immediately.” Zhen told Quartz his firm was given 30 minutes to vacate the workspace.
WeWork is the world's ninth-richest startup, valued at $16 billion. It runs a network of co-working offices in 23 cities spread across seven countries and is also building out a new line of co-living spaces, branded as “WeLive.” WeWork outfits its offices with Silicon Valley-esque amenities such as arcade games and beer-on-tap, selling the promise that work can be at once productive, social, and fun. Its co-founder, Adam Neumann, attempting to describe what makes WeWork special, has called it “a feeling.”
But that valuation—like that of many other so-called unicorns—has recently come into question. Last week, Bloomberg reported that WeWork had in late April slashed its 2016 profit forecast by 78% and its revenue estimate by 14%. Bloomberg said the lower revenue projection was the result of building openings that had been delayed, at times for more than six months.
WeWork said in response to the Bloomberg story that the April document “does not reflect our robust operating momentum.” It also said the April document had been stolen and late last week sued an ex-employee, Joanna Strange, for the alleged theft.
As for Thinknum, it packed up with plans to decamp for another co-working space, potentially one without the social aspects of a WeWork property.
Thinknum co-founder Greg Ugwi said the firm stands by the numbers in its blog post and “did not violate” WeWork's terms.
“My view is that it touches a nerve,” Ugwi says. “A lot of private unicorns they are determined to control the narrative … It's people who get extremely vigilant about maintaining one glossy story, so anything that contradicts that, they react in irrational ways.”
A spokesman for WeWork told Quartz that Thinknum's findings were not true, and its methods of data collection were flawed. For example, WeWork said that Thinknum's analysis of the usage of WeWork's member network doesn't take into account that some of the office space company's largest members either do not allow their employees to access that network, or restrict access to it.
“This company scraped incomplete data from our member network, which violated the rules of our community,” the spokesman said in a statement. “The data they published and their associated conclusions are factually inaccurate and do not reflect our thriving business.”
This story was updated to include additional information from WeWork.

Grizzly bears. The biggest, baddest, fiercest, growliest apex predator to prowl the North American continent. Except, well, humans. Since arriving on the scene, people have pushed the Ursus arctos horribilis to the brink of extinction, and then, a few decades ago, threw them a lifeline in the form of the Endangered Species Act. For the iconic grizzly population living in and around the most famous US national park however, that protection could soon be removed.
The Yellowstone grizzlies have recovered remarkably under the Endangered Species Act. But the goal of the law is to get them off the list—once their populations become stable, and the threats to their habitat are mitigated. Which is why the US Fish and Wildlife Service, pointing to evidence of the recovery of the Yellowstone grizzly, recently proposed “delisting” the population and handing the management of the bears to state and tribal agencies, who could permit development, sanction trophy hunts, and allow other activities that would put the bruins in peril (Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, where they would still be protected, only make up a fraction of the bears' range in the area). Many environmentalists disagree. Some even claim that grizzly bears are more threatened than ever by climate change and human activity, and have questioned the science the FWS used to propose delisting. You might call it one bear of a problem. (Sorry.)
In the early 19th century these most feared of North American predators roamed as far north as Alaska, as far south as Mexico, as far west as the Pacific Ocean, and as far east as Kansas. But the settling of the West nearly wiped out continental grizzly bears except for some swathes of territory bleeding over the Canadian border, and one tear drop of habitat around Yellowstone—representing just 2 percent of its historic habitat—where, in the 1970s, the population teetered at fewer than 150. In 1975, the federal government intervened, granting the Yellowstone grizzlies protection under the Endangered Species Act, which limited hunting and development in the 34,000-square-mile Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (the national park itself is merely a tenth of the total area). Today, the only place you will find a grizzly bear outside of that area is on the California state flag.
Forty years of endangered species protection has helped the Yellowstone grizzlies rebound to around 700 individuals, and more than double their range (see maps below). A significant accomplishment. “The recovery of the Yellowstone grizzly bear represents a historic success for...wildlife conservation under the Endangered Species Act,” FWS director Dan Ashe said in a statement earlier this spring. Government monitors now say the grizzly population has reached carrying capacity—their habitat can sustain no more. These findings led the FWS to propose delisting the animal.
Yellowstone Science
Getting a species off the Endangered Species list is hard—in 40 years, US Fish and Game has only recovered and removed 35 of the more than 2,000 threatened or endangered species who have been on the list. The task of studying and monitoring grizzlies falls on a government research group called the Interagecy Grizzly Bear Study Team. IGBST (pronounced ‘igbeast,' we assume) has been hiking through and flying over grizzly habitat for decades, collecting data on the number of separate mother and cub families living in various parts of the ecosystem. Those scientists then run that data through a statistical toolcalled Chao2 and extrapolate the total population size.
IGBST scientists can use annual estimates from years back to calculate population growth or decline. Since the turn of the millennium, they've found that population growth has plateaued. Which is how they determined that the Yellowstone grizzlies are now at carrying capacity. “The core of the ecosystem has higher densities of females with cubs in the past decade than ever before,” says Frank van Manen, director of IBGST. “The population has started to fill up all the available habitat and young animals are dispersing out of those areas.”
Van Manen's team also attaches radio collars to grizzlies that beam tracking data to satellites, giving researchers realtime information about where grizzlies move and alerting them when they die. From this data, the IGBST can get a sense of the range and the survival rate of different gender and age bears. Van Manen says their research has shown the survival rate is stable—except for a decline in cub survival, which he believes is due to aggressive male bears, another sign of population density reaching its limit. The hypothesis is backed up by the fact that Yellowstone grizzly bears' range has more than doubled to 22,500 square miles of the total Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
So that's great news, right? The grizzlies, at the brink of extinction a few decades ago, are now bursting out of their habitat.
Not so fast, says wildlife biologist Dave Mattson, leading dissenting voice on the delisting proposal—and a former IGBST member. He looks at the data and sees a different story. “If we've reached carrying capacity in the core, it's actually because carrying capacity has dropped because of the loss of food,” he says. He points to evidence that four of the main grizzly bear food sources—whitebark pine seed, army cutworm moths, elk, and cutthroat trout—are declining thanks to drought, invasive species, and habitat loss. In fact, a prior attempt at delisting the Yellowstone grizzly bear was overturned by a US district court in 2009 in large part due to Mattson's research on how climate change-decimated whitebark pine (which the FWS has determined is eligible for endangered species status) could affect grizzly bears.
Mattson and others, including a group of 58 scientists led by Jane Goodall—who signed a letter to urging the FWS against delisting—believe the increase in grizzly bear range is actually due to the fact that bears are changing what they're feeding on and looking farther for food. “They've totally fucked it up,” says Mattson about the IGBST conclusions about the grizzly bear population's health. “They missed the mark pretty much entirely.”
Not only that, Mattson says, but the Yellowstone grizzly bears are isolated and still haven't been able to connect with the larger North American grizzly populations in Canada and Alaska. “That intrinsically makes them more vulnerable,” he says. While regulations are in place to protect habitat on federally-owned land—Read: Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and national forests—in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, state and privately-owned land could be logged, mined, or paved with roads. Wildlife managers won't have nearly as much recourse to prevent development there, and citizens will lose their ability to use the ESA to sue to stop it. This, Mattson says, could lead to more fragmentation of an already fragile habitat.
Other scientists agree that it's too soon to say the grizzly bear has recovered. “The population is facing an uncertain future right now,” says Sylvia Fallon, the director of wildlife conservation at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “We think full recovery means addressing the huge amounts of uncertainty around its population size, food sources, and isolation.” Grizzly bears have a very low reproductive rates to begin with, so even a couple dozen trophy-hunted bears (which state wildlife managers in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming will likely allow) could have serious repercussions for the population's health. Without legal hunting, over 40 grizzly bears diedlast year during or after encounters with humans—which have increased as bears range farther into areas where hikers hike, livestock range, and hunters stalk deer, elk, and other ungulates.
But van Manen counters that recent research shows even with declining sustenance like whitebark pine seeds, grizzly bears have proven very adaptable omnivores and have been able to switch to other food sources like bison carcass, ants, dandelions, and clover. "We have not seen changes in body mass of bears," he says. Furthermore, a genetic study of Yellowstone grizzly bears published last fall by the IGBST showed stable genetic diversity, and no reason to believe it would decline as long as the population stayed above 600. Even if that did happen, van Manen says, they could transport a bear from a northern population and have it mate with Yellowstone bears, a method proven successful with the Florida panther. In any case, the post-delisting conservation plan mandates continued monitoring of the population to makes sure it doesn't dip below 600 bears.
That evidence, plus the rest of the IGBST's findings have the FWS leaning towards delisting. "It is not the purpose of the ESA to list species in perpetuity," FWS spokeswoman Serena Baker said in an email. "Once the science indicates a species or population has recovered, it is the duty of the Service to delist it." Furthermore, if they don't the very integrity of the ESA—already under constant threat from conservative lawmakers—could be undermined. "The ESA needs success stories to strengthen the law, and the Yellowstone grizzly bear is the greatest success story of all," the recently-retired FWS grizzly bear recovery coordinator Chris Servheen told High Country News. The FWS has completed two public hearings this spring and received over 100,000 written comments.
The agency will sift through feedback and go through more peer review before making a final delisting decision by the end of the year. But even if they do not delist, the ESA hasn't necessarily failed. Out of all the species listed as threatened or endangered under the Act, only ten have gone extinct. Despite what Hugh Glass might have to say, that the Yellowstone grizzly hasn't joined that group is something to roar about.

The latest bold claims made in the US National Security Agency's leaked PowerPoint presentation on its PRISM internet surveillance program suggest that the agency is able to monitor communications in realtime, despite earlier avid denials by tech companies. The government may also be accessing much information without tech companies' explicit knowledge, but a pair of even newer reports in Bloomberg and Reuters indicate that many big tech companies actually knowingly cooperate much more extensively with US intelligence agencies than previously acknowledged.
Tech firms including Microsoft are said to voluntarily give advanced warning to the US government of vulnerabilities in software products sold to governments overseas before they are patched, allowing US agencies to effectively use them to conduct foreign surveillance. Microsoft's corporate vice president of corporate communications Frank X. Shaw confirmed to Bloomberg that the company tips-off multiple government agencies to vulnerabilities, but said this was designed for risk assessment and management.
Another company that Bloomberg highlights is McAfee, a subsidiary of Intel, which is said to be in regular cooperation with the NSA as well as the FBI and CIA. The firm reportedly provides government intelligence agencies with insights gained from its monitoring of global internet traffic, which includes cyber espionage by "foreign powers." But this type of activity is in many way businesses as usual for Silicon Valley, as Reuters points out, diving deep into the history of the US tech industry to note that many early tech giants got their start working on military or intelligence projects. The Reuters report notes that in order to maintain the integrity of tech companies with international customers, the government typically works through a thriving industry of third-party firms that offer services capable of compromising "virtually every major software vendor." Altogether, the new reports a reminder that although the US government and tech companies often clash when it comes to business regulations, on national security matters, they are often more in sync than they let on.
Weather is to blame for the delay of the long-awaited Goliath roller coaster, billed as the fastest and steepest wooden coaster in the world, according to officials at Six Flags Great America.
"Thanks to Mother Nature's freezing temperatures this winter and unseasonably cool and rainy spring, the final touches on Goliath have been delayed," the Gurnee theme park said in a statement this morning.
A new opening date will be announced later this week, according to the statement.
Goliath was scheduled to open May 31 and promised to hurl riders down an 85-degree, 180-foot cliff before sending them into curves, two upside-down twists and a zero gravity stall, according to a Tribune report. The coaster is set to be 165 feet tall and will plunge into a 15-foot deep tunnel for a record-setting 180-foot fall.
The ride marks the first new roller coaster at Six Flags since X Flight in 2012. Wooden roller coasters have been edged out by steel coasters, but recent advances in 3-D computer modeling and coaster technology have allowed new wooden rides to twist and turn like never before.

WASHINGTON — Over porterhouse steak and cherry pie at a desert estate in California earlier this month, President Obama delivered a stern lecture to President Xi Jinping about China's disputes with its neighbors. If it is going to be a rising power, he scolded, it needs to behave like one.
The next morning, Mr. Xi punched back, accusing the United States of the same computer hacking tactics it attributed to China. It was, Mr. Obama acknowledged, “a very blunt conversation.”
Ten days later, in Northern Ireland, Mr. Obama had another tough meeting with a prickly leader, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. At odds with him over the Syrian civil war, Mr. Obama tried to lighten the mood by joking about how age was depleting their athletic skills. Mr. Putin, a decade older and fending off questions at home about his health, seemed sensitive on the point. “The president just wants to get me to relax,” he said with a taut smile.
While tangling with the leaders of two cold war antagonists of the United States is nothing new, the two bruising encounters in such a short span underscore a hard reality for Mr. Obama as he heads deeper into a second term that may come to be dominated by foreign policy: his main counterparts on the world stage are not his friends, and they make little attempt to cloak their disagreements in diplomatic niceties.
Second-year Vikings defensive lineman B.J. Dubose tore his anterior cruciate ligament during today's organized team activity at Winter Park, according to a league source, and is expected to miss the entire 2016 season.
Dubose suffered the knee injury this morning during an 11-on-11 drill, crumpling to the turf inside the team's indoor practice facility. Moments later he was helped up and he limped away to the athletic trainer's room.
Dubose was a sixth-round pick last spring. He spent most of the 2015 season on the practice squad before being promoted to the 53-man roster for the playoff loss to the Seahawks. He did not play in that game.
This spring, Dubose was competing for a roster spot and playing time behind starting defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd. Prior to his injury today, Dubose lined up with the second-team defense. Veteran Tom Johnson was with the first-stringers as Floyd sat out the practice with an injury.
Now Dubose figures to spend the 2016 season on injured reserve as ACL injuries typically require at least six months of recovery time.
Turns out, it's the guy who can guard all the other MVP candidates, including LeBron James, left, that impressed our NBA writer most. (Larry W. Smith/EPA)
When this NBA season began, it was supposed to be a six-month long buildup to the first Finals rubber match, between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers. And, as the regular season closes Wednesday and the playoffs begin this weekend, those teams both remain the favorites to make that feat happen.
But coming into the season, the expectation was that the foregone conclusion would remove all the drama from the proceedings, and boredom and drudgery would follow because everyone knew what was going to happen.
That couldn't have been farther from the truth, and the biggest reason is this season's race for NBA Most Valuable Player.
The MVP race is always a significant story line throughout any season, as one would expect. But this season has been different, because four future Halls of Fame players — LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, James Harden and Kawhi Leonard — are all in the midst of arguably the best seasons of their respective careers.
Between the explosion of offense throughout the NBA this season, each of the four players having a narrative arc (James being the best player, Westbrook thriving without Kevin Durant, Harden leading the resurgent Rockets and Leonard pushing the Spurs to the league's second-best record) and each having his fair share of highlight-reel performances, it's the best MVP race in league history. It has even surpassed the 1962 race that's come up so many times this year, one in which Bill Russell won the award ahead of Wilt Chamberlain, who averaged 50 points and 26 rebounds, and Oscar Robertson, who averaged a triple-double.
[The 15-year chain reaction that led to the NBA's current offensive explosion]
So, after months of deliberation and internal debate, here are The Washington Post's official picks for the five spots on this year's MVP ballot:
5. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks
The top four spots have gotten so much attention, yet the race for the fifth spot on the ballot is equally competitive. Both Chris Paul and Durant have been incredible when healthy this season, but each missed about a quarter of the season with injuries. John Wall and Isaiah Thomas have been equally outstanding, dueling for the honor of being the Eastern Conference's top point guard, while Stephen Curry has only spent the past several weeks playing like he did en route to winning the award by a unanimous vote last year.

All of them would be worthy choices, but aren't the choice here. Instead, the fifth spot on this ballot is going to Antetokounmpo, the rapidly ascending superstar forward for the Milwaukee Bucks. It was only a few months ago that Antetokounmpo agreed to a contract extension for a bit below the maximum salary for next season, and had yet to make an all-star team.
Now he's blossomed into a bona fide superstar, a terror at both ends of the court who is a three-point shot away from becoming an unstoppable force. As it is, he's averaging 23.1 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 1.9 blocks per game — leading the Bucks in all five categories, becoming just the fifth player in NBA history to lead his team in all five — as he's improved virtually across the board for a fourth straight season. Most impressively, he's doing it all at age 22, and won't turn 23 until December.
The best is yet to come for The Greek Freak, and it will be so much fun to watch it all happen.
4. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers
From here on out, these top four spots could be divvied up in any order and it would be justified. Frankly, those arguing against that have been part of the frustrating portion of this MVP debate. Part of that is the age we live in, where there has to be a negative reaction to everything, as opposed to simply celebrating the incredible nature of this season, and the performances these guys have all given. Part of it, too, is the desire for each camp to be right, and to see their player lifted to the top of the heap.
One of them has to finish fourth, though, and James wound up being the choice. It's easy to take him for granted at this point, given that he's now in his 14th season, is putting up astronomical numbers (26.4 points, 8.6 rebounds and 8.7 assists) and remains the first choice if one could have their pick of anyone in the league to start a team.
But for as dominant as James has been, his team has tailed off in recent weeks, and likely won't even finish in first place in the East. In a race where every little bit counts, that turned out to be the line of demarcation.
3. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder
There's no question Westbrook has been sensational this season. And his pursuit of becoming the first player since Robertson to average a triple-double over a season, coupled with propping up the Thunder in the wake of Durant's departure, gives him a very compelling and easy-to-spell-out narrative for how he should win the award. That doesn't even factor in Westbrook's remarkable performances in the clutch this season, which I think is the most compelling case for him.

Westbrook has several factors working in his favor. For many people, the triple-double is the reason he should win the award, full stop. But in a season where offenses are exploding like never before, it's hard to honestly look at Westbrook's 31.9 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists and say that it's dramatically better than Harden's 29.3 points, 8.1 rebounds and 11.3 assists.
Then there are the preseason expectations surrounding the Thunder. I was lower on the Thunder than virtually everyone else, making one of my 10 bold predictions that they would miss the playoffs (this, like most bold predictions, proved to be too bold). But Oklahoma City was projected by many to finish in the mid-40s in wins and finish somewhere in the middle of the Western Conference playoff picture. Now, the Thunder have only managed to do that because of Westbrook's ridiculous clutch performances, including his remarkable game-winner Sunday against Denver to cap his record-breaking 42nd triple-double of the season. But Oklahoma City is performing right about in line with where it was supposed to be — not well above it, as many have argued in recent weeks.
There's also the fact that, while detractors say Westbrook's team is hurting him, it actually isn't set up all that dissimilarly from how Harden's is set up. In many ways, this year's Thunder are a souped-up version of the 2001 Philadelphia 76ers: a team with one phenomenal scorer surrounded by droves of athletic players who rebound (or, in many cases, allow Westbrook to grab uncontested rebounds) and play defense. This is a big factor in Oklahoma City's success in close games, as Westbrook has been free to shoot every time down the court, and his ability to create his own shot allows Thunder Coach Billy Donovan to surround him with stout defenders to help slow down the opposition.
That's not to say Westbrook hasn't been sensational; he has been. That's also not to say that Westbrook shouldn't win the award; if he does, then it will be well deserved, and a fitting tribute to a thrilling season. But in a season where so many things are equal across the board, the fact that Westbrook's team is going to wind up 8 to 10 wins behind Houston, 15 or so behind San Antonio and isn't expected to make it out of the first round tips the scales ever so slightly against him, and leaves him third on this ballot.
2. James Harden, Houston Rockets
Many of the arguments for Harden and Westbrook are similar. Harden has been equally terrific, as the stats above indicate, along with another: he is the first player to average 25 points and create 25 points per game via assists in a season. He also has been a terrific catalyst for Houston's turnaround, seamlessly fitting into Mike D'Antoni's system and running it like he's been a point guard all his life, as opposed to a shooting guard converted into one — a part of his play this season that has been undervalued.
[With a month left, this poll shows a clear favorite for MVP]
But, like Westbrook, Harden has a team that's tailor-made to his skill set around him, with a fleet of shooters and able defenders to hit with pinpoint passes and make up for his less-than-stellar individual defense.
So why is Harden ahead? Well, the fact that his team is several spots ahead in the standings after many (though not me) predicted the reverse is part of it. So, too, is the way he's had to change his game and adapt to a new position, even if he is a guy who is used to having the ball in his hands. Anyone who saw Harden play last season knows he has gone from one of the guys who was hardest to watch in the league to one of the easiest in the span of a single year, and that is a credit to him buying into what D'Antoni wanted him to do.
And, in most years, that would be enough to tip the scales in his favor. This year, though, isn't one of them.
1. Kawhi Leonard, San Antonio Spurs
Wait a minute. Leonard? Not Harden and Westbrook, the two names that have dominated this conversation for the past few months?
Yes. Leonard.
Here's the case. The first part is obvious: While James, Westbrook and Harden are largely regular season designated hitters, contributing only on offense, Leonard remains a terrifying defensive presence, and is the best perimeter defender in the league by leaps and bounds. That should count for something. So, too, should Leonard's insane efficiency. He dominates the ball, closing in on a 30 percent usage rate while rarely turning the ball over and posting a 61 percent true shooting percentage.

But the true bulwark of the case is in what surrounds Leonard in San Antonio. Yes, they are the Spurs, and yes, they still have Gregg Popovich as their coach. This, though, is not your father's Spurs team.
LaMarcus Aldridge, who was supposed to be the team's second all-star behind Leonard, has taken a step backward. Danny Green is a perfectly acceptable starting shooting guard, but Tony Parker has plummeted to the bottom of the starting point guard ranks in the NBA. Pau Gasol has been rightly relegated to the bench in favor of Dewayne Dedmon — a nice player, but who is averaging career highs of 5.2 points and 6.5 rebounds in 17 minutes a night.
And yet, despite all of that — plus a bench featuring Patty Mills, Gasol, David Lee and 38-year-old Manu Ginobili — San Antonio is on pace to win more than 60 games and have the second-best record in the NBA.
Now, this isn't a home for the “wins are the only thing that matter” argument. But it's hard to objectively look at this Spurs team and say that it's demonstrably better than the rosters Harden and Westbrook have around them. Leonard has led his roster to seven more wins than Rockets and 15 more than that Thunder.
And in a debate over what's valuable, it's hard to find a more valuable number than that.
If you want to find out if a digital nematode is alive, try asking it.
Fancy living in a computer? Contributors to the OpenWorm project aim to make life inside a computer a (virtual) reality. In recent years, various brain projects have focused funding on moonshot science initiatives to map, model and ultimately understand the human brain: the computer that helps humans to cognito that they sum. These are similar in feel to the human genome project of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Despite the inherent contradictions of the oft-trotted trope that the human brain is the “most complex thing in the universe,” it is indeed quite a complicated machine, decidedly more complex than the human genome. Understanding how it works will take more than mapping every connection, which is akin to knowing every node in a circuit but having no idea what each component is. A multivalent approach at the levels of cells, circuits, connections, and mind offers the most complete picture. OpenWorm coordinator Stephen Larson et al. aim to start by understanding something a little bit simpler: the determinate 304 neuron brain and accompanying body of Caenorhabditis elegans, a soil-dwelling nematode worm that has served as a workhorse in biology for decades.
Genome, Brain
The connectome, a neural wiring diagram of the worm's brain, has been mapped. The simulation of the worm at the cellular level is an ongoing open-source software program. The first human genome was sequenced only 3 years after the first C. elegans genome, a similar pace for full biological simulation in silico would mean that digital humans, or a reasonable facsimile, are possible within our lifetimes. At the point when these simulations of people are able to fool observers will these entities be alive and conscious? Have rights? Pay taxes? If a digital person claims the validity of their own consciousness should we take their word for it, or determine some metric for ascertaining the consciousness of a simulated person based on our own inspection? For answers to questions of existence and sapience we can turn to our own experience (believing as we do that we are conscious entities), and the venerable history of the questions as discussed in science fiction.
Conversation with the chatbot (a conversational precursor to intelligent software)CleverBot from 2014 December 24.
In the so-called golden age of science fiction characters tended to be smart, talented, and capable. Aside from an unnerving lack of faults and weakness, overall the protagonists were fundamentally human. The main difference between the audience and the actors in these stories was access to better technology. But it may be that this vision of a human future is comically (tragically?) myopic. Even our biology has been changing more quickly as civilisation and technologies develop. If we add a rate of technological advance that challenges the best-educated humans to keep pace, a speed-up of the rate of change in average meteorological variables, and human-driven selective pressure, the next century should be interesting to say the least. When those unobtainyl transferase pills for longevity finally kick in, generational turnover can no longer be counted on to ease adaptation to a step-change in civilisation.
Greg Egan (who may or may not be a computer program) has been writing about software-based people for over two decades. When the mind of a human is not limited to run on a single instance of its native hardware, new concepts such as “local death” and traveling by transmission emerge intrinsically. Most of the characters in novels from writers such as Egan waste little time questioning whether they will still exist if they have to resort to a backup copy of themselves. As in flesh-and-blood humans, persistence of memory plays a key role in the sense of self, but is not nearly so limited. If a software person splits themselves to pursue two avenues of interest, they may combine their experiences upon their reunion, rejoining as a single instance with a transiently bifurcated path. If the two instances of a single person disagree as to their sameness, they may decide to go on as two different people. These simulated people would be unlikely to care (beyond their inevitable battle for civil rights) whether you consider them to be alive and sapient or not, any more so than the reader is likely to disbelieve their own sapience.
Many of the thought experiments associated with software-based person-hood are prompted by a human perception of dubiousness in duplicity: two instances of a person existing at the same time, but not sharing a single experience, don't feel like the same person. Perhaps as the OpenWorm project develops we can watch carefully for signs of animosity and existential crises among a population of digital C. elegans twinned from the same starting material. We (or our impostorous digital doppelgängers, depending on your perspective) may find out for ourselves what this feels like sooner than we think.
2014-12-29 – Leading comic edited for improved comedic effect
A couple in Wilsonville, Oregon had their home broken into while they were sleeping only to find out that both of their Motorola Droid Android Phones and other valuable electronics had been stolen. The thief must not have known the rightful owner had installed an Android Application called Lookout because soon after he began taking pictures of himself with one of the Droid cameras.
The application performs a backup service at midnight every night and the self-portrait pictures of the robber were uploaded to the web as part of the service.
GOTCHYA! The suspect was a 15-year old male who police believe had been scoping out the victim's house for quite some time. They also believe there is at least one accomplice since the pictures were taken by a third (or second?) party. Pictures from the phone, only some of which are displayed below, were used to identify the suspect.
A local television news station ran with the story and you can watch the video here. While they show the Droid in all its Android glory and briefly picture the MyLookout web interface, they don't go into depth on either.
Because the thieving boy was only 15-years old they would not disclose whether or not he was a jealous iPhone fanboy trying to secretly indulge in his love for Android.
[Thanks John!]
This is the point in the 2014 midterm election when each party has to take a hard look at its spending priorities, and redirect its money to the the closest races. And it looks like the National Republican Senatorial Committee has chosen the candidate it'll cut loose first — Terri Lynn Land of Michigan. David Eggert of the Associated Press reports that the NRSC is canceling $1 million in late October ads that were to run on Land's behalf. This paves the way for the Democratic candidate, Rep. Gary Peters, to pick up an easy win in the open seat race.
If you've been reading Vox's Senate forecast roundup, you won't be surprised by this at all — the most optimistic forecast for Land gave her only a 13 percent chance to win this morning:
Though the Democrats have gotten mostly bad news in the battle for the Senate recently, it's obviously a win for them to be able to put away a once-competitive race. Land's performance has been a major disappointment to Republicans, who initially viewed her as a promising recruit. But after some early awkwardness on the campaign trail and with the press, Land drastically curtailed her campaign schedule, apparently in fear of gaffes. Recently, Dave Catanese of US News had a great roundup of Land's disappearance from the trail, dubbing her "the invisible Senate candidate."
The Arkansas Republican Party sure seems to have an interesting line-up of Senate candidates. Check out this statement from retired Army officer Curtis Reynolds.
“When I joined the military I took an oath to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic,” Reynolds said. “I never thought it would be domestic, but in today's world I do believe we have enemies here. It's time for people to stand up. It's time for us to speak out.”
He added: “We need someone to stand up to Barack Obama and his policies. We must protect our culture, our Christian identity.”
When he got to the Q&A session, he said that he would be careful with his answers, “I don't want to do a Kim Hendren,” and later clarified that he was not categorizing President Obama as a domestic enemy.Kim Hendren is a state Senator who referred to Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as “that Jew,” and subsequently apologized — saying he meant to state his support for “traditional values.”
Another candidate is businessman Curtis Coleman, who said people need vaccinations to visit Southeastern Arkansas.
A McKenzie friend assists a litigant in person in a court of law in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia by prompting, taking notes and quietly giving advice. They need not be legally trained or have any professional legal qualifications.
The right to a McKenzie friend was established in the 1970 case of McKenzie v McKenzie.[1] Although in many cases a McKenzie friend may be an actual friend, it is often somebody with knowledge of the area and the presumption is heavily in favour of admitting a McKenzie friend into court.[2] He or she may be liable for any misleading advice given to the litigant in person[citation needed] but is not covered by professional indemnity insurance.
A similar, modified principle exists in Singapore. The role is distinct from that of a next friend or of an amicus curiae.
Origin [ edit ]
McKenzie v. McKenzie was a divorce case in England.[3] Levine McKenzie, who was petitioning for divorce, had been legally aided but the legal aid had been withdrawn before the case went to court. Unable to fund legal representation, McKenzie had broken off contact with his solicitors, Geoffrey Gordon & Co.. However, one day before the hearing, Geoffrey Gordon & Co. sent the case to an Australian barrister in London, Ian Hanger, whose qualifications in law in Australia did not allow him to practise as a barrister in London. Hanger hoped to sit with his client to prompt him, take notes and suggest questions in cross-examination, thereby providing what quiet assistance he could from the bar table to a man representing himself. The trial judge ordered Hanger not to take any active part in the case (except to advise McKenzie during adjournments) and to sit in the public gallery of the court. Hanger assumed his limited role was futile and did not return for the second day of the trial.[3]
The case went against McKenzie, who then appealed to the Court of Appeal on the basis that he had been denied representation. On 12 June 1970, the Court of Appeal ruled that the judge's intervention had deprived McKenzie of the assistance to which he was entitled and ordered a retrial.[4]
Ian Hanger AM QC, the original McKenzie friend, is now a Queen's Counsel (QC) at the Queensland Bar.[3][5]
In specific jurisdictions [ edit ]
Singapore [ edit ]
In September 2006, the Subordinate Courts of Singapore started a pilot project called the Lay Assistant Scheme in which persons, usually with some legal knowledge, attend hearings with litigants who are not represented by lawyers to advise them on non-legal issues and help them with administrative tasks. The scheme, a modification of the U.K.'s McKenzie friend system, is intended to assist litigants who are not eligible for legal aid as they have an annual salary exceeding S$10,000 but cannot afford a lawyer.[citation needed] For the litigant to qualify, the other party must be legally represented.
Lay assistants are not allowed to act as lawyers and may not address the court; any breach of court rules may render them liable to a maximum fine of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.
Plans for introducing McKenzie friends in court proceedings were first announced by Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong in May 2006. Students from the Pro Bono Group of the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore, have been participating in the scheme.[6]
England and Wales [ edit ]
In English courts, where a case is being heard in private, the use of a McKenzie friend has sometimes been contentious. This is a particular problem in family court hearings, where it has been held that the nature of the case is so confidential that no one other than the litigants and their professional legal representatives should be admitted to the court.
A 2005 Court of Appeal case, In the matter of the children of Mr O'Connell, Mr Whelan and Mr Watson,[7] clarified the law in this area. The result of the appeal has legitimised the use of McKenzie friends in the family court and allowed the litigant to disclose confidential court papers to the McKenzie friend.
England and Wales allow fee charging McKenzie friends, who may charge for their services, including the giving of legal advice. A recent report by the Legal Service Consumer Panel found that fee charging McKenzie friends were a net benefit. The report stated, "They should be viewed as providing valuable support that improves access to justice in the large majority of cases."[8][9]
Scotland [ edit ]
Scotland has a separate legal system from England and Wales. The first recorded use of McKenzie friends in Scotland was in April 2007 in the case TB & AM v. The Authority Reporter.[10] The one major difference between England and Scotland is that in Scotland McKenzie friends are not permitted to receive remuneration.

SOMEWHERE IN THE AIR, United States — On the first day of the Winter Meetings, I discovered that my hotel room for the week was a few doors down from a section of rooms and suites dedicated to the Chicago Cubs. So either I have a lot of juice with Marriott or the Cubs have very little juice.
They were a happy group as they came in and out, and for good reason. The Cubs are the reigning champions and they're the heavy favorites going into 2017. Every other team at the Gaylord National Resort was chasing Theo Epstein and his guys. The Giants, after landing closer Mark Melancon, feel they have the firepower to compete with the Cubs.
The Melancon move is the big one of the Giants' offseason and it obscured just about everything else. Here are some other notes, quotes and rumors from five days at the Winter Meetings:
--- Bobby Evans said the Aroldis Chapman deal ($86 million) came in right around where the Giants expected. The two sides never met in person, and while the Giants kept tabs on the Chapman market, he was always viewed as an unlikely choice. Part of that has to do with a 30-game suspension last season for a domestic violence incident. Evans said the off-field stuff was “not lost on us.” The Giants knew many of their fans were strongly opposed to a Chapman deal.
“Our hearts and minds were really focused on one guy,” Evans said as he discussed the closer market. It was Melancon, and the Giants got the guy who will now head a bullpen that blew 30 saves during the regular season.
Evans took some good-natured shots at that number, by the way. He pointed out that many of those “blown saves” came in the sixth or seventh innings and the Giants won a lot of those games. The more important number for the front office was ninth-inning blown saves that led to losses. The Giants lost nine such games, including five in September.
“That's the difference,” Evans said. “If you reduce that number to five or four, then that's maybe the difference in your division.”
The Giants finished four games behind the Dodgers.
--- Joe Maddon said his biggest fear in the postseason was facing Johnny Cueto in Game 5.
--- Angel Pagan was not at the ballpark for the final game of the season. He had an injection in his injured back and was allowed to stay home to try and recover. The Giants told Pagan to prepare for a Game 5, but some team officials believe his postseason was probably over regardless of how far the Giants got.
--- It was a little surprising, by the way, how little mention there was of Pagan and other Giants free agents. Pagan was briefly connected to the Orioles at one point but otherwise his name has not come up. There are no Gregor Blanco rumors, and nothing significant with Sergio Romo, Jake Peavy, Javier Lopez or Santiago Casilla.
Giants people who have talked to Romo say he has at least a couple of offers and he's confident he'll find a good fit. Lopez is said to be headed for retirement unless an East Coast team (he lives in Georgia) makes a great offer. Peavy is said to be ready to fight for a job as a non-roster invitee in spring training. It seems the majority of the ex-Giants might have to go the non-roster route. Currently, none are expected to return to San Francisco.
--- Gordon Beckham is technically a “Giants free agent” and several people in the clubhouse approacedh management to relay what a positive impact Beckham had in his week there. He is the kind of energetic, ball-busting presence that helps over a 162-game season, and everyone in the organization loved having him around, but they're looking for power bats right now when it comes to the bench.
--- Ramiro Pena is close to a deal to return as a non-roster invitee. The Giants will also add a catcher for Triple-A depth. They're selecting from a group that includes former Dodgers and Cubs catcher Tim Federowicz.
--- There will be new managers up and down the minor league system. The affiliates are expected to announce those choices soon.
--- At the risk of wiping out a bunch of future "The Player to be Named Later has not been named" tweets, here's how it works: The Giants gave the Mariners a small list of prospects they'll watch in spring training, and they'll scout them and choose one player as the return for Chris Heston. It will not be a significant prospect.
--- Under Armour will be the exclusive uniform provider of MLB starting in 2020, and all jerseys will have a small Under Armour logo on the chest. No exceptions, from the awful Diamondbacks jerseys to the Yankees pinstripes to the Giants. It was bound to happen eventually. The Giants have some of Under Armour's most prominent baseball players, including Buster Posey, Brandon Belt and Joe Panik.
--- The Giants never had any intention of pursuing a reunion with Pablo Sandoval. If they can add depth at third, they will, but for now Eduardo Nuñez is slated to be the opening day starter. Keep in mind, too, that Christian Arroyo will primarily play third base in the minors from now on.
--- Bill Hayes, who was relieved of his duties as first-base coach, will stay with the big league staff. His exact role has not been determined. Roberto Kelly will not return in a different role.
--- CSN did a bunch of one-on-one interviews this week, and two of them — Evans and Bruce Bochy — are available here as podcasts. If you're a fan of the podcast, please consider hitting subscribe on iTunes. It's good for the pod.
--- In case you missed it: Here's an explanation of why the Giants are unlikely to add an expensive outfielder. The Giants currently have four players set for the WBC. Hensley Meulens will manage the Netherlands. Ryan Vogelsong helped Melancon choose the Giants. Bochy on if he has any postseason regrets.
--- Melancon will be introduced at a 1 p.m. press conference on Friday. It will air on CSN Bay Area and you can stream it on this website.
It isn't often that we spend an entire week talking about a Congressional Budget Office report and its implications, but the one currently occupying Washington's attention—about the effects of the Affordable Care Act on the labor force—is actually pretty revealing. To catch you up, the CBO said that due to the fact that under the ACA people are no longer tied to jobs they'd prefer to leave because they can't get health insurance on the individual market ("job lock"), many will do things like retire early, take time off to stay at home with kids, or quit and start businesses. They projected that these departures will add up to the equivalent of 2 to 2.5 million full-time positions. At first, Republicans cried "Obamacare will kill 2 million jobs!", but when everyone, including the CBO's director, said that was a blatantly misleading reading of what the report actually said, they changed their tune. And here's where it gets interesting, because this debate is getting to the heart of what work means, what freedom is—and for whom—and just what kind of economy we want to have.
Paul Ryan may have been the first Republican to articulate the new attack based on the CBO's report, when in a hearing on Wendnesday he lamented that fewer Americans would "get on the ladder of life, to begin working, getting the dignity of work, getting more opportunities, rising the income, joining the middle class." The argument was quickly picked up by others. "I think any law you pass that discourages people from working can't be a good idea. Why would we want to do that? " asked Senator Roy Blunt on Fox News Sunday. Representative Tom Cole said the same thing on This Week: "Anything that discourages work—and that's essentially what the CBO found, that this discourages some people from working, not a good thing at a time when the economy's still struggling." Representative Trey Gowdy said, "What the liberals and the Democrats want you to believe is, 'Well, but you'll have time to write poetry.' Well, that's great until you try and buy your grandkid a birthday present or you try and pay the heating bill."
You might read that and wonder, "Just how dumb do they think people are?" If you're, say, a 63-year-old who has enough savings to retire but doesn't want to wait until you're 65 and can get Medicare, the fact that you can now buy private insurance doesn't mean you've failed to "get on the ladder of life." Nobody is going to say, "Wait—I can buy insurance now, even though I once had cancer? Woo-hoo, no more work for me, ever!"
But to be honest, I'm a little torn about how far to go in interpreting the arguments Republicans are making. On one hand, it's obvious that they are saying what they are because they feel obligated to take any and every opportunity to cry that Obamacare is destroying America, and they'll do that no matter what the facts are. If the CBO report had said that the ACA had no effect at all on job lock, they'd probably be arguing exactly the opposite of what they are now, that it was diminishing Americans' freedom by keeping them in jobs they hate.
On the other hand, it's hard to say that at the moment they're not being candid about what they really believe. Job lock never really bothered them before, and I think that's because it's a case of the market diminishing people's freedom. Conservatives get very upset when the government diminishes freedom, but if the market does it, well them's the breaks. If you got screwed by market forces, then that just means you're a loser, and they're the party of winners. David Atkins may go a little far here, but he's right to point to a basic difference in how people of different ideologies view what it means to be human:
It is not an inaccurate or extreme statement to declare that ideological Republicans do not understand what it means to be human. They view human beings as economic units to be plugged at their lowest possible price into a maximally efficient market that provides the greatest possible returns on investment to the wealthy few, with any resulting human resentment and misery dulled by humility before a pleasure-fearing angry God promising rewards to the obedient in the hereafter. It is a dark, meager, shriveled and cramped vision of humanity.
I'd modify that to say that while most conservatives may view lives devoted to non-money-making endeavors as frivolous, it's only when certain people take advantage of the kind of freedom we're talking about that they get genuinely perturbed. They aren't campaigning for a higher estate tax so the Paris Hiltons of the world will be forced to get jobs and contribute meaningfully to society instead of laying about all day spending their forebears' money. It's the idea of someone of modest means having the ability to organize their lives to work less that they find morally intolerable.
But conservatives should be quite satisfied with the way the American economy is organized, particularly compared to our peer nations. Unions are a desiccated husk of what they once were, leaving workers with little or no power. Wages are stagnant and benefits are shrinking, while corporate profits and the share of wealth held by those at the top are at or near all-time highs. Our safety net is, by international standards, quite meager. The United States is the only advanced industrialized democracy that does not mandate by law that everyone get paid vacation. If you're lucky enough to have it, chances are you get two weeks at most. The European Union, by contrast, requires four weeks of paid vacation for all workers, and some countries in Europe go beyond even that.
In other words, this is the economy conservatives built. And yet when just one area of uncertainty is removed for ordinary people—the fear that you'll lose your health coverage if you leave your job or work fewer hours—they begin delivering lectures to the lesser folk about "the dignity of work." This is from a bunch of rich white guys who spend their days hobnobbing with other rich white guys. What I'd suggest is that they ask the people who clean their toilets about how much dignity and fulfillment they derive from their work, and then ask them whether they'd feel less dignified if they knew they could leave their jobs and still get health coverage. For a group of people who spend so much time talking about "economic freedom," conservatives seem awfully hesitant to let to many people taste it.
In the real economy—not the economy of a Republican congressman's imagining, where the only perspective that matters is that of the guy in the corner office, but the real economy—bosses are sometimes kind and sometimes beastly, compensation is sometimes fair and sometimes stingy, and for most people, work is the thing you do so you can carve out a little bit of time to do the things you'd rather be doing. It would be a wonderful world if everyone drew limitless fulfillment, engagement, and purpose from their work. But this is not that world.
Unfortunately, government can't make everyone love their jobs so much they leap out of bed in the morning. But what it can do is stop the gross injustices, keep the ruthless from harming the helpless, soften the market's cruelties and give people at least a chance to reach the kind of lives they want. Is that too much to ask?

Battle of Britain Act II, Adlerangriff (Eagle Attack)
Bf 110 attacked by Hawker Hurricane
Clouds gathered to the east, valiant men watched the menace move effortlessly against the westerly wind, Gallic forests sprouting green wings lifted from the ground and moved unto Britain, bearing broken black crosses. Belts tight, mask on, fire tubes ready, the sky riders charge into the fray, fates cast to the wind.
Vigilant for the coming storm
Everything that happened weeks before, the birth of the assault glider, the unstoppable juggernaut of the German army, the swarm of enemy aircraft rending the air and the utter collapse of its biggest ally France left Britain devastated and in shock. This defeat left a substantial amount of Royal Armies heavy weapons destroyed or abandoned on the continent. In the narrow channel the Royal Navy would be easy to spot and thus significantly more vulnerable to attacks than in open waters. Only the Royal Air Force offered the best hope of stopping them, but after losing a substantial amount of men and material on the continent the situation looked dire little if any time to regroup and rearm. The initial battles between the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe was but a prelude, the first act in a Shakespearian like play, a parade of machines and men, sizing up each other for what will come, but gave little on what was to come
Not since the 11th-century Norman invasion was a force able to overcome the natural protection of the English Channel but the advent of aircraft made it all but useless. There was great fear of an air armada eliminating coastal defenses followed by waves of assault gliders disgorging thousands of airborne troops to quickly defeat Britain like it did on the continent just weeks earlier. For the first time ever control of the skies was more important than land or sea and most radical change in warfare since the mounted cavalry.
High altitude condensation trails left by RAF and Luftwaffe aircraft.
The Luftwaffe had every advantage in superior numbers of the most advanced war planes then produced to battle hardened warriors from the Spanish Civil War to the Battle of France, however the RAF where not to be trifled with, boasting large numbers of quick to produce, rugged and dependable Hawker Hurricanes and the superior Supermarine Spitfire that was every bit as good as the best the Luftwaffe could throw that them. Britain was ready for this epic battle, it knew it had to win.
On August 13th and the first mega raid on Britain took place. Dubbed “Adlertag” (Eagle day) by Göring and the start of “Adlerangriff” (Eagle Attack), hundreds of Luftwaffe aircraft directly attacked radar, forward RAF airfields, and command installations in wave after wave. The air was full of shadowy objects, the sky painted with a thousand white streaks of contrails, and here and there a column made of smoke from a falling craft. The carnage caused those on the ground to hide from the rain of metal objects, and occasional bodies, falling on them.
Two key Senate races that will help determine which party controls the upper chamber are effectively tied just days before the midterm elections, according to new polls.
The CNN/ORC International polls of the campaigns in Iowa and North Carolina, released late Friday, found both races to be within the margin of error. In Iowa, Republican Joni Ernst holds a narrow, two-point lead over Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley for the open seat. In North Carolina, incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is clinging to a two-point lead over Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis.

Republicans need a net pick-up of six Senate seats to recapture the majority. Political forecasters see that as increasingly likely, but the campaign remains very close ahead of Election Day on Tuesday.
Both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.

Honda has been dealing with the airbag problem since 2008 Honda has added 437,700 cars, mainly in North America, to its existing global safety recall over airbag inflation problems. It broadens a recall announced in late 2008 for less than 4,000 Accord and Civic sedans, then expanded in mid-2009 to cover another 510,000 vehicles. The latest announcement also covers Japan, Mexico, Taiwan and Australia. The fresh blow to Japanese carmakers came as Toyota recalled nearly half a million hybrid cars over faulty brakes. Toyota has already had to bring millions of other vehicles back to dealerships amid accelerator and floormat problems. We cannot be completely certain the airbag inflator will perform as designed
Honda statement
Toyota in global recall of Prius Toyota fights back Mardell's America: Toyota's woes The scale of Toyota's recalls will be of particular interest to other car manufacturers, according to David Leggett, editor of the website Justauto.com. "Toyota have been keen to cut costs by increasingly using common parts in different models. If a part goes wrong in one model then other models will need to be recalled," he said. "I'm sure lots of other car manufacturers will be keeping a very close eye on what's happening with Toyota." Recalls within the car industry, however, are not uncommon. "They happen pretty regularly," said Jay Nagley, an industry analyst with Redspy Automotive. "At the moment they are in the news because of what's happening with Toyota, but if Honda had done its recall months ago no would have heard about it. "Everyone's looking for the next recall, but it's business as usual for carmakers despite what's in the news." Airbag inflator Honda - Japan's second-biggest carmaker - said the defective airbags can overinflate and burst, spraying potentially deadly metal shards. The carmaker said the inflators were at risk of rupturing, "resulting in metal fragments passing through the airbag cushion material and possibly causing injury or fatality to vehicle occupants". The fault has already been linked to 11 injuries and one fatality. Honda said in a statement: "We cannot be completely certain that the driver's airbag inflator in the vehicles being added to this recall at this time will perform as designed." Its shares fell in Japan after the announcement. The recall will apply to 2001 and 2002 model-year Accord, Civic, Odyssey, Pilot, CL, CR-V and 2002 Acura TL vehicles, the firm said. The company says owners should take their vehicle to an authorised dealer as soon as they receive notification from Honda. The carmaker's latest recall affects 378,000 cars in the US and 41,000 in Canada. It extends to 4,000 vehicles in Japan and 13,000 from other countries, including Mexico (9,000), Taiwan (1,300) and Australia (700). HONDA RECALLS Nov 2008: Airbag propellant problem reported in US. Recall of 4,200 cars June 2009: Similar airbag problem reported, recall widened to 508,000 cars mainly in US July 2009: Japan recalls 1,532 cars Feb 2010: 419,000 recalled in US and Canada; 17,000 in Japan and other countries The Japanese-only models are Inspire, Saber and Lagreat. Just last month, Honda had to recall 650,000 Fit hatchbacks worldwide to fix a switch defect that could cause a fire. It said the fault could allow water to enter the power window mechanism, making components overheat. The Fit is sold as the Jazz and City in other countries. That recall affects Asia, Latin America, Europe, South Africa and North America. For Toyota, the problems continued as a US Congressional committee cast doubts on its plans to fix accelerator problems. A memo to lawmakers cited "substantial evidence" of redesigned floormats failing to stop the pedals sticking. On Tuesday, Toyota recalled 436,000 hybrid vehicles worldwide, including its latest Prius, to fix brake faults. That comes on top of more than 8 million Toyotas recalled since last October for problems with slipping floormats and sticking accelerator pedals, linked to crashes that have killed at least 19 people. Toyota's UK centres begin repairing the accelerator pedals on 180,000 vehicles on Wednesday. They have the capacity to fix 6,000 cars a day, meaning it will be a month before the process is complete.

What do you do when you see another foreigner?
By James Winovich Jun 17, 2015 4 min read
If you've spent any amount of time living in Japan, you already know exactly what I'm talking about. But in case you're not familiar, or you call it something else, I am talking about The Gaijin Nod.
You're walking down the street, admiring the sakura while the sounds of your city provide a pleasant Japan soundscape. As you approach a traffic signal, you notice something. Maybe it's curly blonde hair, maybe it's a strange lack of a man purse, maybe it's just the person's height, but something tips you off that a possible fellow foreigner is coming your way.
You play it cool and continue walking, knowing that you're destined to cross paths in a few moments. As that moment draws near, you will lock eyes. At that point, you're automatically engaged in an uncomfortable game of chicken, never sure which side will make the first move. Eventually though, one of you will perform The Nod: the slightest bowing of the head, which is usually reciprocated in precisely the same manner, and then both of you will continue on your merry ways, happy to be past that awkward encounter.
What is that? Why do we do that? (And yes, I'm saying “we,” because I'm just as guilty as anyone.)
More specifically, why do we do that instead of actually saying hello? Does another foreigner in Japan make us feel slightly less special about being a foreigner in Japan? Is it a Fight Club situation, where we've all independently started to believe that the first rule of being a gaijin in Japan is never say hello to a fellow gaijin in Japan? Or is it like when you're leaving the adult section of TSUTAYA and someone else walks in, and your eyes meet and you have to scramble for a way out of the situation?
Are any of those the actual reason we do The Nod?
I guess in some ways The Nod makes sense; once you lock eyes with someone, doing nothing is usually the most weird/creepy option. But why do we escape to the cranial bow, the lowest form of greeting gestures?
Over the past few years, I've been trying to say “Hello” in cases where I would have previously given The Nod, with mixed results. I have no official data for my study, but the results were roughly as follows:
50% still responded with The Nod.
25% responded with “Hi!” or something similar.
20% didn't respond at all (and gave me the creeps).
5% responded with “Hi, James-sensei!” (← mistakenly did test during school twice)
Is The Nod necessarily a bad thing? Well, no, not necessarily. People do similar stuff all over the world to acknowledge someone without having to actually engage with them. In a lot of circumstances, it's a “knowing glance” that can help you and your fellow Nodder to feel more at home. But it's certainly not the best option to accomplish this goal.
In the end, it's totally up to you to decide how you respond when you see a fellow foreigner. You could continue nodding, but I'd recommend you try upgrading your nod from time to time. Throw in a “Hello!” and/or a smile every once in a while, and see what happens.
You could brighten another person's day, feel proud that you were slightly more human, and you might feel better yourself as well.
I know Japan has crazy/creepy/scary people; so does every other country in the world. You don't have to stop and have a conversation, but try to think of that shared “foreigner” title as something that puts you two on the same team. If you were a Yankees fan and you were watching a baseball game in Houston, and you saw another person wearing a Yankees cap, that's the kind of potential camaraderie you can imagine.
You could brighten another person's day, feel proud that you were slightly more human, and you might feel better yourself as well. The best possible case is that it's a hottie on the other end of your greeting, and he or she thinks you're just the cutest, and you hit it off.
Worst case, they think you're weird-looking or just odd for saying hello, and they rush past. Most of the time, it'll fall somewhere in the middle, where they either smile and say hello back to you, or just give you that classic Nod. That's a pretty good risk-reward balance in my book.
If you think I'm crazy, or you just want to stick by your tried and true Nodding ways, that's fine, too. I'm sure we'll pass each other on the street one day. We'll end up in each other's gaze because of that invisible force that always makes it happen.
And it'll be up to you: lean your head down 5 degrees and walk on by, or say “Hello!”
…and THEN walk on by?
Jared Fogle Beaten Up in Prison, Already Gained 30 Pounds — Report

“Jared is regularly taunted by those who have it out for him,” an insider told In Touch. “One of the men called Jared a ‘dirty child rapist' and told him to ‘get the f—k out' and not come back.” VIDEO: Jared Fogle's Recorded “Phone Sex” Tapes About Kids Are Appalling When the diet celeb tried to defend himself the “inmate slapped him across the cheeks several times and made his face red.” The sex offender then turned tail and ran out of the gym.

Russian spies were allegedly planning to interrupt signals on Wall Street and prompt a “meltdown flash crash” like what occurred in the financial sector in 2010. The FBI believes the Russian spy ring was going to destabilize the same high-frequency trading systems blamed for the 2010 Wall Street flash crash.
Suspected Russian spies came under FBI scrutiny in 2010 after 10 alleged intelligence agents were arrested in the United States. One of those arrested on spying charges was femme fatale Anna Chapman. All 10 of the individuals suspected of espionage were ultimately a part of a Cold War style prisoner swap with Russia.
Russian spy Anna Chapman.
As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Anna Chapman was recently “training” rebels in Urkaine. Vladimir Putin is reportedly using Chapman as a propaganda “weapon of mass destruction.” The Russia spy was featured on the cover of Maxim. Chapman was photographed on a Russian tank that was allegedly used in Ukraine by Moscow-backed rebel fighters. “It's almost 6 a.m. and 3,000 handsome men are still sleeping. I am very lucky to be at the heart of my motherland's army. It's a very special day for me,” The Russian spy said on Russian Ren TV.
During the 2010 Wall Street flash crash, fears that “robot” trading or automated trading were vulnerable to cyber hackers and terrorists were realized. The Dow Jones lost 1,000 points within minutes.
As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Igor Sporyshev was allegedly working with fellow accused Russian spy, Victor Podobnyy. The 27-year-old alleged was registered as a trade representative from the former Soviet Union and was reportedly tasked with recruiting women into their cause. Podobnyy left the United States on Monday, citing diplomatic immunity protections. Evgeny Buryakov, a third suspected Russian spy, was allegedly helping to plan a “Wall Street meltdown.” Federal prosecutors believe that Buryakov was attempting to recruit female American college students and women who worked in the financial sector.
Igor Sporyshev, who also left America under the cover of diplomatic immunity, was allegedly the handler of Evgeny Buryakov, 39. Buryakov is the only member of the alleged Russian spy ring still left in the United States. All three of the alleged Russian spies stand accused of attempting to garner information on high-frequency trading and Exchange Traded Funds – or shares bundles. The alleged Russian spy ring members also tried to get information regarding alternative energy sources currently under development in America and United States sanctions against Russia, the FBI maintains.

Dallas Stars General Manager Jim Nill announced today that the club has signed defenseman Ondrej Vala to a three-year entry-level contract.
Vala, 18, is currently playing his second season with the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He has skated in two games this season with the club, recording eight penalty minutes. During the 2015-16 season with the Blazers, he was the only team defensemen to skate in all 72 regular-season games and recorded 21 points (4-17=21), ranking third among club defensemen in both points (21) and assists (17). In seven postseason contests, he recorded one assist (0-1=1).
"Ondrej has shown a combination of size and physicality along with the ability to play a defensively responsible game at the junior hockey level," said Nill. "He was part of our team this year at the Traverse City Tournament and we look forward to his continued development playing for Don Hay and the coaching staff in Kamloops."
The 6-foot-4, 210-pound native of Kolin, Czech Republic has competed on the international level for the Czech Republic, skating in five games at the 2016 IIHF U18 World Championship in Grand Forks, N.D. He also represented his country at the 2015 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Cup, appearing in four games.
The timetable will start on October 20 and Ms Berejiklian said it represented the biggest timetable "rewrite" in a generation. NSW Transport Minister, Gladys Berejiklian: unveiled train revamp. Credit:Janie Barrett Leaked versions of the draft timetable published earlier this year by Fairfax Media showed smaller stations in the Blue Mountains, on the central coast and on the south coast would lose services under the new timetable as more trains ran on express patterns. The hub of Kogarah would also suffer significant service cuts. But Ms Berejiklian, releasing the timetable at Parramatta station with Sydney Trains chief executive Howard Collins, said most people would benefit overall. “The new timetable makes the best possible use of our infrastructure and rolling stock and will deliver more services, new express services and shorter travel times for many customers travelling longer distances,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“There are also improved stopping patterns to reduce congestion and more consistent departure times, meaning customers at busier stations won't need a timetable and platforms will be less crowded. "We know a lot of commuters are working longer hours, so service frequency for people heading out of the city has been extended later into the evening and similarly in the morning." But the timetable fails to match up with a number of election commitments. For instance, Ms Berejiklian promised six extra daily express services between the central coast and the city, including a service between the central coast and Macquarie University. This service is not in the new timetable. Ms Berejiklian also promised travel time savings of 15 minutes on express services between Campbelltown and Central compared to existing multi-stop services – the new timetable does not appear to include the 15-minute saving. At Tuesday's press conference, Ms Berejiklian would not answer questions directly on whether she had broken election promises. She said instead that she was very proud of the timetable and commuters across Sydney would benefit from it.
The minister's press release said there would be 145 extra services a week to and from Sydney Airport and increased connections to hubs including Parramatta (430 extra services a week), Strathfield (305), North Sydney (226), Hurstville (154), Epping (135), Macquarie Park (104), Chatswood (96), Bankstown (63) and Penrith (34). In general, the timetable attempts to introduce more express services for commuters from outer suburbs and more regular and predictable stopping patterns. But this means significant changes for commuters at a number of smaller stations and some larger stations. Kogarah Station, near St George Hospital and a number of high schools, is a big loser. Commuters from Sutherland, Waterfall and Cronulla will no longer be able to travel on direct trains to Kogarah. They will have to change at Hurstville, whence there will be a train every 10 minutes to Kogarah. Loading

This story is the first in a series on what political strategists say each of the main political parties needs to do to win the election. Today, it's the NDP; tomorrow, it will be the Liberals; and the day after that, the Conservatives.
Tom Mulcair and the NDP went into the 2015 election campaign in an enviable position -- top of the polls and with momentum to boot.
But 11 weeks is an eternity in any political contest, and the epic length of this one has clearly not benefited the NDP, who are now polling third.
"The dominant story right now is the NDP is in serious trouble," says Claude Denis, a political science professor at the University of Ottawa.
The party, he says, has lost "a significant portion of its Quebec gains, as well as its general momentum across the country that was built at least in good part on the perception that they were strong in Quebec."
In an attempt to reverse the party's fortunes, strategists and polling experts say the New Democrats are likely to hit hard on issues such as the recently signed Trans-Pacific Partnership, try to turn the Conservatives' emphasis on the niqab to their advantage and continue to make the argument to fence-sitting progressive voters that they are the party best positioned to unseat Stephen Harper.
That said, Mulcair's task in this last week or so of campaigning is "herculean," says Elly Alboim, a political consultant and the lead strategist at Earnscliffe Strategy Group in Ottawa.
Reversing the 'Orange crash'
According to CBC's Poll Tracker, when the campaign started on Aug. 2, the NDP was polling at 33.2 per cent support nationally. And as of Oct. 7, they're at 24.3 per cent.
One of the reasons for that decline is that the party is perceived as being on the wrong side of the niqab debate in Quebec where both the Conservatives and Bloc Quebecois have been stoking nativist sentiment.
The question of whether a Muslim woman should be allowed to wear a veil that covers her face while taking the oath of citizenship has emerged as an unexpected campaign issue.
In office, the Conservatives attempted to forbid that circumstance, but a Federal Court judge overruled them and the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decision.
Still, a poll commissioned by the government and conducted by Leger Marketing in the spring found that 93 percent of Quebecers agree with a ban on the niqab in this situation, and defending the religious freedom of Muslim women has been a risky proposition for the NDP, who took 59 of the province's 75 ridings in 2011.
Eric Grenier, founder of the Canadian polling data site ThreeHundredEight, says Mulcair "can't change his position," but he and the party will likely try to change the conversation in order to salvage support in Quebec.
Mulcair has been trying to do that in recent days by suggesting that the niqab ban is part of the Conservatives' attempt to sow racial division and divert attention from the government's record on the economy.
Mulcair "has to convince Quebecers that [the niqab] is not the issue, the issue is defeating the Conservatives," says Grenier. He has to convince them that he is the one who can do that and provide the kind of government that they want.
As Grenier sees it, only if the NDP can correct its course in Quebec will it regain the momentum it needs to come out ahead on Oct. 19.
What's the strategy on strategic voting?
Another problem the NDP faces is that one of the main themes of the campaign is that there are a large number of left and centre-left voters who are so unhappy with the current government that they are willing to swap their vote for the candidate best positioned to unseat Harper.
"The number of people who say they are willing to consider switching their vote at the moment is probably at a historic high, and it's clustered largely among NDP and Liberal voters," says Alboim.
At the beginning of the campaign, with the polls behind him, Mulcair was the "default change agent," says Alboim.
But with the Liberals rising in the polls, many strategic voters are beginning to feel that Mulcair no longer represents the best chance for change.
No doubt sensing this, the NDP have been making the mathematical argument that if they add 30 or so new seats to the 103 they won in 2011, they are best positioned to defeat Harper, says Alice Funke, publisher of PunditsGuide.ca, a site that analyzes data on ridings.
But that argument is based on two assumptions: that the party will hold the seats it won last time, and that it can wrest more from the Liberals, who have been on the rise in Ontario in particular.
The University of Ottawa's Denis says that the NDP has run a competent if overly safe campaign thus far, but the party needs to be bolder to distinguish itself from the Liberals.
He thinks Mulcair may have found that issue with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the wide-ranging free trade deal that is said to open Canadian markets to foreign products and vice-versa.
Exploiting divisions on TPP
The Conservatives have argued that the deal is a winner for the Canadian economy. The Liberals have criticized the lack of transparency in the negotiations, but have not really taken issue with the substance of the deal, most of which is still unknown.
The NDP, however, has heavily criticized it, saying the concessions on auto parts and the dairy industry will cost tens of thousands of Canadian jobs.
"The reason that [Mulcair] has seized on the TPP with such alacrity is because it's literally the only wedge issue he has with Trudeau that has any meaning," says Alboim.
He feels the NDP's attack on the TPP is likely to play well in ridings with agricultural and manufacturing centres and heavy union support.
This would include Quebec, where the dairy industry is entrenched, as well as the Windsor area, parts of the rural Prairies and B.C., where there is a higher base vote for the NDP than the Liberals.
Alboim says that to turn the issue to its advantage, the NDP is going to have "to work, particularly with union support, to identify enough ridings in enough places where they're No. 2 to cash in — plus try to build a bit on the anti-trade movement in the country."
Tesco to sell half-price Viagra over the counter
Tesco is to start selling Viagra over the counter at half price.
The pills were only available on prescription – or from dubious internet sources – until Boots began selling direct to customers last year, at £55 for four.
But Tesco will offer fierce competition by selling Viagra at £52 for eight of the blue tablets.
Pick up with the weekly shop: Customers will be able to buy Viagra when they visit Tesco
It is the first supermarket to start selling the anti-impotence drug.
From next Monday, Viagra will be available at 300 Tesco in-store pharmacies across the country.
Following similar rules to those operated for over-the-counter sales of the drug in Boots, customers will simply be able to put a packet in their shopping basket and go through a till.
Pop in for some Viagra: Customers will be able to put the anti-impotence drug in their shopping basket
Tesco pharmacists have already been trained to help the men potentially eligible, aged 40 to 65, to complete a questionnaire and undergo blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol tests.
If these tests show they are suitable, the men will be offered the pills.
Pugh cartoon of Viagra in Tesco
Those with abnormal glucose, cholesterol or blood pressure may be refused the drug and referred back to their GPs.
Yesterday Shona Scott, Tesco's commercial manager for pharmacy services, said: ‘Tesco's will be the cheapest service in the country for those who don't have a private prescription from their GP. At the moment only Boots offer a similar service – for which they charge £55 for just four tablets.'
A Tesco source said a special training course had prepared pharmacists for different
types of customers.
‘One scenario saw an older man who was very nervous and couldn't get his words out,' the source said.
Others involved a man coming in and sitting down confidently and discussing his problem openly using slang terms.
When Boots first began testing over-the-counter sales a year ago, hundreds of men travelled many miles to buy Viagra.
It is thought that many were simply too embarrassed to ask their doctor for a prescription.
More than a dozen Marin bayside sites from Sausalito to Novato could get funding to gird against sea-level rise in the coming years due to Bay Area voters' recent approval of a $12 annual parcel tax.
But word won't come until January 2018 as officials with the state-created San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority work for the rest of 2016 and 2017 to set up the system to deliver projects in Marin and other counties.
Among the Marin areas that could receive restoration money: Bahia wetlands in Novato, Simmons Slough seasonal wetlands in Novato, Novato Creek Baylands, Bel Marin Keys, Lower Gallinas Creek, Lower Miller Creek/McInnis marsh, Tiscornia marsh in San Rafael, Lower Corte Madera Creek, Madera Bay Park, Aramburu Island in Strawberry, Bothin Marsh in Mill Valley, Richardson Bay, Sausalito Eelgrass Preserve, as well as creek-to-bay trash reduction projects.
“The projects will likely be updated,” said Caitlin Sweeney, director of San Francisco Estuary Partnership and staff member at the new restoration authority. “The measure does specify a certain amount of projects for each county over time.”
Nona Dennis, an official with the Marin Conservation League, said she was excited about the prospects in Marin and throughout the Bay Area.
“We want our share of the funds, of course, but it's good to see the entire region involved,” she said.
The tax measure approved by voters June 7 will raise $500 million over 20 years to finance work to reduce the impact of sea-level rise, with a goal of 100,000 acres of wetlands restoration. While the actual need is close to $2 billion, restoration backers believe they can use the local tax dollars to leverage additional state and federal grants.
The restoration authority will appoint a financial oversight committee, as the measure requires, and review plans in the coming months and in early 2017. The tax will show up on property tax bills next July, the same month the agency will request proposals for the environmental work. Then in January 2018, projects will start to be funded.
Marin voters gave 73.5 percent approval, outpacing the 70.32 percent Bay Area-wide vote. The measure needed a combined 66.67 percent in all nine Bay Area counties.
A precinct-by-precinct analysis by the California Coastal Conservancy found that, in most cases, the closer a voter lived to the bay's shoreline the more likely he or she was to vote for Measure AA, and the farther away he or she lived the less likely.
The analysis showed that Marin, San Francisco, Oakland, Peninsula shoreline communities, San Jose and large parts of the Contra Costa shoreline population all supported Measure AA by more than two-thirds.
In inland areas such as northern Napa and Sonoma counties, eastern Contra Costa and most southern Santa Clara County, a majority voted no.
The highest support came in San Francisco County, with 77.6 percent, followed by Alameda, 75.2 percent; then Marin; San Mateo, 72 percent; and Santa Clara, 70.1 percent. Surprising many political experts, Contra Costa County voters approved of the measure by 65.7 percent. Less support came from Sonoma County, 64.3 percent; Napa County, 59.1 percent; and Solano County, 54.3 percent.
The analysis showed Democrats cast 61 percent of the ballots, and Republicans 18 percent, with decline-to-state voters at 18 percent. “The fact that the entire Bay Area passed it is remarkable,” Dennis said. “It shows a region-wide understanding of the importance of the issue.”
The Bay Area News Group contributed to this report.
The FBI told a federal court it needed a search warrant to look at thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails on the laptop of former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner because they had the potential to cause “grave damage to national security” if disclosed, according to court documents made public Tuesday.
The wording was contained in a redacted search warrant and other court papers that were previously under seal in the investigation of an online relationship between Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, and a teenage girl in North Carolina. The papers offered no new revelations about Clinton's emails or the scope of a case that factored into the presidential election.
A sworn statement dated Oct. 30 from an FBI agent whose name was blacked out cited a previous inquiry into Clinton's personal computer server that found 22 emails classified “Top Secret.” The classification “is significant because it means that the unauthorized disclosure of those emails could result in exceptionally grave damage to national security,” the agent wrote.
In the Weiner probe, the FBI discovered header information on emails pointing to correspondence to and from Clinton, the papers say. Given the findings of the earlier probe, “there is also probable cause to believe that the correspondence … contains classified information which was produced by and is owned by the U.S. government,” they say.
U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel ruled Monday that the public had a right to see the search warrant application and supporting court paperwork, but he said portions would be blacked out to protect the identity of the investigating agents. The judge also ordered the redaction of sections of the paperwork related to the ongoing investigation into Weiner's online correspondence.
The discovery of the emails on the disgraced New York congressman's laptop prompted FBI Director James Comey to briefly reopen an investigation that he had closed over the summer into Clinton's use of the private server to handle emails she sent and received as secretary of state.
After getting court consent to delve into the newly discovered emails on Oct. 30, agents spent several days analyzing them before Comey announced that they contained no new evidence of any wrongdoing by Clinton.
In statement, E. Randol Schoenberg, a Los Angeles lawyer who had sued to obtain the court papers, said Tuesday that he saw “nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause, nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime, nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Secretary Clinton and her longtime aide Huma Abedin.”

The Boulder Fire Department responded Thursday to an overturned concrete pumper truck — which was in danger of falling into Boulder Creek behind the University of Colorado — after seeing it on the news.
The truck was on campus for work on the $156 million CU stadium expansion project when it tipped over at about 1:30 p.m.
Boulder police and fire spokeswoman Kim Kobel said no one at the construction site alerted the fire department to the overturned truck.
Members of a nearby fire crew became curious when they saw a news helicopter flying over the stadium.
"So they called one of their other stations to ask what was going on," Kobel said. "That station happened to have seen this on the news. They contacted the battalion chief, and the battalion chief asked a nearby station crew to come over here and investigate and to see if we were needed.
"It turned out that was a good idea."
CU spokesman Bronson Hilliard said the university plans to look into why no one at the construction site called the police or fire department.
"It does appear that indeed the fire department responded on its own," he said. "We're certainly going to have to look into that as we debrief on the incident and try to figure out where the breakdown in communication was as to why the fire department wasn't called."

No one was inside the truck at the time of the accident, Hilliard and Kobel confirmed. Hilliard said the ground beneath the truck was wet.
"Basically, it's a heavy truck on wet ground, and the ground just gave way and the truck tipped over on its side," he said.
Two excavators helped prop up the concrete pumper truck and prevent it from tumbling into Boulder Creek. A hazardous materials team responded to the site because of concerns about the possibility of fluids from the truck leaking into the creek.
Construction crews had to cut the 34-meter boom pump from the truck because it was caught in trees and bushes, according to Kobel.
By 8 p.m., crews had turned the truck upright, Hilliard said, after first clamping off all areas where fluids could have leaked out.
As a precaution, crews put absorbent materials on the hillside and "oil booms" across the creek in case any petroleum leaked into the water, Hilliard said.
He said there was no early evidence of any fluid leakage into the creek.
"It's a precaution to make sure (the fluids don't) get into the creek," he said.
Mortenson Construction is leading the expansion and renovation efforts at Folsom Field, but Hilliard said he wasn't sure who was responsible for the concrete pumper truck.
This isn't the CU stadium expansion project's first mishap. In July, neighbors complained about losing sleep after crews worked through the night for several days in a row.

A potential $1 billion federal government loan to Indian conglomerate Adani for its proposed coal mine has been called into question because comments by the company appear to conflict with infrastructure funding guidelines.
Public finance for Australia's biggest open-cut coal pit has become the latest political battleground, as alarming new footage emerged of the environmental damage done to wetlands bordering Adani's Abbot Point coal terminal in Queensland by cyclone Debbie.
Research by the independent Parliamentary Library, passed to Fairfax Media, found statements by Adani on the financial viability of the Carmichael project in Queensland's Galilee Basin could render it ineligible to accept funding for a mine-to-port rail line from the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund.
In December, Adani spokesman Ron Watson confidently declared that access to the $1 billion concessional loan through the infrastructure fund was "not make or break" for the $16 billion project moving to production. "It's not critical," Mr Watson said of the loan at the time.
It pisses people off when the War on Drugs is brought up.
They give you dirty looks; feeling that pointing out that the Warf on Drugs seems to have become nothing more than an excuse for local law enforcement to dress up in Commando gear and abuse the rights of citizens is no different than handing their kid a joint and a freshly chalked up line of fine Peruvian flake and telling them to go for it.
But videos like this make the case for me better than any statistic or logical argument ever could.
This is a video- taken by the Tucson SWAT team- showed the SWAT team storming the home of Jose Guerena Ortiz in May of 2011 because of his
suspected involvement in drug trafficking. The evidence against him amounted to an anonymous tip, some unsavory friends, and one prior weapons charge (I'm sure his being Hispanic didn't hurt either…). The county prosecutor's office says the shooting was justified. The case has since led to no arrests (or further investigations apparently).
Cops were serving a “No Knock” warrant, which gives the right to storm the premises- for lack of a better term- in order to get their collar. This is usually reserved for the worst of the worst… men that the Fuzz needs to get off the streets as quickly as possible in order to keep the Straights safe.
According to the account of Vanessa Guerena (the victim's wife who was hiding in the closet with their four year old pajama clad son at the time of the raid), her husband- a veteran of the Iraqi War- pulled the gun because he thought he needed to defend his home from masked men dressed in black (something I am sure is a real concern that close to the drug war ravaged borderlands he was not living too far from).
Tragically, the Men in Black this time happened to be the cops.
Check it out as these cops unload 77 rounds at this guy (22 of them finding their target) in this raid gone horribly wrong…
Fuck the Police, Fuck the Police, Fuck ‘em…
Shit like this is where the flaws in the War on Drugs show up crystal clear.
Of all the ways to snare this guy… at his job in the copper mine… at the gym… as part of a routine traffic stop… A “No Knock” warrant for a non-violent offender…
This isn't about doing police work or protecting and serving the public if you ask me...
This is nothing more than a show of force, plain and simple, with the pig SWAT guys making sure that they are sending a message to their community that Big Brother doesn't fuck around when it comes to drugs.
Because no one likes it when you fuck with the money...
And in these hard fiscal times, the War on Drugs is seen by many Americans as fucking with the money (money, I might add, we don't have and are going to be borrowing from China)… Money that could be better spent on more useful things... Like Health Care or Social Security or something… as opposed to this needless campaign to stomp out something that seems to only get more and more popular as the years progress.
But what do I know…
I'm just another oh so dangerous pothead.

Garland County Circuit Judge Wade Naramore enters the courtroom with his wife, Ashley, before his trial begins Monday, Aug. 15, 2016. - Photo by Brandon Riddle
6:20 P.M. UPDATE:
HOT SPRINGS — A jury of six women and six men has been seated in the trial of Circuit Judge Wade Naramore, who is charged in his toddler son's hot-car death last year.
The 12-member jury, plus one alternate, was selected after a process that began at 8:30 a.m. and continued until shortly before 6 p.m. Monday, the first day of Naramore's trial before Judge John Langston in Garland County Circuit Court.
Through questioning from defense and prosecuting attorneys, about 15 potential jurors were excused, many telling the court that they had already formed an opinion in the case.
One of the male candidates, echoing similar sentiment among other potential jurors excused, said he could listen to testimony from both sides but would largely side with a verdict of guilty.
That juror, who works with children, said it would be hard to change his mind based on his view of the difficulty of forgetting a child in a vehicle.
He added that it would not be easy for him to see photographic evidence of the child's death given his “soft heart.”
Naramore's 18-month-old son, Thomas Naramore, died after being left in a hot vehicle for hours in Hot Springs in July 2015.
Others, meanwhile, said that while they felt sympathy for Naramore and his family, they could be impartial in the case, making a decision based solely on the evidence presented.
Juror candidates were asked about their views on accuracy in the news media — a line of questioning that addressed what has become a high-profile case and attempted to eliminate potential jurors who might have read or watched stories on the Naramore case.
On several occasions Monday, Naramore embraced his wife, Ashley, who has been by his side throughout pretrial hearings leading up to the start of his trial.
Naramore at times also placed his hands on a small book lying directly in front of him at the defense table.
Court adjourned shortly after the jury process ended Monday evening. The second day of Naramore's trial, which is set to include opening statements, will begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday.
Read Tuesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details.
3:45 P.M. UPDATE:
HOT SPRINGS — Attorneys for Garland County Circuit Judge Wade Naramore and the state continued to narrow down the field of potential jurors Monday afternoon.
By around 3:40 p.m., nine had been excused from Naramore's negligent-homicide trial. At that time, two replacements were being questioned on their impartiality.

EARLIER:
HOT SPRINGS — Jury selection has begun in the trial of Garland County Circuit Judge Wade Naramore, who faces a charge of negligent homicide in the hot-car death of his 18-month-old son last summer.
Before a lunch break, two potential jurors had been replaced from the pool of more than 50 people — one because of a medical condition and another citing concerns over impartiality, particularly given a relative's work history with Naramore as well as her positive perception of the judge.
As many as 180 people were initially expected to be called as potential jurors, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette previously reported.
At least five of the potential jurors knew of Naramore in some form, including one who said that while he could be impartial, the news media had been biased in its reporting.
That juror, who goes to church with the judge, reiterated later to prosecuting attorney Tom Young that Naramore had been “hung out to dry by the media.”
Once court resumes at 1 p.m., the defense is set to question that juror as well as the 17 others remaining in the first pool.
Naramore's toddler son, Thomas Naramore, was found unresponsive in a vehicle July 24, 2015, in Hot Springs on a day when temperatures reached the upper 90s, with heat indexes of around 105 degrees.
Naramore was arrested in February after a special prosecutor opted to charge him in the case. He hasn't presided over any cases since his son's death and was placed on suspension with pay after his arrest. Special judges have been filling in.
If convicted of negligent homicide, a class A misdemeanor, Naramore could face up to one year in county jail and a $2,500 fine.
Once jurors are seated, jury instructions and opening statements will begin in Naramore's five-day trial.
At the start of the trial Monday, retired Judge John Langston ruled in Garland County Circuit Court that charges not be dismissed after missing video evidence came to light.

If you are a member of one of our great local fire departments, I hope you can help out this young man. All his life he wanted to become a firefighter, but cancer has got in the way.
According to WROC in Rochester NY , 21-year-old Johnathan Davis has an inoperable brain tumor and one request. He wants a fire department patch from every department in New York State.
At first, the idea may have seemed unrealistic, but Johnathan's mother happened to run into Rochester Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy and through social media, the word spread. Now as he fights for his life, Johnathan's dream may soon become a reality.
"He's always been my hero from the moment this all started. I couldn't be more proud of him," said Laurie Davis.
It's a lofty goal and I'm sure he will get there. We encourage anybody that happens to see this to contact their neighboring departments and their own departments certainly and send patches to Johnathan.

The wonderful thing about Supernatural is that it attracts the kind of writer that has this vast love for genre and horror. People that come in to interview for this job who have this encyclopedia knowledge. We just sit and chew the shit for an hour about this sort of thing. It's sort of like having coffee with geeky friends. – Sera Gamble, Comic Con 2011, Source
This section has entries for all the people who have had a writing credit on Supernatural. The Writer and Director Episode Guide lists each episode by director and writer.
The Supernatural writing team and post-production is based in LA while the show (except for 1.01 Pilot) is filmed in Vancouver.
Following a large roster of writers in season one (of which most were "freelancers"), Supernatural has had a core group of around eight writers each season. Writing on a TV show is not a solo effort -- story arcs and individual episodes will be developed and broken in collaboration with the writers' room. Eric Kripke, Bob Singer and Sera Gamble in particular have had a much greater input and influence on the scripts than their individual writing credits indicate. In addition story editors and writers assistants have input at different parts of the scripts development. Some writers assistants have gained writing credits on the show including Emily McLaughlin, Jenny Klein, Jackson Stewart and John Bring. Stunt coordinator Lou Bollo has also received a "story by" credit for two episodes.
Jared and Jensen visit the writers in LA in Season 12
It is normal practice for TV writers and directors to be given a producer or executive producer credit as they become more senior in the production team, although not all of these will actually take on roles more broadly involved in the show's production. Robert Singer, who has been co-showrunner (executive producer) since the beginning only has three episode writing credits, although he has input on all scripts. He stepped back from the executive producer role to consulting producer in season eleven, while still remaining one of the show's regular directors. With season twelve, Singer once again returned to the role as co-showrunner alongside Andrew Dabb.
Some regular writers who have moved on from Supernatural include:
Supernatural's meta commentary on writers took the form of Chuck Shurley who we meet in 4.18 The Monster at the End of This Book. His name Carver Edlund was a portmanteau of Jeremy Carver and Ben Edlund. (In the same episode writers Sera Gamble and Julie Siege appear in the form of the Publisher who was called Sera Seige in the script Source). Chuck is an author who wrote the Supernatural book series, and continued to write even though the books were no longer being published. Unbeknownst to him, the inspiration of the books was divine - as he is a prophet of God. At the end of season five, it is suggested that Chuck may in fact be God.
The metaphor is of the writer as creator. The character is an avatar for Kripke himself (Source) and is used to comment on the text and process of writing with reference to specific past episodes of the show. This metaphor would also hold then that God, the creator, was also the writer. We have a trinity here - Chuck, Kripke and God.
In 6.15 The French Mistake, Sera Gamble was portrayed as the new showrunner no-one would listen to, Bob Singer was the world weary producer/director and Eric Kripke was hoping to hit the big time with his new script Octacobra.

Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Chekhov… someone could design a personality test around which great 19th century Russian writers turned readers on to that most brooding and intense of national literatures. For me it was first Dostoevsky, with an obligatory high school reading of Crime and Punishment, whose ending I hated so much that I had to go on and read The Idiot, The Possessed, Notes From the Underground, and nearly everything else to find out what went wrong. And the mischievous fantasist Gogol I preferred even to Kafka as a young reader, so I'd probably score high on existential angst and absurdist tendencies on whatever we're calling our literary Meyers-Briggs.
But we would have to include the 20th century successors: Solzhenitsyn, Bulgakov, Pasternak. The dissenters and exposers of Soviet cruelty and corruption who took on the traditions of stark, brutal realism and darkly comic allegory. All of these are traditions that literary gadabout Stephen Fry rightly points out “changed the literature, and particularly the literature of the novel, the world over.” Yet somehow, after the fall of the Soviet Union, it's a literature we seemed to stop hearing about. However, “just because we stopped reading,” says Fry as host of the documentary above, Russia's Open Book: Writing in the Age of Putin, “doesn't mean the Russians stopped writing.” Produced by Intelligent Television and Wilton films and premiering online today (and on PBS on December 28), the film profiles six new Russian writers most of us haven't read, but should.
Perhaps a particularly iconic figure for the Putin age, we first meet the controversial and somewhat macho novelist Zakhar Prilepin, whose nostalgia for the Soviet past has earned him the ire of liberals. Prilepin freely admits that his happy, “wonderful,” childhood explains his sympathy for the Soviet state. Despite these warm psychological origins, literary critic Alexander Gavrilov calls Prilepin's first novel, 2005's Pathologies, “an aggressive terrorist attack of a book,” for its harsh portrayal of the war in Chechnya. The book draws on Prilepin's experiences as a veteran of two Chechen wars. His second novel, Sankya was shortlisted for the Russian Booker and National Bookseller prizes in 2006, and yet aside from a few short stories, Prilepin's work has yet to be translated into English.
What has fascinated Westerners about Russia in the past is in part its deep veneration for its writers. In every age—Golden, Silver, or blood red—Russian writers held places of cultural prominence, or infamy. Lenin was a great writer of history and polemic. Even Putin soft-pedals his backing for the Syrian regime in a genteel open letter. To be a recognized writer in Russia means being a celebrity, or as Prilepin says, it's "a kind of show business.” Russia's Open Book narrator Juliet Stephenson quotes poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko: “In Russia, a poet is more than a poet.”
And then we meet contemporary Russian “activist, journalist, teacher, novelist, critic, and poet” Dmitry Bykov, a dead ringer for an earlier vintage of Saturday Night Live's Horatio Sanz. His genial appearance hides deeply serious intent. A romantic inspired by the vibrancy of Russia's political fight for “the dignity of all its citizens,” Bykov tells us “Before I went to the first protest, I'd stopped writing. Afterwards, I wrote a whole volume of lyric poetry. No politics, it's all roses and rhymes.” Bykov's 2006 Living Souls—which does exist, abridged, in English—takes up the great Russian tradition of the political fable. Other writers, like the boldly outspoken novelist (and former geneticist) Ludmila Ulitskaya, are much more ambivalent about political engagement. “But in some situations,” says Ulitskaya, “you can't remain silent….”
It's difficult perhaps for Westerners to appreciate the contemporary situations of these new Russian writers, given how little we seem to understand Russia's internal political state (and given the relative absence of a viable U.S. foreign press service). After all, it's no longer an existential necessity that we know our sworn enemy, as in the Cold War, nor is Russia treated any longer as Europe's distinguished first cousin, as in its Imperial 19th century past. But the writers profiled in Russia's Open Book make us keenly aware that the country's literary culture is thriving, and deserving of our attention. To learn more about the makers of the film and the six contemporary writers profiled, visit the Russia's Open Book website. And to expand your appreciation for Russian literature in general, spend some time at the Read Russia 2013 site here, a new initiative “to celebrate Russian literature and Russian book culture.” We also have many Russian classics in our Free eBooks and Audio Books collections.
Russia's Open Book: Writing in the Age of Putin will be permanently listed in our collection of 600 Free Movies Online.

Jewcy loves trees! Please don't print!
We get a lot of interesting e-mails at Jewcy–from Nazis threatening us to Jews for Jesus trying to convert us–but getting e-mails asking us if we'd like to interview Justin Bieber's Jewish manager, Scooter Braun, takes the cake.
We weren't sure why we were solicited until we remembered that Bieber has a movie coming out, and that maybe they wanted to cover all the bases, including the Jewish ones.
We were given the two options of either interviewing Mr. Scooter, or using a pre-written essay about him. Here is what we learned from that essay:
1. Scooter is a 29-year-old “father figure” to Justin Bieber.
2. Scooter discovered Justin while watching videos on Youtube. That is like finding a pot of gold in ten tons of horse doo-doo.
3. Scooter's grandparents are holocaust survivors.
4. The essay quotes both the Talmud and Rudyard Kipling.
We're sure Scooter is a nice guy and has tons of intelligent things to say in an interview, but we decided to go with the pre-written essay that you can read totally unedited, below. (Thanks to VJ Life for sending this to us)
Fairy Tale or Imminent Doom: Justin Bieber and His Very Jewish Manager
What do you get when you mix Hard Days Night, Thriller, Youtube and Temple Beth Shalom?
Scooter Braun.
Whatever Scooter Braun would have done in life, he would have been a proud, active, committed Jew. Today, at age 29, Mr. Braun is a major force in the entertainment industry and the man who both discovered, and manages, teen mega-star Justin Bieber. In case you have missed the virtually unprecedented rise of Justin Beiber, the story goes something like this: In 2008, Mr. Braun came across some amateur music videos on youtube featuring a fourteen year-old singer named Justin Bieber. It was clear to Scooter that the kid had talent, great talent. Scooter Braun forged a close relationship with Bieber and his mother, became his manager, and within two years nearly half the girls on the planet had a crush on Justin. Today, Justin Bieber is the most searched for celebrity on the internet, just one of his youtube music videos has had over 400 million views and Never Say Never, a film about his 2010 concert tour will be released on February 11th.
Recently, I attended a pre-release screening of Never Say Never. I was expecting a trite, cliché, teeny-bopper movie—not exactly my kind of film—and I left with two impressions. First, I was pleasantly surprised and saw how some people could even be inspired by it's message of never say never to your dreams. At the same time, the film was quite troubling. As a parent, what I saw was a manager, Scooter Braun, Justin's mother, and a hand full of others who were at worst exploiting a helpless child, and at best naively feeding a sixteen-year-old kid to the wolves. Let's be honest, we've seen stories like this before, and it's not hard to envision a brutal ending captured in articles beginning with words like, “Justin Bieber, former teen idol, overdoses during yet another relapse …” or, “Once the heartthrob of millions of girls, Justin Bieber and his third wife recently separated after just four months of marriage …” or, “Scooter Braun, former manager and father figure to Justin Bieber, is accused of hiding millions in revenue due to Mr. Bieber and his mother …”
And so, in a recent conversation with Scooter Braun, there was one issue that was upper most in my mind: I wanted to know how Scooter Braun, as a virtual father figure and perhaps the most influential person in this kids life, could not be blinded by what Justin represents professionally and financially. More importantly, what he is doing to make sure that Justin Bieber, who was an innocent thirteen-year-old when the two first met, doesn't become the next Lindsey Lohan, Corey Haim or Michael Jackson?”
I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by what Scooter (or Shmuel ben Eliezer as he introduced himself to me), had to say. “Look,” Scooter said, “while this is a very complicated matter that I take very seriously, in many ways it comes down to this; with 20,000 people a night telling you that you are the greatest thing on earth, you better be very clear that there is something far more significant above you. Without that awareness, there is no chance of staying grounded.” Having said that, Scooter pointed out something that appears at the end of the film that I didn't catch. At every concert, just before going on stage, Justin, his mom Pattie who is born again Christian, and a close circle of friends join together in prayer. And what about Scooter the Jew? Well, he taught this inner circle the Shema, which is how every prayer circle concludes.
Scooter Braun was raised in a kosher home, two of his grandparents survived Auschwitz and Dachau and he spent summers at Camp Ramah including a six-week trip to Israel. Jewish life and Jewish values are very important to Scooter and clearly not something that he keeps in the background. He grew up in a close knit Jewish family and this foundation of the importance and centrality of family is what he says is front-and- center in his relationship to Justin. After discovering Bieber, Scooter's mom told him that this was not just another client and that he was taking responsibility for the life of a young person. He seems to have taken those words to heart. In Braun's words, “It's about the relationship.” He told Justin that he would never leave him and that this is a relationship for life, whether success and stardom are there or not. Rule number one, Scooter says, is that there can't be anyone working on Justin's team who doesn't have a good heart. As an example, Justin's bodyguard Kenny Hamilton and Scooter were friends for nine years before they started working together. Scooter knew whoever was guarding Justin would be around him all the time and he wanted a person whose quality of character he deeply trusted. Justin Bieber has a very close relationship with his mother and a good relationship with his dad. Scooter is in regular conversation with them about the gamut of parenting issues—school, friends, adolesence, setting limits, religion, and all the rest. While many performing artists have backed out of concerts in Israel, on April 14th, for better or worse, Bieber fever will hit Tel Aviv, and a few days later, just to keep things in perspective, Scooter and Justin will sit down to a long evening that will begin with the words, “Why is this night different from all other nights?”
The Talmud says that as difficult as poverty is, wealth is actually a greater test. Justin Bieber, and along with him, his mom and Scooter Braun, are well on their way to great wealth, enormous fame, and substantial cultural clout. A very heady mix and a mighty test indeed. Scooter Braun seems to understand that to come out on top in the ways that truly count, he will need to remain forever rooted in the bedrock of his religious heritage, and to never lose sight of the Rudyard Kipling poem If, that holds a special place in his heart.
If you can dream, and not make dreams your master … If you can walk with crowds and keep your virtue, Or walk with kings—nor lose your common touch … If all men count with you, but none too much …
Yours is the earth and everything that's in it, And—which is more—you'll be a man my son.
When playing Two Truths and a Lie, you typically tell three facts about yourself, and the other people have to guess which two are true, and which is the lie.
When Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams recently played it with Yahoo, instead of offering up facts about themselves, they told three Game of Thrones, season six spoilers each.
Before you proceed, be warned that out of the following six spoilers, four are genuine (we just don't know which). If you'd rather not even have an inkling of things to come, then stop reading now.
Okay. Sophie revealed:
“1. Ramsay dies. 2. Lady Stoneheart returns. 3. Arya checks three people off her list.”
And Maisie?
“1. Arya goes to Westeros, back over the sea. 2. Arya is in the trailer more times than people have realised, because they don't realise it's her. 3. Arya doesn't cross any more names off her list.”
Lady Stoneheart (in case you haven't read the books) is Catelyn Stark, resurrected.
We can't help but think that Arya will be heading back to Westeros at some point (she's been in Braavos for long enough now), and that she will tick more names of her list.
This would suggest that she's also in the trailer more than we think, maybe in disguise?
As far as Sophie's revelations go, we're stumped. Will Ramsay die? Will Catelyn come back? Or will Arya go on a killing spree?
Only time will tell…
A Halifax man came home to an unexpected surprise after being away for the Labour Day long weekend.
He arrived home to shards of glass scattered across his bedroom floor from a broken window he hadn't been alerted to.
“I came home and found this work being done – the siding being removed, scaffolding up around the windows – and I hadn't heard a peep from the new owner,” Peter Fillmore, a south-end resident, said.
Fillmore's been renting a flat out of a historic Young Avenue mansion for 10 years.
He says while many people assume the area is extremely expensive to rent in and that the mansions are single-family dwellings, many of the homes actually have multiple apartment units within them.
“Many people think that the rents are very high here but they're not, they're quite modest and I consider what I have here to be a bargain,” Fillmore said.
The home he rents out of is known as the Fram House. It's one of several mansions along Young Avenue, a destination street known as Halifax's grand boulevard.

It's an area where many believe its sense of character is being jeopardized developers who are buying the homes and tearing them down to develop multiple, high-income properties on the massive old lots.
“We've had so much demolition on this street already this year – this is the fourth house that we're losing and you know these are wonderful old, historic homes,” said Peggy Cunnigham, a Young Avenue resident and member of Save Young Avenue, a concerned citizens group.
The Fram House was recently purchased by Dino Capital Limited. It's the same developer that bought and demolished a large home known as the Cleveland Estate that used to be next door to the Fram House.
The closing date on the Fram House purchase was moved from late November to the end of this past August. Immediately following the close, demolition of the property began even though there's still several tenants renting apartment units inside.
“It may get less and less comfortable here as this work carries on around me and they continue to sort of tear the building down around my head,” Fillmore said.
Fillmore says although the new owner wants him and the other tenants out, his lease doesn't expire until the end of April 2017.
Concerns over the demolition happening while tenants still resided in the building have been brought to the city.
“A stop-work order has been issued and the owner of the building has been told to stop demolishing until there is a plan showing how what he's doing isn't going to impact the quality of life and safety of the residents that are still in the house,” Waye Mason, the municipal councillor for the area, said.
A motion was put forward to regional council to expedite the application to designate the home as a heritage property.

“I think that what's happening is the owner of the building wanted to damage the building enough so that it wouldn't qualify as a heritage building anymore,” Mason said.
The motion was defeated 10-6 by council.
Mason says the reason is that the building was already halfway torn down.
GitHub – San Francisco Headquarters
FENNIE+MEHL Architects and Studio Hatch have collaborated on the design of Github's office space in San Francisco.
Wildly quirky, wildly successful GitHub, builder of web-based collaboration tools for software developers, got its start with early employees writing code in dive bars, coffee shops and home offices. Given that this unconventional but agreeable culture helped build a $900 million company in just six years, F+M and Studio Hatch suggested recreating it within the company's new 55,000-square-foot building. Every morning GitHubbers choose where they want to work: in one of two bars, several cafes, a library, a park, a speakeasy, a museum, a coder cave, or from home. Github Scott Chacon, CIO says “F+M is totally about collaboration, they listened, gathered the creatives and made our wish list for our home base come alive in the most unexpected ways. We are thrilled with our space and the connection we have created with this great city of San Francisco.”
At the core of GitHub technology is social collaboration, which we find not only physically evident in their new office space itself but also manifested throughout the design process, a seamless collaboration between client, architect, designer, builder and local manufacturers. The primary objective of the design was to provide a variety of environments to accommodate different personal work styles and flexibility for the space to evolve and transition over time. As a company founded in local cafes and bars around the city, it was important to infuse these types of environments throughout the space as a nod to the company's roots but also to serve as alternative work settings. In addition to a café on each level, the 55,000 rentable sq.ft., three story LEED gold certified work space located in the heart of SOMA boasts a full bar, commercial kitchen, large and small (themed) conference rooms, phone rooms, a dojo, meditation room, indoor park, hidden speakeasy, library, museum, “coder caves,” kid's play ground, and a roof deck lounge.
GitHubbers have total individual freedom and self-assignment in their work space. Some employees never sit at a typical workstation and float between the different work settings with their laptops while others prefer to take up residence at a workstation and have the choice between custom adjustable height desks, movable desks on casters or large communal tables. They also have the option of using a desk located on the “quiet floor” or the more social floor with music. Having choice between different types of seating(lounge, café, desk), and the opportunity to engage in different experiences throughout the day is a crucial part of the bottom-up company model that encourages employees to have a sense of ownership. The seamless blend between work and play encourages authentic interaction and promotes collaboration.
The client was adamant that their space should not be an insular campus. They want their employees to engage with the surrounding community. In this spirit, they also invite the community into their space. The massive first floor with a full bar, commercial kitchen and presentation area is open to non-profits and tech start-ups who are invited to host their own meetings, conferences and events. This area was designed to look and feel like a great event space embracing the hip, warm industrial aesthetic of local bars and restaurants, fully integrating it as part of the neighborhood. The design also honors the rich history of the brick and timber building that GitHub occupies through the use of five vintage shipping containers that were deconstructed and rebuilt onsite as a reference to the train that rolled in and out of the ground floor when the building was a dried fruit packing warehouse in the early 1900s. A faux railroad with brass rails and stamped concrete ties was also added in the same location as the original track to reinforce the building's unique history.
GitHub takes great pride in being an approachable company with a ton of personality. Their playful spirit is evident in the many themed conference rooms including the “Situation Room,” “Rat Pack” room, “Saloon,” safari themed “Game Room,” and of course the faithful replica of the Oval Office which acts as their reception. As the GitHub CEO said himself, “GitHub wants their guests to feel important” and people who sit in the actual Oval Office are pretty important!
UNITED STATES - APRIL 16: A flag flies outside a Sallie Mae building in Reston, Virginia, a suburb of Washington D.C., Monday, April 16, 2007.

Powers/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
Sallie Mae on Monday disclosed new federal probes targeting possible violations of consumer protection laws -- a sign that Washington is ramping up scrutiny of the nation's largest student loan company.
Sallie Mae, the top recipient of Department of Education contracts, told investors in its latest quarterly report that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last month launched an investigation into how the company processes borrowers' payments on student loans.
The CFPB joins the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Department of Justice in probing the company for alleged misdeeds that include payment-processing issues, “unfair or deceptive” practices, discriminatory lending and violating the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a federal law intended to ease financial pressures on active-duty members of the military.
Sallie Mae said it expects to pay penalties to the government and restitution to affected customers, though it didn't specify possible amounts. The FDIC has already told the company it plans to publicly accuse it of violating numerous federal laws. The company said in its quarterly filing that it is “cooperating fully” with the government probes. Patricia Nash Christel, Sallie Mae spokeswoman, declined to elaborate.
Public disclosure of the probes comes as the CFPB ramps up its oversight of student loan servicers, the Education Department faces criticism for its lack of supervision, and Sallie Mae attempts to convince federal regulators to allow the publicly-traded company to split into two. The company bills the split as a way to allow one division to expand its federal business and continue acting as the largest servicer of federal student loans, while the other would focus on extending non-government backed loans to student borrowers.
The CFPB's top student loan official, Rohit Chopra, said in an Oct. 16 report the agency had found widespread problems in how student loan servicers process borrowers' monthly payments. The report stated that servicers commonly misallocate payments, maximizing late fees and penalties and preventing borrowers from paying off loans quickly. Chopra called the practices “troubling.”
Though Chopra's report focused on the roughly $165 billion private student loan market -- a small subset of the overall $1.2 trillion in outstanding student loans -- he suggested many of the same problems may jeopardize borrowers with some $1 trillion in federal student loans from the Education Department's Federal Family Education Loan and Direct Loan programs, where enforcement of federal consumer protection laws is effectively nonexistent.
“The department is aware of Sallie Mae's discussions with federal agencies and will await the outcome of those conversations,” said Stephen Spector, Education Department spokesman. The Education Department previously said it was investigating Sallie Mae's servicing of federal student loans in response to allegations from other government agencies.
The Education Department has been under intense fire in recent months after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned the agency's supervision of companies it pays to collect payments on federal student loans -- most notably Sallie Mae -- and its record as an enforcer of federal law when those companies are alleged to have committed wrongdoing.
In a letter last month, Warren wrote Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew that “despite Sallie Mae's track record,” of “breaking the rules and ignoring its contractual obligations,” the Education and Treasury departments “appear to have given little more than a slap on the wrist” to the company.
Education Department officials previously have said they could not recall any instance of the agency taking a public enforcement action against Sallie Mae, or any other major company, despite what Warren described as clear legal authority to fine companies for wrongdoing.
Analysts who follow Sallie Mae on behalf of investors have grown worried about the company's burgeoning troubles with the government. Over the past several months, Sallie Mae executives have told investors and analysts that it hopes to expand its government business and increase its revenue from federal contracts.
Those aspirations now are under threat due to numerous government investigations and pressure on the Education Department from consumer advocates.
On Oct. 17, during the company's call with investors and analysts to brief them on quarterly earnings, Sanjay Sakhrani, the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst who Institutional Investor ranks as the nation's best in covering consumer finance companies, asked John Remondi, Sallie Mae chief executive, whether the company felt “comfortable” with its practices in light of the CFPB's report that had been made public the previous day.
“So, yeah. We do, absolutely,” Remondi replied. “I think it's fair to say that our customers are not experiencing the problems that are hinted at or implied in that report.”
The CFPB's investigation into the company's processing of payments included a September demand for documents, at least two weeks before Remondi made those remarks. The agency's order, made through what's known as a civil investigative demand, requested information regarding allegations similar to those probed by the FDIC.
The Sallie Mae spokeswoman declined further comment on Remondi's remarks.

Jon Flanagan admits it would be “a dream come true” if he got the chance to make his senior England debut this week.
The Liverpool FC defender is currently in Miami with Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad, as they finalise their preparations for Brazil. Flanagan is one of two standby players – Everton's John Stones being the other – who has been taken by Hodgson to gain experience.
Stones picked up his first cap as a substitute in the friendly win over Peru at Wembley on Friday, and with games to come against Ecuador, tonight, and Honduras, on Saturday, Flanagan now hopes to get a chance himself.
He said: "Coming away with your country, it doesn't get much better than that.
“There are top players from all around the country, so training with them is really good.
"There are another two games before we go home so if I get the chance to make my debut it will be a dream come true.
"He (Stones) handled his own. I thought he did well, got forward and it was a debut to remember.
"As we've seen, young players are getting their chance and those who have come in have taken it with both hands. If I get a chance then hopefully I can take it."
For Flanagan, simply being mentioned as a potential England player represents a huge step. The young full back was on the verge of leaving Liverpool on loan back in the autumn, but established himself as a regular in Brendan Rodgers' side, and has leapt from England's U21s to the verge of the first team.
He said: "The difference is massive. It's a lot quicker and everything about it is more professional.
"There are a lot of Liverpool players in the squad and it helps you out massively. There are also a lot of young lads in the squad who I have played with down the years, so it helps you when you are coming into the squad and makes you feel welcome."

We demoed Intrusion Protocol at a booth at two St. Louis Science Center events before we released to the general public, and I'm so glad we did. The player feedback from those two events helped us identify items that we definitely needed to fix before releasing to the masses. One thing I quickly noticed while demoing is a few spots where we had to give some verbal instruction. “Press this button.” “It may be easier to skip that.” Right off the bat these players showed us things we needed to tweak without even knowing how much they were helping.
Of course, we also got direct feedback from players. While we were nervous to do our first demo booth, we were very happy with the amount of positive feedback we got. Not one person hated the game. Everyone seemed to have the urge to keep going and get to the end, which is exactly what we were going for. However, they also told us things that they thought were unclear, frustrating, or simply not good. Once we collected that feedback, we had a clear list of improvements to make.
Okay, so just add these things and put out the demo. Simple, right? Well, not so fast. Some of these things are easy fixes. Others, not so much. We had a long meeting about what we needed to prioritize. For each item, we had to balance necessity and difficulty. This was the most difficult part of the process. Let's start with the no-brainers.
Pain border: Players had a hard time telling when they were getting hurt by the enemies. We already had a number that pops up by the player sprite when damage occurs. Adding a red flash around the screen was relatively straightforward. Done.
Watergate was about a domestic political break-in. Kremlingate is far darker and more consequential.
Protest in Denver on June 3, 2017. (Photo: David Zalubowski, AP)
Kremlingate, the scandal involving the Trump campaign's possible ties to Russia, has already led to the firing of the FBI director, the appointment of a special counsel and hints that the president may fire the special counsel, too. Naturally this has prompted comparisons to Watergate. But the comparison is unfair — to Richard Nixon.
President Trump's situation is much more serious. He isn't just accused of covering up a “third-rate burglary,” as White House spokesman Ron Ziegler described the break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters 45 years ago this month. He's being investigated for possibly obstructing an investigation into his associates. And they're being investigated for Russia connections as a result of a far more extensive break-in into the computer systems of the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign that was perpetrated by Russian agents.
The wiretapping of the DNC, even if successful, would not have had much impact on the 1972 election, which Nixon won in a landslide. The 2016 election was much closer — decided by just 80,000 votes in three states — and Trump touted the Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks non-stop during the last month of the campaign. The Russian intervention could well have changed the course of U.S. history.
Trump openly applauded this Russian assault on our democracy. That's bad enough. What we don't know yet is whether he was involved in secret deals with the Russians, which would be tantamount to treason. But there is still no proof, either, that Nixon personally ordered the Watergate break-in.
As Nixon famously said: “It's not the crime that gets you … it's the coverup.”
Trump, who has said that he was thinking about "this Russia thing" when he fired James Comey, is now discovering the truth of those words.
Nixon's position became untenable after the release on Aug. 5, 1974, of the “smoking gun” tape, in which he said he wanted to use the CIA to pressure the FBI into ending the Watergate investigation. Three days later, Nixon resigned.
The equivalent conversation for Trump became public June 6 when The Washington Postreported that the president had asked his CIA director and director of national intelligence to pressure the FBI to end its investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Trump also told NBC News that he fired Comey to stop the investigation into the “Russia thing.”
Yet Republicans remain foursquare behind the president. Newt Gingrich, who tried to impeach Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice, now claims, with breathtaking audacity, “Technically the president of the United States cannot obstruct justice.”
Most Republicans were just as willing to excuse the Watergate break-in and coverup, spinning the scandal as a media creation. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., then chairman of the Republican National Committee, opined: “The greatest political scandal of this campaign is the brazen manner in which, without benefit of clergy, The Washington Post has set up housekeeping with the McGovern campaign.”
Republican support for Nixon fell from a high of 90% at the start of the Senate Watergate Committee hearings in 1973 but never dropped below 50% even as his approval among the general public fell to a low of 24%.
Trump also has terrible approval ratings among the public at large (38%) but, like Nixon, he is keeping the support of most of his base — 72% of Republicans still approve of Trump.
POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media
That number is crucial because of the biggest difference between the 1970s and today: Back then, Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, so they could initiate impeachment proceedings with little or no Republican support. Today, Republicans run Congress, and they have shown little enthusiasm for pursuing the Kremlingate probe.
Even if Mueller uncovers convincing evidence that Trump tried to obstruct justice — or if Trump fires Mueller — a sitting president probably can't be indicted. The only real remedy is impeachment. It's unlikely, however, that the House would initiate such proceedings unless Democrats win control in 2018. Even then, there is no way to convict in the Senate, which requires 67 votes, without GOP support. As Jonathan Rauch points out, even if Democrats win every Senate race in 2018, they would still have only 56 seats.
In the summer of 1974, a critical mass of Republicans finally decided they could no longer defend Nixon. “There are only so many lies you can take,” Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona said on Aug. 6. “And now there has been one too many. Nixon should get his ass out of the White House — today!”
Trump's fate depends on how many lies today's Republicans can swallow. So far, there is no indication that they have had their fill, but it's still early: 447 days elapsed between the appointment of special prosecutor Archibald Cox on May 18, 1973, and Nixon's resignation on Aug. 8, 1974. We're less than 40 days past May 17, the day Mueller accepted the same role.

Rogers questions the ethics of a news outlet accepting stolen information. Rogers: Greenwald illegally sold docs
A top lawmaker argued Tuesday that journalist Glenn Greenwald is illegally selling stolen material by asking news organizations to pay for access to U.S. intelligence secrets taken from the National Security Agency.
“For personal gain, he's now selling his access to information, that's how they're terming it…. A thief selling stolen material is a thief,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers (R-Mich.) told journalists after a hearing where the leaks set in motion by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. were a major topic of discussion.
Story Continued Below
Rogers said the information about the documents being for sale by Greenwald came from “other nations' press services.”
( Also on POLITICO: Congress approves five-year farm bill)
During the hearing on global threats to U.S. interests, Rogers raised the issue repeatedly, referring to “discussions of selling access to this material to both newspaper outlets and other places.”
“To the best of your knowledge, fencing stolen material — is that a crime?” he asked FBI Director James Comey.
“It would be,” in most cases, Comey said. However, he quickly added that it would be “complicated” in a situation where the person selling that information was engaged in a newsgathering activity because of “First Amendment implications.”
“If I'm a newspaper reporter for fill-in-the-blank and I sell stolen material, is that legal because I'm a newspaper reporter?” asked Rogers, who did not mention Greenwald by name during the hearing but made the reference to him clear later in response to reporters' questions.
( Also on POLITICO: Bill O'Reilly: I'm an ‘annoyance' for Obama)
“If you're a newspaper reporter and you're hawking stolen jewelry, it's still a crime,” Comey said, before adding that the issue of a journalist selling access to information was “a harder question.”
Comey indicated that he was reluctant to speak in detail about Snowden's case since the FBI has an active investigation into that matter.
When Rogers asked if that probe encompassed the possibility that “accomplices” of Snowden were brokering stolen information, Comey replied: “We are looking at the totality of circumstances around the stolen information.”
Greenwald, an American journalist and lawyer working until recently for Britain's Guardian newspaper, firmly denied selling any of Snowden's documents. In an interview with POLITICO, the writer said he has helped prepare stories based on the documents in various news outlets under typical freelance contracts.
“I'm never selling documents,” Greenwald said, adding that he makes the freelance arrangements so that prosecutors can't accuse him of being a source rather than a reporter. “What they're trying to do is to remove it from the realm of journalism, so that they can then criminalize it,” he said.
( From POLITICO Magazine: The robots that saved Pittsburgh)
Greenwald has said he has access to a trove of documents from Snowden, most or all copied while by him working at an NSA facility in Hawaii. Stories based on those files have been appearing in news outlets worldwide.
In testimony Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper fueled the notion that journalists or others could face prosecution for working with Snowden. He did so by also referring to those individuals as “accomplices.”
“Snowden claims that he's won and that his mission is accomplished. If that is so, I call on him and his accomplices to facilitate the return of the remaining stolen documents that have not yet been exposed to prevent even more damage to U.S. security,” Clapper said, repeating comments he made last week at a parallel Senate hearing.
Snowden faces charges of disclosing national defense information, disclosing communications intelligence secrets and theft of government property, according to the cover page of a criminal complaint made public in June.
The details of the charges remain sealed. However, there have been no indications that anyone else has been charged in connection with the disclosures.
( Also on POLITICO: White House pushes back hard amid CBO fallout)
Attorney General Eric Holder has said that he could not foresee prosecuting those engaged “in true journalistic activity.”
In an October interview, NSA Director Keith Alexander said he was disturbed that journalists were “selling” the data Snowden copied while working at the spy agency.
“I think it's wrong that that newspaper reporters have all these documents, the 50,000—whatever they have and are selling them and giving them out as if these — you know it just doesn't make sense,” Alexander told the Defense Department's “Armed With Science” blog.
“We ought to come up with a way of stopping it. I don't know how to do that. That's more of the courts and the policymakers but, from my perspective, it's wrong to allow this to go on,” he added.

Newer weatherproof compact and high-end cameras often feature “freeze-proofing” as one of their attributes, but unless you live in an extremely cold environment (or enjoy sticking your camera inside a freezer), you probably haven't experienced temperatures low enough for even an ordinary camera to break down.
Swiss photographer Alessandro Della Bella has. The photographer above shows what one of his cameras recently looked like during a shoot in extremely low temperatures.
Back on 12/12/12, Alessandro participated in the One Day on Earth project, which aims to document life around the globe on a single day. He chose to create a time-lapse video of the night sky during two nights on the Swiss mountains Piz Corvatsch and Piz Nair. The temperature during those nights? -25°C and -15°C, respectively (-13°F and 5°F).
Here's an example of a scene he was shooting:
Alessandro shot more than 10,000 photographs over those 48 hours showing the stars above and the valley below, snapping frames with 5 Canon DSLRs at the same time.
Although the DSLRs survived the project unscathed — they actually performed quite nicely — the extremely cold temperatures did present their fair share of problems for Alessandro.
First, he had to bring a number of extra lenses along on the shoot. Every time a lens froze up, he swapped it out and defrosted it in front of an oven until it became normal again.
Alessandro says that the weak link in the gear was actually the batteries. At those temperatures, each battery drained in just an hour or two of shooting, so they had to be constantly swapped out and recharged.
Here's the beautiful time-lapse video that resulted from his efforts:
So there you have it — an interesting look at what camera companies mean when they say a camera is “freeze-proof.”

New Commemorative Logo Kicks Off Festivities Leading to First Solo Film in 2017
To mark the 75th anniversary of one of the world's best-known Super Heroes, Warner Bros. Entertainment and DC Entertainment today unveiled plans for a year-long celebration of Wonder Woman. The character has transcended the pages of comics to become a powerful global symbol of justice, equality and peace.
Beginning with a new commemorative logo honoring the Amazon Princess's legacy, highlights of the year will include the relaunch of her comic book series; new graphic novels; convention panels; and consumer products, including apparel, toys and other exclusive merchandise. These and further anniversary events will culminate in the release of the very first “Wonder Woman” feature film on June 2, 2017.
First seen in October 1941 in All-Star Comics #8 in a back-up story meant to test her appeal at a time when female superheroes were rare, Wonder Woman quickly broke out and headlined her own title by the next year. Subsequent generations came to know the star-spangled heroine with metal bracelets on her wrists and a magic lasso by her waist via her hit 1975-79 television series and roles in animated shows and movies, as well as her historic appearance on the cover Ms. Magazine #1 in 1972. This past March, Wonder Woman was seen for the first time in a live action motion picture with her introduction in the global blockbuster “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.”
“Wonder Woman is a legend around the world and one of the most valuable franchises at our studio, and we're thrilled to celebrate this anniversary,” said Kevin Tsujihara, Chief Executive Officer, Warner Bros. “Millions of fans already know her from comic books, television, and her big screen debut in ‘Batman v Superman,' but the upcoming year building to her first solo film will be the most dynamic and exciting in the character's history.”
Over the decades, Wonder Woman has run for president, organized a union, flown an invisible plane, lost and regained her powers, studied martial arts, battled Ares, the God of War, worked at a fast food chain, and had a romantic relationship with Superman. Her diverse history will be integrated and celebrated in a new comic book series launching this month as part of DC Universe: Rebirth that honors what fans love most about the character.
Written by fan favorite Greg Rucka and on sale June 22nd, Wonder Woman #1 will be the first print debut of the new Wonder Woman 75th commemorative logo. Other variations of the new logo created for various products merge the character's name and traditional “W” symbols with the number 75, set alongside a striking blue silhouette of the iconic character in a warrior stance.
“Wonder Woman has long stood with Batman and Superman in the trinity of DC's most iconic Super Heroes, but she also stands alone as a symbol of equality, justice and female empowerment and is more relevant today than ever,” said Diane Nelson, President of DC Entertainment, President of Warner Bros. Consumer Products, and President and Chief Content Officer of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. “With her roots in Greek mythology and American feminism, Wonder Woman is one of the most unique and compelling characters in comic book history; her longevity is a testament to her global appeal and the special place she holds in the hearts of generations of girls who have imagined wielding their own lassos of truth.”
Created by William Moulton Marston, a psychologist who invented the lie-detecting polygraph machine, Wonder Woman was conceived as a new type of superhero who used wisdom and compassion, not just her fists, to triumph over evil. Daughter of the queen of the all-female Amazon tribe from Greek mythology, Wonder Woman was imbued by the gods with powers, including super-strength and a lasso that compels anyone it surrounds to tell the truth. Wearing a costume inspired by the flag of a downed American pilot, she travelled to “patriarch's world” to fight for such values as peace and equality. She is the only female comic book character to have her own stories continuously published for the past three quarters of a century.
Among the events and products Wonder Woman fans can look forward to over the next year from Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment are:
On Sunday evening, I put on my concierge hat. I had to pick up something for a client.
Since I did not know the place where I was going I looked for directions and went to Google Maps as I trust them more than MapQuest.
I followed the instructions to the letter and did not get anywhere.
If it was not for a good Samaritan who got in her car and led me to the place, I would still be looking for it.
Out of curiosity, I decided a few minutes ago to put Rand McNally Online Driving Directions which I never used to the test.
They were spot on.
I guess I have to believe their tagline (below).
The moral of the story is that in the future, I will get two sets of directions, one from Google Maps, the other from Rand McNally.
I don't know if they got their inspiration from Jack Kerouac for their travel blog name, On the Road.
Won't get lost again!
Hopefully.

Kurdistan: From Referendum to the Road to Independence
By Dr. Edy Cohen June 24, 2017 June 24, 2017
Greater Zab River near Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, Wikipedia
BESA Center Perspectives Paper No. 507, June 24, 2017
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: On September 25, a referendum will be held on the future of the Kurdistan region of Iraq. The vote will decide whether autonomous Kurdistan should disengage from Iraq and become an independent state or remain within the Iraqi state. The referendum will be the Iraqi Kurds' first concrete step towards the realization of the more than century-long dream of an independent Kurdish state.
After WWI, the victorious powers promised independence for the Kurds. This did not materialize, however, mainly due to the opposition of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.
Since then, the Kurds have suffered persecution and oppression in the countries where they reside: Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The Kurds now constitute the largest national group in the world without a state to call their own.
Since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the Kurds have enjoyed a broad autonomy that has rekindled their aspiration for independence. This aspiration gained great momentum due to the considerable assistance provided by the Peshmerga, the Kurdish military militia, to the war effort against ISIS, without which the Iraqi army would not have succeeded in liberating the Mosul area from the Islamist terrorist organization. But there is a certain irony to the Iraqi victories in Kurdistan: they led to a mini-crisis between the Baghdad government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) over the revival of Kurdish national aspirations.
On this subject, it seems there has been no change in the position of the current Iraqi government in relation to that of its predecessors. According to the central government and Iraqi public figures who oppose Kurdish independence, the Kurds – like Assyrians, Yazidis, and Turkmens – are an inseparable part of Iraqi society who must not disengage from the Iraqi motherland.
Moreover, harsh disputes exist between the KRG and the Iraqi government over oil ownership in Kurdistan and the reimbursement of funds demanded by the government for the sale of that oil. Unexpected support on this matter was recently received from Saudi Arabia, which sought to take revenge on Ankara for its support of Qatar.
As for Israel, while there is a thunderous official silence on the subject, there is no doubt that Jerusalem would support an independent Kurdish state. About three years ago, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared Israel's support for the establishment of such a state in the part of Iraq where Kurdish autonomy is today. “We must support the Kurds' aspirations for independence; they deserve it,” Netanyahu declared in a speech at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.
This statement received a harsh response from Nuri al-Maliki, former prime minister of Iraq (2006-14), who repeatedly told the media pejoratively that Kurdistan would be a “second Israel.” When Israeli reporters arrived in Iraq to cover the war on ISIS, Maliki did not hide his anger. Many other Iraqi leaders besides Maliki accuse the president of the Kurdish autonomous region, Massoud Barzani, of collaborating with Israel, thereby hinting at the military assistance given by Israel in the 1960s and 1970s to the Kurds under the leadership of Mustafa Barzani (Massoud's father) in their war against the central government.
Few countries support a referendum and the granting of independence to the Kurdish people in their state. The Kurdish region, which has no sea outlet and is surrounded by enemies, shares a border with Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Turkey. These countries, especially Iran and Turkey, all strongly oppose the establishment of a Kurdish state. They fear, like Maliki, that Kurdistan – which has managed to build a friendly island of calm and stability in an area surrounded by enemies and war – will indeed become that distasteful thing, a “second Israel.” This expression has been used extensively in recent years whenever the issue of Kurdistan's independence has made headlines.
It is entirely possible that the Iranians and the Turks will try to derail the referendum and divide the Kurdish factions.
For its part, Israel has an economic and security interest in supporting a Kurdish state. In view of the profusion of jihadist militias in Syria and Iraq, Jerusalem must be involved in developments in Kurdistan. It would be in Israel's interest for the IDF to train and instruct Peshmerga soldiers in any future Kurdish state. One could go further – it might be sensible to build an air force base in Kurdistan for the state's protection. Moreover, the independent Kurdish state may well allow the restitution of its former Jewish population, driven from Iraq for its plundered property, thus setting an important precedent for future Arab-Israeli peace agreements.
Beyond these vital interests, the people of Israel greatly sympathize with the just struggle of the Kurds. There are many commonalities between the Kurdish people and the Jewish people, both of whom have suffered continuous long-term persecution and are scattered throughout the world.
Iran, Turkey, and the Arab states will never support the independence of Kurdistan. The Kurds must lose no time after the referendum in declaring their disengagement from Iraq and the establishment of the independent state of Kurdistan.
In all probability, the state of Kurdistan will be an island of stability that is respectful of human rights. It will therefore differ substantially from the countries surrounding it. The Trump administration should support the referendum and the independence of the Kurdistan region and its disengagement from Iraq, since this development is of interest to the entire region.
The Kurdish people must have a state of their own, and the sooner the better. The international community should support the independence of Kurdistan, not only the establishment of a Palestinian state. Self-determination and independence should be the prerogative of all peoples, not a principle selectively applied.

HEADS shook in horror when Toowoomba's first strip club opened last week.
Now, the controversial establishment has further raised the hackles of angry locals by opening a topless barber shop.
Hairdresser/stripper Bree Francis is giving the in-your-face haircuts as a cheeky added attraction at The Vault on Ruthven St.
“A fellow last week paid for three haircuts just to look at my boobs and then he gave me a $120 tip afterwards,'' Ms Francis, 21, said.
“It's so different from normal hairdressing. I'm more comfortable because I'm naked.''
But Toowoomba locals who fought unsuccessfully to stop The Vault from opening in a former Commonwealth Bank building say the topless barber shop is “just rubbing our noses in it”.
Local church leader Paul Galligan said 3000 locals objected to the “striptease joint”, along with senior police, the Toowoomba City Council, Chamber of Commerce and local Newman government MP Trevor Watts.
But the Queensland Civil and Administrative Appeals Tribunal last month rejected an appeal against the decision to grant LA Showgirls Pty Ltd an adult entertainment permit to open the $2.5 million club.
Mr Galligan, who heads Revival Ministries which runs a Christian teaching centre about 100m from The Vault, said he was shocked it had been approved in the face of such fierce community opposition.
“It has only been open a little over a week but already the evil fruit of it is evident,'' he told The Sunday Mail.
“As a long-time Toowoomba-ite, I'm just shocked this thing was allowed.''
Mr Galligan said the area had become a red-light district.
“There's been a drastic change of atmosphere in this part of town since the striptease joint opened,'' he said.
“We are seeing drunkenness in the street, foul language and threatening behaviour. It's frightening.''
Mr Galligan said locals were upset they could not use morality as a ground of objection against the strip club.
He said objectors were considering a Supreme Court appeal and he had written complaints to Premier Campbell Newman and Attorney-General Jarrod Bleijie.
Well, this news is a long time coming for most Star Trek Fans. Apparently, CBS is hard at work remastering the Next Generation as an HD offering, and will beam it to you via Netflix this fall.
While no official announcement has been made, the rumblings got a Geordi-sized boost earlier this month when actor LaVar Burton, he of the visor fame, tweeted that the remastering progress being made on a few select TNG episodes was going very, very well. Also complementing all that was Netflix's pre-existing relationship with CBS, which saw the DVD and streaming service beaming all Star Trek series episodes to customers.

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush has dropped out of the Republican race for US president after failing to rank high in the first three state contests.
He came a distant fourth in Saturday's South Carolina vote, which was won by billionaire estate mogul Donald Trump.
"Today I am suspending my campaign," an emotional Mr Bush told his supporters.
Once a favourite mainstream candidate for the Republicans - and brother and son to two US presidents - Mr Bush saw his campaign flag in recent months.
The Bush who failed
In South Carolina, where he was pinning his hopes on a resurgence in his campaign, he came joint fourth with Ohio governor John Kasich.
"The people from Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire have spoken, and I really respect their decision," the former governor said, in reference to his poor performance in the three states that have already held their presidential primaries and caucuses.
"I've got an incredible life and for me, public service has been the highlight of this life," he added.

Jeb Bush, the son of former President George HW Bush and brother to former President George W Bush, failed to translate huge funds and Republican donations into votes.
He was overtaken in the polls by Mr Trump and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who sold themselves as anti-establishment alternatives to his mainstream candidacy.
The Republican pack will now look to back Florida Senator Marco Rubio, once Jeb Bush's protégé, who tied in second place with Mr Cruz in South Carolina.
"After tonight, this has become a three-person race and we will win the nomination," Mr Rubio told his supporters as the results emerged.

MoPac and Loop 360 is one of the busiest intersections in Austin and a real hazard for bicyclists and runners. But a new bridge will get them off the highway and take them over the traffic. It's the second bridge in the Southwest Austin area that's under construction and only months away from giving cyclists and pedestrians a safe way to get to Zilker Park and the downtown area.
"We are approximately 90 percent done with the columns," said Chad Crager with Austin Public Works.
Seven columns, taller than the trees they were designed to imitate, are sticking up from the Barton Creek Greenbelt.
"The middle of the column itself looks like a tree trunk," said Crager.
The bridge will blend in.
"People will be able to really soar over the trees as bicyclists or pedestrians," said Crager.
But what sticks out is that this is the missing link that has kept Southwest Austin from connecting to many of the city's other urban trails.
A rendering of the 14-foot-wide bridge positions it as a side-by-side alternative to using MoPac to cross the Barton Creek Greenbelt.
"Some people were brave enough on a Saturday or Sunday morning to ride the frontage roads. The average family was not doing that," said Crager.
Most families are also not ready to risk a ride through the intersection of MoPac and Loop 360.
"So many vehicles at such a high speed going through that intersection," said Crager.
Which is why a second MoPac mobility bridge is now under construction to take bicyclists and pedestrians up and over the traffic.
"I kind of look at these projects as one," said Crager.
Together the bridges along MOPAC are designed to ensure Southwest Austin is linked to the city's all ages network of urban trails.
"It's a nice thing for us coming from the south to kind of feel connected right back into the heart of the city and every other fun trail," said Joanna Garrison who lives in Southwest Austin.
Once bicyclists and pedestrians make it across both bridges a new urban trail is being built into the side of a hill that sits on the side of MoPac. It will link the trail all the way to Zilker Park. The Loop 360 bridge is set to be completed in December. The longer bridge over the Barton Creek Greenbelt should be finished in the spring of 2016.

Municipal broadband networks are not as great as they are made out to be.
George Ford (Photo: Submitted)
On June 14 The Tennessean ran a story entitled Chattanooga Mayor: Gigabit Speed Internet Helped Revive City in which Mayor Andy Berke touts the economic impact of the municipal broadband system in his city.
Chattanooga's fiber system required a $330 million investment, with $105 million coming from federal taxpayers. A sizeable share has also been shouldered by the city's captive electricity ratepayers. Demonstrating the economic benefits of such massive investments — about $4,400 per customer — is a necessary political task, albeit a tricky one, especially since most Chattanoogans purchase service from private providers in that city. Upon inspection, the mayor's claims just don't add up.
Mayor Berke's lead claim is that the “city's unemployment rate has dropped to 4.1 percent from 7.8 percent,” over the past three years. Yet, over the same period, the nationwide unemployment rate fell from 7.5 percent to 4.7 percent. In terms of unemployment, Chattanooga isn't much different than the nation as a whole. Unless the Chattanooga system is having nationwide economic impacts, it's pretty clear that attributing the unemployment decline to a city broadband network is bogus.
Looking at the unemployment rates within Tennessee presents an even more interesting story. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides unemployment data for twenty-six cities in Tennessee. Of those, Chattanooga's decline ranks near the bottom—24th out of 26 —and is 20% below average.
In the present absence of federal handouts for broadband network construction, the captive electric ratepayers serve as an excellent source of cross-subsidies for the unprofitable municipal systems. As a result of a high incidence of municipally-provided electricity, it's little surprise that Tennessee has many municipal broadband systems. For those cities operating broadband networks, unemployment has fallen by an average of 4.0 points.
EPB just announced access to speeds of 10GB, making Chattanooga the first 10-gigabit city in the world. Other Gig Cities in Tennessee with fiber-optic programs in various stages of deployment include Jackson, Tullahoma, Clarksville, Pulaski, Bristol and Morristown. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)
In cities without municipal systems, unemployment has fallen by 4.7 points, a statistically significant difference of 0.7 points. Thus, if declining unemployment is the measuring stick, then the evidence is decidedly against government-owned networks. In May 2016, unemployment in muni-broadband cities was 4.3 percent, which is higher than the 4.1 percent rate in non-muni-broadband cities. The number of actual jobs in Chattanooga grew by 3.6 percent, slightly below the city average of 3.9 percent. While the job market in Tennessee is recovering, it's not being driven by municipal broadband.
Broadband networks are expensive to construct and upgrade. Private investment exceeds one hundred billion annually. If there's money to be made, then private providers will make the necessary investments.
If there's no money in it, then there's an obvious reluctance to invest. Getting broadband to unserved areas is a difficult and expensive proposition, since by definition investing where the private sector will not will assuredly lead to financial losses and thus higher taxes or electricity rates to cover the difference.
Cities across the country have tried to build and operate networks, dependent on a near constant influx of government money. As economics predicts, the record of such ventures is abysmal, with scarcely any exceptions. A former poster child of municipal broadband in Bristol, Virginia, is being sold for pennies on the dollar and three executives are doing time for corruption. Similar scenarios are in plentiful supply.

The level of bogosity about the benefits of municipal broadband is at an all-time high, and Mayor Burke's use of unemployment data only adds to the stock of nonsense aimed ultimately at the government monopolizing broadband and communications. When that day comes, we can be as happy with our broadband as we are with our roads, postal service, and public education — that is, not too happy.

Malcolm Little was born in the American South. His father, a Christian minister, was murdered by white racists in 1931. Several years later, because of their great poverty, and her mental illness, he and his siblings were taken from their mother by social workers and put into a children's home. He was later fostered but got into trouble (he was once sent to reform school for putting a thumb tack on a teacher's chair).
Although a brilliant student he drifted into a life of petty crime. While in prison he became converted to the Nation of Islam (the Black Muslims) and when released he became one of their most effective evangelists and leaders.
After a pilgrimage to Mecca he left the Nation of Islam and became a "mainstream" Muslim, but he was assassinated by members of the Nation of Islam in 1965, leaving three daughters and a widow pregnant with twins.
He is known as one of the most influential of all the civil rights activists of the 1950s and 1960s.

Wait until January before you cast judgment on Windows 8, they said. That's when the big boost from holiday sales will—or won't—show up, and you'll be able to get a better idea of how the operating system is doing. Well, Net Application's January desktop usage data is in. What do the numbers show? Is Windows 8's usage rate lagging?
It depends on how you look at it.
Net Applications Net Application's January desktop share data.
Let's get the bleak news out of the way first. Three months after its release, Microsoft's new-look operating system was found on 2.26 percent of all the traditional PCs tracked by Net Applications, whose web measurement network is comprised of 40,000 websites that receive roughly 160 million unique visits each month. By comparison, Windows 7 claimed a 7.57 percent browser share at its three-month mark, while Windows Vista was sitting slightly less pretty with a 3.3 percent share three months in.
The monthly gulf between Windows Vista's uptake and Windows 8's uptake is only widening, in other words. People still consider Windows Vista to be a stinker, rightly or wrongly, and that reputation no doubt helped to fuel Windows 7's lightning-fast adoption. Conversely, Windows 7's all-around excellence is likely holding back Windows 8—there simply isn't a compelling reason to leap to Windows 8 and its redesigned modern UI if you're a happy Windows 7 user.
Don't be hasty to blame Windows 8's slow uptake on declining PC sales, either. While the computer industry did suffer a contraction in 2012, digging through data from Gartner—a research analytics firm—reveals that just over 90 million PCs were sold in fourth quarters of both 2009 and 2012 (the launch windows for Windows 7 and 8, respectively). In fact, about 300,000 more PCs sold in the fourth quarter of 2012 than in 2009. The appearance of Windows 7 gave PC sales a tremendous shot in the arm, however, while Windows 8's launch has not.
A silver lining appears!
Microsoft's discount $40 rate for an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro ended January 31.
The news isn't all bad for Microsoft, though. The various Windows iterations still account for nearly 92 percent of all desktop visitors to Net Application's websites. Windows as a family is doing fine, even if Windows 8 is struggling to make an impact.
Plus, while Windows 8 might not be living up to the usage standards established by its forebears, it's almost caught up to Apple. Mac OS X 10.8—you may know it better as "Mountain Lion"—has been available since all the way back in July, and it still only claims a 2.44 percent usage share in Net Application's report, despite the appearance of new iMacs and Retina Display-packing MacBook Pro laptops. Expect Windows 8's usage share to sneak past Mountain Lion's this month.
It can malfunction (just search Sandisk ultra fit too hot) which is a pain to deal with and may result in at least partial if not complete loss of all files.
I'm not a hardware expert at all (uneducated guesswork incoming) but it seems like the computer is trying to ask the USB flash drive something, as if the PC has sent a little inspector to USB town to find out where everyone lives: this little guy goes up and down the streets of USB town knocking on doors and taking notes so the PC knows the locations of all the streets and houses in USB town.
He visits all the houses in USB town in the blink of an eye and everything goes well until he comes to a house where the lights are on but no one is home. So he knocks. No answer. He knocks again. Still no answer. He keeps knocking and knocking trying to find out who lives here which causes a lot of electricity to be pointlessly sent to the USB device causing it to heat up to skin burning temperatures very fast (which is very bad if it's plugged directly into a USB slot, not so bad if its on a USB extension cable as that's easier to replace). As the heat engulfs USB town like a sudden super volcano just erupted from the house the inspector was stuck at and the nearby houses seem to malfunction to causing the problem to spread. Attempts to use File Explorer and file transfers will fail as USB town becomes unresponsive.
A quick format followed by a more thorough format seems to return things to normal working order and I managed to slap my 40GB of music back onto it without further issues but as the device is a ticking time bomb I'm hesitant to leave it plugged into anything unsupervised. Even at the end of a USB extension cable to prevent heat damage to USB sockets the continous power draw may be damaging to devices like my TV and Xbox.
GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Fed up with the injuries that plagued his team, Green Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy decided to do something drastic.
No, this wasn't McCarthy's response last week when he summarized the 2016 season in his annual wrap-up news conference.
This was three years ago, when after a 2013 season in which the Packers had 15 players on injured reserve and used 30 different players on offense, 30 different players on defense and 58 on special teams.
After a season in which the Packers were hit hard by injuries, coach Mike McCarthy acknowledged the team will consider adjusting its non-traditional practice routines. Mark Hoffman/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel via USA TODAY NETWORK
After that, McCarthy overhauled his weekly in-season practice schedule to a format that, when preparing for a normal Sunday game on a full week, had the team practice Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. Gone was the Friday practice, to be replaced by a recovery day that included massages and other soft-tissue treatments and then a practice on the day before the game, which most teams don't do.
For two years, it appeared to have a significant impact. The number of players on injured reserve dropped and so did the amount of players who appeared in games (see accompanying chart).
Players used by Packers 2013-16 2016 2015 2014 2013 Offense 29 27 28 30 Defense 29 28 24 30 Special teams 53 53 53 58 Injured reserve 7 7 10 15
Until this past season. Although the number of players on injured reserve (seven) remained the same as last season, at least one other measure showed how many banged-up players the Packers had to deal with.
According to ESPN Stats & Information, the Packers ruled out players 49 times this past season on their injury reports. That was the third most in the NFL behind the Steelers (61) and Colts (56). It was more than the Packers had the two previous seasons combined (17 in 2015 and 20 in 2014).
“It was an issue this year, no doubt about it,” McCarthy said last week in his season wrap-up news conference.
McCarthy wasn't ready to abandon his non-traditional practice schedule, but he didn't rule out changes, either. Several times this season, players were either added to the injury report after the Saturday practice or downgraded following the session.
“You have to look at all those things because, trust me, if it was just one thing -- if it was the Saturday practice or if it was dehydration -- that would've been fixed already,” McCarthy said.
“With that, we had all these injuries. We are constantly researching that. But I can promise you that these guys are dialed in. They have schedules. We don't really have a lot of issues, I mean we haven't had very many weight issues or issues where guys are dehydrated because we're testing them and it's education and the application of that happens all the time, and they're into it. You talk to our veterans, our veterans are really into it.
“Aaron Rodgers is a great example. Aaron is, in my opinion, in the best shape of his career. So we're a lot better there and that's the disappointment of how many injuries we have, so we need to find some answers there and we'll change and adjust accordingly.”
Of the Packers' seven players on injured reserve, only two were full-time starters: Eddie Lacy and Sam Shields. But those two positions, running back and cornerback, were hit harder than any others.
Lacy played in just five of a possible 19 games, including playoffs, while his backup to start the season, James Starks, appeared in just nine. General manager Ted Thompson didn't keep any other halfbacks on the roster to open the season, which forced McCarthy to move Ty Montgomery from receiver.
At cornerback, the combination of Shields, Damarious Randall and Quinten Rollins -- the Packers' top three on the depth chart to start the season -- missed a total of 29 games, including playoffs, because of injuries. Demetri Goodson, who was No. 4 or 5 on the depth chart, missed another 13 games because of to suspension or injury.
“I give our players on offense a ton of credit, really starting with the quarterback and offensive line, because those guys made more adjustments than anybody to play that way,” McCarthy said. “You have to be able to do that, and we did it better on offense than we did on defense. But in fairness to the defense, the challenge came at the primary position [cornerback].”

I need a new bank.
I've been a member of Barclays Bank since I was 14-years-old. My son lost his debit card, and I wanted them to issue a new one but they wouldn't. I had to go to the bank to make it so.
I told the customer service representative that if she didn't send me a new card, I would leave, and break the Davy/Barclays Bank lineage forever. I thought that was a powerful move. I couldn't see her eyes, but I bet she didn't blink.
As I said, I need a new bank.
Perhaps, Bankera is the new bank of my dreams?
The bank named after a mushroom is an idea spawned from the brightest minds within the digital currency exchange, e-wallet, debit card, and payment processing giant SpectroCoin.
It's a new bank, for a new generation of bankers, and I'm writing about it because one of the company's advisors is the one and only Tony G. G has always been a big supporter of cryptocurrency. During his massive presence in the gambling industry, he made TonyBet cryptocurrency compliant for both withdrawals and deposits, and he also champions the disruptive currency during his role as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).
In a echoed speech at the 2016 IMCO Committee at the European Parliament, Tony G urged fellow politicians to purchase cryptocurrencies, because how else could they build laws around something they don't understand.
Tony G is leading by example.
Bankera will be one of the first cryptocurrency banks, giving them a head start on the competition. You will be able to make payments and deposits, take out loans, and take investment advice with the full support of cryptocurrencies.
To kick things off, Bankera is holding an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). The cryptocurrency will be known as “Bankers” (BNK), which interestingly rhymes with a word I used to describe the management that run Barclays Bank.

UN Stops Humanitarian Relief Offers After Syrian Troops Liberate Half of Eastern Aleppo
TEHRAN (FNA)- The Russian Defense Ministry Friday urged the United Nations to start providing real humanitarian aid to the residents of Aleppo instead of merely talking about it.
The United Nations has not provided humanitarian assistance to the liberated parts of Eastern Aleppo, Syria, Russian Defense Ministry Spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov was quoted as saying on Friday by Sputnik.
"Unfortunately, there is no UN humanitarian relief in the liberated areas of Eastern Aleppo," Konashenkov said.
He said that the ministry was unaware of some 30,000 residents who fled Eastern Aleppo receiving humanitarian assistance, as estimated by UN special envoy for Syria Jan Egeland on Thursday.
Konashenkov voiced hope that Egeland would "instead of unsubstantiated allegations finally embark on real work of providing humanitarian aid to the residents of Eastern Aleppo.
"The United Nations has stopped its proposals of humanitarian aid deliveries after Syrian government forces liberated 40 percent of Eastern Aleppo neighborhoods," the Russian Defense Ministry said Friday.
"After the liberation by government troops of more than 40 percent of the city's Eastern districts, home to about 90,000 inhabitants, all proposals for the delivery of humanitarian aid to Aleppo stopped," Konashenkov said.
Back in April, virtual reality (VR) content creator and distributor Wevr launched Transport, a free early access app for Samsung Gear VR that acts as an immersive network collating weird and wonderful experiences. Today Wevr Transport takes the next step on its journey to becoming a premium VR content platform by introducing a yearly subscription. There's also the debut release of Old Friend to mark the occasion.
Old Friend originally premiered at Tribeca Film Festival this year winning several “best-of” awards in the process, before being showcased at the Kaleidoscope Film Festival. In the VR experience viewers will lose themselves in a vibrant psychedelic dance party brimming with joyful insanity and elegant dance routines. The animated VR music video experience was created by filmmaker Tyler Hurd for the song “Old Friend” by Future Islands.
Hurd's previous VR offerings include BUTTS: The VR Experience, again a visually surreal yet thought provoking title. This tells the story of a blue man, who is happy in his strange way of bouncing around. While doing this he comes across a sad orange man. He is lonely and depressed, however the blue man takes it upon himself to make him feel better.
For the launch of Wevr Transport's premium tier there will be four experiences available, Old Friend, Finding Your True Self (by Deepak Chopra), theBlu: Season 1 (Whale Encounter, Reef Migration, Luminous Abyss) and Waves (premiered at Sundance Film Festival 2016). The premium tier will have an annual subscription rate of $20 USD for HTC Vive users, while Gear VR owners have to pay $8. With it Wevr wants to embrace and nurture VR creatives, helping establish a sustainable business model for that community to continue to evolve and flourish for years to come.
Old Friend will also be available through Steam / Viveport / and Oculus Store for $2.99 on from 22nd December 2016. For all the latest Wevr updates, keep reading VRFocus.
Five months after President Donald Trump tweeted a doctored video of himself beating up CNN in WWE-style, his latest attack on the network was a little more subtle. But only a little.
On Sunday morning, Trump retweeted this image in which he's seated in a limo on his car phone with the word “WINNING” written across the top. But if you look closely at the bottom of his shoe, you'll see the bloody insult.
That's a blood-spattered CNN logo. In case you need a closer look…
@shawgerald4/Twitter
A few minutes later, Trump blasted what he calls “fake news” and “fake polls” (as Vox noted this week, he has the lowest-rated poll numbers of any first-year president in history).
The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is. They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News. Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well – nobody is going to beat us. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2017
But is Trump spending the morning of Christmas Eve watching the network he professes to hate? It's possible.
Trump's dismal approval ratings have come up on CNN's “Inside Politics” several times this hour. Coincidence? https://t.co/f2bI4UqrYT — Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) December 24, 2017
It also appears Trump is not winning the battle when people are asked about who to trust more. In October, a poll showed that people were trusting the media more and trusting Trump less.
James Roberts, a 23-year-old recent graduate of Loughborough University in the U.K., has just been announced as the international winner of the 2014 James Dyson Award. His winning project was truly remarkable. It's a portable, inflatable incubator for preterm babies that only costs around £250 ($400) to make, compared to the roughly £30,000 ($47,000) price of conventional hospital incubators. Roberts was inspired to develop the incubator after seeing the shocking infant mortality statistics in refugee camps, where the price tag and prevailing conditions mean purchasing traditional incubators is out of the question.
The incubator, known as the MOM, opens and closes like an accordion for easy transportation. It runs off a battery that lasts 24 hours, so it can be used in areas with patchy or no electricity. The incubator is inflated manually, is heated using ceramic heating elements and has a phototherapy unit for treated jaundiced infants. A screen shows the customizable interior temperature and humidity, and an alarm will sound in the event the temperature changes.

Of his design, Roberts said: “I was inspired to tackle this problem after watching a documentary on the high death rate among premature babies in refugee camps. It motivated me to use my design engineering skills to make a difference. Like many young inventors, there have been struggles along the way – I had to sell my car to fund my first prototype! The dream would be to meet a child that my incubator has saved – living proof that my design has made a difference.”
According to the World Health Organization, 75 percent of deaths resulting from premature birth could be avoided if inexpensive treatments were more readily available worldwide. The stresses of war and life in refugee camps are also leading to increases in premature births in conflict zones such as Syria. Of the 2014 international winner, James Dyson said: “James' invention shows the impact design engineering can have on people's lives. The western world takes incubators for granted – we don't think about how their inefficient design makes them unusable in developing countries and disaster zones. By bravely challenging convention, James has created something that could save thousands of lives.”
You can see Roberts explain how his invention works here.

In the long run, the internal combustion engine (ICE) is on the way out and electric motors are on the way in, but ICEs have been around for so loooong that we should be careful about announcing their demise. They're going to stick around a while longer, and so it's very important to make them as efficient and clean as possible.
Car and Driver looks at 5 fuel-saving technologies that are keeping the ICE relevant (if far from ideal). As they say, they still work on basically the same principle as they ever did, but old 4-cylinder engines produced about 20 horsepower while modern ones can generate up to 250 hp while being cleaner and burning less gas. Read on for more details on the 5 fuel-saving technologies: Clean diesel, direct injection, cylinder deactivation, turbochargers, and variable valve timing and lift.Clean Diesel
Various advances such as the availability of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, better catalysts and particulate matter traps, better control over combustion are making diesel engines cleaner, so you can expect a new wave of diesel passenger vehicles to come to the US in the next few years.
Diesel engines are certainly far from perfect, but they have inherently better thermal efficiency than gasoline engines, and they are usually more durable (if also more expensive and heavier). Another benefit is that they can run on biodiesel, which if you can find fuel made from waste cooking oil or (in the next few years) from algae can be very green.
Before direct injection, the fuel was mixed with air in the car's intake manifold. Now, with direct injection, the fuel is mixed with air inside the cylinder, allowing for better control over the amount of fuel used, and variations depending on demand (acceleration vs. cruising). This makes the engine more fuel efficient.
Cylinder Deactivation
The name says it all. ICEs with this feature can simply deactivate some cylinders when less power is required, temporarily reducing the total volume of the engine cylinders and so burning less fuel. This feature is found on V6 and V8 engines.
Turbochargers
Turbochargers increase the pressure inside cylinders, cramming more air and allowing combustion to generate more power. This doesn't make the engine more economical in itself, but since a smaller displacement engine can generate more peak power, you can more easily downsize and save there.
Valves open and close to allow air and fuel to enter cylinders and for the products of combustion to exit. Different valve timings produce different results (more power, better fuel economy). Traditionally, you couldn't vary that timing, so the choice had to be made once when the engine was designed. But many modern engines can vary valve timing, allowing for example the default low RPM range of the engine to have more economical timing, and the higher RPM range to go for max power. This allows a smaller displacement engine to produce more peak power, so it allows for downsizing and fuel savings.
One Big Problem With All of This
The problem is that most of the gains from these technological breakthroughs have been used to increase power instead of reducing fuel consumption. At best, fuel economy stayed the same while power increased.
Now that environmental awareness is increasing, that global warming is on everybody's mind and that oil is very expensive, we can hope that carmakers will end the horsepower arms race and finally use these technologies to truly make more efficient cars.
All the technologies listed above (and more, like Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition ) could be useful for longer than we think. If series plug-in hybrids like the GM Volt become popular and battery-only electric cars (or hypercapacitors ) take a while to mature fully and come down in price, many cars could still have an ICE as a range-extending generator that only kicks in when the batteries are low. The more efficient and clean these are, the better.

There is healthy competition in sports, and then there's kicking someone directly in the biscuits.
These are two mutually exclusive things. This Venn diagram does not cross.
For this reason, referees could not allow FIU big man Adrian Diaz to finish out Wednesday's second-round Conference USA tournament game against UTEP.
Article continues below ...
As Deadspin's Tom Ley notes, Diaz broke a cardinal rule of sport with 1:30 remaining in the second half. He got mad at an opponent (alright), and then kicked said opponent repeatedly in the blintzes (very not alright).
Diaz was hit with a flagrant two and ejected from the game. The Panthers lost 85-87.
Don't kick people in the groin multiple times, guys. Don't kick anyone in the groin any amount of times. It's unneighborly at best.

A tumor-suppressing protein snatches up an important cancer-promoting enzyme and tags it with molecules that condemn it to destruction, a research team led by scientists at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center reports this week in the journal Molecular Cell.
"KEAP1 is a recently discovered tumor suppressor, but how it works has not been known. IKKß is a known oncoprotein that promotes cancer in at least two different ways, but we did not know how it was regulated. We think we've answered both questions with this research," said senior author Mien-Chie Hung, Ph.D., chair and professor of M. D. Anderson's Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology.
The researchers showed that KEAP1, short for the tongue-twisting Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, binds to IKKß and attaches molecules known as ubiquitins to the oncoprotein, which targets it for dissolution by the cell's proteasome complex.
They also showed that underexpression of KEAP1 is associated with poor survival among breast cancer patients, and that it's mutated and inactivated in some breast, liver, lung and colon tumors.
"KEAP1 underexpression or inactivation is involved in multiple cancers, so we are working now to identify its activation mechanism, which could lead to development of new anti-cancer drugs," Hung said. He and his colleagues also want to know whether KEAP1 works on other known oncoproteins.
Blocking overexpression of IKKß, short for IkB kinase ß, is crucial for at least two reasons. Hung and colleagues have shown that the protein inhibits at least two other important tumor suppressors. More importantly, IKKß activates the NF?B (nuclear factor ?b) signaling pathway, which regulates expression of genes involved in the immune response, cellular proliferation, growth of new blood vessels, cell survival, tumor invasion, and the lethal spreading of cancer known as metastasis.
Hung and colleagues first demonstrated that the presence of KEAP1 inhibits the NF?B signaling pathway and then conducted a series of experiments to find out how that happens. They found that depletion of KEAP1 leads to the accumulation of IKKß, and then discovered that the tumor suppressor binds to a specific site on IKKß, capturing it to feed it to the proteasome.
Hung likens this snatching of IKKß to plucking stuffed animals with a mechanical claw out of an arcade game, imagery that wound up on the cover of Molecular Cell.
KEAP1 is a ubiquitin ligase that attaches to the target protein and works in a complex with another protein, CUL3, that connects the ubiquitins to the bound protein.
The team analyzed both KEAP1 and CUL3 expression in the tumors of 119 breast cancer patients and correlated the findings to overall survival. They found that underexpression of KEAP1 alone was associated with poor survival. Patients with strong expression of both KEAP1 and CUL3 had an 80 percent survival rate at five years while those with little expression of either had a 43 percent 5-year survival rate.
Next, they sequenced KEAP1's genes in 26 cancer lines (18 breasts, four liver, four lung) and in 119 primary tumors (17 breasts, 78 liver, 13 lungs, 11 colon) and found two functional genetic mutations that shut down the protein's ability regulate IKKß. The mutations affected the portion of the protein that binds to IKKß.
The research in this paper was funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute, including M. D. Anderson's Specialized Program in Research Excellence (SPORE) grants in breast, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Kadoorie Charitable Foundations, Patel Memorial Breast Cancer Endowment Fund, the National Breast Cancer Foundation, and by the Taiwan National Science Council.
Hung noted that first author Dung-Fang Lee, Ph.D., led his lab's research on IKKß as a doctoral candidate in The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at Houston, a joint program of M. D. Anderson and The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Lee received the GSBS Alfred Knudson Jr. Outstanding Dissertation Award when he graduated last year. Lee is now a postdoctoral fellow at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

A spokesman for the University of Wisconsin-Madison has shrugged off concerns over one of its students selling hoodies bearing the phrase “All White People Are Racist” in capital letters.
“In this case, the individuals involved are exercising their rights to free speech and engaging in a private activity unrelated to their status as students,” campus spokesman John Lucas said in an email to The College Fix.
Asked a second time to weigh in on the matter, Lucas gave the same answer.
The hoodies are the brainchild of an entrepreneurial UW-Madison undergraduate who recently began selling sweatshirts online—in Wisconsin red—which proclaim: “All White People Are Racist.”

Other sweatshirts offered by the same UW student vendor read, “If I Encounter Another Cop With A God Complex I'm Going To Have To Show The World That They Are Human,” modeled by a woman in a hijab and begging the question of how she proposes to prove police officers' humanity.
The student designer has sold dozens of sweatshirts, including his newest design, which has the “All White People Are Racist” logo on the front and bloody handprints on each sleeve. He was recently featured in a UW student newspaper article modeling his designs right in the heart of campus, not twenty yards from the entrance to the main administrative offices atop Bascom Hill.

Seeking comment on the matter, The College Fix contacted Chancellor Rebecca Blank, Dean of Students Lori Berquam, and Vice Provost for Diversity and Climate Patrick Sims, who have been vocal supporters of Black Lives Matter and who have worked closely with Black Lives Matter in campus programming.
In keeping with the university's active demonization of its white students, singling them out for privilege-shaming “education sessions,” not one of these three UW administrators accepted The Fix's invitation — sent twice — to denounce the message of racial hatred and possible calls for anti-police violence printed on the sweatshirts.
The student entrepreneur has told news outlets he simply wanted to “start a conversation” and make people feel “uncomfortable” with his wares and that he has received both death threats and positive responses.
He majors in elementary education at the University of Wisconsin School of Education. As such, and according to the elementary education program's website, he will “Study teaching methods and gain experience in schools through supervised field placements during [his] four-semester professional sequence.”
The Fix reached out to the dean of the School of Education, Diana Hess, to inquire as to whether the undergraduate selling the sweatshirts demonizing other races and apparently calling for violence against police officers would be placed in a classroom setting teaching young children. Dean Hess did not reply. (Ironically, Hess was hired by the UW School of Education because she wrote a book about why and how teachers should “ensure that all sides of a controversy are presented fairly” in a classroom.)
Perhaps Dean Hess' and the three UW administrators' reticence to comment on the matter is explained by the fact that the sweatshirts hardly express sentiments out of keeping with those of the university faculty, administration and staff as a whole. “White privilege” lecturing has become a regular feature of all aspects of university life.
The Geography Department, for example, showcases the scholarship of USC Professor Laura Pulido, who argues that “white privilege” is responsible for “environmental injustice,” including environmental racism. The History Department recently sent out a blast e-mail exhorting all affiliated students and faculty to attend an upcoming lecture titled “How History Keeps Us Racist – and what to do about it.” The History Department also gained national notoriety in 2013 for its mandatory diversity training, during which participants were given handouts on the “re-education process” needed for white people (and only white people) to overcome their “thorough racist conditioning.”
Moreover, the University of Wisconsin system funneled taxpayer money into the pockets of the national White Privilege Conference organizers when that conference was held in Madison in 2014. Teachers who attended the event vowed to bring the lessons of the White Privilege Conference into their classrooms—precisely what the UW School of Education seems to be encouraging its undergraduates to do.
The UW system has also hosted extended “white privilege” campaigns advertised by posters featuring white models with racial slogans written on their faces.
Given this ongoing leadership in the “white privilege” movement now fully entrenched at universities nationwide, it is hardly surprising that the UW administration—which has been telling its students for years that all white people are racist—has declined to condemn a student who simply decided to print that slogan on articles of clothing.
UW spokesman John Lucas refused to provide guidelines as to whether the university would tolerate students selling sweatshirts making blanket generalizations about other ethnicities.

The Islamic State reportedly seized a cannabis field from the Free Syrian Army on Tuesday. A video posted on YouTube by a group called “a3maq news” shows militants from the extremist group walking through the field in Aleppo province in northern Syria and setting fire to some of the plants.
The video shows several men in the field holding weapons and talking about the marijuana plants. Some men begin to chop off huge bushels and place them in neatly stacked piles that are then doused in gasoline and set aflame.
The YouTube channel appears to focus on news about ISIS in Aleppo. Also on Tuesday, the group posted a video showing the militants' capture of a huge arsenal near the city. Some of the weapons shown, including a M198 Howitzer cannon, are U.S.-made. Several Twitter accounts associated with the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, shared the video.

Rebel groups have destroyed marijuana fields in Syria before, claiming that using the drug is banned under the Islamic law. In that respect, ISIS is no different. The militant group operates under the strictest interpretation of Sharia and imposes a severe ban on things deemed haram (sinful) wherever they go. Earlier this summer, ISIS burned a large pile of cigarettes in Iraq, in order to enforce a ban on smoking, a longtime target for the group. In November, the group said it burned at least 1.5 million packs of cigarettes in Syria.
ISIS has suddenly become the richest and most alarming extremist force in the region. Under their strict interpretation of the law, the marijuana field should be destroyed. But the video actually shows only a small bushel being set on fire, not the entire crop. Given that the militants are interested in seizing as many of a country's resources as they can (the Mosul Dam, several oil fields, an airport…) it's unlikely that they would eliminate the possibility of financial gain from the marijuana.
The marijuana business in Syria has been booming since the start of the civil war in 2011, and much of the country's supply is sold to neighboring Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Israel. In July, World Crunch reported that cannabis had become a major means of financial gains for Syrian rebel groups, namely those in the Syria Revolutionaries Front, a coalition of Free Syrian Army-affiliated brigades. Fearing the more extremist groups, like Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS, cannabis farmers would pay FSA fighters to protect their fields and ensure the goods would safely cross the border. FSA fighters, according to the report, used the money to buy weapons.
ISIS has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria in the past few months and their brutal methods are not exactly in line with marijuana's "chill" reputation. Perhaps the militants should indulge in a little puff, puff, pass.
Sen. Lindsey Graham is fresh off a successful reelection and has plans, big plans, for the Republican Party. He won't have to worry about irritating the right flank of his party for years. He's free to talk up certain RINO issues of importance to him. Among these issues is climate change.
The Republican Party, with a handful of exceptions, does not believe that man-made climate change exists. It's difficult for Congress to achieve a bipartisan accord to combat man-made climate change when one of the two parties denies the existence of man-made climate change. Some would say it makes it impossible. You know? Why would the Republican Party pass a bill to combat something it perceives as an elaborate laser show orchestrated by Al Gore and "greedy scientists"?

Lindsey Graham believes in man-made climate change. Well, sometimes. It depends on the election calendar. In 2009-2010, Graham worked with Sens. John Kerry and Joe Lieberman on a cap-and-trade bill. Once he realized that the issue has zero support within his party, though, he withdrew support from his own proposal and somehow blamed Harry Reid.
Now he's back on the wagon, Roll Call reports. He's talking up the need for the GOP to develop an "environmental policy" ahead of 2016, when the electorate will include more young voters who have a long-term stake in ensuring Planet Earth isn't completely destroyed:
Senate Republicans were swept into power vowing to fight the White House's “war on coal,” but at least one says they need a broader message than “no” in 2016. “I think there will be a political problem for the Republican Party going into 2016 if we don't define what we are for on the environment,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. “I don't know what the environmental policy of the Republican Party is.” Graham, who worked on a climate change proposal in 2010 with Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., suggested that what worked in the midterms might not work the next time around.
Graham doesn't give his party enough credit here. The Republican party has a fairly strong environmental policy: burn it down! Down down, into the ground, and then burn the ground too.
The incoming Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, just won reelection by harping on President Obama's "War on Coal." When Obama announced his new climate accord with China after the election, McConnell and the rest of his party ran around with their heads on fire. The EPA is set to unveil a host of new regulations over the next couple of months. Even if the Republican party were to let the administration's upcoming action on immigration slide -- it won't -- funding for the EPA would present its own shutdown threat(s) over the next year.
And then let's consider the incoming chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe considers climate change to be a great hoax -- nay, the greatest hoax. We know this because he wrote a book a couple of years ago called "The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future." He believes climate change is the invention of the United Nations, designed to "shut down the machine called America." This is the sort of guy Jim Inhofe is. He's the sort of guy who builds an igloo with his grandchildren in a snowstorm and affixes a sign to it reading, "AL GORE'S NEW HOME." Because a snowstorm disproves the existence of climate change, etc.
Even Graham, in this same interview where he's talking about the need for the party to come up with a climate change plan, can't resist taking a shot at Al Gore.

Graham said he understands why many Republicans see the issue as more political than substantive, but he is urging the GOP to take the issue on rather than cede it to Democrats. “Al Gore has made this into a religion; I can understand why people rebel against it, but to me it's not enough to say that you think they are all wet when it comes to climate change,” said Graham, who easily won his re-election after facing a tea party challenger this year in the GOP primary. “The Republican Party needs to define what are you for.”
The process by which the Republican Party will define what it's for ahead of 2016, with regards to the environment and everything else, will be the Republican presidential primary season. And all incentives suggest that the definition around which candidates will coalesce is "eliminate the EPA." This will likely become Graham's position, too, as he tries not to meddle with official party messaging.
A Muslim woman at the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's rally in Ballia on Tuesday was seen removing her burqa on police orders.
In a video posted by ANI, the woman is seen taking off her full-covered Islamic veil after being asked by a lady police officer.
The woman, who is a BJP worker, did not know why she was asked to remove the burqa, according to a Zee News report.
However, the district police chief said they were not informed about the incident and will look closely into the matter.
"I have not been informed of any incident where a woman was asked to take off her burqa. However, everyone had the instructions to see that no one shows black cloth to Yogi ji. Whatever you are mentioning will be probed and action will be taken," said Anil Kumar, Balia SP.

The incident happened three days after black flags were waved in UP Chief Minister's Meerut's rally ahead of local bodies' election.
Earlier, black coloured t-shirts and shirts were banned in a CM's rally. The district administration did not allow anyone wearing black T-shirts in an attempt to stop black flags being raised
Meanwhile, the local bodies' election in Uttar Pradesh's 24 districts is underway. The polling will be done in three phase - November 22, November 26 and November 29.
A Chinese man and his four-year-old son are apparently stuck in South Korea because his son used his old man's passport as a drawing book. Seriously. While on vacation, the kid started doodling over his Dad's passport, decorating it with human-ish and animal-ish figures, a lot of scribbles and some added flair. Cute!
And look, the boy even added a beard and accentuated some features on his dad's face! This kid's going to be a star, if he can ever make it home. Metro UK says that the dad is now stuck in South Korea now because of "unrecognizable documentation" and that it's unlikely he'll be able to travel back home to China as originally scheduled.

At least the kid will have other pages in the Passport to draw on, right?

YOKOHAMA, Japan, Nov 21, 2012 - Japanese nuclear reactor maker Toshiba on Wednesday unveiled a remote-controlled robot resembling a headless dog that they hope will be used at the battered Fukushima power plant.
The tetrapod, which weighs 65 kilograms (143 pounds) and is about one metre (3 foot, four inches) tall, is designed to be able to cover difficult terrain - such as going up steep steps - that regular robots struggle with.
The robot's triple-jointed legs are designed to give it maximum flexibility, with engineers saying it will be able to go into spaces where high radiation makes it impossible for workers to do so.
The robot can carry a load of 20 kilograms and is equipped with cameras and a radiation meter, expected to help workers decide which parts of buildings are safe to enter and for how long.

The machine can also carry a small wired vehicle equipped with a camera and send it out to crawl into small spaces to carry out inspections.
Toshiba engineer Goro Yanase said the as-yet unnamed robot could be upgraded to carry more than 80 kilograms, climb ladders and step over obstacles up to 50 centimetres (20 inches) high.
Robots have already been used inside the wrecked plant to take video footage, including the US-made PackBot and Japanese-made Quince crawler robots, but Toshiba is awaiting the go ahead from plant operator TEPCO to deploy its creation.
The massive earthquake and tsunami of March 11 last year sparked an atomic emergency at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the northeast of the country.
Efforts to clear up after the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986 are still continuing, with high levels of radiation hampering operations.
The decommissioning of the crippled plant is expected to take several decades.

Poništeno rješenje za izgradnju vjetroelektrane na Pelješcu
Upravni sud u Splitu usvojio je tužbu Udruge BIOM kojom se poništava rješenje Ministarstva zaštite okoliša i prirode o prihvatljivosti izgradnje vjetroelektrane „Bila Ploča“ na Pelješcu. Ovo je prva takva presuda koja zaustavlja izgradnju vjetroelektrane na području očuvanja značajnim za zaštitu ptica u Hrvatskoj ustvrdivši da je studija utjecaj na okoliš bila stručno neutemeljena. Udruga BIOM već godinama upozorava na nestručno izrađene studije te na nepravilnosti u postupcima procjene utjecaja na okoliš i na ekološku mrežu Natura 2000.
U ponedjeljak, 28.12.2015., sutkinja Miranda Gulišija Jurišić pri Upravnom sudu u Splitu donijela je presudu u korist tužitelja, Udruge BIOM i Hrvatskog društva za zaštitu ptica i prirode. Udruga BIOM je podigla tužbu još u veljači 2013. nakon što je Ministarstvo zaštite okoliša i prirode donijelo rješenje kojim se izgradnja vjetroelektrana Bila Ploča ocijenila prihvatljivom za okoliš i ekološku mrežu, iako se područje zahvata nalazilo na važnom koridoru preleta ptica.
„Već za vrijeme javne rasprave upozoravali smo na stručnu neutemeljenost studije te na apsurdnu situaciju da se planira izgradnja vjetroelektrane na području koje su državne institucije za zaštitu prirode identificirale kao međunarodno značajno za zaštitu ptica. Prostorno loše pozicionirane vjetroelektrane mogu izazvati visoku smrtnost kod ptica i šišmiša koji stradaju uslijed sudara s elisama vjetroturbina“ rekao je dipl. ing. biologije Vedran Lucić iz Udruge BIOM.
Međutim, ni većina članova stručno-savjetodavnog povjerenstva niti tadašnje Ministarstvo zaštite okoliša nisu vidjeli prepreku odobriti izgradnju vjetroelektrane na prijevoju iznad Orebića preko kojeg prelijeće veliki broj ugroženih vrsta ptica kao npr. eja močvarica, orao zmijar i škanjac osaš.
„Stručno neutemeljene studije su česte jer su posljedica direktnog ugovaranja između investitora zahvata i izvođača studije utjecaja, tzv. ovlaštenika. Ovlaštenici zbog tržišne konkurencije podilaze investitoru tako da studije velikom većinom odobravaju zahvat umjesto da ga objektivno i kritički razmotre. Nadležno Ministarstvo, umjesto da zaustavi ovu lošu praksu, tolerira ovaj način djelovanja na štetu ugroženih vrsta i staništa u Hrvatskoj“, zaključuju u Udruzi BIOM.
Nažalost, ovo nije jedini spor koji Udruga BIOM vodi pred Upravnim sudovima u Hrvatskoj. Trenutno su još tri tužbe aktivne koje osporavaju izgradnju vjetroelektrana na širem području Velebita i Dinare, također na područjima značajnim za zaštitu ptica!

Hopes of Dale Steyn's availability for the Bangladesh Test series have been dashed after the seamer ruled himself out of the opening round of first-class fixtures next week. Steyn was planning to make his comeback for the Titans' match against the Dolphins on Tuesday but has decided the load of a four-day match is too much for someone who has been out of action since last November.
"I've decided not to play right now. I'm bowling fine but I haven't hit the full workload I'd need to handle four-day cricket or a Test so I decided it was best not to play," Steyn told ESPNcricinfo on Thursday.
Steyn's reluctance to rush back is mostly because he is mindful of breaking down again - as he did in Perth when he broke the bone in his shoulder that sidelined him - and leaving the team without sufficient resources. Instead, he will target shorter formats for now. "Playing the four-day game would have given me a chance for selection in the Tests but I don't want to put myself or the team in a position where I pull up again. Some shorter cricket might be the better answer for a reintroduction."
JP Duminy will not play for the Cobras in the opening round of first-class matches, increasing speculation that his Test retirement is high. No reason was given for Duminy sitting out the match, and he has been part of the Cobras' pre-season training in Oudtshoorn, it appears Duminy may have accepted his long-form days are over. Duminy was dropped after the Lord's Test in July and send home midway through the England tour and captain Faf du Plessis made it clear Duminy will need to find form if he is to return.
The only franchise cricket for next month, before the limited-overs games against Bangladesh, are the first-class games. Steyn is considering playing at a lower level to get some overs in the legs. "I might just play some club stuff in Pretoria or Cape Town. It doesn't really matter to me at what level it is, I just need some cricket and I thought going from nothing to possibly bowling 30+ overs was a bit of a risk. It sucks, but I want to play for a few more years, not just till then end of October.
"It's been a frustrating time, but I want to play for a few more years and I'm confident I will. The longer stuff is too much right now, so we wait for possibly the white ball to come around."
Even if Steyn does not manage to find full fitness by the time the three ODIs and two T20s are played, he will be part of the inaugural Global T20, which starts on November 3. Steyn has been acquired by Cape Town Knight Riders where coach Jacques Kallis is confident he will be able to make use of Steyn throughout the tournament.
"Having chosen him for the Knight Riders, I've kept a close eye on him. I was under a little bit of pressure from the owners asking 'Are you sure?' He's busy bowling seven overs a day at the moment, and doesn't want to go into a four day game upfront. He's worried about bowling 18 overs in a day, so I think he just wants to ease into it a little bit more and make sure he's 100% fit," Kallis said, at an event in Johannesburg earlier in the week.
"It's a very mature decision he's made and I think he will still have a massive impact this season. When he's fully fit he's as dangerous as any bowler in the world and he will be 100% at some stage. I know he's as hungry as ever, he's hungry to achieve and he will normally always find a way to do that."
Without Steyn, South Africa's Test attack for Bangladesh will likely be the same as the one that played in England with Morne Morkel, Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander - who will play for the Cobras next week - the first choices, and Chris Morris and Duanne Olivier in reserve. The Test squad will be named after the opening round of matches, which concludes on Friday.
French police have eliminated an illegal Bitcoin trading network worth 200,000 euro (about $272,000) in a first operation to bust a virtual money exchange in Europe, authorities revealed Monday.
Two people have been detained and placed under investigation following raids last week in the southern French cities of Nice, Cannes and Toulouse, and in Brussels, Belgium, that also resulted in the seizure of 388 bitcoins, AFP reports.
During the raid on one of the suspects' homes, police seized a portfolio of bitcoins worth some 9,000 euros per unit and also credit cards and computer hardware.
“It's the first time in Europe that a judicial action has resulted in the closure of an illegal exchange for virtual currency,” Olivier Caracotch, prosecutor in the southwestern town of Foix where the investigation started, told Reuters. “It's also the first time in France that bitcoins have been seized as part of a judicial procedure.”
According to the official, police were informed about the platform's existence by a retired policeman who bought bitcoins on the site.
The suspects – a Tunisian, 27, who ran the website trading in bitcoins, and his suspected accomplice, a 36-year-old Frenchman – are in custody. They are being investigated over alleged involvement in illegal banking, money laundering and, also, illegally operating a gambling website.
The website – which illegally sold and lent crypto-currency to its users – had been used for at least 2,750 transactions with at least 2,500 bitcoins – between November 2013 and July 2014, according to Radio France international (RFi).
Under French law, platforms that exchange bitcoins and euros have to be approved by the ACPR, the country's financial watchdog. However, police discovered that the website operated by the suspects had not been authorized.
My 12-year-old stepson, Lewis, whose favorite band is Green Day, had never heard Pink Floyd before. I'm not sure how he's managed this — his grandfather plays in a Pink Floyd tribute band for goodness sake. So I thought we could sit down one rainy evening, have him listen hard to 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon and pass the verdict of a new generation on one of the most iconic albums of the 20th century.
It was an auspicious beginning; when he was informed the album would be 45 minutes long, he responded, "Forty-five minutes?! Are there like 20 songs on it?" I replied that no, there were nine, and he seemed genuinely horrified. I think the days of listening to an album in order, all the way through, might be on their way out. Then when the album started, he kept turning it up because he didn't understand why the album started out silent.

James T. Hodgkinson, the gunman in last week's anti-Republican shooting at a baseball field in Alexandria, Va., visited Bernie Sanders' office before the shooting.
The Associated Press reports that Hodgkinson visited Sen. Sanders' office and “was in email contact with the two Democratic senators from his home state.”
The gunman's home state was Illinois, meaning the two Democratic senators he was in email contact with were Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin.
Sanders previously condemned Hodgkinson when he learned he had volunteered on his campaign for president.

The FBI also announced Wednesdayday that it will treat the shooting as an “assault,” and not terrorism, despite the man's obvious political leanings, such as belonging to a group on Facebook called “Terminate The Republican Party” and carrying a list of names of House Freedom Caucus members on his person during the shooting.

Malcolm X on education. Malcolm X is a fascinating person to approach as an educational thinker – not because he was an academic or had any scholastic achievements but as an example of what can be achieved by someone engages in ‘homemade' or self-education.

Malcolm X (1925 – 1965) was born as Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925. His father was a Baptist minister and a strong devotee of the Black leader Marcus Garvey. Garvey's message, as many readers will be familiar, was that Black people in America would never be able to live in peace and harmony with white Americans and their only hope of salvation was to move as a people back to their roots in Africa. Malcolm's father died when he was six and his mother was put in a mental home when he was about twelve. As a result, his many brothers and sisters were split up and put into different foster homes.
Malcolm left school early and eventually drifted North and finally settled in Harlem, New York, on his own, at the age of 17.
In Harlem, he soon slipped into a life of crime. He became involved in hustling, in prostitution, in drug dealing. He became a cocaine addict and a burglar. Finally, at the ripe old age of 19, he was arrested and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.
It was while he was in prison that his whole life changed. He first learned of the existence of the Honourable Elijah Mohammed and of the movement known as the Black Muslims from his brothers and sisters outside the prison. They had become converts to the movement and asked Malcolm to write to Elijah Mohammed. In Chapter 11 of his autobiography, Malcolm writes that “at least twenty-five times I must have written that first one-page letter to him, over and over. I was trying to make it both legible and understandable. I practically couldn't read my handwriting myself; it shames me even to remember it. My spelling and my grammar were as bad, if not worse”. This chapter in his autobiography is extremely moving as it documents a man's desperate pursuit of an education.
Homemade education
Malcolm became a letter writer and as a result he says that he “stumbled upon starting to acquire some kind of homemade education”. He became extremely frustrated at not being able to express what he wanted to convey in letters that he wrote. He says that “in the street I had been the most articulate hustler out there … But now, trying to write simple English, I not only wasn't articulate, I wasn't even functional”. His ability to read books was severely hampered. “Every book I picked up had few sentences which didn't contain anywhere from one to nearly all of the words that might have been in Chinese”. He skipped the words he didn't know and so had little idea of what the books said.
He got himself a dictionary and began painstakingly copying every entry. It took him a day to do the first page. He would copy it all out and then read back aloud what he had written. He began to remember the words and what they meant. He was fascinated with the knowledge that he was gaining. He finished the A's and went on to the B's. Over a period of time he finished copying out the whole dictionary. Malcolm regarded the dictionary as a miniature encyclopedia. He learned about people and animals, about places and history, philosophy and science.
As his word base broadened, he found that he could pick up a book “and now begin to understand what the book was saying”. He says that “from then until I left that prison, in every free moment I had, if I was not reading in the library, I was reading in my bunk. You couldn't have gotten me out of a book with a wedge”.
He preferred to read in his cell but one of the problems he had was that at 10 o'clock each night when ‘lights out' was called he found that it always seemed to coincide with him in the middle of something engrossing. Fortunately, there was a light on the landing outside his particular cell and once his eyes got accustomed to the glow, he was able to sit on the floor by the cell door and continue his reading. He found that the guards would come around once every hour so that when he heard their footsteps approaching, he would rush back to his bunk until they had gone past and pretend to be asleep. As soon as they had gone, he would be back by the door reading. This would continue until three or four every morning. He says that “three or four hours of sleep a night was enough for me. Often in the years in the streets I had slept less than that”.
Malcolm read and read and read. He devoured books on history and was astounded at the knowledge he obtained about the history of black civilizations throughout the world. He read books by Gandhi on the struggle in India, he read about African colonization and China's Opium Wars. He found within the library's collection some bound pamphlets of the Abolitionist Anti-Slavery Society and was able to read for himself descriptions of atrocities committed against the slaves and of the degradations suffered by his forbears. “I never will forget how shocked I was when I began reading about slavery's total horror … Book after book showed me how the white man had brought upon the world's black, brown, red and yellow peoples every variety of the sufferings of exploitation”. His reading was not limited to history, however. He read about genetics and philosophy. He read about religion.
He relates that “ten guards and the warden couldn't have torn me out of those books … I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there in prison that reading had changed forever the course of my life”.
Conclusion
Malcolm went on to become a major figure in the fight against racism in the United States. He became a dynamic spokesman for the Black Muslims. He was feared by many, he was respected by many.
He never stopped wanting to learn. Just before his death in 1965, he maintained that one of the things he most regretted in his life was his lack of an academic education. He stated that he would be quite willing to go back to school and continue where he had left off and go on to take a degree. “I would just like to study. I mean ranging study, because I have a wide-open mind. I'm interested in almost any subject you can mention”.
When he left the Black Muslims and formed his own organization, one of the roles he performed was that of a teacher. He ran a regular class for young people where he told them “We have got to get over the brainwashing we had … get out of your mind what the man put in it … Read everything. You never know where you're going to get an idea. We have to learn how to think …”

PARO is a therapeutic robot baby harp seal, intended to be very cute and to have a calming effect on and elicit emotional responses in patients of hospitals and nursing homes, similar to animal-assisted therapy except using robots
History [ edit ]
Paro was designed by Takanori Shibata of the Intelligent System Research Institute of Japan's AIST beginning in 1993. It was first exhibited to the public in late 2001, costing US$15 million to develop, and became a "Best of COMDEX" finalist in 2003,[1] and handmade versions have been sold commercially by Shibata's company Intelligent System Co. since 2004.[2] Paro is based on harp seals Shibata saw in an ice field in northeastern Canada, where he also recorded their cries in order to use them for Paro's simulated cries.[3][4] Paro was classified as a Class 2 medical device by U.S. regulators in fall 2009.[2]
Paro has been used primarily in care facilities, especially as a form of therapy for dementia patients.[5] After a study was conducted to see the effects of robots on children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, it appeared that there are numerous benefits. The robots were able to analyze the specifics of the disorder and then intervened by creating controlled environments that assisted in reducing the anxiety that can result from the disorder (2016). This also benefits children as the robots are social companions for those interacting with it. The study found that as a result of the robots, “encouraging effects such as increased engagement, increased levels of attention and novel social behaviours, for example joint attention and imitation were found, when the children interact with robots” (Huijnen, 2016, p. 2010). The robots had roles of a playmate, social actor, therapist and contained the ability to behave as humans (2016). Huijnen, C. A. G. J., Lexis, Monique A. S., Jansens, Rianne, & De Witte, Luc P. (2016). Mapping robots to therapy and educational objectives for children with autism spectrum disorder. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 46(6), 2100-2114.
Description [ edit ]
Paro is outfitted with dual 32-bit processors, three microphones, twelve tactile sensors covering its fur, touch-sensitive whiskers, and a delicate system of motors and actuators that silently move its limbs and body.[2] The robot responds to petting by moving its tail and opening and closing its eyes. Shibata designed it to actively seek out eye contact, respond to touch, cuddle with people, remember faces, and learn actions that generate a favorable reaction. He argues,
Just like animals used in pet therapy, Paro can help relieve depression and anxiety—but it never needs to be fed and doesn't die.[4]
Paro also responds to sounds and can learn names, including its own. It produces sounds similar to a real baby seal and, unlike a real baby seal, is programmed to be active during the day and to sleep at night.[4]
On June 7, 2018, Dr Takanori Shibata holding his creation PARO, a robot therapy device.
Ethical concerns [ edit ]
Dr. Bill Thomas, founder of the Green House Project which aims to replace long-term care at nursing homes with small, home-like environments where people can live full and interactive lives, raised concerns over whether it was humane to entrust the task of emotional support for human beings to robots.[2] Sherry Turkle, the director of MIT's Initiative on Technology and the Self, argued that robots like Paro provide an illusion of a relationship, and those who find human relationships challenging may turn to robots for companionship instead.[4][6]
In popular culture [ edit ]
In The Simpsons episode "Replaceable You", Bart Simpson and Martin Prince created robotic baby seals which they named "Robopets". These were essentially Paro robots which were designed to make the old people in Springfield Retirement Castle happier.[7]
Paro is featured in "Old People," the eighth episode of the first season of Aziz Ansari's Netflix show, Master of None.

The way we approach card balance in Clash Royale is a combination of playtesting and looking at the stats - in particular, card use rates and win rates. You can expect monthly balance changes to keep gameplay fine tuned and as fun as possible.
In this round of balance changes we're taking a look at the Ice Spirit, Ice Golem, Rage and Inferno Tower.
Ice Spirit: Freeze duration decreased to 1.5sec (from 2sec)
Currently highly used at the top, Ice Spirit offers a bit too much stopping power for 1 Elixir.
Ice Golem: Death Damage increased by 74%
This change ensures that Ice Golem's Death Damage kills Skeletons (at the Tournament Rules card levels).
Rage: Effect increased to 35% (from 30%)
Rage can be a really fun and impactful spell when it makes an appearance in the Arena, but currently it isn't seeing much usage. Increasing the effect should make it a more compelling choice.
Lumberjack: Rage effect increased to 35% (from 30%)
For consistency with the Rage spell changes above.
Inferno Tower: Hitpoints decreased by 6%
Inferno Tower is currently one of the top defensive choices and as a result the "big guys" (Golem, etc.) become less appealing to use. Additionally, it can sometimes be hard to efficiently remove from the Arena, so we're aiming to remedy both of these things with a small Hitpoint reduction.

GLENDALE (WITI) -- The victim of a weekend house fire in Glendale has been identified as 49-year-old Steven Kleiber, a longtime Milwaukee musician.
Kleiber was the only one home at the time of the fire, around 10 p.m. on Saturday, February 8th. His body was found in the living room where the fire is believed to have started. The home is a total loss.
Kleiber played bass and toured with the Willy Porter Band. Friends described him as a prankster who was fun to be around.
"I'm just going to miss him so much because he really was a brother to me," said Willy Porter. "We were all living the dream, and that youthful exuberance and just being a tribe together. That forges a bond that, I don't think you can get that anywhere else. There's a big hole in our hearts but we're going to work to fill it with good stuff."
Porter and others are working to establish a scholarship fund for bass players at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music in Kleiber's memory.
"It would be great to have a scholarship to really memorialize Steve, but also to support the continuing of that music in the next generation of ours," said Matt Borkowski.
The conservatory says Kleiber's musicianship can live on by the contributions so others can be the driving force on bass. Those starting the scholarship say they are planning a fundraising concert this fall in Kleiber's memory.

The above is a commercial (1997) is by the De Beers cartel entitled ‘A Diamond is Forever'. Being as old as it is, and myself being even older, I listen to this and I remember with fondness that feeling which was at the time indued upon me; such nice music, silhouettes of a loving couple. With these ideas of love, of pleasing another, it isn't difficult to see how the media can shape our minds and promote certain unorthodox behaviors, one of them being the need to spend two months salary at the beginning of what is often a financially difficult time: marriage, when two persons and their wealth, debts, and financial responsibilities become as one.
Is this right to buy a diamond ring, what are the origins of this tradition, and how are they made?
Diamond Marketing, the quick and dirty – science.howstuffworks
With Valentine's Day now behind us, and having seen first hand the ensuing chaos, I am here considering other such norms which socially mandate romance, as one might a government holiday. Far from being benign, the occasion as it occurred around myself in the city prompted crisis-level lines at liquor stores, flower shops, and anywhere that cards were sold. Indeed, a hushed fervor of liquor, chocolate and rose pollen spread through everyone around me as if this were the day before, so as to be the backstory for, the television show The Walking Dead.
I even saw a man crying into his hands on a crowded subway car, his shoulders rhythmically heaving as the strange biological process of crying took him over from head, to heart, to toe. Beyond his socially constructed resolve to keep himself together, this date (February the 14th) had arrived, and so him and most everyone else stewing in the same social ether broke into a frenzy of expectations.
That something so inert and seemingly contrived can have such a profound and sometimes negative affect on us is a little bewildering, a little concerning.
Although I can see some utility in Valentine's day, that the lazier, more inept among us may be stirred to remember that they ought to be loving and charitable (in both the emotional and physical sense) toward their lover, even if only for the day. Moreover, though the image of the aforementioned crying gentleman may speak to the contrary, it also seems good that it spurs those who are shy, or who themselves are unable to think of a motive sufficient to rationalize their bridging of intent with action toward the fulfillment of their longings, the pursuit of what they desire. As this is what the good life is about, in one large respect, it seems to me to be a good thing if taken not too seriously (read, grievously).
As per the social norms and expectations of courting rituals, though Valentine's Day is often scoffed at, that of the diamond ring as a symbol of commitment and financial strength persists.
A ring seems nice, even appropriate to give to someone special as a symbol of commitment or some such sentiment. But to invest so much on what is essentially sentiment incarnate? Really? It seems awfully impractical. Why not put that money toward property, a vehicle, prospective child's savings account, or some such necessity. Excessive weddings also. Seems that money could be spent on better things, toward the end of a strong, authentic and enduring relationship.
Splitting the cost of a diamond ring seems better insofar as it is more egalitarian, but as the couple is getting married… as per the adage ‘me casa es su casa', whether both pay for it, or one partner pays for it, they both draw from their combined pool of funds. This money is like fat before a long and trying winter. It is energy which they will sustain the loving enterprise which stands before them in time like a too-tall obelisk threatening to crush them if they do not play house to the degree expected of boys and girls (or any such combination) thrust into the venture of adulthood, marriage, and potential parenthood.

Food for thought, as we move forward through life, and we move closer to others to whom there is a special and reverent connection. When our needles and theirs, to whom the tempo is compatible, come together, and over time we lead congruent grooves in the record of time, perhaps a ring is a gesture suitable to capture the romance in a material instantiation. Ought it is diamond? Expensive? These are conclusions that one would hope are apparent in the dialect of love between the two. If the object which one chooses to symbolize love is insufficient for the other, this, in my opinion, would be a red flag. If the love is good, the ring, in the larger scheme of things is inconsequential.
If the object symbolizes what is desired, what is promised, then to hold that which symbolizes above that which is symbolized is to be a fool and not merely a fool in love.
Take care,

On the last day of his legal career, Eddie Joyce packed up his desk and turned in his security badge. He said goodbye to the partners and associates, to his six-figure salary, to his Park Avenue office.
He was 34 years old. His wife was nine months pregnant. And he had just decided to give up his job as a lawyer to try to write short stories and novels. Exhilarated, anxious and uncertain, he was sure of only one thing: That he would write about the borough where he grew up.
It was the place his mind drifted to when he was on the subway in Manhattan or staring at the computer screen in his apartment in Brooklyn Heights: The island with dunes on one end and industrial waterfront on the other. The tight-knit neighborhoods filled with police officers, teachers, firefighters and secretaries. The summertime splashes in backyard swimming pools, the sweat and hustle on gritty basketball courts, the flickering candles at Sunday morning Mass.
A literary work about Staten Island? That's right. Last month, Mr. Joyce's debut, “Small Mercies,” published by Viking, arrived in bookstores around the country. The New York Times described it as “an intimate family portrait.” Richard Russo, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, hailed it as “a terrific first novel.”
Back when i started developing the final project for my book i needed a simple but reliable way to preload assets such as images or sounds. I also intended to show a nice progress bar indicating... well, the progress of the load. I finally settled on developing a somewhat short, simple but efficient class called ResourceLoader that could handle images and sounds but can easily be extended to support other media types, such as videos, or JS scripts.
Using it is pretty simple, too. You just need to do:
var rl = new ResourceLoader(printProgressBar, function() { alert('Preloading complete!'); }); rl.addResource('image.png', null, ResourceType.IMAGE); rl.addResource('music.mp3', 'audio/mp3', ResourceType.SOUND); rl.startPreloading(); function printProgressBar() { var percent = Math.floor((rl.resourcesLoaded * 100) / rl.resources.length); // Use the percent variable somewhere in your game/app. }
The complete code for resourceLoader.js is available on GitHub.
After stints at Education, Defra and the MoJ, Liz Truss says she feels at home in the Treasury – but believes her time in other departments means she knows all about ‘what people get up to'. The Chief Secretary tells John Ashmore why it's time for the Treasury to ditch the ‘box-ticking' and build a more collaborative approach across government
If Philip Hammond has developed a reputation as a gloomy, Eeyore-ish figure, the same cannot be said of his number two. We meet a month out from the first of the new Autumn Budgets and if she is feeling under pressure, Liz Truss is not letting it show. Indeed, after stints in Education, Environment and most recently the Ministry of Justice, you get the sense the former economist has landed on her feet at the Treasury.
“I love being at the Treasury, it is fantastic,” she says. “When I first went to university and did economics I had an epiphany, because I think economics is a great way of understanding the world and really, really exciting, so it's great to be at the Treasury.”
She observes that her cross-Whitehall experience is a big advantage in her current role. “I think having been at other departments is fantastic experience because when I talk to other departments I know a bit where the bodies are buried and the things people get up to.
“But I also think that the Treasury and departments should develop a more collaborative arrangement and that's what I'm working on – rather than the Treasury being a micro-manager and ticking boxes, how do we work together to make sure we're getting the best value for public money? And because I've been in government departments I do understand where my colleagues are coming from.”
While the role of Chief Secretary could be seen as the height of dour bean-counting, the South West Norfolk MP seems genuinely enthused by the challenge. At times during our interview she sounds more like a Trade Minister than Chief Secretary, repeatedly stressing the importance of letting people know how well Britain is really doing.
“What is just incredibly important now is we get the message across that Britain continues to be open for business, we continue to be the most innovative, enterprising country in the world. That's the message we need to get out not just to people in the UK but to people around the world.”
Truss argues that the wider public might not be aware of all of the developments going on in the economy. She gives the example of four companies in her own Norfolk patch who are listed on the Alternative Investment Market. “But how many people know about that? What we need to do to get the message out to people that there are opportunities with those companies, there are opportunities to set up a company yourself.
“That's I think what we need to say to the whole of Britain, but particularly to the generation coming through.”
Now on her fourth ministerial job, it's easy to forget that the 42-year-old has only been an MP since 2010. She was very much in the vanguard of a group of reform-minded new intake MPs, founding the Free Enterprise group and co-authoring two books offering a blueprint for Tory government – After the Coalition and Britannia Unchained. “First of all we wrote After the Coalition and then we got a majority government, and then we wrote Britannia Unchained and Britannia's become unchained. But I'm not predicting the future again!”
That reforming zeal is still evident from the almost evangelical way Truss describes her current role. “We spend £28,500 per household on public spending, and my absolute obsession is how are we going to make that money work much better for the public who consume services, but also for the people who work in the public sector? Because I think if we help people in the frontline have more impact then we're going to get better services but we're also going to use our budget much better. That's what I'm working on.”
Nor does she hold back when asked if she finds the Whitehall machine frustrating to deal with. “Yes, in an answer,” she says.
“I always think government has to force itself to become more nimble in the modern age. If you look at the huge changes in the way businesses operate, the delayering, much less hierarchical, much more instantaneous in the way businesses use social media, I do think government should be moving in that direction. That's the way people want to engage with government in the modern world.”
At the same time she underlines a number of innovations that are helping services become more efficient and embrace new technology. The new flood warning system, for instance, relying on the ‘internet of things' or the NHS Ask the Midwife service for expectant mothers.
For all her ebullient tone, there's no escaping the spectre of Brexit. Truss campaigned for Remain but has since become a Leave convert – and to hear her talking of the “opportunities” of leaving the EU, you would be forgiven for mistaking her for a dyed-in-the-wool eurosceptic.
She plays a predictably straight bat when asked if Theresa May is the right leader to take the Tories beyond Brexit and into the next election, while sounding a warning to feuding colleagues to get on to the day job.
“Absolutely, absolutely and you know, she's got a tough job. Brexit is a challenging thing to be doing but we need to get on with it, the country don't want to hear the Conservative party wrangling with each other, what they want to see is us taking advantage of all these opportunities that are open to us as a country.
“We've got new freedoms when we leave the EU to do things differently, which I think is really exciting and we need to paint out that future. We need to talk to people about the opportunities and not be talking about the internal politics of the Tory party, which I think's quite boring to most people.”
Much of the recent talk has been about the prospect of a ‘no deal' Brexit. While she is clear that the Treasury is preparing for all eventualities, Truss seems much more relaxed about the prospect of a WTO rules scenario, arguing that the inherent strengths of the British economy mean a prosperous future whatever the outcome of the negotiations.
“When I was in Japan and Korea people were telling me about the huge admiration for our start-up culture, how easy it is to set up a business in Britain, how exciting and creative and innovative the UK is, and we have all those strengths and we will continue to have those strengths regardless of the arrangements by which we leave Europe. It's that sense of positivity that I think it's really important to cultivate over the next few years.”
Why, then, will the government not let the public and MPs know what assessments have been made about the impact of no deal? “I've been asked all kinds of questions about the forecasts that governments have made. The fact is we build our own future, it is by the actions of businesses across the country, it's about the way we raise our performance as a country, that's what will impact the future.”
Pushed on whether there is a transparency issue with not publishing the information, she replies simply: “I personally haven't seen any such forecasts.”
We meet in a week where the treatment of women is firmly in the spotlight, with several female MPs coming forward with stories of sexual harassment. While Parliament has more women than ever, and several of them sit around the Cabinet table, Truss agrees there is still a long way to go in the battle for equality. “Yeah I do. I think that society as a whole still has some way to go and you know there are still things that hold women and girls back.
She says she is “obsessive” about getting her two young daughters interested in computer programming. But she adds that there is still work to do to unpick the sort of gender stereotypes that are holding women and girls back, and illustrates the point with the story of a recent visit to a primary school in her constituency.
“I just asked the kids ‘what do you want to do when you grow up?' and most of the boys said, first of all ‘footballer', but then they said ‘engineer' or ‘astronaut'. The girls were like ‘I want to be a hairdresser or a dancer', but none of them selected a career that was technology or enterprise.
“It's not that any of those professions are wrong, but I think that we do limit people's potential and options by the way we talk about some of these things.
“I asked the kids to put their hands up if they thought boys were better at maths, and all the boys put their hands up and some of the girls put their hands up – and that was a class of eight-year-olds. So we've still got a long way to go.”
Google plans to follow Microsoft in throwing its legal support behind Apple in its increasingly contentious dispute with the federal government around the iPhone connected with the San Bernardino terror attacks, according to sources.
At a congressional hearing on Thursday, Microsoft's legal chief, Brad Smith, said that the company plans to file an amicus brief next week in support of Apple's resistance to helping the FBI hack the phone. Google will deliver its own supporting brief “soon,” according to sources familiar with the company.
Apple's standoff with the feds is growing more heated each day. Apple filed documents in court today asking a judge to throw out the order demanding that the company assist the FBI in getting past the phone's encryption. Apple has also asked its tech peers to stand behind the company.
Google, which controls Android, the world's most popular mobile operating system, was the first tech company to publicly voice support for Apple when the case broke last week. CEO Sundar Pichai said the government demands set a “troubling precedent.”
Update: It appears that the rest of the tech community is rallying behind Apple, too. Both Twitter and Facebook are also expected to throw their legal support behind Apple next week, according to sources.
One source told Re/code that “the industry is aligned and working on a joint submission to the court.” So it appears that numerous tech companies will file one amicus brief together instead of numerous individual briefs.

full title: Hillary Clinton Works With Three Major Islamic Terror Leaders Who Want To Kill Christians And Make America Into An Islamic Country, Donald Trump Must Bring This Up In The Debates To Crush Her
Bring up Trump-Putin relations in the debates next Monday and Trump should bring up Hillarys three secret love affairs with major Muslim Brotherhood operatives while he makes the case for his complement of Putin. This will be long (7000 words), detailed and loaded with documents, translated links, packed with evidence on Hillarys affairs with Muslim Brotherhood operatives who intend to destroy us from within. It must be circulated and carefully studied.
But before we disclose all the juicy details, there is no question, the issue of Donald Trump complementing Russias President Putin will come up during the debate. If I was Trump I will remind Hillary Clinton once compared Putin with Hitler. Lets compare and see who better qualifies to win the Hitler award. Hillary is one who does not mind putting evil Hitler to good use, so long it advances another evil: Hillary.

While she was Secretary of State, Clinton conspired to suppress criticism of Islam. Clinton worked closely with Bassam Estwani, a secret Muslim Brotherhood figure. Clinton worked with Estwani and others to help the Muslim Brotherhood infiltrate the State Department and the U.S. government. Clinton worked closely with Mursi advisor Essam el-Haddad and his son Gehad el-Haddad. Both were leaders in Egypts Muslim Brotherhood apparatus and worked very closely with Clinton. Prior to working for the Mursi regime, Gehad worked for the Clinton Foundation for five years. Both men were later arrested for their criminal activities in Egypt and their roles as Muslim Brotherhood leaders. Mursis wife, Naglaa Mahmoud, collaborated with Hillary Clinton and planned to help lead violent insurrections in Egypt after her husband was removed from power. Saleha Abedin, the mother of Hillarys adviser Huma Abedin, is a close colleague of Naglaa. Huma Abedin is the daughter of a Muslim Brotherhood and Muslim Sisterhood leaders.

“The Federal government has been infiltrated at the highest levels with muzloids. By Design.” A great deal of the Muslim Brotherhood infiltration of the State Department and the U.S. government was facilitated by Hillary Clinton.

“Once the MB gains control of DC through subterfuge, the battle is over. There is no need for bombs or bullets, the battle to keep America America is over. This is the heart of the MB battle plan.” If Clinton becomes President the Muslim Brotherhood will have complete control of the U.S. government.

hillary has chosen to favor muzzards in return for their contributions and votes.
So has bammy. They don't criticize muzz's. They favor muzz's over Christians/Jews every chance they get. They do not hold muzz's to the same standards as Christians/Jews.
They know that muzzards are reproducing rapidly, and are well on their way to replacing us.
So they abandon the Christians/Jews who have become complacent and non-practicing, in favor of muzzards who are fervent.

Does not matter who wins, it matters what they do about the problem. There is no current assurance that DJT will do anything about the MB in the US government. We do know that HRC will make it far worse, however.

If Canada was hoping to make an early statement at the 2012 World sledge hockey challenge, they did so pretty emphatically.
Attempting to win their fifth tournament in six years, Canada harassed and hassled Japan to the tune of 11-0 in their opening round-robin game at WinSport Sports Complex on Sunday afternoon. In the day's first encounter, Josh Sweeney scored a short-handed goal at 2:28 of the third period which proved the decider in a 3-1 USA victory over Norway.
“We're real proud of the guys,” noted Canada's head coach Mike Mondin. “They prepared really well for tonight's game. This game is over, the guys will enjoy the win, but it's time to prepare for tomorrow.”
Canada will meet Norway at noon today, while Japan takes on the USA at 7 p.m.
On Sunday, it certainly did not take long for the hometown favourites to assert their dominance on the Markin McPhail Centre ice surface. Just 2:26 of the first period in, Marc Dorion scored while both teams had a man in the penalty box. Two minutes later and just nine seconds into a power play, Brad Bowen made it 2-0.
The onslaught would continue, with the beleaguered Mitsuru Nagase facing 11 shots in the period and allowing eight goals. Dorion, 25, finished the game with the hat trick.
“It's always my goal as a player to go out there and play to the best of my ability, try and do the right things,” Dorion explained. “I'm not known as a goal scorer, but I do go out there and contribute. I just try to work hard, try and cough up the puck to my teammates and generate some chances off of that.
“Even though we scored eight goals in the first period, there's always things we can improve on.”
Everybody seemed to get in on the scoring action for Canada, something their coach was thrilled to see.
“All three lines contributed and that was a good thing,” Mondin agreed. “It's early in the season, we have some things to work on and we've identified those.”
In his third season at the helm, Mondin also knows that, though the opener was perhaps a little too easy, things will get tougher as the week goes on, with Norway and the U.S. no slouches in the sport of sledge. In fact, the U.S. won the 2012 world championships in Norway last spring, with Canada coming home with a bronze, so there is a definite carrot at the end of this hockey stick.
“Our goal is to win the world championship; it was our goal last year and we came up a bit short, and we've learned from that,” suggested Mondin. “Going forward from this point, every day is a new learning experience and we can't get ahead of ourselves. It's an old cliché, day by day, but we have to focus on all the little things we have to master.”
Shinobu Fukishima took over in the Japanese goal in the second period, and he was able to keep the puck out but for three occasions, including Dorion's third of the game. His teammates, meanwhile, could not muster little in the way of offence on Benoit St-Amand in the Canada net. In fact, Japan finished with just two shots on goal.
VMworld 2016 is just around the corner (10 days and counting) and the theme this year is being_Tomorrow …which looks to build on the Ready for Any and Brave IT messages from the last couple of VMworld events. It's a continuation of VMware's call to arms to get themselves and their partners and customers prepared for the shift in the IT of tomorrow. This will be my fourth VMworld and I am looking forward to spending time networking with industry peers, walking around the Solutions Exchange on the lookout out for the next Rubrik or Platform9 and attending Technical Sessions.
http://www.vmworld.com/uscatalog.jspa
The Content Catalog went live a few weeks ago and the Session Builder has also been live allowing attendees to lock in sessions. There are a total of 817 sessions this year, up from the 752 sessions last year. I've listed the main tracks with the numbers fairly similar to last year.
Cloud Native Applications (17)
End-User Computing (97)
Hybrid Cloud (63)
Partner Exchange @ VMworld (74)
Software-Defined Data Center (504)
Technology Deep Dives & Futures (22)
VMware's core technology focus around VSAN and NSX again has the lions share of sessions this time year, with EUC still a very popular subject. It's pleasing to see a lot of vCloud Air Network related sessions in the list (for a detailed look at the vCAN Sessions read my previous post) and there is a solid amount of Cloud Native Application content. Below are my top picks for this year:
Virtual SAN – Day 2 Operations [ STO7534
Advanced Network Services with NSX [ NET7907
A Day in the Life of a VSAN I/O [ STO7875
vSphere 6.x Host Resource Deep Dive [ INF8430
The Architectural Future of Network Virtualization [ NET8193R
Conducting a Successful Virtual SAN 6.2 Proof of Concept [ STO7535
How to design and implement VMware's vCloud in production [ SDDC9612-SPO

Evolving the vSphere API for the Modern Era [ INF8255
Multisite Networking and Security with Cross-vCenter NSX: Part 2 [ NET7861R
My focus seems to have shifted back towards more vCloud Director and Network/Hybrid Cloud automation of late and it's reflected in the choices above. Along side that I am also very interested to see how VMware position vCloud Air after the shambles of the past 12 months and I always I look forward to hearing from respected industry technical leads Frank Denneman, Chris Wahl and Duncan Epping as they give their perspective on storage and software defined datacenters and automation. This year I'm also looking at what the SABU Tech Marketing Team are up to around VSAN and VSAN futures.
As has also become tradition, there are a bunch of bloggers who put out their Top picks for VMworld…check out the links below for more insight into what's going to be hot in Las Vegas this VMworld. Hope to catch up with as many community folk as possible while over so if you are interested in a chat, hit me up!

After a couple of decades of running startups, Australian entrepreneur Adam Jacoby began to think about a new challenge: democracy. Could politics become fairer and more inclusive if he thought about democracy as a product of his newest venture?
The result–a new app and proposed political party called MiVote–aims to rethink how citizens participate in governance. Instead of voting only in elections, people using the app can share their views on every issue the government considers. The idea is that parliamentary representatives of the “MiVote party” would commit to support legislation only when it's in line with the will of the app's members–regardless of the representative's own opinion.
“This started off as a result of me getting slightly concerned as a father that my children were growing up in a world in which their voice was less and less relevant,” says Jacoby, who began working on MiVote three years ago. “It gets to a point where you sort of have to say, I can sit on the sidelines on Twitter and social media and bitch and moan about how terrible things are, or I can actually go and do something about it.”
Like Democracy Earth, a nonprofit that started in Argentina, MiVote uses the blockchain to make digital voting and identity fully secure. Democracy Earth also plans to use a similar model of representation, running candidates who promise to adhere to the results of online votes rather than a particular ideology.
But MiVote takes a somewhat different approach to gathering opinions. The app will give users a notification when a new issue is addressed in the Australian parliament. Then, voters get access to a digital “information packet,” compiled by independent researchers, that lets them dive into four different approaches.
“We don't talk about the bill or the legislation at all,” says Jacoby. “If you put it into a business context, the bill or the legislation is the contract. In no business would you write the contract before you know what the deal looks like. If we're looking for genuine democracy, the bill has to be determined by the people . . . Once we know where the people want to go, then we focus on making sure the bill gets us there.”
If the parliament is going to vote about immigration, for example, you might get details about a humanitarian approach, a border security approach, a financially pragmatic approach, and an approach that focuses on international relations. For each frame of reference, the app lets you dive into as much information as you need to decide. If you don't read anything, it won't let you cast a vote.
The University of Notre Dame is promoting the candidacy of its star junior running back for postseason awards, by today unveiling a #33Trucking website and Twitter account for Josh Adams.
Adams, who wears #33, has started generating Heisman chatter among major media outlets such as ESPN after his 19 carry, 191 yards, three touchdown performance against the USC Trojans. While the site bills itself as “A look at the 2017 Notre Dame football candidates for major end-of-season awards,” it's clearly focused on the Warrington, Pa. tailback. (It's also a work-in-progress.)
Adams has 967 rushing yards in 105 attempts and eight touchdowns. He's also caught nine balls for 84 yards so far this season.
The site's motto is: “Long drives. Reliably delivered.” Long, in this instance, refers to Adams' six runs of 60 or more yards, first nationally among Football Bowl Subdivision players.
Chris Simms, the former Texas Longhorns quarterback now working NBC Sports' pregame show for Notre Dame home games, expressed frustration today that Adams wasn't garnering the national attention Simms believes Adams deserves.
One reason Chris Simms says Josh Adams is being overlooked in Heisman talks: "He doesn't look as cool in his uniform as Saquon Barkley." pic.twitter.com/dWEfdQ96kN — Mike Vorel (@mikevorel) October 27, 2017
While Adams said earlier this week that he's tuning out Heisman chatter, that isn't slowing down the university's promotional machine. They planned to shoot a video Wednesday, “Inside the Mind,” that includes a voice-over from Adams and scenes that will take viewers on the journey from his freshman campaign all the way to last Saturday's explosive 84-yard scamper against the USC Trojans.
The video project is a collaboration among Cody Baker, former ESPNer-turned-university-employee Jaye Galloway, former Bleacher Report-turned-university-employee Adam Donaldson, and Jodain Massad, executive producer at Fighting Irish Media. If you watch anything from FIM, you know Adams' candidacy is in great hands.
The Internet is freaking out over this giant chicken

What is the cluck?
Early Sunday morning, when most of the Internet was taking a break from their obsession with the NCAA men's basketball tournament, they were likely having nightmares about a giant chicken. It started on Twitter, when a user with the handle @LifesBook_Ceo shared this clip:
Am I the only person wondering why this chicken is so damn big 🤔🤔🤔 pic.twitter.com/ZIWmEL2h2w — LifesBook_Ceo (@LifesBook_Ceo) March 19, 2017
No, this isn't footage from Jurassic Park, or someone in costume (as many users on Twitter understandably thought). It is an actual chicken. In fact, stick around until the end of the video and you'll spot a second, large chicken.
Naturally, this beast has ruffled Twitter's feathers.
Psa: please stop retweeting the video of the giant chicken, y'all are scaring me — Coconut Head (@c0conut_head) March 20, 2017
that video of the giant chicken scares the living hell out of me — ❄️salma (@salmaguzman97) March 20, 2017
I've been thinking about the video of the giant chicken all day and I know it's gonna give me nightmares — yova (@yovabundra) March 20, 2017
However, some are still not convinced this is real, because it's the Internet, of course:
I still refuse to believe that giant chicken video is real — Connor Guy (@cgu42) March 20, 2017
I have watched that video of the giant chicken like 20 times and it still puzzles me I need answers 🐔 they can't be real surely — Scarlett 🖤 (@emogrrlscarlett) March 20, 2017
The average weight of a chicken varies on the breed, but chickens can weigh as little as 1.5 pounds or as much as eight pounds. In the case of this monster fowl, several Twitter users have deduced it's a Brahma chicken. Females weigh as much as 14 pounds, while the males can weigh up to 18 pounds, according to The Livestock Conservancy, an organization focused on animal conservation.
Mashable reports the original video was likely posted to a Facebook group which appears devoted to chickens like the Brahma. The group page is also great nightmare fuel for those seeking more images of giant chickens.
Speaking of giant animals, we can't help but remind you of this classic: The Florida alligator that looks like a dinosaur. You know you want to watch it.

The road to success is proving to be longer and harder than they would like, but playing on the road isn't why the Ottawa Redblacks are 0-2 to kick off their first Canadian Football League season.
“Game week is game week,” offensive tackle Nate Menkin says on behalf of the Redblacks, who lost 36-28 to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on July 3 and 27-14 to the Edmonton Eskimos on Friday night.
“It doesn't matter if you're travelling or at home. Home-field advantage is always nice. You get the crowd, you get the noise, but, as far as travelling affecting the way we play, no, it's not the issue. It's not an excuse.”
A glass-half-full assessment of the Redblacks' play against the undefeated Blue Bombers and Eskimos, both 3-0, would note that they twice led at half-time, indicating that even as an expansion team they can compete at a CFL level as long as players perform their required assignments.
Glass-half-empty reviews would highlight insufficient offensive production and self-destructive penalties.
Henry Burris, No. 4 in CFL history with nearly 52,000 career passing yards, is just 30-for-55 (54.5 per cent) for 374 yards this season. He has been sacked seven times.
Chevon Walker has 154 rushing yards, but nearly half of that came on a single 65-yard touchdown sprint against the Eskimos. Another key point was Thomas DeMarco's failed third-down quarterback sneak at the Redblacks' 25-yard line.
In the words of Burris, it's a simple fix: The Redblacks must start making things happen.
“If we don't, then things will continue to be like that,” he says, “but we are going to continue to fight hard. We are not going to give up.
“Everybody goes through this at some part of the season, and for us it's right now, but we are going to find a way to get out of this, and right now the best place is home for everybody, so why not us next weekend.”
To improve their hopes of beating the Toronto Argonauts in this Friday's home opener at TD Place stadium, the Redblacks must stop beating themselves. Twelve more penalties against the Eskimos hiked their season total to 28.
Five of those 28 flags have been thrown for roughing the passer, including three against the Eskimos' Mike Reilly, although one of them was a moderately questionable call after defensive end Brandon Lang grabbed Reilly's jersey and tossed him to the turf.
That, though, was just one of two roughing fouls by Lang, who was also penalized for objectionable conduct and being offside.
As well, besides Edmonton's five sacks, Ottawa offensive linemen took three holding penalties.
“It's tough. We hate losing close games like that. We get on top of teams, and we just have to learn to finish those games, play four quarters of football,” Lang says. “We have to eliminate penalties, starting with myself, just get to be more disciplined out there.
“Please believe that next week will be a better week for us. We are going to come out there, be focused, and we are going to go hard.”
There were, of course, positive signs for the Redblacks at Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium, beginning with Walker's touchdown sprint down the left sideline.
Linebacker T.J. Hill had a rough night in pass coverage against much-taller Eskimos slotback Adarius Bowman, but Hill kept sticking his nose where it needed to be and finished with six tackles, one behind Jasper Simmons' team-leading sum.
Brett Maher had a fine game as a punter, averaging 47.3 yards, and Redblacks cover teams allowed none of the long kick returns that plagued them during preseason or in Game 1 against the Blue Bombers.
However, Maher also missed another must-make field-goal from 36 yards. The 24-year-old American is 3-for-5 for the season, not good enough for a first-year team that needs every point it can get.
Redblacks head coach Rick Campbell says he and his assistants will pore over video evidence from the two losses “and try to make sure that we are doing all that we can to help our players win games.
“We are disappointed right now, but it's going to be a long season, and we have to make sure that we try and correct things and we have to get our chins up and get ready for another big game next week.”
Redblacks players have practised at TD Place since late June, and they speak convincingly of the buzz from last Wednesday's fan-night event, but now they have to back it up with actions against the Argonauts (1-2).
“We have to put a show on for this home opener,” Lang says. “This is going to be history. We want to make it off on the right foot and do what we're supposed to do and handle business.”

Greece has been forced to suspend blood donations after a spike in cases of malaria, believed to have been brought over by the large influx of migrants who have entered the country.
So far, 12 municipalities have out of 325 have banned blood donations, with authorities fearing the infectious disease could spread to both locals and tourists during the height of the summer.
Athanassios Tsakris, professor of microbiology at the University of Athens, told reporters: “Drastic measures have to be taken to avert this strain from taking hold within the domestic population. The screening of migrants must also intensify.”
The Times reports that at least 65 cases of the disease have been recorded so far this year in Greece, compared to 85 cases in whole of last year. Malaria had been eradicated in Greece in the 1970s, but new cases have emerged in the past four years as large numbers of migrants arrive in the country.
So far, 61 of the cases reported this year were people who had brought malaria into the country, while four contracted the disease within Greece.
The disease is generally found in Africa and the Indian subcontinent.
A row broke out when the Greek health ministry claimed the outbreak was under control, with the Athens Medical Association hitting back, accusing the ministry of gross incompetence for cutting anti-mosquito spraying due to budget constraints.
MPs from the conservative opposition have now called for the health ministry's general secretary to resign for the failure to deal with the threat.
Last week, Breitbart reported how the number of migrants entering Greece has surged since the failed coup in Turkey, with around 100 new arrivals a day.
Although the number is far lower than last year, it suggests the migrant question is far from resolved.
Meanwhile, the number of migrants arriving in Italy is continuing to rise. In June, around 4,500 African migrants reached the country in a single day. Much travel across the Mediterranean in small dinghies from war-torn Libya, with around 10,000 dying while making the crossing since 2014.
Maulana Mahmood A Madani, Secretary General of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind said having a toilet has been made a mandatory condition for Muslim marriage in the three states and will be soon be applied in all other states in the country. (Representative Image)
No toilet, no nikah. Maulvis and muftis in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab have decided not to solemnise marriage in a house where there is no toilet. Maulana Mahmood A Madani, Secretary General of Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind said having a toilet has been made a mandatory condition for Muslim marriage in the three states and will be soon be applied in all other states in the country. “Maulvis and muftis in Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have decided that they will not solemnise the ‘nikah' or Muslim marriage in a house where there are no toilets,” he said. Madani, who is also a former Rajya Sabha MP, stated this during the inauguration of Assam Conference on Sanitation (ASCOSAN) 2017 conducted here in Khanapara last week. “I feel that all religious leaders from all the religion throughout the country should decide that they will not conduct any rituals in houses where there are no toilets,” he said.
Emphasising on cleanliness and sanitation, he asked people to use toilets and also to make not only Assam, but the country as a whole clean. “There are two types of cleaning – one is external and the other internal. Both are interconnected, we will only be able to achieve the internal cleaning if our body is clean,” he said. Speaking at the conference, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal also emphasised on the importance of sanitation and hygiene and asked the people of the state to make cleanliness as their life's goal. With the objective to showcase the commitment of the state and the people towards achieving the goal of Swachh Assam, ASCOSAN-2017, the biggest conference in the history of Assam, was organised in the city.
The sanitation conference, which has vowed to make Assam clean and open defecation-free (ODF) by this year, was attended by more than 6,000 people including those from the district level functionaries, Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI) members, urban local bodies as well as experts, corporate houses, and local people.
You may also like to watch:
Sonowal is aiming to make the state the cleanest by October 2, 2017, two years prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a ‘Clean India' by 2nd October 2019.
“Cleanliness should be our life's goal. Even the greatest men in history including the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi and various monks and sages teach us to follow sanitation and cleanliness,” said Sonowal.
“Humans take birth and die, but once a good work is started, it never dies and stays forever. Change will come only through hard work and I request everyone to work hard to make the state an example for the whole country,” he said.
Global Interfaith WASH Alliance (GIWA) also participated in the conference which brings together various faith leaders of major religions of India to put forward their faith-based message for WASH and take a pledge to work for it in their areas of influence.
He also made the public take a pledge at the conference to make the state clean. To encourage the spirit of sanitation he also awarded five cleanest villages.
Awards were also given to first ODF village, Gram Panchayat and block. Various ‘Sanitation Heroes' who have done commendable work in the sector and contributed in furthering the cause of Swachh Assam were also awarded.
“The awards are being given to encourage people to work hard for making the state clean,” said Sonowal.
Rangchapara, a Garo village in Goalpara district, was awarded as the cleanest village in the state.
“The concept of ‘Sanitation first' is a step towards ‘Make India', which is our new slogan along with Make in India which is started by the prime minister,” said Swami Chidanand Saraswati, Founder and chairman GIWA India.
“For achieving sanitation, we need political, personal and public will. Today we need to take everyone together without any boundaries and gaps. This, in true sense will be ‘sabka sath sabka vikas',” he said.
A new serious game by Duke University professor Zach Rosenthal is intended to help drug addicts control their cravings by placing them within the confines of a virtual crack house.
Cravings are a learned behavior, according to Rosenthal, so just as a person learns to crave a drug, he can also learn not to crave it. The game is meant to trigger cravings in addicts, who can then use learned triggers to make the feeling subside.
"What we're trying to do is take people into a virtual crack-related neighbourhood or crack-related setting and have them experience cravings, just like they would in the real world," Rosenthal said. Because there is no actual drug use in the virtual environment, the craving will eventually subside, which therapists can tie to external stimuli that will eventually help prevent the craving from arising in the first place.
One 52-year-old recovering addict said that the virtual reality treatment succeeded where years of other therapies did not. "The program has done wonders for me. Although I have fallen since I came out of the program, I am clean and have been clean for a good while."
But Rosenthal added that while the program is currently centered on crack abuse, the possibilities of the technique go far beyond that. "This isn't about cocaine, and this really isn't about substance abuse," he said. "This is about creating new learning and extending that learning to the real world."
The Delhi government has launched a crackdown against multiplexes for overcharging of packaged eatables, including water bottles and aerated drinks, in theatres. (Syda Productions - Fotolia)
The Delhi government has launched a crackdown against multiplexes for overcharging of packaged eatables, including water bottles and aerated drinks, in theatres.
Teams from the government's weights and measures department on Thursday conducted surprise inspections at (cinema halls/multiplexes) allegedly charging exorbitant prices in violation of Packaged Commodity Rules (PCR) on packaged eatables/drinks. The checks came at after directions from state food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain.
Sources said action was taken in 12 cases, but did not name the multiplexes.
The issue of being charged more than the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) at cinema halls had been raised in the Delhi Assembly on Tuesday.
A number of MLAs had pointed out that cinema halls and multiplexes were charging customers/cinema-goers in excess of MRP printed on the various packaged products such as biscuits, popcorn, aerated bottled water, chips and snacks.
For the offence, a retailer can be prosecuted under section 52, of the Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and the Packaged Commodities Rules, 2011, which has a penalty (compounding fees) of up to Rs 2,000. If the offender refuses to pay compounding fees, he can be prosecuted in a court, which attracts a penalty of up to R 25,000.
The minister had earlier directed resolution of the issue of dual MRP, which refers to pricing of a product differentially like water bottle price at retail shops and cinema halls.
Department officers informed that matter is being taken up with various establishments and stakeholders and that the matter is likely to be resolved soon.
The team on Thursday checked 14 cinema halls apart from a few restaurants also.
During these inspections, some multiplexes were booked for dual MRP on water bottles, soft drinks. Two restro bars were separately booked for overcharging on water bottles.

On November 26, 2013, Mr. Robert Levinson officially made history. He became the longest-held hostage in American history. This isn't something to celebrate. In fact, once you dig further into the details of the case, it's something that should create great concern among the American public. The fault of Robert's disappearance lies squarely on the shoulders of the CIA. Levinson's case is evidence that the CIA has been mismanaging its resources in recent years. Levinson's story proves what I blogged about in 2010 when I described how the CIA had started trying to privatize intelligence work, outsourcing the work to private companies like In-Q-Tel and others. I personally witnessed CIA attempts to gather intelligence via private sources back in 2006 and 2007, around the same time that CIA analyst Anne Jablonski had been communicating with Levinson, and going so far as to “hire” him to perform private investigations for the Agency under CIA contract. The catch is that despite the fact that the mainstream media today is referring to Levinson as a “CIA spy” – he is nothing of the sort. Levinson was a retired FBI analyst who – like many obsessed with the CIA – was intrigued by the world of covert spying and espionage. At least since 2006, the CIA has been taking advantage of such individuals and apparently in cases like Levinson, going so far as to provide funds to private sources to “unofficially” perform work for the agency. Unfortunately, in Levinson's case he got carried away, put himself in harm's way, and learned the hard way that he was not exactly the CIA spy that he thought he was. The Agency promptly disowned him, the press mislabeled him, and the U.S. government doesn't know what to do about him, because they're not exactly sure how he's classified. Is he a private citizen, or is he a spy like the media says?
My Experience Being “Outsourced” by the CIA Early in 2010, I blogged about some of my own communications with a CIA analyst named Ron Pandolfi, who works in the Science & Technology division of the CIA. For many years, Pandolfi had been actively seeking out individuals throughout the Ufology community and engaging specific individuals to perform some research for him. In 2007, I was personally asked to investigate the scientific claims of one Robert Baker and his claims as part of his “gravity wave” research. Fascinated by a potential new fraud to expose, I worked with fellow investigator Stephen Broadbent to dig further into Robert Baker and his research.
We discovered that Robert Baker had presented on the topic to foreign scientists from China, Russia and elsewhere, hosted by the Institute for Advanced Studies in Austin, Texas. Not to be confused with IAS at Princeton, Puthoff's IAS often hosts pseudo-scientists and scientific frauds. We obtained photographs and Powerpoints of the presentation, and were able to obtain many pages of writings by Robert Baker about the alleged science behind gravity wave research. I used the information to write up a full report of the story. However, prior to publishing, we shared what we had learned with Ron Pandolfi as a courtesy, since he had provided the initial lead. Oddly, he asked us to hold off on publishing if we could, because “a report” would be coming out and he didn't want to scare off the scientists being briefed by the JASON group. Only a few months later, in October of 2008, the report “High Frequency Gravitational Waves” was published by JASON, discrediting the science of High Frequency Gravity Waves. Then it struck me, my services as an investigator had been utilized “unofficially” by the CIA. Even worse – I never received any payment for my efforts! Alas, I had a great story line for an article. I felt that I was maintaining journalistic integrity, because aside from not getting paid, I eventually began digging up information about Pandolfi himself and his decades-long efforts in manipulating the UFO community – a potentially embarrassing situation for the Agency. But, that is a story for another day.
Robert Levinson's Story What does this have to do with Robert Levinson? A lot. It serves as further evidence that in 2006, the CIA – or at least certain groups within the Agency – was actively exploring using private citizens or organizations to outsource the analysis of intelligence. Robert Levinson played right into those cards. He had worked at the FBI for nearly his entire career as a Russian organized crime expert, but in 1998, the NY Times reports, he decided to quit “because he needed money”. He proceeded to get into private investigation work, but the allure of working for the government never left him, and when his colleague from the CIA – analyst Anne Jablonski – told him that the Agency might have an opportunity for him in the form of a consulting contract, he jumped. Levinson had never worked as a covert agent – his career at the FBI was as an Agent in Russian organized crime – studying intel, developing informants and tracking down criminals. The so-called “contract” that Jablonski offered Levinson involved similar work – obtaining and studying intelligence and developing “reports” for the group. His experience with the FBI served him well – his reports were in fact more informative than many of the covert reports coming from the clandestine branch of the Agency. In 2006, Jablonski wrote to Levinson and told him: “You'd have SO enjoyed being a fly on the wall today in our meeting about you. Everyone was so happy about the info but just freaking out about how to NOT piss off our ops colleagues for doing a better job than they do.”
The situation reveals a lot about the Agency's tactics starting in 2006. Apparently, there were funds set aside for groups within the CIA to hire outside contractors for various jobs. It seems as though those funds were not carefully monitored. Once Levinson turned up missing and an internal investigation took place, it was revealed (by CIA officials to Ms. Levinson and her lawyer) that CIA officials were clueless about what kind of activities that Robert Levinson was up to in the CIA's name. “According to Mr. McGee, the C.I.A. officials said that while an inquiry had not found a ‘smoking gun' proving that the agency knew in advance about Mr. Levinson's trip, it did conclude that Ms. Jablonski and her boss, Mr. Sampson, had misled officials about his work.” What this reveals are that there were likely a number of analyst groups (not part of the clandestine branch) who took it upon themselves to start conducting operations to obtain information about foreign groups and individuals utilizing private contractors. Levinson's downfall was believing that his activities were fully known and approved by CIA leadership, and trusting Jablonski to act in his best interests.
Robert Levinson's Disappearance So what led to Levinson's disappearance? Even after Jablonski's funding had run out and she advised Levinson that he no longer had to send additional reports, Levinson continued his research and sending reports to the CIA. It was clear that much more drove him to work for the CIA than just money. His first mistake was trying to go after a big fish for the agency – attempting to obtain an informant inside of Iran. The last place any American with even a remote connection to the CIA should go is Iran. Yet, there he went in hopes of hooking up with a man named Dawud Salahuddin at the Maryam Hotel on the island of Kish, near Dubai. Salahuddin is also the last man that an American would want to meet while making the mistake of visiting Iran. Salahuddin had actually lived in the United States before dressing up as a mailman and murdering the former press attache for the Iranian Embassy, in the man's Bethseda, MD home. He then escaped the U.S. and hid in exile in Iran ever since. This murderer was the man who Levinson was naively meeting – hoping to gain a “big fish” for the CIA. What happened instead is that Levinson disappeared. Salahuddin's story was that Iran officials had taken him into custody. Unfortunately, Salahuddin is not at all credible, and the Iran government denies it had anything to do with the disappearance. Whoever has been holding the man hostage since March 8, 2007, finally sent a “proof of life” video of Mr. Levinson to his family in 2010. A few months later in 2011, they sent the family a picture of Levinson dressed in an orange jumpsuit, reminiscent of a Guantanamo Bay inmate. The images showed him sporting a very long, white beard, and holding a variety of signs, such as “This is the result of 30 years serving for the USA” and “Why you can not help me”. There are no reports of any demand from the group, but the FBI is at least now offering a $1 million reward for information leading to the recovery of Mr. Levinson. Unfortunately, the FBI doesn't have a very good track record when it comes to honoring those rewards. Nevertheless, maybe the media campaign improperly labeling Levinson as a CIA “spy” will at least create a political environment ripe for his negotiated release by U.S. Officials. Or, maybe the captors will get tired of using Levinson as an example to the world to try to shame America, and simply let him go free? Regardless, the story should serve as a wake-up call to all of you investigators and other private contractors who believe that you are “officially” working for the CIA on a sanctioned project. Before you accept any kind of dangerous “mission” and head out into some part of the world where no sane American has any business going – you may just want to get some confirmation from a higher level in the Agency that your so-called “mission” is actually legit. Otherwise – you could end up in the same no-man's land that Levinson ended up. Not quite a private citizen, and not quite a spy either – just a naive FBI retiree who let his dreams of espionage and spying take over his better judgement.

Egypt will not accept any foreign intervention in Syria, which saw its Arab League membership suspended on Saturday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr said today.
According to the United Nations, more than 3,500 people have been killed by the regime of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad since a popular uprising erupted early this year amid an unprecedented wave of protests throughout the Arab world.
Syria hammered out a deal with the Arab League on 2 November aimed at ending the bloodshed, but later backtracked on the agreement. The turnaround prompted the league to suspend Syria's membership in the pan-Arab organisation on Saturday in a surprise move.
Egypt supported the decision to suspend Syria's membership but has stressed that it would oppose any foreign intervention in the troubled country.
“The unity of Syria is an absolute priority; we must keep it intact under any circumstances,” Amr said in a statement. “Our position remains unchanged: we want an immediate halt to violence and protection for civilians.”
“Dialogue between all parties is necessary to get out of this crisis, and that was included in the Arab League initiative that was rejected by Syria,” he added.
The Arab League has also called on member states to withdraw their respective ambassadors from Damascus, and has floated the possibility of imposing economic and political sanctions on the country.

In this sick, twisted society that the Europeans have bought and paid for, anyone who murders Jews is considered a role model. Anyone who supports peace with Israel is denounced as a "traitor."
When the Western-backed Palestinian Authority openly endorses terrorists and names streets, squares and schools after them, Palestinian leaders are sending a message to their people that murdering Jews is a noble and dignified act. This show of solidarity with a baby-killer is the direct result of ongoing incitement against Israel and Jews in mosques, the press and social media in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Samir Kuntar murdered four Israelis. One of his victims was a four-year-old girl, Einat Haran. Kuntar smashed her skull. Kuntar was killed this week in Syria while helping President Bashar Assad commit war crimes against his own citizens.
Samir Kuntar was a terrorist who committed one of the most brutal terrorist attacks one can imagine. On April 22, 1979, Kuntar, who was then 16 years old, murdered four Israelis in the Israeli city of Nahariya. One of his victims was a four-year-old girl, Einat Haran. Kuntar smashed her skull after murdering her 31-year-old father, Danny.
This week, Kuntar was killed in an explosion that destroyed his apartment south of the Syrian capital, Damascus. He had been in Syria helping President Bashar Assad commit war crimes against his own Syrian citizens. Kuntar had been sent to Syria also as part of the Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah terror group, to plan major terror attacks against Israel from Syria.
Lebanese terrorist Samir Kuntar (left) was killed this week in Syria. Kuntar murdered four Israelis in 1979, including Einat, Danny and Yael Haran (right). Kuntar's murderous résumé turned him into a hero in the eyes of many prominent Palestinians.
Kuntar was not a Palestinian. He was Lebanese Druze. This irregularity still has not stopped Palestinians from adoring him for murdering Jews. Palestinians will worship anyone who carries out a terror attack against Israel or Jews -- such as the Japanese terrorist, Kozo Okamoto, who led the 1972 massacre at Israel's Lod Airport, in which 24 people were murdered and more than 70 wounded.
In the eyes of many Palestinians, Kuntar's murderous résumé, like Okamoto's, has turned him into a "martyr" and a "hero." The arch-terrorist is now being mourned in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a "national hero and fighter" who sacrificed his life for the sake of the Palestinians. This is who many Palestinians consider their role model: the only requirement is that they try to destroy Israel and murder Jews. It is as if all the Muslims in France idolized the men who committed the November 13 massacres at Paris's football stadium and the Bataclan Theater, and committed themselves to being just like them.
The love affair between Kuntar and the Palestinians began many years ago, while the terrorist was serving time in Israeli prison. Palestinian prisoners such as Fatah's Marwan Barghouti and Ahmed Sa'dat, Secretary-General of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), proudly posted photos of themselves posing with Kuntar. Barghouti is now serving five life sentences for his role in deadly terror attacks against Jews between 2000 and 2006. Sa'dat is in prison for his role in gunning down Israel's Minister of Tourism, Rehavam Ze'evi, in a hotel in 2001.
Upon learning of Kuntar's death, Barghouti, who is a senior official with the "moderate" and Western-backed Fatah faction, published the following eulogy: "One thousand greetings to your soul. We shall meet."
Although the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority has so far refrained from commenting on the assassination of the Lebanese Druze terrorist, Fatah websites have been mourning and praising Kuntar as a "hero" and "martyr."
Sultan Abu Al-Einein, a senior Fatah official who is close to President Mahmoud Abbas, and apparently does not favor terrorists being killed, denounced the assassination as a "despicable Israeli crime." Abu Al-Einein went on to praise Kuntar as a "martyr" who had contributed to the Palestinian cause from the age of 16. Not surprisingly, the Fatah official failed to mention that Kuntar had brutally murdered four Israelis, including a little girl. Evidently, Abu Al-Einein believes that murdering Jews is not a "despicable crime," but killing an arch-terrorist is a "despicable crime" -- one that requires the entire international community to punish those responsible!
In the Gaza Strip, only hours after the terrorist was killed in Syria, a Palestinian father, Maher Huthut, announced that he has named his newborn baby after Samir Kuntar. The announcement was presumably meant to express Palestinian "gratitude" for Kuntar's "sacrifices" on behalf of the Palestinians. In yet another sign of affection for Kuntar, various Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip set up a large tent to receive condolences over his death. Hundreds of Palestinians visited the tent to express their deep condolences over his death, and many pledged to follow in Kuntar's footsteps.
Palestinian factions are now planning a similar move in Ramallah, only a few hundred meters away from the office and residence of President Mahmoud Abbas.
This outpouring of sympathy and affection from the Palestinians for Kuntar should not surprise anyone. Palestinians have long been glorifying terrorists and jihadis who attack and kill any Jew, whether soldier or civilian. When Palestinian leaders -- the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, not even Hamas -- openly endorse terrorists and name streets, squares and schools after them, they are sending a message to their people that murdering Jews is a noble and dignified undertaking, and that it is virtuous to do more of it!
It is frankly disgusting, even as a Palestinian, to see so many of my countrymen mourning and heaping praise on a man who murders babies. This show of solidarity with a baby-killer and arch-terrorist is the direct result of the ongoing incitement against Israel and Jews that takes place each day in mosques, the press and social media in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It is precisely this non-stop incitement and indoctrination that is driving young Palestinians to take knives, run out, and stab the first Jew they meet.
Despite what the European politicians funding them wish to think, Palestinian leaders are not educating their people for tolerance, non-violence and peace. Instead, with the money they are given by these dreamy northerners who seem to imagine the world is one big loving day-care center, they continue to poison the hearts and minds of their people through incendiary lies and the most bigoted rhetoric.
The Europeans, who are largely bankrolling this venom, should be made to know that this is what their generosity is used for. And that this is precisely why no peace process with Israel will ever work. Thanks mainly to the largesse of European funding that keeps most Palestinians from thinking of other ways to earn a living, Palestinian terrorism is now a big business! The gullible Europeans have enabled an entire generation to be raised on the glorification of terrorists such as Kuntar. I do hope this makes the Europeans feel very good about themselves.
In this sick, twisted society that the Europeans have bought and paid for, anyone who murders Jews is considered a role model. But anyone who supports peace with Israel is instantly denounced as a "traitor." It is high time for the Europeans and others in the West to wake up.
As Canada prepares to welcome 25,000 new refugees from Syria before the end of the year, the business community in Nova Scotia is eagerly awaiting their arrival.
Some believe an influx of new and ambitious refugees could help stimulate the economy.
In February 2014, Nova Scotia's Ivany Report recommended that the province receive 7,000 new immigrants annually.
With the co-operation of the federal government, Nova Scotia would receive its proportional share — 2.7 per cent — of all new international immigrants to Canada, the report recommends.
The current five-year average is 2,400 immigrants per year.
Rob Batherson, chair of the board of directors of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, says that 7,000 immigrants would help maintain or even increase the overall population.

"We've had stagnant population now for quite some time and we have an aging population as well. So gradually the working age population is shrinking ... We need new, younger people to come into the economy to contribute, to set up businesses, employ other Nova Scotians and expand our tax base rather than manage with a shrinking tax base."
Batherson said Syrians, like other immigrant groups that have come to the province in the past, are likely to be entrepreneurs and have a strong willingness to work.
"For example, many of today's most successful business leaders were refugees from Lebanon, from the civil war in the '60s and '70s," said Batherson. "[They] come into Nova Scotia, create wealth, create jobs, increase tax revenue. So what I'm excited about with the potential with more Syrian refugees coming in is who in that class of refugees will be the next Nova Scotia success story for the next 30 years?"
Cape Breton ready for refugees
In Cape Breton, members of the Lifeline Syria Cape Breton committee met with Sydney-Victoria MP Mark Eyking and a representative from Glace Bay MP Rodger Cuzner's office on Thursday afternoon.
They met to push forward the group's message that it is prepared to welcome refugees.
Amanda McDougall, manager of Immigration Partnerships at Cape Breton University and a member of the group, participated in the discussion. She echoed Batherson's statements.

"We've had [an] influx of huge numbers of immigrants and refugees throughout our history. It's proven that when refugees come here, they come with a more entrepreneurial spirit. There's a different type of work ethic. Families come, businesses grow, opportunities grow."
McDougall hopes the government will consider settling refugees in smaller urban centres like Sydney, which stand to gain a lot from an influx of new immigrants. On the flip side, the community can do a lot for its new residents.
"You would really get more bang for your buck in terms of supports for refugees. When you're putting a small amount of money into refugee services here, it's really creating such a wonderful outpouring to the entire community and refugees are going to receive a lot more one-on-one support," McDougall said.
She admits areas outside metro Halifax lack certain immigration settlement services that refugees would be seeking.
McDougall said she has asked that the government assist in providing those services in the immediate future and that eventually they be more evenly spread out in the province.
Nova Scotia's Immigration Minister Lena Diab is expected to make an announcement on the province's role in the refugee crisis on Friday following a meeting with her federal counterpart, John McCallum.
Just a quick follow-up to my segwit code review:
Suhas Daftuar reproduced the mempool DoS vulnerability I found, and has a partial fix addressing the case where prior to segwit activation, an attacker adds fake witness data to transactions. Unfortunately it's far from a complete fix: once segwit is deployed attackers can still malleate segwit transactions on the P2P level (kind of like how I can give you a json-encoded tx, rather than the binary one you were expecting, tricking you into thinking that txid is garbage; this is not malleating the txid at the consensus layer). So we've got more work to do on the mempool. Johnson Lau raised a few issues with my review; in particular correcting a flaw in my reasoning about the P2WPKH case. Mark Friedenbach raised an issue with the midstate compatibility of the segwit commitment, which we all discussed, and I think resolved for now.
Other recent dev work:
I attended the W3C Blockchain Workshop held at MIT last week. Gave a short talk on my Dex work, though mostly the conference was about workshopping rather than talks; spent a ton of time discussing this stuff with others, and started writing a preliminary in-depth specification for Dex. I also spent a bunch of time discussing Bitcoin scaling issues with some of the MIT students. Hard fork discussion with other devs; Ethereum's DAO bailout proposal is quite interesting there… I noticed that they're doing an unofficial coin vote, which currently has 10% voting no… but just 2.8% of the market cap participating. Also, the implementation of the voting isn't very good: major censorship concerns (though Ethereum has very poor privacy in general). Watched Americans celebrate the birth of their country by blowing up a small part of it.
UTXO Set Size vs. Value Distribution
Pieter Wuille posted an interesting chart of how the UTXO set size (serialized bytes) is distributed across the value of those unspent outputs. As you can see over half the storage cost is from outputs worth less than $0.65 USD, with around a third of the size taken up by outputs under 6 cents. Still, that's not that bad: the supermajority of the UTXO size is outputs that can be spent profitably, with only a relatively small minority unspendable “spam”.
In an effort to offer healthier menu items, McDonald's has unveiled a new salad with a “nutrient-rich lettuce blend with baby kale,” shaved parmesan, and chicken (grilled or fried). Like many fast-food salads, it may seem like a healthy option at first, but it's not. The salad, when paired with the restaurant's Asiago Caesar Dressing, packs more fat, calories, and salt than a double Big Mac—that's a sandwich with four beef patties.
While the nutrition check on a McDonald's item may not come as a shock, the unhealthy salad option falls into a bigger trend of restaurant meals—fast food or not, eating out is hard on your waistline and health.
In one recent study, researchers found that 92 percent of large-chain, local-chain, and mom-and-pop restaurants served meals that exceeded the calorie intake for a healthy meal. The study included 364 meals from restaurants in three cities: Boston, San Francisco, and Little Rock, Arkansas. The meals covered American, Chinese, Greek, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Thai, and Vietnamese-style cuisine.
In 123 of the restaurants sampled, at least one menu entrée exceeded the recommended amount of calories for an entire day—and that didn't include drinks, appetizers, or desserts. Meals from American, Chinese and Italian-style restaurants tipped the scales with the most calories, an average of 1,495 calories per meal.
Another recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a similar trend in restaurants in and around California Polytechnic State University. The study looked at meals from 20 on-campus food joints and 37 off-campus. Only 12 percent of the 314 meals tested were considered healthy by the researchers. They defined a healthy entrée as having no more than 800 calories, 30 percent or less of calories from fat, and no more than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat. Only 36 percent of entrée salads met the mark for a healthy meal.
Perhaps most striking, fast-food restaurants scored better at having healthy food options than sit-down restaurants.

According to the evidence presented in the latest research that has been posted on the Internet in recent years, Adolph Hitler's father, Alois Hitler was the illegitimate son of Baron Salomon Meyer Rothschild, head of the Vienna branch of the famous bank.
Discovering Hitler's Secret Origins:
The Rothschild's 19th Century Trans-Continental Courier System
& The Significance of Hitler's Birthplace
By Clifford Shack
Did Adolph Hitler Have Two Fathers?It is known that Viennese police regularly hushed-up Rothschild's abuses with regard to the women in his employ.Before the Nazis assassinated him, Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss managed to uncover the records that proved that Hitler's grandmother, Anna Maria Schicklgruber, was a servant in Rothschild's Vienna mansion. Her employment was terminated when she became pregnant, presumably through Baron Rothschild.She returned to her home to Spital, Austria where she gave birth to her son, Alois Schicklgruber. Alois later changed his name to Hitler presumably to hide his origins.Alois would marry Klara Polzl and go on to father Adolph Hitler or so the story goes.One researcher disagrees with this version of Hitler's origin. One researcher is witness to evidence which sheds new light on the identity of Hitler's biological father.Author, Rabbi and Dayan (Judge), Marvin S. Antelman, had received testimony during a court case in which he presided that Hitler's biological father was not Alois Hitler.Antelman, author of "To Eliminate the Opiate, Volumes I & II", had learned through testimony, that Alois Hitler was not Adolph Hitler's father - but stepfather.According to "To Eliminate the Opiate, Volume II", Hitler's parents, were both connected to the Frankist/Sabbatian movement based upon the teachings of Jacob Frank and Shabbatai Tzvi, both considered false Messiahs by mainstream Judaism.Hitler's parents, according to Antelman, had participated in at least one of the movement's ceremonies. A ceremony that involved sex among its members. The ceremony occurred on a holiday known as Tisha B'Av or the ninth day of the month of Av.In Judaism, "Tisha B'Av" is the darkest day on the Jewish calendar, commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples. The solemn day is observed by Jews as a day of fasting and prayer. However Frankists celebrated the day with joy and sex. The ninth of Av was the birthday of the movements founder Shabbetai Tzvi.(According to the Talmud, the Messiah would be born on Tisha B'Av.)Shabbetai Tzvi was thought to be the Messiah by the majority of the Jewish world in the seventeenth century. His popularity lasted about 18 years. The Frankist Sect, which was rooted in the messianic mission of Shabbetai Zvi (despite his conversion to Islam), celebrates the day of his birth with sex rituals involving incest and adultery.According to Rabbi Antelman, Adolph Hitler was conceived, in Vienna, during a Frankist celebration of the Ninth of Av, which took place on July 20th, 1888. Adolph Hitler was born 9 months later on April 20th, 1889.According to Antelman, Adolph Hitler's biological father participated in that ceremony of July 20th. Antelman identifies him as a wealthy "Hungarian" Jew who was born in 1861 and died on September 21, 1928. According to Rabbi Antelman the man died in New York City and his first name was Abraham.Upon hearing the testimony, given under oath, Rabbi Antelman made a commitment not to reveal the family name of Hitler's biological father so as to prevent his descendants any embarrassment especially since one of Abraham X's descendents had become quite prominent within the American Orthodox Jewish community.It was Hitler's step-father's biological father's relatives that secured Hitler the pivotal role he would play on the world stage. Revealing Abraham X's identity would accomplish nothing to our understanding of who Hitler was and how did he manage to wreak the havoc that he did. His Rothschild connection explains everything to one wise in the methods and goals of the Shabbatean/Frankist core of the Masonic Illuminati.Hitler's Birthplace
When Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, Nathan Rothschild, the head of the House of Rothschild, obtained the first news of Napoleon's defeat even before the British government itself. It is said, the banker informed the British government of the victory then proceeded to the London Stock Exchange where he made a huge sum of money. The Rothschilds owed their success, in large part, to their safe and fast couriers.
Their courier network linked the five Rothschild banks of London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna and Naples. The Rothschilds extended their courier service to some of their clients as well. (In June 1841, Queen Victoria assured Leopold Rothschild that she "always" sent all her letters to Germany "wh. are of any real consequence...thro' Rothschild wh. is perfectly safe and very quick." )
"All this meant that the Rothschilds were in a position to provide a unique news service to the European elite. Major political events as well as confidential information could be relayed from one city to another well ahead of official channels. Nathan's early news of the outcome of Waterloo was only the first of many such coups..."(pg.235 The House of Rothschild:Money's Prophets 1798-1848, Niall Ferguson)
In our efforts to penetrate the mystery of Hitler's secret origins, understanding the Rothschild's early courier system will prove quite useful.
What determined the nature of courier route utilized for the day-to-day communications of Europe's greatest banking empire.
Intelligence gathering was one major consideration in determining the courier route. Important business hubs like Munich would not be excluded from the Frankfurt-Vienna route. The Rothschilds had a great interest in the affairs of Munich. Incorporating the city into the courier route from Frankfurt to Vienna was an obvious necessity. Heading east towards Vienna the couriers would pass through the city of Linz, which lied along the Danube corridor midway between Vienna and the German-Austrian border.
The German-Austrian border brings us to another very important point. Another vital aspect of the courier system was safety and nowhere would safety be more threatened than at a border crossing. Secure border crossings were crucial to safe and secure courier transport. The last thing the Rothschilds needed was a nosy custom official snooping around their courier pouches. Rothschild business was simply that- Rothschild business. Europe itself would often depend on those deployed couriers.
How the Rothschilds managed to keep border officials in line is an interesting topic of discussion. Of course there was bribery, however there was an even better way to insure the loyalty of a border official.
Adolph Hitler was born in 1889 on the German-Austrian border in the Austrian border town of Brannau-on-the-Inn. Brannau is situated on the Inn River midway between Munich and Linz. A key border crossing between Germany and Austria, Brannau is the gateway for travel between Munich and Vienna. Travel from Frankfurt to Vienna through Munich couriers would enter Austria at the Brannau crossing.
Why was Adolph Hitler born in Brannau? At the time of his birth, his father, Alois, was the chief customs official at the Brannau border crossing. This fact is quite curious as there is strong evidence that Hitler's father was the illegitimate son of Baron Salomon Mayer Rothschild, head of the Rothschild family's Vienna branch.
The Rothschilds made good use of the hushed members of their family. August Belmont, the top American Rothschild agent (before J.P.Morgan) is long suspected of being an illegitimate Rothschild son. While August had a head for finance, others like Alois Hitler (Schicklgruber) were given livelihoods compatible with their aptitudes within the family business, in Alois' case he appears to have been trained in the military as a runner. His training would compliment his work as a Rothschild courier. Later on he was promoted to the post of chief customs official in Brannau. (It is interesting that Adolph Hitler was a runner during World War I. Was he following in his father's footsteps? If not for his discovered oration abilities, making him a prime political candidate for future Rothschildian plots, he probably would have found himself working within the family courier or intelligence network as his father more than likely did…
Did the Rothschilds have other illegitimate sons installed as political leaders of historical consequence? Were there there other historical leaders that were trained within the Rothschild courier system?
Was Josef Stalin's father just a well-connected cobbler or was Stalin's father a Rothschild?
You decide...

Jeff Williams is a critically-acclaimed composer who works primarily for the production company Rooster Teeth , and is known for scoring music for many of their various works including the webseries, and, along with the company's upcoming feature comedy. His daughter, Casey Lee Williams, is often involved with his works, and is the lead localist for the RWBY soundtrack I recently got the chance to ask Jeff a number of questions, and I am extremely grateful that he was willing to set aside a little bit of time to respond to them, even if the process was considerably rushed. I do feel rather bad for taking him away from his crazy busy projects. Enjoy the interview!It appears some people didn't realize that the final question was entirely a joke, which I made abundantly clear to Jeff beforehand. I jokingly pitched it to a friend while I was writing the interview questions, and they somehow convinced me to keep it in.---------Jeff Williams: A nightmare. I'm actually working onnow. I work almost every day for 12-16 hours.JW: I don't currently work on X+V; that's just Steve [Goldshein] and Alex [Abraham] doing that right now. They love working on that show.I like writing songs, really. I just let my imagination run and I think about the shows and the characters a lot. I could never make an album that was one style of music from start to end... It's just my nature to jump around in different styles.JW: They are both awesome composers and great people, and have very different sounds and skills.

Rooster Teeth's audio mixing is... well, let's just say... it doesn't tend to flatter the music.I interact with the characters in a different way than the viewer does. I need to dream about them and imagine their lives and their thoughts and their feelings and experiences. I need to let my imagination run around and pretend the characters are telling me their deepest secrets. What the viewer sees in the show is just a tiny slice of that character's life. Writing anything requires a lot of pretending.I watch very little TV, I don't watch a ton of movies. I don't have that kind of free time, and I'm just not interested in 99% of what is produced.JW: I would guess so, but I honestly don't know right now.JW: Hiking, fashion, girls, cars that I would buy if I had enough time to drive them.JW: Embarrassment when she denies you.JW: I'm so glad that it is.

President Trump's moral weakness became (even more) glaringly evident this week in his response to the so-called ‘Alt Right' rally in Charlottesville featuring the Klu Klux Klan, Neo-Nazis and White Nationalists that resulted in the death of one woman named Heather Heyer and injured many others. Trump's ‘both sides' equivocation gave encouragement to racists groups who applauded his response, and caused deep pain in most Americans.
Yet President Trump's failure has provoked serious responses from some unexpected quarters.
The Manufacturing Council and The Strategy Policy Forum were both seeing mass defections by CEOs seeking to distance themselves from the President before Trump decided to disband the councils instead of facing more humiliation. The President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities followed suit writing a harsh letter of resignation with paragraphs formatted in such a way as to spell R E S I S T.
There is, however, one advisory group that remains largely intact and resistant to any calls to moral accountability: the President's Evangelical Advisory Board, whose members are listed below. As of the writing of this piece, only one of this board has separated himself from the hurtful and racist apologetics coming from the White House.
A. R. Bernard, who is Founder, Senior Pastor and CEO of Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, NY issued a statement on social media in which he cited a “deepening conflict in values between myself and the Administration.”

Aside from this one example of courage from an African American member, the Evangelical Advisory Board has been either silent or overtly supportive of the President's response to the open displays of racism and anti-Semitism on display in Charlottesville. Indeed, Jerry Falwell Jr. took this opportunity to praise the president in a tweet for his “bold truthful stmt about #charlottesville tragedy.”
It seems incredible to those of us who dare to think that people who profess to follow a dark skinned Palestinian Jew would be hesitant to call out President Trump for his clearly disastrous and harmful rhetoric. Yet, thus far they are sticking with him.
One person who isn't surprised is Dr. Robert Jones, CEO of the polling and research firm PRRI and whose book The End of White Christian America is crucial reading for understanding the reaction of White Evangelicals to this President. Jones told Voices:
“With regard to Trump's evangelical advisory committee, the views he espoused this week are consistent with views he expressed in the campaign. So the evangelicals on his advisory committee knew this was the president they were agreeing to serve. And like most things in the Trump orbit, the committee is mostly setup to be a Trump fan club rather than a committee that broadly represents the major entities in the evangelical world. Also note: Given white evangelicals' own checkered past supporting segregation and remaining silent about white supremacy groups (something I covered in my book), there may in fact be widespread agreement with the remarks. For example, we conducted some recent analysis of perceptions of the Confederate flag, and found that 72% of white evangelicals say that they see the Confederate flag more as a symbol of southern pride than as a symbol of racism.
So, while many Americans would like for the Evangelical Advisory Board to either help Trump see the error of his ways or leave the Board, it seems unlikely that at least the white members have any inclination or willpower to do so.
As we approach the ten month mark of the 2016 election, it is worth remembering that the majority of White Christian Americans voted for Trump with more than 8 in 10 white Evangelical Protestants, and a strong majority of white Roman Catholics and Mainline Protestants.
In a letter called Dear White Christians written on the eve of the inauguration, a group of White Christians called out their fellow White Christians for voting for Donald Trump writing:
Those votes for Trump have confirmed for many of our black, brown, and Asian Christian neighbors that white Christians are willing to support someone who perpetuates white supremacy; who believes that men have the right to insult and abuse women; who routinely bullies and insults his critics; who glorifies wealth and success. All in favor of our own personal interests. Which means that now, support for Donald Trump has made Christianity seem insincere and self-centered rather than the just and generous way of Jesus Christ attested to in Scripture.
Today we see another crisis moment like the election when the very legitimacy of American Christian leaders, and especially Evangelical leaders, is in question. While America hopes that they will provide a moral compass for this out of control, immoral presidency, we fear that they will fail, and in doing so fail the very Lord and faith they profess.

Garath McCleary's goal was his first in the league since the final day of last season
Bristol City dropped to second-from-bottom in the Championship as they lost 2-0 at home to Reading.
Reading controversially took the lead when Nick Blackman, who City felt was offside, was put through on goal by Garath McCleary and shot home.
McCleary made it 2-0 shortly afterwards as his powerful low drove from almost 30 yards beat Frank Fielding.
City rarely troubled the Royals' defence and they still look for a first home win since promotion last season.
Reading moved into the play-off places thanks to the victory, which was their third in four games.
The Royals' opening goal caused consternation on the Bristol City bench as Blackman's curled left-footed effort took a deflection off Derrick Williams and nestled into the bottom corner.
Blackman was offside in the build-up to the goal, but was deemed not to be interfering with play as a pass from deep found McCleary on the right, with Blackman getting back onside as he received the ball from McCleary.
There were no such doubts for Reading's second soon after as McCleary was given far too much space by the City defence as he blasted home from distance.
City's Aaron Wilbraham had an appeal for a penalty turned down before on-loan Chelsea defender Michael Hector produced a goal-saving challenge to deny City's Jonathan Kodjia.
The home side had another penalty claim turned down 10 minutes from full-time after Kodija went down under a challenge from Paul McShane, while the Frenchman hit the post from close range after Kieran Agard's cross fizzed across the face of goal in the final minute.
Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill: "We felt hard done by with the first goal and thought there was an offside leading up to it. Until then we had begun brightly.
"It hurt us badly and we just need one or two decisions to go our way at the moment.
"We had a bit of bad luck hitting the post, but I'm not sure we did enough on the afternoon to deserve anything.
"There wasn't the normal zip to our passing. I put that down to fatigue, rather than lack of confidence and we will keep encouraging the players to be positive because there is a long way to go in the season."
Reading manager Steve Clarke: "To control any Championship game as we did today take some doing and the team deserve enormous credit.
"We got ourselves in front early on and, while we could have had more goals, you won't find me complaining.
"I know Steve Cotterill was unhappy with our opening goal, but I was too far away to see if it was offside and people I have spoken to say it wasn't."
Nick Blackman gave Reading an early lead...
... to the consternation of City manager Steve Cotterill
Forget the bug-eyed green aliens with advanced technology. Life on other planets may exist in forms too tiny to see, if mysterious tiny organisms like those found under our oceans live elsewhere.
Scientists have discovered bacteria living in 86 million-year-old red clay under the ocean floor, cut off from sunlight and all other life, that may be subsisting on the minimum bit of energy required to sustain life. They use up oxygen extremely slowly, and are still recycling material that fell from the ocean's surface millions of years ago.
"If you wanted to look for life for another planet, I think this is a really good bet," said Hans Røy, biologist at Aarhus University in Aarhus, Denmark. Røy is the lead author of a new study about the bacteria that appears in the journal Science.
Røy and colleagues found the microscopic organisms about 30 meters (100 feet) below the ocean floor in the northern Pacific Ocean. Most of the genes from the bacteria don't look like anything we know on the surface.
"The paper is really fascinating, because the first time you really have a sense of the respiration rates for these buried microbial communities, you can speculate more about how long can these cut-off communities actually last, and how fast can they grow, how old can they get," says Antje Boetius of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology, who was not involved in Røy's study.
The bacteria have been sitting in 86 million-year-old sediment - mostly dead algae, small crustaceans, and dust - making the environment essentially an 86 million-year-old experiment. And you can't watch them grow - that'd be like staring at a tree waiting for it to get taller, Røy said.
"We don't know if they're just the remnants of those who were once at the surface and are just not dying," Røy said. "It seems like they are adapted to the environment where they live."
But it's hard to believe that the bacteria themselves are 86 million years old. Boetius estimates, given the respiration rate that Røy found, this particular group is up to 500 years old. But that's not proven, and it's still mysterious how they are getting and using such minimal energy.
There are other single-celled organisms found beneath the seafloor that appear to live for about 1,000 years before dividing. By contrast, E. coli bacteria - the pathogen found in spoiled food - reproduce about every 20 minutes.
To give you a sense of what sediment buildup means, think of the dust in your apartment or bedroom. If you never vacuumed, the dust layer would grow. If you assume a certain dust settling rate, you could calculate the time it would take to fill the entire space with dust.
"The seafloor is nothing but an accumulation of dust from the overlying seawater," says Boetius.
About 90% of the single-celled organisms on Earth live below the seafloor.
"They have no clue that we are around," Røy said of the bacteria his group studied. "They have no contacts with the surface anymore, and they just apparently keep on living for a very long time on the inside of our planet."
Similar bacteria could theoretically be buried on other celestial worlds, he said. If a planet once had life or some other energy sources, microorganisms could be cut off from the surface but still be living a long time, Boetius said.
This 110-foot-wide hole, punched into one of Chicago's best neighborhoods, represents nearly a decade of dashed architectural dreams. Recently, developers gave up trying to build on it, and have started building hills to hide it from the sight of angry neighbors.
This hole, which looks like the aftermath of an attack by either Godzilla or Jehovah, was actually caused by economics. In 2007, it was meant to be a foundation for the tallest tower in the Western Hemisphere. It's 76 feet deep and 110 feet wide, and it was going to put up over a thousand homes right in the center of Chicago. However, after 2007 came 2008, the end of the housing boom, and a huge economic downturn.

The property market is resilient, though, and in 2014, the developer, Shelbourne, raised people's hopes with the idea that the spire could once again go forward. Sadly, the only thing that came of it was the transfer of the deed to the land to Related Midwest.
Streeterville, the neighborhood in which this literal depression is placed, is right in the center of Chicago. It's next to the Navy Pier, a pier extending into Lake Michigan that was once a shipping location but is now a kind of permanent fairground—and a popular spot for tourists and locals. The neighborhood is a good one, and none of its residents enjoyed looking at a metaphoric hell-pit.
Passers-by might have taken the construction crews that started showing up in the last week as a good sign. Sadly, they weren't there to build a tower. They were there to build hills around the hole. These small hills will be covered with trees which will hide the giant hole from view, at least from ground level. It appears, though, that people have temporarily given up on the idea of a new tower in Chicago, and accepted the hole as a semi-permanent part of the neighborhood.

If you're making a vegetarian or vegan main dish for the holidays, you want it to be festive and celebratory.
Stuffing a squash full of tangy, salty and savory ingredients is one way to go; enrobing seasoned mushrooms in a flaky pastry is another. Or you can keep it super simple and present a whole roasted vegetable to carve at the table.
[Start your own Thanksgiving traditions with these simple twists on classic recipes]
Whichever route you choose, you'll be happy with one of these recipes from our archives.
Roasted Portobello Mushroom, Pecan and Chestnut Wellington. Impressive, decadent and — plot twist — easy to assemble. (See just how simple it is in this video.) The roasted mushrooms and chestnut-based filling can be refrigerated for up to five days; the whole thing can be assembled and refrigerated for up to three days before baking. You can make this vegan by finding a vegan puff pastry (such as Pepperidge Farm) and using a nondairy cream to seal the pastry.

The union representing employees at the Burnside jail says staffing needs to increase now that a Nova Scotia Supreme Court judge has ruled federal inmates shouldn't spend 23 hours a day in their cells.
The jail's management opened up a day room in part of the jail just days after a Dec. 7 ruling that found the way the jail housed federal inmates was "unreasonable," according to the union.
Correctional officers filed a work refusal Dec. 10 after learning of the change and the union says staffers continue to fear for their safety now that they're supervising federal offenders as they socialize in a common area.
"The working conditions are more dangerous now," said Jason MacLean, a vice-president with the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union.
'Somebody is going to get killed'
"They've been saying somebody is going to get killed. They feel somebody is going to get hurt in that area because it's a highly-volatile space."
The Department of Justice says it does not discuss operational details for security reasons.
A statement from the department issued Friday says federal inmates have access to their regular privileges, can have visitors and are under no blanket restrictions or a lockdown.
Jason MacLean, a vice-president with the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union who also works as a correctional officer, says the jail kept federal inmates isolated and separated from each other due to safety concerns. (CBC)
Earlier this month, Justice Gerald Moir heard an application from two federal inmates, Dylan Gogan and Dylan Roach, who argued they shouldn't be confined to their cells in what amounted to solitary confinement at Burnside.
The inmates were being kept in their 2-metre by 2.7-metre cells that contain a stool, toilet and mattress.
"Mr. Gogan put it mildly when he said 'it's certainly hard on your mind,'" Moir wrote in his decision.
Moir found the practice wasn't the result of discipline or because they needed protection -- but because the jail had a policy in place for the past year that tried to eliminate federal inmates' access to open dayrooms when they were in custody at the jail in Burnside — whether it be for court appearances or on remand.
The Nova Scotia Supreme Court decision says overcrowding is the only written reason provided for keeping the federal inmates locked up for 23 hours a day.
"No evidence suggests federal prisoners are a greater safety risk. Also, there is no individual assessment. This line of thinking is unreasonable because it is not supported by evidence and it allows for arbitrary infliction of solitary confinement," the ruling says.
The judgment says the inmates were housed in part of the jail known as West 5. Staff and inmates were assaulted in that area in the past, MacLean says.
The Department of Justice says there are now about 220 inmates in the provincial jail, which has a capacity of 322 male offenders.
Union disputes there is overcrowding
MacLean, who works as a correctional officer in Cape Breton, says there wasn't an overcrowding issue in the jail, but the density of particular units can change depending on what type of offenders are there that particular day or week. For instance, people serving an intermittent sentence may be grouped together, as are provincial offenders.
Staff believe the jail went to a one-cell rotation in the area where federal and high-risk offenders stay — where inmates are only allowed out of their cell to shower, make phone calls and exercise one at a time — due to safety concerns in West 5 following assaults on inmates and staff, MacLean says.
"They wouldn't take such a drastic method if they didn't deem it to be unsafe," he said. "Right now it's wide open and [staff] are in a bad position."
'Kites' sent to inmates from prisons
He says staffing needs to increase because now that the day room is open, staff expect inmates will go back to using the common area as a place to assert a pecking order, address grievances between rival gangs and pass along information or messages, known as "kites" from people in penitentiaries.
"Information could be the cause of a riot. It could be the cause of somebody getting stabbed or getting hurt," he said.
The Department of Labour continues to investigate concerns raised by staff at the jail. A spokesperson says the department is meeting with employees and management to find a long-term solution to the issues.
The justice department says it will work with the labour department to address the complaint.

Editorial: “Interbreeding with Neanderthals, or simply breeding?“
It was the discovery that challenged what it is to be human. The Neanderthal genome revealed that our extinct cousin's genes live on in many modern humans, implying that the two species interbred. But a controversial new study casts doubt on those claims of interspecies hanky-panky.
In 2010, Svante Pääbo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and his colleagues sequenced the Neanderthal genome. Their analysis concluded that many modern humans carry a few Neanderthal genes. Only native Africans lack the Neanderthal genes, because Neanderthals did not live in Africa.
Right from the start, there was a problem. Neanderthals and modern humans ultimately evolved from the same ancestral population, so any genes shared by the two species might simply have been inherited from this common ancestor.
Advertisement
“We were very upfront in our papers that this was a possibility,” says Pääbo's colleague David Reich of the Harvard Medical School in Boston.
Drifted apart
Andrea Manica and Anders Eriksson at the University of Cambridge have now built a model to demonstrate a non-interbreeding explanation for the 2010 result.
They began with an ancestral hominin population throughout Africa and Europe. Because of their regional proximity, the hominins in Europe had more genes in common with those of northern Africa than those of southern Africa.
Africa and Europe then became genetically isolated from one another, perhaps triggered by changing climates, says Manica. This allowed the Europeans to evolve into Neanderthals and the Africans to evolve into modern humans. Crucially, though, the modern humans in northern Africa retained genetic similarities with Neanderthals that the southern Africans lacked. Northern Africans ultimately moved into Europe – but they didn't need to interbreed with Neanderthals to share some genes in common with them (see diagram).
“You cannot prove there was never any hybridisation,” says Manica. “But none of the evidence [for hybridisation] is convincing.”
Shuffled up
Reich and Pääbo disagree with the new formulation. They say recent analyses actually firm up the case for interbreeding. Most tellingly, Reich and his colleagues have an upcoming paper in PLoS Genetics that suggests non-Africans have shared genes in common with Neanderthals for only a few tens of thousands of years. If correct, this means these genes cannot predate the origin of Neanderthals, around 320,000 years ago.
His team examined the genomes of modern Europeans to work out how much the Neanderthal-like genes had been shuffled around. The greater the degree of shuffling, the longer they must have been a part of the genome. He found that there was limited gene movement, implying that they entered the European genome between 65,000 and 47,000 years ago – around the time modern humans left Africa.
The evidence for interbreeding is growing, but Manica and Eriksson's study shows we should still consider the alternatives, says Joshua Akey of the University of Washington in Seattle.

Apr 09, 2014

Rails' history with front-end asset management is somewhat complex, involving a mixture of gems and manual file management. Fortunately, there's now a better way—Bower.
Rails 4.0.4 depends on version 2.2.x of the jquery-rails gem which in turn bundles 1.9.1 of JQuery. Does that make any sense? The latest official release of angular-ui-bootstrap-rails is 0.9.0, which is at least a version behind the current release of the Angular UI bootstrap directives. When will it be updated? chosen-rails version 1.1.0 bundles an old version of chosen-jquery that has never been officially released. What?
As recent as a year and a half ago, this mess was the only sane way to manage front-end assets in a Rails app. You'd have to create a Rails Engine inside a gem that made the assets available.
When you want to use an asset in your Rails app, you have to navigate the insanity above to figure out what version you are using. If what you want isn't provided by a gem, the “best practice” was to just download the files and throw them in vendor/assets . If your assets had inter-dependencies, you better watch out. And if you had a non-Ruby application - forget about it.
Now, there's a better way—Bower.
Bower was created by Twitter to manage front-end assets. It's not particular to Rails (and, like many JavaScript command-line tools, it uses NodeJS), but it works similarly to RubyGems and Bundler. You simply create a file in your project that describes what packages you want, and use the bower command-line app to install them. Bower also knows about inter-asset dependencies. Most importantly, Bower allows you to specify directly what version of an asset you want.
I'm not sure why Rails doesn't provide a better tool for this. Perhaps someday it will, but for now, Bower is going to make your life so much easier, especially if you use a lot of front-end assets, or need to share private assets between your apps.
Setting it up
The handy bower-rails gem creates some Rake tasks for you, but also allows you to specify your dependencies in a succinct Gemfile-like format (called, naturaly, Bowerfile ).
In your Gemfile :
gem 'bower-rails'
It's important to note that this doesn't include the bower command-line app, it just calls into it. You'll need to install bower, likely with npm install bower (which requires installing Node and NPM. I know that's a potential yak-shaving thing, but it'll be worth it).
Then place Bowerfile in your root directory. Here's an example of one that uses AngularJS, version 1.2.13:
asset 'angular', '1.2.13' asset 'angular-route' asset 'angular-resource' asset 'angular-mocks' asset 'angular-ui-bootstrap-bower'
You then install them with rake bower:install . If there are any verison incompatibilities, they will generate errors, just like you'd see in Bundler. Everything gets downloaded to vendor/assets/bower_components by default. Because this isn't standard Rails, you'll need to add this to your asset pipeline configuration in config/application.rb :
config.assets.paths << Rails.root.join("vendor","assets","bower_components")
And, finally, add your newly-managed assets to application.js :
//= require angular/angular //= require angular-resource/angular-resource //= require angular-route/angular-route //= require angular-ui-bootstrap-bower/ui-bootstrap.js //= require angular-ui-bootstrap-bower/ui-bootstrap-tpls.js
That's it! Now, your front-end assets can be managed in a sane way. But this is only part of it. Because Bower is so simple, it's easy to use it to manage internal, private assets that you don't (or can't) share with the outside world.
Managing Private Assets
I work at Stitch Fix, and we have several applications that serve many different purposes. Still, they all interact with our inventory in various ways. Although much of that information is stored in a shared database, the official color swatches of our inventory aren't stored there. They had been copied between various apps. We're now using Bower to share them. This way, when we add new colors or update the swatches, the whole team knows, and we can roll out the updates in an organized way.
Here's how to set that up.
Since a Bower version string can be a git url, a value like git@github.com/stitchfix/colors#1.0.3 will tell Bower to get assets from the stitchfix/colors repo, at whatever version is tagged 1.0.3. All we have to do is put a small file named bower.json into that repo:
{ "name": "colors", "version": "1.0.3", "main": [ "colors.css" ], "dependencies": { }, "devDependencies": { }, "ignore": [ "**/.*", "bower_components", "test" ] }
In your Bowerfile , you just use the git url:
asset 'colors', 'git@github.com/stitchfix/colors#1.0.3'
And, we add it to application.css.scss :
#= colors/colors
That's it! Now you can manage internal assets without RubyGems in a sane way. This means that all your front-end assets, public and private, are managed from one clear location, and you can re-use your internal assets for non-Ruby apps, to boot.

A Bainbridge Island teacher is giving a lesson that has parents on edge. The lesson plan: Boys can't play with Legos.
The Bainbridge Island Review reports that Karen Keller, a kindergarten teacher at Blakely Elementary, is tackling the issue of gender equity by not allowing the boys in her class to play with Legos.
“I always tell the boys, ‘You're going to have a turn,'” Keller told the Review. “And I'm like, ‘Yeah, when hell freezes over' in my head.”
“I tell them, ‘You'll have a turn' because I don't want them to feel bad,” she said.
The Lego-restricted lesson plan doesn't make a whole lot of sense for KIRO Radio's Dori Monson.
“Maybe they feel bad because you tell them they are going to have a turn when you don't intend to give them a turn,” Dori said.
“If I was a parent of a boy in that class, I'd get them out of there … we've gone insane in our public schools,” he said. “This Bainbridge Island kindergarten class is just another example of how insane it's all gotten.”
The restriction is personal for Dori, who has three daughters. For him, Legos are for everybody.
“At the Monson house, when my girls were little, we had a huge amount of Duplos,” he said. “The thing we loved doing with the Duplos was building a tower as tall as possible. We got it up to as tall as I could reach — and I'm not the tallest guy. Then I put my daughter on my shoulders and she tried to top it off. Then we got out a chair. We did that stuff all the time.”
“As the father of three daughters, my girls enjoyed the Legos and Duplos,” Dori said.
Keller told the Review that her ban on Legos is a way to pursue gender equity. She noticed that boys in her class often gravitated toward the Legos. Girls, on the other hand, may not have felt as comfortable getting into them, and usually played with crayons or dolls. Keller hopes that by giving girls special access to the blocks, it will improve their spacial and math skills.
But Legos know no gender, according to Dori, who believes that sometimes girls do like the more stereotypical girly things, and boys actually like boyish things.
“Why? Why do we have to change things like that?” Dori asked. “If girls want to play with dolls — and my girls were never into dolls — but if girls want to play with dolls and boys want to play with Legos, why do we have adults in the public schools who feel like they have to make a social statement about gender equity?”
While the KIRO Radio host applauded the effort to improve math skills with girls, he maintained that Legos aren't a tool for a social statement, especially one where kids are thrown in the middle.
“That's fine, but why deny boys that?” he said. “Even though I'm a father of girls and I'm a coach of girls, why do we have to tear down boys to elevate girls? Why would we lie to boys and say ‘you're going to have a turn?'”
“If some girls would rather play with dolls, who cares?” Dori added. “Let them play with dolls.”
I once spent 23 hours on a flight over to Asia. About 10 hours in to it, the very real thought popped in to my head that I may lose my mind and just go nuts. That was on a vacation. Can't imagine being stuck in a bus for 50 hours on my way to work. Interpol made it though, 3 cancelled shows later, Philly was their first stop post-snowpocalypse, and they were anxious to play to a sold-out Union Transfer crowd.
Wasting no time with silly little formal introductions, they came crashing out of the gate with the epic “Say Hello To The Angels.” It led off a cinematic and varied set, featuring newer cuts from El Pintor sprinkled lightly in to tracks from their entire catalogue. I like the new album, don't get me wrong, but I appreciate the willingness to stay away from playing mostly new stuff. As good as they are, Turn On The Bright Lights remains the high point in Interpol's catalogue, and any track from it is bound to be welcomed with open arms. The double whammy of “NYC” and “Stella Was A Diver and She Was Always Down” closed out the night. Not much for talking, Interpol definitely seeming like they were loving being off the bus and dressed to the nines.
Openers A Hundred Waters brought a sort of languid style of electro rock to the table. I don't mean that as a pejorative either. The ethereal vocals, often with no discernible lyrical content, floated gently over synth waves, occasional drum crashes, and gentle guitar strums. I haven't heard their album The Moon Rang Like A Bell yet, but I have a feeling this style plays out a lot nicer in person than through headphones. Both Interpol and A Hundred Waters return to Philly on December 1st for a second sold-out show at Union Transfer.

Game of Thrones addicts, here's some dope for you. A new immersive exhibition themed on your favourite show is taking off on its worldwide tour.
Game of Thrones: The Touring Exhibition will offer an up-close-and-personal display of props, costumes, weapons and set décor sourced straight from the show, forming a 10,000sqft interactive experience. The travelling exhibition is a product of a joint venture between HBO Global Licensing and event-management company GES—in short, it is the official thing.
The space will also feature several themed exhibition areas, with settings such as the wintry landscapes of the North, the tree-lined pathway of King's Road, King's Landing, the conquered city of Meereen, the mysterious House of Black and White, the frozen lands Beyond The Wall, and most importantly, the iconic Iron Throne Room, where you can get a good look at the Westerosi seat of power.
The exhibition will kick off at Barcelona on 28 October 2017, three days before Halloween, at the Museu Marítim. It will go on till 7 January 2018. Tickets start at €10 (Rs770) on weekdays for kids of 3–14yrs. Where does it go next? And is it coming to India? They aren't telling anyone yet. So typical.
Watch this space for updates.
Mohammad Zahoor wouldn't exactly call himself an oligarch, he says, but there's an unmistakably oligarchical quality to the way he is speeding along the Kiev expressway. His blue Bentley is slicing through traffic at 90 miles per hour (145 km per hour) in a 50 mile-per-hour zone, followed bumper-to-bumper by a Mercedes SUV. Both vehicles are parting the Ukrainian traffic like it's the proverbial Red Sea, while socialist-era apartment complexes whiz by outside.
Zahoor is sprawled on the backseat next to his wife Kamaliya. She looks gorgeous, he says, in her white diamond-studded dress. Next to the driver sits Igor, the bodyguard. Igor was once a member of former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's personal security team. He glares at every driver who fails to get out of the way quickly enough.
In just 10 minutes, Kamaliya is due to perform at the Palace of Arts in Kiev -- a gala in honor of late Ukrainian fashion designer Mikhail Voronin, who is such an admired icon in Ukraine that 4,000 people are expected to attend the event. Kamaliya will sing one of her songs there. She has opted to perform a ballad.
But Kamaliya the singer is more than just Zahoor's wife -- she's also his pet project. In Ukraine she is a fairly well-known pop star. She combines traditional opera singing with dance pop, which can take some getting used to for Western European ears. She also won the Mrs. World pageant in 2008 and appeared in a film with Sharon Stone, although the movie hasn't been released. Zahoor sees a great deal of potential here. He has finally found something worthwhile to do with his money.
Living the Dream
Zahoor, who is in his late 50s, once owned five steel mills in Ukraine, and when he sold them in 2008 he netted roughly $1 billion (750 million), although he would rather not divulge the exact amount. What does one do with $1 billion in the bank in the midst of the financial crisis? Zahoor invested in two hotels in Kiev and a number of office buildings. He purchased the liberal English-language weekly the Kyiv Post -- along with a TV studio, an airplane, a yacht, two Bentleys, two Mercedes, an Audi S8 and a Range Rover. So what now?
His fellow oligarchs have bought football clubs. That would be one option. Ukrainian top oligarch Rinat Ackhmetov, for instance, owns Shakhtar Donetsk. Ackhmetov brought in a string of Brazilians and in 2009 the team became the first Ukrainian club to win the UEFA Cup. Football isn't Zahoor's cup of tea, but what if, instead of Brazilians, he brought together the best producers, dancers and PR people and made his wife into a top European pop star? Indeed that very night, on the way to the gala, Zahoor revealed his goal: "We intend to send Lady Gaga into retirement."
That might sound fairly outrageous, but Zahoor has been no stranger to success since he left Karachi at the age of 19 and arrived penniless in the Soviet Union to acquire a degree in metallurgical engineering. At the time, it was certainly just as unlikely that he would today become one of the richest men in Ukraine. Kamaliya has talent and has been singing professionally since the age of 11. The rest can be bought.
Return of the Patron
It's quite possible that Zahoor's approach is merely the logical next step, or perhaps even a visionary venture in today's post-financial crisis era, in which the traditional cultural and entertainment models of postwar capitalism depend on patrons of the arts. Most of the films nominated for an Oscar this year received significant financial backing from billionaires and wealthy heirs, including "Argo" and "Zero Dark Thirty." Large art exhibitions would simply cease to exist without private donors, and numerous football clubs in the Champions League depend upon the support of billionaires. Moscow businessman Vladislav Doronin launched a Russian and a German version of the Andy Warhol magazine "Interview," most likely as a plaything for his then-girlfriend, supermodel Naomi Campbell. In an era when even rich Russians consider private yachts and jets passé, the pact made by sheikhs and oligarchs remains the same: money in exchange for recognition -- and a sense of purpose in life.
Zahoor says that as a steel magnate he used to spend his free time at dinner parties with other steel magnates. Today, he enjoys waiting for two hours while his wife gets dressed, so he and Igor the bodyguard can accompany her across the red carpet. Igor's job is to gesture in a broad Russian manner, as if he wanted to drive off the photographers and cameramen, although they are actually an essential part of the game.
It's a shame that it didn't work out today with the red carpet. Despite doing 90 miles per hour on the expressway, they arrived too late. This time it took Kamaliya four hours to put on her makeup.
A Star is Born
Kamaliya, 36, won her first singing contest at the age of 11, back in the days of the Soviet Union. Afterwards, she received a classical musical education including singing and violin lessons. She can sing over three octaves. In 1997, she released her first album, called "Techno Style," which made her popular in Ukraine. Her mother assumed the role of manager. Kamaliya sang duets with Russian crooner Philipp Kirkorov, but her career stagnated. In 2008, she nevertheless managed to become Mrs. World, yet she still oddly resembles one of Zahoor's steel mills: There must be enormous untapped potential somewhere there, but first everything needs to be revamped.
Back at Zahoor's estate, located just outside of Kiev, Kamaliya immediately wants to hear the latest figures from her German manager. Although she sings in English, her pronunciation needs some work.
"This week you're the most-clicked video on YouTube in Spain -- as well as in Poland," says the manager. "In Germany you still have 15,000 clicks a week, which is a lot," he adds, but later it turns out that all of these figures are rather difficult to check. It's this new shadowy world of pop, with its page hits on YouTube, that Zahoor first needs to come to terms with. These new units of measurement are becoming increasingly important, but sadly there's not much money to be earned from clicks. Fortunately that's only of secondary importance here. Furthermore, in the UK, often referred to as the motherland of pop, Kamaliya has made it to the top 40, reaching number six on the charts. That was last year.
To achieve this coup, Zahoor hired London producers Digital Dog, who have worked with Cyndi Lauper, Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus. For her latest album, "Club Opera," which was released a few weeks ago and is primarily designed to take Germany and Western Europe by storm, Zahoor hired Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen, a former member of the now defunct German New Wave band Nena, primarily known for its 1983 hit song "99 Luftballons." Zahoor also hired German singer and entertainer Thomas Anders, who is revered as a big star in Ukraine, to sing a duet with Kamaliya. It's a similar story with Spanish tenor José Carreras, who has been engaged to sing two tracks with the Ukrainian. Zahoor has elaborate videos made in locations like Miami and Mumbai to promote his wife's songs. The billionaire also helped finance the Hollywood film "What About Love" with Sharon Stone. His condition for investing in the project: Kamaliya had to be given a part.
"We can do this," says Zahoor. The pop business isn't that difficult, he figures. So far, he has invested $5 million, but that's just the beginning.
The Diva and the Oligarch
He met the singer back in 2003, when he was still a steel merchant -- already fabulously well-to-do, but uninteresting for a Ukrainian pop diva. He sent her flowers every day until she agreed to marry him.
On the day before the gala, Zahoor returned from the UK with Kamaliya. They had been collaborating on a film about the superrich -- after all, Zahoor knows that his wealth makes his wife more interesting.
That evening in Kiev, yet another TV camera crew is on hand -- this time from Rossiya 1, the pro-Putin channel. They have flown in from Moscow for a few days. The main reason for this is that Zahoor has hired a producer from the Russian network to work as Kamaliya's publicist. That kind of thing is possible in Russia, and since the station enjoys close ties with the government, Kamaliya has already sung for Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.

"Adulthood" redirects here. For other uses, see Adulthood (disambiguation)
Biologically, an adult is a human or other organism that has reached sexual maturity. In human context, the term adult additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a "minor", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country.
Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character.
In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood.
Biological adulthood
A group of adult people
Historically and cross-culturally, adulthood has been determined primarily by the start of puberty (the appearance of secondary sex characteristics such as menstruation in women, ejaculation in men, and pubic hair in both sexes).[1] In the past, a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult, often with this shift being marked by some type of coming-of-age test or ceremony.[2]
After the social construct of adolescence was created, adulthood split into two forms: biological adulthood and social adulthood. Thus, there are now two primary forms of adults: biological adults (people who have attained reproductive ability, are fertile, or who evidence secondary sex characteristics) and social adults (people who are recognized by their culture or law as being adults). Depending on the context, adult can indicate either definition.
Although few or no established dictionaries provide a definition for the two word term biological adult, the first definition of adult in multiple dictionaries includes "the stage of the life cycle of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained".[3][4] Thus, the base definition of the word adult is the period beginning at physical sexual maturity, which occurs sometime after the onset of puberty. Although this is the primary definition of the base word "adult", the term is also frequently used to refer to social adults. The two-word term biological adult stresses or clarifies that the original definition, based on physical maturity, is being used.
The time of puberty varies, but usually begins around 10 or 11 years old. Girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12.[5][6][7] Girls generally complete puberty by 15–17, and boys by age 16 or 17.[7][8] Nutrition, genetics and environment also usually play a part in the onset of puberty.[9]
Legal adulthood
Legally, adulthood typically means that one has reached the age of majority – when parents lose parenting rights and responsibilities regarding the person concerned. Depending on one's jurisdiction, the age of majority may or may not be set independently of and should not be confused with the minimum ages applicable to other activities, such as engaging in a contract, marriage, voting, having a job, serving in the military, buying/possessing firearms, driving, traveling abroad, involvement with alcoholic beverages, smoking, sexual activity, gambling, being a model or actor in pornography, running for President, etc. Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted because of danger for that person, concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior or because of the risk that the young person causes damage (for example, at an exhibition of fragile items).
One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person, or of enabling a young person to carry out that act, by selling, renting out, showing, permitting entrance, allowing participation, etc. There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling. Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a legal guardian, or just by an adult. Sometimes there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation.
Using the example of pornography, one can distinguish between:
being allowed inside an adult establishment
being allowed to purchase pornography
being allowed to possess pornography
another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person pornography, see disseminating pornography to a minor
being a pornographic actor: rules for the young person, and for other people, regarding production, possession, etc. (see child pornography)
With regard to films with violence, etc.:
another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person a film; a cinema being allowed to let a young person enter
The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age. Niger, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon define adulthood at age 15, but marriage of girls at an earlier age is common.[10]
In most of the world, including most of the United States, India and China, the legal adult age is 18 (historically 21) for most purposes, with some notable exceptions:
Social construction of adulthood
In contrast to biological perspectives of aging and adulthood, social scientists conceptualize adulthood as socially constructed.[11][12] While aging is an established biological process, the attainment of adulthood is social in its criteria. In contrast to other perspectives that conceptualize aging and the attainment of adulthood as a largely universal development, regardless of context, nation, generation, gender, race, or social class, social scientists regard these aspects as paramount in cultural definitions of adulthood.[13]
Further evidence of adulthood as a social construction is illustrated by the changing criteria of adulthood over time. Historically, adulthood in the U.S. has rested on completing one's education, moving away from the family of origin, and beginning one's career.[14][15][16] Other key historical criteria include entering a marriage and becoming a parent. These criteria are social and subjective; they are organized by gender, race, ethnicity, social class, among other key identity markers. As a result, particular populations feel adult earlier in the life course than do others.[17][18][19][20]
Contemporary experiences of and research on young adults today substitute more seemingly subjective criteria for adulthood which resonate more soundly with young adults' experiences of aging.[18][21] The criteria are marked by a growing "importance of individualistic criteria and the irrelevance of the demographic markers" of normative conceptions of adulthood."[22]:230 In particular, younger cohorts' attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria: gaining a sense of responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence.[23][24]
Religion
According to Jewish tradition, adulthood is reached at age 13 (the minimum age of the Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah) for Jewish boys and girls; they are expected to demonstrate preparation for adulthood by learning the Torah and other Jewish practices. The Christian Bible and Jewish scripture contain no age requirement for adulthood or marrying, which includes engaging in sexual activity
The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, "A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age, and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age, cannot enter a valid marriage".[25] According to The Disappearance of Childhood by Neil Postman, the Christian Church of the Middle Ages considered the age of accountability, when a person could be tried and even executed as an adult, to be age 7.

I have this tree that I've been growing out (well…..I have many trees, but this one is in the ground, it was a volunteer, maybe deposited by bird trying to poop on my head, a southern hackberry, a name I prefer to sugarberry, which sounds like some special technique practiced on a sugar daddy, ummmm…..anyway, it's a celtis lævigata that has grown too big, much like this sentence) that needs to be collected. Like I said, big, and in the ground. I meant to dig it out about two years ago. I got sick though, and that's all I have to say about that. But this isn't about collecting it. Maybe soon, but I'll need help with it. Today's post is a quick one, easy peasy, with only a few big words and two or three diagrams and illustrations. What I'm after today are called “suckers”. No, really, suckers. I think that they're called that because it's believed that they “suck” the energy from the main tree, growing off the roots as they do.
There are different names we could use, adventitious shoots, basal shoots, root sprouts, water sprouts, but I like suckers. Who doesn't like a good sucker, huh? A tree that does this is called surculose. Whatever that means……..ok, I had to look it up, it's root (heh heh) is Latin for sucker- surculosus plus the ending ‘ose. Which doesn't help much, does it? Anyway, I thought the Latin word for “sucker” was “fellator”?
Let me explain what I'm actually doing. We have a southern hackberry. Oh, by the way, here's a “fact” that most people are taught in school that is untrue (like the one that human blood is blue until it hits the oxygen in the air). We were taught that a trees roots only grow as wide as the canopy.
The real fact is that the roots grow 2-3 times as wide as the canopy. This is important on our hackberries. You see, on the roots (and many other trees, like elms or bananas) are buds (technically meristems, cells which can differentiate into various organs, like more roots or shoots) that will sprout into new trees. In this way, one tree can create its own thicket or stand or forest even, without having to produce seed. Which might explain the low fruit production on many celtis; it might take less energy to reproduce this way than making fruit. A stand of trees like this are genetically identical and the actual term is a “genet”. The most famous example is the quaking aspen colony (its called “Pando”) in Utah that is sometimes considered the largest organism (by mass) on the planet with 47,000 individual trees connected by one root system. It covers 106 acres (43 hectares). The scientist believe this colony is anywhere between 80,000- 1,000,000 years old That's right, a million years old!
The problem with the trees being genetically identical is that if something external affects one tree (say, a bug or a disease) it could wipe out the whole colony. Which many people believe is happening to Pando. It's dying. They just don't know what the cause is, whether it's drought, insects, or disease. Or a combo of all three. Sad really.
How does all this relate to bonsai? We can collect these “root suckers” and make bonsai of course.
They grow like this in the ground.
The idea is to pick some of the better ones and cut them out.
Hopefully you have some more roots…. …..but they'll still grow from the cut ends. There's a rock embedded in the base of this tree.
This one is just cool. Good movement.
But the best use of small ones, like I'm collecting today, are for making little forests or groves, with connected roots. For those so interested, the soil is 1/2 perlite, 1/2 pinebark. Nothing special except it'll grow roots.
It's almost like a raft, but the idea behind the raft is for a fallen tree to grow roots where the trunk is touching the ground and the other side to grow new trunk from the branches.
I'm not sure where the front is yet….
It'll be cool. Very natural looking. I'll probably add more when it goes into a proper pot, I have plenty more trees to choose from.
Not bad for a backyard nursery and a “weed” tree. Generally, you want to pass up collecting small trees like this for unless your plan is to grow them larger (a good ten year project) or if you want to make little forests like this. Or if you want small trees I guess. What you generally want are bigger trees with character and movement. Like this one- which is going to make a fantastic tree, can't wait to work on it.
One last aesthetic tip. When making a forest or clump, the fattest trunk should be the tallest tree. It's “older” and therefore should be taller.
Get out there now (or when the ground thaws I guess….) and find yourself some root connected trees and put together a cool little forest. Make sure you get permission first though.
After care for something like this: no fertilizer until new growth hardens off, but plenty of water (hence the heavy organic component). I also tend to keep them in the shade and protected from the wind to minimize water loss due to evaporation. I'll keep you up to date, cross your fingers, hopefully I get good results (that's the cue for the Perpetual Intermediates out there to tell me that they'll all die because I didn't get a “proper” root ball. Go ahead, say it, sign your name to it, though, and own it. I'll publish your reply)
Next time, a small cypress forest and a Chinese elm or two.
I have always thought of myself as a Southerner. Born and raised in the Florida panhandle, I've lived in Arkansas, Tennessee and Georgia. I have a strong sense of belonging to the land and its culture. But as a photographer representing the South, I want to dig into my own Southern identity a bit more. I want to know exactly what I'm claiming when I call myself a “Southern artist.” Do I believe in the Southern trinity of Elvis, Jesus, and Robert E. Lee? Could I swear it, like Scarlett O'Hara did, with God as my witness?
Then, the unthinkable happened. Dylann Roof walked into a evening prayer service at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, and murdered nine church members before fleeing the scene. Almost instantly after his arrest, an image appeared online showing Roof posing with a handgun in front of a Confederate battle flag. I felt an immediate pull away from my Southerness and a sense of shame for our broken past.
To look intently on the South, I needed to look at the darkest part of our history to see if there was any truth or beauty I can abide with. So I sought out the Sons of Confederate Veterans and those who still wave the rebel flag. I spent time with people labeled as racists, rednecks, country folk, and in some cases, those labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center as extremists. I spent time with and photographed people caught up, sometimes incidentally, in public reenactments or “tributes” to the Confederacy. I also spent time with authors, historians, and documentarians to level the playing field. Through some digging, I even discovered that my own third great-grandfather, William Kelso(e), fought for the Confederacy in the 19th Alabama Infantry, Company B.
As I photographed Confederate memorials and rallies across the Bible Belt, I realized I was witnessing a dying culture. “As God Is My Witness” is an attempt to document what remains of this version of the South today, not some glorified Old South of the past. Both as a Christian and as a photographer, my task is to listen and practice empathy, to peer beyond the veil of America's only “felt" history and accept it.
“We can't rewrite history. But we can correct some of the evils of history.”
— John Cummings, founder of the Whitney Plantation Museum, Wallace, Louisiana
After finishing my project, I sat it aside and tried to put some space between myself and the distorted visions of Tara that I had photographed over the past year. During that downtime, I came across two pieces in The New Yorker. One article described a black lawyer in Montgomery, Bryan Stevenson, who had plans to raise a monument to commemorate the victims of “racial terror lynching” in the South. The other — a 12-minute documentary film — told of a white lawyer, John Cummings, who had reopened the doors of the Whitney Plantation to tell its story of slavery in Louisiana. What struck me most about these two men was their ability to look at our past, warts and all, and enter into a grand conversation about it, so that healing can begin. Our history of slavery, of lynchings, of convoluted ideas about human rights … are we as Southerners supposed to turn a blind eye to all this and struggle through proudly? I think not.
In the film, Cummings says, “It may be that you're not forgetting because you never knew … because of a conscious elimination from history.”
As heavy-laden Confederate sentiment dissipates and the landscape of the South begins to wear in a brand-new groove of post-Civil War enlightenment, we can't all go on thinking that the Confederates in the attic will disappear if only we shut our eyes just tight enough and stop up our ears so we do not hear the faintest of rebel yells. What would it look like to take on the task of looking our neighbors in the face today, no matter which side of history they are on, and with God as our witness, loving them well now, to show the world a less bitter South than history books have taught us?
South Korea military and intelligence officials said the probability North Korea conducted a hydrogen bomb test is low after Pyongyang announced it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Photo by Yonhap
SEOUL, Jan. 6 (UPI) -- The probability North Korea conducted a hydrogen bomb test is low, South Korea military and intelligence officials said Wednesday, after Pyongyang announced it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb.
The magnitude of the seismic activity is too weak, South Korean television network MBC reported.
According to Seoul's National Intelligence Service, "There is a possibility a hydrogen bomb test was not conducted, judging by the size of the quake," after seismic monitors detected a 5.1 tremor near the Punggye-ri test site near the China border.
Hydrogen bombs are a hundred times more powerful than other nuclear weapons, and even if the test fails, any experiment would emit several dozens of kilotons of energy into the atmosphere.
RELATED North Korea says it tested hydrogen bomb
But according to Seoul, North Korea's most recent test emitted about 6.0 kilotons of nuclear power, an amount well below the estimated 7.9 kilotons of power that was emitted during North Korea's third test in 2013.
In Washington, White House officials condemned the North Korea test. National Security spokesman Ned Price told Yonhap that while the North's claims of a test could not be verified, the United States condemns any test that is a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.
The North's provocative announcement was equally condemned in China, where Beijing Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China was not warned in advance of the test – unlike previous cases when Pyongyang conducted nuclear experiments, South Korean newspaper Hankyoreh reported.
There is a growing possibility more sanctions could be imposed on North Korea, as was the case in March 2013, when the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2094.
A U.N. official who spoke to South Korea press on the condition of anonymity said it is difficult to conclude what actions could be taken, but most likely any new sanctions would target North Korea's weapons and financial transactions. The Security Council called an emergency meeting for Wednesday.
North Korea also has been testing a submarine-launched ballistic missile, Yonhap reported.
Pyongyang was able to test-launch a SLBM in December, off the eastern coast of the Korean peninsula, an unidentified South Korean government official said, adding the North continues to test SLBMs.
The official did not say whether a submarine was used in the most recent SLBM test.

For those who live with environmental problems every day—mostly low-income, minority, and indigenous populations in America and around the world—every day is Earth Day. While there are programs this Saturday for vulnerable communities, “they're just not getting an equitable level of transmission,” Rogers-Wright said. “And that's been the story for many years in the environmental so-called movement.”
Rogers-Wright derides the “so-called movement” because, he says, the nation's leading environmental groups too often neglect environmental justice communities. Earth Day is a manifestation of that disconnect—an event that, Rogers-Wright derides the “so-called movement” because, he says, the nation's leading environmental groups too often neglect environmental justice communities. Earth Day is a manifestation of that disconnect—an event that, like much of the environmental world , focuses too much on making white people feel good about recycling and driving Pruises than helping those suffering from environmental injustice. “It has turned into a device for the mostly white male-led nonprofit industrial complex to raise money for causes they don't have a plan for,” he said, citing the amorphous fight against climate change and general environmental degradation.
The president of one such leading environmental group agrees. “Right now people might take a styrofoam cup and paint a planet on it with paint that might be tainted with lead,” said Aaron Mair, the Sierra Club's first black president. “ We need to make people uncomfortable, to shatter that convenience.”
Earth Day wasn't supposed to be a corny celebration of green living. Founded in 1970, amid rising awareness of industry's unchecked pollution of the air and water, its organizers aimed to apply the lessons of civil-right activism to the environmental movement. “The original founders of Earth Day literally borrowed pages from the then-happening civil rights movement to engage in righteous civil disobedience, righteous group mass action, to have humanity look at environmental degradation and the degradation of lives of individuals,” Mair said.
In fact, the organizers even made racial equality central to their message. As Brentin Mock At the time, Hayes said that organizers' “goal is not to clean the air while leaving slums and ghettos, nor is it to provide a healthy world for racial oppression and war.” C ivil rights activist Channing Phillips, another organizer, recognized that environmental problems would not be distributed equally: “[R acial] injustice, war, urban blight, and environmental rape have a common denominator in our exploitive economic system.” In fact, the organizers even made racial equality central to their message. As Brentin Mock recounted in Grist , Earth Day coordinator Denis Hayes “wanted to marry science with social justice activism.”
The first Earth Day also marked the environmental movement's break from its white supremacist roots. Last month, on the occasion of the Sierra Club's 125th anniversary, Mair “ Few Sierrans realize that race, population eugenics, and ‘natural order' were critical features and values of our founders and naturalist societies of the late 19th and 20th centuries, which largely blamed environmental degradation on developing and non-European populations.” He added, “ It was not until Earth Day in 1970—nearly eight decades after the Sierra Club's founding—that environmentalism per se arose in response to the crises of ... pollution and environmental degradation.” The first Earth Day also marked the environmental movement's break from its white supremacist roots. Last month, on the occasion of the Sierra Club's 125th anniversary, Mair wrote
The original Earth Day was not only intersectional, it was effective: Historians largely credit the movement that began on that day for the the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency and the eventual passage of the Clean Air and Clean Water acts.
But echoes remain of the environmental movement's ugly history. Anti-immigration groups (FAIR) and NumbersUSA , for example, have played a “major role” at Earth Day events in Dallas. Their argument is that strict immigration policies prevent overpopulation, and thus reduce stress on the environment. When environmental organizations shunned these groups' participation, they had their history thrown back in their faces. “Until fairly recently, The Sierra Club had a similar position and wanted to limit population growth in the United States because of the consequences for the environment,” a FAIR spokesperson told the conservative Daily Caller last year. But echoes remain of the environmental movement's ugly history. Anti-immigration groups Federation for American Immigration Reform
Acknowledging this history is a key step toward a more inclusive Earth Day, Mair argues. “We've contributed to this schism that has historically excluded communities of color,” he said. Owning that history is a critical piece of changing history.” The next step: increasing diversity among event organizers, which is no small feat given that the membership and leadership of the major environmental groups is Earth Day could also return to its roots as a civil rights-inspired protest.

A specter is haunting university history departments: the specter of capitalism.
After decades of “history from below,” focusing on women, minorities and other marginalized people seizing their destiny, a new generation of scholars is increasingly turning to what, strangely, risked becoming the most marginalized group of all: the bosses, bankers and brokers who run the economy.
Even before the financial crisis, courses in “the history of capitalism” — as the new discipline bills itself — began proliferating on campuses, along with dissertations on once deeply unsexy topics like insurance, banking and regulation. The events of 2008 and their long aftermath have given urgency to the scholarly realization that it really is the economy, stupid.
The financial meltdown also created a serious market opportunity. Columbia University Press recently introduced a new “Studies in the History of U.S. Capitalism” book series (“This is not your father's business history,” the proposal promised), and other top university presses have been snapping up dissertations on 19th-century insurance and early-20th-century stock speculation, with trade publishers and op-ed editors following close behind.
The dominant question in American politics today, scholars say, is the relationship between democracy and the capitalist economy. “And to understand capitalism,” said Jonathan Levy, an assistant professor of history at Princeton University and the author of “Freaks of Fortune: The Emerging World of Capitalism and Risk in America,” “you've got to understand capitalists.”
Krauthammer offers a snippet from a New York Times columnist saying that people are "suspicious of complexity," an unnamed Time Magazine blogger who said we're "a nation of dodos," and a nine-year-old New York Times obituary in which a philosopher is credited with offering a "philosophical justification" for conservative ideas. The condescension, I guess, is in the notion that conservative ideas need a philosophical justification. Alexander's examples of condescension are mostly more like simple disagreement. He says that liberals "disregard the policy demands" of conservatives.
Poor babies. If believing that you are right and that people who disagree with you are wrong amounts to condescension, then we are all condescending. Of course, on any given issue, liberals tend to think that they are right. So do conservatives. It's a free country, and people can believe whatever they want. If evidence or reason persuades them that some opinion they hold is wrong, they are free to change it. So at any given moment, we all believe that our own beliefs are correct and anyone who disagrees with us has some explaining to do. Furthermore, if I believe that evidence and reason support my own views, then I also must believe that they do not support the views of those who disagree with me.
So the question naturally arises: how can someone hold a different view than mine on any given issue? Maybe he or she is right and I am wrong--an unhappy possibility that neither liberals nor conservatives keep excessively in mind. But there is no evidence or reason to suppose that liberals are more oblivious to evidence or argument challenging their opinions than conservatives. When was the last time the Wall Street Journal editorial page admitted to doubts about the value of tax cuts? Even if I decide that my current views are wrong, I will change them, and the question of how anyone can disagree with me arises once again.
Three possible answers are that they are misinformed, they are thinking poorly, or they are blinded by self-interest. Or, to put it crudely, they are ignorant, stupid or selfish. There is no evidence that liberals put it that crudely more often than conservatives. In any event, the basic point remains: it is silly to accuse people of arrogance for believing that they are right and that people who disagree with them are wrong. If nothing else, give Weisberg points for guts. It requires no courage to tell Americans that they have "bedrock common sense"--some mystical wisdom that is the gloppiest part of the old theory of American exceptionalism. There is no reason to believe that Americans are wiser, on average, than the citizens of other nations. Weisberg, in fact, makes a good case that the opposite is true. Americans make incompatible demands on the government (cut my taxes, but don't touch my favorite programs), demand change then recoil in horror when they get it, are gulled by transparent absurdities.
I know what you're thinking: what's the big deal about a Halloween sequel, right? I mean, it feels like we get either a Halloween, Friday the 13th, or Nightmare on Elm Street remake/reboot/sequel every 6–8 months. We've sent them into space…into Hell…and into the third dimension. We even did a buddy cop move by pairing up two of them in the same movie. So short of an IMAX-filmed animated musical, there's nothing left to get fans excited about a another Michael Myers go-around.
Nothing except one name: John Carpenter.
In fact, you might be surprised to know that there are a number of reasons for horror aficionados to get pretty excited about this newest trip to Haddonfield. The as-yet-still-untitled new Halloween film, set to be directed by David Gordon Green and from a script by Green and Danny McBride, might just be the saving grace that the franchise has sorely needed.
● Carpenter really likes what Green and McBride pitched to him — and he says you will, too:
“David and Danny both came to my office recently with [Blumhouse producer] Jason Blum and shared their vision for the new movie and …wow! They get it. I think you're gonna dig it. They blew me away.”
● Carpenter is going to serve as executive producer on the sequel, and might even compose the music. This would be the first direct creative involvement Carpenter's had in the Halloween franchise since 1982's Myers-less Halloween III: Season of the Witch.
● You can forget about serial killer cults and Busta Rhymes, because this Halloween sequel is going to be a direct follow-up to 1981's Halloween II and will ignore any sequels that came after the first one.
● This Michael Myers won't have supernatural powers. Green and McBride are bringing the character back to his basics, going with a “less-is-more” approach to his backstory, too. (Spoiler Alert: we'll know just how good Green and McBride are as writers when we see how they write away a bullet to each eye and a gas explosion in an operating room).
● If the most recent announcement holds, then this will be the only film in the Halloween franchise to actually be released on Halloween. In fact, this is the first Halloween movie to open in the month of October since 1989's Halloween 5.
Dimension's new Halloween sequel is tentatively set for an October 31, 2018 release.

New rules for bicycle delivery riders take effect Tuesday in New York City.
The new commercial bike law was approved in October after complaints about bikers speeding and weaving down sidewalks.
Commercial bicyclists are now required to carry an identification card and wear helmets and reflective upper body clothing with the business' name and cyclist's ID number on the back.
Businesses could be fined $100 or more if they fail to provide riders with helmets, headlights and bells.
Commercial bicyclists must also obey all traffic laws, including yielding to pedestrians, riding in the direction of traffic and stopping at all red lights and stop signs, among others, and must take a safety course.
In addition, the law beefs up enforcement, giving Department of Transportation agents the power to write tickets to riders in addition to police.

The Boys From The Oak Street Basement Are Increasing Their Touring Schedule — Including A Show Thursday At Last Exit Live — With A Smattering Of Songs Likely To Be Included On Their Next Album
By Melissa Corbin
Special for Modern Times Magazine
Nov. 19, 2013 — Small Leaks Sink Ships — also known as the boys from the Oak Street Basement — are back for a show at Phoenix's Last Exit Live, 717 S. Central Ave. on Thursday at 9 p.m. Their sound is bigger and brighter than ever, as they have been feverishly working together on their upcoming, yet to named, album.
The new album is scheduled to drop in spring of 2014, complete with passionate lyrics and poignant instrumentals. But for now the band that evokes the sound of a small symphony, not the sound of your average rock band, is just wetting the beaks of their loyal following.
After years rife with personal challenges — car wrecks and a cancer diagnosis among them — the process of making the new album was described as emotional and transformative.
"It's been a journey," said London Vanrooy, the band's vocalist and drummer. "Spiritually, emotionally, musically. All of us have embarked on this journey together with the new release as the result."
Thursday, Small Leaks Sink Ships will be playing a set comprised mostly of tracks meant for the upcoming release at Last Exit Live, before bringing their show on the road to Albuquerque N.M. Friday, followed by a show in Santa Fe Saturday, and then back through Los Angeles on Nov. 30.
The band is using some different instruments and samples on this upcoming release, and the band hopes for some new support for their organic sound.
"We were told it was renaissance to create our own samples from scratch," said Judd Hancock, a hint of a chuckle in his voice. "No one does it anymore; we enjoy featuring unrecognizable sounds."
Emotions run high throughout the band, resulting in bursts of inspiration and cohesive jam sessions.
"It's purely generational, but I think our greatest influence has been punk," said Van Rooy "We all listened to it at one point. So when we sit down to write and we've been listening to punk or post-rock or any genre… We won't imitate it, we will draw emotions from it and put them down on paper."
"I play with my guitar or my pedals more, depending on my mood and what I've been listening to," added Rafael Macias.
"When we are writing heavily, we sit down and meditate together," said Jim Mandel. "It organizes our thoughts and we can calm our brains down collectively. I think this time we're going to feel more satisfied than we ever have before at the end of it all. The sound is finally coming across the way we want it to. We work well together, especially with what everyone has been through."
The upcoming Last Exit Live show is 21 and up, and Small Leaks will be joined by New Mexico based AsInWe who are sporting their new album As Above So Below, as well as locals Celebration Guns, and Morning Theft.

ERBIL, Kurdistan Region — The jailed leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), Abdullah Ocalan, has called on the PKK and Turkish government to end ongoing clashes and resume negotiations, which were planned to lead to permanent peace in the country.
The Civil Peace Department, a government-backed organization which supervises the peace process between Ankara and the PKK, published a letter written by Ocalan in which the jailed leader slammed the negotiating partners for the “bloodshed.”
“Our (PKK) fighters, leaders of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and the Turkish government's officials failed to administer and commit themselves to the peace negotiations,” Ocalan wrote from his prison on Imrali Island in the Sea of Marmara, calling for an immediate ceasefire.
Ocalan said the two sides should immediately go back to the negotiating table and “set a timeline” for the implementation of the peace process.
The Turkish government and Ocalan struck an agreement in 2013 which would gradually end nearly 30 years of violence between the two sides, and pave the way towards a permanent peace treaty.
However, fighting between Turkish and PKK forces resumed following a bombing in the Turkish-Syrian border town of Suruc in which 32 people were killed and 104 others were wounded on July 20.
The PKK later took responsibility for killing two policemen the group accused of masterminding the bombing and having links with the Islamic State.
Turkey responded to the killings with a resumption of bombings against PKK targets in Iraq.
Five people were also killed on Friday in clashes between Turkish security forces and PKK guerillas in Silopi, Sirnak province.
Selahettin Demirtas, the leader of the pro-Kurdish HDP, who is currently in Brussels for talks with EU officials, also called on Saturday for both sides to resume talks, and urged Ankara to allow Ocalan visitations.
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Yalcin Akdogan said in a newspaper article earlier that the HDP could no longer visit Ocalan since they had “betrayed the peace process.”
Akdogan said Ankara would resume talks directly with Ocalan.
Beijing is ramping up a years-long effort to shift to cleaner fuels
BEIJING, Oct 20 (Reuters) - China will further limit construction of coal-fired power plants by cancelling some projects that were already approved this year, its national energy bureau said on Thursday, as Beijing ramps up a years-long effort to shift to cleaner fuels.
China will postpone construction of some coal-fired plants that have already secured approval, in addition to taking other measures, said a statement posted on the National Energy Administration (NEA) website.
The agency will also stop the building of any project that started this year and reassess the schedule for those that started in 2015, it said.
It was not immediately clear how many plants this might involve.
The NEA will also limit the capacity of some big coal power projects in major coal producing regions that are still under construction, it said.
In Xinjiang, the planned output for the East Junggar Basin Coal Electricity Complex plant will be cut in half, while in Inner Mongolia, the Xinlin Gol project capacity will be capped at 7.3 million KwH per year by 2020, it said.
The plan is an expansion of the government's prolonged effort to produce power from renewable energy such as solar and wind, and wean the country off coal, which accounts for the majority of the nation's power supply.

Norwich City linked with Celtic midfielder Beram Kayal and Swansea striker Danny Graham
Beram Kayal Archant
Norwich City were today reported to be preparing a bid for £5m-rated Celtic midfielder Beram Kayal.
Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in.
Manager Chris Hughton was in Glasgow yesterday to watch the SPL champions beat Motherwell 1-0.
Gary Hooper's 18th goal of the season and a penalty save from Fraser Forster gave Celtic victory, but one national newspaper claims Hughton was there was to assess Kayal, back in the side after recovering from a series of injuries.
Under contract until the summer of 2015, the Israeli international played 71 minutes before heading off for the two week winter break.
Sky Sports also claimed today that the Canaries and Reading had made approaches for Swansea City striker Danny Graham.
Graham joined the Swans in the summer of 2011 when Brendan Rodgers paid Watford more than £3million for his signature.
Meanwhile, City midfielder Jacob Butterfield, back from his loan spell with Bolton, is reported to be signing for Crystal Palace on a month's loan.
Butterfield, 22, has made just two first team appearances for the Canaries since his summer move from Barnsley, both in the Capital One Cup.
In this one, I'm the general manager ... for every team. This isn't me projecting picks, this is me making them, for three full rounds, based on what's best for each team at that slot. Thus the "A" grade. (I know, I know.)
Please read the ground rules:
1. At each slot, I make a pick in the best interest of only the team with the pick. I won't pass on a player at No. 4 just because I like the team better at No. 5.
2. No trades unless they're already done. I note team needs, and I try to address them, but like the draft, value can supersede need.
3. Again: I'm not projecting. It's more a look at where I see value up and down the board.
As with previous years', there's a team-by-team look below, as well as a pick-by-pick version so you can see how the order of the picks progressed and get an idea of who was off the board when each team selected.
Picks in order, Rounds 1-3
Top needs: QB, DE, OT, WR
Round 1 (1) QB Jameis Winston, Florida St.
Round 2 (34) OT D.J. Humphries, Florida
Round 3 (65) DE Mario Edwards, Florida St.
Analysis: There's no debate in my war room about the No. 1 pick. It's not just because I think Winston is more NFL-ready than any other QB in the draft, and thus it serves me as GM to take him and perhaps help my own job security; it's about talent, and I'm willing to bet on Winston's here. We make this pick and start planning with the goal of Winston as our Week 1 starter. I think we have the weapons to help him succeed early. We also have a clear need for a tackle, and I'm happy to see Humphries available at No. 34, though I would have taken Jake Fisher ahead of him (the Titans grabbed him at No. 33). Humphries could push to start at right tackle. Edwards isn't a great pass-rusher, but I think he's really tough to move in the run game and is a pretty good value at No. 65. My reasoning for having WR as a need is that that depth chart looks much different if either Vincent Jackson (now 32 years old) or Mike Evans is on the shelf for any period of time.
Here's a site which we think all movie fans will come to love – MovieSociety (MS) is the newest specialized movie DDL (direct download links) resource on the block. The site, which at a glace resembles the look and feel of a release blog combined with a private torrent tracker, features an intuitive user interface, powerful search features, fast navigation and of course, an ever expanding library of movies with XviD, Blu Ray, 720p and 1080p quality video hosted on multiple cyber locker services such as FileSonic, Duckload and FileServe. MovieSociety appears to be a site written from scratch (not using a common template) and is currently in beta test stage. Good news is that registrations are open during this phase and interested readers are now able to sign up for an account to test drive MS even before official launch.
Below is a brief description of MS which highlights the core concept and basic features in the site (quoted from homepage):
MovieSociety is an advanced tool for movie lovers. Not only does it allow you to search for movies by actors, directors, writers, language, and many more but it allows you to view all the required details about the movie in an easy and intuitive manner! MovieSociety also provides a unique way of providing you the movies; by using a selection of excellent hosts like FileServe, FileSonic and Duckload as well as special DLC container files used by jDownloader, we can not only provide a huge amount of movies readies for you to download, but we can also ensure that they stay up far longer than other indexing sites! Watch out for our jDownloader HOWTO!
Although it's just been a few days since beta launch, MovieSociety already indexes close to 1000 movies both old and new. This includes English as well as foreign films from a number of different countries across the globe. All of this file are uploaded to multiple one click hosting services and most come with a DLC container for easy downloading using JDownloader.
Registrations for MovieSociety are currently open. However, don't expect the doors to remain open forever – according to the owner site will probably go invite only once the beta phase completes.

The inventor of an improved telephonic earphone
Nathaniel Baldwin (December 1, 1878 – January 19, 1961)[1] was the inventor of an improved telephonic earphone amongst many other inventions, and a supporter of the early Mormon fundamentalist movement.
Biography [ edit ]
Baldwin was born in Fillmore, Millard County, Utah to Nathaniel B. Baldwin, a native of Ontario, Canada, and Margaret Ohler, a native of Philadelphia.[1] Baldwin's family were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and his mother was his father's second polygamous wife. As a child, he was interested in technology and built his own bicycle and steam engine.[2]
Teaching [ edit ]
Baldwin studied at Brigham Young Academy (BYA), Utah State Agricultural College,[2] and then Stanford University, receiving a degree in electrical engineering.[3] He then returned to BYA to teach physics and theology and remained after its name changed to Brigham Young University (BYU). Though the LDS Church had officially discontinued the practice of polygamy in 1890, and again in 1904, fellow professor John Tanner Clark convinced Baldwin the church was making a mistake. Since the LDS Church owned BYU, this led to Baldwin's firing and Clark's excommunication in 1905.[2]
Inventing and business [ edit ]
Baldwin worked at remote hydroelectric plants at the Snake Creek near Heber City and in East Mill Creek Canyon.[3] He was also an electrician and air compressor operator while he experimented with sound amplification using compressed air. He used an idea for a telephonic feature to invent a more sensitive telephonic receiver in 1910, and later after surpassing testing standards, sold production versions on contract to the U.S. Navy. His first ones were made by hand in his kitchen and, despite the Navy's suggestion, never patented the headset assembly because he considered their invention "trivial." The earpieces were themselves patented, first in 1910, and the improved versions in 1915.[4] "Headphones", two telephonic receivers on a headbow, were already in use by early wireless radio operators as early as 1906-1907, prior to Baldwin's telephonic receiver improvement and patent in 1910.
In 1914, Baldwin started a business in East Millcreek, Utah called The Baldwin Radio Company. He powered the plant and the neighborhood through a hydroelectric generator which he made out of bicycle wheels and piano wire. The company peaked at 150 employees and $2 million in annual sales in the 1920s.[3] One legend tells that Philo Farnsworth built his first television in Baldwin's factory.[3]
Mormon fundamentalism and company bankruptcy [ edit ]
Baldwin used his success to help support the post-Manifesto polygamous movement in the 1920s. Many officers in his company were leading polygamists, including Lorin C. Woolley, John Y. Barlow, Israel Barlow, Leslie Broadbent, and Lyman Jessop.[5] During this time, these employees drew up plans to create the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church) in southern Utah.[2] He is considered the most important financial support to the Mormon fundamentalist community before his company failed.[6]
Unwise investments, often with fellow supporters of polygamy, led to Baldwin's company's bankruptcy in 1924.
In a new business venture with his polygamous friends, Baldwin began selling stock for the Omega Investment Company, which led to his conviction for mail fraud in 1930 and two-year sentence at McNeil Island Federal Prison. After this period, Baldwin was never again able to recapture his previous success.[3]
Despite his doctrinal support of polygamy, he married only once, to Elizabeth Ann Butler. They were the parents of seven children.[1]

The Toronto Transit Commission says more than 100 of its employees have been dismissed or have resigned over benefits claims irregularities.
Toronto police laid criminal charges in July 2015 against the owner of Healthy Fit, a health care products and service provider that TTC employees frequented.
It is alleged that receipts were provided to employees by Healthy Fit for claim reimbursement where no product or service was obtained, or where receipt amounts were inflated.
Story continues below advertisement
It is also alleged that Healthy Fit and the employee making the claim would then share the money paid out by the TTC's insurer at the time, Manulife Financial.
Investigators are continuing to interview employees who filed benefits claims involving Healthy Fit and the TTC says they will be dismissed if the evidence shows the benefits plan was defrauded.
To date, the TTC says 82 employees have been fired and more than 20 have resigned or retired to avoid firing, and it expects those numbers to grow.
Arabs and Muslims hoping to hear directly from Donald Trump on his new policy on Jerusalem on Wednesday must have been shocked to witness the United States president deliver an Israeli speech instead. The tone was Trump, but the words and spin were all Benjamin Netanyahu.
Trump's claim that officially recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was merely "recognising reality" is pure Israeli reasoning - central to the occupation's strategy of creating facts on the ground.
Palestinians know this. Arabs know this. The international community knows it, too. They all know that if you give an inch of Jerusalem to Israel, it will take the lot, and in the process, undermine peace efforts and cause havoc.
The US Congress also knew this, which is why they put a waiver clause in the original 1995 US Embassy Act in the first place. Three previous US presidents also knew it, which is why they used the waiver to avoid implementing it for more than 20 years. And everyone - from the world leaders who called Trump to warn him, to the state department officials and diplomats who advised him against his decision - knew that as well.
Netanyahu knows it too. Did Trump? Maybe, but it was too late. He had drunk Netanyahu's Koolaid.
If there was ever doubt in the Arab mind about Israeli tail wagging the US dog, it dissipated with Trump's latest statement on Jerusalem. Within minutes, the Israeli premier appeared smug on television to thank the American president for recognising Jerusalem as capital of the "Jewish state", and encouraged others to follow suit.
For decades, many of ruling elites of Arab states exploited the cause of Palestine and Israeli desecration of Jerusalem for their own interests.
Mahmoud Abbas was furious. He accused the Trump administration of rewarding aggression and inflaming religious extremism. It was a humiliating moment for the Palestinian president who long placed his bets on Washington and the peace process only to see it destroyed with one speech.
For all practical matter, the speech is the product of President Trump's closest advisers since before he became president and the trio entrusted for the "Peace Process": David Freedman, Trump's ambassador to Israel, Jason Greenblatt, his diplomatic ambassador at large, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. The three New Yorkers are ultra-Zionists and stand to the right of Benjamin Netanyahu on the questions of unconditional support for Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. They are actual sponsors of illegal settlements themselves.
{articleGUID}
Imagine if an American president appointed three American-Islamist Hamas sympathisers to run US Israel policy.
Trump's announcement is a violation of international law, to cite French President Emmanuel Macron. The speech in its totality is a declaration of war on Palestinian rights, wrapped in peace rhetoric. It's devoid of any mention of Palestinian plight or US commitment to a two-state solution. Which explains the appearance of the UN Secretary General briefly right after the speech to insist that there's no alternative to two states solution with Jerusalem as capital of both states.
It humiliates the US' Middle Eastern friends and as Palestinian leaders say, disqualifies for good the US' role as broker in any peace process. Its emphasis on historic if not exclusive Jewish rights to Jerusalem and Palestine will further weaken the so-called moderate Arab camp, and embolden US detractors and extremists across the region, especially in Iran.
Even before the speech, Arab and Muslims leaders, including Trump's newfound friends, expressed their concern, criticism and outright condemnation of Washington's decision to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. After the speech, these leaders called for emergency meetings of the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which has 57 members, in the coming days.
If [Arab leaders] don't rise to the occasion and meet the expectations of their bitter and angry citizens, the US will continue to reward Israel for its aggression and Trump's much anticipated 'ultimate deal' will be no more than the ultimate humiliation that pushes the region towards the brink.
So what? Ask the sceptics.
US haters couldn't hate the US any more than they already do, and US allies wouldn't jeopardise their relations with Washington for the Palestinians' sake. The Arab regimes issue statements and declarations for public consumption only. In reality, they are too weak or too divided to do anything about it. The entire Arab order has imploded in recent years under the pressures of civil wars and regional conflicts.
For decades, many of ruling elites of Arab states exploited the cause of Palestine and Israeli desecration of Jerusalem for their own interests. And today, a new generation of leaders is willing to abandon the Palestinians and Jerusalem altogether to enhance their power base with US and, yes, Israeli support. This was best expressed last week in a new Saudi hashtag gone viral: "Riyadh is more important than Jerusalem", as its new rulers began to warm up to Israel under US tutelage.
All of which explains the timing and aggressive temperament of the US position.
{articleGUID}
The US's longest-serving envoy to the peace process, Dennis Ross, has written an entire book, Doomed to Succeed, to reel against Washington obsession with balancing relations between Israel and the Arab world and caring too much for Arab sensitivity. A vocal Zionist, he argued that American leaders didn't learn from the lessons of their predecessors who naively give weight to Arab positions on Israel, when according to Ross, Palestine is not the Arabs' priority.
Regardless of whether his claims are true or otherwise, the current US administration seems to subscribe to Ross's theory. Trump called his Arab allies to inform not consult them about his dangerous decision on Jerusalem.
Despite their plea for a softer and slower approach, Trump decided to kick them where it hurts, while at the same time, express support for their stance against Iran - in return for their compromises on Palestine. However, it's Iran that has come out on top this week, thanks to Trump's Netanyahu emulation.
The so-called moderates may have registered their rejection of the US move, but it remains to be seen in the days and weeks to come whether Arab leaders will do more than hold meetings and issue empty statements.
If they don't rise to the occasion and meet the expectations of their bitter and angry citizens, the US will continue to reward Israel for its aggression and Trump's much anticipated "ultimate deal" will be no more than the ultimate humiliation that pushes the region towards the brink.

Minnesota got this right in many ways
Of all the NHL teams to launch new jerseys this summer, the Minnesota Wild might be the very model by which to judge how this sort of thing should work. A week's worth of build-up, presented by way of a series of unique and varied teaser photos, culminated in a fan event and online reveal for those who couldn't be there in person. And most critically, they produced a design that not only fits well into their existing look but that has been universally praised.
Knowing all this, I was thrilled to get the chance to talk with the Wild's manager of web and creative services, Matt Minnichsoffer. His answers to some of my questions give us a peek behind the curtain at the process of creating the team's newest sweater.
How did it all start?
The first thing I wanted to know — what motivated the redesign of only the road jersey?
Photos from Minnesota Wild
Here's what Matt told me:
Our two home jerseys have a common theme. Both of them are nostalgic, throwback designs. The red home jersey started out as an alternate, then became the permanent home sweater. [When] the alternate green jersey came into existence, [it] was a big hit. Then there was the road jersey, the only remaining link to the original Wild game jerseys. It was cool with the custom number font, but it really did not fit the brand of the Wild anymore, so it was time for a change.
Photos from Minnesota Wild
As an organization we feel established with both of our home sweaters. They have common elements, that make them feel "Minnesota." The roads had just come to the end of their run and we wanted a jersey that was unique, but fit better with the two home sweaters.
The steps the Wild took in 2003 and 2009 with the alternate uniforms Matt mentioned definitely put the organization on a different path with regard to its visual identity. When the team was established in 2000, it had a hip and modern feel. The whole retro trend wasn't quite in vogue yet.
But Minnesota hockey has deep roots and a great heritage. It was only a matter of time before its' NHL uniforms started to reflect that. Today, I think we're at a point where that transformation is complete. But getting here didn't happen overnight.

What's the process of creating a new jersey?
I asked Matt whether the design process was simple and straightforward or long and drawn out. He had quite a lot to say on that subject.
The process takes 18 months with the NHL. First you declare you want to make a change to your team's jersey. Then the NHL has a number of options for the team. They are really involved, and very helpful. In the past we have used outside partners to aid in the design process, but this time we worked directly with the NHL and Reebok. We felt since Reebok constructs the jerseys, they have a handle on the latest and greatest innovations in jersey design. And they did a great job. There is a firm timeline that each team must hit in order for the jersey to make it into production on time. If the organization can't make the decisions necessary to select a jersey in that timeline, you start over. The process begins with a group call to discuss initial design ideas. We had two major prerequisites: 1) the primary Wild logo had to stay, 2) we wanted to maintain the red collar [triangle], consistent with our two other jerseys. From there it was a blank canvas. Reebok came back to us with some great designs. They looked into Minnesota hockey heritage and used that to deliver four unique designs. Then the modification process begins. Once we narrowed in on a design, Reebok moved into prototype mode. These prototypes were then camera tested, both for still photos and TV. If you can't read the numbers from the press box, that's not a strong jersey design. Also, if any colors vibrate, or look undesirable on TV, you have to pull the plug. Once we made it through this step, it was time for focus groups (i.e., the Season Ticket Holders). We had 3-4 opportunities to engage Season Ticket Holders in the development of the new jersey. At each opportunity we'd ask them to give feedback. This is vital to the acceptance of the new jersey. Even though it's a road sweater, it has significant impact on the brand and psyche of the team.
I was also curious whether this design was something they had in mind the whole time or if there were other options that just missed the cut.
We actually had two additional prototypes created by Reebok. They were very close to the actual jersey we ended up going into production with. However, due to fan feedback, camera tests, and logistical issues, they did not make it to the final round. Let's just say that the vintage wheat color was seriously considered. There were four initial designs. Each of the four were pretty different from each other. They were all pretty cool, [but] some felt more "Wild" than others. We narrowed it from there and Reebok came back with a second round that was pretty close to the final product. I think we only had one minor tweak. From there we requested three prototypes for the camera tests and focus groups. [But] I think we'll keep the original designs for "Eyes Only" at Wild HQ.
Well I tried, right? Still, interesting to hear the white jersey almost wasn't white. #WheatHot?

How was the new sweater designed?
We've heard from other teams in the past about who had the most influence over a new design. For the Stars, it was the owner, who wanted a color to "own." For the Sharks, it was about player comfort. So I wanted to know who the driving force was for the Wild.
Obviously, we count on fan feedback as a litmus test on how well the jersey will be accepted and how well it will sell. Home jerseys sell best, but we still wanted a [road] jersey that fans would be proud to wear. Team management and hockey operations also were shown the new designs and their feedback was put into the mix. The first players to see the jersey were Zach Parise and Josh Harding when we did the photo shoot. They both really liked the look.
Photo courtesy of Minnesota WildThe next logical question was, who came up with the design? Reebok or the Wild's own staff? And what was the inspiration? Matt explained:
My internal creative team worked up some designs and sent them to Reebok as a starting point. Then we had a kick-off conference call with the Reebok design team and the NHL. We really only had two or three constraints on the design. No new logos. The primary mark should stay on the front. And we'd like to keep the red collar insert with laces [found] on our other two jerseys. Reebok did some good historical research on Minnesota teams to pull some elements for the initial designs. There were a lot of stripes. Some pretty cool stuff we hadn't thought of internally. But simple is best. "Keep it clean" was the direction we aimed them after the initial concepts.
The words that immediately came to mind when I saw the final design: clean, tasteful and classic. So if I'm any kind of barometer, I'd say they achieved their goal.
The key feature of this jersey that makes it stand out above the club's existing uniforms is the squared-off shoulder yoke. But I was more intrigued by the fact that the Hurricanes just introduced something similar on their new road sweater earlier this summer.
Reebok came up with that on their own. They have created some new collar/shoulder cuts, and this one was pretty unique, so we went with it. The red accent around the collar itself also came from Reebok.
Knew Reebok had to fit in somewhere. Now it's clear. And maybe Reebok has some fresh blood on their design team because this is a neat feature with a nice retro feel. The Stars were also apparently on the receiving end of one of these new "shoulder cuts" with their new road sweater, if you recall.
Any future changes planned?
My last question for Matt was one I've seen a lot from readers in the comments and on Twitter. Are there any plans to change either the home or alternate jersey in the future?
Not that I know of. We now have a grouping of jerseys that fit well together as a family. I think were good for a while.
I think so too. I have to give an enormous thanks to Matt Minnichsoffer for taking the time to answer these questions and to give us a little insight into the process.
If you have any other questions about the jersey, let me know and I may pass them on.
By the way, the reason that last question is being asked has to do with the traditionalist view that home and road jerseys should match — basically, be reversed versions of each other. That was addressed in the team's press release on Sunday.
“It was important for our organization to maintain the primary Wild mark on the new road sweater,” said Vice President of Brand Marketing, John Maher. “We feel the theme of the white jersey fits well into our family of jerseys and wanted this sweater to have a unique look instead of being a reverse of our existing red and green jerseys.”
So they wanted it to be different. Thus, there's no reason for them to alter the home sweater.
New sweater to debut during pre-season
Also in the press release was a debut date. The new white jersey will hit the ice in less than three weeks when the Wild go on the road to play the Jets on Sept. 19 during the pre-season.
Now, I'll leave you with some photos from the Wild's jersey unveiling at the Minnesota State Fair on Sunday morning courtesy of Dean Thibodeau.

The new year is upon us, and it's time to look toward what the next 365 days have in store. As we are wont to do, Linux.com looks at what might well be the best Linux distributions to be found from the ever-expanding crop of possibilities.
Of course, we cannot just create a list of operating systems and say “these are the best,” not when so often Linux can be very task-oriented. To that end, I'm going to list which distros will rise to the top of their respective heaps...according to task.
With that said, let's get to the list!
Best distro for sysadmins : Parrot Linux
parrotsec_a.jpg
Parrot Linux is based on Debian and offers nearly every penetration testing tool you could possibly want. Used with permission
Administrators are tasked with so much on a daily basis. Without a solid toolkit, that job becomes incredibly challenging. For that, there are a host of Linux distributions ready to serve. I believe the one distribution that will find a significant rise in popularity for the coming year will be Parrot Linux. This particular distribution is based on Debian and offers nearly every penetration testing tool you could possibly want. You will also find tools for cryptography, cloud, anonymity, digital forensics, programming, and even productivity. All of these tools (and there are many) are coupled with an already rock-solid foundation to create a Linux distribution perfect for the security and network administrator
Parrot currently stands at #57 on Distrowatch, and I expect to see a significant leap on that list by the end of the year.

Best lightweight distribution: LXLE
lxle_c.jpg
LXLE combines a perfect blend of small footprint with large productivity. Used with permission
Without a doubt, I believe LXLE will become the lightweight distribution of choice in 2017. Why? Simple. LXLE manages to combine a perfect blend of small footprint with large productivity. In other words, this is a small-sized distribution that won't stop you from getting your work done. You'll find all the tools you need in a desktop Linux release that will feel right at home on older hardware (as well as newer machines). LXLE is based on Ubuntu 16.04 (so it will enjoy long-term support) and makes use of the LXDE window manager, which brings with it an instant familiarity.
LXLE ships with many of the standard tools (such as LibreOffice and GIMP). The only caveat is the need to install a more modern (and up-to-date browser).
Currently LXLE stands at #16 on Distrowatch. I look for this to break the top 10 by mid 2017. You can read more about LXLE in this article.
Best desktop distribution: Elementary OS
elementary_os.jpg
Elementary OS Loki is not only beautiful, it is also rock solid and offers unmatched user-friendliness and consistency. Used with permission
I may be biased, but I'm certain that Elementary OS Loki will do the impossible and usurp Linux Mint from the coveted “best desktop distribution” for 2017. That will be a fairly impressive feat, considering that Linux Mint consistently clobbers the competition on Distrowatch. Currently, Elementary OS stands at #6 (where Linux Mint continues its reign at the number one spot). How is it possible that Elementary OS could de-throne Mint? Loki has not only proved itself to be one of the more beautiful Linux distributions, it is also rock solid and offers an unmatched user-friendliness and consistency across the desktop.
Some might find the Elementary OS desktop to be too “Mac-like.” However, that metaphor has proved incredibly effective with end users and, of course, the Elementary take on the design isn't nearly as limiting as is the OS X desktop...so feel free to tweak it to your liking.
I've covered Elementary OS Loki previously, so you can read more in this article.
Best distribution for those with something to prove: Gentoo
gentoo.jpg
Gentoo requires a higher level of Linux understanding, but you will be rewarded with exactly the distribution you want and nothing more. Used with permission
This is a category specific to those who want to show their prowess with the Linux operating system. This is for those who know Linux better than most and want a distribution built specificly to their needs. When this flavor of Linux is desired, there is only one release that comes to mind...Gentoo.
Gentoo is a source-based Linux distribution that starts out as a live instance and requires you to then build everything you need from source. This not only requires a higher level of Linux understanding but also demands more time and patience. In the end, however, you will be rewarded with exactly the distribution you want and nothing more. Gentoo is not new, it's been around for quite some time; but if you want to prove your Linux skills, it helps to start with Gentoo.
Best Linux for IoT: Snappy Ubuntu Core
snappycore.jpg
Ubuntu Snaps makes it incredibly easy to install packages without worrying about dependencies and breakage due to upgrades; this system makes Snappy Core perfect for IoT. Used with permission
Now we're talking really, really small form factor. The Internet of Things category is where embedded Linux truly shines, and there are a number of distributions ready to take on the task. I believe 2017 will be the year of Snappy Ubuntu Core. Ubuntu Snaps have already made it incredibly easy to install packages without worrying about dependencies and breakage due to upgrades. By leveraging this system, Snappy Core makes for a perfect platform for IoT. Ubuntu Snappy Core can already be found in the likes of various hacker boards (such as the Raspberry Pi) as well as Erle-Copter drones, Dell Edge Gateways, Nextcloud Box, and LimeSDR.
Best non-enterprise server distribution: CentOS
centos7.jpg
CentOS is as reliable a server platform as you can find. Used with permission
It should come as no surprise here that CentOS remains the Linux darling of the server room for small- and medium-sized businesses. There's a very good reason CentOS continues to stand at the top of this hill—it's derived from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) sources. Because of this, you know you are getting as reliable a server platform as you can find. The major difference between Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS (besides the branding) is support. With RHEL, you benefit from official Red Hat support. On the contrary, since 2004, CentOS has enjoyed a massive community-driven support system. So, if your small- or medium-sized business is looking to migrate a data center to an open source platform, your first stop is CentOS.
Best enterprise server distribution: RHEL
redhat.jpg
Red Hat is perfectly in tune with enterprise business needs. Used with permission
Once again, there is no surprise here. SUSE is doing a remarkable job of climbing the enterprise ladder and one of these days they will usurp the reigning king of enterprise Linux from the throne. Unfortunately, 2017 will not be that year. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) will continue to top the most wanted list for enterprise businesses. According to Gartner, Red Hat has a 67 percent market share within the realm of Linux (with RHEL subscriptions driving about 75 percent of Red Hat's revenue). The reasons for this are many. Not only is Red Hat perfectly in tune with what enterprise business needs, they also are major contributors to nearly every software stack within the open source community.
Red Hat knows Linux, and they know enterprise. Red Hat is trusted by numerous Fortune 500 companies (such as ING, Sprint, Bayer Business Services, Atos, Amadeus, and Etrade) and RHEL has managed to push many envelopes far and wide in areas of security, integration, cloud, and management. I also look for Red Hat to focus a good amount of energy on IoT in the coming year. Even still, don't be surprised if, by the end of 2017, SUSE further chips away at the current Red Hat market share.
The choice is yours
One of the greatest aspects of the Linux platform is that, in the end, the choice is yours. There are hundreds of distributions to choose from, many of which will perfectly meet your needs. However, if you want to give what I believe will be the best in 2017, take one of the above distributions for a spin; I'm certain you won't be disappointed. Next time, I'll look at which distros are best designed for new users.
Talk to any political organizer and they'll tell you the hardest part about pulling off a successful protest rally is building a big enough crowd for the press to show up and cover the festivities. As tax day approaches, conservatives planning anti-Obama "tea party" demonstrations across the country have found a way around this once-daunting organizer's dilemma: Fox News.
That's right. Despite repeatedly claiming its coverage is "fair and balanced," despite its attacks on anyone who dares claim or imply the cable outlet tilts to the right, despite encouraging viewers to "say 'no' to biased media," Fox News has frequently aired segments imploring its audience to get involved with tea-party protests across the country -- protests the "news" network has described as mainly a response to President Obama's economic policies.
Organizers of these tea-party protests have no bigger cheerleader (or crowd-builder, for that matter) than Fox News, which has provided attendance and organizing information for the events on air and online dozens of times. You name it, they've likely done it. Fox has offered viewers and readers such vital organizing information as protest dates and locations and addresses of websites where people can learn more. It has even posted information and publicity material for the events on its own website. Tea-party planners are now using the planned attendance of Fox News hosts to promote their protests and listing Fox News contributors as "Tea Party Sponsor[s]" on their website.
You see, Fox News hosts Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Neil Cavuto, and Greta Van Susteren are all scheduled to broadcast live from tea parties in different cities across the country, and they've wasted little time in diligently working to boost attendance levels for the April 15 events.
On his Fox program, Hannity has told his viewers, "And don't forget, you can log on to our website to get all the details one week from tomorrow, our special, 'Tax Day Tea Party' show. You can attend. It's live. It's in Atlanta." Cavuto struck the same note, telling his audience, "By the way, this tea party movement that's going against largesse, it is growing. And folks are fed up with out-of-control spending. To that end, we are going to be broadcasting live from one of the biggest of these rallies on April 15, Tax Day. We are at California's state capitol in Sacramento. This is the epicenter of this tax revolt beast, if you will." Buried under the fault line of this "epicenter"? Cavuto's integrity.
For his part, Beck, Fox's conspiracy-theorist-in-chief, managed to escape his "doom room" -- Beck's words -- where he regularly hosts survivalist fringe characters prophesying our impending demise as a nation, long enough to encourage his viewers to come "[c]elebrate with Fox News" at any of four "FNC Tax Day Tea Parties."
It's sounding more and more like a nerdy third-grader begging classmates to show up for his birthday party: "Come on, guys! There's gonna be pizza and a clown -- you've gotta come!"
In all seriousness, it's one thing for a news outlet to cover a political protest -- that's pretty logical. It's quite another for a news outlet to repeatedly encourage its viewers to attend a political protest. Far from practicing legitimate journalism, it's blatantly and unabashedly political.
Beck isn't just helping with turnout. Discussing his participation in the upcoming protest at the Alamo in San Antonio on his syndicated radio program, Beck announced, "I'm going to do a fundraiser for them" to help defray costs. "So you can come and you can have lunch with me. ... I don't know any of the details, but I've heard it's like $500 a plate or something like that." I'm guessing they won't be serving pizza with a price tag clocking in at 500 bones per ticket. The clown, on the other hand? I'm told Beck makes amazing balloon animals.
At this point, Fox News might as well retire its worn-out "we report, you decide" slogan in favor of something more accurate and timely. Perhaps "we incite, then report; rinse and repeat" would do the trick.
Taking all of this into consideration, it's logical for people to be upset over the horrible state of affairs at Fox these days. Some might even be inclined to blame Beck, Hannity, and the rest of their right-wing broadcasting colleagues, but they should resist such temptation. You see, it really isn't their fault at all.
They are simply fulfilling the charge of their boss, Fox News senior vice president Bill Shine, who, in an interview last month with National Public Radio, described the conservative cable network as "the voice of opposition on some issues." Indeed.
At least someone's finally being honest at Fox. Now, if that's not a reason to party, I don't know what is.

At the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA Cars 2017) this week, Samsung's battery division, Samsung SDI, showcases a new “Multifunctional battery pack” solution to enable more range in electric vehicles as the Korean company tries to carve itself a bigger share of the growing automotive battery market.
Most established automakers, like Nissan with the LEAF or even GM with the more recent Chevy Bolt EV, have been using large prismatic cells to build their electric vehicle battery packs.
Tesla pioneered a different approach using thousands of individual smaller cylindrical li-ion battery cells in each pack.
As we previously reported, Tesla's battery strategy is inspiring new electric vehicle startups, but not legacy automakers.
Established automakers haven't made the change yet, but some of those startups have worked with some battery manufacturers, like LG Chem and Samsung SDI, to build new cylindrical cells for automotive solutions.
Tesla's latest battery cell in the Model 3 is a new ‘2170' format built by Panasonic at Tesla's Gigafactory.
Earlier this year, Samsung unveiled its own ‘2170' battery cell to compete with Tesla/Panasonic.
Now they are claiming that they can reach an impressive energy density by using those cells in new modules:
“Multifunctional battery pack” of Samsung SDI attracted the most attention. Its users can change the number of modules as they want as if they place books on a shelf. For example, if 20 modules are installed in a premium car, it can go 600 to 700 kilometers. If 10 to 12 modules are mounted on a regular sedan, it can run up to 300 kilometers. This pack is expected to catch the eyes of automakers, because they can design a car whose mileage may vary depending on how many modules of a single pack are installed.
Unfortunately, they didn't release many specs beyond that.
Pictures from their booth at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA Cars 2017):

The cars were driven by models and taken around some of the luxurious islands off the coast of Miami.

​Secularism: A vague concept created by the Congress, Leftist intellectuals, historians and editors along with Liberals and the civil society where mere lip service is required and nothing more. No concrete practical action is required as it is merely an abstract concept.
Usage: I am secular because I merely call myself secular.
Synonyms: Anti-Hindu, Pro-Muslim.
Antonyms: Modi, RSS, BJP.
Note: Sikhs, Christians etc do not generally form part of the debate.
.
Definitions change from time to time but it makes more sense to associate this adjective with a prime organization or individual. Anyone that even remotely supports that particular organization or individual is communal.Examples of such things…1947-80: RSS.1980-92: BJP.1992-2002: LK Advani.2002-now: Narendra Modi.(Note: Advani is the only example that migrated from communal to secular. He achieved this spectacular feat by strongly opposing Modi. Anyone strongly opposing Modi has to be seen as secular even if he held a Rath Yatra that ended in the Babri Masjid coming down. Basically anyone opposing Modi today is secular and the stronger the opposition, the stronger the secularism.)The capital of communalism in India. It is also the capital of the mainstream media since 2002. (Note: New Delhi was the capital of the MSM from 1947 to 2002.) It is also one of the three landmark years of India.In 1947, India became Independent.In 1991, it got Liberalized.In 2002 it got Communalized.In 2014 it became a Fascist State.(See below)Anything headed by Narendra Modi. Gujarat was declared one in 2002 and India one in 2014.A brilliant novel by George Orwell sahib. It may also have been a year when the grass got flattened when a big tree fell. But nothing more should be said beyond that. In fact, Indian intellectuals are working on Twenty Fourteens.If there is a policy failure or lapse on the part of the government, all the members of the Council of Ministers is jointly responsible in defending that failure/lapse in all forums like TV debates and Twitter and shouting down the Opposition in Parliament and rubbishing even the mildest of criticism elsewhere.Is the one that has sole authority and responsibility for the entire country from top to bottom, from the little to the big and everyone else must either listen or shut up.If you annoy any member of the government in any way through any Tweet, Facebook status message or blog, then you are nothing but a common criminal who must be hunted down. Hell even if you Like such a status or ReTweet it, you are equally responsible.It is the right of every political leader to insult women, rubbish them and pass as many derogatory remarks against them as they can without any fear of reprisal or arrest.A person whose job it is to speak and keep on speaking making sure not to listen to anything at all and to make sure that nobody else speaks.A totally fictitious concept in India. There are only TV opinion channels. New has been broken to such fine ground dust that only opinions remain.A person who has the right to liberally attack and bully any person or party who does not agree with his or her point of view.Something that is full of more than a hundred people chargesheeted for various offences from harmless things like protest marches to the more serious ones like rape and murder. There is a lot of shouting and screaming along with walk outs all the time and even a great deal of bunking.It is also a dangerous place and sometimes pepper spray may be required. But it is a true mirror of India.A concept that is the very soul of India and has to be accepted because it is valid by divine right. Anything opposing it in any form is anti-democratic anti-progressive and communal. It formed the backbone of the MSM from 2004-14 when they had two slogans: “She Who Must Not Be Named” and “She Must Not Be Unhappy”.A dodgy concept that makes no sense when religion, caste and crime are more useful to gather votes. Anyone who uses this to win elections is obviously a Fascist dictator.An annual festival where all the merry participants joke, dance, party, do ads, make loads of money, travel all over India and generally have a good time. There are dancing girls, Bollywood superstars and VVIPs all around. Sometimes the bookies and the underworld also get into the act.And they also play some cricket in between.
Image caption It is highly unlikely Bieber would be given permission to enter North Korea
Canadian singer Justin Bieber's has become the target of a viral campaign to send him to North Korea.
A website polled users as to which country he should tour next, with no restrictions on the nations that could be voted on.
There are now almost half a million votes to send the singer to the secretive communist nation.
The contest, which ends at 0600 on 7 July, saw North Korea move from 24th to 1st place in less than two days.
Many of the votes are thought to originate from imageboard website 4chan, which has built a reputation for triggering online viral campaigns.
The voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label.
Given the fact that almost all citizens of North Korea are denied internet access and there are restrictive controls over all media, it is unlikely that any of the votes have actually come from within the country.
A spokesman for the North Korean Embassy in London told BBC News that any application for 16-year-old Bieber to tour would be dealt with by its mission to the United Nations, although the matter would be referred to Pyongyang.
Hate campaign
Justin Bieber has been target of a number of internet pranks in recent weeks.
Last month, a post on 4chan urged users to all search for the term "Justin Bieber Syphilis" pushing it to the top of Google Trend's Hot Searches list.
Image caption It is not known if Kim Jong-il is a fan of Justin Bieber's music
And over the weekend, Justin Bieber videos on YouTube were the target for internet hackers, redirecting users to adult websites or triggering pop-up messages saying that the Canadian singer had died in a car crash.
Google temporarily suspended commenting on videos and issued a statement saying: "We took swift action to fix a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability." The vulnerability hole was patched a few hours later.
His Last FM page was also hit, with photos of the singer replaced by pornographic images.
There have also been false rumours circulating that Bieber had died, that he had joined a cult, and that his mother was offered $50,000 to pose topless in Playboy magazine.
"Let's take some time to answer some crazy (rumours)... I'm not dead," Bieber wrote in just one of his Twitter postings.
And last week he posted that "My mum is a moral woman... let's just leave that one for what it is... because that rumour just grossed and weirded me out."
Correction 7 July 2010: This story has been amended since it was first published to make it clear that the voting site is not endorsed by Mr Bieber's record label Universal Music.

Jordon Cox claims he saved cash via unorthodox route – but admits it's not an environmentally friendly journey
Blogger says flying via Berlin was cheaper than Sheffield to Essex train
A teenage blogger claims he saved £7.72 on his train journey from Sheffield to Essex – by taking a plane via Berlin.
Jordon Cox, 18, who blogs as the Coupon Kid for MoneySavingExpert.com, wrote on the website that he travelled an extra 1,017 miles last week and saved £7.72 by getting back to Essex from Sheffield via Berlin.

He wrote: “I know that flying is not very environmentally friendly and I won't do this every time I travel, however this was the cheapest way for me to get home and I got to enjoy a ‘free' mini holiday to a city I've always wanted to visit.”
Cox said he booked a cheap train fare to Sheffield but found a return ticket was £47.
He found that flying from East Midlands airport to Berlin, spending seven hours exploring the city and then flying to London Stansted and getting a bus home was cheaper than a single train journey in England.
He also discovered he could buy a return train ticket to Berlin city centre, enjoy a free tour of a government building and eat lunch there and still save money.
He wrote: “OK, this isn't for everyone as it can take a whole day to get to your final destination, but if you're not in a rush, your focus is saving money and you fancy a little walk around a European city, it's worth a look.”
He reminded anyone considering his methods to factor in travel to and from airports to ensure an overall saving – and remember their passport.
Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer, a Breitbart News editor and head of the Government Accountability Institute, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Friday's Breitbart News Daily to discuss the election and what Marlow described as the defeat of “the most powerful family, relative to their corruption” in modern American history, the Clintons.
Schweizer pointed to a few key strategies that helped Donald Trump overcome the powerful political and media forces arrayed against him.
“Number one, he articulated an outsider message about Washington, D.C., but Number two, he really did make this a referendum on the Clintons, and also frankly on Washington, D.C. I mean, the Clintons are kind of the alphas of corruption, creating a political machine, running that machine with peak efficiency, dominating our politics, excluding ordinary Americans from how they operate,” said Schweizer.
“But they're not the only ones that do that,” he continued. “And, of course, you have to remember, in a way, Donald Trump defeated two dynasties: the Bush dynasty in the primary, and the Clinton dynasty now. That is an amazing feat. I think it speaks to the attitude of the country that while there was this sort of veneer in the mainstream media of, oh, people kind of like dynasties, like the Kennedys and Camelot. That really wasn't the reality. People didn't like this notion of entitlements, and now it's Hillary's turn, or now it's Jeb's turn. They wanted something fundamentally different.”
“And you know, Trump did it his way. He did it with a style that was very aggressive – that I think, fairly sometimes, he got criticized for going too strong. But on the other hand, I think the previous sort of gentlemanly approach, where we're going to softly talk about corruption or we're going to softly talk about cronyism, doesn't work in this media age,” Schweizer argued.
He made the interesting point that Trump's most important speech, although not the most colorful or most widely covered by the mainstream media, was the one he delivered in Gettysburg, where he called for “draining the swamp” of government corruption.
“Lifetime bans on lobbying, we're gonna push term limits – I view that, in a way, as the most important speech because I think all the other things that he talked about: the trade deals, lousy trade deals, or an immigration policy that is totally distorted and doesn't reflect the interests of the American people, the tax code, all of those are key problems. But in my mind, they are symptoms of the larger problem, which are we have a political class in Washington that those policies are the result of this self-enrichment. We don't get those policies by random. We get them because we have a corrupted system, and people benefit from lousy trade deals. They get paid for putting together lousy trade deals,” Schweizer said.
“To me, the battle against the permanent political class, I think, is the core of what Trump needs to accomplish, and he knows we're seeing right now – I mean, look, as going back to the Reagan years. You know, Reagan's people had a statement: policy is personnel. We're gonna know a lot of the tenor and tone of his approach on these issues based on the people that get appointed to Cabinet positions and White House positions. There is, no doubt, a huge effort being made right now by the political class to co-opt Trump and say, ‘Oh yeah, we know you said that, but here, this is how we really need to handle it,” he predicted.
Schweizer recommended keeping an eye on some key senior positions in the Trump White House as well as the people Trump appoints to head agencies like the Department of Education. “Are you, in a sense, filling those slots – I understand you need to have people with experience, we all recognize that – but are you basically slotting those positions with the wrong type of experience or with people that really haven't been true believers in ‘drain the swamp'”? he asked.
“Remember, even a guy like Donald Trump with his strong personality, the guy that can sort of bend the hotel industry to his will, as he's done in the past – you're fighting a monolith, a very powerful monolith in Washington, D.C. You need to have reinforcements, and you need to know that when you tell the White House senior staff, ‘I want to do this,' that they're not going to slowly drift off in a another direction that the Washington establishment wants more,” he advised.
Schweizer credited Trump's election victory to “strong support from all sorts of different demographic groups,” an uprising from people who see the D.C. political class as hopelessly obsessed with matters irrelevant to their daily lives, and widespread over-estimation of the Clinton political machine's power. He included himself and other conservatives in the latter category error.
“You had high turnouts in lots of areas, but you also had a big drop-off in turnout in places like Detroit and Milwaukee,” he observed. “That is a reflection of how even traditional Democratic voters basically rejected Hillary Clinton.”
He noted that Clinton's vaunted billion-dollar Get Out the Vote machine was on the ground throughout the election, but there just weren't enough people “interested in pulling the lever for Hillary Clinton” – which “does offer hope that even people that have voted for the Democratic Party for decades, and perhaps have a financial interest themselves in public assistance and other things in voting for a democrat, even they could not be motivated enough to go and pull the lever for Hillary.”
In contrast, he said, “Even the staunchest critics of Donald Trump have to admit that his was a grassroots campaign.”
“This was not a campaign that was based on a political machine, Get Out the Vote efforts, trying to corrupt the ballot booth. This was a genuine grassroots effort. People came out and voted because they'd had enough. They believed in Trump. They wanted to, in a sense, give the middle finger to the Washington establishment. For the Left, there are a lot of resources, a lot of money that was thrown into these Get Out the Vote efforts, some of the dirty politics that Project Veritas and James O'Keefe exposed, and they didn't make it,” Schweizer observed.
He spoke out against those political dirty tricks, declaring that “every time somebody is allowed to vote twice or vote three times, it really does cancel out a legitimate vote from someone else.”
Marlow asked Schweizer for his take on the Clinton scandals going forward, guessing that her email server scandal would probably “go away,” but speculating that at least four other corruption investigations of Clintonworld would go forward, particularly the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play abuses chronicled so extensively in Clinton Cash.
Schweizer agreed that the Clinton Foundation probe would, and should, continue.
“I've said this from the beginning, Alex. I've talked about this multiple times. I think it should, and I think the main reason is that it's not ultimately about the Clintons. It's about the Clintons' model,” he contended. “They've created this model for self-enrichment by taking foreign money. They set up this foundation. The spouse hits the lecture circuit. Look, in Washington, D.C., you figure out a way to get rich and get away with it through public service, everybody's gonna start doing it.”
“So this goes beyond the Clintons. We are going to see a Secretary of Defense in the future, Republican or Democrat, do the same thing, if this is not thoroughly investigated and vetted,” he warned.
Schweizer added that the Clinton Foundation scandal was also about the rule of law: “I mean, if we have a senior government official who engaged in corrupt practices, which I believe they did, it should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI, and if crimes were committed, they ought to face the consequences – as would a mid-level bureaucrat in government, as would a businessman or a blue-collar worker.”
He anticipated much would come down to how the investigation of the Clinton Foundation was conducted.
“People are saying Trump is going to investigate the Clintons. Donald Trump's not going to investigate the Clintons. The FBI is,” Schweizer noted. “The point is – and I think this is the way we ought to view all cases – you look at the evidence. The Clintons are certainly going to paint the picture that this is a partisan witch hunt. They've always attacked the messenger. That is always their strategy. They did it to me. They've done it to other people who have written critically about it. They're going to do it here.”
“But I do believe if there is – and I think there is – very compelling evidence that the Clintons engaged in pay-to-play, I think you put it out there, and you prosecute. The American people will evaluate this, and come to the right conclusion, if indeed that evidence is there. I've always said I'm not a lawyer, but I think if you give the FBI the tools, the subpoenas, the things they need to investigate what they do, and if they come back and say, ‘Look, we think there was shady stuff going on, but we don't think that in a court of law we can get a conviction,' that's fine. Everybody can say there was an investigation done, the professionals looked into it, we move on,” he said.
“But I think to just say, ‘Well, she gets a free pass because she lost,' here's the problem with that: If she had won, she was gonna get a free pass because there's no way the FBI was going to investigate the sitting President of the United States and do so fairly. And now people are saying she's lost and she should get a free pass. You're saying they get a free pass regardless of what happens,” Schweizer pointed out.
He said the Clintons were motivated by their hunger for power and money, but added, “I think deeply embedded in that is this sense of entitlement, that they are owed this. They are owed the money. They are owed the power.”
Furthermore, Schweizer cited David Maraniss' biography of Bill Clinton from several years ago, First in His Class, which was “generally sympathetic,” but included testimony from Clinton's childhood friends about how he enjoyed breaking the rules and getting away with it, like the proverbial theft of cookies from the cookie jar.
“This friend observed to Maraniss that for Bill, it really wasn't about the cookie. It wasn't about the ultimate payoff of the cookie. His motivation was really just thinking that he could get away with it, that he was smart enough to steal cookies from the cookie jar at home, and his mom not knowing about it,” Schweizer said. “That was the big payoff and thrill for Bill. So I think there is also just this sense of, no other president has done this before. Perhaps their hope is no other president will do it after. And this just proves how smart and brilliant they are, that they can get away with stuff that other people can't.”
He took a moment to salute Breitbart News for its influence on the election, and its ability to resist mainstream media efforts to bury the Clinton scandals.
“It's been an amazing election year, and I think Breitbart has been front and center. And to think about, with all the major media outlets, with large major budgets, with larger resources than Breitbart, that Breitbart was at the center of this national debate – it is really a testament to our readers, but also to the leadership that you provided, and the great work that so many reporters on the Breitbart staff have done. Bravo!” Schweizer told Marlow.
He concluded with a confession about his perspective on the 2016 race: “I really thought it was hers to lose.”
“I think primarily because you saw this major shift in major news outlets, where it became a parallel universe,” he explained. “When Clinton Cash came out last year, pretty much all the major news outlets do stories, positive stories about the book, supportive of our findings – that completely changed over the summer. It really became a sort of mantra started by the Clintons that, ‘Well, this is all discredited.' That became the phraseology on CNN, on MSNBC, and by the Clinton team. And by looking at the Podesta emails – and, of course, Breitbart's done a great job of reporting this – you see how successful they are in collaborating with the media.”
“I guess it's probably partly my age. I'm 51. I thought, well, you've got this big media outlet that just seems to kind of chug along and do their bidding for them,” he reflected. “I think I put too much faith in that, and I guess I did not put enough faith in the ability of the American people to seek out other sources of information and to basically say, ‘Enough is enough.'”
“So I was surprised, as a lot of people were,” he admitted. “Very happy. I think dynasties, whether Republican or Democrat, are not great for our country. And I really do think the bread-and-butter issue is corruption and cronyism. The reason we get bad trade deals, the reason we get bad tax policy, the reason we get crony deals is because of the political class. My hope is that that is where President-elect Trump focuses his attention.”

LISTEN:
Boston College football coach Steve Addazio has led the Eagles to two straight seven-win seasons and two bowl appearances since taking over for Frank Spaziani.
When it comes to big-time football, Boston College has gone deep in paying its head coach. Steve Addazio, the highest paid employee in BC history, last year ranked among the most generously compensated football coaches in the ACC at nearly $2.6 million.
Addazio and Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer, who also earned about $2.6 million, trailed only three other ACC coaches in total compensation: Florida State's Jimbo Fisher ($3.6 million), Clemson's Dabo Swinney ($3.2 million), and Louisville's Bobby Petrino ($3 million), according to BC's most recent federal tax filing and the USA Today database on coaching salaries.
Addazio's compensation is not listed by USA Today because BC, as a private school, is not obligated to make his salary public. But as a non-profit institution, BC is required to list its highest-paid employees to the federal government in its annual tax filing.

BC's filing for the tax year ending May 31, 2014, recently became available. The school's student newspaper, The Heights, appears to have first reported Addazio's salary.

Addazio assumed control of the Eagles in 2013, after they went 2-10 the previous year under Frank Spaziani, who earned about $1 million. Addazio has since guided BC to consecutive seven-win seasons and two bowl appearances.
Former BC basketball coach Steve Donahue was the school's second highest-paid employee last year at $1 million. Donahue was replaced after the 2013-14 season by Jim Christian and took over in March as Penn's head coach. Christian's salary will not be available until BC's next tax filing.
BC's other highly paid sports employees last year were athletic director Brad Bates at $695,000 and men's hockey coach Jerry York at $627,000.
BC also continued to pay former basketball coach Al Skinner, who was fired in 2010. Skinner received $585,000 from the school last year, while he served as an assistant coach at Bryant University.

Skinner, who last month became the head coach at Kennesaw State, also received a mortgage loan of $650,000 from BC, according to the school's most recent filing.
Others in the athletic department who received loans for mortgages were Donahue ($600,000), Addazio ($500,000), Bates ($500,000), and York ($150,000).
BC also reported that it paid country club memberships for four highly paid employees as part of their reported compensation, but the school did not identify those individuals.
A school spokesman said he could not immediately provide additional information.

Bengaluru: This crime surely would give any Bollywood murder mystery a run for its money. Love, spirituality, sex, bomb threat, and terrorism – everything was a part of Bengaluru techie MG Gokul's well-laid plot to kill his wife, win over his married girlfriend and later cover his footprints. However, as with all such stories, the 37-year-old engineer finally ran out of luck, and is cooling his heels in jail now.
It all began with the police arresting Gokul on Saturday for sending threat messages to the Kempe Gowda International Airport via WhatsApp. It had resulted in flights being diverted and delays in a few flights taking off.
Initially, the police viewed Gokul, who had used a SIM registered in the name of his neighbour Saju Jose to send the threat messages, as a prankster. But as they continued to interrogate him, they made a stunning discovery, something that would have been ignored had the techie not sent the threat messages.
Here's exactly what happened, according to the Bengaluru police – Gokul was madly in love with a Christian girl, who studied engineering with him in Thrissur, Kerala, till 2007. Though he wanted to marry her, it did not materialise. Later, he moved to New Delhi and fell in love with a common friend Anuradha, who was very spiritual. He tied the knot with her in 2009 and they had a baby girl. He lost touch with the girl, who married Saju Jose, and settled down in Bengaluru.
Within a few years of marriage, Gokul developed differences with Anuradha because of his odd working hours. Anuradha allegedly had an extramarital affair and Gokul discovered it after he checked her phone. A distraught Gokul was seeking ways to tackle it and by chance, he found his original love (the girl from college) on Facebook in 2011 and got in touch with her. He made several trips to Bengaluru and was disappointed to learn that she too was married and was a mother. However, he continued to maintain contact with her and when he learnt over a period of time that her married life too was in trouble, Gokul hatched a grand plan.
He quickly informed his father-in-law (a retired senior cop) about Anuradha's alleged affair. Then, he created an email ID (Baba), aware of the fact that his wife was an ardent devotee of Sai Baba. He started sending emails using the ‘Baba' ID to his wife and she fell for the trap. Over a period of two months, she confided over email to ‘Baba' that she was having an extramarital affair.
The ‘Baba' ‘advised' Anuradha to confess to her husband and lead a normal life. Accordingly, Anuradha confessed to her husband and Gokul forgave her. However, within months, Anuradha resumed her affair and Gokul was upset. This time, he decided to eliminate her and woo his original love.
Gokul created another fictitious email ID – ASHA (Astrology, Spirituality, Humility, Attention) and connected with Anuradha, who once again fell into the trap. Gokul, posing as ASHA (spiritual counselor), advised Anuradha that there was nothing wrong in the affair and that he would help her in rendering her husband a silent spectator. Using the fake ID (ASHA), Gokul advised Anuradha to pose in the nude with her paramour and send him the pictures so that he could offer special prayers to keep Gokul at bay. Anuradha allegedly sent her nude pictures posing with her paramour. Gokul downloaded the pictures as evidence of his wife's extramarital affairs. He showed those pictures to his father-in-law, who now was completely on Gokul's side.
Under the pretext of ending the affair, Gokul relocated to Bengaluru with his wife in January 2014 and took an apartment on rent in the same complex where his classmate lived with her husband. In June, using ASHA email ID, Gokul sent a set of instructions (including one to consume a lot of alcohol) to Anuradha to perform special prayers so that she is reunited with her paramour.
On 27 June this year, Anuradha allegedly got drunk and she passed out. Taking advantage of the situation, Gokul allegedly hit her several times on her forehead using an idol of Lord Ganesha and killed her. Later, he called the police and his father-in-law and informed them that she died accidently. Though the police strongly suspected foul play and wanted to interrogate Gokul, his father-in-law intervened and saved him. Gokul's father-in-law, who had seen all the evidence of his daughter's extra-marital affair, never suspected Gokul's involvement.
Simultaneously, Gokul was trying to create a rift between his former classmate and her husband. Gokul shot off a letter in the name of the Bengaluru Archbishop to Saju Jose claiming that his wife was not happy with him and wanted to divorce him. He also wrote another letter to the woman posing as the Archbishop and advised her to abandon Saju Jose. In the meantime, he allegedly committed the murder and left for Anuradha's hometown for her funeral and returned to Bengaluru in July.
After finding out that Saju Jose and his former classmate had patched up, he became angry and decided to end the matter. He bought a SIM card under a fake name (Salman) and sent a message to Saju Jose threatening him. Later, he bought another SIM card in the name of Saju Jose (by accessing identity documents). As Gokul worked with an internet service provider, it was easy for him to process the mobile phone subscription applications, according to the police. His primary aim was to depict that Saju Jose was in league with terrorists like the fictitious Salman so that his wife abandoned him.
On Saturday, he sent messages to the Kempe Gowda International Airport manager claiming to have planted bombs in three flights. The police, who were alerted, traced the mobile phone number subscriber and landed at Saju Jose's home. But when they found out that he did not have the smartphone and the signals originated from a different apartment in the same complex, they found the phone in the possession of Gokul.
It took one full day for the police to unravel the mystery. According to Bengaluru City Police Commissioner NS Megharik, Gokul hatched the plot to ensure that Saju Jose was behind the bars so that he could marry his former classmate. Additional Commissioner of Police (East) P Harisekaran confirmed that Gokul had confessed to having killed his wife and laid out the elaborate plan to trap his former classmate's husband.
Gokul, according to the police, is trying to derail the probe by claiming that the woman he was pursuing had cooperated with him in trying to portray Saju Jose as a “terrorist”.

Cast of the new ABC/Marvel series ‘The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'Photo Credit: ABC
Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will be taking one more week off before returning for the last few episodes of the season. When the show does return on April 1st Marvel promises an uprising; an event that will shake the very core of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team. One can only assume that this will have something to do with the arrival of Deathlok. Now, Marvel has released five new images of actor J. August Richards as Deathlok.
The images are from the upcoming episode of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. entitled “End of the Beginning.”
As you know, after the tragic accident Mike Peterson suffered, he was “recruited” back into the organization, which “repaired” his injuries by installing new technology in him. One of the things they upgraded in him was the same technology they implanted in Akela Amador earlier in the season.
Before we take a look at the images, let's take a look at the synopsis for the episode so that we know where things stand heading into the episode.
Agents Garrett and Triplett are back to help Coulson's team track down S.H.I.E.L.D.'S nefarious enemy – the Clairvoyant. But will Deathlok destroy them all to protect his master's identity?”
Could Mike Peterson have gained such a respect for his “master” in the short amount of time he has been with them? Could this overtake his loyalty to the people who saved him from his original fate and the people who helped him save his son? I guess we'll have to watch and find out.
Here is a look at the latest images of Deathlok from the upcoming episode of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. returns on Tuesday, April 1st at 8:00 p.m. on ABC.
Editor's Note: We had such a great response to our Primer on Krav Maga article back in July, we thought many of you would be interested in learning more about this devastatingly effective martial art. To that end, each month we'll publish a different krav maga technique explained by krav maga expert and author, David Kahn. Many of the techniques that David will share with us are featured in his latest book, Krav Maga Weapon Defenses.
The Israeli krav maga self-defense system has achieved global recognition for its efficiency, simplicity, and, when required, brutal efficiency. Krav maga's world-renowned defense moves against weapons were developed for a modern army. Over the next few months, we'll take a look at ways to defend against various attacks using impact weapons.
Impact weapon attacks can come in many forms — baton, hammer, crowbar, or any number of weapon-like objects. Impact weapons (along with edged weapons) are often referred to in krav maga parlance as “cold weapons.” Attacks can come from a myriad of directions, heights, and angles in single-swing attacks. The three fundamental principles of defense are either (1) to close the distance between you and the assailant while deflecting-redirecting the attack, (2) to disengage until you recognize the correct timing to then close the distance, or (3) to retreat straight away.
Close the distance. The end of the weapon generates the most force, as the assailant's wrist is used as a fulcrum. Therefore, the most dangerous range of the attack is to be struck with the very end of the weapon. In other words, the object's momentum decreases the closer you come to the assailant's swinging wrist. That's why it's vital to close the distance between you and your attacker as quickly as possible. Optimally, the distance between the defender and the assailant can be closed before a weapon is deployed while debilitating the adversary with strong combatives, blocking access to the weapon, and achieving dominant control. If the weapon is successfully deployed and put into action, closing the distance will allow the defender to either deflect-redirect or block the weapon, the majority of the time in combination with body defenses, while delivering withering counterattacks. As with all krav maga defenses, the hand always leads the body to deflect-redirect in conjunction with simultaneous multiple counterattacks.
Time correctly. Another essential to a successful defense is precise timing; closing the distance and using the correct tactic at the correct time. Fight timing is best thought of as the fusion of instinct with simultaneous decision making to either pre-empt the attack, move off the line of attack/fire, deflect-redirect, control the weapon and strike, or retreat from harm's way. In other words, fight timing is harnessing instinctive body movements while seizing or creating opportunities to defend both efficiently and intelligently. Defined yet another way, fight timing is your ability to capitalize on a window of opportunity offered by your opponent or to create your own opportunity to end the confrontation using whatever tactics come instinctively to you. In short, you'll attack the attacker. Importantly, the tactics and techniques are designed to provide the defender with a pre-emption capability prior to a weapon being deployed. The goal is not to allow an assailant to get the drop on you. Your recognition of his intent and body language literally and figuratively will allow you to cut the legs out from under him.
Retreat straight away. As soon as you see that the threat has been neutralized, retreat as soon as possible to avoid future attacks.
Below, we take a look at how to defend against a common impact weapon attack: the overhand one-handed strike with a blunt object like a bat or crowbar.
Listen to my podcast with David Kahn:
Overhand Direct One-Handed Strike Defense
One of the most typical attacks with a blunt object is an overhead swing. In this technique we assume the assailant is using his right hand and the defender is squared up or face-to-face. You will execute the defense with your sameside (left) arm and counterpunches with your right arm while controlling the weapon with your left.
Your goal is to close the distance to intercept and deflect-redirect the impact weapon harmlessly over your shoulder while delivering a simultaneous punch to the throat, jaw, or nose, trapping the weapon arm to remove it from the assailant's grip while delivering more retzev (continuous motion) combatives. One way to practice the deflecting-stabbing movement of the defense is to simulate diving into a pool with your arms in a “V” motion to pierce the water while keeping your legs straight. Keep the fingers together and simply touch both of your hands together at the fingertips, resembling the inverted “V.” Do not touch your palms together, only your fingertips. Now, drop one arm into a straight punch position. Continue building this defense by aligning your deflecting-redirecting hand with a forward body lean, burying your chin into your shoulder.
Once you feel comfortable with the initial defense, add a simultaneous punch with your other arm, thrusting both arms out together. I recommend a palm down punch or keeping the palm of the hand parallel to the ground, targeting the nose, chin, or throat.
Next time we take a look defending a two-handed overhead attack with chair or stool. Until then, train hard and always remember retzev.

Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence spoke out against Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump supporters as in 'the basket of deplorables.' "They are not a basket of anything," Pence said on Sept. 10. "They are Americans and they deserve your respect." (FRC Action)
It was supposed to be a layup: Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence condemning Hillary Clinton's "basket of deplorables" remarks, while addressing a friendly audience of social conservatives. Instead, done in by either incomplete notes or the awkwardness of Clinton's phrase, Pence spent about two minutes of his speech to the Values Voter Summit struggling to craft the right response.
"Hillary Clinton, in remarks that were made in New York City just last night, bear repeating," said Pence, rifling through a sheaf of notes. "And … let me see where someone put them here."
[Did Hillary Clinton just make her own '47 percent' gaffe?]
As the audience of hundreds laughed gently in support, Pence made a joke at his own expense: "Take your time." Then he looked up and appeared to proceed without the quote in hand.
"Hillary Clinton said last night, at a big fundraiser in New York City, that, uh, the American people, the millions of Americans that are supporting my running mate, were described in the most deplorable of terms. It's extraordinary to think of it. She referred to those people as irredeemable."
Pence paused for effect, tucking his tongue inside his cheek. "Well, I will tell you right now — I campaign on a regular basis with Donald Trump," he said. "I campaign all across this country for Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton's low opinion of the people that support this campaign should be denounced in the strongest possible. The truth of the matter is that the men and women who support Donald Trump's campaign are hard-working Americans. Farmers. Coal miners. Teachers. Veterans. Members of our law enforcement community. Members of every class of this country who know that we can make America great again. So let me just say, from the bottom of my heart — they are not a basket of anything. They are Americans and they deserve your respect."
That, finally, drew applause and hoots of recognition, but it wasn't clear how many people in the audience could tell what Pence was referring to. In the lengthy Clinton quote, the Democrat — telling donors that she was making a "gross generalization" -- said that "half" of Trump's supporters amounted to "a basket of deplorables," evil and racist forces that were "irredeemable." After the quote blew up, Clinton's campaign insisted that the reference to "supporters" was not a reference to half of Trump's voters.
"To just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the 'basket of deplorables,'" Hillary Clinton said at a New York fundraiser on Sept. 9. "The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that, and he has lifted them up." (Video: The Washington Post / Photo: AP)
But in the first real test of how the quote could be weaponized, Pence came up with a fistful of nothing. After the applause for his "respect" line, he steered himself to safer shores, referring to a 2008 moment when then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama told donors that some voters would oppose him because harsh economic realities made them "bitter."
"I've not heard that level of disdain for Americans, that I can't even repeat, since Barack Obama described people that oppose him as people that cling to their guns and religion," Pence said. "Let me just say, no one with her record of failure at home and abroad, no with her avalanche of dishonesty and corruption, and no one with that low opinion of the American people should ever be elected president."
Concert poster
The Moondog Coronation Ball was a concert held at the Cleveland Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, on March 21, 1952. It is generally accepted as the first major rock and roll concert.
Background [ edit ]
Alan Freed had joined WJW-Radio in 1951 as the host of a classical-music program, but he took up a different kind of music at the suggestion of Cleveland record-store owner Leo Mintz, who had noted with great interest the growing popularity, among young customers of all races, of rhythm-and-blues records by black musicians.[1] Mintz decided to sponsor Freed's three hours of late-night programming. Once they saw the popularity of the program increase, they decided on holding a live dance event featuring some of the artists whose records were appearing on Freed's show.[1]
Concert [ edit ]
The concert was organized by Freed (a disc jockey and considered to have popularized the term "Rock and Roll" at WJW-Radio), along with Lew Platt, a local concert promoter, and Freed's sponsors, including Mintz, owner of the Record Rendezvous store. The concert featured Tiny Grimes, Paul Williams and the Hucklebuckers, and the Rocking Highlanders (an African American instrumental group that appeared in kilts). Also on the bill were the Dominoes, Varetta Dillard and Danny Cobb.[2]
The concert was held on March 21, 1952.[1] More tickets were printed than the arena's actual capacity, in part due to counterfeiting and a printing error.[3][4] With an estimated 20,000 individuals trying to crowd into an arena that held slightly more than half that — and worries that a riot might break out as people tried to crowd in — the fire authorities shut down the concert after the first song by opening act Paul "Hucklebuck" Williams ended.[5] Freed made a public apology on WJW the next day.[6]
Contemporary revival [ edit ]
Cleveland rock radio station WMMS (100.7 FM) attempted to stage a revival of the concert in 1986 under the name "Moondog Coronation Ball II"; then-program director John Gorman had intended for the event to serve as an oldies rock and roll tribute concert – part of the campaign to bring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to Cleveland. For legal reasons, the event never materialized. A few years later in 1992, Gorman, then at local oldies radio station WMJI (105.7 FM), successfully organized a 40th anniversary concert called "Moondog Coronation Ball '92". The concert has been held every year since, featuring oldies rock and roll acts, and sponsored by WMJI. In recent years, the event has been held at Quicken Loans Arena.[7][8]

On the 12th October 1917 the W.M. Barkley, sailing from Dublin to Liverpool with a cargo full of Guinness, was torpedoed by a German U-boat. The ship broke in two and sank taking with her five men including the captain.
The Guinness Brewery has had a thriving export trade ever since it first started brewing their world renowned stout at St. James Gate, Dublin in 1759. They would send barrels by barge and boat via the canals to serve all parts of the Ireland and from the River Liffey out across the Irish sea to England from where it was then exported around the globe. Up until the early 20th century they relied on shipping companies to deliver their popular stout but a strike at Dublin Port in 1913 prompted them to buy the first vessel in their very own fleet – the W.M Barkley.
Purchased 1st December 1913, she was a former merchant steamer built in 1898 by Ailsa Shipbuilding Company in Troon, Scotland. The W.M Barkely was the first of nine Guinness boats – eight more ships purchased between 1913 – 1977, the last being The Miranda Guinness which ceased operations in April 1993.
The W.M Barkley's story is a brief but eventful one. She had only been in service a year when in 1914 at the outbreak of World War 1 was requisitioned into service by the British Admiralty along with several other Guinness ships. She was initially assigned to transport material for road building in France. However, she proved to be too fuel inefficient, needing to stop for coal often and so was returned to the Guinness company in 1917. Though she wasn't back long before wartime tragedy struck.
On the 12th October 1917 the Barkley set sail from Dublin to Liverpool with a cargo of barrels full of the black stuff and a crew of 13 men. Without warning, 7 miles east of the Kish Lightship, the ship was torpedoed by the German submarine UC-75. Within minutes the ship broke in two and sank. She took with her five men including the captain. The rest of the crew huddled for safety on board the open lifeboat, left to face the harsh sea in darkness but were eventually rescued.
One of the surviving crew members was later interviewed about that night. Thomas McGlue, the ship's cook/steward, was in the galley making a cup of tea when the torpedo struck. He made his way in darkness up to the deck and managed to get onto the lifeboat. He recalled the night saying “the Barkley was doing her best to go down but the barrels were fighting their way up through the hatches and that kept us afloat a bit longer, in fact, it's the reason any of us got out of there.”
Thomas and the other survivors made it aboard the lifeboat and rowed away far enough away from the Barkley so not to get dragged down. All the while the Germans were observing them through binoculars from the conning tower of their submarine. The men hailed the captain requesting to pick them up. He called them alongside and asked the name of the ship and cargo they carried. When he was satisfied the crew were not enemy combatants, the captain told them they were free to go and pointed the direction they should row for.
The survivors attempted to row towards the Kish Lightship but gave up because “it might have been America for all the way we made. We got tired and my hand was hurting. We put out the sea anchor and sat there shouting all night.” said McGlue They were eventually rescued by a passing ship Donnet Head and were taken back to Dublin port the next morning. They were promptly given a brandy, dry clothes and a warm fire by the Guinness superintendent.
The W.M Barkley now lies on the ocean floor some 26km east of Howth Head in 56 m of water.
In 2011 the INFOMAR Programme surveyed the wreck and took high-resolution images of the ship. The detailed image above shows the ship on the seabed and you can clearly see where the ship broke in two.
The gun manufacturer responsible for producing the military-style assault weapon used by a shooter to kill 20 first-graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School has moved a lawsuit filed against the company from state to federal court, where it could have less chance of succeeding.
RELATED: Sandy Hook families sue gun manufacturer of military-style assault weapon
Ten families that were affected by the mass shooting on Dec. 14, 2012, filed a lawsuit this past December against Bushmaster for making, distributing, and selling the AR-15 rifle. The gunman used the firearm to kill 26 people in less than five minutes at the Newtown, Connecticut, school. The action alleges negligence and wrongful death.
A U.S. district judge reviewed the case last week and accepted the contention brought forth by Bushmaster's parent firm, Remington Outdoor Company. The manufacturer argued that federal court is a more appropriate jurisdiction than Connecticut state court because the business is located in North Carolina.
The company likely made the argument because federal courts typically dismiss cases against gun manufacturers, said Jerry Reisman, a partner at Reisman, Peirez, Reisman and Capobianco in New York. Remington, he argued, “realized that if the case continues in the state court, the plaintiffs might have carved out a home court advantage and find a local judge sympathetic to their cause.”
A 2005 federal shield law prevents people from suing gun manufacturers for allowing crimes and killings to happen with their products, he said. The legislation includes an exception for cases where businesses should realize a firearm could be used to harm another individual.
“Many members of Congress, many members of state legislatures, come from rural communities in which guns are popular. Many people hunt, many people use guns for recreational purposes. But guns, because of their prevalence, fall into the hands of criminals and are most often used in crimes and often end up in homicides,” Reisman told msnbc.
RELATED: Home of Sandy Hook shooter to be destroyed
In their legal motion, the families said the rifle shouldn't have been entrusted to the general public because it is a military-style assault weapon that is unsuited for civilian use, “engineered to deliver maximum carnage with extreme efficiency.” Individuals deemed mentally unfit to operate the weapon can gain access to the firearm, they added. The families ask that the company admits accountability for the consequences of selling the rifle.
Nine of the families involved include victims' parents and spouses. The tenth representative is a teacher who was shot multiple times, but survived.
The defendants in the case also include Camfour, a distributor of firearms, and the now-closed East Windsor store where the gunman's mother bought the Bushmaster rifle, according to the Associated Press.
The parents of Jesse Lewis and Noah Pozner, two of the first-graders who died in the massacre, earlier this month filed a lawsuit against Newtown and the Newtown Board of Education. They allege inadequate security at the building where the gunman killed their children. Both families also are included in the lawsuit against Bushmaster.
The Republican Party's ascendant libertarian wing has introduced a new vitality into the sclerotic and increasingly aged GOP. In recent years, the party has slouched under the weight of its own contradictory approaches to questions of public policy. A party that rails against government intervention into private affairs yet defends social engineering like federal incentives to marry and have children confuses its would-be supporters. A GOP that rages against President Barack Obama's application of drone warfare in an ever expanding list of battlefields around the world yet defends the principle of an unconstrained global war on terror cannot long avoid reconciling those contradictory viewpoints. The ongoing internal debate in the Republican Party is healthy. Opponents of the GOP who celebrate what they derisively mock as a “civil war” are celebrating a pyrrhic victory as Republicans rapidly become the new agents of change.
Libertarianism as a governing philosophy does, however, have its limits. The nearly two-year-long humanitarian and geopolitical nightmare unfolding in Syria has exposed one of those limits. The brand of libertarianism that rejects America's role in the world cannot be adopted by the Republican Party writ large. Why? Because it is incumbent on the United States to maintain the stewardship of a global order which has resulted in relative peace and stability since the end of the Cold War. The bulk of this great responsibility, which rests on the shoulders of America's lawmakers, cannot be shrugged. Libertarians outside the closed-door classified security briefings, to which the nation's elected officials are privy, do not have to confront the sobering reality of the many threats to global security. As such, they are free to proselytize for the most amoral, egocentric form of non-interventionism couched in the moralistic language common among pace activists.
The charge that chemical arms were used in Syria is not without precedent, but the recent revelations are the most detailed and have come the closest to being independently confirmed. 26 people were killed in in the Syrian city of Aleppo when a rocket allegedly containing a chemical aerosol agent exploded. Both the rebels and the Syrian regime are blaming each other. Whether that aerosol was a nerve agent continues to be debated, but it is an academic debate. The use of pesticides and herbicides in military conflicts is also prohibited by international humanitarian law.
White House Press Sec. Jay Carney said Tuesday that there is no evidence chemical weapons were used. State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland echoed Carney when she said there is “no reason to believe the allegations” that weapons of mass destruction were used in Syria.
Those assertions were, however, contradicted by bipartisan members of Congress. On Tuesday, both the chairs of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees told the press that there was a “high probability” that chemical weapons were used. “We need that final verification, but given everything we know over the last year and a half, I would come to the conclusion that they are either positioned for use, and ready to do that, or in fact have been used,” said Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI).
“The White House has to make some decision in this. I think the days are becoming more desperate. The regime is more desperate,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) added. “We know where the chemical weapons are. It's not a secret that they are there, and I think the probabilities are very high that we're going into some very dark times, and I think the White House needs to be prepared.”
It is understandable why the White House would seek to make equivocating statements regarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria. If acknowledged and confirmed, the pressure to act in the defense of Syria's civilians caught in the line of fire of these indiscriminant weapons would be irresistible.
Prohibitions against the battlefield use of chemical weapons have a long history. The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 as well as a slew of United Nation's resolutions prohibiting their use against sovereign powers during an armed conflict are clear, but international law is far murkier regarding the use of chemical weapons against a nation's own citizens. Legal opinions are divergent when it relates to whether the use of chemical weapons justifies foreign intervention, but the international legal code designed to preserve maximum sovereignty is distinct from the moral imperatives that such a humanitarian crisis presents.
And what is the libertarian response to this imminent and rapidly unfolding crisis? If one were to peruse the preeminent libertarian intellectual publication Reason Magazine as of this writing, the answer is nothing. Save for a few aggregated news reports regarding the disaster in Syria, that magazine's stable of bright, capable, and deductive authors have yet to weigh in. Doubtless, like the intellectuals on the left, when they do get around to addressing the crisis, their focus would be on the potential pitfalls that Western intervention in Syria would present for the intervening power, and not the suffering inside Syria and the threat that nation's civil war poses to the region as that conflict spills over Syria's borders.
It is not just the Syrian conflict that has presented Libertarian thought leaders with a moral conundrum. Across the globe, the international order hashed out at the end of the Second World War has begun to unravel. An op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday by Eliot Cohen details some of the global conflicts smoldering today that threaten global stability.
“In East Asia, an assertive China has bullied the Philippines (with which the U.S. has a 61-year-old defense pact) over the Spratly islands, and China has pressed its claims on Japan (a 53-year-old defense pact) over the Senkaku Islands,” Cohen writes.
“In Europe, an oil-rich Russia is rebuilding its conventional arsenal while modernizing (as have China and Pakistan) its nuclear arsenal,” he continues. “Russia has been menacing its East European neighbors, including those, like Poland, that have offered to host elements of a NATO missile-defense system to protect Europe.”
In the Persian Gulf, American policy was laid down by Jimmy Carter in his 1980 State of the Union address with what became the Carter Doctrine: “An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force.” America's Gulf allies may not have treaties to rely upon—but they do have decades of promises and the evidence of two wars that the U.S. would stand by them. Today they wait for the long-promised (by Presidents Obama and George W. Bush) nuclear disarmament of a revolutionary Iranian government that has been relentless in its efforts to intimidate and subvert Iran's neighbors. They may wait in vain.
The United States cannot foster the formation of a vacuum of global power in perpetuity without consequence. The return of the Great Game is upon us. Outside the halls of power, the nation's commentariat does not see that as so great a threat, but fortunately that sentiment is not shared by either America's prominent Republican or Democratic elected leaders. That may change as the GOP's internal recalibration continues.
A Republican Party that embraces libertarianism should not do so uncritically. Though this generation of Americans did not seek to be the inheritors of a global order which rests on America as the sole guarantor of international security, this is the world they were born into. It is a responsibility that America and the West can not eschew without catastrophic consequences.
The Republican Party has a proud legacy of understanding and accepting the historical burden that the U.S. must bear. The party and the nation are forever criticized for comprehending that responsibility. This criticism is often leveled at them from an intellectual class which enjoys the fruits of prosperity and peace, but refuses to acknowledge the sacrifices required to safeguard it.
The GOP's revitalization must come with a healthy dose of libertarian philosophy both at home and abroad, but the Republican Party should never become a party that abandons its role in the world. An America that abdicates its role would become quite popular in the world's coffee shops and faculty lounges. But such a shift would presage the return of the functional equivalent of a multipolar world, yielding to the increased likelihood that ascendant powers could miscalculate in their unending efforts to seek advantage over their neighbors. Great power wars would become a reality again. It is the responsibility of the United States to prevent this return to the historical norm from coming to pass, whether we like it or not.

Story highlights "We're all devastated," says gunman's brother
The brother called authorities after hearing about shots at the mall
The gunman is identified as 20-year-old Richard Shoop
No one else was injured
A gunman who opened fire at a New Jersey mall Monday night later holed up in a back room and shot himself in the head, authorities say.
No one else was injured in the mall shooting.
Richard Shoop's body was found at 3:20 a.m. Tuesday in an obscure part of Westfield Garden State Plaza mall, hours after he fired at least six bullets without striking anyone in the massive shopping center.
He acted alone, authorities say.
"We know that his intent was either suicide or to do something that would cause police to shoot him, which we call 'suicide by cop,' " Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli told CNN's "New Day."

"He had more than enough opportunity to be able to shoot other people," including a group adjacent to him, but he didn't, Molinelli said. "Instead, he shot randomly at different locations."
Shots hit the ceiling, an escalator, an elevator and a storefront, the prosecutor said.
The reasons for the shooting remain unclear. Shoop used narcotic drugs and sold drugs as well, Molinelli said.
And he left behind a note referring to the idea that the "end was coming," Molinelli said. "That could mean going to jail, getting arrested, or it could mean suicide." Authorities don't know whether Shoop left the note immediately before going to the mall.
Shoop's brother, Kevin, called authorities after hearing about the shooting and said he thought Shoop might be the gunman, Molinelli said. Police did not confirm the shooter's identity until they found his body.
"We're not sure exactly what caused him to do this, and we're all devastated," Kevin Shoop told reporters Tuesday.
"My brother intended to harm nobody else but himself. He just, sadly, decided to make ... an act of self-indulgence by taking his own life publicly. And it's a tragedy to us all," he said.
Pandemonium
The melee started about 9:20 p.m. ET Monday night, just as the shopping center was about to close. Thousands of people were still in the mall, Molinelli said.
Shoop, dressed all in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, walked through the mall with a rifle modified to look like an AK-47. The rifle was taken from Shoop's brother, Molinelli said.
Allie Cozic, who works in the mall, said everyone was "running to wherever they could."
"It was almost like when you're watching a horror movie and the killer is walking slowly. That's what it seemed like," she said. "He was wearing all black. It almost looked like body armor of some kind. As soon as I saw the gun, I just turned and ran."

Eddie Kahmann, another mall employee, said he heard six or seven gunshots.
"There was just people running like crazy, so I quickly just closed my doors, ran to the back, turned off all the lights, music and everything, just to stay hidden," he said.
The shooting sent panic through the mall and set off a frenzied hunt for the gunman. In the early hours of the search, officials weren't sure whether the shooter was still inside or outside the 2 million-square-foot building.
Officers did not fire any shots, Molinelli said, and there was only slight damage to the mall.
Even as Shoop's body lay in a remote room in a construction area, fear permeated the mall.
More than 100 shoppers were still hiding inside stores early Tuesday morning, unsure of whether they could safely come out. Officers worked to evacuate each store.
Signs of trouble
Shoop, 20, was known by local law enforcement. He had a history of drug use and abuse, Molinelli said.
"He at least thought that he was reaching a point where there was no recourse but to take his own life," Molinelli said.
The owner of a pizza shop where Shoop had been working for about a year said he was a good, trustworthy worker. Dod Geges, owner of Victor's Pizza Shop, describes Shoop as a nice, quiet guy.
But in the last two weeks, "something was off" about Shoop, Geges said, adding that he "wasn't his usual self."
Geges' brother Robert Gega, who manages the restaurant, said Shoop was working 60 hours a week and "sobering up."
"He wasn't drinking or drugging," Gega said, adding that Shoop had good friends and never gave an indication of contemplating suicide. "He would never hurt anyone."

Researchers at University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa's Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) were recently awarded a $1.026 million grant from NASA to develop coral disease forecasting models for Hawaiʻi, U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands and the Great Barrier Reef. Megan Donahue, principal investigator and HIMB researcher, and Jamie Caldwell, HIMB post-doctoral fellow on the project, will lead an international team as they combine field work, experimental work, previously collected data and satellite data to predict disease risk up to six months before an expected outbreak.
Scientists Mark Eakin, Scott Heron and Bernardo Vargas-Angel from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coral Reef Watch and Coral Reef Ecosystem Program are co-investigators on the grant, and Tracy Ainsworth and Bill Leggat of James Cook University in Australia are key participants on the four-year project.
Improved management tools may reduce disease
Coral diseases are considered one of the major contributors to coral reef decline worldwide. Corals are more likely to contract diseases when they are stressed; for example, due to poor land use practices that increase runoff, and climate change, which warms the ocean.
“Coral reefs support over 500 million people worldwide through coastline protection, livelihoods, and food security; they are an incredibly biodiverse and important ecological system,” said Caldwell. “Better decision support tools, such as these forecasting models, will help us target critical areas of management concern. We hope this project will highlight local environmental stressors that increase disease susceptibility, allowing us to prioritize particular management practices—for instance, reducing fertilizer runoff from agriculture and golf courses.”
Currently, NOAA Coral Reef Watch produces an experimental coral disease outbreak risk assessment tool based on one coral disease. The new grant will allow the research team to refine and expand the model for multiple coral diseases and to new regions.
“Predictive tools can guide reef managers and scientists to where outbreaks are most likely, which can target response actions to minimize stressors in those locations,” said Eakin. “Importantly, survey observations from these sites can feed back into the development process to further improve the tools.”
Field surveys and satellite data integrated into forecasting tool
This research will make use of coral health observations from previously collected underwater visual surveys conducted since 2004 from researchers at academic institutions, state and federal agencies from Hawaiʻi, Guam, American Samoa and Australia. Targeted fieldwork will further aid development of the models and provide insight into the mechanisms of disease onset.
“What I love about modeling these relationships with data from a broad geographic region is that we can start to distinguish patterns about outbreak events, which are notoriously difficult to predict in space and time,” said Caldwell. “Moreover, once we start to quantify these relationships, we can identify specific gaps in our knowledge and design future experiments to fill in that missing information, which will ultimately feed back into improving the model predictions.”
The anticipated coral disease forecasting products will update automatically with incoming data of sea surface temperature from satellites and climate models, along with other variables known to affect coral health such as rainfall and water quality, and alert any interested parties of potential outbreak events. NOAA will continue to distribute these products after the grant ends.
Should an outbreak occur during the funding period, the team will intensively survey those sites to better understand the coral stress response during the rise and fall of an outbreak event. Using cutting edge techniques pioneered by Ainsworth and Leggat, the researchers will help determine species-specific responses to environmental stressors, prior to visible lesions.
“This aspect of the work is really exciting because underwater visual surveys rely on disease lesions we can see with the naked eye, at which point the coral is already very affected by the disease,” said Caldwell. “Ultimately we want to predict pre-visible signs of stress so we can target management efforts to reduce stressors before a disease arises.”
“The models we are developing will improve our understanding of when, where, and why coral diseases occur,” said Donahue. “To make sure these products are developed in a way that is useful, we will host a workshop on June 26 to bring together scientists with the managers who will likely use the models once they are developed.”

With dozens of sanitation and safety violations cited, state health inspectors ordered Off The Traxx Sports Bar and Grille to close temporarily Friday, according to a report.
The Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation ordered the downtown Melbourne restaurant, located at 918 East New Haven Drive, to close following Friday's inspection.

No one answered the phone at the business early Friday night.
Inspectors said they found flies in the kitchen, as well as roaches and evidence of rats in the storage area. The staff was using pesticide strips to deal with the issue, but the state cited the restaurant for having the strips in improper places, such as the food preparation area.
Inspectors also found several food items that had been opened but not cooked within seven days, such as a tub of red chili pepper soup with an April 27 date.
The state directive for the restaurant is to address all the violations before re-opening. That included 15 high-priority violations among the 61 cited.

David Dobbs' 13-year-old daughter has type 1 diabetes. Since 2015, the 59-year-old freelance writer and author has relied on Obamacare, officially known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), to help pay for his daughter's insulin, blood testing supplies and other medical needs. But as the endless series of cliffhangers over the fate of the ACA continues, Dobbs says he's starting to feel hunted.
Without insurance, diabetes treatment alone would cost his family about $20,000 to $30,000 a year, he estimates – and that's if nothing goes wrong and prompts an astronomically expensive hospitalization.
For Dobbs and millions of others like him, the continuing unpredictable battles over the law can feel like an assault on their fundamental sense of security.
If the ACA's protections are removed, middle-class Americans will be even further exposed to one of the most toxic sources of stress that accompanies inequality: uncertainty.
Uncertainty – such as not knowing whether you will face possibly catastrophic medical costs – keeps the brain's stress systems at a dangerously high level of arousal, according to Bruce McEwen, professor of neuroscience at Rockefeller University and one of the world's leading experts on the health effects of stress. “In a state of constant activity, [these systems] can produce effects like elevated blood pressure that can lead, over time, to cardiovascular disease,” he says.
Dozens of studies in both humans and animals show how uncertainty makes stress harder to manage and therefore more dangerous. The best weapons against stress-related harm, research shows, are social support and a sense of meaningful control over one's life and actions. However, being unable to predict and prepare for contingencies can undermine both.

The battle over healthcare has been full of it. The first repeal bill mobilized a massive resistance, before failing to win enough votes and dying. But then, it seemed to arise from the grave: only to be vanquished by an 11th-hour veto from brain cancer-stricken Senator John McCain.
And even that wasn't the end of it: up against a September deadline, the bill staggered back to life, only to again be stymied by the slimmest margin. And now, President Trump is trying to sabotage Obamacare via executive order.
Great for a series plotline; not so great to live through.
While Dobbs immediately acknowledges that he and his wife, a freelance editor, are privileged to do work they love, facing a future of completely unpredictable expenses and a child who could be forever uninsurable is not what Americans have typically expected of a middle-class life, suggesting that his family's life is disposable or “we're happy to throw you aside,” Dobbs says.
In short, the ACA may not have made everyone healthy, but Donald Trump's determined efforts to kill it may itself be harming people – even if he doesn't succeed.
For the millions of families whose lives and finances may hang in the balance, enduring this cruel, chaotic and compassionless political process is both enraging and disempowering. “It turns what would be a financial difficulty in our ability to close the gap between what we make and what we need to cover extra expenses into a sort of existential disadvantage,” says Dobbs.
Indeed, at the time that the ACA passed, medical debt was the No 1 cause of bankruptcy in America. Upon its implementation, there was a 50% drop in debt filings, which experts surmise was related. Today, if key provisions are eliminated, the threat of suddenly losing everything because of an unforeseen illness or accident once again looms large.
McEwen, the neuroscientist, adds: “Don't forget that when a person is aroused by uncertainty, they may not sleep very well, may eat comfort foods, smoke, drink – or all of the above.” Obviously, these attempts to relieve stress can themselves be unhealthy.
Research on how working conditions affect health also emphasizes just how dangerous uncontrollable and unpredictable stress can be. Having little control over your work, for example, more than doubles your risk for coronary heart disease, according to a study of around 10,000 British civil servants. Another study found a 30% increase in risk for stroke.
“The mind is the crucial gateway between the social environment and illness,” says Sir Michael Marmot, the lead researcher on the study of civil servants. If you feel well-equipped and supported in facing the challenges of your job, the effects of stress on health may even be positive – but harm comes from conditions that leave you unprepared and make your efforts feel futile.
In fact, the most health-damaging form of workplace stress involves being held responsible for conditions or outcomes that you actually don't have the power to change. Sales jobs, for instance, are often heavily reliant on commissions – but salespeople can't change product flaws that deter repeat customers, for example. They're also often squeezed between angry customers and rigid work rules.
Most jobs with such “high demand/low control” characteristics have low status, which accounts for part of why having low status is harmful to health. And with 94% of all job growth between 2005 and 2015 coming in the freelance, part-time and “independent contractor” category, more people may face conditions over which they feel less control.
By itself, however, uncertainty doesn't have to be a harmful aspect of stress – the real problem is when it is also accompanied by a sense of powerlessness. A series of rather horrifying experiments conducted in the 1970s by Martin Seligman and his colleagues illustrates this vividly.
Rats or dogs were yoked together in a cage where they would receive electric shocks at unpredictable times. But one animal had control: it had access to a lever that allowed it to turn the electricity off as soon as the shock started. The other animals merely experienced both unpredictable and uncontrollable shocks.
If we don't focus on why people overeat, we will never solve obesity Read more
The mental and physical health effects were profound. The animals that controlled their experience were unharmed. The ones that could not escape the shock, however, suffered from impaired immune response to diseases like cancer, as well as a syndrome called “learned helplessness”. In this state, animals simply withdraw and stop trying to improve their situation. Even if they are later offered clear escape routes, they don't bother to try to flee. Essentially, they give up hope.
In fact, the brain physiology of this state is so much like that seen in depression that similar experiments are commonly used to test antidepressants: effective medications delay the surrender to despair.
Sadly, the political conditions we face now risk being an unwitting experiment in learned helplessness: our sense of powerlessness in the face of uncaring leadership is continually reinforced in debates like the one over our healthcare system. Though huge majorities oppose repeal – as does virtually every stakeholder in the healthcare industry, including doctors, patients and insurer groups – the ultimate decision was repeatedly made by a tiny group of Republican senators in a process that was far from democratic. Now, it lies with the courts and the president.
This is another of the vicious cycles produced by today's inequality: it increases political polarization, the unchecked power of elites and overall helplessness.
Dobbs compares his family's uncertainty over their medical care to being in a horror movie. “It is like the zombies are coming,” he says. “They come and they come and they come and so far every time, just as they are getting the hinges loose on the front door, dawn comes and they have to leave.”
Yet, he adds: “We know that night will come again.”
We're all used to economic forecasts. We're also used to them being wrong. But there was a time when forecasts were new and exciting, and people were genuinely surprised when they didn't pan out. This was during the first decades of the previous century, an era that Harvard Business School historian Walter Friedman chronicles in his new book Fortune Tellers: The Story of America's First Economic Forecasters.
The forecasters Friedman profiles are Roger Babson, founder of Babson College, whose simple “Babsonchart” of economic activity helped make him probably the most famous of the lot during his lifetime; Irving Fisher, the Yale professor whose 1929 pronouncements about a “permanently high plateau” for stock prices are mocked to this day but whose fingerprints are also all over modern academic economics; John Moody, who along with making economic forecasts created the now-controversial credit ratings business; and C.J. Bullock and Warren Persons of the Harvard Economic Service, who are almost completely forgotten now but briefly wielded global influence. Friedman also devotes a chapter to Columbia economist Wesley Mitchell and Commerce Secretary (that was his job until he was elected president in 1928) Herbert Hoover, who weren't forecasters but whose joint interest in the business cycle led to the creation of many of the economic indicators we use today.
The book is fun reading, but what makes it especially interesting for any regular consumer of modern economic forecasts is how little today's forecasters have improved on the methods of the 1910s and 1920s. Yes, there's better data and more sophistication in today's forecasts, but the basic principles were already being worked out by Babson, Fisher, and the like a century ago.
I interviewed Friedman about his book for an HBR Ideacast, which you can listen to below. What follows are edited excerpts from that and a post-Ideacast conversation.

There's a lot of failure in your book.
Friedman: There is a lot of failure in my book, but I think forecasting is a very maligned industry. Most people look at the history of forecasting and think of it as a march of folly, because they look at whether [forecasters] have become more accurate over time, and the truth is they really haven't. No one's been able to produce a reliable method of making predictions of where the economy's going, and they won't be able to. But in the effort to forecast they've done a lot of great things — they've introduced leading indicators, they've created econometric models, they've created important institutions like the National Bureau of Economic Research, and they've come up with ideas of how to conceptualize the economy.
The very idea that there's this thing called the economy was something new.
Everybody talks about Silicon Valley being this bunch of entrepreneurs who created the computer industry in their garages. This was a bunch of entrepreneurs who gathered data either in their basements or in some subdivision of their office, and invented the idea of the economy. They made it tangible, so that people got a sense that the businesses around the United States were connected in some way, that they all went up and down together, and that what somebody did in Cleveland had an impact on what somebody did in New York.
Your book describes a rivalry between Babson and Fisher.
Babson really believes in historical trends. He's just a trend analyst. Fisher doesn't think trends are important at all; instead he believes in causation. He tries to figure out how the economy actually works. What effect does it have if we innovate? What effect does it have if we change the way we manage firms? What effect does it have if we plow earnings back [into firms]? Fisher tried to find ways to quantify these changes, and the effects they would have.
In the late 20s the Babson approach and the Fisher approach came into direct collision. Who won that battle?
If you were an investor, you liked Babson much better, because by luck he got it right in fall of 1929. Whereas Fisher, who gets it wrong in 1929 — and loses everything, including his house — his ideas start to spread in the post-World War II period. Fisher's ideas really catch on, whereas Babson is much more marginal as a figure.
So this move to a more theoretical approach, has it resulted in better forecasts?
I think the move in forecasting that really has made a difference is the transition from the idea of a fixed business cycle — that is to say, a business cycle that you can't alter in any way and that is a bit like a meteorological cycle — to one in which the government can actually try to flatten cycles. That really has changed things.
Is there a risk that you get overconfident because of that? One of the things that happened in the '20s is that things kept going so well, and the forecasters who predicted a continued boom were right again and again. If you get very confident that government knows what it's doing and can manage the economy well, does that increase risk at all?
I think the real danger is believing that any forecaster really knows what he or she is doing. One of the problems that people have with forecasting is that they tend to look at past accuracy as an indication whether or not to follow a forecaster, when in fact past accuracy is much more often based on luck, and what you really have to do is try to figure out what these forecasters are thinking about, what their reasons are, and then you can decide whether you want to follow one or another. If you just blindly look as to whether they got it right or wrong, then you're probably going to fall for a guru one of these days.
That fits a theme that goes through this book, which is that you shouldn't really entirely trust any of these people, yet at the same time they're valuable to the economy.
I think you need to think of forecasts a bit like treasure maps, in that you always have to be skeptical of the person who would want to print and sell treasure maps en masse, when it's much better for you to simply keep a treasure map, if you actually have a valid one, and get the treasure yourself. You have to keep in mind that these people are trying to sell their predictions, and that persuasion is as big a part of this industry as prediction is.
Who's your favorite?
I think Babson is my favorite, because it's just so hard to figure out whether he believed what he was promoting or not. He builds his whole idea about forecasting on Sir Isaac Newton, yet how can a rational person actually believe that booms and busts precisely equal out over time? And what does that say about the craziness of the profession? Who actually thinks that they can figure out where the economy's headed with some certainty? You can't really publish forecasts unless you have a conviction that you've figured something out. And yet most rational people go about that only with some real doubt.
The people who doubt ultimately will fail, because when they get a prediction wrong they'll throw up their hands, they'll say their model was wrong. And those who really believe that they've got the right method will just explain away all of their failures and just keep pushing their model.
That sounds a lot like Philip Tetlock's hedgehogs and foxes, where the people who keep hammering at it and don't care if their forecasts are wrong are more likely to be wrong. It's the foxes, the people who are willing to take in new information and don't have one overarching theory of the world, who are better at prediction. But what you're saying is you're never going to make it in the forecasting business if you have that approach.
I think there's a big marketing side to this story, and the ones who were good marketers ultimately succeeded. The pioneers were all basically people with a very strong sales sense. Moody succeeds because he's very aggressive at selling. He tells these stories about going on the train and putting his prospectus on every open seat. Babson sends his salesmen all around the country. Fisher believes in syndicating columns and getting his predictions in front of every newspaper reader every Monday, which is another smart thing to do. They're all very good at that.
The ones that are really bad at that are the Harvard group. They're completely useless. They believe that they'll just basically market to their alumni. Well, it's a very small pool, so they don't make any money, and partway through the '20s they just decide that they can't make any money doing forecasts anyway, so that they'll just try to keep enough [subscribers] so that they'll make their budget every year and try to influence the field rather than make money.
And it's only $20!
Xbox One golf launch title Powerstar Golf didn't gel with me the first time I played it, but after seeing the depth of some of its systems last week I feel better about it.
Its RPG-ish leveling system and cloud-based competitive features sound like something I could really get into.
Powerstar Golf (Xbox One)
Developer: Zoe Mode
Publisher: Microsoft
Release Date: November 22, 2013
In Powerstar Golf, everything has stats, and the level of customization is super deep. All characters have their strengths and weaknesses, and you'll modify what they can do for you with equipment choices. Each of the six characters have their own play style (long driver, accuracy putter, etc.), but through equipment choices you can tweak their abilities a bit. Characters also have their own special abilities. One character, Henry, has his ball splitting into five on the green, with the closest ball to the hole being the one he'll play from on the next shot. Reiko, another character, has the ability to magnetize the pin, which will have her shot drawing closer to the hole upon landing.
Even caddies help you modify your abilities with their individual special abilities. For example, one might let you preview putts before making shots. They all have perks, too. You might have a better chance of skipping your shot over water with one, while another might change the how greatly wind speed affects your shot. In a pinch, you can even borrow friends' caddies to help you out.
All of the gear in Powerstar also has stats, and with over 400 pieces to choose from, there is plenty of freedom when it comes to tweaking your stats. As you level, you're able to buy more gear, working to gain full gear sets. Sets give additional stat bonuses, too. Beyond this, some gear pieces are character-specific, giving huge perks when equipped.
If this all wasn't enough, there are also round-specific boosters to be added. You can choose boosts to help your XP or putting distance, for example.
With any golf game, you're up against the course as well as the environment. That's usually enough depth. But Powerstar adds so many layers of customization that it seems you could spend all day tweaking your character and gear.
I'm surprised at just how social and competitive Powerstar Golf is aiming to be. Even playing alone, through the game's Rival mode, you're up against the cloud data of your friends. In a match I tried, I found that I was constantly being updated with how my plays compared to others'. A long drive showed my ball flying past the previous record holder's marker, with his score and marker shattering to be replaced by mine. The records of all your friends are clearly visible on the course through these markers, and are updated instantly as you and your friends play.
If you're playing against a friend's cloud data, you'll see the game exactly as they played it. This means that everything from their shots and flubs to their outfit and club choice are shown. It's like you've rewound time and plugged yourself into their game. This means that you can enjoy competitive play at any time.
What's neat is that if you win, you'll gain experience. But, if you lose, your friend, even offline, will get experience for beating you virtually.
As we've covered before, the shot system is the standard three-point one we know from Hot Shots Golf, complete with the ability to add spin. The game offers absolutely nothing new in that respect. But the customization and special abilities are interesting, and the cloud-powered social connectivity has the potential to keep you engaged.
Again, I'm not a fan of the art style or presentation, but neither are going to hinder the fun to be had going up against friends' data. Being able to play competitively at any time sounds fantastic. And so does the price -- $20.
Powershot Golf will be available for download at Xbox One's launch.

Hi everyone, welcome back to my Peru-Bolivia AAR without most of the Peru.
The Republic of North Peru has been abolished, instead being divided into its various departments under the oversight of Supreme Protector Jose Ballivian.
The landowners begin to clamour for formal representation within the government beyond the Confederal Council, so the legislature is made bicameral, with a new body- the Chamber of Deputies- created, filled with candidates elected by the landowners.
The economy continues its transition to a civilian one, with public spending increasing.
Taxes remain astronomically high, but luckily no one can read their bills anyway.
The retirement of donkeys from the military makes moving to the Confederation much more appealing to Europeans, but this does little in reality to offset the fact that it's a complete shithole and no one has any money.
Weak and spineless landowners suggest to Ballivian that the Argentines might be willing to hand over the lost border territories if he were to calm down a little over provinces that are clearly out of reach.
He scoffs in their faces and appropriates their land.
oh for fucks sake not this shit again
Fearing increased centralization and the end of the South Peruvian Republic, President Rodado attempts to break away from the Confederation with the support of local traitorous landowners.
Having failed to permanently heal the divisions in the Confederation, Ballivian resigns after only two years as Supreme Protector. The Confederal Council declares Jose Miguel de Velasco, the President of the Republic of Bolivia, his successor.
He immediately makes his centralist goals known, as the first thing he does is abolish the Republic of Bolivia, dividing it into its respective departments as had been done with Peru.
The standing army is significantly diminished after four years of war, and is caught in Puerto Maldonado whilst in transit to La Paz.
Velasco commences mobilization, which unfortunately means I have to talk about Gonzalo some more.
Conscripts from Lima, surprisingly, are the first to form a new brigade.
The Central Americans are also having trouble keeping their union together, although it's unlikely they'll succeed.
also gonzalo's brigade was formed
Donkeys are also subject to conscription laws.
Inspired by General Rodado's defiance, the subjugated North Peruvians begin their own rebellion, centred on Lima.
Cut off from the northern departments save for temporary supply routes through Puerto Maldonado, there is little that can currently be done about the rebellion.
The Confederal Council of 1840 is formed. Other than fluctuations throughout the year due to the establishment of the Chamber of Deputies, change is minimal.
also more horses wow
Having to re-adjust the economy yet again, funding for the civil service is cut somewhat.
The new economic plan is implemented, which incorporates elements of laissez-faire and global trade.
Gonzalo can now sell his stale, mouldy, soggy bread on the world market, much to his delight.
and we can mass produce fancy shirts with slogans too
Perfect.
The implementation of partial laissez-faire economics has improved the economy somewhat, so the civil service receives full funding once again.
The extent of centralisation in the Confederation on the 22nd of March, 1840. Focus is also being put on the professionalization of the army.
The civil service is most effective in the area around La Paz, while much of the civil service from the former Republic of North Peru has been reorganised into its various departments, weakening it somewhat.
Confederal control has been re-established over Puerto Maldonado, linking La Paz with Lima once again.
The army under General Arteaga, replacing Jose Ballivian, is sent to Lima to suppress the Peruvian separatists.
The poorly organised rebels are dislodged, and are later fully rooted out at Huaraz.
The Cajamarca rebels fall shortly afterwards, being able to smell Gonzalo from the other side of the Andes.
Ica is occupied by the Confederal Army, as part of a plan to cut General Rodado off from foreign trade.
Having apparently forgiven the Brazilians over the Cisplatine War, or perhaps fearing that stability would eventually return to Peru-Bolivia, General Rosas of Argentina signs a formal military alliance with the South American hegemon.
twats
Well, that was predictable.
It does, however, boost morale slightly for the breakaway Peruvians.
That morale is quickly lost.
Velasco is able to command the support of most of the Confederal Council at the turn of 1841, but faces dissatisfaction with his centralist goals.
we kill some nerds and take their lunch money
Ica falls.
The army continues south to Arequipa.
IT WAS GONZALO HE FUCKING DID IT
A second professional brigade is formed in Cochabamba, with real life horses this time.
The indigenous Quechua in Lima protest against direct rule from La Paz, despite the generous (very limited) autonomy we have given to the Lima Department.
we kill them and take their lunch money too
The army continues its expansion.
Political parties are now allowed to form, but any public campaigns are constantly harassed by Velasco supporters with rifles.
Arequipa also falls. The fall of South Peru is imminent.
Satisfied with the state of the civil service in La Paz, Velasco begins to expand it in Lima and surrounding departments, not least to tighten his iron fist.
The army enters Tacna, the capital of South Peru.
Unfortunately, General Rodado has gone the way of Santa Cruz and has also escaped, fleeing to France.
The Confederal Council of 1842 is formed.
Support for Velasco's Partido Popular decreases further compared to last year.
The formation of three different parties- the incumbent Partido Popular, the Partido Liberal and the reactionary Partido Nacionalista coupled with the establishment of the Chamber of Deputies has made Peru-Bolivia, nominally at least, a democracy.
At a state banquet in the Presidential Palace in La Paz, Velasco proclaims the establishment of the Andine Federation, and that elections to the Chamber of Deputies will begin.
The Confederation is over. We do not need the consent of the constituent republics to rule. The new Federation shall extend throughout the entire Andes, and further!
once we're done with south peru of course
The important parts of South America on the 21st of January, 1842.
The Andine Federation has been almost continuously at war for six years.
Here are all the landowners in the country.
Most of them are of the minority Spanish-descended Criollos, with the remainder being tribal chiefs in the Amazon interior.
They are largely conservatives, with sizable reactionary and liberal tendencies.
and are also illiterate
In line with the increasingly liberal nature of the Andine economy, President Velasco announces his intentions to lower tariffs slightly.
It's not going to happen any time soon though since there were never any anyway.
Taxes are lowered across the board for Andine citizens, although they are dropped significantly for the landowners in order to keep them satisfied.
This has the unfortunate side effect of giving Gonzalo a shred of economic freedom.
A box of artisanal t-shirts is shipped to Emperor Pedro II, improving relations with Brazil significantly.
Tacna is occupied, splitting the country in twain.
Much of the interior in the South Peruvian Andes has descended into anarchy, without government nor contact with the rest of the world.
much like the UK post-brexit then ayyyy /s
Velasco shocks the landowners by coming out in favour of limited citizenship to the indigenous peoples of the Federation.
The liberals, however, gain trust in him- a vital move, as they have been etching at the power of the military governments for some years now.
Taxes are lowered a little more, increasing Velasco's support among the broad populace- although that doesn't matter of course.
The Federal Council votes unanimously to keep Gonzalo's tax rates at 100%, ostensibly for his own well being.
Being an illiterate peasant farmer, he gladly agrees.
The Federal Army enters Cusco, the old capital of the Inca Empire, to restore order.
one faith and one faith only christ is risen kill pagan worshippers
The absolutely atrocious levels of gerrymandering ensure a complete conservative victory in the Chamber of Deputies.
The nationalists are mildly pissed because of the citizenship debacle, but the liberals aren't too fussed since a conservative landslide was predicted anyway and the Federal Council- where they had far better representation- was more powerful.
The state of the Federation's Civil Service on the 20th of September, 1842.
The state of the civil service is satisfactory in the departments around Lima, and those around La Paz are on par with modern European administrations.
The very hinterlands of northern Peru remain poorly governed, but this is not really a concern.
In unrelated news, Gonzalo is being offered a free house and farmland in Iquitos.
The Federal Council of 1843 is formed.
Relatively large swings have been made from the Partido Popular to the Partido Liberal.
Velasco placates the reactionaries by introducing minority building restrictions.
Local governors explain to them that "Velasco can't take your things if you have nothing at all."
*black guy tapping his head meme*
The Lima Dragoons are formed, increasing the size of the professional army significantly.
Cusco falls.
South Peruvian resistance has completely melted away- the only thing preventing the annexation of the former Republic is time.
The remaining landowners refuse to give in, fearing the worst.
well alright then guys looks like somebody's having a loaf of gonzalo's bread every day for ten years
hey what the fuck argentina
give that back
The Governor of Entre Rios, General Justo Jose de Urquiza, attempts to mend relations with his former enemy.
Fat chance.
Puno is completely occupied.
we're nearly done guys i promise this gets more interesting
They refuse yet again.
wait nvm
President Velasco declares the rebellion over, and the Republic of South Peru is abolished and broken up into its constituent departments.
The Andine Federation is finally at peace.
The next week is busy. Child labour is restricted by the Federal Council, Gonzalo is demobilized and can finally go back to farming, and Velasco standardizes Andine law into the South Peruvian departments.
The Federal Council determines that intellectualism needs to be advanced.
fuckin nerds
The series of recent reforms is compiled into the Treaty of La Paz, formally establishing the Andine Federation's first modern Constitution.
hoorayyy thanks guys see you next week
After its absence last week the Burrito Wrap is back with its usual three tasty stories.
Happy Birthday Tuca…
Tuca Ferreti was celebrating his sixtieth birthday this weekend and was given the perfect present as Tigres finally got their season up and running with a laboured 1-0 victory at home to Veracruz. Whilst Tuca may not look a day over 21, Tigres have been playing like a group of pensioners recently (and that's a bit harsh on the pensioners). It was more of the same on Saturday, as aside from Duenas' wonder goal the game was slow paced, lacking in urgency, and generally a rather large bore-fest.
Nonetheless, Pumas remarkable turnaround will give the Monterrey side hope that salvation is not far away. In the last edition of The Burrito Wrap we spoke about how many teams were struggling to find a second win of the season, and while the landscape has changed somewhat in the last two weeks, the unbelievable volatility of this season's Liga MX means Tigres are now only four points off 8th position. Incredibly, it is the same deficit as it was at the end of January after just four games when I wrote my piece defending the manager.
Tigres play Chivas in Guadalajara next week, then leaders Cruz Azul visit El Volcan in Round 10, before a slightly easier run of games through to the end of the season. Tigres left it late to push into the top eight last season, and if they can get something out of their next two games, a place in the Liguilla may yet look like being very achievable.
Goalkeepers, Mexico's weak point…
This may be an unpopular opinion, but it's true: Mexican goalkeepers are nearly as bad as Mexican referees. Whilst some of Mexico's most revered historical players have been goalkeepers, and of course some modern day keepers such as Ochoa and Corona buck the trend – they are very much the exceptions which prove the rule.
Yet again this week we saw a dreadful goalkeeping error from Queretaro's Edgar Hernández, as he managed to get beaten off an audacious volley from almost the halfway line by Cruz Azul's Rogelio Chávez. Let's be clear, this wasn't a lob where the keeper is too far off his line and struggles to get back – Hernandez was back in plenty of time to save the effort and had the ball come to him at a comfortable height to simply catch, but he contrived to palm the ball onto his post and consequently into the net. Take nothing away from Chavez, it was a great effort regardless, but the goalkeeping was amateurish in the extreme.
Of course, as we all know, goalkeepers have arguably the toughest job on the pitch – underappreciated when doing well, yet mistakes magnified when something goes wrong that inevitably leads to a goal. Yet it's not even just the standout howlers such as Hernandez's at the weekend that are problematic in the Liga MX – the goalkeepers all seem a bit, well… rubbish. Their positioning is generally poor, they are appalling in the air, they consistently punch the ball when they should catch it, and are generally poor shot-stoppers. Brutal but true. Barely a weekend goes by without me screaming at the TV in exasperation at another keeper's hapless performance (although, granted, it has been eased slightly by Tigres dropping Palos in recent games!).
Do Mexican club even employ goalkeeping coaches? It doesn't seem like it… I played in goal until I was about eight and a half, I'll happily give them a few pointers in exchange for a free ticket!
All Change at Rayados…
So Profe Cruz lasted a little under six months in the Monterrey hot seat, as Rayados last week followed Atlante and Morelia in instigating a mid-season managerial change.
Frankly, the decision comes as no surprise – the only surprising thing is that Monterrey's board considered sacking the much-loved Vucetich and replacing him Cruz to be a shrewd move in the first place. Fans made their feelings well-known in the 2-0 home defeat to Leon, chanting their former manager's name throughout the game.
Cruz does have a reasonably impressive CV, having won the title with Atlante and consequently leading them into the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup where they were beaten 3-1 by Barcelona in the semi-final. His insistence on playing with one striker was never going to be popular with the Rayados support, however, and his tactics looked positively doomed as soon as Humberto Suazo picked up his lengthy injury.
Despite rumours circling about Chepo being given the role, the board have wisely not replaced him with a permanent successor, opting instead to hand the reigns to Carlos Barra and José Treviño until the end of the season.
I wonder if anyone in Monterrey still have Victor's number?!

Romney made huge fortune while workers lost jobs, stockholders and creditors lost money.
Here's just one example:
In 1992, Mitt Romney was running Bain Capital, a private equity firm. Bain Capital bought American Pad & Paper Co. (Ampad) for $5 million.
Over the next several years Romney's firm bled the company dry. Hundreds of workers lost their jobs. Stockholders were left with worthless shares. Creditors and vendors were paid less than 50 cents on the dollar. While they were exploiting the company, Romney's firm charged Ampad millions of dollars in "management fees." In all, Romney and his investors reaped more than $100 million dollars from the deal.
Last summer the Boston Globe published this account of Mitt Romney's acquisition of Ampad while he was running Bain Capital:
From "The Making of Mitt Romney,"
Boston Globe, June 26, 2007 In 1992, Bain Capital acquired American Pad & Paper, or Ampad, from Mead Corp., embarking on a ''roll-up strategy'' in which a firm buys up similar companies in the same industry in order to expand revenues and cut costs. Through Ampad, Bain bought several other office supply makers, borrowing heavily each time. By 1999, Ampad's debt reached nearly $400 million, up from $11 million in 1993, according to government filings. Sales grew, too - for a while. But by the late 1990s, foreign competition and increased buying power by superstores like Bain-funded Staples sliced Ampad's revenues. The result: Ampad couldn't pay its debts and plunged into bankruptcy. Workers lost jobs and stockholders were left with worthless shares. Bain Capital, however, made money - and lots of it. The firm put just $5 million into the deal, but realized big returns in short order. In 1995, several months after shuttering a plant in Indiana and firing roughly 200 workers, Bain Capital borrowed more money to have Ampad buy yet another company, and pay Bain and its investors more than $60 million - in addition to fees for arranging the deal. Bain Capital took millions more out of Ampad by charging it $2 million a year in management fees, plus additional fees for each Ampad acquisition. In 1995 alone, Ampad paid Bain at least $7 million. The next year, when Ampad began selling shares on public stock exchanges, Bain Capital grabbed another $2 million fee for arranging the initial public offering - on top of the $45 million to $50 million Bain reaped by selling some of its shares. Bain Capital didn't escape Ampad's eventual bankruptcy unscathed. It held about one-third of Ampad's shares, which became worthless. But while as many as 185 workers near Buffalo lost jobs in a 1999 plant closing, Bain Capital and its investors ultimately made more than $100 million on the deal.
Alongside the article, the Boston Globe also published a separate chart showing the timeline of the Ampad acquisition. Below is also text from the chart:
Text from Globe's accompanying chart (above) on the Ampad acquisition:
The trailer for Showtime's upcoming seventh season of Homeland features former CIA agent Carrie Mathison squaring off against a power-hungry, corrupt new president.
In the trailer, President Keene (Elizabeth Marvel) has apparently arrested more than 200 people connected to an assassination attempt on her, including Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who later apparently becomes the president's new National Security Advisor.
Meanwhile, Mathison (Claire Danes) and Brett O'Keefe (Jake Weber) each have their own scores to settle with President Keene. The trailer shows O'Keefe, the show's resident conspiracy theorist, aiming a pistol at a poster of the president's face before pulling the trigger.
“The Founding Fathers foresaw the dark day when we would face a president like her,” O'Keefe says.
Homeland‘s producers have previously said that the writing team does not attempt to take sides in any political issues, thought memorably, its fifth season mirrored the real-life exploits of the terrorist group ISIS.
The show also added a female president-elect, Keene, ahead of its sixth season, though executive producer Lesli Linka Glatter previously said the character was not a reflection of then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
“Homeland tries not to do that. We try to pose questions, not posit answers,” showrunner Alex Gansa told Entertainment Weekly ahead of this show's fifth season in 2015.
Homeland Season 7 premieres February 11, 2018 on Showtime. The series has also been renewed for an eighth and final season.

Israel has a reputation for being home to some of the most capable offensive hacking firms on the planet. These shadowy companies sell wares to governments all over the world, and the market grows more and more competitive every year.
Case in point: The launch of a new Israeli firm called WiSpear, which is sparking a new rivalry in the lucrative business of Wi-Fi interception. This tech is used by police, intelligence and military agencies, which pay hackers to break into the networks of chosen targets. The company was first spotted by Intelligence Online.
WiSpear, launched in 2016 by a former commander in the Special Operations Unit of the Intelligence Corps in the Israeli Defense Force, sells the “SpearHead Wi-Fi Man-in-the-middle platform, ” promising to intercept a targeted Wi-Fi signal — and then steal data like social media passwords and other communications — at “the longest interception ranges” and with a design that can “integrate with any infection system.” The kilometers-long range is meant to be the system's defining feature.
It's a boastful set of claims but, with the pedigree WiSpear's founders possess, it's difficult to dismiss. The company was founded by Tal Dilian, a 25-year IDF veteran whose resume includes the 2009 launch of a company called Circles, a heavyweight in the real-time interception of data from 3G networks. Circles' tech worked in various ways, including exploiting vulnerabilities in Signalling System No. 7, a half-century old protocol behind much of the world's cell phone calls and text messages.
Israeli media reports that Circles is now owned by NSO Group, another top-tier Israeli hacking firm with connections to governments around the globe.
Dilian brought personnel to WiSpear from several of his previous ventures, including the company's chief financial officer, Itay Rudy, who worked under Dilian at the 3D printing and production firm Stratasys. WiSpear employs about 50 people with pedigrees that show the company is made of Israel's elite. The company's engineers and architects come from the IDF's top intelligence units, including Unit 8200, as well as firms like Verint, a billion-dollar giant in the “lawful interception” industry.
WiSpear is advertising at several trade industry shows in the coming months including ISS World, a spy-tech exhibition sometimes known as the Wiretapper's Ball, and Milipol, a French military-industry event. The company makes presentations touting the “best-in-class range performance with beamforming antenna technology.” The technology focuses a signal in a specific direction resulting in stronger signals and longer range. It's easy to see how that sales pitch could tempt governments.
WiSpear's long-range offerings face, among other potential rivals, the Israeli-made tool that was said to “reinvent Wi-Fi interception.” The “MABIT Scope” from the Israeli company Magen 100 (Mabit is Hebrew for watching, Magen is Hebrew for Shield). Magen, founded in 2011 by another cadre of Israeli intelligence veterans, fit a powerful Wi-Fi interception platform into a tiny backpack so the company's customers could be mobile as they scanned for smartphones, intercepted data and gained access to cloud-based accounts.
The appeal is that officers and agents can enter any area to collect key information on who is nearby — without any of the targets noticing at all.
Magen's website promises customers can “keep control over organized vandalism and illegal mass movements” as the company “monitors massive numbers of potential targets, showing you the global picture and emphasizing what interests you the most.”
With early Tuesday's abrupt evacuation of Zuccotti Park, the City of New York has managed—for the moment—to dislodge protesters from Wall Street. But it will be much harder to turn attention away from the financial excesses of the very rich—the problems that have given Occupy Wall Street such traction. Data on who is in the top 1 percent of earners further reinforces their point. Here's why.
Though the situation is often described as a problem of inequality, this is not quite the real concern. The issue is runaway incomes at the very top—people earning a million and a half dollars or more according to the most recent data. And much of that runaway income comes from financial investments, stock options, and other special financial benefits available to the exceptionally rich—much of which is taxed at very low capital gains rates. Meanwhile, there has been something closer to stagnation for almost everyone else—including even for many people in the top 20 percent of earners.
This may seem counterintuitive at first. After all, analysts have long painted a picture of growing inequality over the past few decades in which the top quintile's share of the national income has risen while the share of the other 80 percent has fallen. But almost all the gains for the top 20 percent was for the top 1 percent. And half of that is accounted for by a tiny group within the top percent—those earners in the top 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, for the four quintiles below the 80 percent level, the share of total income fell significantly. For those from the 80th to the 99th percentile, the share rose only slightly (a little more rapidly as you go higher up).
In other words, Occupy Wall Street's claim that “We are the 99 percent” is dead on right.
So it's worth knowing who is in that group of very rich with runaway incomes. Several news reports in recent weeks have cited a seminal 2010 study that uses IRS tax returns to find out who belongs to the top 0.1 percent. The authors deserve mention because they are often left out when their results are cited: Jon Bakija of Williams College, Adam Cole of the US Treasury, and Bradley Heim of Indiana University. This was not a Treasury study, however, but a private if scholarly one.
One key finding of the study is that three out of five of those in the top 0.1 percent of tax filers are executives or managers of financial and non-financial companies. Overall, more are from non-financial companies. Does this partly exonerate Wall Street, suggesting it is really Main Street where the problem lies?
In fact Bakija, Cole and Heim's analysis shows the opposite: it turns out that much of the increase in wealth of non-financial executives was also tied to the rise in stock prices. Keeping in mind that stocks options appear as wages in the data, it seems Wall Street itself was often a main source of income growth for “non-financial” managers as well. (Lawyers were another large category of tax payers in the top 0.1 percent, and though there is not direct data for this, one can fairly assume that many of those in corporate firms made a lot of money from the booming business on Wall Street.)
Next, think about how these executives managed their businesses. If they wanted a big pay check they had to orient their strategies to push up their stock prices—that is, often to appeal to the financial fads and fashions of the day. These strategies typically have included cutting labor costs and R&D in order to boost short-term profits. This delighted their advisers on the Street. Stock investors soon loved nothing better than consistent increases in quarterly profits, and not coincidentally, stock options accounted for an ever-growing proportion of executive pay over the past thirty years. We used to say once that Wall Street worked for business, but over the past thirty years business has come to work for Wall Street.
It is just as interesting to explore the factors that the authors found out probably did not cause the surge at the top. Economists typically posit sophisticated technologies (often related to digitalization) as a source of growing inequality: because these technologies require better educated and smarter workers, those who have mastered them are rewarded handsomely. But there was no surge at the very top in other nations like Japan or in Western Europe, which also adopted the same technologies.
Similarly, some have argued that globalization led to higher incomes at the top because skilled workers can sell themselves globally at ever higher salaries. Again, however, such skilled workers have not seen a surge at the very top in Europe or Japan.
One reason for the discrepancy between the US and other countries is that boards of directors in the US are especially willing to give their CEOs and other high level executives big raises and generous stock options. Lucian Bebchuk of Harvard has done a lot of research on this so-called “governance” issue. Meantime, as Bebchuk's work shows, shareholder influence over executive compensation is far too weak. And there is also the issue of culture itself. America—with its admiration for the self-made man—tolerates high remuneration for the men and women at the top and lower wages in the middle and the bottom. Culture likely matters.
But when we put it all together, compensation tied to stock options along with unusually high profits by financial firms, much of which was passed on to their executives, seems to be the overriding factor. This is probably now the main driver of what we call income inequality in America and what we should more accurately call runaway incomes at the very top.
One other major point requires some attention. This runaway at the top is different from other periods of great inequality, like the late 1800s. Back then, the Robber Barons may have kept money due to monopoly advantages and their power over workers. All the while they were adding to GDP by building oil and steel giants, railroads, and mass production companies from chewing gum to cars.
Today's people at the top exploit workers in somewhat different ways. There is constant pressure to keep wages down by CEOs in order to push up stock prices. This is the modern-day Robber Baron equivalent. Corporate takeover and leveraged buyouts have had the same effect: they build up cash flow by cutting expenses in order to pay off the debt they took on for their huge acquisitions. This is how Wall Street helps creates a culture in which it is considered okay for a company to fire workers while giving its CEO a giant raise.
But much else of what happens on Wall Street has nothing to do with the real economy, except to waste hundreds of billions of misdirected savings that are plowed back into useless speculation and casino-like gambling by the very rich on trades among themselves. As we have seen, it was this kind of reckless trading that fueled the credit crisis and the collapse of investment houses like Lehman in 2008. The way to deal with this is more serious regulation, including restrictions on the amount of leverage buyout artists and privatizers are allowed to take on. And since we are talking about outrageously high incomes at the very top, higher taxes on the highest earners also make very good sense because much of that income was not reflecting real contributions to the economy—in fact, it was arguably doing just the opposite.
So Occupy Wall Street is right: the financial firms are much to blame for runaway incomes at the top. Yet understanding the nature of inequality in America should place the focus where it truly belongs, on the other 99 percent. Wages have by and large stagnated in America. The real problem is that America's job machine is broken. Wall Street is partly but not entirely responsible for this. And policies to adjust this—persistent fiscal stimulus, substantial public investment in infrastructure and industry, a lower dollar to the yen, a higher minimum wage, and direct job creating programs like the New Deal's Works Progress Administration—are what's needed. If we do not begin to develop such policies, we will not have only the problem of runaway incomes for the few at the very top, but a large and growing part of the population—some of which is highly skilled and educated—that is cut off from the economy altogether.
Romney's Israel healthcare stunner The candidate appears to endorse a government-dominated universal care system
The notion that Mitt Romney would go out of his way to compliment Israel's government-dominated universal healthcare system seemed so insanely misbegotten an idea that I assumed the tweets I was reading Monday referring to his comments must have been referencing something he'd said when he was governor of Massachusetts, while pushing for his own universal healthcare plan. Ah, those clever Internet pranksters, I thought, pulling up old quotes to embarrass the presidential candidate while he was visiting Israel. With Romney, that's so easy to do it almost isn't fair.
But then I read in the Washington Post that he made those comments on Monday while talking to fundraisers.
Advertisement:
Do you realize what health care spending is as a percentage of the GDP in Israel? 8 percent. You spend 8 percent of GDP on health care. And you're a pretty healthy nation. We spend 18 percent of our GDP on health care. 10 percentage points more. That gap, that 10 percent cost, let me compare that with the size of our military. Our military budget is 4 percent. Our gap with Israel is 10 points of GDP. We have to find ways, not just to provide health care to more people, but to find ways to finally manage our health care costs.
Mitt's not wrong. He's just flabbergastingly off-message. The Post's Sarah Kliff does the heavy lifting:
Israel regulates its health care system aggressively, requiring all residents to carry insurance and capping revenue for various parts of the country's health care system. Israel created a national health care system in 1995, largely funded through payroll and general tax revenue. The government provides all citizens with health insurance: They get to pick from one of four competing, nonprofit plans. Those insurance plans have to accept all customers—including people with pre-existing conditions—and provide residents with a broad set of government-mandated benefits.
You read that right. Israel has a mandate and caps on coverage, which, if translated into current American politics, would represent to Republican voters something akin to the triumph of Lucifer over all that is right and holy.
As Kliff reports, according to at least one academic analysis, Israel has been able to keep healthcare costs from spiking precisely because of strong government involvement. It's the kind of thing civilized developed countries are prone to do, all over the world. It's a great model for the U.S. -- with only one drawback. It's exactly the kind of thing Mitt Romney has sworn his undying opposition to. So what could he possibly have been thinking?
Millions of dollars in maintenance work at the Detroit-Windsor tunnel will limit options for border crossers in the coming months.
The project comes after a recent inspection found the 86-year-old ceiling slab is showing signs of wear and tear from moisture, road salt and exhaust and needs to be replaced.
"We're working very closely with all of the venues both on the Windsor and Detroit sides as well as Transit Windsor," said tunnel company president Neal Belitsky. "We want to make this disruption as painless as possible."
The tunnel will be closed to traffic during weeknights, starting in November, for about seven months.
Closure times will be from 9 p.m. to 5:30 a.m., with four weekends when the tunnel will stay closed during that period.
Belitsky explained the tunnel company prides itself on limiting closures, but added "this is one we just found unavoidable."
(CBC File Photo)
The work was originally scheduled to begin last year, but bids came in "excessively high" so the project was split into three parts, which reduced the cost by about $10 million, according to the president. Replacing the ceiling will cost nearly $17 million U.S.
The tunnel won't appear radically different once the project is completed, but Belitsky said it may have a "fresh new look" compared to the decades-old ceiling travellers are used to.
"We're just trying to stay on top of it so we can serve the travelling public for at least another 86 years," he added.
When Bob told us we'd be building a new Remember The Milk from the ground up, he said we needed to go big. Ridiculously big. Bob thought we should listen closely to all the feedback and suggestions we'd received from you guys, our awesome users, and create the bestest tasks app the world has ever seen. And who are we to argue with a stuffed monkey?
So we coded, and coded… and coded some more. Crazy amounts of caffeine (and in Bob's case, bananas) were consumed. Finally, finally, we were done, and we're now super excited to be bringing you the new Remember The Milk featuring a whole set of shiny new apps.
Did someone say apps?
We sure did! In a moment of insanity, Bob decided we'd do everything at once. We have brand-new apps for the web, Mac desktop, iPhone, iPad, Android phones & tablets, BlackBerry 10, and Fire. (Don't worry, Windows and Linux apps coming soon!)
What's new in the apps?
The advantage of redesigning and rebuilding all of our apps from the ground up (did we mention our insanity?!) is that we were able to pack in a whole bunch of new features. Some of the highlights include:
Subtasks - break your tasks down into smaller, more manageable pieces
- break your tasks down into smaller, more manageable pieces Drag and drop reordering - rearrange your tasks in the order you plan to do them
- rearrange your tasks in the order you plan to do them Tag colors - make your lists both organized and colorful
- make your lists both organized and colorful All-new sharing - share your lists and give tasks to others to get things done faster
- share your lists and give tasks to others to get things done faster Notifications - get notified when someone shares a list or gives you a task
- get notified when someone shares a list or gives you a task Individual task reminders - set different reminders for each of your tasks
- set different reminders for each of your tasks Advanced sorting - sort and group your tasks however you like
- sort and group your tasks however you like to Start dates - track when it's time to start working on a task
- track when it's time to start working on a task Work offline - keep working on your tasks without an Internet connection
And that barely scratches the surface! Check out the What's New page for the full details.
We're updating Pro and our pricing
Way back in 2007, we introduced Pro accounts to give people a way to support the continued development of Remember The Milk. (We'd never intended to start Remember The Milk as a business, and were pouring all our own money and bananas into it!)
All of this only exists now thanks to the support of our awesome Pro users. Thanks to you, we were able to fund development of the new Remember The Milk (and most importantly, keep Bob well nourished with a constant supply of bananas). And with the new apps, we were able to develop a bunch of features that we're making exclusive to Pro (you did fund them, after all!).
Now, here's the thing. We've been offering Pro accounts at the same price since 2007 (okay, so nobody said we were business geniuses). We're at the point now where we need to increase our price so we can grow our team, continue developing sweet new stuff, and just generally keep this whole thing running (our hosting provider declined payment in bananas). So for new subscribers, Remember The Milk Pro is now $39.99 per year.
Already Pro? As a loyal Pro user (thank you!), you'll get all those new Pro features we mentioned, and your existing price is guaranteed through at least August 20, 2017 (that's the 10th anniversary of Pro).
Additional details about the changes are available in the help center.
How do I get the new apps?
To start using the new web app, just log in and you'll be invited to try the new app (if you're not ready to switch just yet, don't worry, you can keep using the old app). To download the new Mac app, head to the Apps page. The new mobile apps are now available on the various app stores, so will update if you already have them installed (give it a few hours if you don't see the update already). Otherwise, head to the Apps page for those, too!
Make sure to check out the What's New page for the rundown on all the new features you'll find.
We have people to thank!
Where do we begin? First up, we said this already, but thank you to everyone who's upgraded to Pro. Remember The Milk wouldn't exist without you.
We'd like to say a big thank you to the testers in our Pro Tester Program who helped us to test the new apps (in what may have been the world's longest beta test, *cough*). Many a bug was squished, and many a feature improved, thanks to your invaluable bug reports and feedback.
Another big thank you to the the translators who've helped us to make Remember The Milk available in their languages through our translation program. We were able to include support for a bunch of languages at launch, but will be busy adding even more with your translations.
And from me personally (I'm Emily, hi!), thank you to the rest of the Remember The Milk team, who've been working crazy hard on this project. Thanks to our awesome software engineers: Alonso and Andrew P. on web and desktop, Ab and Sami on mobile, plus (former) team member Kristian on backend. Thanks to the amazing Andrew C., who handles our support almost single–handedly. And thanks to my wonderful co-founder, Omar. Oh, and thanks to Bob, the best code monkey around! Look guys, we shipped!
In a recent eight-day span that roiled with emotion, San Jose State coach Dave Wojcik guided the Spartans to their first win over UNLV in two decades and their first victory over New Mexico, ever.
Related Articles Brandon Clarke hot as San Jose State downs San Diego State In between, Wojcik buried his father.
“It still hasn't sunk in,'' he said Tuesday, hours before the Spartans were scheduled to face San Diego State at the Event Center.
“He calls me every game day. I've saved every message.''
Wojcik, 48, paused as his voice broke.
“I'm waiting for him to call.”
With that, Wojcik composed himself and began to recount the exhilarating bookend victories and the intervening heartbreak.
It began Jan. 28, a Saturday afternoon. The Spartans had just rallied from 13 points down in the second half to beat UNLV for the first time since 1996. Wojcik spoke to his team, handled his postgame media responsibilities, then got a call from his sister, Denise.
Fred Wojcik, 79, was losing his fight with pneumonia. The family was preparing for last rites.
Dave and his wife, Heather, booked a red-eye from SFO to Pittsburgh. Before heading to the airport, they watched their son, Jake, play for Bellarmine College Prep against rival Archbishop Mitty.
The Wojciks landed in Pittsburgh on Sunday morning, then made the hour-long drive to Fred's home in Wheeling, West Virginia.
They were too late.
On Thursday morning, Fred was laid to rest.
On Friday, now sick with the flu, Wojcik joined his team in Albuquerque. He had exchanged text messages with the players during his five-day absence, but seeing them in person, on the eve of a visit to The Pit, was energizing.
“They have given me comfort,” he said. “They make me laugh. I feel good being around them.”
How the Spartans feel about Wojcik was on display Saturday afternoon. SJSU took command in the second half and powered to a 78-68 victory — the first for the Spartans over New Mexico in 13 attempts. (The Spartans ran their winning streak to three against San Diego State on Tuesday night.)
The roar in the visitor's lockerroom, Wojcik learned later, was the loudest anyone could remember.
“Things were very clear to me,” said Wojcik, who coached the game wearing his father's tie. “One of my assistants was yelling at the officials, ‘That's a walk!' I just told him to sit down.
“It's a weird calmness. I can't explain it.
“But I know he's with me.”
*** On the court, the Spartans are flourishing – at least in comparison to their historical standards.
Picked last in the Mountain West preseason poll, they're tied for sixth place and over .500 (12-10) this late in the season for the first time since 2011, when SJSU was a member of the WAC.
Their 76-71 victory over SDSU on Tuesday night extended the Spartans' first three-game winning streak in conference play since the university joined the Mountain West in 2013-14.
Given the remaining schedule and the efficient play of all-conference candidate Brandon Clarke (19 points per game), it's not a stretch to think SJSU could finish with eight or nine conference wins.
The Spartans won a total of five in Wojcik's first three seasons.
“It takes time, and we're a year older,'' he said. “They understand what they have to do.''
*** The Bay Area is two wins away from hosting one of the most anticipated games of the season.
If Saint Mary's and Gonzaga handle their weeknight business, the West Coast Conference powers will collide in Moraga on Saturday with the college basketball world watching.
The 20th-ranked Gaels (21-2) host floundering Portland on Thursday, while the top-ranked Zags (24-0) visit mildly dangerous Loyola Marymount.
Not since 1955 has a No. 1 team played in Moraga. Back then, it was Bill Russell and USF.
The festivities Saturday includes a visit from ESPN's Game Day.
*** Cal has won seven of its last eight games and quietly built a resume worthy of consideration for the NCAA tournament.
The Bears (17-6) have a chance to collect a first-class win this weekend when they visit Arizona (RPI: 12).
Equally important: Avoiding a bad loss Wednesday at Arizona State (RPI: 123).
The Sun Devils, who took Oregon to the wire last week, will use their perimeter-oriented attack to test Cal's defense, which ranks 14th nationally in adjusted efficiency.
“They can stretch you out,'' Bears coach Cuonzo Martin said. “When you have five guys who can make 3-point shots, five guys who can dribble-penetrate and make plays, it's extremely tough to defend.''
*** Her 1,000th career win secure, Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer can take clear aim at the queen: Pat Summitt.
Which got us thinking:
At her current pace, how long would it take VanDerveer to surpass the Tennessee legend, who has more wins (1,098) than any coach, man or woman, in major college history?
Stanford has averaged 28.6 wins over the past three seasons.
If VanDerveer hits that mark in 2016-17 and maintains the pace, she would overtake Summitt early in the 2020-21 season.

Steps to File a Patent Application in India:
i.) What is Patent and How to Perform Patent Prior Art Search in India?
I received many questions like this from new inventors. Inventors, Researchers or Students always remain curious about one question which is How to file a patent application in India?. They are always curious about their new inventions and they want to explain the whole invention in one step and they want to patent whole concept as soon as possible. “Patent Registration” is not a quick rich scheme.“Patent Registration” is a long process. It takes time. So, What is Patent? Do you know something about the patent? I think if you are reading this article you are a curious and intelligent person who has definitely some knowledge about on “How to file a Patent Application” in India.
let start from basic→
What is a Patent
The word patent is the most searchable queries among researchers, inventors, and business development community. A “patent” is an exclusive licence granted by Intellectual Property Offices to inventors, to exclude others from making, selling or using the invention. It has protection period of 20 years from the date of filing it. It means once a patent is granted, it will be valid for 20 years and after that, it will be available in “public domain”.
Patent Prior Art Search
Before doing Patent Prior Art Search, You must→
Create a document and clearly mention your→
Area of your invention.
The Sole purpose of your invention.
Advantages and Disadvantages of your invention.
B. “One Picture Worth Ten A Thousand Words“.Try to include as many drawings as possibles in your invention.
C. P.S.M (Patentable Subject Matter)
Section 3 of Indian Patent Act, 1970 describes “Invention not patentable”.You must make sure that your invention does not fall into this category. If you are not sure, contact Your Patent Attorney as soon as possible.

If you satisfy the points mentioned above, then you can perform patent prior art search→
Patent Prior Art Search is an important step before filing a patent in India. It will tell you whether your invention is already present or not. Please stop working on your invention, it is present on the web or elsewhere. Your invention will be judged by Patent Examiners on three basis→
Novelty Non- Obviousness Industrial Application and Enabling.
During Patent Prosecution, Your invention must follow these points. Else, Patent Examiners directly disqualify your invention. Therefore, It is suggested to perform patent prior art search by Patent Professionals and Qualified Attorneys.
After Patent Prior Search, a report will be generated. This report will decide whether to go ahead or not. If your invention is novel, non-obviousness, and industrial application and enabling then there is no need to worry.
ii.) Drafting a Patent
According to Indian Patent Office, There are two types of Patent specifications→
Provisional Patent Specifications. Complete Patent Specifications.
Provisional Patent Specifications is used to secure filing date else nothing. It is not necessary to include the claims in provisional patent specifications. It will give you 12 months of time to filing complete patent specifications. It is an optional step but a very important step. If you are dead sure about your invention and 100% ready then you can directly apply for Complete Patent Specification.
Complete Patent Specifications contains→
The content of the Invention. Claims. Drawings/Illustrations (if any)
Every complete specification must
(a) fully and particularly describe the invention and its operation or use and the method
by which it is to be performed;
(b) disclose the best method of performing the invention which is known to the applicant and to which he is entitled to claim protection;
and (c) end with a claim or claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection is claimed;
(d) be accompanied by an abstract to provide technical information on the invention:
iii) Publication of Application
According to Section 11A of Indian Patent Act, 1970 An Application is published after 18 months of the first filing date. You can also apply for early publication request, to publish the application before 18 months of the first filing date. There is a prescribed fee for that purpose.
iv) Request for Examination
A patent shall be examined when the applicant or any other interested person makes a request in the prescribed manner for such examination within the prescribed period. It is a very important and crucial step for your invention because your invention will be checked by patent examiners and it will decide whether your invention will be granted or rejected. It is also called patent prosecution. In this step, your invention will be judged on→
Novelty Non Obviousness Industrial Application and Enabling.
After that, First Examination Report will be created by Patent Examiners and submitted to the controller ( contains prior arts). One copy is also forwarded to the applicant for future references purposes.
V) Respond and Clearing Objections→
After Request For Examination, An inventor may receive some objections from controller general of patent, designs, and trademarks. It is required to clear these objections. In the first instance, it is not possible for the inventor to clear all objections. Therefore, It is suggested to use the services of Registered Patent Attorneys. After that, An inventor with his attorney or an inventor itself has to prove novelty in his/her invention. If controller satisfies with the inventor and found uniqueness, novelty and industrial application in the Patent, there are fair chances that inventor gets approval and invention may be granted.
vi) Grant of Invention
After clearing all objections, An inventor will receive Patent Grant and the invention will be published in the patent journal.
Now comes the important part:
There exist several terms which can reduce your filing costs such as Household incomes, Small Entity/ Large Entity etc. Also, Patent Prosecution is a crucial step in deciding whether you will get patent or not. Also, It is directly proportional to Patent Infringement Cases. You can do it alone but I would definitely suggest you use the services of Registered Patent Attorney in India.
Indian Patent Office is trying their best to make the patent filing process as user-friendly as possible. Just visit the official website of Controller General of Patent, Design and Trademark and follow their rules and regulations to file a Patent application in India.

Blaise Matuidi wished to join Juventus during the transfer window but insists he is happy at Paris Saint-Germain.
Matuidi was the subject of prolonged transfer speculation after his France international team-mate Paul Pogba left Juve to join Manchester United in a world-record move.
The 29-year-old midfielder told TF1's Telefoot programme that an offer was on the table from the Serie A champions and he was disappointed to see it rejected by PSG - echoing claims made by his agent Mino Raiola.
"There was a concrete demand. Yes, I wanted to go at the time," Matuidi said.
"The club decided otherwise and I had to accept it. There was a difficult period because I had a wish that has not been fulfilled."
Nevertheless, Matuidi is looking forward to the season ahead at the Parc des Princes under new boss Unai Emery.
"I'm not unhappy at PSG, far from it," he added. "There is a new coach and I know he trusts me."
Matuidi's international colleague Antoine Griezmann is unlikely to be joining him at PSG any time soon.
Griezmann claimed the Golden Boot as the star of Les Bleus' run to the final of Euro 2016 and he told L'Equipe he sought assurances his Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone was not going to take the vacancy now filled by Emery when Laurent Blanc left the French capital.
The 25-year-old signed a new contract in June, tying him to last season's Champions League finalists until 2021 and he is happy to remain under Simeone's guidance.
"For now, [PSG] is not my objective," he said.
"We talked about the coach, that he would perhaps go to Paris. I called before renewing, it was important to me.
"He confirmed that he would remain. I have many things to learn with him."
Coca-Cola stole Pepsi's thunder during Sunday night's broadcast of the Academy Awards on ABC.
While Pepsi replaced Coca-Cola as the exclusive soft-drink sponsor of the Oscars this year, it wound up facing the unexpected appearance of Coca-Cola logos on three pizza boxes delivered to the show.
The pizzas appeared as part of a bit by host Ellen DeGeneres, who joked about attendees' growing hunger during the lengthy ceremony and ultimately brought out three pizzas from Los-Angeles based pizzeria Big Mama's & Papa's.
As a Big Mama's delivery guy doled out slices to stars including Brad Pitt and Jared Leto, Coca-Cola's logo -- positioned on the side of the pizza boxes -- wound up with prime, free placement during one of the most expensive TV events of the year. A 30-second ad during the telecast was going for $1.9 million this year, according to media buyers.
While Coca-Cola marketing execs are probably wishing they could take credit for the unplanned placement, execs at ABC are most certainly wishing they'd foreseen it before allowing the boxes to appear on air. According to an executive close to the situation, PepsiCo, which ran ads during the telecast for several of its brands, has brought the situation to ABC's attention. The network is said to be investigating the incident.
An ABC spokeswoman declined to comment on the placement, as did a Pepsi spokeswoman.
"Big Mama's & Big Papa's Pizzeria is a longstanding Coca-Cola customer," a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said. "We were surprised and delighted to see them appear during last night's Academy Awards and think they did an outstanding job of bringing some extra fun and excitement to the show."
Coca-Cola decided to sit out of the awards show this year after being the exclusive non-alcoholic beverage sponsor since 2006. The sponsorship had served as one of the key marketing events for its Diet Coke brand.
Coca-Cola spent $41.5 million advertising during the Oscars between 2009 and 2013, according to Kantar Media.
This year PepsiCo took over the slot vacated by Coca-Cola, running a 60-second spot promoting its mini cans. The company also ran a 60-second ad for Lipton, in partnership with Unilever, as well as a 30-second ad for Aquafina Flavor Splash. Qua, its new premium water, was also distributed at the Oscars.
Ms. DeGeneres' stunt created significant buzz on social media.
Even without buying time during the Oscars and remaining relatively quiet during the awards, Coca-Cola managed to garner 4,978 mentions on social media related to the Oscars between midnight Friday and Monday morning, according to Salesforce. In comparison, Pepsi had 5,018 social mentions in conjunction with the Academy Awards during the same period.
The Oscars hit a 10-year high in viewership, watched by an average of 43 million people, up from 40.4 million in 2013.
ISIS identified thousands of churches in the United States as attack targets during the holiday season, according to a message posted late-night Wednesday in the group's "Secrets of Jihadis" social media group.
A user going by the name of "Abu Marya al-Iraqi" posted an Arabic-language message calling "for bloody celebrations in the Christian New Year" and announced the group's plans to utilize its network of lone wolf attackers to "turn the Christian New Year into a bloody horror movie, that will force [the infidels] to hide inside their burrows during their holidays and regret for the participation of their countries in the war against The Islamic State."
SEE ALSO: Berlin Attack Suspect Appears To Have Links To Tunisian Jihadi Group
"The lone wolves will turn the streets into rivers of blood, by ramming, exploding and poisoning," he wrote.
The message appeared in a pro-ISIS group on Telegram which provides manuals for the use and preparations of weapons and explosives for aspiring assailants.
In another group post, a member summoned "the sons of Islam" to target "churches, well-known hotels, crowded coffee shops, streets, markets and public places," and shared a list of church addresses in the United States, as well as in Canada, France and the Netherlands.
ISIS claimed responsibility for this week's Christmas market attack in Berlin that killed 12 and injured 48. The group said that the assailant was a "soldier of the Islamic State," who followed organizational orders "to target coalition countries."
The suspect was identified as Anis Amri, a Tunisian man in his 20s who reportedly had Salafi and jihadi connections in Tunisia and Germany.

Today you can see osu core functionality of the code, 70% is in the first month of the first to write almost no change, including the editor, song selection, play relevant and so on. Since ppy was caused by mistakes on the young architecture has been left inside.
What is it about the mistakes, editor of the core code, I never did not understand too, ppy said he is still able to understand, but he just can understand, change does not move. So encountered want to change the function editor, I always have to spend a lot of effort, carefully avoiding the possible impact on the normal use of the code, write new logic. More often, simply can not add things.
If you are a player, so the editor used to cool unhappy okay with you, then you definitely related to the stability of the game can not stay out of a game program on 60fps also felt card, which in itself is a problem, only 60Hz monitor refresh rate . To solve this problem, we need to plot the underlying logic and game logic, with two threads to run. This is the only possible reconstruction osu completed.
Besides dev team is how it works with the code to compile and release the power of one person only ppy, I wrote the code, he should look at every sentence. Prior to September 13, my code is in an independent branch, all I can quickly change the bug into submission, then ppy periodically merge once, then release. Prior to this, we work very well, but then, I have to follow the requirements of ppy, every alteration, to create a new branch, separate submission.
ppy has a habit is something of interest only, and will start a very good idea, and use it as motivation to do it without food or drink, and then osu is doing it, so that also the case modding v2 . The result is almost unanimously opposed BAT, because although BAT when nothing good reward, but at least do not waste their time with ppy justice guards play this game.
The results did not compromise the final ppy, modding v2 did not die, but ppy greater stir, he wanted to reconstruct the official website (ppy so it may be able to osu compared to code, can not endure the official website, the official website of the code does not tucao more) and then go together to make modding v2. The official website is currently ppy spend money on hiring people to write, slow progress.
So you see a shield SB later ppy function, in fact, that is lying to you, so that you shield on the surface, in fact, the shield SB ppy and background darkens when treated like cheating, documented. His bones are not recognized by this behavior, although it regardless, but maybe someday pp increase in the algorithm in addition to buckle off the SB and the like.
Speaking pp, will have to mention ppy players really do not know, one of these two years ppy do three big (stupid) thing is replaced by pp score, As this technology flow algorithm itself is good, tom We have to prove that, but nothing to do with ppy.
It scores event, I realized ppy just a developer, with the players not detached. So no matter how he was doing, related to the average player does not matter, he was just doing what he likes.
osu in the plug-in ppy eyes is two, one is able to detect, one is not detected. Can be detected, and will ban, but never once ppy ban, according to his logic, immediately ban hanging with plug to get into the war, he did not have the energy to play cat and mouse, so the delay ban hanging, probably open people are afk then hang it.
Finally had to mention cookies.
It was written a long one in loc posted to ppy to see, then ppy banned mania without sound. ppy think is my indulgence, and then very harsh to say: You do not want to engage in sound mania to roll out their own to do a Drop simulator, osu is sound, the sound is osu, which I absolutely do not compromise.
The second sound contradictory or mania, but this problem is not, as is ppy suddenly some of my key code comments, and then put someone in the forum did not sound feedback mania bug stickers tossed me, let me go and change.
Is followed two days later, ppy start deleting my other code, this time there is no reason to delete, and then my last as a shake M, say one thing: Please tell me the reason to remove it.
No answer.
Overall, players choose osu, really because there is no other game on the pc platform there are so many songs, the sound itself is a very small minority tour player, rhythm masters players millions of scale, it is almost full China is willing to play all audio and more than 50% of the number of trips. Number of core audio tour playing even 1% of this base not to.
* Local competitors, Amazon pose India threat
* EBay to speed investment in advertising, distribution
* Expects entry of PayPal to give it a boost
* Most India online merchandise buys are cash on delivery
By Nandita Bose
MUMBAI, April 27 (Reuters) - EBay Inc is stepping up investment in India to boost its share of a market dominated by domestic players such as Flipkart and fend off encroachment from arch-rival Amazon.com.
The e-commerce company dipped a toe into the Indian market seven years ago and stuck with a cautious approach, even as local upstarts made splashy grabs for business in a tiny but growing market.
“The talks of us having missed the bus are exaggerated,” Muralikrishnan B, country manager for Silicon Valley-based eBay told Reuters in an interview in Mumbai.
“Most of the new business models are just waiting to implode. We have chosen the cautious route, unlike a lot of Indian businesses who are blindly investing money without having an eye on sustainability or profitability,” he said.
The company hopes to bring its online payments business PayPal into India soon, which would help draw more online shoppers in a country where most online retail merchandise is sold on a cash-on-delivery basis.
EBay India, which started in 2005, clocks six transactions per minute, according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India. By comparison, fast-growing Flipkart, founded by two former Amazon employees in 2007, sells 20 items per minute.
Muralikrishnan, 36, joined eBay shortly after its entry into India.
He does not believe eBay has ceded an early mover advantage.
“We waited for the right moment because we didn't want to get caught up in the clutter. We were sure a lot of this new money will dry up and that has already started to happen.”
AMAZON LOOMS
India's $10 billion e-commerce market, dominated by online travel portals led by MakeMyTrip.com and Yatra.com, is seeing a flurry of promotional activity from startups that sell everything from electronics to clothes, shoes and fragrances.
Besides Flipkart, aggressive local players include HomeShop18, OLX, Quickr and Snapdeal.
Online shopping is still in its infancy, but it has struck a chord with time-constrained middle class shoppers in India, where rising incomes, aspirations to own brands, and an underdeveloped brick-and-mortar retail network are pushing many to shop from their homes.
Consulting firm Technopak expects the market to hit $70 billion by 2020.
EBay, which started in India selling flowers and chocolates as gift items to love-struck couples, now sells a variety of products including phones, mountain climbing gear and collectible stamps, either via auction or at fixed prices.
Muralikrishnan, who helped Sify Technologies set up shop in India before joining eBay, acknowledges there are worthy competitors. Its much-larger global rival, Amazon, recently entered India through the acquisition of a local price comparison platform called Junglee.com and is expected to launch an international online store.
“At some point of time Amazon will enter India and they are a credible threat to us,” he said.
EBay plans to invest millions of dollars in advertising in coming years, although Muralikrishnan did not give specifics.
It is also investing in strengthening its supply chain and distribution by tying up with courier services, and it hopes that PayPal will clear regulatory hurdles at the Reserve Bank of India soon.
“PayPal should enter India soon and then we will have a lot more people making payments online because that's a globally trusted name,” Muralikrishnan said.

RVA Krampusnacht, an event celebrating the mythical sidekick to St. Nicholas, returns to terrorize Carytown for a second year.
In a festive season chock-full of lighthearted characters like Santa, Frosty, and gingerbread men, one of the last things that comes to mind is a horned, devil-like creature as a symbol of the holidays.
Enter Krampus–and a walk in Carytown (this Saturday, December 6th) dedicated to the mythical beast RVA Krampusnacht.
— ∮∮∮ —
Hailing from the Alpine regions of Europe–countries like Austria, Germany, and Switzerland–from a time that at least pre-dates Christianity, Krampus's exact origins are difficult to trace.
“Lots of different cultures have their own version of him–he's basically a companion to St. Nicholas that punishes the bad children,” says Nicole Pisaniello, one of the walk's founding organizers. “You see versions of him in Europe and all of them have different looks.”
The first annual RVA Krampusnacht walk was held last year in Carytown, drawing over 40 participants donning monster-like outfits and masks who banged drums and made lots of noise to make their presence known.
Modeled after the RVA Zombie Walk, creatures of the night start off with a couple of cold ones at Portrait House before making their way down Cary Street to terrorize the masses before, you guessed it, heading back to Portrait House. Those in costume will be entitled to a number of drink specials.
Pisaniello got the idea for the zany event, which she started with cohort Parker Galore, after learning about Krampus in school. What she didn't realize, however, is that the creature was gaining popularity around the world outside of the textbooks.
“Some friends and I had heard about him in school briefly. Then later I started seeing Krampus [merchandise] online, and Krampus runs in other countries. I thought this could never happen in the U.S., but I decided to start my own [walk].
— ∮∮∮ —
Richmond's walk joins a growing number of cities in the U.S. hosting events. Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, and Philadelphia all have Krampus walks now. Pisaniello says several participants from the Philly event made the trek for RVA's inaugural walk last year.
Events in other countries are all over the board, says Pisaniello. “Some are more geared towards towards kids, others are just a pub crawl. We wanted to make [the event] true to Europe, but add our own artistic flair.”
To that point, and because of the popularity of last year's walk, Pisaniello and Galore are adding an art show the night before this year's event. 25 artists will gather and display their own unique interpretations of Krampus in a variety of media at 9WG Studios on W. Grace Street. The show will coincide with First Fridays.
Later in the month, Strangeways Brewing will host what Pisaniello calls a Krampus-themed “after, after party” on December 20th. Much like at Portrait House, Yuletide creatures will enjoy beer specials.
The 2014 RVA Krampusnacht walk kicks off at 5:30 PM on Saturday, December 6th at Portrait House in Carytown, where a costume contest and review of the rules (including confining the march to the sidewalk) will take place.

Image caption Sir Michael Wilshaw was asked to be chief inspector by Michael Gove
Teachers have passed a motion of no confidence in Education Secretary Michael Gove and the chief inspector of England's schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw.
Both are accused by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers of failing to improve education and not treating teachers or parents with respect.
The vote of no confidence was passed overwhelmingly by 300 delegates at the ATL's annual conference in Liverpool.
The government said it wanted a robust and rigorous education system.
It is understood to be first time the union has passed such a motion. But Mr Gove has angered teachers over the past year with changes to their pay and pensions and to the national curriculum and exams.
Jean Roberts, a teacher from inner London, told the conference that the pressure the two men were putting on staff was "horrendous" and that it was time to say: "Enough was enough.
"I have no confidence in Gove or Wilshaw - if any of us behaved towards pupils in this way, we would be sacked."
But one delegate, Jesse Ratcliff from Lincolnshire, urged caution, saying the unions should wait until the general election to voice their concerns.
'Blood brothers'
Speaking after the vote was passed, ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: "Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw are like blood brothers with a pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system and the teachers who work within it."
Dr Bousted said teachers felt demoralised and "do not see the reality of Mr Gove and Sir Michael's criticism and constant denigration in the work that they do."
"When you've tried your hardest and you keep being ignored then, in the end, you lose confidence and that's what conference has overwhelmingly said today."
Earlier, in her speech to conference, Dr Bousted launched a stinging attack on Mr Gove and his "wrong-headed" policies.
She said it was her duty to "castigate the man who is undermining everything we stand for".
In a survey of 996 members, 91% rated Mr Gove's overall performance as a D - or a fail for the purposes of school league tables.
The survey, which gauged ATL members' opinion of his policies since he took office in 2010, saw 70% give him a U for his policy decision allow schools to hire unqualified staff.
Rushing through legislation to allow schools to convert to academy status was graded a D or below by 91% of respondents.
And his vision for schools and school buildings was given a U by 48% of those surveyed.
'Champion'
A Department for Education spokesperson said: "For too long other countries have been outpacing us. We need to make sure we have an education system that is robust and rigorous, with exams and qualifications that match the world's best. This ambition is surely something the ATL should be supporting.
"Good teaching is critical to the success of our education system and we are making sure that it is properly recognised. We have put in place measures specifically to support teachers through increased funding for disadvantaged pupils and better opportunities for professional development.
"We have significantly reduced bureaucracy, given more autonomy to schools than ever before and we are making sure good teaching can be better recognised through the pay system."
An Ofsted spokesman said it was there to champion the right of all children and learners to a good education.
"Sir Michael has said from the outset any provision that is less than good is not acceptable. That's a tough message, especially for those schools and colleges that have been coasting. It's inevitable that when you challenge the system to do better, you will get some pushback.
"Ofsted, under a new regional structure that provides support as well as challenge for providers, is already promoting improvement as we work towards our ambition of ensuring a good education for every child. This is vital if England aspires to have a world-class education and skills system."
But if there is one thing that his team has learned from the Dutchman's arrival as a Formula 1 superstar, it is that his new-found status has not gone to his head.
So instead of moaning about what had happened, Verstappen shrugged his shoulders, realised that there are far more important things in life to get upset about it and got on with it.
For allied to his blistering speed on track, it is Verstappen's off-track attitude and enthusiasm that has won him great fans at Red Bull – and left the team confident that he and Daniel Ricciardo are well placed to not hit the self-destruct button if they find themselves fighting for the world champion hip in 2017.
Red Bull boss Christian Horner told Motorsport.com: "Max is very, very good - and he's so enthusiastic about everything. He's like a Labrador puppy that just wants to get into everything.
"Whether that's the history of the sport, whether that's what's going on in the junior formulas, or in karting, he loves his racing. He feels privileged to be a Formula 1 driver.
"There was an instance earlier in the year where flights from Montreal ended up getting double-booked and there were no business class seats available. So he ended up having to sit down by the toilets in economy.
"With others it would've been a major issue, but [with Max] it was no issue at all. We got: 'No problem, if that's what's available, I'll do it, I'll go down there'. And I think that's what's so refreshing about him. It's just enthusiasm for being a Formula 1 driver and doing what he does."
On-track tension
Of course, to suggest that Verstappen is so easy to deal with on all occasions would be wrong, because when the helmet is on, his determination and fighting spirit come out.
And there were times in 2016 when things did get difficult – like at the Hungarian Grand Prix when a pre-race agreement - that the Red Bull driver running second would drop back to hold the field up and help the lead car get away - fell by the wayside.
Instead, Verstappen stayed close to Ricciardo's gearbox and famously claimed on the team radio that he could not go any slower because he was already driving like his 'grandma'.
The incident caused tension at the time but overall Horner thinks that Verstappen and Ricciardo learned through last season how they need to behave.
["Hungary was] very minor," said Horner. "I mean, they work very well together. If you look, we switched the drivers around in Hockenheim. Everybody said that Max wasn't a team player, and that day demonstrated very clearly he was.
"And then of course the favour gets dealt back in Mexico. Just the way they've raced this year, whether it's the first turn at Hockenheim or many circuits that we've been to, they've been clean but fair.
"That's why I felt very comfortable letting the two of them race in Malaysia, even when it became for a grand prix victory after Lewis' engine issue. At no point has there been any concern about how those two race each other."
The bigger issue for Red Bull is dealing with the times when external factors – like the strategy call in Barcelona of the pit stop error in Monaco – ultimately hurt one driver more than the other.
"You know, issues happen," added Horner. "For me Barcelona was very straightforward, because that was just a straightforward strategy that on the day could go for you or against you. You know, Monaco hurt a lot more, it hurt the team just as much as it hurt Daniel.
"He could see that, he responded very positively to that. Very quickly after that... it didn't affect his season at all, I would say. He brushed himself down, got on with it and just drove some fantastic races."
Title rivals
But while Red Bull has come through a 2016 campaign without too many difficulties, things could become much harder if Verstappen and Ricciardo find themselves as rivals for a world championship.
F1 knows only too well – from the way that the Lewis Hamilton/Nico Rosberg relationship developed – how strong bonds can break apart totally when teammates become title contenders.
Horner is hopeful that the relationship between Ricciardo and Verstappen is strong enough to weather such circumstance – but he knows it would be foolish to expect things not to change.
When asked if it will be easy to keep things on an even keel if Ricciardo and Verstappen are gunning for the title, Horner said: "Probably not. But I think the biggest thing that exists between the two of them is a clear respect. They have great respect for each other.
"On top of that, they actually quite like each other. That's not a requirement from the team, it's just that they live in the same building in Monaco and Daniel has been a little bit like a big brother to Max, outside of the car.
"Inside the car, they're both as hungry as each other, they both want to win and they'll both race each other hard. But as long as it's hard but fair, that's fine by us."
Judging by the plane seat mix-up last year, though, Red Bull should not have too many worries about it having troublemakers inside its camp.
Already no stranger to the crossover game, Cartoon Network will once again bring some of its biggest properties together with Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers. The epic adventure will launch on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo 3DS this November.
Bringing together the likes of Adventure Time and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers is an original side-scrolling adventure from GameMill Entertainment (Goosebumps: The Game). Following an accidental tear in the universe caused by Uncle Grandpa, the CN Universe must come together to stop their collected enemies from taking over the world.
Featuring both solo and four-player co-op play, Battle Crashers pulls from the modern Cartoon Network line-up. Fans of the network can look forward to playing as Finn & Jake (Adventure Time), Uncle Grandpa (Uncle Grandpa), Steven (Steven Universe), Mordecai & Rigby (Regular Show), Clarence (Clarence) and Gumball (The Amazing World of Gumball). Single adventurers can even swap character mid-play, which will be necessary, as certain enemies can only be defeated by certain characters.
The world of Cartoon Network doesn't have the best track record when it comes to gaming. Whether it was the series of Adventure Time games, or the crossover Punch Time Explosion, developers have had a tough time properly adapting the material. And while we're still a few months off, Battle Crashers at least looks fun to play. I do wish the title pulled from the backlog of the network's shows, though. No Powerpuff Girls? Codename: Kids Next Door? Samurai Jack?
Will you be stepping in to the save the world in Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers later this year? Sound off below!
A collection of 76 businesses —including the likes of Apple, Google, and Microsoft —has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up a case that should clarify whether a law against workplace sex discrimination also covers a worker's sexual orientation.
The absence of a federal law explicitly preventing discrimination based on orientation is hampering recruitment in the 27 remaining states that haven't adopted their own protections, the companies argued according to Reuters. The test case in the matter would revolve around Jameka Evans, a woman who said she was harassed and forced to quit a job as a security guard at a Georgia hospital because she's lesbian.A decision on whether the Supreme Court will hear Evans's case is expected by the end of the year.In their brief, the companies said that divided opinions in lower courts are causing uncertainty for both companies and their workers. A federal appeals court dismissed Evans's case in March, ruling that her orientation wasn't covered under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.In April however a separate appeals court ruled in favor of another gay worker under Title VII, and in June, 50 of the companies involved in today's petition applied similar pressure on a Manhattan appeals court.Under President Donald Trump, who assumed office earlier this year, the Justice Department has reversed its position on gay rights, arguing that Congress didn't intend Title VII to protect LGBT individuals and that ruling otherwise would be a misinterpretation.Note: Due to the political nature of this story, comments have been disabled.
Israel has wasted no time accelerating Palestinian displacement during the first 10 days of 2017.
On Tuesday, Israel's justice minister Ayelet Shaked invoked biblical mythology to advocate for expanded Israeli Jewish colonization in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron.
“This place was bought by patriarch Abraham for its full price, the first deed of sale of its type in the world, so we have both historical and legal right to this place,” she said in a short videotaped speech during a visit to the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron.
She dismissed recent “legal arguments” that have been raised concerning settlement construction and expansion, especially from the United Nations.
Shaked also declared in Hebron that “the excuses” for freezing settlement construction are over as soon as US President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in, according to The Jerusalem Post.
“[We] need to build and build,” she proclaimed, adding that Israeli settlement expansion in East Jerusalem as well as the rest of the West Bank “is our right,” the Post reports.
Shaked, who has advocated for the genocide of Palestinians, denies that Israel is an occupier and has suggested that millions of Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank be pushed under Jordanian jurisdiction.
Destroying Palestinian homes
Meanwhile, about 80 miles north, a fleet of bulldozers destroyed 11 homes belonging to Palestinian citizens of Israel.
The demolitions led the mayor of Qalansawa, a city in present-day Israel, to announce his resignation in protest that he doesn't “have the power to change anything,” according to the Ma'an News Agency.
For decades, Israeli authorities “refused … to approve the city's master plan,” Ma'an adds. Its Palestinian residents attempted to stop the demolitions but were met with force by Israeli police.
A resident described the home demolitions as part of Israel's policies of “oppression, injustices, and displacement,” Ma'an reports.
Also on Tuesday in the West Bank, Israeli forces raided the town of al-Zawiya and delivered stop-construction and demolition notices to three Palestinian households and a printing company, according to Ma'an.
Demolition orders were also given to residents in the nearby village of Burqin on Sunday. Israeli settlements are rapidly expanding in the area.
In the first week of 2017, Israeli occupation authorities in Jerusalem demolished two homes belonging to Palestinians, part of a surge in demolitions that left more than 150 Palestinians homeless across the West Bank in a few days.
With translation by Dena Shunra. Editor's note: The number of homes demolished in Qalansawa was 11, not 10 as reported in a previous version of this post. The number has been corrected.
Marco Rubio sits on the intelligence committee in the Senate and he's concerned about the Wikileaks hacks. There is plenty of evidence to suggest Julian Assange is nothing but a tool for the Russians and Vladimir Putin. So Rubio is sending a warning to fellow Republicans not to cheer on Wikileaks:
“I will not discuss any issue that has become public solely on the basis of Wikileaks,” said Rubio, who sits on the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. “As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process and I will not indulge it.” Rubio's position is a clear break with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and some of his surrogates. Trump has repeatedly exploited the hack, blasting out though his Facebook and Twitter accounts negative Clinton headlines that have emerged and encouraging his supporters at rallies to look at the revelations themselves because, he said, the media aren't reporting on it enough.
The media should be reporting on it. It is news after all.
That said, Rubio is 100% right this is not something the GOP should be celebrating. If the Russians are behind this and can hack the DNC, they can likely hack the RNC. Things like this can come back to bite people and it could get ugly.

Dallas County will move some health and human services departments into a newly renovated facility about five miles north of downtown Adel.
The first offices at the Dallas County Human Services Campus, 25747 N Ave., opened last month on land that once housed the county's "poor farm."
The move is expected alleviate some overcrowding at existing offices in Adel.
Dallas County Supervisor Mark Hanson said the county has been dealing with space limitations for a number of years as the need for services has grown along with its population.
"It certainly helps," he said of the new county offices. "I think from an analysis of our current administrative needs and with some rearrangement of the buildings that we do own around the square, we might be OK for a period of time. But for me to predict what that period of time is is a little speculative."
Dallas County's population has doubled in the past 15 years. It had 40,000 residents in 2000 and grew to 66,000 residents by 2010. It's estimated that number is now at 80,000, Hanson said.
A space study analysis conducted 10 years ago revealed the county was under pressure to expand. But county voters didn't agree, and bond referendums to build a new law enforcement center, jail and administrative offices failed at the polls in 2013, 2014, and again in 2015.
The Department of Human Services moved into the new space in December. Community services, public health and environmental health offices will open there this month.
The facility also will include the county's emergency dispatch center.
"This building sits right in the middle of the county," Hanson said. "So if someone has a human service need, whether they're from West Des Moines or Dexter or Perry or Woodward or Granger, it's pretty much an equal distance for anybody to get to it."
Jerry Purdy, president of Design Alliance in Waukee, said the county spent $3.2 million to rehabilitate the building. It will spend another $375,000 to adapt the space for E-911 services, he said.
The project was paid for with a capital fund that was set aside to purchase land if the bond referendums were to pass.

Dallas County purchased 160 acres in 1869 to establish a "poor farm" to house people who were unable to care for themselves and who had no family willing to keep them. Residents were expected to work to help raise food and cover expenses.
Care started in 'poor farms'
Most Iowa counties had at least one such "poor farm," and over time most evolved into places for people with mental disabilities or illnesses.
The Dallas County farm eventually grew to 562 acres. The existing two-story brick building was constructed in the 1930s as part of the Depression-era Works Project Administration.
It operated as the Dallas County Hospital from 1934 to 1954 and later as the Dallas County Care Facility, before finally closing in 2014. The land was annexed into Adel in 2015.
Purdy said about two-thirds of the space underwent an "adaptive reuse" renovation. The historic character of the building's exterior was maintained, but crews gutted the interior to convert the old residential facility to an office environment, he said.
It is designed to house 70 employees, with room to grow.
Once all employees are settled, officials will again look at the county's space needs and begin to re-evaluate where their priorities are, Hanson said. The move to county-owned land will help in the short-term, but there are still concerns.
"The issue it doesn't help us with is our jail population," he said.
Inmate overcrowding is a regular issue at the 36-bed jail facility, according to the Dallas County Sheriff's Office. The jail's bed capacity will drop to 24 in 2018, when a state-issued variance expires.
The facility is separated into six-cell "pods." However, Hanson said, certain detainees can't be mixed, such as women, juveniles or extremely violent criminals. So if one woman is incarcerated, she will take up an entire pod, leaving five beds empty.
As a result, the county regularly transfers prisoners to the Story County and Polk County jails, which costs about $95 per prisoner each day.
Hanson said the county has yet to decide whether it will pursue another bond referendum to build a new jail, but officials are hopeful they can convince voters the need is real. In August, 52 percent of voters said yes to a $16.8 million jail facility, but the bond needed to reach a 60 percent threshold to pass.
"The principal piece is it's critical that we are planning for the future and we are not just designing a structure for the next 20 years," Hanson said. "We've added 40,000 people in 15 years. What happens if we add another 40,000 in the next 15 years?"

EXCLUSIVE: The follow-up to 2013's Sylvester Stallone-Arnold Schwarzenegger actioner Escape Plan is firming up its cast. Jaime King has signed to play a female lead, Abigail Ross, in prison-break sequel Escape Plan 2, and Power's Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson is reprising his role as Hush from the first film.
Sources also confirm to Deadline that ex-MMA fighter Dave Bautista, who plays Drax in the Guardians of the Galaxy films and upcoming Avengers: Infinity War, will co-star with Stallone in the ensemble sequel. Plot details are under wraps.
Steven C. Miller is directing Escape Plan 2, and Miles Chapman — who scripted the first film — is writing the script. It's a U.S.-China co-production with Emmett/Furla/Oasis and China's Leomus Pictures. Randall Emmett, George Furla, Mark Canton, Zack Schiller and Robbie Brenner are returning to produce. Ted Fox, Mark Stewart, Barry Brooker and Stan Wertlieb will executive produce along with the Fyzz Facility's Wayne Marc Godfrey and Robert Jones.
The original film topped out at $25.1M domestic but made more than four times that figure overseas — nearly $41M from China alone — for a $112.2M worldwide take.
King starred on the CW's Hart of Dixie for four seasons and most recently appeared in Bitch, which premiered at Sundance in January. Repped by Gersh, WME, Oren Segal and Myman Greenspan for legal, she next stars in the feature How to Cook Your Daughter.
Multiplatinum rapper Jackson co-stars in and exec produces the Starz drama Power and next co-stars in the feature Den of Thieves with Gerard Butler. He is other recent acting credits include Popstar: Never Stop Stopping, Southpaw and Spy. He is repped by APA and attorneys Eric Feig and Stephen J. Savva.
Welcome back to another Ingress teardown. 1.66.0 is currently on rollout to a Play Store near you. While this version has the official changelog of “Bug fixes & Mission Pause feature“. We know there is a lot more to be found hidden away in the APK. So lets dig into 1.66.0.
Obfuscation Woes
Like I mentioned in the 1.65.0 teardown, the obfuscation used the last two versions of Ingress has stepped up its game. Another version with 7000+ files changed. As you can imagine, this is nearly impossible to check for changes manually. My scripts for automating this process are learning slowly how to adapt to these changes, but till then it's quite possible that I will miss something.
New Item: EXTRA_SHIELD continued
This image (right) was included in 1.66.0. If you remember in the previous teardown, this image was a blank placeholder. This means development is continuing for this shield. If you focus you can see the little “AXA” logo in the base of shield in the image.
Crafty explorers after the last teardown found the location of this image, which matched exactly to the image in the APK. Below you can see a Google search returns information about this company. Immediately you can see the similarities between the logo of the company and the lettering on the shield.
There is no solid proof yet what this item is for or how it operates. Lots of speculation started last version over ideas, it will be interesting to find out the true purpose of this item once development of it finishes.
Ingress Wearables
It's safe to say, Ingress is coming to Wearables. This version included tons of changes which confirm my guesses. First off we have a new string
<string name="REENGAGEMENT_PORTAL_NEARBY">Ingress Portal Nearby. Hack it!</string>
This string along with the addition of RECIEVE_BOOT_COMPLETED (basically Ingress knows when your phone turns on), allows it to react and start what's called “Smart Notifications”. This fancy class has tons of criteria which help it know when/how to alert you. The below list is just a snippet of some of the configurations and tweaks that this Smart Notification has.

Basically, this thing is smart. Currently I see the feature is available for anyone whose Google account ends in @google.com. So Google employees are testing this out. Which probably explains why Anne (A Niantic employee, received a LG Watch)
To confirm. It looks like the only functionality so far of the Wear extension is to alert you when you are near to a portal.
Conclusion
This version was built on November 25, but found us on December 3rd. It seems there is a two week development cycle of feature development & bug fixes. Wearables and the new Shield item should be launching here shortly. Check back next time for another teardown, and hopefully we will have a slighter bigger teardown. This was a relatively small release in terms of content to explore.
Colorado Rockies' first baseman Todd Helton will miss the remainder of the 2012 season with a torn labrum in his right hip, according to Patrick Saunders of The Denver Post:
The Rockies' veteran first baseman will undergo arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip. The surgery, to be performed Friday, marks the end of Helton's 15th full season in the major leagues.
Helton, 38, has been hindered with a sore hip since an early June road trip and it impacted his ability to lift his leg, throwing off his timing, reports Saunders. He was hitting .238/.343/.400 on the season, down from a .320/.419/.545 career line.
Helton is the fourth player in as many days to be placed on the disabled list by the Rockies. Christian Freidrich, also out for the season, is on the DL with a lower back stress fracture, Michael Cuddyer is on the 15-day DL with a strained oblique, and recently-acquired Jonathan Sanchez was just placed on the DL with bicep tendinitis.
With Helton down, OF/1B Tyler Colvin and UTIL Matt McBride will likely be seeing the majority of the playing time at 1B, at least until Cuddyer returns from the DL. The roster moves have not yet been officially made, but this could open up a bench slot for somebody like Charlie Blackmon or Andrew Brown.
*** UPDATE ***
Per the Rockies' official Twitter feed, Chris Nelson will be activated from the 15-Day DL to take Helton's roster spot.

The Internet Movie Database -- a comprehensive resource for information about movies, television and celebrities -- is an indispensable research companion for decoding the Hollywood who's-who contained among contributors to Elizabeth Warren's United States Senate campaign. Recently released Federal Election Commission data show that Warren's California donors in 2011 ranged from household names like Danny DeVito and Vidal Sassoon to Mickey Madden, bassist of the pop-band Maroon 5.
Through Dec. 31, Warren's campaign received a total of $812,705 in itemized individual contributions from California residents -- a figure representing 9.2% of all the contributions to her campaign. Her home state of Massachusetts, where she is running against incumbent Sen. Scott Brown, accounted for $1,782,044, or 20% of her total receipts.
Donations were concentrated among residents of Los Angeles and San Francisco, which represent contributions totaling $146,305 and $139,886 respectively. Residents of Santa Monica contributed $43,640 and donors from Beverly Hills gave $31,275. Zip codes associated with Hollywood neighborhoods accounted for $18,245 in contributions.
DONOR DATABASE for a searchable, interactive database of Warren's California donors. Click here for a searchable, interactive database of Warren's California donors.
Notable names that pop up in Warren's campaign finance filings include Danny DeVito and wife Rhea Pearlman, who each gave $2,500. Others offering the maximum $2,500 in individual contributions allowable under federal law include Nancy Stephens of the horror movie “Halloween,” Dreamworks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, hair stylist Vidal Sassoon, and “The Simpsons” executive producer James L. Brooks.
Comedian Garry Shandling gave $1,000, while “Blazing Saddles” producer Michael Hertzberg added $700 to Warren's war chest.
Grateful Dead rhythm guitarist Bob Weir engaged in subtle mathematical humor with his contributions, which totaled $504. With separate payments of $9, $36, $54 and $108, each donation amount was itself a multiple of the number 9 -- a nod, perhaps, to the company that licenses The Grateful Dead's music (Ice Nine Publishing), the peak of the band's 1987 hit “Touch of Grey” on the Billboard charts (9), or lead guitarist Jerry Garcia's total number of fingers (also 9) and date of death (August 9, 1995).
Outside of the celebrity realm, Warren's popularity in academic circles may have also given her California fundraising a boost. Her campaign received a total of $40,002 in 2011 from individuals listing employment with the state's institutions of higher education, including Stanford University and the University of California system.
An additional $49,631 -- not counted in the statewide total listed above -- came from individuals who earmarked contributions to Warren's campaign through the Berkeley-based organization MoveOn.org.
According to an earlier analysis by The Republican, California has proven generous to both Warren and Sen. Scott Brown.
As of Sept. 30, 2011, California ranked second in a state-by-state list of total itemized individual contributions to Warren and fourth for Brown.
Through the end of 2011, Brown received a total of $214,620 from California residents. While not as stacked with celebrities as Warren's list of contributors, Brown's California donors include Lionsgate co-chairman Michael Burns. The entertainment company is known for feature films such as the Sylvester Stallone vehicle “The Expendables” and TV series such as “Weeds” and “Mad Men”.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Warren is due to visit the west coast again for a March 1 fundraiser. Tickets for a set of receptions hosted by entertainment industry lawyer Skip Brittenham and his wife, actress Heather Thomas range from $500 to $5,000.

The approach of Venezuela's left was quite different to that of Brazil's. Hugo Chávez's government got into a frontal conflict with the country's historical ruling classes early into his first presidential term. Things got nasty quickly. Boycotts, threats of disobedience, even a full-on military coup in 2002 backed by much of the opposition, told him and his people that nothing in the system could be trusted. So borrowing out ideas or negotiating moves with the elite was much more of a no-go, and opposing them was the first instinct whenever something came up.
Thus, when Chávez was challenged, say, by the management of the state-owned oil giant PDVSA firm, who refused to accept the new government's reforms in the summer of 2003, he didn't back down and appease them. Why would he do so when they were part of the same elite that had supported a coup against him just months ago?
PDVSA's top officials wanted to paralyze the country's most vital industry, and Venezuela massively depended on oil exports to afford to import the many goods that weren't locally produced. In the two months that their boycott lasted, the local currency plunged from 1,300 bolívares per US dollar to 1,900 each, making Venezuelans struggle to afford the basics, while the Central Bank was also bled of foreign bills amid the draught in exports and additional capital flight away from the country.
In that context, the prudent advice might have been: “hey, this is something too vital to mess up with, the economy needs the oil dollars to survive, we can't take these risks. Give some pro-market concessions to the PDVSA people, get their drills back to work and keep that hard foreign currency flowing, even if the government doesn't control as much of it as we would want.”
But that could never sit well with the Chavistas, who had seen enough of their country's elites to distrust the idea of making concessions at such time. So they went about things their way, challenging the oil managers first and then embarking in more unorthodox economic reforms as a shield against future attacks.
Eventually, the government got a big win, regaining control of the country's oil and putting some friendly directors and middle-managers in place of the previous hostile ones. While doing so, Chávez also A) fixed the country's exchange rate at 1,600 bolívares per dollar, cushioning the blow of the devaluation on Venezuelan's purchasing power, and B) established currency controls to stop the central bank from leaking so many of US dollars again, giving priority to purchase them to importers of basic goods over, say, citizens willing to go on holidays abroad or firms looking to store their savings in hard currency. This, he believed, would protect the country's foreign sector from being newly targetted.
A year later, PDVSA was up and running again, and after a devastating 2002 and 2003 in which the country's economic output had plunged by almost 9 and 8 percent respectively, the lost ground was recovered in a year, with GDP bouncing back by 18 percent in 2004.
Chávez's bold approach seemed to be paying off, and that was only the beginning. With international oil prices now skyrocketing, those incredible growth rates continued beyond that one-year bounce back: 10% in 2005 and 2006, 9% in 2007, 5% in 2008. Venezuela was having a boom of its own, all while distributing income and turning the country's political landscape on its head.
But the country was also planting the seeds of its own downfall during those times of success, even if they were different to Brazil's.
Hidden under the boom-time euphoria, a couple of basic dangers loomed. They were being brushed off by a combination of the US$100+ per oil barrel euphoria and a growing confidence in one simple idea that began to underlie almost every political debate: that questions to the government's economic policies ultimately amounted to a defence of the traditional powers that be.
Almost any economist, be it a leftist modern monetary theorist, a more centrist liberal or a hard-line right-wing Austrian, would spot trouble if presented with the scenario that began to grow in Venezuela after the foreign sector reforms of 2003: high inflation combined with a fixed exchange rate. Things get a bit technical here, but they can be understood in practical terms.
What happens is that, for anyone who holds part of the increasing amount of local currency (in this case, Venezuela's bolívares), everything else in the economy is getting nominally more expensive except the foreign bills that the Central Bank holds and sells at a fixed price. So buying that foreign currency (or any imported product) becomes the best business of the land, more so with every day that passes.
That leads to two dire consequences. First, local production becomes unsustainable, as it can't compete with increasingly cheap foreign imports. Next, the Central Bank runs out of foreign currency reserves, after giving them away at what in real, inflation-adjusted terms is an increasingly cheap price. That means that importing becomes less and less viable too, as the country has nothing to pay for it.
Those problems started becoming increasingly obvious in Venezuela, but the government's mindset — that criticism from trained economists amounted to attacks from enemies of the people's will — put it in denial about how this time it was mostly their own policies that were causing them.
So while the government mocked and demonized anyone pointing out that the policies were backfiring, officials tried alternative solutions. Businesses big and small were sanctioned or expensively nationalized after accusations of boycotting the economy. But they did no better post-nationalization, as the base problems kept worsening. More restrictions were placed on what could be imported, but even banning everything minus food and medicine proved insufficient to contain the demand for the few remaining Central Bank dollars. The military was put in charge of eliminating import black markets, but the profits were so good and the bribes so big that the generals ended up running them. In a nutshell, none of them really worked.
Today, Venezuela's economy is in ruins. Leaked government documents show GDP contracting by a staggering 19 percent last year, the third consecutive of recession. With local production collapsing, non-oil exports plunged from 35 to 10 percent, making the country even more dependant on the ups and downs of global crude markets than it already was. Local prices, meanwhile, are now in hyperinflation territory, rising by 800 percent last year, as various subsidies and stimulus programmes aimed at re-starting local production fail on their purpose and even backfire.
But hyperinflation, as crazy and damaging as it can be, is not even the country's main problem. The real enemy is scarcity. With local production collapsed, growing limits on imports and very little foreign currency in public or private hands to afford them anyway, hunger is growing widespread ( http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36913991 ). Crime and lootings are the order of the day, and only get worse with moves such as India-style overnight bans on cash (supposedly aimed at stopping flimsily-evidenced economic conspiracies), which have just added to the chaos.
All in all, a thoroughly depressing scenario. The challenge that Venezuela's left began against establishment economics ended up with its government harassing and threatening its own economic dissidents with jail ( http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2016/11/scholars-letter-of-support-for-ricardo-hausmann.html ) when it ran out of answers, and proving that economic failures outside of the mainstream are just as possible as inside it.
The much more resounding institutional abuses seen in the last few days, including a shortly-lived ruling which passed the lawmaking powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly to the government-friendly Supreme Tribunal, stem from the same economic impotence: that move came as the legislative branch refused to approve a proposal to sell oil rights to Russia, in a bid to raise some hard cash days before a looming foreign debt payment that would further deplete the country of dollars. With two and a half years still to go on Maduro's term, there's room for more authoritarian moves as long as the lack of economic answers continues to make the government focus on scapegoats.
But as we'll see in Part III, the consequences of Venezuela's crisis are also spreading beyond the country. After the collapse of 1990s neo-liberalism, the initial victories of chavismo helped push a continental turn to the left, up unto the inaugurations of hydrocarbons-nationalizing Evo Morales in Bolivia (2006) and foreign debt re-negotiator Rafael Correa in Ecuador (2007). A decade later, it is now the right-of-centre parties across Latin America that are gaining ground helped by variations of one simple slogan: “would you rather we became Venezuela?”
After nearly half a year of purges in Turkey's security forces after a failed military coup, the assassination of the Russian ambassador by a vetted Turkish police officer suggests that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan may face a resilient disloyalty problem.
Within hours of the assassination on Monday in Ankara, Turkish officials and the pro-government news media portrayed the gunman as a sleeper-agent disciple of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric who commands a following in the country and is accused of having directed the July 15 coup attempt to topple Mr. Erdoğan.
But it was also possible that the assassin, identified by the authorities as a 22-year-old riot police officer, Mevlut Mert Altintas, might have been a follower of the Nusra organization, linked to Al Qaeda, or of the Islamic State. Those extremist groups have used Turkey as a transit point into Syria and have battled Russia in the war there. The gunman shouted jihadist slogans invoking Syrian victims of Russian attacks as he fired bullets into the ambassador, Andrey G. Karlov, before being killed by fellow officers.
Political analysts said that regardless of Mr. Altintas's affiliation — with Gulenists, Islamists or some other group — the assassination at an art gallery in Turkey's capital betrayed a glaring unknown among forces that have pledged fealty to Mr. Erdoğan.
Research group SuperData has posted its report for March 2016, detailing what it claims were the top-grossing console, mobile, and PC digital games for the month, as well as overall consumer spend.
According to SuperData, worldwide digital game sales totaled $6.2 billion in March, up 5 percent compared to March 2015. In terms of growth by category, console came out on top, with revenue rising 23 percent, while sectors including mobile, free-to-play MMO, and PC also posted year-on-year growth.
Not all segments showed year-over-year growth, however, as social gaming fell 10 percent "as casual gamers increasingly shift to mobile devices."
Breaking things down by category, The Division came out on top in the digital console chart in terms of worldwide revenue across systems. Rounding out the the top five were Call of Duty: Black Ops III (February's No. 1), FIFA 16, Grand Theft Auto V, and Fallout 4.
In a blog post, SuperData said The Division pulled in $109 million from digital sales, which was $48 million more than Black Ops III. It was also mentioned that Black Ops III revenue fell 17 percent in March compared to February. The firm also pointed out that Madden NFL 16 dropped to 10th place overall, from a position in the top five in February, with revenue dipping 31 percent.
The Division also took the top spot on the PC digital game chart. League of Legends was the highest-earning game in the free-to-play MMO segment, which is how SuperData categorizes it. World of Warcraft topped the charts for pay-to-play MMOs, while DoubleDown Casino was the best performer in March in the social games category.

I deeply admire and respect Hillary Clinton. I think she is a great intellect with great fortitude. I think she was a strong secretary of state and a hardworking and effective senator. But I have come to a difficult realization: I don't want Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2016. I hope she does not run, she is not the right person for this moment.
Back in 2008, when all my peers were jumping on the Barack Obama bandwagon, I backed Clinton. The country was reeling from a disastrous eight years under President George W. Bush. We were desperate for competence after his incompetence; for respect for government after his disdain. We needed, in my view, a capable hand. She was well positioned to manage the end of two wars and to regain the international respect that had been lost during the Bush presidency. Clinton was a fantastic fit for that moment but that moment has passed.

Now, we are in a moment of existential crisis as a country. As we recover slowly from the Great Recession, we've discovered that we don't much like what we see. Only 28% of Americans say the country is headed in the right direction. Some 67% are dissatisfied with the wealth distribution in this country. And as corporate profits soar to new heights, working folks get the shaft sharing in virtually none of the gains of the recovery. In fact, 95% of the income gains over the recovery years have gone to the top 1% of income earners.
It is clear now that we have two economies: one for a thin slice of educated elite and one for everyone else. That is the moment we are in now. So I ask you, does Hillary Clinton sound to you like the right person for this moment?
In a time when corporations have hijacked our politics enabling them to reap all the profit without feeling any compunction to do right by their workers, is someone who sat on the rabidly anti-union board of Walmart for six years the right person to restore worker's rights?
In a time when we are still reeling from a global financial disaster brought on by foolhardy bank deregulation, is someone who recently took $400,000 to give two speeches at Goldman Sachs the person we need to wrest control of the asylum back from the banking inmates?
Keep in mind that at those paid speeches, Clinton wasn't giving tough love to these masters of the universe. On the contrary, she said that “the banker-bashing…was unproductive and indeed foolish.” Of course, it was her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who did much of the deregulating that got us into trouble including ending the Glass-Steagall prohibitions on mixing traditional banking with speculative investment banking.
More to the point though, in a time when we badly need to be inspired, rallied, and made to believe that America can once again be true to the American dream, we desperately need someone who is mission driven. We need someone who is clearly passionate, who is living and breathing and feeling in their bones the plight of the worker and the middle class, and who is unafraid to stand up to the Wall Street titans. That person is not Hillary Clinton. It is Elizabeth Warren.
Warren is, for good reason, the public official most feared by Wall Street. Since coming to the Senate, she has aggressively questioned banking regulators on why Wall Street banks were not being vigorously prosecuted. She's argued for expanding Social Security, for increasing the minimum wage, for using the infrastructure of the post office to provide basic banking services to the poor. Most recently, she pressed the Obama administration to nominate more judges who come from a background in public interest work rather than from big corporations. She's been fearless, determined, and relentlessly true to her roots as an advocate for the middle and working classes.
Some argue that Warren is too liberal to get elected. To me, this analysis is both shallow and cowardly. The causes that Warren champions from consumer protections to expanding Social Security to increasing the minimum wage are quite popular. I would be proud to back Warren in a battle over the real future of the middle class, the working class, and the American Dream. I would be delighted to have that argument any day. And if I believed that Clinton was ready for that fight, I'd be all in.
I just don't think that's where Clinton's heart is though. I think she is safe, careful, constantly evaluating her positions, drawn to the center, wherever that happens to be at the time. To be clear, I would back Clinton with all my heart against any Republican, and I would even support her over most Democrats. But she is much less than ideal.
Despite all her talents, Clinton is not the woman to address the deep inequality, corporate political capture, and middle class rot afflicting our country. So although I deeply admire and respect Secretary Clinton, I must say: Don't run Hillary. Don't run.
Hyperapp is a JavaScript library for building feature-rich web applications. It combines a pragmatic Elm-inspired approach to state management with a VDOM engine that supports keyed updates & lifecycle events — all without dependencies. Give or take a few bytes, the entire source code minified and gzipped sits at around 1 KB.
In this tutorial, I'll introduce you to Hyperapp and walk you through a few code examples to help you get started right away. I'll assume some familiarity with HTML and JavaScript, but previous experience with other frameworks is not required.
Hello World
We'll start with a simple demo that shows all the moving parts working together.
--ADVERTISEMENT--
You can try the code online too.
import { h, app } from "hyperapp" // @jsx h const state = { count: 0 } const actions = { down: () => state => ({ count: state.count - 1 }), up: () => state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }) } const view = (state, actions) => ( <div> <h1>{state.count}</h1> <button onclick={actions.down}>-</button> <button onclick={actions.up}>+</button> </div> ) app(state, actions, view, document.body)
This is more or less how every Hyperapp application looks like. A single state object, actions that populate the state and a view that translates state and actions into a user interface.
Inside the app function, we make a copy of your state and actions (it would be impolite to mutate objects we don't own) and pass them to the view. We also wrap your actions so they re-render the application every time the state changes.
app(state, actions, view, document.body)
The state is a plain JavaScript object that describes your application data model. It's also immutable. To change it you need to define actions and call them.
const state = { count: 0 }
Inside the view, you can display properties of the state, use it to determine what parts your UI should be shown or hidden, etc.
<h1>{state.count}</h1>
You can also attach actions to DOM events, or call actions within your own inlined event handlers.
<button onclick={actions.down}>-</button> <button onclick={actions.up}>+</button>
Actions don't mutate the state directly but return a new fragment of the state. If you try to mutate the state inside an action and then return it, the view will not be re-rendered as you might expect.
const actions = { down: () => state => ({ count: state.count - 1 }), up: () => state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }) }
The app call returns the actions object wired to the state-update view-render cycle. You also receive this object inside the view function and within actions. Exposing this object to the outside world is useful because it allows you to talk to your application from another program, framework or vanilla JavaScript.
const main = app(state, actions, view, document.body) setTimeout(main.up, 1000)
A note about JSX
I'll be using JSX throughout the rest of this document for familiarity, but you are not required to use JSX with Hyperapp. Alternatives include the built-in h function, @hyperapp/html, hyperx and t7.
Here is the same example from above using @hyperapp/html.
import { app } from "hyperapp" import { div, h1, button } from "@hyperapp/html" const state = { count: 0 } const actions = { down: () => state => ({ count: state.count - 1 }), up: () => state => ({ count: state.count + 1 }) } const view = (state, actions) => div([ h1(state.count), button({ onclick: actions.down }, "–"), button({ onclick: actions.up }, "+") ]) app(state, actions, view, document.body)
Virtual DOM
A virtual DOM is a description of what a DOM should look like, using a tree of nested JavaScript objects known as virtual nodes.
{ name: "div", props: { id: "app" }, children: [{ name: "h1", props: null, children: ["Hi."] }] }
The virtual DOM tree of your application is created from scratch on every render cycle. This means we call the view function every time the state changes and use the newly computed tree to update the actual DOM.
We try to do it in as few DOM operations as possible, by comparing the new virtual DOM against the previous one. This leads to high efficiency, since typically only a small percentage of nodes need to change, and changing real DOM nodes is costly compared to recalculating a virtual DOM.
To help you create virtual nodes in a more compact way, Hyperapp provides the h function.
import { h } from "hyperapp" const node = h( "div", { id: "app" }, [h("h1", null, "Hi.")] )
Another way to create virtual nodes is with JSX. JSX is a JavaScript language extension used to represent dynamic HTML.
import { h } from "hyperapp" const node = ( <div id="app"> <h1>Hi.</h1> </div> )
Browsers don't understand JSX, so we need to compile it into h function calls, hence the import h statement. Let's see how this process works using babel.
First, install dependencies:
npm i babel-cli babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx
Then create a .babelrc file:
{ "plugins": [ [ "transform-react-jsx", { "pragma": "h" } ] ] }
And compile the code from the command line:
npm run babel src/index.js > index.js
If you prefer not to use a build system, you can also load Hyperapp from a CDN like unpkg and it will be globally available through the window.hyperapp object.
Examples
Gif Search Box
In this example, I'll show you how to update the state asynchronously using the Giphy API to build a Gif search box
To produce side effects we call actions inside other actions, within a callback or when a promise is resolved.
Actions that return null , undefined or a Promise object don't trigger a view re-render. If an action returns a promise, we'll pass the promise to the caller allowing you to create async actions like in the following example.
Live Example
import { h, app } from "hyperapp" // @jsx h const GIPHY_API_KEY = "dc6zaTOxFJmzC" const state = { url: "", query: "", isFetching: false } const actions = { downloadGif: query => async (state, actions) => { actions.toggleFetching(true) actions.setUrl( await fetch( `//api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=${query}&api_key=${GIPHY_API_KEY}` ) .then(data => data.json()) .then(({ data }) => (data[0] ? data[0].images.original.url : "")) ) actions.toggleFetching(false) }, setUrl: url => ({ url }), setQuery: query => ({ query }), toggleFetching: isFetching => ({ isFetching }) } const view = (state, actions) => ( <div> <input type="text" placeholder="Type here..." autofocus onkeyup={({ target: { value } }) =/> { if (value !== state.query) { actions.setQuery(value) if (!state.isFetching) { actions.downloadGif(value) } } }} /> <div class="container"> <img src={state.url} style={{ display: state.isFetching || state.url === "" ? "none" : "block" }} /> </div> </div> ) app(state, actions, view, document.body)
The state stores a string for the Gif URL, the search query and a boolean flag to know when the browser is fetching a new Gif.
const state = { url: "", query: "", isFetching: false }
The isFetching flag is used to hide the Gif while the browser is busy. Without it, the last downloaded Gif would be shown as another one is requested.
<img src={state.url} style={{ display: state.isFetching || state.url === "" ? "none" : "block" }} />
The view consists of a text input and an img element to display the Gif.
To handle user input, the onkeyup event is used, but onkeydown or oninput would work as well.
On every keystroke actions.downloadGif is called and a new Gif is requested, but only if a fetch is not already pending and the text input is not empty.
if (value !== state.query) { actions.setQuery(value) if (!state.isFetching) { actions.downloadGif(value) } }
Inside actions.downloadGif we use the fetch API to request a Gif URL from Giphy.
When fetch is done, we receive the payload with the Gif information inside a promise.
actions.toggleFetching(true) actions.setUrl( await fetch( `//api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=${query}&api_key=${GIPHY_API_KEY}` ) .then(data => data.json()) .then(({ data }) => (data[0] ? data[0].images.original.url : "")) ) actions.toggleFetching(false)
Once the data has been received, actions.toggleFetching is called (which allows further fetch requests to be made) and the state is updated by passing the fetched Gif URL to actions.setUrl .
TweetBox Clone
In this example, I'll show you how to create custom components to organize your UI into reusable markup and build a simple TweetBox clone.
Live Example
import { h, app } from "hyperapp" // @jsx h const MAX_LENGTH = 140 const OFFSET = 10 const OverflowWidget = ({ text, offset, count }) => ( <div class="overflow"> <h1>Whoops! Too long.</h1> <p> ...{text.slice(0, offset)} <span class="overflow-text">{text.slice(count)}</span> </p> </div> ) const Tweetbox = ({ count, text, update }) => ( <div> <div class="container"> <ul class="flex-outer"> <li> <textarea placeholder="What's up?" value={text} oninput={update}></textarea> </li> <li class="flex-inner"> <span class={count > OFFSET ? "overflow-count" : "overflow-count-alert"} > {count} </span> <button onclick={() => alert(text)} disabled={count >= MAX_LENGTH || count < 0} > Tweet </button> </li> </ul> {count < 0 && ( <OverflowWidget text={text.slice(count - OFFSET)} offset={OFFSET} count={count} /> )} </div> </div> ) const state = { text: "", count: MAX_LENGTH } const view = (state, actions) => ( <tweetbox text={state.text} count={state.count} update={e => actions.update(e.target.value)} /> ) const actions = { update: text => state => ({ text, count: state.count + state.text.length - text.length }) } app(state, actions, view, document.body)
The state stores the text of the message and the number of remaining characters count , initialized to MAX_LENGTH .
const state = { text: "", count: MAX_LENGTH }
The view consists of our TweetBox component. We use the attributes/props, to pass down data into the widget.
const view = (state, actions) => ( </tweetbox><tweetbox text={state.text} count={state.count} update={e => actions.update(e.target.value)} /> )
When the user types in the input, we call actions.update() to update the current text and calculate the remaining characters.
update: text => state => ({ text, count: state.count + state.text.length - text.length })
The subtracting the length of the current text from the length of the previous text tells us how the number of remaining characters has changed. Hence the new count of remaining characters is the old count plus the aforementioned difference.
When the input is empty, this operation is equal to (MAX_LENGTH - text.length) .
When state.count becomes less than 0, we know that state.text must be longer than MAX_LENGTH , so we can disable the tweet button and display the OverflowWidget component.
<button onclick={() => alert(text)} disabled={count >= MAX_LENGTH || count < 0}> Tweet </button>
The tweet button is also disabled when state.count === MAX_LENGTH , because that means we have not entered any characters.
The OverflowWidget tag displays the unallowed part of the message and a few adjacent characters for context. The constant OFFSET tells us how many extra characters to slice off state.text .
<overflowwidget text={text.slice(count - OFFSET)} offset={OFFSET} count={count}></overflowwidget>
By passing OFFSET into OverflowWidget we are able to slice text further and apply an overflow-text class to the specific overflowed part.
<span class="overflow-text">{text.slice(count)}</span>
Comparison with React
At a conceptual level, Hyperapp and React have a lot in common. Both libraries use a virtual DOM, lifecycle events, and key-based reconciliation. Hyperapp looks and feels a lot like React and Redux, but with less boilerplate.
React popularized the idea of a view as a function of the state. Hyperapp takes this idea a step further with a built-in, Elm-inspired state management solution.
Hyperapp rejects the idea of local component state relying only on pure functional components. This translates to high reusability, cheap memoization, and simple testing.
Final Thoughts
Because Hyperapp is so tiny, it is faster to transfer over the network and faster to parse than virtually any alternative out there. This means fewer concepts to learn, fewer bugs and more framework stability.
I've never been a fan of big frameworks. Not because they aren't great, but because I want to write my own JavaScript, not the JavaScript a framework wants me to use. The meat of it is I want transferable skills. I want to grow skills in JavaScript, not skills into frameworks.

Well, it's pretty obviously where the name comes from. Skylight, garden, Skylight Gardens. This here is the overdue Gardens on Glendon space that was actually estimated to open last April. After many months and much interior work, new owner Peter Clinco (a long-time friend and lawyer to the Lewis Family who operated Gardens on Glendon) is readying his restaurant for a soft run later this month with an official reveal in early March. Architect and interior designer Osvaldo Maiozzi of Rivera conceived the bright, rustic look, meanwhile the Italian focused menu comes by way of Raffaele Favuzzi (Pane e Vino, Angelini Osteria) and pastry chef Sebastian Gonzales of El Bulli, Spain.

Brenda Lieberman can sum up the 2016 Calgary Underground Film Festival pretty easily.
"We've totally nailed it this year."
The festival director says the diversity of genres, films and storylines has made this year's incarnation of the festival the best one yet.
That's not without a lot of effort. Lieberman said the festival team worked hard to secure some big films for the week.
"The films that are looking to showcase in the festival circuit are looking to get picked up for distribution and sales deals," she explained. "We have to prove ourselves both in our style of programming and how long we've been around in the festival circuit."
CUFF 2016 kicks off Monday and runs until April 17 at the Globe Cinema.
Here are some of Liberman's picks:
Hunt for the Wilderpeople is the opening film for CUFF. (CUFF)
Hunt for the Wilderpeople
Director: Taika Waititi
​Screening: April 11, 7 p.m.
This film tells the story of a young city kid who gets placed in a foster home on a remote farm.

This documentary looks back at the art installation and performance village that attracted 10,000 viewers in nine days in April 2013.
MTA customers now have new options for travel in Brooklyn and Queens, including a faster way to get to LaGuardia Airport. This new and extended service was first announced last summer as part of a $29 million investment by the MTA.
“We always want to better serve our customers by strengthening service whenever we have sustainable resources to do so,” said MTA Chairman and CEO Thomas F. Prendergast. “These new and extended routes will go a long way towards providing better service to our customers in Brooklyn and Queens and provide a new, fast and reliable bus connection between LaGuardia Airport and regional transit hubs.”
Q70/Q33
Starting this Sunday, September 8, a new Q70 Limited route will operate as a full-time limited-stop service providing a fast and reliable bus connection between LaGuardia Airport and regional transit hubs. The new Q70 Limited will serve the Woodside-61st Street Long Island Rail Road and subway station (both local and weekday peak direction express service) and the station at the Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Av hub, then travel non-stop to and from LaGuardia Airport via the limited-access Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Grand Central Parkway.
At the airport, the Q70 Limited will serve all central airport terminals currently served by the Q33 (Terminals B, C and D). The Q70 will not serve the remote and lightly-used Marine Air Terminal (Terminal A); passengers may continue to access this terminal to/from Jackson Heights via the Q47. The Q70 Limited is designed to provide an attractive service for airport passengers and workers by reducing travel time by more than 40% from Jackson Heights (compared with the current Q33), as well as improved reliability and new regional connections via the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) and train at Woodside.
Travel times between Midtown Manhattan and LaGuardia Airport connecting at Woodside or Jackson Heights are estimated to be as fast as 35 minutes. Direct connections with the LIRR at Woodside will facilitate regional transit access to LaGuardia Airport from the eight LIRR branches that currently have no access, making travel to the airport more convenient for Long Island Rail Road customers.
The Q70 Limited will operate 24 hours, seven days a week, the same hours of service as the current Q33. Initially, the Q70 Limited will run on a 12-minute frequency during most of the day, with 15-minute and 20-minute headways during early morning and late evening periods; and 30 minute headways during overnight periods.
As a result of the changes to the Q70, the Q33 will terminate outside LaGuardia Airport on 95th Street at Ditmars Boulevard. This shortens the Q33 and will avoid redundant service between LaGuardia Airport and Jackson Heights. It will also allow the Q33 to better serve its primary ridership in the local communities to and from the intermodal hub at Roosevelt Avenue-74th Street, separate local community ridership from airport ridership and the associated luggage, and improve reliability on the Q33 by providing scheduled recovery time at both ends of the route.
The amended Q33 will retain its current hours of service operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There will be minor modifications in the Q33 frequency during the AM peak and weekend periods based on changes in ridership levels due to the re-distribution of most of the current LaGuardia Airport customers to the new Q70 Limited.
The MTA has been working closely with the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) to analyze transit access alternatives to LaGuardia Airport.
B67
Effective Monday, September 9, the B67 will extend to the Brooklyn Navy Yard from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays. The northern terminal for the B67 trips that do not serve the Navy Yard will be located on Sands Street, on the far side of Jay Street. This extension of the B67 will serve the Brooklyn Tech Triangle which is a growing cluster of interconnected economic activity in Downtown Brooklyn, DUMBO, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. In addition this extension will serve Vinegar Hill and the York St station. These areas expect to add significantly more jobs and residents in the next few years, and this new investment will improve previously limited transportation options.
The route will operate along its current route from Kensington to Downtown Brooklyn, travel along Jay Street, Front Street, Bridge Street, York Street, Gold Street, Sands Street, through the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and exit onto Kent Avenue to continue to its northern terminal on Division Street at Wythe Avenue, where it will connect with the B62. Southbound, the route will travel along Wythe Avenue, Clymer Street, through the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Sands Street, Gold Street, York Street, Pearl Street, Sands Street, and Jay Street to resume the existing route to Kensington.
B32
Effective Sunday, September 8, the MTA will also implement a new B32 bus route between the Williamsburg Bridge Plaza and the Court Square-23 St station in Long Island City.

How many attempts by your government to keep you quiet through harassment, arrests and trials would it take before you stopped trying to hold them to account? For Rafael Marques, nothing the Angolan government has thrown at him will keep him silent. Rafael goes on trial this month for writing a book accusing army generals in Angola of alleged human rights abuses. We are calling on the US State Department to raise our free speech concerns for Rafael and all citizens to the Angola government.
Rafael goes on trial March 24th on politically motivated charges relating to a book he wrote in 2011 alleging human rights violations in the diamond industry by generals in the Angolan military and private businesses. He also filed a criminal complaint against those alleged to be responsible for the abuses described in his book, seeking justice for the victims of the country's diamond industry. As a result, Mr. Marques was formally charged with criminal defamation; prosecuted for simply exercising his right to freedom of expression.
In 2000, Rafael was convicted of defaming Angola's president, Eduardo dos Santos, and sentenced to six months in prison. However, the UN Human Rights Committee found the conviction violated his free speech and ordered such malicious prosecutions to cease. Clearly Angola did not heed this memo. Angola's vaguely written press law, written in 2006, limits the ability of journalists to publically criticize the government, and a number of journalists have been prosecuted for criminal defamation by senior government officials.
The US government says it holds the right to free speech and freedom of expression to be sacred, fundamental and universal. Let's push them to match action to rhetoric. We are calling on the State Department to let the Angola government know of our concerns about Rafael's rights being violated, both in regard to free speech and a fair trial. Help us make this happen by raising your voice to make sure we can ALL raise our voices.
After the last couple of articles about Ken Fontenot's Honda CB160 and Suzuki GT500, I was thinking about how much money it takes to build a bike that looks really good. A comment on Ken's Honda build represents one point of view, downplaying the results a bit because he figured there must have been a lot of money thrown at the bike. While I'm sure that bike wasn't cheap, a lot of what went into it was time, labor and attention to detail, something anyone can afford, but few are willing to pay.
On the heels of that comment, I was reading through the latest Motorcyclist magazine and came across an article on the Dirtbag Challenge (Geez guys, you couldn't come up with a better name?), an annual affair in San Francisco where builders must construct a bike for under $1000 in one month, no Harleys allowed. The bike needs to be safe, and last year, a 120 mile ride was a necessary hurdle for all contestants.
As you might expect, beauty is not a primary focus, but scrounging for parts and mechanical innovation are highly prized. The competitors are getting much better and some builders, like Julian Farnam, have been turning out high quality bikes for years.
Farnam's bike for the Dirtbag Challenge was a 1977 Yamaha RD400 which, including everything, came in at the princely sum of $937. Craigslist, a 2 stroke forum and his own leftover parts bin contributed what he needed, his design studio was the BART where he sketched out the details during his commute to work and the welding was done in his driveway which doubled as a fabrication shop.
Yes, money makes it easier, but builds like this one show you don't need as much cash as some might think, what you really need to do is reach deep into your pocket and pull out a lot of the right attitude and just get to work. I call that affordable.

Having overcome the seemingly impossible task of alchemizing the Coen brothers' 1996 masterpiece Fargo into two seasons of Emmy-winning, critically beloved TV gold, showrunner Noah Hawley is now pushing himself to complete even more feats of entertainment industry wizardry. As per a press release put out today by FX, Hawley has signed on as a producer for two more projects for the network in addition to his ongoing work on Fargo and his upcoming duties as a writer and producer on the network's Kurt Vonnegut adaptation Cat's Cradle and X-Men spinoff, Legion.
First up on Hawley's increasingly packed plate: Hellhound On His Trail, about the 65-day manhunt for James Earl Ray, the man who shot Martin Luther King, Jr. Based on a book by Hampton Sides, the series will follow a team of investigators on their continent-spanning quest to find the man who shot the civil rights leader outside a motel in Memphis, Tennessee in April of 1968. The series is being written by True Blood's Alex Woo, who will hopefully be able to resist the urge to slip some werepanthers into the story of the hunt for the convicted assassin.

On a less serious note, Hawley will also be producing The Hot Rock, an adaptation of Donald Westlake's Dortmunder novels, whose bumbling, crime-prone protagonists wouldn't be out of place hanging out in Minnesota with D-grade criminals like Fargo's Lester Nygaard or Ed Blumquist. First adapted for the screen by Robert Redford back in 1972, the TV adaptation is being written by Entourage writing team Matt Wolpert and Ben Nedivi, who've also both penned episodes of Fargo (which will hopefully alleviate fears that any of Westlake's classic characters will now find themselves describing non-currency entities as “money,” or associate themselves with anyone called Turtle).
All told, this is pretty ambitious slate of shows, so it'll be interesting to see how Hawley—whose pre-Fargo production experience is mostly limited to a stint on Bones and work at the helm of short-lived stuff like ABC's My Generation—will handle the additional pressures. FX president John Landgraf seems confident, in any case, reaffirming the network's commitment to working with Hawley, as he apparently works to single-handedly push FX to the brink of Landgraf's famous concept of “peak TV”.
A Filipino-American has been appointed as assistant press secretary of the White House under the newly installed Trump administration.
According to a report by Asian Journal, 23-year-old Ninio Fetalvo was tapped by Press Secretary Sean Spicer to come on board following Donald Trump's inauguration last Jan. 20. Fetalvo was part of the presidential inaugural committee that handled media affairs for Trump's inauguration.

Fetalvo, who majored in political communication at George Washington University, also served as Asian Pacific American press secretary and spokesman and Florida communications director for the Republican National Committee (RNC).
“It's truly a very humbling experience. It's a real honor to work on behalf of our country and the American people. I'm really excited to see what President Trump and Vice President [Mike] Pence accomplish to truly make the country great again,” Fetalvo was quoted as saying by Asian Journal.
“Being at this position in the White House really excites me to just be able to help communicate and emphasize the policies that [are] really going to make our community better and more prosperous,” Fetalvo said.
Fetalvo was born to Filipino parents who emigrated from Bicol. JE/rga

The tribes that kept KXL out of their territories are understandably pleased by the momentary suspension of that pipeline project. This editorial does not diminish their ‘victory', but rather tempers the euphoria around the KXL rejection with a dose of reality. To not do so only set up the naive to be hoodwinked again.
Delaying KXL does not halt the annihilation of the Athabaskan peoples, whose territory is a carcinogenic wasteland. It merely means the Tar Sands toxic bitumen will make its way to the Gulf of Mexico by other routes, which incidentally are already operating, making KXL redundant for now–the real reason for the celebrated KXL ‘rejection'.
The suspension of KXL coincides with a glut of oil reaching the Gulf, necessitating development of greater storage and terminal capacity there. That, and plans to develop pipeline and oil train terminal infrastructure on the West Coast of Canada and the Northwest US, is why KXL rejection no longer matters to oil exporters, but made Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, and their Tar Sands pals a bundle.
The reason for the glut goes back to 2012, when Obama opened up millions of acres for gas and oil in 23 states, ushering in the fracking boom that brought us chemical injection aquifer contamination and ‘bomb trains' owned by Obama's friend Warren Buffett since 2009, when he purchased Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad (BNSF) for $34 billion–the same year Tides Foundation funded 350. In 2010, 350 launched the campaign to reject KXL; by 2014, crude-via-rail in the US soared to 500 thousand carloads per year, up from 5 thousand in 2008, with trains exploding across Canada and the US.
As noted in Railroading Racism, BNSF is embroiled in conflict with the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, that opposes Buffett's bomb trains and associated oil train terminals in Washington state. BNSF has responded by helping fund Tea Party-led political action committees deeply involved in promoting anti-Indian white supremacy.
To refresh readers' memories, the KXL ‘grassroots' hoax was funded in large part by Buffett, through his pet NGO, 350. Funds laundered through Buffett's foundation NOVO and the Tides Foundation — a money laundry used by Tar Sands investors and other elites to control NGOs — helped finance the KXL NGO charade, thus eclipsing any discussion about shutting down the Tar Sands, and making possible the explosive growth of bomb trains and other pipelines.
As noted at Wrong Kind of Green, There Was Nothing Key About Keystone XL — Except Diverting Our Attention For More Dirty Profit. As noted at The Real News Network, Regardless of Keystone XL, Tar Sands Oil Will Still Flow to the Gulf.
The fact it took two years for TRNN to catch up with WKOG, where the 350/Warren Buffett KXL charade was first exposed, suggests it is as much a cynical opportunist as Hillary. In fact, Skirting the Real News is something I wrote about a year ago, when TRNN was unquestioningly promoting Klein, 350, and their many hoaxes.
Interestingly, the TRNN cover-up of the Klein/Buffett charade remains unexposed by this so-called Real News Network. As I observed in April, Distorting Reality is what liberal gatekeepers like TRNN do. That's why two-thirds of its ongoing operating revenue comes from the rich, i.e. Ford Foundation. Ford, Rockefeller, and Buffett own the entire ‘grassroots' KXL NGO milieu.
Sometimes when you are playing online, you might find that you are often disconnected from your online gaming sessions on the PS4 and PS3, or that your ping is too high. One way to try and solve this issue is to change your NAT type (network address translation) for the PS4 or PS3, and you should notice a significant improvement in your online gaming.

How to change your NAT Type
Here's a quick guide to get you on your way with changing the NAT type:
The first thing you'll need to do is to find out how to connect to your router, this address is normally something like 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.1.254. Once you type that into your web browser, you will have to put in your administrator login and password and get into the router. This information should be either on the bottom of the router itself, or in the manual that came with the router. Enable UPnP function on your router. There are two ways to do this now. Either set a static IP address for you console, and assign it to the DMZ (demilitarized zone, not recommended), or open up some ports and assign it to the console. The rest of this guide will advise you which ports need opening up. DO NOT SET DMZ FOR THE ENTIRE ROUTER AS THIS IS EXTREMELY INSECURE. The way you forward ports will vary from router to router, but you should be able to find a guide on Google for your specific router. You need to open up the following ports in both directions TCP & UDP: 80
443
465
983
3478-3480
3658
5223
6000-7000
9293
10070-10080 These are all ports that you need to open for Sony's first party systems (such as voice chat, PSN, remote play etc.) and games, and should, once rebooting your console, allow you to have NAT Type 2, which is what you're looking for. Other games will have additional ports that need to be forwarded, but these are based on each game. The developers will probably post details whenever a game is released on their community forums.
Opening these ports will also change the NAT Type for the PlayStation Vita also.
WASHINGTON -- For Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Donald Trump's insults aimed at minorities and others the intemperate business tycoon considers enemies amount to a message problem.
McConnell recently said that he voted against archconservative Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election because Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act.
Goldwater's racism cost the GOP the support of African-American voters for generations, and McConnell said that it could happen again with Trump and Latino voters.
But asked Tuesday how he squared that with still supporting Trump, McConnell merely repeated his warning.
"I was worried that we would do to the Latino vote what was done to the African-American vote by defining our party in such a way that we could not reach out to what has become the nation's largest minority group," McConnell told reporters on Capitol Hill. "So I am worried about that. I said that last week and I say it again today."
Still, pressed on whether he was worried about what Trump could do to McConnell and the GOP's broader agenda, the majority leader declined to disavow Trump. Instead, he offered Trump advice.
"There are a lot of issues that we ought to be talking about, our nominee ought to be talking about," McConnell said, pointing to the economy and Obamacare.
"My advice to our nominee would be to start talking about the issues that the American people care about, and to start doing it now," McConnell said. "In addition to that, it's time to quit attacking various people that you competed with, or various minority groups in the country, and get on message."
If Trump does that, McConnell thinks the nation will overlook Trump's ongoing offenses against Americans who are not like him.
"This election is eminently winnable. The American people at their core do not want four more years like the last eight," McConnell said. "So I hope that's what he will do. We're all anxious to hear what he may say next."
McConnell again declined to characterize Trump's remarks about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel as racist. Trump has repeatedly said that Curiel, who is presiding over a Trump University case, is biased against him because of the judge's Mexican heritage.
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) scolded GOP leaders for their response to Trump's comments, and appeared to reference McConnell's remarks moments earlier.
"So, let me get this straight: the Republican leader said that racism was the lesser of two evils," Reid said.
Liberal leader Justin Trudeau has strongly defended his party's decision to vote in favour of controversial anti-terror legislation, saying he was acting in the “best interests” of Canadians even though the bill has flaws.
Moreover, Trudeau insisted Wednesday that if the Liberals win the Oct. 19 election, they will move quickly to introduce legislation to amend Bill C-51 so that it better protects the individual rights of Canadians.
Trudeau made the comments in a wide-ranging interview on Parliament Hill with the Ottawa Citizen and the National Post.
Asked if he has regrets about his position, Trudeau indicated he thinks he made the right move — despite criticism from his political rivals — and that Canadians will ultimately decide on the matter.
“We took a position based on what is in the best interests of Canadians. And ultimately this is a line of work in which you have to know that if you're making decisions and taking positions that are reasonable and that flow from your values and your fundamental principles, then people will make informed choices.”
In recent weeks, the Liberals have watched their first-place standing in public opinion polls slip to third — behind Tom Mulcair's New Democrats and Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservatives.
Pollsters credit part of Mulcair's surge to the political dynamics associated with Bill C-51, which the governing Conservatives introduced in the months following the attack by a gunman on Parliament Hill.
The bill gives powers to Canadian spies to disrupt suspected threats to the nation, in many instances without the need for judicial warrants. It also lowers the legal threshold required for police to detain suspected extremists without charge and to impose conditions on their release. Critics have complained about the lack of oversight on the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and police, and that Canadians' Charter rights could be in jeopardy.
While the NDP categorically opposed the bill and voted against it, the Liberals voted for the bill and promised to fix its shortcomings if they are elected to govern.
That has led some voters to apparently shift their allegiances from the Liberals to the NDP, say pollsters. Mulcair has also been highly critical of Trudeau's stance. One of Trudeau's own candidates in Nova Scotia has even stepped aside because he disagrees with his party's stance.
But Trudeau indicated he believes he took the right decision.
“One of the things we said from the very beginning, in the aftermath of the shooting on Parliament Hill and throughout the debate, is we don't want to see this issue more politicized than it has to be.
“Now, perhaps that was overly idealistic in an election year, but at the same time I know that Canadians want both their physical security protected and their rights upheld.
“What came before us is a bill that brought in definite measures to immediately increase the security of Canadians but didn't do enough to uphold and protect people's rights.
“And we made a call that we were going to support the bill, push to have it amended, but try and remove it from political debate.”
Trudeau said that, by comparison, the Conservatives and NDP are on either side of the spectrum and are “blasting away” at the Liberals.
“Mr. Harper is playing up fear of terrorists. Mr. Mulcair is playing up fear for Islamic communities, for environmentalists, for First Nations. But they're both playing politics of fear.”
Trudeau said his approach to politics is rooted in the conviction that he will not “play the politics of fear.”
“You won't hear me say, ‘Mr. Mulcair, who voted against physical security, doesn't care about Canadians' safety.' And yes, it's a position that is more easily attacked than the other positions are. But it's also the right position. Because we are in a position of saying, ‘We will do both. We will protect Canadians' physical security and uphold their rights and freedoms by demonstrating that we will repeal the parts that are problematic with C-51.”
Trudeau said a Liberal government would bring in “proper oversight” and a clause that requires review of the law every three years.
He said that he will move “as quickly as possible” to bring in amendments, because he knows Canadians want both “physical protection” and protection of rights.
“As the party of the Charter, as the party that has always understood how important people's rights and freedoms are, as someone who has demonstrated it on a wide range of issues throughout my leadership, we will move on it very quickly.”

Statement by Fair Vote Canada re: third party status in by-elections
Fair Vote Canada is a multi-partisan citizen campaign for proportional representation. We support candidates and parties who support the principle of proportional representation and who will commit to moving the issue forward. We believe all citizens deserve to be fairly represented in the House of Commons. The skewed results that most often lead to false majority governments undermine the integrity and accountability of our country at a time when we should be celebrating our respect for diversity and equality.
In the lead-up to the 2015 election, Fair Vote Canada showcased parties and candidates who agreed with the principle of proportional representation, namely that the share of votes obtained by each party should be accurately represented in the number of MPs elected by each. Three parties promised to “Make Every Vote Count” if elected. “Make Every Vote Count” is Fair Vote Canada's tagline slogan for what happens under a proportional representation system, Fair Vote Canada showcased the positions of different parties and of candidates who spoke up for proportional representation on its website.
After winning a false majority under the existing First-past-the-post system, the Liberal government has now reneged on their promise to Make Every Vote count despite the unquestionable support received in favour of the proportional representation option. Failing to provide an evidence-based explanation for dropping their campaign promise, the Liberals have come across as dishonest brokers on the issue of electoral reform.
In light of this development, Fair Vote Canada and its supporters have agreed to implement a strategic campaign with the goal of sending a strong message to Justin Trudeau, who claimed the broken decision was his choice to make. Fair Vote Canada registered as a third party so we would be able to campaign with a strategic message aimed at Justin Trudeau in the five by-elections on April 3rd.
Fair Vote Canada campaigned hardest in Ottawa-Vanier, where 73 volunteers signed up to help and distributed 15,000 leaflets and postcards in almost 100 polling areas (half the total in the riding).
FVC's local Chapter discussed the plan with the two parties that we endorsed (the NDP and the Green Party), but we ran our own strategy and campaign. We did accept publicly available maps offered to us by the NDP office, and this will be reflected in our report to Elections Canada. Accepting these maps was in no way an attempt to deceive, mislead, or defraud others. Nor was it an attempt to circumventing maximum amounts allowed for election expenses. Fair Vote Canada remains below the spending limits in all the by-election ridings.
Fair Vote Canada's approach in these by-elections has been to ask citizens to vote for candidates who have shown consistent support for electoral reform. It is our opinion that both the Green Party and NDP have been consistent in their desire to modernize Canada's voting system to reflect and respect voter intentions.
We would dearly welcome an opportunity to support the Liberals again, should they choose to return to an evidence-based process on electoral reform and follow through with their commitment to Make Every Vote Count.
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO's pledge to send more troops to Afghanistan still falls short of commitments, U.S. commanders said on Thursday, concerned that fewer reinforcements could threaten the already precarious security situation in the country.

At a meeting of NATO defence ministers, commanders said that nearly three months after President Donald Trump announced his “South Asia strategy,” the promised troop numbers do expand the NATO training presence but not by as much as hoped.
“We have made it very clear to the allies that we really need their help in filling these billets that we have identified,” said General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan and head of the NATO training mission.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said this week that NATO allies and the United States would split the burden of providing some 3,000 more troops, an increase that would take NATO's training mission to about 16,000 troops.
Two diplomats said that at this stage, the United States is likely to provide 2,800 troops, while non-U.S. NATO allies and partners will send an additional 700 troops, potentially making up a 3,500-strong personnel increase.
Germany, one of the main European troop contributors, said it was not increasing its contribution for next year, which German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen defended.
“The commitments received so far are sufficient. We will not reach the total troop level, but to a high degree,” von der Leyen told reporters.
European NATO's focus has partly shifted to deterring Russia on its eastern flank, diplomats said, after Moscow's seizure of Crimea in 2014 helped take East-West ties to post-Cold War lows.
Nicholson said he was concerned that the United States would be put in a position where it would have to fill the shortfall.
“Right now my plan is to have U.S. forces focused on the things that only U.S. forces can do, so I would not like to have to divert U.S. forces to do things that allies can perform,” Nicholson said.
LOW CAPABILITY, HIGH RISK
Security in Afghanistan has deteriorated in recent months, 16 years after the United States invaded to topple the Islamist Taliban government that gave al Qaeda the sanctuary where it plotted the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
“We fought ... at the lowest year level of capability that we have ever had in the 16 years. So it was the lowest level of capability and the highest level of risk we have faced in this time,” Nicholson said.
Before the ministers' meeting, U.S. officials said about 80 percent of the troop commitments had been met by the allies.
U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that about two dozen countries had signalled their intent to increase their troop commitment, but declined to publicly give concrete numbers.
“I don't give the enemy information they can use to their advantage,” he told a news conference.
Officials said there was a 10 percent shortfall even after the NATO meeting.
According to U.S. estimates, about 43 percent of Afghanistan's districts are either under Taliban control or being contested.
One area in particular where there was a need for NATO troops was in training Afghan soldiers and police officers.
A total of 2,531 Afghan security forces were killed and 4,238 wounded in the first four months of the year, according to figures in a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR), a U.S. Congressional watchdog.

“I am most concerned about police training in particular, because we are trying as part of this four-year road map to get the police out of paramilitary policing and (into) civilian policing,” Nicholson said.
The four-star general said that while contractors could potentially be used to fill the gaps, ideally it would be filled by NATO members. A recent report published by SIGAR said that tens of billions of dollars could be wasted unless changes are made in the training of Afghan security forces.
U.S. intelligence agencies have assessed that the conditions in Afghanistan will almost certainly deteriorate through next year, even with a modest increase in military assistance from America and its allies.
Tony Friese awoke to a knock on his door on an early Saturday morning five years ago and found police officers standing on his doorstep.
“They said there'd been an accident and that she'd lost her life. I identified her by her purse,” Friese said about his 20-year-old stepdaughter, Jessie Rind, who was killed in a drunk driving accident that March morning.
Along with the oil boom, the number of impaired drivers is steadily rising in the Odessa area.
As of Thursday, the Odessa Police Department reported making 384 arrests for driving while intoxicated this year, a 40 percent increase from 2008.
In 2013, there were 462 DWI arrests made by OPD, 405 arrests in 2012 and 340 arrests in 2011, according to police records.
Kevin Lee Hulsey, 39, of Midland, was sentenced 10 years in jail after pleading guilty to an intoxication manslaughter charge in connection with the accident that killed Rind.
“A 10 year sentence was not at all justice, and for Hulsey to walk out of prison after only five years is absurd,” Jessie's 30-year-old brother Clay wrote on “Justice for Jessie,” a Facebook page the family made in her honor and to raise awareness on drunk driving. “Everyone who has been affected by a drunk driving incident knows the pain and suffering we have gone (through) and are still going through.”
Hulsey had a 0.23 blood alcohol level, three times the legal limit, at the time of the collision, according to a Midland Reporter-Telegram story.
During the trial, a Midland Police Department lieutenant told court officers Hulsey was allegedly at Jaguars Gold Club in Odessa and received e-mails shortly before midnight asking if he wanted to come and get high, according to information gathered from Hulsey's cell phone, the MRT reported.
When he was taken into custody, Hulsey became aggressive and swore at hospital staff and officers, court documents stated.
Rind, a nursing student at Midland College, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident at about 4:30 a.m. after Hulsey hit her vehicle head-on when he drove his black, Ford trucks the wrong way on Loop 250 and tried to exit off the northbound entrance.
Rind was coming home from dropping off a coworker from Buffalo Wild Wings where they worked earlier that evening, her family said. Rind was six months away from her 21st birthday.
Friese recalled opening the door to the officers and vividly remembered their exchange. They questioned him if he had a daughter, and after giving both of his daughters' names including Rind's, the officers asked him to sit down. Two hours earlier, Friese heard sirens near his neighborhood and later learned they came from the vehicles that responded to his stepdaughter's crash.
“You take Jessie's grave – that's where we get to visit her for Christmas, for her birthday, for Valentine's Day, for Easter,” Friese said.
“That's all we have - we have nothing,” Rind's mother, Rhonda Friese, said. “I will never be a grandmother from her, I will never be the mother of the bride, I will never fill in the blank. He still has his life, he can go to college. My daughter doesn't have that.”
The Frieses said they became frustrated to see Ruben Hernandez, an Odessa man, sentenced to eight years after pleading guilty to an intoxication manslaughter charge Wednesday.
“Those kinds of sentences are showing that it's meaningless for the person that they killed,” Tony Friese said.
The family asks through the page for the public's support in sending letters or emails to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice as Hulsey is set to appear for parole near the end of this year.
“This is the year that he gets his first parole. We want to speak out to people to write letters,” Tony Friese said.
Jason Clark, Texas Department of Criminal Justice public information officer, said the board of pardons and paroles goes through the information relayed by the public, family members, community members and even the offender's family.
“They're the ones that do the process of going through the submission and being the ones that they vote,” Clark said.
Clark said the board looks at several factors during a parole hearing, including information submitted by the victim's family members, the seriousness of the offense, the adjustment of attitude within jail of the offender and whether a weapon, drugs or alcohol were involved, among other factors, Clark said.
The Frieses said they believe more drunk driving accidents would be prevented if law enforcement had a heavy presence near bars after closing, especially on the weekends.
OPD officer Paul Hurley says in the two years he's started patrolling, the number of DWI arrests he's made has increased.
“I know what I'm looking for. There are certain indicators that could lead to driving while intoxicated,” Hurley said. “Being behind a vehicle and they're not maintaining a single mark lane, you conduct a traffic stop and they stop very abruptly after traveling for a little while, if they have a heavy odor of alcohol on their breath, they're slurring their speech or they're having trouble finding their driver's license – those are certain indicators that you look for.”
Hurley said DWI arrests “seem to happen every day of the week,” and despite the majority of the offenders being young males, all kinds of community members commit drunk driving.
“Driving while intoxicated is something everyone no matter race, age, religion, anything, there's no certain age limit or anything else,” Hurley said. “It's all encompassing – the majority of the time, yes it'll be young men, but you'll find 60-year-old grandma and she'll be driving intoxicated. It was 11 o'clock in the morning when that happened.”
Motorists can be arrested with a class B misdemeanor for a DWI if the breathalyzer registers .08 blood alcohol level or higher.
An officer can arrest a driver even if the BAC reads lower than .08 if there are other indicators the motorist is driving impaired, Hurley said.
“As long as you have facts that make that officer believe that he's intoxicated to the degree that his mental and physical abilities are impaired, then yes, he is intoxicated,” Hurley said. “But the Intoxilyzer is a good indicator where that person's at.”
If officers believe the driver is intoxicated on something other than alcohol, the motorist could be asked to provide a blood sample.
If the motorist refuses, the officers will then check if there are any prior convictions. For two previous convictions, the motorist can be charged with a felony “even if they refuse you do an automatic blood draw,” Hurley said.
If a motorist has at least one prior conviction or have a BAC count of .15 or higher, they can be charged with a class A misdemeanor.
“If they're driving while intoxicated and they have an open container in the vehicle, that actually holds them longer inside the jail,” Hurley said.
If a child under the age of 15 years is in the vehicle or a crash results in injury to another person due to the driver being intoxicated, it becomes an automatic state jail felony, police officials said.
“Ultimately the goal of finding someone who's intoxicated is not necessarily just to punish them, we're concerned about their safety because honestly it's one of the most selfish decisions you can make,” Hurley said. “It's not only putting themselves in danger, it's putting everyone else on the road and even houses because we have cars that go into houses. It'll surprise you every day.”
Rind's family and police officials urged the public to know their limits and to have a designated driver if they plan on drinking to prevent any harm.
“The main message we want to send and remind the public if they see or suspect there is an intoxicated driver on the road, then we encourage them to report it immediately,” OPD spokesman Cpl. Steve LeSueur said. “It can potentially save that person's life as well as several others.”
(CN) – The FBI paid $900,000 to access the iPhone of one of the shooters in the 2015 San Bernardino shooting that left 14 people dead, a Democratic senator has revealed.
The agency announced it had unlocked the iPhone of San Bernardino gunman Syed Farook in March 2016, after a protracted battle with Apple over consumer privacy. The matter eventually wound up in court.
In a statement at the time, U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said the FBI sought an order compelling Apple to unlock the phone to “fulfill a solemn commitment” to the victims of the shooting. Apple maintained the request was wrong, and that creating a backdoor into the phone would have “set a dangerous precedent.”
Sen. Dianne Feinstein revealed the cost of breaking into the phone during questioning FBI Director James Comey at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing Wednesday.
The FBI for the last year has treated that figure as classified information and has not disclosed it. The bureau has also protected the identity of the vendor.
The Associated Press and other news organizations last year filed a public records lawsuit for that information.

Mary Robinson once said that the smell of fresh paint would be one of the abiding memories of her presidency. Local communities always seemed to have redecorated whatever centre or school she was visiting just before the presidential party arrived.
The smell of fresh paint, the dust of freshly laid pavements and the colours of newly planted flower beds were prominent in New Ross this week as the local authorities and shop owners busily readied the quayside for the arrival of American political royalty next weekend. The Kennedy clan is coming to town.
Four miles out the road at Dunganstown the scene was also one of dust and fresh paint as the Office of Public Works put the finishing touches to the new visitor centre at the Kennedy Homestead. Curator and Kennedy cousin Patrick Grennan and heritage interpretive designer Jack Harrison have assembled a fascinating exhibition of photographs, observations and memorabilia capturing the extraordinary journey that is the Kennedy story.
The visitor centre will be officially opened by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Caroline Kennedy next Saturday afternoon. Later that evening they will also light an eternal flame to emigrants beside the Dunbrody famine ship at New Ross. It's all part of a series of Kennedy homecoming events as three dozen American-based Kennedys join with their local cousins, the townspeople and thousands of expected visitors to mark the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy's visit as president in 1963.
Dramatic works
Among the dramatic works which the town council has undertaken at the quayside in New Ross has been the erection of a statute in bronze by Ann Meldon Hugh replicating a US presidential podium at the spot where John F Kennedy spoke. Having checked the online footage of the speech and even the minutes of the relevant town council meeting from 1963 the town manager, Eamonn Hore, was able to pinpoint to within a metre the precise spot as appropriate location for the podium statute. The bronze podium has already become an attraction in its own right. On recent bright summer evenings one could see people standing behind it and having their presidential speech-making pose captured on smartphone cameras.
The full text of John F Kennedy's speech in 1963 has been engraved on the podium top. The most striking thing about the speech is how short it was: it runs to just over 300 words. It lasted just three minutes. A press copy of the New Ross remarks preserved in the Kennedy Library in Boston shows four closely typed paragraphs which take up about two-thirds of a single A4 page. Footage of the speech in the library, and widely available online, suggests that the president's jokes on the day were ad-libbed, but of course they were included in the advance text published to the press.
In these 300 words Kennedy managed to acknowledge and introduce the significant members of his travelling party, including his sisters Eunice and Jean. He joked about how if his great-grandfather had not left he might have been working in the local Albatros factory across the river or in John V Kelly's local pub across the road.
Return journey
He also however made, in a subtle way, some significant points about the consequences and opportunity flowing from the Irish history of emigration. Speaking at the spot where his great-grandfather Patrick Kennedy had boarded the famine ship, the Dunbrody, in 1848 to begin his journey to America, Kennedy spoke of how it had taken 115 years and 6,000 miles for him to make the return journey. The point obvious to his audience of course was that while Patrick Kennedy in 1948 left as a peasant farmer John F Kennedy had come back in 1963 as president.
Notwithstanding the fact that the speech was short, Kennedy's carefully chosen words and the manner of the delivery meant none of those who waited for hours to hear him felt they had been short-changed. On the contrary, several in New Ross this week described the moment as the highlight of their childhood. It is an eloquent illustration of how something memorable yet effective can be better said in a short rather than a long speech. That which is concise is more likely to be profound.
Over the course of next Thursday in Dublin and next Friday and Saturday in New Ross and in Dunganstown there will be many words spoken as national and local personalities and politicians seek to capture the relevance of John F Kennedy's visit to Ireland in 1963. Those of us involved in putting some of the events together will be hoping to impose something approaching a 300-word limit on the speakers, at least as a general rule.
We will of course be happy to grant some leeway to members of the Kennedy family, who all seem to have inherited the gift of memorable speech-making.
On New Ross quayside next Saturday JFK's grandson will speak from almost the same spot as Kennedy spoke from in 1963 to honour his great-grandfather. In many ways these are likely to be among the most poignant remarks of the weekend. In terms of memorable Kennedy speeches, in New Ross at least, the torch will pass on once more to another generation.
John Joseph Parle (May 26, 1920 – July 10, 1943) was a United States Naval Reserve officer and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration—the Medal of Honor—for his actions in World War II. Parle was a 1942 ROTC graduate of Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska.
On July 9, 1943, Parle was serving as an ensign and was involved in the preparations for the Allied invasion of Sicily. On that day, he noticed a fire aboard a small boat loaded with explosives and ammunition. Knowing that an explosion would alert the defenders on Sicily of the impending invasion, he rushed to put out the fire. Although successful in dousing the flames, he later died of smoke inhalation.
Parle, aged 23 at his death, was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in his birth city of Omaha, Nebraska.
Medal of Honor citation [ edit ]
Ensign Parle's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
For valor and courage above and beyond the call of duty as Officer-in-Charge of Small Boats in the USS LST-375 during the amphibious assault on the island of Sicily, 9–10 July 1943. Realizing that a detonation of explosives would prematurely disclose to the enemy the assault about to be carried out, and with full knowledge of the peril involved, Ens. Parle unhesitatingly risked his life to extinguish a smoke pot accidentally ignited in a boat carrying charges of high explosives, detonating fuses and ammunition. Undaunted by fire and blinding smoke, he entered the craft, quickly snuffed out a burning fuse, and after failing in his desperate efforts to extinguish the fire pot, finally seized it with both hands and threw it over the side. Although he succumbed a week later from smoke and fumes inhaled, Ens. Parle's heroic self-sacrifice prevented grave damage to the ship and personnel and insured the security of a vital mission. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.

"Would Ronald Reagan be sitting here?" President Barack Obama abruptly left today's negotiating session to raise the debt ceiling and lower the deficit, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) told reporters after the meeting.
Cantor said Obama walked-out "angrily" after he offered to support two separate debt ceiling votes — a proposal Obama had repeatedly said he would veto.
"Eric, don't call my bluff," Obama said according to Cantor moments before storming out of the meeting. "I'm going to take this to the American people."
Cantor said all progress in the debt talks has been erased.
Update: According to Fox News, a senior Democratic aide pushed back at Cantor's account, saying "Congressman Cantor is the last person who should complain of people abruptly walking out of meetings."
Cantor publicly quit the deficit talks led by Vice President Joe Biden last month.
Republicans reportedly used the talks to criticize Obama's proposed spending cuts as "gimmicks and accounting tricks," according to Reuters.
Update 2: House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said no progress was made on the talks today.
"The president is putting a lot of time and energy into getting an agreement, and it's tough," Hoyer told POLITICO.
According to Cantor, Obama said that the group has until Friday to figure out "which way we're going." They will return to the White House tomorrow to try to get the talks back on track.
Update 3: Reuters is reporting that Obama would not back down on a comprehensive deal to raise debt ceiling, even if it jeopardizes his reelection chances.
"Would Ronald Reagan be sitting here," he reportedly asked. "I've reached my limit. This may bring my presidency down, but I will not yield on this.''
Update 4: Democratic aides continue to push back against Cantor's account, telling NBC's Luke Russert that Cantor was rude at the end of the meeting, and Obama ended it.
"Dem Aide, no walk out: Cantor rudely interrupted POTUS 3 times to advocate for short-term debt ceiling increases while BO was wrapping mtg," Russert tweeted.
A bipartisan group of senators has asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to curb the authority of police officers to confiscate money from people who haven't committed crimes.
The six senators, including one of Sessions' closest allies in recent years, want him to change Justice Department policy on civil asset forfeiture, a practice designed to crack down on crime syndicates by allowing police to seize money that they suspect is linked to criminal activity. That authority is controversial because law enforcement can seize the money even if no one is charged with a crime, so it's possible for innocent people to lose their property.
"We encourage the Department of Justice to revise its civil asset forfeiture practices to reflect our nation's commitment to the rule of law and due process," Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah; Rand Paul, R-Ky.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.; Tom Udall, D-N.M.; and Angus King, I-Maine, wrote to Sessions.
Suspicion of the confiscations has created unusual alliances among liberals, libertarians, and conservatives, which is reflected in the list of senators on the letter. The ACLU argues that "many police departments use forfeiture to benefit their bottom lines, making seizures motivated by profit rather than crime-fighting." And the senators noted that conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas expressed skepticism of the practice in a recent opinion.
"You need not wait for Supreme Court censure before reforming these practices, and, in any event, the Department of Justice should err on the side of protecting constitutional rights," they wrote to Sessions.
Law enforcement groups maintain that civil asset forfeiture is a useful tool, however, and Sessions and President Trump have embraced traditional law-and-order Republican policies. When a group of sheriffs visited the White House in February, one complained that a state senator in Texas was trying to restrict the forfeitures.
"Who is the state senator? Want to give his name? We'll destroy his career," Trump cracked.

Money is talking a bit louder in college admissions these days, according to a survey to be released Wednesday by Inside Higher Ed, an online publication for higher education professionals.
More than half of the admissions officers at public research universities, and more than a third at four-year colleges said that they had been working harder in the past year to recruit students who need no financial aid and can pay full price, according to the survey of 462 admissions directors and enrollment managers conducted in August and early September.
Similarly, 22 percent of the admissions officials at four-year institutions said the financial downturn had led them to pay more attention in their decision to applicants' ability to pay.
“As institutional pressures mount, between the decreased state funding, the pressure to raise a college's profile, and the pressure to admit certain students, we're seeing a fundamental change in the admissions process,” said David A. Hawkins, director of public policy and research at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. “Where many of the older admissions professionals came in through the institution and saw it as an ethically centered counseling role, there's now a different dynamic that places a lot more emphasis on marketing.”
In the survey, 10 percent of the admissions directors at four-year colleges — and almost 20 percent at private liberal-arts schools — said that the full-pay students they were admitting, on average, had lower grades and test scores than other admitted applicants.
But they are not the only ones with an edge: the admissions officers said they admitted minority students, athletes, veterans, children of alumni, international students and, for the sake of gender balance, men, with lesser credentials, too.
At many colleges and universities, the survey found, whom you know does matter. More than a quarter of the admissions directors said they had felt pressure from senior-level administrators to admit certain applicants, and almost a quarter got pressure from trustees or development officers.
“If external parties are trying to influence admissions decisions, that's a concern that strikes at the legitimacy of the whole process,” Mr. Hawkins said. “We certainly have standards, but there needs to be awareness that when the economy starts to crumble, the standards may start to go out the window.”
Lloyd Thacker, executive director of the Education Conservancy, a two-person nonprofit he founded in 2003 to improve college admissions, said the Inside Higher Ed findings were troubling.
“There's always been elements of this behavior, but it seems to me that it's growing,” Mr. Thacker said. “I don't know whether to blame it on hard times or lack of courage and leadership.”
Mr. Thacker said his own research had found students becoming more cynical about higher education.
“Students say, ‘They're cheating us, so we can cheat them,' ” he said. “The cheat they see is that colleges are out for themselves, not for them as students. Our research, with 2,500 students, found that of all the sources of information students get about higher education, they thought the least trustworthy sources are the colleges and college reps themselves.”
While community colleges said their most important challenge in the near future was reduced state funding, all the other institutions named rising concerns from families about tuition and affordability.
Admissions directors at many public universities said in the survey that recruiting more out-of-state and international students, who pay higher tuition, was their top strategy. At community colleges and private institutions, admissions officers were more likely to say that providing aid for low- and middle- income students was their focus.
More than half the admissions officers from four-year institutions said that coaching by parents or college counselors was making it harder to really learn about applicants.
Brittany Sater, 26, was shot and killed early Sunday morning.
The Bloomington Police Department responded to the call at 12:50 a.m. at the 2300 block of South Rogers Street.
BPD Capt. Steve Kellams said the victim was pronounced dead at IU Bloomington Hospital at 9:56 a.m. Sunday.
When BPD arrived at the scene, the victim was at a neighbor's house.
Police said she was suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest. She was transported to the hospital in critical condition.
Investigators are still determining what happened and who was involved.
Preliminary evidence indicates that two suspects, possibly a male and female that the victim knew, entered the victim's home and shot her with a shotgun, Kellams said.
BPD said based on the crime scene, they believe the shooting occurred over drugs.
The suspects are no longer in the Bloomington Area, Kellams said.
The investigation is ongoing, and anyone with information should contact BPD at 812-339-4477.

As the San Francisco 49ers media met with head coach Jim Harbaugh this morning, it came with surprising news as Harbaugh said CB Eric Wright is pondering retirement. Breaking news straight from 49ers headquarters, Harbaugh spoke on Wright's decision saying, “Believe he's making a decision to not play football.” Wright who came to San Francisco last season has not lived up to expectations and would in all likelihood be in a camp battle for a backup cornerback spot with CB Chris Cook, CB Perrish Cox, and CB Darryl Morris.
So with the 49ers now having an open roster spot canbe the next man up? A question that was asked by Sacramento Bee's, Harbaugh said “Long standing policy we don't talk about nobody who's not one of our players and the personnel department looks at all available players.”
With Wright now off the board, that leaves the 49ers with an extra roster spot and with many free-agent cornerbacks on the roster, the question remains who will the 49ers pick up?
When I was a youngster I used to be one to scoff at cycle touring. I was “too cool for school” and thought it was only for non-serious cyclists. Then I tried it. I rode along the Mediterranean from Barcelona to Nice and then up to Paris with the panniers on. It was the trip of a lifetime and I can't recommend it highly enough. There's no better way to see a country than by bike. Over Christmas my mate Daniel did a touring trip in India that would be a dream to do one day. In this guest post Daniel shares his experiences from this trip as well as a few tips on cycle touring.
The Backstory
I'm going to be transparent about the purpose of this story: To encourage you to try independent cycle touring.
If you're reading this, you're likely a roadie whose interest probably extends far beyond doing the same bunch rides on the same roads, at the same time, with the same people, to the same cafes, to order the same coffee.
If you are reading this you probably derive a childlike satisfaction from tearing around on two circles and two triangles, and there are other places to do this than Bright and Beach Road.
Three years ago, a mate and I flew into Sri Lanka with 5kg of hand-luggage and bought two local single-speed mountain bikes brand new for about $75 each. The bikes were heavy and poorly manufactured, but did the trick given the relatively flat and short rides we did on our 5-week tour of the stunning teardrop island. At the end of our trip we gave our bikes away to kids and returned home, with a hunger for more.
I'd been to India twice before and settled on South India as a destination. I was interested in doing a cycle tour that required me to carry as little as possible. Following the Keep It Simple Stupid theory, I built up a simple touring bike as bought a ticket. That's all the planning and preparation I did.
The Bike
With the help of Bike Gallery I built a steel Surly Crosscheck frameset with strong box-section rims laced up with 32 traditional J-bend spokes wrapped in Schwable Marathon Dureme 700x35mm tyres. I found them to be perfect for the varying road conditions and even took them on a few cheeky singletrack adventures. I chose XT Shimano V-Brakes, which are much more powerful and easier to adjust than cantilevers and more simple than disc brakes.
I ran a 10speed drive-train (50-34 / 12-27) with Dura-Ace bar-end shifters. There were some very steep sections of road where fully loaded with panniers a smaller gear would have been like a holiday. SRAM do a 11-32 Apex cassette, which would have been perfect.
In terms of touring ‘additions' I used a Tubus Logo rear rack which has a nice low centre of gravity when loaded up with two small Ortlieb Classic Front Roller panniers, which are intended for the front but fit well on the back. I also used a small handlebar bag to distribute weight to the front.
I carried my tools in a bidon including a hand-pump, a 15mm spanner, 4/5/6mm Allen Keys, a Leatherman, some lube, tyre levers and cable ties. In terms of spares, I carried two tubes, a powerlink, a brake and a gear cable and a few spare bolts. The main bidon was replaced with a Topeak cage that fits a 2 litre spring water bottle. In total I carried less than 8kg of stuff, which was the key to a comfortable and hassle-free tour. I had no punctures or mechanicals.
The Ride
I landed at Goa's small and quirky airport early in the morning and tore open my cardboard bike box and began to assemble it as a large crowd of curious taxi drivers gathered around. They seemed surprised that I was able to assemble the bike with only a few small tools; one friendly dude said “No hammer? For an Indian cycle you need a hammer to fix.”
There were no issues with the bike and after about half an hour I was on the road. In the five weeks I covered about 2000km, sometimes moving from village to village, sometimes going on unloaded day adventures.
My route consisted of exploring almost every road in Goa, hopping from beach to beach followed by a push directly East, inland over the Western Ghats toward the ancient city of Hampi in Central Kanartaka, then back to the coast through National Parks before returning North back to Goa for my flight home.
The Western Ghats are a mountain range that stretch down the West Coast of India peaking at nearly 3000m. Fortunately, the pass I had to climb to get to Hampi was only 700m. Although it was a difficult day of climbing, the day that followed was much for testing, even though it was short and relatively flat. The combination of strong headwinds, a non-stop procession of goods carriers storming through red-dust clouds to and from mines, roads that had deteriorated down to their foundations stretching for almost 50km made it one of the hardest days I have ever had on the bike. It was this day that made me sick; my body shut down.
After 36 hours banged up in a dirty local hotel watching Bollywood films, eating Bananas and drinking Oral Rehydration Solution I was ready to move on. After a final 160km day of pretty good roads I arrived in Hampi. It was well worth the trip; it's a magical place that should be on your bucket list. I spent one week there doing some rock-climbing, walking and getting my shoulder sewn up by a fellow tourist on the floor of a guest house after an attack from a thorny tree whilst exploring riding along a trail.
I made my way back to the coast and a week later I landed in Melbourne, re-assembled my bike near the taxi-stand and rode home from Melbourne International Airport. It rained, for the first time in 5 weeks.
The Tips
• Take less. In countries that are setup for tourism there is no need to take a kitchen or camp. Simply plan your ride so you can hop from town to town.
• Take the back way. National Highways and State Highways are often the shortest route, but never the most interesting or safe.
• Manage your tire pressure. When fully loaded it is important to ensure you don't run pressure so low that you'll pinch flat. Conversely, you'll be bounced around terribly if you run pressures too high.
• Use a smartphone for GPS and maps. Load up maps when you have WiFi in bigger towns and you'll have a full cache of accurate maps in your jersey pocket.
• Wear proper kit. Having nice plain kit made the rides much more comfortable. I thought it would make me look weird to the locals, but in truth, when you rock up in a small town in the middle of nowhere covered in dust on a bicycle you look weird regardless of your spandex.
• Ride your bell. Vital for safety. Ding ding!
• Wear a helmet. You may feel like you're the only one in who does, but the cost is small and the benefit big.
• Ride early. I would generally set out just after sunrise and ride till about noon when it started to get really hot.
• Be like water, not like stone. Countries like India can be very frustrating and difficult if you resist and defend. If you relax and go with the flow you'll have a much easier and more enjoyable time.
• Other interesting and suitable destinations for this type of tour include Laos/Cambodia/Vietnam, Madagascar, Sri Lanka and Central America.

Some things don't change. Buckley Jr., William. Up From Liberalism (1959):
“A second marked characteristic of the Liberal in debate with the conservative is the tacit premise that debate is ridiculous because there is nothing whatever to debate about . Arguments based on fact are especially to be avoided. Many people shrink from arguments over facts because facts are tedious , because they require a formal familiarity with the subject under discussion , and because they can be ideologically dislocative . Many Liberals accept their opinions , ideas , and evaluations as others accept revealed truths , and the facts are presumed to conform to the doctrines , as any dutiful fact will ; so why discuss the fact?” (Kindle Locations 522-527).
I think that anybody who attempted to engage a Liberal in a climate debate would wholeheartedly endorse this statement.
“In dismissing a conservative's contentions, it is not enough merely to say that the matter under ‘discussion' is closed; it is usually necessary, for the sake of discipline, to berate the person who brought the matter up.” (Kindle Locations 527-529).
This observation is obsolete today. Modern “Liberals” are much lower than their namesakes sixty years ago. They feel necessary to smear their opponents, and, occasionally, to threaten or call for actions against them. From the Foreword:
“The ‘libera' mentality which Mr . Buckley puts over a barrel in this book is , I am beginning to suspect, the ideological camouflage of the will to power of this new ruling class. I can't find any other explanation of these fits of hysteria, these fixations which time will prove to have been irrational, some of which are so amusingly documented in this book. The Communists are excellent propagandists who have developed an uncanny skill in putting their words in other people's mouths , but they are not that good.” (Foreword by John Dos Passos, Kindle Locations 111-114)
In The Times today, a cautionary tale about an increasingly popular income alternative for older people: reverse mortgages.
Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports that the very loans that are supposed to help the elderly stay in their homes are instead pushing some out.
Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners 62 and older to borrow money against the value of their homes and not pay it back until they move out or die, have long been fraught with problems. But federal and state regulators are documenting new instances of abuse as smaller mortgage brokers, including former subprime lenders, flood the market after the recent exit of big banks and as defaults on the loans hit record rates. Some lenders are aggressively pitching loans to seniors who cannot afford the fees associated with them, not to mention the property taxes and maintenance. Others are wooing seniors with promises that the loans are free money that can be used to finance long-coveted cruises, without clearly explaining the risks. Some widows are facing eviction after they say they were pressured to keep their name off the deed without being told that they could be left facing foreclosure after their husbands died.
The Times reports that more reverse mortgages are ending in foreclosure.
Although the numbers of reverse mortgages have declined in recent years, the rate of default is at a record high — roughly 9.4 percent of loans, according to the consumer protection bureau, up from around 2 percent a decade earlier. And borrowers are putting their nest eggs at risk by increasingly taking out the loans at younger ages and in lump sums, federal data and a recent bureau report show.

Jeff Brown
When a blizzard dumped 2 feet of snow on Newark, New Jersey, just after Christmas in 2010, Cory Booker, who was then mayor, carefully monitored the storm from his Twitter account. He responded to tweets from residents, and he mobilized city workers. And when resident Linda H. (@msxmasbaby) tweeted, “Is there NE city volunteers 2 dig some1 out? I'm going 2 have medical procedure done,” he showed up with a shovel. That's the way Booker rolls. He was early to social media and has made prolific use of it (47,500 tweets and counting) to connect with voters. So when he arrived in the US Senate in 2013, he was dismayed to discover just how out of place he was when it came to his tech-forward approach to government. The legislative body seemed stodgy and alarmingly behind the times, even by government standards, he says. “When they told me I couldn't sit on the Senate floor with an iPad—that the technology wasn't even permitted—I breathed deep and knew that I was going to have to start pushing.” To that end, he has recently teamed up with Missouri senator Claire McCaskill to ask for seven reforms. These include streamlining the requirements for email newsletters, letting Senate offices use analytics services to track social media, and adapting the Congressional Record to a more accessible XML format. There's no telling how likely they are to succeed. But this heavy lifting won't require a snow shovel.
One Man's Path to the Senate
1992 A football player and class president, Cory Booker completes bachelor's and master's degrees at Stanford
1997 Finishes law school at Yale, having already studied at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar.
1998 Starts political career as a city council member in Newark, New Jersey.
2006 Becomes mayor of Newark, promising to reduce crime and encourage economic development.
2008 @corybooker sends first tweet, plugging an appearance on The Rachel Maddow Show.
2013 Wins US Senate seat in a special election to replace the late Frank Lautenberg.
Why now?
I am very respectful of the Senate's important traditions, but it also has to keep up with the times.
What can't you do that you would like to do?
A lot of things!
What's the deal with the Senate ban on social media analytics tools, which could help senators surface issues from constituents?
Right now, if I ask my constituents questions on social media, it's treated as if it's a poll. And that's just ridiculous.
The Senate just wants to prevent members from using online polling as a campaign tool. But the analytics ban inadvertently prevents lawmakers from identifying voters' priorities.
Every sector of society looks at digital analytics in a productive way. Limiting my ability to use them is just unacceptable. And by the way, Congress conducts polls using traditional methods. No one is using social media analytics as a substitute for that.

What else would you like to change?
We're not providing information to the public in a format that is useful. Lobbyists, for example, are all the more powerful because they have information that citizens generally don't.
Because they attend Senate hearings and develop relationships with committee members?
Right. We should be upset about that. There should be easily searchable databases of the Senate's business. If you live in New York City, you can go into a restaurant and use an app that gives you complete transparency about the health record of that restaurant. It's there because the Bloomberg administration released the bulk data from its health department, which innovative people used to make apps.
We are not doing that, but just imagine if we did.
You could have an app that alerts you every time legislation that's important to you is being marked up in committee and when it makes it to the floor for a vote—and what poison pills might be slipped into it.
Do you think the American public is more tech-savvy than the government gives it credit for?
I don't think there's that conscious critique going on. There are no digital natives in the Senate. There are Gen Xers like me who are starting to pop up, people born around 1970, who have a lot of experience using these tools.
As mayor, when I gave more tools to my constituents to make their city better, they leaned into that. Residents knew if they tweeted me about a pothole it would be addressed. It became a powerful tool for me to make my city offices accountable.
__What prompted you to join Twitter? __
A woman named Sarah Ross got Ashton Kutcher to call City Hall. I thought I was being punk'd. Kutcher explained the potential for someone on a local-government level to increase their level of service, and he thought it could help change the world's view of Newark.
Urban spaces are so often disrespected by traditional media—talk show hosts always make fun of cities. One night Conan O'Brien, who was then host of The Tonight Show, criticized Newark.
I recorded a short response video and posted it to YouTube, bragging about Newark, and then I basically said, “By the power vested in me by the city of Newark, I hereby ban Conan O'Brien from Newark Airport.” My last line was: “Try JFK, buddy.”
Conan responded on his show by banning me from the Burbank airport. The kerfuffle grew so big that Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, told us in her own video, “The time has come to make peace.” Conan and NBC ended up giving $100,000 to a Newark charity.
My point is, when we embraced social media, we took more control of the Newark narrative. We increased responsiveness toward residents. We drew more of our constituents in to participate in government and improve our cities.
You asked the Senate to approve buying targeted advertising on the web so that you could communicate more effectively with constituents. So if you wanted to make a specific group of people aware of a tax break, you might be able to connect with them more cheaply and quickly through Facebook ads than in a letter, is that correct?
Yes, that tool would allow Senate offices to more effectively reach people who need government services. Sending letters to constituents is a waste of taxpayer dollars and it's not as effective at targeting the ones who actually need the service.
The Senate doesn't allow cloud-based services either, right?
This is an example of where the Senate is not just behind the rest of the nation, it's behind the rest of the government. Cloud-based services are less expensive, more secure, more efficient, and faster. The Department of Defense uses the cloud.
Are there other areas where government isn't keeping up with technology?
We have an FAA that is slowing down the exploration of drone technology. We have other offices that, because of their slow movement, threaten the next wave of innovation. Our patent office has a backlog of applications in the hundreds
of thousands.
What could politicians learn from those in tech? And what could techies learn from politicians?
I want more of my colleagues to understand the limitless potential technology offers us to deal with a lot of our enduring challenges as a democracy. On the flip side, the growing cynicism about government among tech innovators is not helpful. In fact, it's hurtful. People like Ben Franklin, the great innovators of their time,
were directly involved in shaping their government. Innovators reimagine our world in so many areas. We need them to help reimagine what government can and should be.

The brother of an RCMP officer slain last week in Moncton, N.B., told mourners at an emotional regimental funeral service Tuesday that he was struggling with the loss of his “best friend,” and wished he could tell him “just one more time that I love him.”
Speaking before thousands at Moncton Coliseum, Daniel Larche said he thought of his brother, Doug Larche, as “invincible.”
"Doug chose to serve. He loved being a police officer and the people of Moncton were lucky to have him in their community," said Daniel Larche, a master seaman in the Royal Canadian Navy. "He was not only my brother, but my best friend."
Police officers, residents and family members filled the 7,000-seat stadium for a three-hour service that honoured the lives of Larche, 40, and Constables Fabrice Georges Gevaudan, 45, and Dave Joseph Ross, 32. The three men were killed in the line of duty last week.
Daniel Larche told mourners never “in his worst nightmare” did he envision delivering a eulogy for his brother. A married father of three young daughters, Doug Larche was in the “prime of his life,” his brother said.
“I want him back so badly so that I can tell him just one more time that I love him and that I am proud of the great man that he has become,” Daniel Larche said, his voice shaking with emotion.
It was one of several tributes to honour the fallen officers, whose flag-draped caskets were carried into the stadium one-by-one following a 1.6-kilometre procession in Moncton. Among the marchers who followed the hearses were members of the RCMP and municipal police forces, correctional officers and U.S. border patrol officers.
At the beginning of the service, the officers' Stetsons and holstered weapons were laid on top of their caskets. Large portraits of the fallen officers in their uniforms were also on display.
The family of David Ross told the crowd he was a man of integrity who put his all into everything he did. His passion for dogs led him to police work as a dog-services handler. Danny, a police dog that served with Ross, stood by his master's casket during the service.
Ross, a married father of one, was looking forward to becoming a father again, as his wife is six months pregnant with their second child.
In a eulogy, Ross's brother-in-law, Adrian Vander Ploeg, recalled how Ross was making dinner when reports of a gunman came in last Wednesday. He dropped everything -- leaving the barbecue lid up and the garage door open -- in order to respond.
"For those closest to Dave, that barbecue left still open says everything about who Dave was and his devotion to those around him," Vander Ploeg said.
Const. Fabrice Gevaudan was remembered for his smile, compassion, empathy and quick wit. Originally from France, Gevaudan had called New Brunswick home for more than six years, and was described as a doting husband and stepfather.
“Fabrice lived a heart-centred life a life of joy and happiness, a life where he connected to the community in which he lived,” Geoffrey McLatchie, Gevaudan's friend and spiritual adviser, told the mourners. "He was very comfortable in his own skin and he was his own man."
Prime Minister Stephen Harper, also paid tribute to the three officers, telling the crowd of mourners that “the grief is shared by all Canadians from coast to coast.”
Harper said a “searing grief” rippled throughout New Brunswick as “we struggle for answers.”
“We ask what in God's name happened here and why. We may never know,” Harper said, calling what happened to the fallen officers and the community an “outrage.”
In another emotional tribute, Assistant Commissioner Roger Brown, commanding officer of the RCMP for New Brunswick, honoured the fallen officers, as well as Constables Eric Dubois and Darlene Goguen, two officers who were wounded in the shootings.
"With the eyes of the nation upon us today, I want to publicly say how incredibly proud I am of each and every one of you," he told the officers in the crowd.
Choking back tears, Brown added that he wished that “I could have told Doug, Dave and Fabrice that in person.”
Opposition Leader Tom Mulcair, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, Gov.-Gen. David Johnston, and several premiers also attended the services.
RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson, who spoke briefly, said Canada won't forget the “ultimate sacrifice” made by the fallen officers.
"I am proud of them, and Canada as a whole is grateful,” he said.
Gevaudan, Larche and Ross were shot last Wednesday evening after responding to reports of a man with firearms in a residential neighbourhood in north Moncton. The shootings prompted a massive manhunt and lockdown that ended 30 hours later following the arrest a 24-year-old Moncton man.
Justin Bourque has been charged with three charges of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. He is scheduled to be in provincial court July 3.

Germany says it plans to move its aircraft and military personnel out of Turkey's Incirlik airbase, as Turkey refuses to allow visits by German MPs.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said they would relocate to Jordan's Azraq airbase.
German Tornado jets fly reconnaissance missions over Iraq and Syria from Incirlik, helping US-led forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS).
German-Turkish talks broke down in Ankara on Monday.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said 250 German troops and military equipment would have to transfer from Incirlik, in southern Turkey.
The reason, he explained, was that his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu had told him visits to the base by German MPs could not take place.
According to Ms von der Leyen, Jordan has agreed to host the German contingent at Azraq. She said there would be a suspension of the German surveillance flights for a few weeks.
Germany also flies a tanker plane from Incirlik to refuel warplanes participating in the air campaign against IS.
The German government is expected to formally approve the transfer later this month.
Verbal attacks
Last month, Turkey prevented a group of German MPs from visiting Incirlik, citing as a reason Germany's decision to grant asylum to Turkish soldiers it accuses of taking part in last year's attempted coup.
More than 400 Turkish military staff, diplomats, members of the judiciary and other officials and their relatives have applied for political asylum in Germany. Some requests have been granted, though Germany has not given a precise figure.
A bitter war of words erupted between the two Nato allies in the run-up to Turkey's 16 April referendum, which resulted in President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan winning sweeping new powers.
He was furious that Germany prevented Turkish ministers from campaigning for him on German soil, and he accused Berlin of "Nazi-style" behaviour.
Meanwhile, Germany remains concerned over Turkey's detention of German-Turkish Die Welt journalist Deniz Yucel.
A couple of months ago, a video titled “Busted: Pilot Forgets to Turn Off CHEMTRAILS Before Landing” was uploaded to YouTube. (The version seen here is not the original upload, which was later removed with copyright claims.) Because the original was taken down, the exact view count isn't known, but it accumulated enough interest to be given the (admittedly nebulous) label “viral video” by Discovery News. Certainly, for a short and low-quality YouTube video about chemtrails, it was unusually popular.
ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website
The video is 40 seconds long, the first five of which are unintelligible. It quickly becomes clear (well, hazily clear) that we're seeing footage of an airplane coming in low for a landing at night. Trailing behind it are several stripes of aircraft exhaust. The plane passes a few lampposts, and by the 25-second mark, it's safely on the ground. At that point, the camera's operator zooms out and shifts left and up, panning over a stream of condensation left in the sky.
To most, this condensation would seem to be a pretty standard byproduct of flying in what look to be fairly foggy conditions. Hot airplane exhaust mixes with the lower-temperature atmosphere around it, and in the process, creates water vapor.

(I should add that I did not know exactly how to describe that process off the top of my head. I read about it on the Internet, and it made sense to me, so I'm repeating it here.)
But to the person who posted it, these 40 seconds show something much more sinister. It's not that he or she does not believe that the meeting of hot and cold air produces moisture, or that (though I wouldn't want to take words out of his or her mouth) every airplane that emits exhaust is up to no good. No, it's that real condensation shouldn't hang around so long, and that some airplanes are releasing a lot more than hot air.
THE BIRTH OF THE chemtrail conspiracy (the word “chemtrail” being a combination of chemical and contrail, and the word “contrail” a combination of condensation and trail) is generallypinpointed to a few-year window surrounding 1996. It was that year when the U.S. Air Force was first accused of using military aircraft to “spray” American citizens with mysterious substances, evidenced by the unusual contrail patterns left in the sky.
The third-best way to fan the flames of a conspiracy is to say you were only speaking hypothetically. The second-best way is to say, unequivocally, that any given practice isn't government policy. And the first-best way is to then say you've investigated people's concerns, and found them to be untrue
Probably not coincidentally, 1996 was also the year that a report called “Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025” was presented (and made public) by students of the Air University. As an assignment, the Air Force chief of staff asked the study's authors to “examine the concepts, capabilities, and technologies the United States will require to remain the dominant air and space force in the future."
Though the paper's introduction clearly specifies that it does not reflect official government policy, and that the weather modification and control scenarios described within it are “fictional representations of future situations/scenarios,” some took it as evidence that the government was actively working to control and manipulate the Earth's climate.
Unfortunately for the Air Force, the third-best way to fan the flames of a conspiracy is to say you were only speaking hypothetically. The second-best way is to say, unequivocally, that any given practice isn't government policy. And the first-best way is to then say you've investigated people's concerns, and found them to be untrue—which the Air Force did in 2002. And in 2005.
In the years since, the chemtrail conspiracy has spawned dozens of semi-activist websites and forums, like Aircrap.org and Chemtrails911.com. Most recently, many have latched on to this summer's Snowpiercer, a movie in which the government sprays chemicals into the sky in order to stop global warming, but instead “accidentally” creates a new ice age, killing everyone except a select few who are on board a perpetually moving train. The allegations from chemtrail activists are both broad and vague—it's not particularly clear why the United States government would be poisoning its own people, for example, and, if they were, why they wouldn't use a method more effective than spraying something in our general direction from 35,000 feet and hoping for the best—but one common, predominant thread is that chemtrails are making us sick.
One of the symptoms often said to be caused by chemtrails is very gross, and odd, and I'm sorry to write it here because upon reading you'll almost certainly feel like it's happening to you too: Many people who believe they've been infected by chemtrails also begin to believe that small, thread-like fibers are crawling out of their skin.
MORGELLONS DISEASE IS PROBABLY not a real disease. At least not in the way its sufferers think of it. It's a strange name, in that it's used both by people who believe they have it, and by people who say that believing they have it is all that it is. Many (if not most; though likely most) doctors and scientists consider it a form of delusional parasitosis, a kind of psychosis in which patients believe they're infested by parasites or other organisms that are not actually present.
Pressured by an Internet-based community of supporters (started by a mother who diagnosed her two-year-old son with the condition), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention undertook an investigation into the supposed disease, publishing its results in 2012. Researchers found no “causative medical condition” or infectious agent, and they instead attributed patients' symptoms to delusional parasitosis. (Some of the patients likely had other potential contributing factors—50 percent tested positive for drugs.)
Still, severalswaths of the Internet continue to reference the disease—and the health threat presented by so-called chemtrails in general—in earnest. This page even presents preventive dietary recommendations and a recipe for something called “Spring Hepatic Detox” tea, which the author writes is “Good to do, if you have been tested for heavy metals.”
Many of these sites' authors and forum contributors post pictures of themselves taken from microscope slides: pieces of skin and specks and fibers, all thread-y looking and strange-colored, the way all hyper-zoomed in images of things are. I could look at them forever (not that I'm volunteering—this is a hypothetical), but it wouldn't make a difference. That's all a conspiracy theory really needs, isn't it? I admit, I like them for their reliability: Two opposing teams looking at the exact same thing, each convinced the other is missing it for what it really is.
We're now about mid-way through the Firefox 57 development cycle. The progress of Quantum Flow bugs has been steady, we now have 65 open [qf:p1] bugs at the time of this writing and 283 fixed bugs. There are still more bugs being flagged for triage constantly. I haven't really spoken much about the triage process lately and the reason is that it has been working as per usual and the output should be fairly visible to everyone through our dashboard.
On the Speedometer front, if you are watching the main tracking bugs, the addition of new dependencies every once in a while should be an indication that we are still profiling the benchmark looking for more areas where we can think of speedup opportunities. Finding these new opportunities has become more and more difficult as we have been fixing more and more of the existing performance issues, which is exactly what you would expect working on improving the performance of Firefox on such a benchmark workload. Of course, we still have ongoing work in the existing dependency tree (which is quite massive at this point) so more improvements should hopefully arrive as we keep landing more fixes on this front.
I realize that I have been quite inconsistent in having a performance story section in these newsletters, and I hope the readers will forgive me for that! 🙂 But these past couple of weeks, Jan de Mooij's continued effort on removing getProperty/setProperty JSClass hooks from SpiderMonkey made me want to write a few sentences about some useful lessons we have learned from performance measurements which can hopefully be used in the future when designing new components/subsystems. Often times when we are thinking of how to design software, one can think of many extension points at various levels which consumers of the code can plug into in order to customize behavior. But many such extension points come at a runtime cost. The cost is usually quite small, we may need to consume some additional memory to store more state, we may need to branch on some conditions, we may need to perform some more indirect/virtual calls, etc. The problem is that usually this cost is extremely small, and it can easily go unnoticed. But this can often happen in many places, and over time performance issues like this tend to creep in and hide in corners. Of course, usually when these extension points are added there are good reasons for creating them, but it may be a good idea to ask questions like “Is this mechanism too high level of a solution for this specific problem?”, “Is the runtime cost paid for this over the years to come justified to solve the issue at hand?”, “Could this issue be solved by adding an extension point in a more specialized place where the added cost would only affect a subset of the consumers?”, etc. The reality of software engineering is that in a lot of cases we need to trade off having a generic, extensible architecture in our code versus having efficient code, so if you end up choosing extensibility, it's a good idea to ensure you have had the performance aspects in mind. It's even better if you document the performance concerns!
And since we touched on this, now may be a good time to also take a quick moment to call out another issue which I have seen come up on some of the performance issues we have been looking into in the past few months. That is the death by a thousand cuts performance problems. In my experience, many of the performance issues that we need to deal with, when profiled turn out to be caused by only a few really badly performing parts of the code, or at least are due to a few underlying causes. But we also have no shortage of the other kind of performance issues which are honestly much more difficult to deal with. The way things work out in the opposite scenario is you look at a profile from the badly performing case, you narrow down on the section of the profile which demonstrates the issue, and no matter how hard you squint, there are no major issues to be fixed. Rather, the profile shows many individual issues each contributing to a tiny portion of the time spent during the workload. These performance issues are much harder to analyze (since there are typically many ways you can start approaching it and it's unclear where is a good place to start) and they take a much longer time to result in measurable improvements, as you'd need to fix quite a few issues in order to be able to measure the resulting improvement. For a good example of this, please look at the saga of optimizing setting the value property of input elements. This project has been going on for a few months now, and during this time the workload has been made faster by more than an order of magnitude, but still if you look at each of the individual patches that have landed, they look like micro-optimizations, and that's for a good reason, because they are. But overall they add up to significant improvements.
Before closing, it is worth mentioning that the ongoing performance work isn't suddenly going to stop with the release of Firefox 57! In fact we have large performance projects which are going to get ready after Firefox 57, and that is a good thing, since I view Firefox 57 not as an ultimate performance goal, but as a solid performance foundation for us to start building upon. A great example is the Quantum Render project which has been going on for a long time now. This project aims to integrate the WebRender component of Servo into Firefox. This project now has an exciting newsletter, and the first two issues are out! Please take a moment to check it out.
And now it is time to take a moment to thank the contributions of those who helped make Firefox faster last week. As usual I hope I'm not forgetting any names!
New Screenshots and Details of Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Extend Revealed
Giuseppe Nelva September 29, 2011 11:54:15 PM EST
Sega released today a whole slew of new screenshots and information about the upcoming PSP title Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Extend.
First of all, the difficulty levels have been detailed. There are four levels, easy, normal, hard and extreme. On easy you will be able to play the whole game by pressing a single button, while on hardcore you'll have to activate the octopus mode on your fingers in order to use the whole set of controls on the PSP. I can't even imagine myself managing to do that.
Some new outfits have also been shown, and new tracks have been announced: SPiCa -39's Giving Day Edition-, Nekomi mi Switch (Catgirl Switch), Sekiranun Graffiti (Cumulonimbus Graffiti), Uraomote Lovers (Black Cover Lovers) and Ring Ring Singnal -Append Mix-.
You can see the whole set of screenshots past the cut.
SALT LAKE CITY — Snowboarders have wanted to "free" Alta for years.
On Wednesday, four of them and a group called Wasatch Equality filed a federal lawsuit on the Little Cottonwood Canyon resort, challenging its longstanding skiers-only policy.
A lawyer for the snowboarders said that because of Alta Ski Area's arrangement with the U.S. Forest Service, it must comply with the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Forest Service is also named as defendant.
"Alta is one of only three ski resorts in the United States that does not allow snowboarding, and Alta is the only one of these resorts that is operated on public land controlled by the Forest Service," said Jonathan Schofield, an attorney with Parr Brown Gee and Loveless.
The ban excludes a "particular class of individuals from use and enjoyment of public land based on irrational discrimination against snowboarders," he said.
It pits those who stand sideways on a single "snowboard" against those who stand forward on "skis," creating hostility and divisiveness, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.
After a blue-bird day on the slopes, crowds of skiers walked to their cars in the late afternoon, many of them insisting the resort is a better place without snowboarders. However, they say that without any malice toward snowboarders either.
"I don't know how it would change the atmosphere around here," said skier Neil Rosenberg of Salt Lake City. "I personally like that it's a skier only resort," he said.
Alexey Pismenskiy, a Utah skier originally from Russia, agreed. He said he just feels safer in the skier-only environment. He explains that many snowboarders follow a different line on the hill than skiers do. When he skis among the snowboarders at other resorts, he doesn't feel the other people are moving in a predictable manner.
"For me it's just a security, a safety question," Pismenskiy said.

2 Utah resorts among last in US to forbid snowboarding One down, three to go. That's the word from the ski industry as another U.S. ski resort opens its slopes to snowboarders.
However, plaintiff Drew Hicken said there is no reason skiing and snowboarding can't coexist.
"We feel that it is time for Alta to let go of outdated prejudices that perpetuate a skier versus snowboarder mentality and allow everyone, regardless of whether they are skiers or snowboarders, to share the mountain together," he said.
An Alta spokeswoman said the resort wants to gather more information before commenting on the lawsuit.
One out-of-state skier coming off the mountain Wednesday says Alta is for skiers.
"It's the only place left. Give it to 'em. Snowboarders go anywhere else you want to go, but leave Alta for the skiers," Kevin Hurley said. "Where we live, we gotta deal with snowboarders, and we'd rather deal with skiers."
Snowboarders have a reputation, deserved or not, for riding reckless and without regard for others on the mountain.
Diane Harrington, who snowboards and skis, called the lawsuit a "good idea."
"I think it should be figured out in the courts. I think it's OK that Alta restricts use of the lift, but I don't think it's fair that they keep people off (U.S.) Forest Service property," she said. "Our taxes pay for it equally. It's almost like discrimination of sorts."
In 1986, Beaver Mountain, Brighton and Park West (now The Canyons) were the only Utah resorts that allowed snowboarders on their chairlifts. Since then, all but Alta and Deer Valley have followed suit. Mad River Glen in Vermont is the third American resort that doesn't permit snowboarding.
By 1990, most major ski areas around the country allowed snowboarding, which became one of the fastest-growing winter sports.
Alta has not always prohibited snowboarding, according to the lawsuit. It allowed snowboarders to ride its chairlifts in the early 1980s, and Hicken and another plaintiff Richard Varga were among some of the first snowboarders at Alta.
But by the mid '80s, Alta "summarily" decided it would no longer allow snowboarders to access its terrain or ride its lifts, the lawsuit says. The policy was borne of "animus" or hostility toward snowboarders.
Alta operates under a Forest Service permit that states the public lands "shall remain open to the public for all lawful purposes," according to the lawsuit. The ski area covers 2,130 acres — 1,802 acres or 85 percent of which is on public land.

CINCINNATI -- Donovan McNabb expected to keep playing until someone scored, no matter how long it took. Mercifully, the NFL's rules set a time limit on terrible play.
Eagles 13, Bengals 13. It couldn't have ended any other way.
McNabb fumbled and threw three interceptions in regulation Sunday, and the Bengals botched the only scoring chance in overtime, leaving the equally inept teams with the NFL's first tied game in six years.
Cincinnati's Shayne Graham missed a 47-yard field goal with 7 seconds left in overtime, falling to the ground as the ball sailed a few inches wide to the right. It was a fitting finish to a game played like the very definition of a tie. Despite all the shanked punts and trick plays, this one went nowhere.
"Terrible," Bengals quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick said.
No one was more surprised than McNabb that it ended so soon -- 3 hours, 46 minutes after the opening kickoff. The 10th-year quarterback thought it would keep going until someone scored, just like a playoff game.
Wrong.
"I didn't know that," said McNabb, who played a leading role in keeping it tied. "I've never been part of a tie. I never even knew it was in the rule book. I was looking forward to getting the opportunity to get out there and try to drive to win the game. But unfortunately with the rules, we settled with a tie."
It was the first tied game in the NFL since Nov. 10, 2002, when the Falcons and Steelers finished 34-34 with Michael Vick and Tommy Maddox matching each other pass for pass. In this one, the teams matched each other gaffe for gaffe.
The Eagles (5-4-1) have yet to win a close game this season, going 0-4 with a tie in games decided by less than a touchdown. McNabb had a big hand in this one, matching his career high with three interceptions and setting up 10 of Cincinnati's points.
He nearly had another pass picked off in overtime, but Johnathan Joseph dropped a potential interception near midfield. Each team had three chances in the extra 15-minute quarter, but only the Bengals (1-8-1) got close enough to try a field goal.
They missed it, leaving them with only their second tied game in franchise history. They played Houston to a 31-31 tie in 1969, their second season.
"We didn't win. We didn't lose, either," said Graham, who had been 6-for-6 from 40-49 yards. "But sometimes, tying stings a little more."
Philadelphia hadn't finished with a tie since a 10-10 game against Baltimore in 1997. The Eagles' defense had eight sacks and compensated for McNabb's fumble by pulling off a goal-line stand from the 1 in the first half. The game soon settled in that pattern -- a blitzing defense trying to erase the offense's mishaps.
It ended in a draw.
McNabb, who had only five interceptions coming in, went 28-of-58 for 339 yards. He repeatedly missed open receivers in an offense that has come to rely on him almost entirely because it can't run.
Following Fitbit's acquisition of smartwatch maker Pebble, it seems obvious that Fitbit is considering a deeper dive into the smartwatch market. The more important question is whether that's a smart move or not, with a recent report suggesting smartwatches will likely continue to struggle in the near term.
But just because the smartwatch category isn't working now doesn't mean it can't in the future with a “different approach,” according to co-founder and CEO James Park in an interview with The Verge earlier today.
“I draw an analogy with our own history at Fitbit,” Park said. “The closest device you could draw a comparison to [when we started] was a pedometer. And we came up with a radical new concept around activity trackers and really transformed that market, and grew it into something of a size that people couldn't imagine.”
To be clear, Fitbit hasn't explicitly said it is making a “real” smartwatch, one with more advanced capabilities than the is-it-or-isn't-it-a-smartwatch Blaze. But all signs point in that direction. First, the Pebble acquisition earlier this week: Fitbit has said more than once that it bought the company for its smartwatch software platform, not its hardware. Earlier this year Fitbit also acquired Coin, a payment-technology startup, as part of an effort to develop an “active NFC payment solution.” And on Fitbit's most recent earnings call, Park himself said the company was planning to expand into “new form factors” next year.
Fitbit says it plans to expand into “new form factors”
It was also in that same third-quarter earnings report that Fitbit forecasted a less-than-stellar holiday season, citing both production issues and a weakening demand for wearables. The report, and Fitbit's subsequent stock drop, was a giant reality check for the wearables industry: do people actually want these things?
“I can't really speak in detail about why others might not be finding success in the market, but we've always had our own view and conviction,” Park said when asked about the timing of the Pebble buy and where the smartwatch market currently stands. “But we don't think there's been any product out there in smartwatches that combine general purposes, functionality, health and fitness, industrial design, and long battery life into one package.”
Smartwatch makers are being tested in particular, with basic wristbands accounting for 85 percent of the global wearables market. Huawei, LG, and Lenovo's Moto decided to hold off on putting out new Android Wear smartwatches this fall. Apple just said that it had its best week ever of Apple Watch sales, and has called it a multi-billion dollar business for the company, but global research firm IDC estimates that Apple Watch sales, prior to the launch of the newest Watch, were down 71 percent year over year.
Park says he doesn't judge the usefulness of the whole category based on individual companies or products, and that part of Fitbit's goal is to have its product line “get more sophisticated over time.” And importantly, he said that the Pebble buy will help accelerate the development of a “great variety of apps we'll either develop on our own or with partners.”
Basically, by buying Pebble, Fitbit has bought into an independent smartwatch operating system, which means that it doesn't have to turn to Google's Android Wear if it wants to make a smartwatch, or build a new OS from scratch. Pebble, in its nearly five years of existence, managed to build up a store of 14,000 third-party apps and watch faces. Fitbit has third-party “integrations,” which means it shares data with other apps, but it currently doesn't support third-party apps on actual Fitbit devices.
Smartwatches still aren't must-have devices
Some analysts are still hopeful for the smartwatch market, too, despite what looks to be a significant bump in the road right now. Julie Ask, vice president at Forrester Research, says that while smartwatches are clearly a much smaller market than the smartphone and still aren't “must-have” devices, she predicts that the wearables category will be comprised of 40 percent basic trackers, 40 percent smartwatches, and 20 percent “other” wearable technology in the next four to five years.
“[Smartwatches] are getting much better at health and fitness. Prices will come down. And as things like mobile payments come into play, the perception of the utility will change,” Ask says.
She also notes, though, that having a bunch of third-party apps to run on your wrist isn't going to be the winning solution, either. “What we'll end up doing are app fragments, especially on complicated platforms,” Ask says. “Consumers just need something quick.”
The best way to do that, in Fitbit's view: buy an independent app platform like Pebble. The idea is not a bad one. The execution of it will be a different story.
Editor's note: A previous version of this article incorrectly said Pebble's app store had apps numbered in the single-digit thousands. The story has been updated with the accurate number.
My understanding is that the whole point of handwritten signatures is that they serve as evidence of a person's identity. Given that, it's critical that peoples' signatures not change drastically from signing to signing.
From the looks of it, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's official signature, soon to grace paper currency, is simply not valid. Just compare it to the signature he's been using up to now:
The one on the left is his signature as director of the Office of Management and Budget. The one on the right is his official Treasury signature. These are clearly not written by the same person. An impostor has taken over the Treasury Department, and readers are advised to not treat any currency bearing the right-hand signature as legal tender, at least pending further investigation into this tomfoolery.
Credit goes to Rebecca Leber for noticing this alarming development. Update: It appears the Wall Street Journal was the first to notice the plot at work here. Kudos to their team, especially Jeffrey Sparshott.
The scourge of Wall Street might have disappointed her legions of "Run Warren Run" supporters by ruling out her own bid for the White House earlier this year.
But the Massachusetts senator is in the thick of the Democratic race anyway. Warren offered a fresh glimpse of her political star power and talismanic value for Democrats when she held a furtive meeting with Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday -- which briefly knocked even Donald Trump out of the headlines.
The encounter, first reported by CNN, intensified speculation that Biden, perhaps encouraged by front-runner Hillary Clinton's ebbing poll numbers, is moving closer to a White House run and is keen to connect with Warren's fervent supporters.
Hillary Clinton launched her presidential bid on April 12 through a video message on social media. The former first lady, senator and secretary of state is considered the front-runner among possible Democratic candidates."Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead. And stay ahead," she said in her announcement video. "Because when families are strong, America is strong. So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey."
Ohio Gov. John Kasich joined the Republican field July 21 as he formally announced his White House bid. "I am here to ask you for your prayers, for your support ... because I have decided to run for president of the United States," Kasich told his kickoff rally at the Ohio State University.

Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate, solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP's establishment. He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23."These are all of our stories," Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia. "These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant."
Businessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White House."So, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again," Trump told the crowd at his announcement.
It also returned her name to the political mix, as Biden's interest in powwowing with her as he mulls a presidential run demonstrates her clout, and those same flagging poll numbers raise the specter of whether Warren missed her moment -- or might still plan to seize it and enter the 2016 race herself.
"Elizabeth Warren does have a thumb on the pulse of the progressive movement, the space that Bernie Sanders is occupying," said former South Carolina state lawmaker and CNN contributor Bakari Sellers on Sunday, referring to the Vermont senator challenging Clinton from the left.
New openings for Warren
The shifting dynamics of the Democratic race, reshaped by Clinton's rough start to an expected coronation now haunted by a controversy over her private email server, could yet offer new opportunities and leverage for Warren.
She insists, however, that she's not having second thoughts about her own decision to forgo a presidential run.
"No," "no" and "nope," Warren said unequivocally in a string of recent interviews with media organizations in her home state when asked whether she now feels she should have thrown her hat in the ring for president.
In many ways, the Democratic race for president is unfolding in Warren's ideological image anyway.
"People want to hear about the issues, they want to hear about change, they want to hear about how we take a system that is rigged and unrig it," Warren said in a weekend interview on WBZ-TV in Boston.
After Biden's meeting with Warren, his aides said the topic was mostly "economic issues" and not the election. But since Warren's push for raising taxes to create jobs, for clean energy, for affordable education, for infrastructure spending and against free trade deals undergirds the Democratic race, the conversation could hardly have been more political.
And the meeting was testimony to the power of Warren herself.

The fact that the sitting vice president would travel to Washington from Delaware just to meet her on a Saturday was a sign that Warren's weight in the Democratic Party outstrips her status as a first-term senator -- a lowly spot in a chamber where seniority rules.
Warren had already held a private meeting with Clinton late last year, which taken with the Biden talks offer proof that her standing has not eroded despite snubbing entreaties by her left-wing base to mount a presidential run herself.
Indeed, all the energy in the Democratic Party now is on the left, and she has exerted an ideological pull that is helping to shape the nominating showdown along the lines of a script she wrote herself on issues like banking regulation and student debt. Warren's eventual endorsement could prove an important moment in motivating base voters to support the eventual nominee.
Warren emerged from the Great Recession as a major political player, and conceived of and ran President Barack Obama's Consumer Protection Agency before running for the Senate. She is such a heroine to those on the progressive left of the Democratic Party that it's known among many activists as the "Warren Wing."
"We have seen a race to the top on Elizabeth Warren's ideas, including debt-free college, expanding Social Security, and holding Wall Street banks accountable," said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. "That dynamic would continue if Vice President Biden chooses to enter the race."
But Clinton and Biden, if he runs, would be seen as centrist Democrats associated with an administration with which Warren has sometimes clashed, and would need to make peace with the progressive left.
Sanders takes Warren's place
Many of the grass-roots Democratic activists who once hoped to fight for Warren have now gravitated to Sanders, a Vermont senator who has described himself as a socialist, injecting momentum into a populist, progressive campaign that has shown a surprising capacity to attract massive crowds and come within spitting distance of Clinton in some polls, given that he started the race in the single digits.
Sanders on Monday responded to Warren's meeting with Biden by calling her a "very good friend" whom he'd met many times. He then fired off the kind of acidic critique of the U.S. economic system for which she has become known.
"I think people understand there is something profoundly wrong today with establishment politics, that we need some bold ideas to resurrect the middle class in this country, to address poverty, to address income and wealth inequality," Sanders told reporters in New Hampshire.
Such is Warren's importance in the party that her every utterance is pored over by political strategists for evidence of veiled criticism of Clinton -- who faces a tough job in winning over progressives wary of the former secretary of state's ties to Wall Street donors who have helped underwrite her family's many campaigns and philanthropic foundation. Disappointment in Clinton still lingers over her Senate vote in 2002 to authorize war in Iraq and what some see as hawkish national security instincts.
In her campaign so far, Clinton has tacked to her left -- and toward Warren's positions on financial regulation and government programs aimed at making college debt-free. She has also criticized the Obama administration's plan to open certain areas of the Arctic to exploratory oil and gas drilling.
As part of an apparent bid to court Warren supporters, Clinton wrote a glowing tribute to the Massachusetts senator in Time magazine earlier this year.
"Elizabeth Warren never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street's irresponsible risk-taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished," Clinton wrote.
"And she never hesitates to hold powerful people's feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants."
But Warren is indicating that for now, no one has sewn up her support.
"I don't think anybody's anointed," Warren said, when asked on WBZ-TV if Clinton was already the de-facto nominee in an interview that aired on Sunday and caused stirs across the political world.
Still a party power broker
But while she looks set to wield great influence in the Democratic race, and could eventually help whoever becomes the nominee, disappointment still lingers for many Warren supporters who had hoped she would run for president in her own right.
While Warren has never explained exactly why she decided against a run, there are many possible reasons. Her lack of national security experience may have been a factor; she may have been wary of provoking the Clinton machine; she may have accepted a feeling among Democrats that it was Clinton's turn to finally make history as the Democratic Party's first female nominee.
Most polls earlier this year also suggested she would struggle to beat Clinton in a head-to-head race, given the former first lady's likely strength among Hispanic voters and minorities and the size of her political infrastructure.
Warren may have looked at the prospects and calculated that a failed presidential run could have undercut her influence.
Her political behavior since then and her decision so far not to play her top political card -- her endorsement -- may prove to be a shrewd move.
Not only is she preserving her capacity to influence candidates in the current campaign, she also appears to be seeking to cement an influence in the party that endures long past the 2016 election.
"She's a very important figure," said Jim Manley, a former senior aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
"Her modus operandi has been to hang back and let the process play out. She is playing the long game," he said. "I am not sure what the future holds for her, but I think she is determined to carve out a role within the party for many years to come."

Maybe the Libertarian Party did the Republicans a favor by nominating two successful former GOP governors, Gary Johnson of New Mexico and William Weld of Massachusetts, for president and vice president, respectively.
Yes, it is likely that the Johnson-Weld ticket will siphon many of its votes from Donald Trump. But it will also help test one of the theories for what has ailed the GOP as it lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections: The idea that a fiscally conservative party can excel at attracting voters once freed of its prurient obsession with bedroom politics and social issues.
Neither Johnson nor Weld is the purest small-l libertarian, although they are both individualists by inclination. But Weld's ideological transgressions are more numerous: He backed gun control and affirmative action in Massachusetts, seemed supportive of the Iraq war, championed a controversial use of eminent domain, signed a letter defending the Patriot Act, and, just this year, endorsed a Republican presidential candidate who argued for the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion by saying God doesn't care about small government.
Johnson didn't pick Weld to rally the Libertarian faithful. Instead the two-time Libertarian Party nominee implored the convention to ratify his choice of Weld for vice president in order to have a greater impact in the general election.
In the 1990s, Weld was the posterchild for the Republican Party's fiscally conservative but socially liberal future. First elected by beating a Democrat who was to his right on some social issues, Weld was staunchly pro-choice, going so far as to say ninth-month abortions were "a price I would pay to have government stay out of the thicket." He fought to remove the pro-life plank from the Republican platform.
Weld was also an early Republican champion of gay rights. He created the Massachusetts Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth. He signed an executive order allowing domestic partnerships for state employees at a time when most Democrats still opposed gay marriage, including the Clintons. He defended the court decision that led to same-sex matrimony in the Bay State.
For his trouble, in 1997 Weld was blocked from an ambassadorship by social-conservative stalwart Jesse Helms, who was then chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His social liberalism put a ceiling on his ambitions within the party.
At the top of the ticket, Johnson is somewhat to the right of Weld on abortion. But he is still ultimately pro-choice and has similar instincts on gay rights issues. He argued that "these religious freedom laws" proposed by social conservatives "are really just a way to discriminate against gay individuals, the LGBT community."
Want to know what the Republican Party would look like at the national level without the religious right? Johnson and Weld would give us an idea.
Yet there's a competing theory that the Republicans have been held back not by social conservatism but by their relative economic libertarianism. The party's reflexive commitment to free-market ideology leaves it with little to say to working-class Americans in financial distress.
As it happens, Trump tests this theory. He doesn't want to cut Social Security or Medicaid. He would repeal ObamaCare, but whatever he would replace it with would at least have a big enough government role to "not let people die on the streets for lack of health care." He opposes trade and immigration policies he regards as undercutting the wages and employment prospects of American workers.
Whatever one may think of Trump's sincerity as a social conservative, he has worked harder to appeal to evangelicals than budget-cutters or national-security hawks. He maintained his opposition to the Iraq war but moved, however imperfectly, in the direction of the Republican platform on abortion and has vowed to "protect Christianity."
Johnson and Weld promise to protect liberty without having much cultural affinity for the GOP base. Trump says he will defend the material interests of cultural red-staters who fall outside of the top income tax brackets.
It's not a perfect test, of course. Trump is the presumptive Republican nominee. Johnson and Weld represent a small third party. Even a disastrous Trump campaign will likely receive many more votes than a wildly successful Libertarian effort. The playing field between the present and former Republican leaders is hardly even.
But Trump is experimenting with a culturally conservative, populist, and nationalist party some on the right have always wanted, while Johnson and Weld are offering cosmopolitan fiscal conservatism, a version of the Wall Street Journal editorial page's tax cuts without borders.
What the mainstream conservative movement joined together, both the Republican and Libertarian presidential candidates will try and tear asunder in November.
The legendary mask actives were based on traditional japanese masks as well. All in all a fun flavorful monk.
Here is a list of WIP titles for the monk subclasses to come, as well as general design notes. Feel free to tell me if one in particular interests you and I can bump it up the release schedule. Most monks will require some polish before I'll show them off but I should be able to accommodate requests.
Hey guys, here's whats up. I will be releasing a bunch of monks, usually about once per day. Most of them are already mostly done, but I want some feedback on them before I make them into a compendium. Depending on feedback/popularity I'll work on polishing and reworking the best ones and wrapping them up with nice art into a compendium.
Way of the Fabled Facade
Masks of the Way of the Fabled Facade seek to replicate the oldest order of monks - Monks that appear in legends and fabled tales. They are able to channel their power with the help of a personal artifact, a simple mask, and use it to great effect. Advanced monks of this order develop a terrifying and mystical habit of appearing and dissapearing at a whim.
Legendary Masks
At level three, you gain a mask that use to connect to legends past and channel their fabled abilities. You gain proficency in the performance skill and the intimidation skill, and the benefits for the corrosponding mask. Chooose one mask:
Hunter: a gleaming white oni mask - Gain proficency in the Perception skill. You can use your bonus action to try to spot a weakness in a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. Make a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Stealth) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of your next turn.

Nightmare: a terrifying blue oni mask with horns - You have advantage on Intimidation checks. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Intimidation) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, the target is frightened until the end of your next turn. If your check fails, the target can't be frightened by you in this way for 1 hour.

You can use a bonus action to beguile an enemy creature to dissuade it from attacking you. When you do, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, they are charmed by you until the start of your next turn, and will not take hostile actions against you, but may target your companions.

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one attack with an attempt to deceive one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the target's Wisdom (Insight) check. If your check succeeds, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from the target and your attack rolls against it have advantage; both benefits last until the end of your next turn or until you use this ability on a different target. If your check fails, the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.
Once per short rest you can use your mask (no action required) to strengthen your connection with the legends. For one minute your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses skills granted by this feature. You can use Wisdom as the ability score for the skill check instead of whatever it was.
Theatrical presense
At 6th level, when you use your mask to strengthen your connection to the legends, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell that lasts until the end of your next turn, which does not require concentration or expend a spell slot.
You also can cast Utility spell corrosponding to your mask with the casting time of a minute. During this minute you can make a performance, and you can target any creature who watches your performance. Any creature who watches the performance also has disadvantage on the spell's save, if it has one.

Face Swap
At 11th level, you learn the disguise self spell, and you learn how to make more use out of your mask:
You can smear the blood or hair of an humanoid on your mask, which absorbs that humanoid's likeness. Those who see you while you are wearing your mask find you indistinguishable from the humanoid without resorting to magical means.
You can spend an hour of light activity embellishing your mask. Pick a creature type. Enemies of the chosen type have to make a Wisdom Save against the user to target them. If the user deals damage or casts a spell on any of the chosen enemies, the mask loses this effect.
You can create a mask from the corpse of a non-humanoid creature that has died in the last minute. After carving off parts of the creatures face, you can use an hour of light activity to fashion them to one of your masks- which absorbs its likeness. As long as you are the same size class as the creature, while wearing the mask you now appear to that race of creature as as an average individual. Your have advantage on social checks with creatures of that race.
Aura of the Unfathomable
At 17th level, you learn to traverse the world in an manner as inexplicable and uncanny as the legends your power draws from. You can tell if any particular location within 30 feet of you is in line of sight of a hostile creature. If you are out of line of sight of any hostile creatures you can teleport to any other location that is also out of line of sight. Each foot of this teleportation cost one foot of movement.
Dozens are protesting how American University responds to incidents of race after bananas were allegedly thrown at black students on campus. (WUSA 9)
Dozens are protesting how American University responds to incidents of race after bananas were allegedly thrown at black students on campus. (WUSA 9)
Hundreds of American University students gathered on campus Monday to demand the suspension of two white students who were allegedly involved in throwing a banana at a black woman in a dorm earlier this month.
Outside the university's student center on a gray afternoon, students voiced their outrage about the allegedly racial incident, one in what black student leaders said was a series of recent racially tinged problems on campus. The banana assault, which happened at about 1:30 a.m. Sept. 8, came the same night as another black student on the same floor of the dorm found a rotten banana outside her room and an obscene drawing on the whiteboard attached to her door.
[American University investigating after black student says banana was thrown at her]
The university's Black Student Alliance said in a statement last week that there have been racial tensions on campus for some time, including hate messages aimed at black students. On Monday, students spoke to the crowd via megaphone, saying these are not isolated concerns on the Northwest Washington campus and asking administrators to do more to protect students of color at the private university. Several students held signs, including one that read: “Racism at AU is bananas.”

Sophomore Ma'at Sargeant, one of the protest's organizers, said the banana incidents are part of a pattern. She and others asked that AU hire more faculty of color in the office of student life and alert the campus when racially motivated issues arise. “Nothing is ever done, no consequences, just town halls where we speak to deaf ears,” she said.
Racial issues on campuses nationwide have roiled students during the past year, setting off protests and in some cases forcing leadership and institutional changes as schools address their cultural climates. American University officials said they have been working to broaden the school's diversity and understanding among the community.
American University President Cornelius M. “Neil” Kerwin released a statement ahead of Monday's protest calling the banana incident and another unspecified “explicit racist incident” in a residence hall “unacceptable student behavior . . . that left our African-American students and others shaken, upset, and even feeling unsafe.” University officials declined to offer more details about the second incident, citing an ongoing investigation.
“Such acts are reprehensible and are the antithesis of the values and standards we embrace as a university,” Kerwin said. “I share with many of you deep disappointment and frustration that these events have disrupted our community and challenged our efforts to build an inclusive campus culture. They simply have no place here. We will confront racist expressions with forceful condemnation and respond to discrimination with every tool at our disposal.”
The incident involving the thrown banana was investigated and those involved “have been held accountable through the student conduct process,” Kerwin said in the statement.
“Do not be discouraged,” Kerwin said. “We will not be dissuaded from our goal to create a more inclusive climate.”
“Trump is innocent,” she said. “How do we know? Because he told us so. Period. Then he hired lawyers to agree with him. And they're going to prove it with a certified letter, which you know is the truth, because it costs an extra $2 to have it certified.”
As more and more of the correspondents asked her to consider the possibility that Mr. Trump was not being honest with her, Ms. McCarthy's character fell into an existential funk, and set off in search of the president.
In a filmed sequence whose creation was widely documented on Friday, Ms. McCarthy roamed the streets of New York riding a motorized White House podium (to the tune of Simon & Garfunkel's “The Only Living Boy in New York”). Told that the president does not come to Trump Tower anymore, she finds him at a New Jersey golf course — where he is played, as always, by Alec Baldwin.
As Mr. Spicer, Ms. McCarthy asked, “Have you ever told me to say things that aren't true?”
As Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin responded, “Only since you started working here.”
“Sean, kiss me,” Mr. Baldwin implored. “I'm famous, it's OK.”
Ms. McCarthy asked if it would be “like ‘The Godfather,' when you kiss me and no one ever sees me again?”

I have been involved in many debates with my friends about the merits of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as candidates for president. Research on gender and politics identifies issues that we need to keep in mind in these conversations. First, voting for a candidate for president simply because she is a woman is a perfectly legitimate position. Women voters' interests are better represented by female politicians. Second, if we think gender is irrelevant to our preferences, we need to examine our implicit biases carefully. As a mother of a 14-year-old daughter and as a scholar who works in a male-dominated profession, I think a lot about why voting for a female president really matters.
Descriptive representation matters
Political scientists spend a lot of time studying representation. Do women elect to Congress or state legislatures better represent issues that women voters care about, such as parental leave policies or reproductive rights? Do countries with more women in executive or legislative offices behave differently from countries with fewer women in these positions?
Political science research suggests that the answer to both questions is yes. Female legislators, especially Democratic officeholders, are more likely to sponsor bills for issues associated more clearly with female voters. Countries with more women in elected political offices have more peaceful foreign policies and better human rights practices.
So what difference would it make if we selected a female president? We would expect female voters to be better represented by the domestic and foreign policy agenda of a female president than a male president. Clinton, for example, has advocated very strongly for closing the wage gap between men and women, and it is not surprising that she is supported by groups like Planned Parenthood that advocate for women's issues. The president's ability to influence the legislative agenda could also affect the kinds of bills Congress would consider. The president's use of executive orders offers another avenue for women's issues to be addressed.
Female role models and political aspirations
Political scientists seek to understand why women are so under-represented in American politics. Women who run for office are not less successful than men who run for office. However, women are much less likely to put themselves forward as potential candidates for elected offices than their male peers.
Part of this dynamic stems from the lack of role models. When young women look at the presidency, Congress, or the Supreme Court and see few women in those political bodies, this discourages them from seeking such offices in the future. We see this at a more micro-level in the college classroom. A study conducted at the Air Force Academy found that female cadets performed significantly better in math and science classes taught by female rather than male professors.
We cannot change the dynamics of male-dominated environments until women break through the glass ceiling and inspire others to follow in their footsteps. My own career was strongly influenced by observing Madeleine Albright as secretary of state, Sandra Day O'Connor as a Supreme Court justice, and of course, Clinton as a senator and secretary of state. Having a female president is the next important glass ceiling to shatter.

Moving past implicit biases
Many of my friends claim that gender has nothing to do with their candidate preferences. Yet we see in recent polls a higher percentage of women supporting Sanders than the percentage of men supporting Clinton. This asymmetry in the gender gap can be understood by research on implicit bias.
For example, women used to be severely under-represented in major orchestras. When orchestras started using blind auditions where applicants played behind screens, the percentage of women accepted into these orchestras increased dramatically.
Experiments show many results where implicit biases influence subjects' behavior. If you take a resume and change the name from male to female, both male and female subjects will offer less pay to the hypothetical job applicant. Women are viewed as less competent leaders than male subjects in experiments.
In my own research, I find that women's research is less likely to be cited by male scholars in my field than published work by men. These kinds of implicit biases have long lasting effects in society including a gender wage gap and differential treatment of women in leadership positions.
While Clinton has a great deal of leadership experience in both domestic and international political arenas, many voters see her as being less competent than her opponents. Once you know more about how implicit biases affect our everyday lives, such an observation is not too surprising. We cannot recognize gender biases until we attempt to see gender in our everyday lives.
My hope is that no matter who my friends vote for in the end, that they will consider the role of gender in their decision-making more fully.

The benefits of living and working in green buildings run further than feeling good about their low environmental impacts. Many features encouraged by rating systems such as LEED, which promotes daylighting, access to views, and natural, non-toxic building materials, have proven to have a definite positive effect on health and well-being.
Proximity to Nature and Life Expectancy
Even if there is nothing “green” or sustainable about your home's construction, you can get a significant health boost just by being close to a park or green space. Japanese researchers found that living in a highly forested region can provide a protective effect against various types of cancer, including lung, breast, and colon. The correlation existed even when they controlled for smoking and wealth among participants.
Similar findings on the effect of green space were found in the U.S. at the University of West Florida and in Scotland at the University of Glasgow [1].
Natural Building Materials Decrease Stress
Natural building materials can make you feel more relaxed. Researchers found that for optimal relaxation effect, between 30 and 40 percent of the interior surface area should be covered by wood. Physiological stress markers were lowest in this range [1].
A Scenic View Improves Healing
Two groups of 23 hospital patients receiving gallbladder surgery were matched for all factors other than the type of view out their window; one group saw a brick wall, while the other group saw a natural scene of deciduous trees. The group that viewed the natural scene had shorter postoperative stays, took fewer potent pain killers, and received many optimistic assessments by the nursing staff [2].
Improve Mental Performance with Better Air Quality
A European study of 800 students showed that high carbon dioxide levels (indicative of poor ventilation) were statistically correlated with lower scores on a concentration test and a higher incidence of health complaints [3].
A study of adults in an office setting showed they performed slightly better in all tested categories of typing, arithmetic, logical reasoning, memory, and creative thinking when air quality was improved through increased ventilation [3].
Avoid Mold, Breathe Better
A well designed building will have fewer problems with excess moisture and mold. A Canadian study on nearly 15,000 adults found that the presence of mold in homes increased the number of respiratory complaints in both smokers and nonsmokers [4]. Another study concluded that mold exposure in homes worsened the symptoms of Asthma [5].
A Quieter Home for Calmer Nerves
Loud neighbors or surroundings can be annoying, but there are also physical health consequences. Noise increases stress levels, which can lead to hypertension and even heart disease. The World Health Organization published a report estimating that each year, noise pollution is responsible for the collective loss of 1.6 million years of healthy living among the European population [6]. The good news is that many green building features can help block out noise, such as using high performance windows, incorporating thermal mass into walls, and weatherstripping door and window frames.

Yabba dabba do, Seth MacFarlane will finally achieve his dream! The mastermind behind Family Guy will reboot the classic animated series The Flintstones for Fox.
Fox execs made the announcement at the network's presentation today in New York. The show will go in production this fall for a 2013 launch. “One of the first things I ever drew was Fred Flintstone,” MacFarlane told advertisers. As for his re-imagination, he said the show has to keep up with the times but some things will remain familiar for old fans. “The characters will look the same but the only thing that will change is the stories,” he said. “What's the [prehistoric] version of an iPod?”
Dan Palladino (Gilmore Girls) and Kara Vallow (Family Guy) will also serve as exec producers.
In case you've been living under a rock (d'oh!), The Flintstones follows two hard-working middle-class families living with the “contemporary conveniences” in the dinosaur-era town of Bedrock. The series centers on Fred Flintstone and his best friend and sidekick Barney.
Metastasized princess culture is responsible for all manner of social ills — the wedding-industrial complex, Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? (strong timely cultural reference), and holiday jewelry ads, to name a few. Probably land mines. Now, one ad campaign is aiming to stop The Princess Problem at the source: by telling girls that their lives aren't going to be all birds doing their hair and bland princes with brushes on the shoulders of their suit jackets. But that's not the most refreshing part: the entity behind the ads is a Catholic school.
Kentucky's Mercy Academy, an all-girls college prep school, is urging prospective students to "prepare for real life" and "learn how to rescue yourself." AdWeek calls this cool and refreshing, a progressive break from the sort of rhetoric a person might expect from a religious academy (although, nitpick: I was a practicing Catholic from the time my parents baptized me until I was in my mid-twenties, and I never remember emerging from CCD thinking, oh man, this religion is REALLY SETTING ME UP to be taken care of by a man who's gonna spoil me! But I digress.).
Is "You are not a princess" jarring? Sure. Fun-spoiling? Maybe. But telling girls that fairy tales aren't real isn't nearly as jarring and fun-spoiling as the realization that no human being's hair will ever be as fabulous as Ariel's hair was under the sea, nor will anyone's swept-aside bangs ever make that perfect gravity-defying side-wave so many of the princesses sport. Most little girls with princess dreams realize on their own that Mickey is a lying sack of mouse shit. But for those who don't, or haven't by the time they're starting to think about high school, this ad campaign is a helpful reminder.

The night before they were scheduled to host Corinthians FC of San Antonio in the opening round of the 2016 Lamar Hunt US Open Cup, the North Texas Rayados learned that they had been disqualified.
According to North Texas player/coach Tito Salas, the reason given by the US Soccer Federation was because the Rayados did not participate in the North Texas Premier Soccer League this past season due to injuries and player availability. In order to be eligible to participate in the US Open Cup, teams must be active in a USSF-sanctioned league.
“It's disappointing,” said Salas. “[We're] moving forward with a positive attitude. We plan to stay active active year-round. We'll learn from this.”
North Texas were planning to take part in their fifth straight US Open Cup, an open division record for the Modern Era, and were set to host a tournament game for the first time on Wednesday night.
The US Soccer Federation explained the decision in a statement:
U.S. Open Cup Policy 203(a) states in part: “Teams entering the Open Cup shall use their official league roster as their Open Cup roster.” Having skipped playing in their league's 2016 spring season, Rayados does not have any players currently registered with their league. With no existing league roster, the team has no eligible players for their 2016 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup roster.
According to US Soccer spokesperson Neil Buethe, the issue was discovered during a roster check with the North Texas Soccer Association. North Texas was eligible to compete in the open division qualifying tournament in the fall because they were active in the North Texas Premier Soccer League at the time. When the team pulled out of the league's spring season, that's what led to the disqualification.
Unfortunately for Corinthians FC, according to Jon Arnold, the team had already arrived in Dallas for Wednesday's game before they were alerted of the disqualification late Tuesday night.
With the decision, Corinthians FC gets a free pass into Round 2 where they will face the USL's San Antonio FC at Toyota Field on May 18 at 8 p.m. ET.
Corinthians are happy to move on, but they expressed their sympathies to their disqualified opponents:
Louisville City FC's supporters have no doubt had a two-game stretch of the 2017 season circled, first with anticipated Eastern Conference contender Tampa Bay before rival FC Cincinnati.
But coach James O'Connor's focus is always on the next game -- and only that game. Following a 2-1 win over the Rowdies, he was finally able to speak on Cincinnati ahead of a 7 p.m. Saturday matchup at Nippert Stadium.
“It'll be a very tough game for us,” O'Connor told reporters at his regular weekly press conference. “Intimidating atmosphere, but again a game we all look forward to. Great rivalry. Our supporters will be up there again. Hopefully in lots of numbers.”
FC Cincinnati drew a USL-record crowd for a season opener last Saturday when 23,144 witnessed a 4-0 win over Saint Louis FC. To add, former LouCity midfielders Aodhan Quinn and Kadeem Dacres now feature for the club's River Cities Cup rival.
“It'll be lovely to see Quinn and Kadeem,” O'Connor said. “They're two lads I really like and I wish them both all the very best. As I've said to them, just not when they're playing us. It's the same for them. They'll wish you all the best, just not when we're playing each other.”
(Update: Dacres received a straight red card Wednesday night and will not play against LouCity. Quinn rested and is expected to start.)
LouCity had the same scenario play out when striker Luke Spencer made the move from his hometown club to Louisville.
“I'm sure for Luke it'll be nice to go back,” O'Connor said.
Two weeks ago, former Richmond Kickers standouts Brian Ownby and George Davis IV suited up for LouCity in Virginia. Conor Shanosky, a former LouCity player, is now the Kickers' captain.
“I think as we start to develop as a club things like this will happen more and more,” O'Connor said.
Here's more from O'Connor's meeting with the media…
• On Speedy Williams' sub out of the Rowdies game: “We had a chat this morning. He's in less pain now then he was, so we'll just have to wait and see how that goes. We're hopeful that won't be anything too serious.”
• On facing a club with a large roster like FC Cincinnati: “The biggest thing for us always at this stage of the season is making sure our training is on point and we're focusing on the things we can control. We can't really control what happens in Cincinnati. How we train and how we prepare for games is what we need to focus on.”
• On George Davis IV's recent production: “When you look at his work ethic, his contribution to the game, and his goal, the goal alone is a major contribution. But when you look at his overall contribution, it was fantastic. I think his intensity to his work is great, so we've been really, really pleased with George. He's a great role model for everybody in the changing room. He trains really well and does all of the things that we ask of him. Really pleased with him to see him playing so well. Really, really happy with George.”
California metallers confirm they will begin work on their sixth album next month
Avenged Sevenfold have confirmed that they will be in the studio next month to record the follow-up album to their 2010 album ‘Nightmare'
Singer M Shadows confirmed to NME that their sixth album is almost ready to record: “This album's a little more groove orientated,” he said. “There's a little bit more groove to it, a little bit more focused on bigger riffs. So that's where it's headed – every song has gotta have a huge riff and every song has to have a groove to it.”
The California metallers have also written a new song called ‘Carry On', which appears on Call Of Duty Black Ops II and features the band performing the song as digital characters during the end credits.
Speaking about the game, M Shadows revealed that the band were “really honoured to be made into, you know, immortalised on a video game”. He added: “At the same time, it's really cool that it's on the Call Of Duty game 'cause we're big fans of the game.”
Scroll down to watch the video of Avenged Sevenfold in Call Of Duty Black Ops II.
Avenged Sevenfold released their debut album ‘Sounding The Seventh Trumpet' in 2001. It was followed up by 2003's ‘Waking The Fallen', 2004's ‘City Of Evil', and their 2007 eponymous fourth album. The band's last release ‘Nightmare' came out in 2010.
Jarome Iginla isn't calling foul on Montreal Canadiens blue-liner Alexei Emelin.
The Colorado Avalanche forward didn't question whether the hit by Emelin late in the game of Saturday's 10-1 blowout to the Canadiens was a clean hit.
To Iginla, it's all part of the game.
"At that point of the game when they're beating us like that, it's not really a matter of whether it's clean or not," Iginla told Mike Chambers of The Denver Post. "(I) just don't think (it's right). If I'm going up-over like that with two minutes left and down 10-1, I'd hope guys are coming in (for me). That's the way I've played and I think that's the way it should be played."
Iginla was held pointless on the night, while posting one shot and four penalty minutes through 11:47 of ice time.
"They can do the hit if they want," Iginla added. "It's part of the game. But we are allowed to do what we do too. That's what penalty minutes and stuff are for."
Frederick Sanger, the two-time Nobel Prize winner, died on Tuesday at the age of 95:
It was remarkable what he accomplished in his career:
Dr. Sanger won his first Nobel Prize, in chemistry, in 1958 for showing how amino acids link together to form insulin. The discovery gave scientists the tools to analyze any protein in the body. In 1980 he received his second Nobel, also in chemistry, for inventing a method of “reading” the molecular letters that make up the genetic code. This discovery was crucial to the development of biotechnology drugs and provided the basic tool kit for decoding the entire human genome two decades later.
… Raised as a Quaker, he was a conscientious objector on religious grounds during World War II and remained at Cambridge in those years to work on his doctorate, which he received in 1943. Later in life, however, he became an agnostic, saying he lacked hard evidence to support his religious beliefs. “In science, you have to be so careful about truth,” he said. “You are studying truth and have to prove everything. I found that it was difficult to believe all the things associated with religion.”
The reason I bring this up is because the New York Times included an interesting tidbit in his obituary:
That seems to be the case quite often in fields where the ability to think critically and back up your ideas with solid evidence are premium requirements for success.

Fasting. So risque. So controversial. Some people think it's freaking weird, some people love it, and some people call it anorexic. Either way, I wanted to try it. I wanted to try a 24 hour fast because I never had. So many paleo bloggers talk about intermittent fasting and how much they love it, so I thought I'd give it a try.
Intermittent fasting times range from just a couple hours to multiple hours. I chose the ladder. There are a balls ton of benefits out there, none of which I care a ton about, I mainly just wanted to see if I could mentally do it and see how my digestion would feel after. No, I didn't weigh myself. That's not what I really care about. People just rave about sleeping better and mental clarity and better wods, so why not? So I did it. 24 hours of fun on Sunday. Making 3 meals…not consuming any of them….hilariously fun. But it surprisingly didn't bother me.
So here was the run down. I woke up, had some tea, did a disgustingly brutal wod that pissed on me and laughed at me, then coached a couple classes, did my grocery shopping, drank water to confuse my stomach (best tasting water I've ever had), cooked for hours, watched the Food Network, worked on my computer, drank more tea, and then finally got to eat at night. Thank.Goodness. But I was surprisingly not that hungry. I ate a small meal and was satisfied.
So this is what I learned from fasting. I don't mind it. It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be after the morning hunger pains went away. It made me feel like my food from the previous day was digesting a bit better. And it helped me control my food instead of my food controlling me. I tend to eat when I'm not hungry because I just really like food and the happy endorphins I get when I eat, so controlling my consumption was needed. I also did notice that I slept a lot better than usual. I went to bed around 11:30 and woke up at 1:30 feeling super rested and happy to be able to go back to sleep, then woke up at 4:30 to get ready for work and was super alert the rest of the day. Who knows if that had to do with the fasting or if I was just excessively hyper like I usually am, either way I was loving it. So will I try fasting again? Surely. Maybe a couple times a month. Nothing crazy. I like doing things that I'm good at. And I'm good at eating. Really good at it.
That was kind of a boring story. Wanna hear a good story? Of course you do! I made pecan coconut butter over the weekend. Genius idea. Overloading fat happiness, that's what that is.

US Treasury chief and wife, previously criticised for how they spend money, are pictured admiring sheet of new bills
The US Treasury chief, Steven Mnuchin, has sparked a wave of criticism and mockery after photos appeared of him and his wife, Louise Linton, holding up a sheet of new dollar bills.
Mnuchin was visiting the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to see production of the new dollar bills, which will bear his signature for the first time.
The couple have previously been targeted for the way they spend money.
They were heavily criticised in September when it emerged that he had asked for the use of a US air force plane to fly him and his wife around Europe for their honeymoon.

Linton apologised in the same month for an Instagram post earlier in the year, in which she had tagged a series of designer clothes producers in an image of her stepping off a government plane.
Responding to comments underneath the post, Linton replied to a post saying: “Glad we could pay for your little getaway” with the questions: “Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country?”

The PKK terrorist organization has resumed assassination plots targeting Kurdish political figures who refuse to adhere to its brutal policies, killing two members of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in two days in southeastern Turkey. Two AK Party district deputy heads have been killed in Turkey's southeastern province of Diyarbakır and the eastern province of Van in two separate incidents. AK Party deputy district head Orhan Mercan was shot in an armed attack in front of his home by armed PKK terrorists in Diyarbakır's Lice district. The AK Party's district head İsmail Demir, said Mercan was immediately taken to Lice Hospital for treatment but succumbed to his injuries.
His body will be transferred to Diyarbakır for an autopsy, according to reports. "Initial findings point to PKK militants as being the perpetrators of the attack," Demir noted. In a separate incident, PKK terrorists abducted Aydın Ahi, AK Party deputy head of the Özalp district in eastern Van province, from his home. More than 10 bullets reportedly struck Ahi before he died. Police have launched an investigation to capture the perpetrators. The PKK terrorist organization has intensified assassinations targeting politicians since its attempts to target urban areas were thwarted last year as a result of successful counterterror operations and the lack of cooperation from locals in the region.
Mercan and Ahi are not the first politicians to fall victim to the PKK, as two other district-level politicians were also consecutively killed last year.
Deryan Aktert, the head of the AK Party's Dicle district headquarters in southeastern Diyarbakır province, was shot dead by PKK terrorists at his workplace in October 2016.
A day before Aktert's assassination, Aydın Muştu was found dead in his home after being ambushed by PKK terrorists in Van's Özalp district, where he served as deputy head of the AK Party's district branch.
In the wake of the killings, the leader of the PKK, Murat Karayılan, claimed responsibility and threatened other administrators and politicians in the region with death.
Along with politicians, civil servants are also frequently targeted by the PKK in Turkey's southeastern region.
Necmettin Yılmaz, a 23-year-old teacher in Turkey's southeastern Şanlıurfa province, was killed by the PKK in Turkey's eastern Tunceli province, according to a statement from the terrorist organization Wednesday.
On June 9, PKK terrorists killed another young teacher, Aybüke Yalçın, in a terrorist attack as she was traveling in a car with her colleagues in the southeastern province of Batman.
Also, Muhammet Fatih Safitürk a district governor who was appointed to the Derik district in Mardin province was killed by a bomb that had been planted in his office in November 2016.
The PKK's Syrian offshoot, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), which is backed by the U.S. under the guise of fighting Daesh, applies the same strategy in northern Syria, brutally suppressing all critical voices and Kurdish movements apart from itself.
The PYD terrorist group has forced the migration of Arabs and Turkmens, conducting arbitrary arrests targeting Kurdish voices critical of the PKK while also recruiting child soldiers, drawing intense criticism and wide coverage from international human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch (HRW), Amnesty International and Kurdish Watch.
The terror organization targets rival political voices, taking retaliatory action in the form of arson, arbitrary arrests and kidnappings, to the ire of Kurds in northern Syria who have voiced concerns.
The Kurdish National Council (KNC) in Syria has been a critical voice against the arrests and abductions carried out by the PYD.
The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and EU, resumed its decades-long armed campaign against the Turkish state that has been ongoing since 1984. An estimated 40,000 people in Turkey have died in terror-related violence since then, including 150 school teachers.
Southeastern and eastern Turkey are particularly prone to PKK attacks and along with military and police officers, a large number of civil servants and civilians have been killed in armed ambushes, car bombings and roadside bomb attacks.
VANCOUVER — An appealing aspect of the Canadian Football League has long been the idea that many of its players are paid like ordinary working stiffs, and make a lot less than some.
This week — as the sports news is full of the gut-punch National Football League fans in St. Louis have taken, now that multi-billionaire Rams owner Stan Kroenke has jettisoned that city in favour of Los Angeles — there is another reason to be grateful for football loyalty on a humbler scale.
That reason: nobody ever owned a CFL team hoping to get rich. Or richer.
The league's two wealthiest franchises, Saskatchewan and Edmonton, are community-owned. Of the others, the goal is to break even, maybe make a buck or two, or at least not lose a bundle.
A few owners might even be called philanthropists. Bob Young in Hamilton and David Braley in Vancouver and Toronto have done nothing less than rescue desperate franchises from ruin. Bob Wetenhall in Montreal and Jeff Hunt in Ottawa brought football back from the dead in those cities.
Say what you want about Braley recouping some of his losses with Grey Cups before he leaves the stage; I'd like to have someone show me how he comes out with a net profit after the years he spent propping up money losers.
The Calgary Flames didn't buy the Stampeders nor Larry Tanenbaum and MLSE invest in the Argos entirely out of the goodness of their hearts, but is there any doubt they stabilized franchises that were in iffy financial shape?
Contrast that with what just happened in the mad scramble by three National Football League teams — St. Louis, Oakland and San Diego — to be first to get to Los Angeles, and all the back-stabbing that went on behind the scenes before Tuesday night's owners vote to side with the guy who has the most money (shocking).
There is no more helpless feeling, for a fan base, than being held hostage by an owner who uses the fans' emotions against them, which is why St. Louis may be the saddest of all abandonment stories. The city and state had agreed to pony up $400 million toward the cost of a new stadium for Kroenke, even though the existing stadium, the Edward Jones Dome, which was also built for Kroenke's Rams with public money, was only 20 years old.
Oakland and San Diego weren't going to fund new playpens for the Raiders and Chargers with no questions asked, yet the NFL chose to uproot from the only city of the three that was yielding to the owner's threats.
In the end, the league couldn't resist Kroenke's $2 billion-plus plan to build a stadium complex in Inglewood on the site of the old Hollywood Park racetrack that was once the property of former Argos owner Harry Ornest.
Sure, CFL fans in most markets have been through the wringer with “Save Our (team name here)” campaigns, but the threats were never “or else we're moving to The Big City” — they were, “or else we'll have to cease operations.”
At least a few of those places have also seen the hammer wielded, far less kindly, by National Hockey League owners angling for a better deal, with little subtlety about what they'd do if they didn't get it (or in Winnipeg's case, what they did do in 1996, relocating the old Jets to Phoenix).
Edmonton in the 1990s had prospective buyers of the Oilers wheeled into town to try to bully the city, and Calgary currently is getting the full Gary Bettman shaming treatment for failing to get on board with a billion-dollar arena/stadium proposal. Hamilton was used repeatedly as a pawn in NHL teams' relocation threats.
Maybe CFL owners would be that venal if they ever had a plausible alternative destination to wave in their cities' faces, but it's doubtful.
They got in the game with their eyes wide open. All the Canadian cities that have stadiums already have teams and the idea of building one in a place like Atlantic Canada where fans may be clamouring for a franchise has kept coming up against economic reality for more than 30 years now.
Those who think it was fair ball for Kroenke to move the Rams the moment his lease ran out in St. Louis say that at least he's using his own money in L.A., forgetting that whatever it costs him to move and build is but the tiniest fraction of what he made in profits from the hearts of the St. Louis faithful for two decades of pretty paltry returns on their love.
It's a good lesson, if a hard-earned one, for fans of teams in leagues where inflating franchise value is the end game and all other considerations are trivial.
The CFL, poor cousin though it may be, asks nothing more than to make a modest living, right where it is.

The Miami Heat came into the 2015-16 season as one of the more hyped and yet completely enigmatic teams after their offseason facelift. With the additions of Gerald Green and Amar'e Stoudemire along with the retention of both Goran Dragic and Dwyane Wade, plenty of pundits handpicked Miami as Cleveland's prime adversary in the East.
However, after a hot 12-6 start in which the team played a league-leading 13 of 18 games at home, Miami has faltered recently, due mostly to their poor shooting, mismatched lineups, and turnover rate.
In a revamped league landscape in which the rest of the NBA is hoisting and making threes at a historic rate, the Heat attempt just over 19 threes per game (for comparison, the league-leading Rockets put up more than 31 threes per game) and convert their three pointers at the third lowest rate in the league.
2014-15 3P% 2015-16 3P% Gerald Green .354 .309 Luol Deng .355 .310 Goran Dragic .347 .315 Justise Winslow* .418 .216
*2014-15 College Numbers
As you can plainly see, many of Miami's shooters have simply failed to make their perimeter shots at the rates they had in just the previous season, and it's hurt the team in more ways than one. Without legitimate perimeter threats, other teams have been able to crowd the paint, leaving the team with the league's 10th worst turnover ratio per possession.
The Miami Herald's Ethan Skolnick summed up the Heat's shooting difficulties best, citing the fact that the team is shooting 35.2% from three in their 12 victories and just 26.2% from three in their nine losses before Sunday's last-minute win against the Grizzlies.
With the team shooting so poorly from outside, it's no wonder a player like Hassan Whiteside, inexperienced in the post as it is, has had an uptick in turnovers as the spacing and room to maneuver in the paint has become more and more constricted with opponents respecting Miami's outside shooting less than ever.
While many of Miami's offensive struggles lie on the three-point line, they certainly don't stop there. The team's $85 million man Goran Dragic, has been a monumental disappointment both inside and outside the paint this season.
Dragic 2014-15 Dragic 2015-16 Catch and Shoot Less than 10 ft Catch and Shoot Less than 10 ft 38.8% 64.9% 33.3 % 59.3
As one of the team's few transition options, Dragic's catch and shoot prowess and ability to finish at the rim has been sorely missed. Not only is Dragic shooting worse around the basket this season, he's also averaging almost two fewer shots at the rim per game.
It's been readily apparent to anyone watching that the Slovenian international simply hasn't been the world-class finisher at the rim that he's been in previous seasons, regularly missing straightforward layups by his standards.
Another foreboding facet which has obviously hampered the Heat offensively has been their oft-mismatched offensive lineups. One need look no further than Miami's starting group to see the disparate play styles featured on the team.
On one hand you have the speedy Dragic, constantly looking to get out and run in transition, while alongside him is Dwyane Wade, who in his reinvention, has become more of a halfcourt, pick & roll and post-up option.
It seems all too often Dragic races up the floor in transition, only to kick the ball out to an unwilling shooter who pump fakes as the offense slowly fades into yet another lazy dribble handoff or pick and roll set, ultimately settling for a contested jump shot.
Coach Erik Spoelstra has also sat center Hassan Whiteside in the fourth quarter of each of the team's last three losses, due in part to the small-ball lineups of their opponents, begging the following questions: If the team intends to compete as a throwback featuring a traditional big man, why bend to the whims of the opponent? If the opposition goes small in an effort to force Miami's bigs out of the paint on defense, then why not take advantage of Whiteside's size mismatch on the offensive boards, especially when the team's smaller lineups are unable to consistently convert threes, anyway?
If Miami is to truly compete in the East, the team is going to have to find their shooting touch either within the roster or with a trade for a proven perimeter shooter. In this evolving NBA landscape, the Heat simply cannot afford to stay complacent and shoot the three and turn the ball over at some of the league's worst rates. Unless able to improve in these facets, Miami may once again be left behind in a much-improved Eastern Conference.

Jon Steitzer may be moving on from the Nations Network, but his consolidated draft rankings were such a useful little tool for looking at where exactly all of the top prospects stand in the eyes of the scouts that I knew I had to keep the tradition going. So I made my own.
To do this, I took seven different top 30 lists from prominent publications – Damien Cox of Sportsnet, Craig Button of TSN, International Scouting Services (ISS), Future Considerations (FC), McKeen's Hockey, Draftbuzz Analytics (DB), and the Draft Analyst (DA) and looked at who was ranked where on their various lists. Then I put all the lists together by assigning a prospect ranked 1st 30 points, a prospect ranked 2nd 29 points, a prospect ranked 3rd 28 points, and so on. Naturally, a prospect ranked 30th received 1 point. A prospect not ranked received no points.
The method may not be totally perfect, but it still gives us a fairly good look at what the consensus opinion is on all of the top prospects for the draft.
I should also note that, in order to keep up with constantly-changing rankings, only lists published since the start of March were taken into consideration. That means the lists of Bob McKenzie, Corey Pronman, and Hockey Prospect have all been excluded, as none of them have released a new list consisting of at least 30 players since the start of March.
So without further ado, here's the list:
Our list aligns closely with Bob McKenzie's recent post-lottery top 15. This isn't surprising given that McKenzie polls a range of scouts and puts the lists together – in other words, he uses a consensus draft rankings of his own.
Just for fun, here's what our list would look like if we applied it to the top of the first round:
1. Auston Matthews – Toronto Maple Leafs
2. Patrik Laine – Winnipeg Jets
3. Jesse Puljujarvi – Columbus Blue Jackets
4. Matthew Tkachuk – Edmonton Oilers
5. Pierre-Luc Dubois – Vancouver Canucks
6. Alex Nylander – Calgary Flames
7. Jakob Chychrun – Arizona Coyotes
8. Olli Juolevi – Buffalo Sabres
9. Mikhail Sergachyov – Montreal Canadiens
10. Clayton Keller – Colorado Avalanche
11. Michael McLeod – New Jersey Devils
12. Tyson Jost – Ottawa Senators
13. Logan Brown – Carolina Hurricanes
14. Jake Bean – Boston Bruins
15. Luke Kunin – Minnesota Wild
16. Julien Gauthier – Detroit Red Wings
Here's the specific breakdown of each publication's list:
First and foremost, these rankings essentially back up the idea of a “top three” consisting of Auston Matthews, Patrik Laine, and Jesse Puljujarvi. There also looks to be a second cluster of three right after them consisting of Matthew Tkachuk, Pierre-Luc Dubois, and Alex Nylander.
Also of note is the fact that there's a fairly big drop-off after the 12th-ranked Tyson Jost, with a lot less consensus on which players belong where starting with Logan Brown (granted, Craig Button's uncharacteristically low ranking of Brown skews this a bit).
We also see that, at this point, there only appears to be 20 or so real consensus first-rounders. The variance among the publications about who deserves to be seen as a top 30 players in this draft is wide, with 48 total players being ranked within the top 30 – and that's using only seven lists.
Here are the players that didn't crack the top 30 that were ranked at least once on these lists:
Brett Howden (16 points, ranked two times)
Sam Steel (15 points, ranked three times)
Dillon Dube (14 points, ranked one time)
Libor Hajek (14 points, ranked three times)
Boris Katchouk (10 points, ranked two times)
Taylor Raddysh (9 points, ranked two times)
Jonathan Dahlen (7 points, ranked one time)
Adam Mascherin (7 points, ranked one time)
Mitchell Mattson (7 points, ranked one time)
Nathan Bastian (6 points, ranked one time)
Kale Clague (6 points, ranked two times)
Tyler Benson (5 points, ranked two times)
Carl Grundstrom (5 points, ranked two times)
Ben Cholowski (4 points, ranked one time)
Adam Fox (4 points, ranked one time)
Lucas Johansen (3 points, ranked one time)
Jacob Moverare (2 points, ranked one time)
Cam Dineen (1 point, ranked one time)
It'll certainly be interesting to see how these lists changes as the various publications prepare to release their final rankings with the NHL draft only a month and a half away. In particular, for better or for worse, things like the World Championships, the Memorial Cup, and the Draft Combine are all bound to shape various opinions in subtle ways.
Whatever the case, it should be a very fun few weeks leading up to arguably the most important two-day period on the NHL calendar.
Whenever Tim Murray discussed the trade of Mark Pysyk for Dmitry Kulikov, he was quick to point out the other piece of the deal. The former Sabres general manager picked up the No. 33 selection in the 2016 NHL Draft while giving up Nos. 38 and 89.
Buffalo drafted Rasmus Asplund, and Murray felt the center would be the key piece of the trade. The Sabres will have to wait at least another year to find out.
Asplund will remain in Sweden for another season, he told Värmlands Folkblad, a Swedish news service. He said he discussed the decision with new Sabres GM Jason Botterill.
“It's very turbulent in Buffalo right now, considering that they will have new coaches in both NHL and AHL,” Asplund said, according to Translate.Google.com. “They want to have as many contract places as possible as they get together both NHL and AHL troops. And because I would not have played in NHL or AHL next season, there's no need to mess up now.”
NHL teams are limited to 50 contracts per season. The Sabres are at 29 heading into free agency and the draft, according to CapFriendly.com.
The 19-year-old Asplund has played three professional seasons in his homeland. He had six goals and 19 points in 39 games this year for Farjestads BK Karlstad, then added three assists in five playoff games.
During international competitions, the 5-foot-11, 183-pounder has centered for fellow Sabres prospect Alex Nylander. Asplund had six assists and seven points in seven games at this year's world junior championship while serving as alternate captain.
According to LawNewz, the Trump administration is now regularly using a term that has rarely been used by the federal government since 2009:
There has been a shift in the language that the U.S. Department of Justice is using in its press releases and official announcements, and it's not sitting well with some. The DOJ, under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has begun using the term “illegal aliens” to refer to immigrants who do not have the proper paperwork to be in the United States.
Under Obama, the de rigueur term was “undocumented” which sanitized what was going on. As the Chicago Tribune complains:
[I]n the July 9, 2014, announcement, “Department of Justice Announces New Priorities to Address Surge of Migrants Crossing into the U.S.,” then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole chose such language as “migrants,” “asylum seekers” and “unaccompanied minors.”
Naturally, a lot of people who aren't fans of Sessions are displeased:
“They're using a legally inaccurate term that's deployed to unfairly label and scapegoat people who are out of status due to a variety of systemic circumstances,” Xakota Espinoza from the Center for Racial Justice Innovation, told LawNewz.com
…
“The i-word is legally inaccurate, politically loaded, dehumanizing to the people it describes and likely unintentionally fuels racial profiling and violence directed toward immigrants,” Espinoza explained.
Department of Justice referring to people here as what they are, illegal aliens, brings a level of clarity to the issue that had been obscured in a cloud of legalese and motivations.
David Moore and David Ermold, whom Kim Davis denied a marriage license. Most Americans side with Moore and Ermold over Davis. David Moore
Shortly after the Supreme Court brought marriage equality to every state, the AP released a troubling poll: 49 percent of respondents believed local officials with religious objections should be exempt from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while just 47 percent thought they should be required to follow the law.
That, of course, was before the Kim Davis brouhaha. Over the last month, Davis' refusal to issue marriage licenses—on account, she says, of her religious opposition to same-sex marriage—has dominated the news cycle. Davis appeared to be a terrible poster girl for the cause of anti-gay “religious liberty”: Even principled conservatives turned against her after she violated a federal court order and displayed brazen contempt for the rule of law. In early September, I hypothesized that Davis' stand might be a gift for the gay rights movement, since she so insolently revealed the raw animus that lies beneath the cynically misleading “religious liberty” campaign. But others, like the Atlantic's Emma Green, speculated that Davis might actually bolster the “religious liberty” movement by giving it a sympathetic martyr.
On Tuesday, an ABC News/Washington Post poll revealed the most significant post-Davis data point yet—and the results don't look good for Davis and her admirers. An overwhelming 74 percent of respondents believed that when a conflict arises between religious beliefs and equal treatment under the law, equality should win out. Moreover, 63 percent of respondents said that Davis should be required to issue marriage licenses despite her sincerely held religious beliefs. (That tracks an earlier Rasmussen poll, which found that 66 percent of Americans think Davis should follow the law and issue licenses.)
Notably, a majority of only two groups thought Davis should be exempted from issuing licenses: evangelical white Protestants and self-identified “strong conservatives.” That view was also more common among Republicans, less well-educated people, and lower-income Americans. Democrats, well-educated people, and higher-income Americans widely believed Davis should not defy a federal court order and refuse to do her job.
It's obviously impossible to conclude from this data alone that Davis hurt the “religious liberty” movement. In fact, there's no surefire way to know whether the plunge in support for people like Davis is a reaction to her fight or just a broader acclimation to gay equality. Still, the new poll cannot be encouraging for those conservatives who have struggled to elevate Christians' right to discriminate over gay people's right to equal dignity. Kim Davis showed Americans what happens when someone values religion over the rule of law. If this poll is any indication, they didn't like what they saw.
Thought Scour: PucaTeam talks Future Site WRITTEN BY Aaron Lee
When you are in the minutia of a project, seeing the forest for the trees can be hard. Developers are elbow deep in code while graphic designers are focused on the look and feel. Making sure the two go together can be a challenge.
The PucaTrade team has been working nearly nonstop over the past eighteen months to bring you the most inclusive MTG trading platform in the world. After all that hard work, it's all coming together.
In this Thought Scour I wanted to find out what our team is most excited about for Future Site and what they feel will be the feature our members like the most.
"What is the one feature you are most excited about using in Future Site
and what feature do you think PucaMembers will enjoy the most?"
Eric Freytag - Founder
For me, it's "Package View" all the way. I did the work of importing 20,000 cards into my collection, so being able to sort my available packages by quantity and value is going to be a HUGE timesaver.
I think our members will most enjoy the vastly-expanded inventory that we've opened up with support for new cards (digital, condition and non-English cards). Many of us on Team Puca (myself included) geek out over the delightful user experiences we've baked into Future Site, but we're also aware that, fundamentally, our members use PucaTrade as a tool. And the main criteria people have for tools is that they work.
Chris Powell - Senior Developer
The thing I'm most excited for is MTGO trading. It's really amazing to be the first trading site ever to bridge the gap between paper and digital trading!
Personally I only do drafts on MTGO, so I have tons of commons and uncommons from all the most recent sets. I'm hoping to not only get event tickets to draft but start picking up cards to complete sets and do the redemptions (especially Khans of Tarkir). Who knows, maybe I will even dabble in some Constructed queues.
I think members will enjoy package trading the most. Our members love to get maximum value on a stamp (I know I do). It will be so much easier to commit, ship and complete trades. You will now only have to write down 1 trade number, ship 1 package and, on the other end, complete 1 trade.
Dan Miller - Operations Lead
The Future Site feature I'm most excited about is the new package trade support. It perfectly fits the way I use Puca: sending out piles and piles of cheap cards. Really, I'm just trying to make room in my collection for new draft chaff to rotate in, so my package threshold is incredibly small. Being able to sort by members who want the most cards? Amazing. I'm going to need more toploaders.
I think PucaMembers are going to have a lot to look forward to on the new site, but maybe the most universal new feature will be our refined search system. Whether or not you're logged in, you'll have access to improved search filter functionality which is really cool. Having access to an even more granular set of search options is going to be fantastic for deck builders and collectors alike; and the search from anywhere ability is just crazy convenient if you spend any amount of time on Puca.
Vinnie Balistreri - Director of Marketing
I'm most excited for non-English trading. Chasing down playsets of cards in hard to find languages has been a task for me in the past. The thrill of the hunt makes the reward sweeter, but I would much rather just sit back and wait for someone to send me Russian Wanderwine Hubs.
The feature that will be the most loved, I think, will be package trading. It's been requested for as long as I've been part of the PucaTrade team. If you haven't yet I'd suggest getting as much of your collection onto PucaTrade in order to make the most of this feature. I know I'll be spending this week powering through boxes of uncommons and commons hoping to snag some large packages at launch.
Package trades win the race! Personally, I am excited out of my mind for package trades and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. In our next Thought Scour we are going to be hearing from some of our Top Traders.
