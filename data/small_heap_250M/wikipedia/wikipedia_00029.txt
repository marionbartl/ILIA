Van Asch Deaf Education Centre was located in Truro Street, Sumner, Christchurch, New Zealand. It was a special school for deaf children, accepting both day and residential pupils, as well being as a resource centre providing services and support for parents, mainstream students and their teachers in the South Island and the Lower North Island (south of Taupo).
The school was founded in 1880. Formerly called the Sumner Deaf and Dumb Institution, Sumner Institution for Deaf-Mutes and Sumner School for the Deaf, the school was renamed in its centenary year as van Asch College in honour of its first Principal, Gerrit van Asch.
In 2019, the New Zealand government decided to merge the school with Kelston Deaf Education Centre in Auckland to form one national school. This national school was named Ko Taku Reo.
History
Prior to 1877, there was no state assistance for educating deaf children in New Zealand. Wealthy parents could send their deaf children to schools for the deaf either in Australia or England or else privately hire a teacher to come out to New Zealand. Dorcas Mitchell was one such teacher who had trained in England to teach in sign language and then come to New Zealand to teach the four deaf children of Rev. Bradley, at Charteris Bay, in Lyttelton Harbour, certainly before 1870.
On 29 November 1877, the New Zealand House of Representatives enacted the Education Act 1877, which provided for free primary education for all children aged between 5 and 15 in New Zealand from 1 January 1878. Education was compulsory for non-Maori children between 7 and 13 but exceptions could be made for sickness or infirmity and children could be expelled for disruptive behaviour.
Establishment
William Rolleston, when he represented the electorate in 1878, proposed a school for deaf children in Parliament. The motion was agreed and the Government agreed to add funds to the supplementary estimates to establish an Institution for the deaf in Christchurch. This was the first time in the world a government had funded a residential school for educating people who were deaf, so could not speak.
Recruitment of a teacher
In November 1878, Sir George Grey, Colonial Secretary, wrote to Julius Vogel, then the Agent-General for New Zealand, in London, to recruit a suitable teacher from England. Upon seeing news of this correspondence in the Lyttelton Times, Dorcas Mitchell wrote to Grey seeking appointment and indicating she had intended to establish her own school for deaf-mutes. The Secretary of Education, John Hislop, visited Miss Mitchell in Lyttelton in March 1879 to see her proposed school, which he thought unsuitable. It soon became apparent that the school would be also be associated with an orphanage, which Rolleston felt was not what Parliament intended. Nevertheless, in June 1879, the Government assisted Miss Mitchell investigate other possibilities in Dunedin and Oamaru.
Appointment of the first director
In June 1879, Vogel informed Grey that Gerrit van Asch had been selected as the Institution's first Director. Van Asch, who was born in 1836 and had been specially trained in Holland and Germany in the Pure Oral method, before moving to England in 1859 to establish private schools for educating deaf mutes by spoken language and lip-reading only. The commissioners reported he was the only applicant, of seventeen, who was trained in the German system system, teaching lip-reading, speech, writing and reading concurrently. They also noted he also spoke English "without an accent". Of the other applicants, the Commissioners reported that 12 men were trained to teach with sign, and 3 men had no special training. (No mention was made of the abilities or gender of the remaining applicant.) He emigrated to New Zealand in October 1879 and selected the Sumner site temporarily, with intentions to move to a larger population center in the future.
Commencement
The Institution for the Deaf and Dumb opened for "training and instruction of deaf-mutes" in Sumner on 10 March 1880. By June 1880, the school had 10 students and grew to have 37 students, including one from Australia, as well as 4 teachers, by the end of 1885. From January 1886, the Institution for Deaf-Mutes, as it was by then known as, leased "Sumner College", a large five-year-old building that had been erected as a boarding school by Mr. C. L. Wiggins, in order to accommodate its growing roll. From the beginning Van Asch was enthusiastic to demonstrate his teaching methods to the many visitors to the school and they were amazed by the results. In his response to the 1886 report, the Minister of Education observed that the "deaf are seldom dumb". In 1888, an assistant teacher from the Sumner Institution, who was visiting schools for the deaf in other countries to see their teaching methods, was giving evidence before a Royal Commission into the Education of Deaf-Mutes, in London.
Compulsory attendance
The School Attendance Act 1901, which was enacted on 7 November 1901, required children who were deaf or blind be given "efficient and suitable" education between the ages of seven and sixteen. Parents who could not do so were obliged to send their children to an "Institution" that the Minister of Education directed the child attend. The requirements were carried forward into the 1904 consolidation and reprint of the Education Act. In practice, this required parents to enrol their deaf children at the Sumner institution, or else educate them privately and at their own expense.
Retirement of the first Director
Director van Asch retired at the end of March 1906. Miss van Asch, his daughter, who had taught at the school for 17 years also retired.
School for the Deaf
At the end of his report for the 1907 year, the new Director, J. E. Stephens, observed that the school's official title was misleading and requested that "The School for the Deaf" be used instead.
In 1958, the Boy's House was burnt down in the early hours of the morning.
The old main building was centred near the hills and Evans Pass.
Oralist beginnings
The Milan Congress of September 1880 resolved it was best to use Oral education for the deaf. Although this method of deaf education was not universally supported, with some British and American educators of a contrary opinion. In 1980, the 15th International Congress on the Education of the Deaf (ICED) held in Hamburg, West Germany, repudiated 1880 resolutions.
Oral education persisted up until the late 1970s, the philosophy of the school was to prevent the students from using sign language (now New Zealand's third official language). Children were taught exclusively via oral methods, forcing them to learn to lipread and speak, with punishments being given for use of sign language.
Nevertheless, school student also acquired sign language from some of the adult support staff, who were also deaf, as well as older pupils and their peers in various social settings away from the classroom and not supervised by their teachers.
Mainstreaming
From 1966, some deaf students were educated in a deaf classroom at Sumner School, the nearby state primary school with the intent of socializing deaf student into a hearing school and familiarising students of the two schools with each other. The inter-change of students and teachers between the two schools continued in the 1970s and 1980s and was considered a positive experience by all concerned.
Bilingual teaching
In the late 1970s, the school switched to bilingual teaching and currently, in addition to presenting the curriculum in NZSL, Sign Supported English and oral (aural) modes, the college now offers the facility for deaf and hearing-impaired students being educated in mainstream settings to learn about NZSL as part of a Deaf Studies curriculum.
2011 Christchurch earthquakes
After the Christchurch earthquakes in February and June 2011 made the old Redcliffs School site unsafe, the van Asch Deaf Education Centre hosted the 400 pupils and staff for nine years pending a decision to close or rebuild that school. Eventually a new site was found and the school building were rebuilt in Redcliffs Park on Beachville Road, across the road from the original site, and the school moved to its new site on 22 June 2020.
Merger
In 2012 the Boards of Trustees of the van Asch Deaf Education Centre and Kelston Deaf Education Centre combined to become a single board running both schools. On 9 April 2019, as a result of a request by the Combined Board of both schools, the Minister of Education announced that van Asch Deaf Education Centre and Kelston Deaf Education Centre would merge in 2020 at the beginning of the third term and become one national school to support more than 2700 deaf or hard of hearing children and students up to the age of 21 in the New Zealand Education system. In 2020, van Asch became a residential campus and support centre for Ko Taku Reo.
Deaf staff
The employment of deaf gardeners, cooks and cleaners has been credited with having a significant effect on the transmission of signs between generations, with children picking up signs the auxiliary staff used to communicate with each other, despite disapproval from teaching staff.
In 1992 the Board of Trustees had its first deaf chairperson.
In 1993 the first Sign Language tutor was employed.
In 1997 the first deaf teacher was employed.

Bug is a play by American playwright Tracy Letts. It was adapted as a film of the same name in 2006. Letts wrote the screenplay and Michael Shannon reprised his role as Peter.
Synopsis
Most of the play takes place in a seedy motel room. Lonely cocktail waitress Agnes lives there, hiding from her violent ex-husband Jerry Goss, an ex-con. One night, her lesbian biker friend R.C. introduces her to Peter, a Gulf War veteran who might be AWOL. She gets involved with Peter, who grows increasingly paranoid about the war in Iraq, UFOs, the Oklahoma City bombing of the federal building, cult suicides, and secret government experiments on soldiers. He eventually draws Agnes into his delusions. The play explores issues of love, paranoia, conspiracy theories, and Agnes's slow descent into insanity under Peter's influence.

A film version of the play was released in 2006 from Lionsgate. It was directed by William Friedkin, and starred Ashley Judd, Harry Connick, Jr and Michael Shannon. Friedkin contacted Tracy Letts after having seen the play, and they cooperated on a screen adaptation. Friedkin described the film as "the most intense piece of work I've ever done". Michael Shannon had played the part on stage. Lionsgate wanted to cast an actor with more name recognition, but Friedkin was determined to have Shannon perform in the film, saying he brought a unique quality to the part.

The 2009 CAF Champions League is the 45th edition of Africa's premier club football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and the 13th edition under the current CAF Champions League format. The winner will participate in the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2010 CAF Super Cup.
Qualification
53 teams from 40 CAF member associations were entered officially in the 2009 CAF Champions League.
The 12 highest ranked associations according to CAF 5-Year Ranking are eligible to enter 2 teams in the competition. For this year's competition, CAF used 2003–07 5-Year rankings in which 3 countries shared the 12th place – allowing 14 countries to enter a second team.
Two other teams were entered after the official deadline and were placed in a special subsection on the draw.
Below is the qualification scheme for the competition. Nations are shown according to their CAF 5-Year Ranking – those with a ranking score have their rank and score indicated:
Italicised clubs withdrew without playing.
Bolded clubs received a bye in the preliminary round, entering the tournament in the first round.
Unranked associations have no ranking points and hence are equal 23rd (Malawi – ranked =18th – did not enter a champion this year).
1 The champions of Congo DR, South Africa, Sudan, and Tunisia were not given byes in the first stage although the runners-up were. Unlike European tournaments, seeding within the CAF draws is based on performance in continental tournaments only.
2 The 2007–08 Egyptian Premier League runner-up, Ismaily opted not to enter this competition, choosing instead to play in the 2008–09 Arab Champions League. The third-placed Egyptian side, Al-Zamalek were not allowed to replace them as the CAF Champions League regulations allow only national champions and runners-up to compete.
3 2008 Réunion Premier League Champion, JS Saint-Pierroise, banned from African club competitions after withdrawing from the 2007 CAF Champions League.

Timo Hoffmann (born 25 September 1974) is a German professional boxer and multiple-time European heavyweight title challenger. He is perhaps best known as being the only fighter for nearly a decade (from 2000 to 2009) to have gone the full distance against Vitali Klitschko. He holds notable wins over Corey Sanders, and Ross Puritty. He fought but did not beat the aforementioned Vitali Klitschko, Francois Botha and Henry Akinwande
Amateur career
As an amateur Hoffman won a silver medal at the 1992 Junior European Championships in Edinburgh, Scotland and a bronze medal at the 1992 Junior World Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and had 86 amateur fights.
Professional career
Hoffman turned professional in 1997 and won his first 22 bouts.
In 2000 he suffered his first loss to Vitali Klitschko but managed to go the full 12 rounds with the hard-hitting Ukrainian. This was the first and for nearly a decade a last occasion that someone went to the distance with Klitschko, until Kevin Johnson managed to achieve the same feat in late 2009. Hoffmann was then upset on his next fight by Michael Sprott.
Hoffmann never fought for a major world title throughout his career, but he held various smaller titles for some periods. His notable opponents included Henry Akinwande, Luan Krasniqi, Paolo Vidoz, Timor Ibragimov and Alexander Dimitrenko. He last fought Francois Botha in 2009 and lost the fight by split decision. His record as of December 2009 stands at 38 wins, 7 losses and one draw.

Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter is a 1986 album by the American singer Billy Eckstine, accompanied by the alto saxophonist Benny Carter. The singer Helen Merrill appears in duet with Eckstine on the first and last songs of the album. This was Eckstine's only LP released on Verve Records, and marked his final album recordings.
Eckstine was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Male at the 30th Grammy Awards for his work on the album.
Reception
Scott Yanow reviewed Billy Eckstine Sings with Benny Carter for Allmusic and wrote that "Billy Eckstine's final recording (although he would live until 1993) finds the 72-year-old singer showing his age. Mr. B's famous baritone voice at this late date only hints at his earlier greatness although his phrasing and enthusiasm uplift what could have been a depressing affair." Yanow felt that Carter "...still sounds in his prime on alto" and praised his trumpet solo on "September Song". Eckstine's biographer Cary Ginnell also noted the deterioration in his voice, writing that "...he had by now lost most of his lower range...[his] jazz instincts were still evident, but his chops were gone".

Quantal response equilibrium (QRE) is a solution concept in game theory. First introduced by Richard McKelvey and Thomas Palfrey,
it provides an equilibrium notion with bounded rationality. QRE is not an equilibrium refinement, and it can give significantly different results from Nash equilibrium. QRE is only defined for games with discrete strategies, although there are continuous-strategy analogues.
In a quantal response equilibrium, players are assumed to make errors in choosing which pure strategy to play. The probability of any particular strategy being chosen is positively related to the payoff from that strategy. In other words, very costly errors are unlikely.
The equilibrium arises from the realization of beliefs. A player's payoffs are computed based on beliefs about other players' probability distribution over strategies. In equilibrium, a player's beliefs are correct.
Application to data
When analyzing data from the play of actual games, particularly from laboratory experiments, particularly from experiments with the matching pennies game, Nash equilibrium can be unforgiving. Any non-equilibrium move can appear equally "wrong", but realistically should not be used to reject a theory. QRE allows every strategy to be played with non-zero probability, and so any data is possible (though not necessarily reasonable).
Logit equilibrium
The most common specification for QRE is logit equilibrium (LQRE). In a logit equilibrium, player's strategies are chosen according to the probability distribution:
is the probability of player choosing strategy .
is the expected utility to player of choosing strategy under the belief that other players are playing according to the probability distribution . Note that the "belief" density in the expected payoff on the right side must match the choice density on the left side. Thus computing expectations of observable quantities such as payoff, demand, output, etc., requires finding fixed points as in mean field theory.
For dynamic games
For dynamic (extensive form) games, McKelvey and Palfrey defined agent quantal response equilibrium (AQRE). AQRE is somewhat analogous to subgame perfection. In an AQRE, each player plays with some error as in QRE. At a given decision node, the player determines the expected payoff of each action by treating their future self as an independent player with a known probability distribution over actions. As in QRE, in an AQRE every strategy is used with nonzero probability.
Applications
The quantal response equilibrium approach has been applied in various settings. For example, Goeree et al. (2002) study overbidding in private-value auctions, Yi (2005) explores behavior in ultimatum games, Hoppe and Schmitz (2013) study the role of social preferences in principal-agent problems, and Kawagoe et al. (2018) investigate step-level public goods games with binary decisions.
Most tests of quantal response equilibrium are based on experiments, in which participants are not or only to a small extent incentivized to perform the task well. However, quantal response equilibrium has also been found to explain behavior in high-stakes environments. A large-scale analysis of the American television game show The Price Is Right, for example, shows that contestants behavior in the so-called Showcase Showdown, a sequential game of perfect information, can be well explained by an agent quantal response equilibrium (AQRE) model.
Critiques
Non-falsifiability
Work by Haile et al. has shown that QRE is not falsifiable in any normal form game, even with significant a priori restrictions on payoff perturbations. The authors argue that the LQRE concept can sometimes restrict the set of possible outcomes from a game, but may be insufficient to provide a powerful test of behavior without a priori restrictions on payoff perturbations.
Loss of Information
As in statistical mechanics the mean-field approach, specifically the expectation in the exponent, results in a loss of information. More generally, differences in an agent's payoff with respect to their strategy variable result in a loss of information.

Patrick Chan Siu-oi () is a judge in Hong Kong. He currently serves as a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal having previously been a Permanent Judge of that court.
Early life, education and legal career
Born in Hong Kong, Chan attended Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, a prominent Jesuit high school in Hong Kong. He received his Bachelor of Laws ("LLB") degree in 1974 and a Postgraduate Certificate in Laws in 1975 from the University of Hong Kong. He served pupillage under Patrick Yu and was called to the Hong Kong Bar in 1976. He was a barrister in private practice until he joined the Judiciary as a District Judge in 1987.
Judicial career
Between 1987 and 1991, Chan served as judge in District Courts, having been appointed a District Judge on 9 November 1987. In 1991, he was appointed Deputy Registrar of the Supreme Court.
In 1992, he began serving as a Judge in the Court of First Instance of the High Court of Hong Kong.
Chan was appointed the first Chief Judge of the High Court in 1997, when British colonial rule in Hong Kong ended and China resumed its sovereignty over the region. He thus became the first locally educated judge to hold that position.
In 2000, he was appointed a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong's court of last resort). He retired in 2013 and was succeeded by Joseph Fok. He continues to serve as a Non-Permanent Judge of the Court.
During his time on the bench, Chan contributed significantly towards the development of a bilingual legal system, and served on various judicial committees advocating the greater use of Chinese in judicial proceedings and the translation of English judgments.
In February 2021, Chan claimed that there is no absolute separation of powers in Hong Kong, and that "It is more accurate to call it a division of authority."
Extra-Judicial Life
From October 2006 to September 2012, Chan was a member of the Law Reform Commission of Hong Kong.
Chan was appointed an Honorary Bencher of the Inner Temple (England and Wales) in 2001. He was conferred Honorary Fellowships by the University of Hong Kong (2003) and the Chinese University of Hong Kong (2011). He was conferred with an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the City University of Hong Kong (2008) and an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Hong Kong (2011).
In 2013, Chan was awarded the Grand Bauhinia Medal, the highest honour given by the HKSAR Government.
Chan has been recognised for his contributions to legal education in Hong Kong. He was the Chairman of the Joint Examination Board on Postgraduate Certificate in Laws set up to ensure that a common standard would be maintained for postgraduate law students of both the University of Hong Kong and the City University entering the legal profession.

Fuddy Meers is an American play by David Lindsay-Abaire. It tells the story of an amnesiac, Claire, who awakens each morning as a blank slate on which her husband and teenage son must imprint the facts of her life. One morning Claire is abducted by a limping, lisping man who claims her husband wants to kill her. The audience views the ensuing mayhem through the kaleidoscope of Claire's world. The play culminates in a cacophony of revelations, proving that everything is not what it appears to be.
Production history
The play premiered Off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theatre Club, running from November 2, 1999, to January 2, 2000 and transferred to the Minetta Lane Theatre on January 27, 2000, closing in April 2000 after 16 previews and 78 performances there. The play was directed by David Petrarca and featured J. Smith-Cameron (Claire), Marylouise Burke (Gertie) and Patrick Breen (Limping Man).
The play was nominated for the 2000 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Play (J. Smith-Cameron) and the John Gassner Award (David Lindsay-Abaire), and won the 2000 Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actress (Marylouise Burke).
The play premiered in the West End at the Arts Theatre as the first play produced by Sam Mendes' production company, "Scamp", in 2004, as a co-production with
Birmingham Rep and Fiery Angel's Edward Snape. Directed by Angus Jackson, the cast featured Julia Mackenzie (Gertie), Katie Finneran (Claire), John Gallagher Jr. (Kenny), Matthew Lillard, and
Nicholas Le Prevost. The play had a pre-West End engagement at the Birmingham Rep from April 16, 2004 to May 8.
Background
Lindsay-Abaire wrote the play while a student in the Juilliard School Lila Acheson Wallace American Playwrights Program. The play had a staged reading as part of the National Playwrights Conference at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in 1998 under Artistic Director Lloyd Richards.
The play's title, "Fuddy Meers", is Gertie's (who has had a stroke) attempt to pronounce the phrase "funny mirrors".
Characters
Claire – about forty, a generally sunny woman with amnesia.
Richard – about forty, a chatty, friendly, sometimes nervous man.
Kenny – seventeen, a troubled teen.
Limping Man – about forty, lisping, limping, half-blind, half-deaf man with secrets unknown to anyone else.
Gertie – sixties, a clear-headed lady who's had a stroke and can't speak properly.
Millet – thirties or forties, an odd man with a puppet.
Heidi – thirties or forties, a tough woman in uniform.
Synopsis
Claire awakens one morning to discover that she is married to a hospital worker named Richard and has a son, Kenny, who has an attitude problem. She learns she has a "psychogenic" form of amnesia, and Richard gives her a book he prepared about her life after re-explaining everything so many times. Everything is as it seems until Zach, or "Limping Man" as he is referred to in the script, appears from under the bed. He claims he is there to rescue Claire and that Richard wants to kill her.
Zach, who 'reveals' he is Claire's brother, takes her to their mother Gertie's house. Gertie is not fond of Zach but cannot say why because of her aphasia. While there, Claire meets Millet, a kind man with an apparent mental disability and a bad-mouthed puppet. It is revealed that Millet and Zach have escaped from prison, although why they were brought to prison remains a mystery.
Meanwhile, Richard takes Kenny to search for Claire. He is pulled over by Heidi and takes her gun, bringing her with him and Kenny as they travel to Gertie's house. But in the meantime Millet – through his puppet – has told Claire about how her husband used to beat her, and she wants nothing to do with Richard. She has also found out that the real Zach, her brother, is dead. As Richard, Kenny and Heidi are entering the house, Claire does not know whom to trust. Gertie takes advantage of the opportunity and stabs Limping Man.
In the ensuing chaos, Kenny is shot in the arm with Heidi's gun and a flurry of revelations comes forth. Limping Man is in fact Phil, Claire's abusive ex-husband, while Richard is her new husband. Richard has a criminal past and had framed Millet for stealing an expensive ring. Heidi meanwhile turns out to be a prison cook who met Phil during his time in prison. Claire's world (as well as that of the audience) becomes increasingly clear with each new revelation as she regains more and more of her memory and realizes she is responsible for Limping Man's deformities.
Ultimately, Limping Man's plans are foiled by his love for Claire. We find that Heidi was posing as a police officer to stop Richard and Kenny from reaching Claire, but when Limping Man professes his love for Claire, Heidi turns her back on him. Millet leaves to clear his name, Heidi and Limping Man presumably go to jail, Gertie is safe, and Richard, Kenny and Claire leave in Richard's car. The final act reveals yet another twist.
As Claire talks about updating her memory book, Kenny's negative attitude towards Richard becomes more understandable when the true nature of Claire and Richard's relationship is revealed. Kenny tells of how Richard worked at the hospital where Claire was staying and proposed to her on a daily basis, taking advantage of her memory loss. Apparently, in his attempt to reform his criminal past, he was desperate for companionship; however, all that matters for Claire is that the trio are a family now.
Reception
The production was acclaimed, with sold-out audiences and mostly positive critical reactions, with the New York Times, New York Magazine and Variety among its proponents. John Simon, in his review for New York Magazine "declared that Lindsay-Abaire was Ionesco's 'true heir' (November 8, 1999)." Ben Brantley, in his review of Lindsay-Abaire's play Rabbit Hole for The New York Times, noted: "With works like "Fuddy Meers" and "Kimberly Akimbo," Mr. Lindsay-Abaire established himself as a lyrical and understanding chronicler of people who somehow become displaced within their own lives." In his review of the 1999 production, Brantley wrote that the play was "dark, sweet and thoroughly engaging comedy... Mr. Lindsay-Abaire blends cliched ingredients into something savory and distinctive, with scarcely a tinge of residual staleness... The production is willfully silly and grotesque, yet there's a cool, satisfying strategy in its piecing together of its jigsaw puzzle of a plot." John Heilpern, drama critic for the New York Observer wrote: "Mr. Lindsay-Abaire, a manic farceur with an original mind, surprises us all the way to the nut house and receives my Most Promising Dramatist Award, bummer though it is to be labeled 'promising.'" (Heilpern awarded Lindsay-Abaire the "Heilpern Award for Most Promising Dramatist" in 1999.)
However, while critics were pleased with the humorous content, one critic noted the "loose ends" The CurtainUp reviewer wrote: "If you like your plays neat and orderly, with everything progressing in logical order, Fuddy Meers is not for you. Its prevailing mood is manic, its characters tend towards oddball bizarre. The plot spins wildly out of control with Act 1 ending in total bedlam. However, if you're ready to suspend belief and simply enjoy an imaginative mind at work, you'll have a belly-full of laughs."
Five years after its debut, it had been produced at over 200 venues across the United States.
The play was nominated for the 2000 Outer Critics Circle John Gassner Playwrighting Award.
Reactions were mixed when Sam Mendes launched the first British production of the play. The reviewer in The Guardian pointed to Arsenic and Old Lace and You Can't Take It with You as examples that Americans (in his opinion) had a tradition of works "in which wackiness was a sign of liberating individualism", but that "...it means little to us here." The play also debuted in a traditionally-weak theatre season for London's West End and it closed after only three weeks. Though Fuddy Meers was later produced elsewhere in the UK, it never saw the same success it had seen in North America.

The history of the Jews in Kyrgyzstan is linked directly to the history of the Bukharian Jews of Uzbekistan. Until the 20th century, most Jews living in the Kyrgyz areas were of the Bukharian Jewish community. However, during the 20th century, large amounts of European Jews began to emigrate to Kyrgyzstan which was then part of the Soviet Union, and a small amount of them still live in the country.
Archeological findings suggest that Jewish traders from Khazaria started visiting the Kyrgyz territory around the 6th century CE.
In Kyrgyz tradition, the term "Djeet" was used in order to describe Jews, and it is mentioned in the Kyrgyz epic poem Manas, which dates back to the 10th century CE. In Manas, several central-Asian cities are described as having Jewish communities in them, among them Samarkand, Bukhara and Baghdad, though non of them have ever been inhabited by a majority of Kyrgyz people nor included in a Kyrgyz territory.
According to a census held in 1896, the Jews represented about 2% of the region total population. It can be assumed that almost 100% of these Jews were Bukharian Jews or at least Sephardic Jews, meaning no Ashkenazi Jews were living in the Kyrgyz area before the 20th century. During World War II many Jews fled from the European parts of the Soviet Union to central Asia, including Kyrgyzstan, making the Jewish community of Kyrgyzstan combined out of an Ashkenazi community and a Bukharian Sephardic one. The two communities functioned separately and though it did occasionally happen, Ashkenazi–Sephardi intermarriages were not common.
Bukharan Jews
Bukharan Jews, also known as "Bukharian Jews" or "Bukhari Jews" are Jews from Central Asia who speak Bukhori, a dialect of the Tajik language. Their name comes from the former Central Asian Emirate of Bukhara, which once had a sizable Jewish community. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the great majority have emigrated to Israel and to the United States, while others have emigrated to Europe or Australia.
Medieval period
In his memoirs, Marco Polo mentions the existence of Jewish traders along the silk road which passed through modern day Kyrgyzstan, who built synagogues and spoke Aramaic. Famous Arab geographer Al-Maqdisi (946−1000) mentioned the cities of Osh, Uzgen, Taraz and others as having communities of Jews.
Modern period
Ashkenazi Jews first arrived to Kyrgyzstan with its conquest by the Russians. In the city of Karakol, one Jew was recorded in 1885. By 1900 there were seven Jews in the city and by 1910 the city had 31 Jewish inhabitants. While in 1885 Bishkek had eight Jews, by 1913 there were 43 Jews in Bishkek. The city of Osh had the biggest amount of Jews in Kyrgyzstan prior to the 20th century, due to its Sephardic Jewish community, which even had its own Jewish cemetery outside the city.
During the beginning of the 20th century, numerous Jewish Businessmen owned businesses in the Kyrgyz area − among them Yuri Davidov, who owned cotton factories in the Fergana valley, Boris Kagan who established a network of bookshops, and the Polyakov brothers who founded a branch of the "Azov-don commercial bank". Due to the need in doctors, teachers and engineers, many Ashkenazi Jews began to emigrate to Kyrgyzstan from European Russia.
Religious life
It is known that the Jewish community of Osh bought its Torah scrolls from its neighboring community of Uzbek Bukhara.
Until 1915, there were no synagogues in Kyrgyzstan. The nearest one was in Verniy, nowadays Almaty in Kazakhstan, Tashkent, Samarkand and Fergana in Uzbekistan. A separate Jewish cemetery operated only in Osh, while in all other cities Jews were buried in separate areas of the general Muslim/Christian cemeteries.
While there was no Jewish education in Kyrgyzstan, some of the Sephardic Jews in Osh sent their children to learn at the Heder in Samarkand. Ashkenazi Jews did not practice Judaism publicly, and sent their children to Russian schools.
After World War I
After World War I, more and more Ashkenazi Jews came to Kyrgyzstan. Among them many representatives of different political parties who were exiled to central Asia, or government officials who were asked to work in rural areas such as Kyrgyzstan. With the
outbreak of the Communist revolution, many political activists were sent to Kyrgyzstan to promote the communist ideas − many of whom were Jews or of Jewish origin, such as G. Broido who was chairman of the Bishkek city soviet, and Pinchasov, Lifschitz and Frei who were members of the local city soviets of Osh, Djahlal-Abad, and Tokmak. In 1920 the local ministry of education initiated a Jewish institute run by Simon Dimanshtein meant for alphabetization of Sephardic Jews. In 1929, Alexander Volodarsky, a former Yeshiva student from Vitebsk, became the leader of the Ashkenazi Jewish community of Osh, after being exiled from Belarus due to his religious practices.
World War II and on
During the Second World War, more than 20,000 Ashkenazi Jews fled to Kyrgyzstan from the Nazi-occupied western parts of the Soviet Union. The Jewish Theater Company of Warsaw with the renowned actress Ida Kaminska (1899−1980) was evacuated to Bishkek until it was moved back to Europe after the war. During that time, the theater performed in Bishkek in Yiddish and Russian.
By 1945, some 70 Jews of the Bishkek community visited the local synagogue daily. On holidays, some 2,500 Jews visited the synagogue. Later, the synagogue began to host also Sephardic prayers for the city's Sephardi community. During the 1950s, the Jewish community of Bishkek reached about 3% of the total population of the city. Jews became dominant in the local university, clinics and schools, living mostly at the center of Bishkek. On other cities, smaller communities of Jews had lived also in the center mostly.
During the 1970s, some Jews began to emigrate to Israel, though the Soviet government made it hard for them to emigrate. Later on, and especially from 1989 and on, the vast majority of the Kyrgyzstan Jewish community emigrated to Israel, leaving around 500 Jews living nowadays in the country.
In 2000, Rabbi Arie Reichman, member of Alliance of Rabbis in Islamic States was sent by the Chabad movement to serve the Jewish community of Bishkek as Chief Rabbi, and nowadays there is a Jewish day school named "Pri Etz-Chaim", teaching some Hebrew and Jewish texts. The community is characterised by inter-religious marriage, and secular practice.
Cemeteries
Jewish graves can be found at the Bishkek old and new cemeteries, in specific sections. Local cemetery workers usually know about these areas. In Djhalal-abad, at the local cemetery, Jewish graves are scattered all around the cemetery, marked usually by the Magen David sign.

The maritime industries of Taiwan are a large part of Taiwan's economy. Industries of particular importance are shipbuilding, boat building, maritime transport, aquaculture, mariculture, commercial fishing, seafood processing, offshore wind power and various forms of tourism. Deep sea mining, especially of dormant hydrothermal vents, is also being considered for the future. In 2018 Taiwan was the fourth largest yacht building nation. Taiwan is home to a number of maritime museums and maritime colleges.
Background
Taiwan is an island nation and as such as an intimate relationship with the sea. Seafarers from Taiwan are believed to have colonized the Ryukyu Islands 30,000 year ago. The indigenous Yami people of Orchid Island are famous for their seafaring skills and most Taiwanese indigenous people practiced some right or ritual related to the sea. Waves of immigrants and conquerors have traveled to Taiwan over the seas from Mainland China, Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. The people of Taiwan are collectively known as the "Children of the Sea.”
The principle goddess of chinese folk religion as practiced in Taiwan is the sea goddess Mazu. Her veneration is particularly popular along Taiwan's east coast.
Geographically Taiwan's relationship with the sea is shaped by its location at the eastern end of the Eurasian landmass. The east coast is under the influence of the strong Kuroshio Current. The west coast of Taiwan is muddy with large tidal flats, tides in the west are much stronger than those on the east and as such they have a much greater influence on daily routines.
The Ship and Ocean Industries R&D Center (SOIC), founded in 1976 as the United Ship Design and Development Center (USDDC), plays an important role in supporting Taiwan's maritime industries. SOIC works on commercial, government, and military projects as well as basic scientific research. The Yacht Industry Department of SOIC is the only government supported R&D center for yacht materials and design in the world.
Taiwan's maritime culture suffered under the KMT who nationalized the seashore and closed off access to most Taiwanese as well as forbade private recreational boat ownership. This led to an extreme disconnect between the island nation and the waters which surround it. As late as 2010 half of all Taiwanese did not know how to swim. Since the end of the martial law period the Taiwanese people have embarked on a process of re-embracing their maritime culture.
Sea transport
As of 2009 90% of Taiwan's trade was seaborne. Evergreen Marine and Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation are two major ocean shipping companies based in Taiwan. Wan Hai Lines and Today Makes Tomorrow are smaller but still globally significant ocean shipping companies. In 2016 amid a global downturn in the shipping industry the Taiwanese government spent $1.9B to support the domestic shipping industry.
As of 2019 Taiwan had the 11th largest national shipping capacity by deadweight tons.
Ports
Taiwan's main ports are located in Taipei, Keelung, and Kaohsiung. Most of the nation's large ports are managed by Taiwan International Ports Corporation which is a state-owned enterprise.
Shipbuilding
The modern shipbuilding industry of Taiwan began in 1948 when the Government established the Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation (TSBC) in Keelung. In 1957 the US based Ingalls Shipbuilding Corporation established the Ingalls Taiwan Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which subsequently rented the TSBC shipyard and produced 14 vessels between 1957 and 1962. The Government prioritized shipbuilding as one of the core industries of the economy, in 1973 they established the China Shipbuilding Corporation which was merged with TSBC in 1978. In 2008 the ship- and boat-building industry had a production value of 2.09b USD with CSBC accounting for 54% of production, small and medium yards 22% and yacht builders 16%.
As of 2009 there were 116 shipyards (including 34 yacht builders) and 10 marine equipment companies in Taiwan. Major shipyards include CSBC Corporation, Taiwan, Jong Shyn Shipbuilding Company, and Lungteh Shipbuilding. Military and Coast Guard orders make up a large portion of shipbuilders books by dollar value. Between the Taiwanese Navy and the Coast Guard Administration Taiwan spends approximately a billion dollars a year on new vessel construction.
Yacht building
One third of new yachts sold in the US between 1977 and 1981 were made in Taiwan. In 1987 Taiwan exported 1,755 vessels worth US$190.8 million to the US. During this era more than 100 shipyards and boatbuilders in Taiwan built craft for the export market. Between 1986 and 1992 the New Taiwan Dollar appreciated 58% against the US Dollar which made Taiwanese built yachts significantly less competitive in the US market. By 1994 dozen yacht and boat builders had gone out of business or been acquired by competitors. Sales recovered but fell again after the 2008 Recession before strengthening again.
In 2017 Taiwan exported one hundred and sixty two yachts. In 2018 Taiwan was the fourth largest yacht building nation by feet of yacht built after Italy, The Netherlands and Turkey. Major yacht and boat builders include Horizon Yachts, Ocean Alexander, Johnson Yachts, Jade Yachts, and Ta Shing Yacht Building. Taiwan remained fourth in the world through 2021.
Maritime recreation
Regulations enacted during the martial law era meant that ownership of personal leisure craft was not permitted until 2010. While maritime recreation facilities and infrastructure remain underdeveloped the Taiwanese government has emphasized marine sports and related tourism as an economic opportunity for Taiwan's outlying islands.
The development of Taiwan's domestic yachting industry has been led by its domestic yacht manufacturers with Kha Shing and Horizon building marinas with associated repair/refit facilities.
Aquaculture
Aquaculture has a long history in Taiwan. By 2006 the production of Taiwanese coastal aquaculture was valued at NT$11,817 million. In the 21st century high technology is playing a greater part in Taiwan's aquaculture industry as the industry struggles to cope with labor shortages and fierce foreign competition. The Taiwanese government operates six fisheries and aquaculture research centers.
The Aquaculture Taiwan Expo & Forum is the primary aquaculture trade show in Taiwan, it is held concurrently with the Livestock Taiwan Expo & Forum and the Asia Agri-Tech Expo & Forum.
The Taiwanese scientist Liao I-chiu is known as the "Father of Shrimp Farming,” having pioneered many of the techniques and overcome many of the technical hurdles which allowed the creation of the modern global shrimp farming industry. The giant river prawn is widely cultivated in Taiwan. In 2012 Taiwan produced 3% of world production.
Milkfish is one of Taiwan's most commercially important fish, yearly production is 50,000 tons of milkfish valued at $4.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Consumption and ranching of milkfish in Taiwan dates back hundreds of years.
The Taiwanese ornamental fish and shrimp industry is significant with more than 250 commercial operations, ~200 of them with operations in Pingtung County. Taiwan was once known as the “cichlid kingdom” for its specialization in cichlids, a fad which culminated in the breeding of the blood parrot cichlid in 1986. The fields of biotechnology and applied ecology are playing an ever increasing role in the Taiwanese aquarium sector.
Fisheries
Taiwan is one of the largest fishing nations on earth and the associated fish processing industry is also significant. More than one third of the worlds longline tuna fishing vessels are operated by Taiwanese companies with the total strength of the distant waters fishing fleet at more than 2,000 vessels. The fishing industry is estimated to be worth approximately two billion dollars. Taiwan's ocean fisheries sector employs 350,000 people and there are 130,000 fishing households in Taiwan.
Taiwanese conglomerate FCF Co, Ltd. is the largest tuna trader in the world moving more than 500,000 tons a year, in 2019 they acquired Bumble Bee Foods for close to 1 billion dollars.
Distant-water fishing
Taiwan has the world's second largest distant-water fishing fleet with 1,100 vessels Taiwan flagged or directly owned vessels that employ 35,000 migrant sailors primarily from Indonesia and the Philippines.
Taiwan's overseas fishing fleet has been criticized for a history of abuse and a lack of protection for migrant laborers, often from Southeast Asia. Official Taiwanese sources put the number of foreign workers aboard Taiwanese vessels at 26,000 but NGOs and US government agencies put the figure around 160,000. Foreign fishermen frequently report non-payment, long work hours, and verbal and physical abuse at the hands of their captains and officers, who are often Taiwanese. In recent years Taiwan has made significant progress on the issue, but abuse remains widespread. In terms of human rights the distant waters fishing fleet lags far behind the rest of Taiwanese industry.
A 2020 Greenpeace investigation found Taiwanese vessels in the Atlantic Ocean engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. They also found significant evidence of the abuse of foreign laborers. They also documented Taiwanese fishing companies using flags of convenience to obscure vessel ownership as well as unreported at sea transfers of fish. Taiwanese fisheries conglomerate FCF was specifically singled out for criticism for links to illegal fishing and forced labor.
In October 2020 the US Department of Labor added the Taiwanese distant waters fleet's products to its list of goods produced by child or forced labor. In May 2021 the Control Yuan ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Labor, and the Fisheries Agency to address the issue and heavily criticized their lack of action.
Offshore wind power
The first offshore wind farms in Taiwan, Formosa 1 Offshore Wind Farm, started its commercial operation in April 2017 at off the coast of Miaoli County. The Formosa II wind farms will be constructed also offshore Miaoli County with a planned capacity of 300-500 MW. The Formosa III wind farm will be constructed offshore Changhua County with a planned capacity of 1,900 MW. Taiwan has one of the fastest growing offshore wind power industries in the world. As of 2020, there were 361 onshore turbines and 22 offshore turbines in operation with the total installed capacity of 845.2 MW.

Maritime education
In 2007 the Ministry of Education released the Marine Education Policy, the first education policy document with a maritime focus. As of 2014 marine and maritime education at the primary and secondary level had been greatly expanded with each of Taiwan's 22 counties, special municipalities and cities establishing a marine education center at either an elementary or high school. Within nationwide science curriculums the portion of marine centered content has been increased. Marine issues are also taught to 9th graders nationwide as part of a curriculum on oceans and climate change.

High Gun (foaled 1951 in Kentucky) was an American Champion Thoroughbred racehorse.
Background
His sire, Heliopolis, was a two-time Leading sire in North America. His dam was Rocket Gun whose damsire was Man o' War.
Trainer Max Hirsch purchased High Gun for Robert J. Kleberg's King Ranch for $10,200 at the 1952 Keeneland Yearling Sale.
Racing career
In 1954 High Gun was the best Three-Year-Old colt in the United States, winning the Peter Pan Handicap, Dwyer Stakes, the third leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, the Belmont Stakes, and then beat older horses in the Manhattan Handicap, Sysonby Mile, and Jockey Club Gold Cup. In November of that year, an injury kept High Gun out of the prestigious Washington, D.C. International Stakes won by Fisherman, a colt High Gun had beaten in June's Belmont Stakes and October's Jockey Club Gold Cup. High Gun was voted the 1954 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.
Racing at age four in 1955, High Gun continued his winning ways, capturing two of the New York Handicap Triple races, the Metropolitan and Brooklyn, and was second in the third, the Suburban. That year he followed Tom Fool as the only horses to ever win the Sysonby Mile twice, doing it by defeating the great Nashua. High Gun was voted his second Champion's title as the 1955 American Champion Older Male Horse.
Stud record
After three years of racing, High Gun was retired to stud duty but was not successful.

Kuzenbo (Japanese: 九千坊), also spelled as Kusenbo and Kyusenbo, is the king of kappa in Japanese mythology. He lives in Chikugo River.
Mythology
A legend from Tanushimaru, Fukuoka says that a local river is where all kappa originates. A clan of kappa once lived in the Yellow River in China, but migrated to Kuma River. The kappa clan had over nine-thousand members, and was called the Kuzenbo clan, which was also the name of their leader. Katō Kiyomasa recruited the help of local monkeys, which are the enemies of kappa, to defeat the king Kuzenbo and his clan.
Another legend, told through kamishibai, tells how Kuzenbo, imprisoned in a mountain, was blasted all the way to the Deccan Plateau in India after the mountain he was stuck in was struck by lightning. After the imprisonment of Kuzenbo, Sha Wujing emerged from the Yellow River in China. A great battle between the mountain kappa, lead by Kuzenbo, and the river kappa, lead by Sha Wujing, took place in the Taklamakan Desert. Sha Wujing and Kuzenbo decided to compare their strength by lifting megaliths. It was a close competition, but Sha Wujing finally surrendered when Kuzenbo lifted a megalith that weighed nine-thousand tons and threw it very far, which was a feat he could not match. With Sha Wujing having surrendered, Kuzenbo became the leader of the river and mountain kappa, making him the leader of all kappa in the world. The clan of kappa travelled along the Silk Road through China and Korea and eventually came to Japan. Kuzenbo had nine-thousand of his kappa travel all around Japan and settle in every river in the country. He was able to watch them all from atop the mountain Kuzenbuyama.
In popular culture
Kuzenbo appears as a playable character in the video game Smite.

Air Commodore (retired) Mike Tichafa Karakadzai (Name 'Karakadzai' origin from Madagascar) (7 March 1957 – 19 August 2013) was a former senior officer in the military of Zimbabwe. Europe, and more recently Australia, have frozen his assets and forbidden his travel in their territories.
Karakadzai means remember in the Ndau language of Eastern Zimbabwe.
Karakadzai qualified for a Graduate Diploma in Purchasing and Supply from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply in the United Kingdom.
He obtained an MSc in Strategic Management from the University of Derby.
He attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in the United Kingdom where he obtained an MSc in Defence Strategic Studies.
He was appointed Deputy Secretary for Policy and Procurement in the Zimbabwe Ministry of Defence in 2000.
In October 2002 the United Nations published the Final report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The report said Karakadzai had the position of Deputy Secretary of COSLEG, which the United Nations described as "a Congo-Zimbabwe joint stock company ... a key vehicle for military-backed commerce involving mostly diamonds, banking and timber in the Government-held areas". It named Karakadzai as a key player in arranging a January 2001 deal with John Bredenkamp's Tremalt whereby Tremalt obtained copper mining resources in the DRC at a nominal price in exchange for paying a share of proceeds to the governments of the DRC and Zimbabwe. Some of the payments were to be made in the form of military equipment.
Karakadzai was named in February 2004 by the European Union as being among Zimbabwe government members whose assets must be frozen by members and who would be barred from entry or transit by members of the union.
In December 2008 Australia added him to its list of targeted sanctions against those responsible for the human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.
On 1 November 2005 Karakadzai was appointed General Manager of the National Railways of Zimbabwe.
In February 2011 President Robert Mugabe said that Karakadzai would be in charge of his reelection campaign in Harare, at a date to be announced. Sources said this was likely to be a very violent campaign.
In May 2011 Karakadzai said that lack of credit from foreign lenders was preventing the National Railways of Zimbabwe from replacing aging equipment. He blamed this on illegal sanctions imposed on the country by the west. He died in a car accident on 19 August 2013 in Matebeleland after his vehicle hit a cow and overturned.

In Māori mythology Hinepiripiri occurs in some versions of the legend of Tāwhaki as Tāwhaki's wife and the mother of Wahieroa (Reed 1963:165).
Hinepiripiri nursed Tāwhaki back to health after he was attacked and left for dead by two of his brothers-in-law, jealous that their wives preferred the handsome Tāwhaki to them. Hinepiripiri helped him back to their house, and brought home a long piece of timber for the fire, to keep him warm. Shortly afterwards, a son was born to them, and named Wahieroa. The name, meaning 'long piece of firewood', was chosen to fix in their son's mind the wrong that had been done to Tāwhaki, in order that one day Wahieroa might avenge him (Reed 1963:165).

"Duck and Cover" is the eighth episode of the second season of the HBO original series The Wire. The episode was written by George Pelecanos from a story by David Simon & George Pelecanos and was directed by Dan Attias. It originally aired on July 20, 2003.
Plot
After failing to reconcile with his ex-wife, McNulty goes on a drinking binge and tries to drive home drunk. After he crashes his car and cuts his hand, McNulty eats at a diner and ends up having a one-night stand with the waitress. While drinking with Bunk, he expresses a desire to work murder cases again. Pearlman is shown how phone logs and photographic evidence link the east side warehouse to White Mike and Proposition Joe. They have identified Serge and tracked his cell phone through truck rental records. His phone records show that he calls the warehouse every day that a container goes missing. Herc and Carver have linked Nick to Frog, information which they have falsely reported as being obtained from an informant. The judge signs off on the detail's request for a wiretap, but has Herc and Carver do chores in his house in exchange.
Daniels is persuaded to appeal to Rawls to allow McNulty's transfer to the Sobotka detail, which Rawls reluctantly does. Meanwhile, in a scheme to recover the money Carver lost on the destroyed surveillance bug, Herc gets his cousin Bernard to pose for photos as their fake informant, "Fuzzy Dunlop." Carver hands the paperwork to Daniels, who balks at the name and high price but signs off anyway. Pearlman meets with Bunk and Greggs and learns that the same company owns both the warehouse and the apartments, which they speculate are being used as a cat house. They decide they need someone to go undercover to infiltrate the apartment as a john and settle on McNulty when he reports in on the Sobotka detail.
Greggs and McNulty set up surveillance of a parking garage at the apartment building. They pull over one of the johns and get him to explain how to contact the madam. Freamon, Beadie, and Prez notice a potential container theft from a ship where Horseface is working as a checker. This time the surveillance work runs in combination with the wiretaps and the detail tracks the container to the warehouse. When Frank sends out a second container as a decoy, McNulty rushes to tail it. Beadie arranges to slow down the rig with a fictitious traffic stop until McNulty can get into position.
Ziggy is egged on by the other stevedores to retaliate against Maui's taunting. His attempt ends with Ziggy stranded atop a two-story container. When Horseface reports the fight to Frank, he is too distracted by their month-end finances. Frank goes to pay his overdue cell phone bill and learns that his account is "flagged" to not be cut off—a possible clue that law enforcement is monitoring his activity. Later, Frank spots Greggs on the docks when she is posing as an engineer to watch the smuggling operation. He then learns that Beadie has been detailed to the Baltimore Police, and not transferred to Fairfield as she had claimed. He sends out the decoy container and sees it being stopped. He uses the untapped office phone to set up a meeting with The Greek; the detail sees that the call was made but cannot hear its contents.
Frank offers his brother Louis a position with the port advisory board. Louis refuses, noting the position has been offered to him because Frank made contributions and insists that everything he has comes straight. Frank is infuriated that Louis has a sense of moral superiority over his choices. Ziggy buys a duck from a neighborhood man who keeps birds. He meets with Nick, who asks about the fight with Maui and can't hide his amusement. Ziggy takes the duck to the bar, entertaining the other stevedores with the bird's propensity to drink whiskey and beer on top of the bar. Glekas and Serge unload the clean container and angrily phone Vondas at the cafe. The detail traces the call and recognizes it as the same number that Frank dialed. Vondas instructs Serge to dump the container; McNulty follows it for a time but is recalled by Daniels.
Frank and Nick meet with The Greek, who is impressed by Frank's caution and suggests they only move clean containers for a while. Nick insists that they are to be paid in full for moving the containers, and The Greek agrees to their terms. After Frank slams the table, The Greek mocks him by saying he should spend some money on things that will make him happy, such as a new coat or a new car a clear reference to Ziggy. Meanwhile, the detail dismisses the clean container as a mistake, but Freamon is pleased to have obtained Vondas' phone number. McNulty and Beadie go for a drink and discuss their past relationships. While at the bar, McNulty calls the number for the madam and sets up an appointment. McNulty has another drink at Beadie's home but leaves when he sees pictures of her children, realizing nothing good could come from sleeping with her.
Bodie, Poot, and Puddin lament that their weak product has led to a lack of trade. After noticing an independent crew dealing on their territory with more success, Bodie and Poot organize a crew to drive them from the corner. They succeed, but expect retaliation.
Production
Title reference
The title refers in part to Ziggy's pet duck. It also refers to Frank's realization that the docks are under surveillance and to the coverup measures he has to take. This could also be seen as a warning call to surrounding characters or the audience about McNulty's actions after his failed reconciliation with his ex-wife.
Epigraph
Ziggy asks why the ducks don't leave their cages when they are free to do so, the reason being that their wings are clipped. This serves as a metaphor for many of the groups in The Wire, and the individuals that find themselves in some way caged—the stevedores, the illegal immigrants, D'Angelo, the police, the corner boys.
Non-fiction elements
Ziggy references Stephen L. Miles, a Baltimore lawyer remembered by locals due to the local-run late-night commercial advertising his firm.

Felton is a small village and civil parish in the county of Herefordshire, England, and is north-east from the city and county town of Hereford. The closest town is the market town of Bromyard, to the north-east.
History
Felton is derived from the Old English 'fenn' with 'tūn' meaning a "farmstead or village in a fen or marshland", or a 'feld- tūn' meaning a "tūn in a feld". In the Domesday Book the 1086 manor is written as 'Feltone', and in 1242 as 'Feltun'.
At the time of the Norman Conquest the manor was in the Hundred of Tornelaus and county of Herefordshire. Domesday records a 1086 population of 7 households. It contained one smallholder (middle level of serf below and with less land than a villager), five slaves, and one Frenchman. Ploughland area was defined by three lord's and one men's plough teams. In 1066 the canons of St Guthlac at Hereford held the manorial lordship, who in 1086 remained lords and were also tenants-in-chief to king William I.
In 1909 the civil parish is described as half a mile south of the road from Leominster to Ledbury, and about east from Withington station on the Hereford, Ledbury and Worcester section of the Great Western Railway. It was in the Northern division of Herefordshire, the Broxash hundred, and the Union—poor relief and joint parish workhouse provision set up under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834—petty sessional division and county court district of Bromyard.
The ecclesiastical parish in 1909 served 97 people, was in the rural deanery of Weston (in 1858 the Frome deanery), and the archdeaconry of the Diocese of Hereford. The parish church of St Michael, which was rebuilt in 1854 to the design of architect Thomas Nicholson of Hereford, was described as being an "edifice of local stone with Bath stone dressings" in Decorated style. St Michael's comprised a nave, chancel, vestry, a south porch, a western embattled tower with five bells, four "newly cast" by 1858. The interior contained an organ chamber, a carved alabaster pulpit, and a reredos of Caen stone. In 1891 the church was "thoroughly" restored, costing £800, which included interior renovation and the addition of two further stained glass windows, the addition of a short spire to the tower, and much exterior masonry renewed. In 1858 a sedilia and encaustic nave and chancel floor tiles were recorded. The church in 1909 could seat 90 people, and contained a church register dating to 1637. The living was a rectory with a value of £144 a year net income, and also included of glebe—an area of land used to support a parish priest—and a residence, in the gift of Messrs. Wood, who were also lords of the manor.
John Stanhope Arkwright, great-great grandson of industrialist Sir Richard Arkwright, and MP for Hereford, was one of the two major 1909 landowners, whom at the time was living at Lyonshall. Parish soil is described as clayey, with a subsoil of clay, on which were grown wheat, beans, turnips, apples, and hops in 1858 on , and in 1909 on . Population in 1831 was 135 people in 22 houses; in 1851 was 112 people, and in 1901 was 69. Local Government Board Orders of March 1884 transferred the settlement area of Lower Hopes to Felton from Ullingswick, while part of Felton was transferred to Bodenham. The parish mail was accepted and delivered through Bromyard in 1858, and through Worcester via Pencombe in 1909. The closest money order and telegraph office was less than south-east at Burley Gate on the present A465 road. School pupils of Felton were educated at Preston Wynne in 1909. In 1858 children were educated at a school supported by private subscription, providing for the Felton, Ullingswick and Little Cowarne parishes. There was also a Sunday school at Felton. Listed commercial trades and occupations in the 1909 parish were five farmers, including one who ran a farming company which also grew hops, and another two who also grew hops. Farmers in 1851 numbered six.
Geography
Felton parish is, at its widest, about from north to south and east to west, with an area of . Adjacent parishes are Bodenham at the north, Ullingswick at the north-east, Ocle Pychard at the south-east, and Preston Wynne with a small part of Marden at the south-west.
The parish is rural, of farms, arable and pasture fields, managed woodland and coppices, water courses, isolated and dispersed businesses, residential properties, and the small nucleated settlement of Felton. The only through route, and through the centre of the parish, is the minor road which runs north-east to south-west between the A417 and A465 roads, both outside the parish. The A417 forms a small part of the boundary with Ullingswick at the extreme east. All other routes are country lanes, farm tracks, access roads and footpaths. A stream which rises towards the west of the parish, flows north-east to south-west. A further stream at the south, which forms the boundary with Ocle Pychard, joins the first stream outside the parish and becomes a tributary for the River Lugg, to the west.
Governance
Felton is represented on the lowest tier of UK governance by two members on the nine-member Ocle Pychard Group Parish Council, which also represents the parishes of Ocle Pychard and Ullingswick. As Herefordshire is today a unitary authority—no district council between parish and county councils—the parish sends one councillor, representing the Three Crosses Ward, to Herefordshire County Council. The parish is represented in the UK parliament as part of the North Herefordshire constituency, held by the Conservative Party since 2010 by Bill Wiggin.
In 1974 Felton became part of the now defunct Malvern Hills District of the county of Hereford and Worcester county, instituted under the 1972 Local Government Act. In 2002 the parish, with the parishes of Avenbury, Bromyard and Winslow, Little Cowarne, Ocle Pychard, Pencombe with Grendon Warren, Stoke Lacy and Ullingswick, was reassessed as part of Bromyard Ward which elected two councillors to Herefordshire district council. Until Brexit, on 31 January 2020, the parish was represented in the European Parliament as part of the West Midlands constituency.
Community
Felton falls under the Wye Valley NHS Trust; the closest hospital is Bromyard Community Hospital at Leominster, with the closest major hospital Hereford County Hospital at Hereford. Nearest primary education is Burley Gate C.E. Primary School, to the south-east, while the parish falls within the catchment area of Queen Elizabeth High School at Bromyard, to the north-east.
The Anglican parish church is St Michael the Archangel's, in the ecclesiastical parish of Felton and Preston Wynne, in the Deanery of Hereford and the Diocese of Hereford. The church is supported by Herefordshire Historic Churches Trust.
The parish is served by a bus stop outside the parish on the A465 road at Burley Gate on the Hereford to Bromyard sections of the Hereford to Ledbury and Hereford to Worcester bus routes. The closest rail connections are at Hereford railway station, to the south-west, on the Crewe to Newport Welsh Marches Line, the Oxford to Hereford Cotswold Line, and by West Midlands Trains to Birmingham.
Landmarks
Within Felton are four Grade II listed buildings, being St Michael's Church, two houses, and a hop kiln.
St Michael's Church dates to the 1853 to 1854 rebuilding to the designs of Hereford architect Thomas Nicholson (1823–95), one of his earliest works, with an 1891 added porch and recessed pyramid stump spire to the tower by Nicholson & Son. Constructed of "local grey sandstone" with a slate roof it comprises a nave with a stepped down and narrower chancel, a west tower, a north vestry, and a south porch. The church is of Decorated style, the tower of three stages with diagonal buttresses and a turret at the north-east. The upper bell stage has two-light louvered abat-son. Above the south entrance is a niche with a figure of St Michael. There are three windows in the chancel, the east being of three lights with geometrical tracery and stained glass imagery depicting Christ. The ceiling of the plastered-wall chancel is painted blue over the sanctuary at the east, with rafters having painted stars; at the north the vestry is entered through a "wide" arch. At the south of the chancel is a piscina and a window seat, and at the north, a "large" aumbry, with the floor laid with encaustic tiles. Fixtures and fittings included a Perpendicular font, and an 1882-dated pulpit with "symbols of the Evangelists". The stone reredos contains a statue niche and quatrefoil details.

Hamptonville is an unincorporated community located in southwestern Yadkin County, North Carolina, United States. Hamptonville is named for Henry Hampton (1750–1832), a colonel in the Revolutionary Army. Hampton set aside land for a town in 1806.
As of the United States 2000 Census, the Census-designated place (CDP) of Hamptonville (ZIP code 27020) had a population of 5,901. It is a Piedmont Triad community. The community is primarily rural and agricultural with many residences scattered across the area. Denser residential and business development is centered on Brooks Crossroads, which is generally the hub of the town as it is just north of US 421 at US 21 and Old Hwy 421 and is the primary route for commuters to work in and out of town and to the elementary school.
Demographics
Hamptonville's Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) has a population of about 5,901 as of the 2000 census. The population is 50.1% male and 49.9% female. About 94% of the population is white, .6% African-American, 0.1% American Indian, 0.2% Asian, 9.4% Hispanic, and 4.48% of another races. 0.8% of people are two or more races. There are no native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders.
The average household size is 2.6 people, and the average family has 3.0 people. There are 2,491 houses, with 90.9% of them occupied, 82.7% bought and 17.3% rented. There are 226 vacant housing units.
The median household income is $37,241 with 9.7% of the population (6.6% of families) living below the poverty line.
Transportation
Interstate 77 and U.S. Route 421 intersect in the community. The four-lane highways provide easy access to Charlotte to the south and Winston-Salem to the east. U.S. Route 21 also passes through Hamptonville.
Nearby cities/towns
Nearby towns/cities are: Yadkinville, Jonesville, Elkin, Statesville, Union Grove, Wilkesboro, Harmony and Boonville.
Business and development
While the official location of Hamptonville is along US 21, south of Highway 421 near the original village and Flat Rock Church, the center of activity for Hamptonville is at Brooks Crossroads and along the Rocky Branch Rd corridor. Hamptonville has a light business development that is primarily centered on the Rocky Branch Rd corridor and along US 21 at Brooks Crossroads. These facilities include eating and dining establishments, general retail and merchandise stores, service stations, motels, and two very popular flea markets. Sedgewick Homes is a new arrival to the town and has two show homes at its facility. They also occupy a warehouse near this location. There are also other corner stores and businesses scattered further into the more rural areas of the town including small retail shops, garages, and agricultural and farm supply stores.
Blue Rhino operates a propane tank regional distribution center in Hamptonville. Lydall Corporation (NYSE: LDL) operates an automotive thermal/acoustical plant a few miles west of Brooks Crossroads. These companies are two of the largest employers in the county.
A location at the intersection of two heavily traveled highways has lured some commercial growth to the area. Sewer, water, and natural gas have been placed at some locations on Rocky Branch Rd with hope for additional growth.
Yadkin County officials awarded contracts in 2006 to extend water and sewer service to the area. Part of the county's $5.2 million public utilities project calls for extending water lines from nearby Jonesville along U.S. 21 south and from Yadkinville west to the I-77/U.S. 421 interchange. Further, sewer service will be offered though a line along U.S. 421 extended from west of Yadkinville to the interchange. The project is expected to start in March 2007, according to The Tribune.
The agricultural and farming industry is an anchor and big business for the Hamptonville area. Multiple farms and agricultural centers cover the area. The primary crops found are corn, tobacco, soy beans, and wheat. In addition there is an abundance of poultry and other livestock holding and processing facilities. One of the most popular attractions to the area finds its roots in agriculture. Wineries are now a popular fixture in Hamptonville.

Early village
Hamptonville was first established in the late 18th century and chartered in 1818. The center of the village was Flat Rock Baptist Church, one of the oldest Baptist churches in western North Carolina. The church, which was first called Petty's Meeting House, can trace its history back to at least 1783. A historical marker was erected at the church, which is still active today.
Up the road from the church is the Hampton Family House, the oldest house in Yadkin County. It was built circa 1757 by Thomas Hampton (1728-1796) father of Henry Hampton (1750-1832). Henry Hampton served as a Colonel in the Revolutionary War and founded the town of Hamptonville. The house passed to Henry's son, Dr. John Hampton (1795-1872). Upon the death of Dr. Hampton the house passed to his son, Civil War Colonel John A. Hampton (1836-1917). The house then passed to Colonel Hampton's daughter, Nellie Hampton Bell (1875-1950), then to her daughter, Margaret Bell Gough (1908-1983). The house, which has remained in the same family for more than 250 years, is currently owned and occupied by Margaret Bell Gough's grandson Adam Charles Pardue, the 8th generation of the same family to own and occupy the house.
At one time, the town well was in the middle of the street, but it was paved over when U.S. 21 was built in the area in 1940.
The postal area of Hamptonville includes a number of historic communities, including Brooks Crossroads, Buck Shoals, Windsors Crossroads and part of Lone Hickory.
Attractions
The Windsor's Crossroads Community Building, a two-story schoolhouse constructed about 1915, is at the intersection of Buck Shoals and Windsor Roads near the Iredell County line. The building has hosted an old-time music jam on Friday nights since 1990.
The area is part of the Yadkin Valley wine region. Four vineyards located within a five-mile radius make up the Swan Creek Wine Trail in the area: Buck Shoals, Raffaldini, Windy Gap and Laurel Gray wines.
It is not unusual to spot Amish buggies in the community. A small Amish community settled in the area, beginning in the 1980s. The Shiloh General Store, 5520 St. Paul Church Road, is an Amish-run store that sells baked goods, cheeses, spices and hand-crafted children's toys and furniture.
Carolina Skydive is a skydiving facility located at Swan Creek Airport on Swan Creek Rd near Howell School Rd or near the town of Jonesville about 10 minutes from Hamptonville.
There are two very popular Flea Markets on Rocky Branch Rd that on the weekends have several vendors, stands, and shops open. Locals as well as visitors frequent these facilities and often find it challenging to find a parking spot.
Public schools
Most students in the area attend West Yadkin Elementary School, a kindergarten through sixth-grade public community school on Old U.S. Highway 421. The school opened in 1935 as a high school, but became an elementary-only school after consolidation in 1967. The school was mostly rebuilt after a 1986 countywide bond referendum.
West Yadkin is a focal point for the community and one of the largest schools in Yadkin, with about 800 students.
West Yadkin is one of three feeder schools for Starmount High School, which is located north of the Hamptonville area on Longtown Road.
A new middle school named Starmount Middle School opened in Fall 2009 for 7-8 grade students. The school is located on Longtown Rd beside Starmount High School.

The Multiplication Table is an album by the American jazz pianist Matthew Shipp, recorded in 1997 and released on the Swiss hatOLOGY label.
The album features a trio with longtime partner William Parker on bass and newcomer Susie Ibarra on drums, who at the time were the rhythm section for the David S. Ware Quartet. Shipp covers three standards, Joseph Kosma's "Autumn Leaves", Duke Ellington's "C Jam Blues" and Billy Strayhorn's "Take the 'A' Train".
Reception
In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek states: "The Multiplication Table is, along with a previous Hat release, By the Law of Music with strings, Shipp's masterpiece thus far. Mr. Shipp may be the most exciting composer/pianist since Herbie Nichols." By contrast, The Penguin Guide to Jazz wrote that the album "is sometimes as dry as its title" and notes that "the problem is with the recording, which has the piano too far back, the drums too far forward and the bass often loss."

Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal (अखिल भारतीय गान्धर्व महाविद्यालय मंडल, "All India Music University Board") is an institution for the promotion and propagation of Indian classical music and dance. The administrative offices of ABGMVM are in Miraj, while its main music school or Sangeet Vidyalaya is in Vashi, Navi Mumbai. The institution provides training and certification in vocal music; instrumental music, including melody instruments such as sitar as well as percussion instruments such as tabla; and various classical dance forms such as Odissi, Bharata Natyam, and Kathak.
ABGMVM has laid out courses of study in these performing arts for levels ranging from Prarambhik (beginner) to Sangeetacharya (literally "teacher of music"; equivalent to a doctorate). Around 1,200 affiliated institutions throughout India and elsewhere in the world follow the ABGMVM syllabi. The ABGMVM conducts examinations based on these syllabi twice a year, in April/May and November/December, at 800 centers around the world.
History
ABGMVM is built on the foundations laid by Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, who along with Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande was responsible for the democratization and spread of musical education among the Indian middle class in the early twentieth century. On 5 May 1901, Paluskar set up a music school called Gandharva Vidyalaya in Lahore. Eventually, he moved the school to Bombay, and in 1915, inaugurated a new building for the school. However, financial and operational difficulties led to the school's closure in 1924.
After Paluskar's death in 1931, his students decided to carry on his educational work. Shortly after his death, Shankarrao Vyas and N.M. Khare convened a meeting in Ahmedabad. At this meeting, a decision was made to set up a board (mandal) that would coordinate and guide these educational activities. Thus, the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal was established.
Paluskar's students set up music schools throughout India. For example, Vinay Chandra Maudgalya set up a Gandharva Mahavidyalaya in Delhi in 1939. These schools followed the syllabi prescribed by ABGMVM, and students appeared for examinations conducted by that board. Over the years, the number of affiliated schools has continued to grow. Today, about 100,000 students appear for examinations conducted by ABGMVM every year.
Examinations and Qualifications
ABGMVM offers the following examinations.
Note: An individual with a Visharad qualification is considered to have equivalent musical knowledge to someone with a bachelor's degree in music. However, the Visharad by itself is not the equivalent of a bachelor's per se, as the course of study is entirely music-based and does not include the general requirements typical of bachelor's degrees. As a result, universities such as the University of Mumbai or SNDT Women's University require that individuals with a Visharad who are seeking admission to master's of music programs also have some bachelor's degree, irrespective of field, alongside the Visharad.

Empel is a village and former municipality, which is now a quarter of 's-Hertogenbosch in the Dutch province of North Brabant.
History
Archaeological evidence shows Celtic and Roman traces in the area. The site of a Roman temple was of special interest.
In medieval times there were two Lordships (heerlijkheid) in the area. The Lordship of Empel and the Lordship of Meerwijk, but as they were always in one hand, they became known as Lordship of Empel en Meerwijk. The center was in the village now called Oud-Empel. Empel en Meerwijk Castle, the seat of the Lord of Empel en Meerwijk, was in an area called 'Het Slot', Dutch for 'The Castle'. When Empel village was moved later on, it came to lie inside the new Empel village.
During the Eighty Years' War the area suffered greatly, because it was in the frontline from 1579 till 1609, and then again from 1621-1629. Empel village was even abandoned for some decades, and the Castle was probably also ruined in these years. In 1585 the Battle of Empel was named for the village now called Oud-Empel.
In the eighteenth century the owner of the castle built a new manor Meerwijk Castle at Dieskant on the Dieze, hastening the decay of the medieval castle. During the French period the lordships were abolished, and the new municipality of Empel en Meerwijk was formed, with Empel village on the Meuse as seat of the municipal government.
In the closing phases of World War II Empel village on the Meuse dyke was heavily damaged. Its Catholic church was subsequently demolished. From about 1949 the village with church was rebuilt as an Angerdorf at the current location. This was southeast of the old village, which was then renamed Oud-Empel. A new townhouse was also built on the new location of Empel.
In 1971 the entire municipality of Empel en Meerwijk was absorbed by 's-Hertogenbosch municipality. Empel then grew to a city quarter of 6,505 inhabitants. As a city quarter Empel includes the neighbourhoods: Maasakker, De Koornwaard, Empel-Oost and Empel-Zuid. Oud-Empel became part of Maaspoort.
Points of interest
Empel was the ancient site of a temple dedicated to Hercules Magusanus. It is one of only a few religious monuments from Germania Inferior that can be interpreted with a fair degree of certainty. Hercules Magusanus was the Latin name of the supreme god of the Batavians. Many votive gifts have been found near the temple. Amongst these, the many used weapons indicate that this temple was indeed dedicated to a non-Roman god. These archaeological traces are not visible for the public.
The Castle Park is an outdoor activity park. It shows the outline of the motte, keep and outer-bailey of former Empel en Meerwijk Castle. The park has a playground for children, a basketball court, a panna cage, a skatepark and a pétanque court. The park protects the archaeological remains of the castle, as well as those of a medieval brick oven. The latter is covered by the Empel Folly.
The Saint Landelinus Church was inaugurated on 25 December 1949. It replaced the Neogothic Landelinus Church of Oud-Empel which had been destroyed in 1945. The current church is a brick Christocentric church designed by the Tilburg architect N.H. Pontzen (1913-1979). The Stations of the Cross have been painted on the concrete pillars by Egbert Deckers. A cross was made by Albert Termote. Frans van der Burgt made a sculpture of Anthony the Great. A triptych by Léon Wiegman depicts the Miracle of Empel.
The recently dug Máxima Canal (2014) is just east of Empel. It is sided by bicycle lanes that essentially go nowhere, and are therefore very popular with sport enthusiasts.
Battle of Empel
The Battle of Empel or Miracle of Empel (Milagro de Empel in Spanish) was a battle fought on December 7 and December 8, 1585, as part of the Eighty Years' War, in which a Spanish army miraculously escaped destruction after discovering a hidden Dutch Catholic image of the Immaculate Conception.
The Spanish army was in a desperate situation, under siege by the Dutch Protestant navy and surrounded by the rivers. The story says that in the night following the discovery of the image, the rivers froze and the Spanish army ran over the frozen rivers escaping from the siege, destroying or capturing all the ships in the Dutch fleet stuck in the ice, and overrunning the Dutch army camp. In Spain, the battle is still remembered as it is believed that the Spanish army was saved due to intervention of Mary of the Immaculate Conception. In memory of the battle, the Immaculate Conception is the patroness of the Spanish infantry.
Flags
Empel does not have an official flag. Although there have been previous designs made by citizens, none of them have been classed as official flags. What Empel does have is an official Coat of Arms.

Marcarius was an imperial notary sent in 340 to enforce an imperial edict against the Donatist community, in Bagai, Numidia, Roman North Africa.
Macarius' mission
His original mission had been to distribute donations from the emperor Constans, in North Africa churches in an attempt to end the split between Donatists and Catholics. The local Donatists, however, resisted the legates and aided by Circumcellion groups from the surrounding district, a revolt took place. Rumor spread he had placed imperial images on the Eucharist table and the cry of the rebels was "What has the emperor to do with the church"
Optatus records that the Donatists struck first and the retaliation by the soldiers resulted in a slaughter, of the local church groups.
A meeting with the Donatists was called, but the legates had the bishops chained and flogged, and some days latter the bishops were killed, Donatus of Bagai thrown down a well and Marculus off a cliff. There is some suggestion that this was carried out by the soldier without Macarius orders but either way, Marcarius set camp at a nearby imperial estate and suppressed the revolt over the following months. In this "Macarius did not discriminate between moderate Donatist and extreme Circumcellionist."
Following the events at Bagai the rift between Catholic and Donatist became intractable. and never forgotten. The Donatists never trusted the Catholic factions again and the dispute became ever more violent over the coming decades.
Donatus of Bagai was held by the Donatists to be a Martyr and a shrine to him and others killed at this time has been recently excavated in Bagai.
Legacy
The phrase Macarian Times became a sound bite to express the idea of Catholic-imperial persecution by Donatists preachers."Far from securing unity, the Marcarian mission had left a bitterly divided memory half a century latter.
Augustine latter accepted the Macarius had acted excessively, while Optatus chilled those who fled from the approach of Macarius.

Malawian diaspora refers to Malawian citizens and foreign nationals of Malawian descent who relocate—temporarily or permanently—to foreign countries. There are no reliable figures on how many Malawians live abroad. Populations of Malawians can be found in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia. Malawians have historically been an important supply of both skilled and unskilled labor to other countries. Malawians were a source of labor to the diamond and gold mines in Southern Africa, particularly South Africa. Many Malawian health professionals have migrated to the Global North (developed nations) in search of employment. The migration of skilled labor has contributed to the brain drain that is affecting many African nations.
Malawians in Africa
Malawians are the most dispersed group in Southern Africa. Large population of Malawians live in southern African countries, such as Namibia, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Malawians were a source of labor to South Africa, and this supply of labor played a crucial role in Malawi-South Africa relations. This resulted in power and clout over southern African foreign affairs and diplomacy.
In Zambia, Presidents Kenneth Kaunda and Rupiah Banda were both thought to be of Malawian descent, and that this may have influenced their leadership.
Malawians in the Americas
In the United States there is a significant number of Malawians, and various cultural organizations and start-up stores have opened in the U.S. that cater to Malawians living there, and promote Malawian culture. The oldest of these being the Malawi Washington Association. African immigrants in the United States are part of the most educated group in the United States. Out of this group, Malawians rank amongst the top five countries from Africa reporting a high school diploma or more. This means that Malawians are contributing towards development through skilled labor in the United States and Canada.
Malawians in Europe
Malawians in Europe largely reside in the United Kingdom since Malawi was a former colony of Britain. Many of the Malawians in the UK are health workers, particularly doctors. There are currently more than 250 Malawian doctors in Manchester. Malawians in the UK have managed to take interest in the politics and policies of Malawi and exert their influence in their host country. As an example, they successfully campaigned against the U.S.-based Hunger Project's awarding of a Food Prize to President Bingu wa Mutharika. Their involvement has led to reaction from Mutharika, who accused the diaspora at large of tarnishing the image of his government and the country to multinational organizations.
Malawians in Scotland have been finding methods to help promote development in their home country by forming an organization to create a skills exchange in Malawi called MIND.

RiverCities Transit is a public transit system serving the cities of Longview and Kelso in Cowlitz County, Washington.
History
Public transportation service in Cowlitz County began in 1975, with the purchase of a private bus company by the cities of Longview and Kelso. The two cities partnered with the Cowlitz County government to organize a public transportation benefit area in 1987, and a 0.1 percent sales tax to fund the bus system was approved by 77.3 percent of voters on September 16, 1987. The existing service, then named the "Community Urban Bus Service" (CUBS), was transferred to the Cowlitz Transit Authority on January 1, 1988.
In 2008, CUBS put a 0.2 percent sales tax increase up for public vote, seeking $2 million in additional annual revenue to continue running service and expanding frequency and hours of operation. The increase was approved by voters, bringing the total sales tax to 0.3 percent.
The Cowlitz Transit Authority adopted a 10-year "Transit Enhancement Plan" in 2010, proposing a re-branded system with more frequent service and newer buses. In 2011, CUBS began exploring a re-brand, complete with a new name, using an online poll. "RiverCities Transit" was announced as the winner later that month, and a new blue-and-gray color scheme was adopted for the system's bus fleet the following year. A new route system, focusing on corridors where buses run every 30 to 60 minutes, debuted in August 2013; an express route between Longview and Kelso debuted earlier that year in April, reducing travel times.

USA-35, also known as Navstar 2-01, GPS II-1 and GPS SVN-14, was an American navigation satellite which formed part of the Global Positioning System. It was the first of nine Block II GPS satellites to be launched, which were the first operational GPS satellites to be launched.
Background
It was one of the 21-satellite Global Positioning System (GPS) Block II series. When complete, the constellation will provide precise position data (accurate to within 16 m) to military and civilian users worldwide. Navstar signals can be received on devices as small as a telephone. The new generation Delta is 4.2 m taller and 13% more powerful than its predecessor. It can boost 3,982 kg into low Earth orbit, 1,447 kg into geotransfer orbit. The GPS II satellites, built by Rockwell International for Air Force Space Systems Division, each have a 7.5-year design life. The Air Force intends to launch a GPS II every 2 to 3 months until the constellation of 21 operational satellites and 3 spares is aloft.
Launch
USA-35 was launched at 18:30 UTC on 14 February 1989, atop a Delta II launch vehicle, flight number D184, flying in the 6925-9.5 configuration. This was the maiden flight of the Delta II. The launch took place from Launch Complex 17A (LC-17A) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and placed USA-35 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor.
Mission
On 16 March 1989, USA-35 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 713.2 minutes, and 55.1° of inclination to the equator. The satellite had a mass of , and generated 710 watts of power. It had a design life of 7.5 years; however, it operated until 26 March 2000, when its reaction wheels failed. It was decommissioned on 14 April 2000, having been replaced by USA-150.

Non-LDP and non-JCP Coalition (非自民・非共産連立政権) are terms used in Japanese politics and mean building an alliance between moderate parties excluding right-wing conservative-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party and left-wing communist Japanese Communist Party. It is mainly used only when major political parties in Japan, except for LDP and JCP, form big tent coalition. Hosokawa Cabinet and Hata Cabinet belong to the representative "Non-LDP and non-JCP Coalition".
In general, JCP forms some power in the region, but there is no experience in power in the central politics itself. Therefore, the term "non-LDP and non-JCP Coalition" in Japan's central politics is close to meaning that it will exclude JCP from the liberal alliance to oppose the LDP's nationalist project, but will not compromise with the large conservative party, LDP. In fact, the LDP is considered the most conservative and the JCP is considered the most progressive in the Japanese political spectrum.

Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL) is one of India's manufacturers of ammunitions and missile systems. It was founded in 1970 in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. BDL was established to be a manufacturing base for guided weapon systems and begun with a pool of engineers drawn from Indian Ordnance Factories, DRDO and aerospace industries, It began by producing a first generation anti-tank guided missile - the French SS11B1. This product was a culmination of a licence agreement the Government of India entered into with Aerospatiale. BDL has three manufacturing units, located at Kanchanbagh, Hyderabad, Telangana; Bhanur, Medak district, Telangana and Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
Two new units are planned at Ibrahimpatnam, Ranga Reddy district, Telangana and Amravati, Maharashtra.
History
India began to develop indigenous missiles through the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP), which gave BDL an opportunity to be closely involved with the programme wherein it was identified as the Prime Production Agency. This opened up a plethora of opportunities to assimilate advanced manufacturing and programme management technologies and skills. Responding to the Concurrent Engineering Approaches adopted by DRDO in IGMDP, BDL was seen as a reliable and trustworthy ally, and resulted in the induction of India's first state-of- the-art Surface-to-Surface Missile Prithvi. BDL has delivered Prithvi to the three services as per requirements. BDL has forayed into the field of underwater weapon systems and air-to-air missiles and associated equipment with technology support from the DRDO and other players in this domain.
Operations
BDL has been consistently incurring profits and has been nominated as a Mini Ratna – Category-I Company by the Government of India.

Thomas B. Craighead (1798–1862) was an American politician and lawyer from the state of Arkansas. He served in the Arkansas State Senate representing Crittenden and Mississippi Counties.
Early life
Craighead was born 1798 to the Reverend Thomas Craighead and his wife Elizabeth.
Craighead County
In 1859, Senator William A. Jones, who represented St. Francis and Poinsett Counties, introduced a bill to create a new county. This county would be created from portions of Poinsett, Greene, and Mississippi Counties. Craighead opposed the bill because it would remove a large section of fertile farmland from Mississippi County, and the tax revenue derive from it. Jones waited until Craighead was absent from the chamber to push for final passage of his bill. Unknown to Craighead, Jones amended the bill to name the new county Craighead County, possibly as a gesture of goodwill. In return, the new county seat was named Jonesboro.

Somalis in Finland are residents and citizens of Finland of Somali ancestry.
Overview
The first Somali immigrants came to Finland in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, 44 Somali students studying in the Soviet Union immigrated to Finland. Between 1990 and 1995, the number of Somalia citizens in Finland increased from 44 to 4,044. The first arrivals were university students from Soviet universities in the former Soviet Union (see Zahra Abdulla). Later, more asylum seekers arrived directly from Somalia, many through a program of family unification.
In 2010, it was estimated by the Finnish immigration service (Migri) that a majority of all Somali refugees arriving in Finland were illiterate due to the Somali Civil War having destroyed the opportunities for those born after the 70s to attend the school system.
A 2012 Terveyden ja hyvinvoinnin laitos (THL) survey of Somalia-born immigrants in Finland found that, prior to their arrival, around 50% of males and 50% of females had attended primary school (Peruskoulu), 39% of males and 17% of females had attended high school (Lukio), and 11% of males and 33% of females had not attended school (Ei lainkaan). According to Statistics Finland, in 2012, 77.9% of Somalia-born immigrants in Finland had attained a lower secondary or unknown education level, 17.9% had attained an upper secondary education level, and 4.2% had attained a tertiary education level.
Like other immigrant groups in Finland, particularly Muslims, Somalis have been targets of hate crimes. According to a 2009 report by the Police College of Finland, 8% of total victims were Somali-born, while representing only 4% of suspected offenders. Most suspected perpetrators are young Finnish men, with similarly-aged Somali, Iraqi and Turkish immigrants mainly targeted. According to social workers, the pressure of living between two disparate cultures has also resulted in instances of petty crime amongst disaffected 17- to 20-year-olds in the Somali community. The situation is compounded by the unfamiliarity of Somali parents with the various social services that are available to address similar circumstances. To tackle the issue, Somali community organizations have teamed up with Finnish police and social services officials, with the municipal authorities in Helsinki endeavouring to recruit more Somali social workers.
In 2015, five young Somalis were suspects in a case of gang rape in Tapanila near Helsinki. The incident hardened the attitudes towards Somalis in Finland. Of the five accused, three were sentenced and two were acquitted. Four of the accused were minors and two of those therefore received shorter sentences.
As with many other immigrant groups in Finland, Somalis have also faced some barriers to employment, due in part to the local economic recession. However, the situation has steadily improved over the years, as more Somali immigrants have found employment in their own community, although much of this work is unmeasured. While some Somalis with language training have found jobs in their own field, others, like immigrants in general, have obtained short-term work positions.
Demographics
Somalis are one of the largest ethnic minorities in Finland, and the largest group of people of non-European origin. They are the fifth-largest minority in the country, after Finland-Swedes, Russians, Iraqis and Estonians. In 2018, there were 6,448 Somali citizens, but an equal number may have received Finnish citizenship. According to the Finnish National newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, the number of Somali-speaking people in Finland in 2010 rose by nearly 10% in a year. In 2021, there were 23,656 Somali speakers in Finland. 12,712 were born in Somalia.
78% of Somalis live in Uusimaa, 8% in Southwest Finland, 3% in Pirkanmaa and 11% in rest of Finland. 35% of Somalis are under-aged.
The total fertility rate of Somali women in Finland was 3.7 between 2017 and 2020, compared to 1.4 of Finnish women.
Culture
Religion is more important to Somali families than it is to Finnish families. Even though nearly all Somalis are Muslim, there are differences between families and individuals on how norms are perceived and obeyed. The clothing of Somali women in Finland varies from big hijabs and face covers to skinny jeans and crop tops. There are a few Christian converts and Somali atheists in Finland.
Somalis watch at least nine different Somali channels in Finland. Popular celebrations among Somalis include Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.

The second USS Mist (SP-567) was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919.
Mist was built as a private steam launch of the same name by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company at Bristol, Rhode Island, in 1904. In April 1917, the U.S. Navy informally acquired her from her owner, Edward Morell, for use as a section patrol vessel during World War I. She was commissioned as USS Mist (SP-567) on 28 April 1917. Formal acquisition of Mist from Morrell followed on 12 May 1917.
Assigned to the 1st Naval District in northern New England, Mist served for the rest of World War I as a dispatch boat and guard boat in the vicinity of Boston, Massachusetts. She also supported the minesweeping training activities of the Mine Sweeping Division, which operated along the coast of Massachusetts from its base at Boston Harbor.
Mist was returned to Morrell on 3 February 1919.

Matthew Edwin Moldover (born April 24, 1980), known as Moldover, is a musician and instrument designer based in San Francisco, CA. The MIDI Manufacturers Association has referred to him as the "Godfather of Controllerism". He is known for his musical instruments, including the Mojo, Robocaster, Octamasher and Guitar Wing.
Early life
Moldover is originally from the Washington, D.C. area and began playing guitar at the age of 13 in Rockville, MD. He discovered Berklee College Of Music on the internet and moved to Boston to attend in 1998.
He earned a degree in electronic music composition in 2002, and then moved to New York City to play in a variety of bands. He soon transitioned to a focus on solo performance; a 2003 visit to Burning Man Festival in Nevada led to him moving to San Francisco in 2008.
Career
Moldover has released a significant amount of media content in different arenas including 4 studio albums of music, many live videos of his performance known as "Live Remashing" and also instructional videos for Ask Video and others.
Before releasing an official Studio album, Moldover released a series of live recordings called Live Remashing. These were his preliminary journeys into Controllerism before he had come up with the term. In 2006, Marc Urselli of Chain D.L.K. described Live Remashing as "an encyclopedia of modern pop culture in sound format" and "the best example of how to use modern technologies to enhance and extend musicianship and artistic vision", and "the new form of DJing."
In 2009, Moldover released his debut album Moldover. Of the variety of price tiers for the release of the album, the steepest version included a fully playable circuit board, thus highlighting what is termed playable packaging. The track listings themselves were created using circuitry. Inside the package is a small playable light-theremin.
In 2016, Moldover released the studio album 4 Track which included the playable packaging Voice Crusher.
Controllerism
Moldover suggests that the Controller is "the instrument of the next generation." In 2005, he coined the term Controllerism with the encouragement of his manager of the time, DJ Shakey. On the development of Controllerism he said that "the basic styles of DJing weren't satisfying to me, I was used to a more visceral way of performing; playing guitar, singing, and producing sound with my body in real time. For me, controllerism is more along those lines than DJing."
In a 2007 article in Remix, Moldover stated that "Controllerism borrows its name from turntablism. These terms are essentially the same idea, but they revolve around different instruments."
Instrument Design
Frankentroller
The Frankentroller started as a Novation Remote 25 SL Keyboard; Moldover adapted its hardware to make it a new instrument by adding a Kurzweil keyboard touchstrip, a Korg Kaoss Pad, as well as refashioning some of the keyboards black keys to be used as crossfaders. Ean Golden of Remix subsequently stated that the Frankentroller had earned Moldover wins his personal award for "most creative mod."
Mojo
In 2010, Moldover released the MOJO, "Limited-Edition Performance MIDI Controller". This is his first "made from scratch" midi controller. It figures prominently in his live performances. In 2012, Moldover made the design for the Mojo open source. Artist Ill Gates called the Mojo, "the single greatest controller in the history of MIDI."
Robocaster
The Robocaster is a custom-made signature guitar produced by Visionary Instruments: a "hybrid instrument", it incorporates several MIDI controller options, including "gaming buttons, touch-strips, knobs, faders, switches, motion sensors, a pressure pad and a joystick."
Moldover said that he wanted to create the Robocaster as a more tactile and less sample-based instrument that allows for more traditional musicianship combined with advanced FX tweaking and midi integration.
Guitar Wing
Directly inspired by the Robocaster, the Guitar Wing adds an ergonomic, wireless MIDI controller to any electric guitar or bass. The Guitar Wing was created in collaboration with Livid Instruments. Popular Science noted that it allows "near effortless control over effects, software, digital audio workstations and even stage lights between strums."
Octamasher Jambox
Originally designed as a gift for Burning Man participants, the Octamasher is "a multi-input combination of 8 modified keyboards that link to a single brain (computer), the output of which is coordinated and controlled to allow for multiple users combining together to perform new music."

Elizabeth Kerr Warrington FRS (born 1931) is a British neuropsychologist specialised in the study of dementia. She holds a PhD in Psychology visual processing and is now an emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University College London. She formerly worked as the Head of the Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery where she is also a member of the Dementia Research Centre. She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1986.
Biography
Warrington received her PhD in psychology (visual processing) from the University College London in the 1950s. She worked as the Head of Department of Neuropsychology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, England. As of June 2015, she is an emeritus professor of clinical neuropsychology for the University College London, specifically in the UCL Institute of Neurology. She is a member of the Dementia Research Centre associated with University College London.
Warrington played a key role in the British development of Cognitive Neuropsychology a research approach that has had implications beyond the clinical sphere, providing important insights into the way that the normal human brain perceives, remembers, and talk about words, objects and events. Warrington's work has established a number of important differences (dissociations) between superficially similar cognitive abilities, for example in defining the differences between episodic memory and semantic memory and in establishing the evidence for category specific disorders of semantic knowledge; her work also defined a pattern of clinical impairment that became recognised as defining a form of dementia semantic dementia. Her work is a foundation for understanding normal function as well as for innovating clinical methods in the development of numerous tests that can be used in the diagnosis of brain injuries and diseases including dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and brain injuries resulting from a stroke and tumours. Her tests may also be used to track recovery and to plan rehabilitation
Research
Elizabeth Warrington's research work focused on cognitive abilities and deficits. She conducted extensive research in the areas of visual object recognition, memory, and dementia. Her research has played an important role in the discovery and characterisation of semantic dementia. Warrington has also contributed to the development of more accurate tests used to diagnose degenerative brain conditions.
In one of Warrington's earliest studies, she investigated eighty right-handed patients who showed signs of a unilateral cerebral lesion resulting from problems such as a stroke or tumor. Subjects with lesions affecting the right side of their brain performed worse than subjects with lesions on the left and control subjects when attempting both the Incomplete Letters Task and the Gollin Incomplete Figures Task. She went on to demonstrate that people with right hemisphere lesions had great difficulty in recognising objects photographed from unusual angles or with unusual lighting. The results of these studies provided evidence of hemispheric lateralisation of function and also had a major impact on's theory of object recognition.
Entirely by accident, Warrington working together with Lawrence Weiskrantz discovered a task in which patients with severe amnesia displayed signs of memory. She accomplished this using the Gollin incomplete figures task. When presenting patients with the second viewing of the figures, patients showed good retention of the initially unrecognisable images. These patients were classified as displaying signs of "normal" memory.
To further validate the discovery of "normal" memory in severe amnesics, Warrington used methods involving stem completion. The stem completion tasks involved patients learning a battery of words, and later identifying the learned words. Patients were able to identify a previously learned word when presented with the first three letters, but were unable to identify a previously learned word when given the choice between a learned word and unknown word. These tests provided further evidence of different types of memory, now known as implicit memory and explicit memory.
In a test administered by Warrington and Tim Shallice from University College London, the short-term memory of a patient who had head trauma following a motorcycle accident was tested. Although the patient displayed a digit span of one (as opposed to the average person's digit span of five to nine), he was able to form certain types of long-term memory. The collected data suggested that short-term memory was not necessarily required for the formation of long-term memories.
Cognitive Functioning Tests
Throughout her career, Warrington conducted many groundbreaking experiments and developed many cognitive functioning tests to measure a patient's cognitive abilities. Warrington's work is often credited with helping shape the basis of modern-day cognitive psychology. Many of Warrington's tests are still used today.
One of her most influential collection of tests is the Visual Object and Space Perception Battery, or the VOSP, published by Warrington and Merle James in 1991. This collection of tests was based on over twenty years' research into object and spatial perception in people with damage confined to one side of the brain. Although the tests were originally devised to investigate theoretical issues, they have excellent selectivity and sensitivity in a clinical context leading to their wide adoption. The VOSP tests were designed to place limited demands on other cognitive abilities and are generally easy for people without brain disorders. Some VOSP tests have been incorporated into other test batteries (e.g., The Rookwood Driving Battery) and they have also influenced other screening measures (e.g., The ACE-R). There are eight untimed tests in the VOSP that can be given either separately or as a whole. The scores obtained in a testing session can be compared with those obtained by people with brain injuries and with controls. The VOSP is widely used by clinical and research psychologists and has featured in over 250 research publications. The VOSP can be purchased from Pearson for around the price of US$230.00.
Another test that is still in use is the Verbal and Spatial Reasoning Test also known as VESPAR. VESPAR is a test that was designed by Warrington and Dawn W. Langdon in 1996. VESPAR is a reasoning test that presents a fairly new approach in how reasoning tests are performed. This test is designed to measure the fluid intelligence in neurological patients. This test is unique in that it offers more accuracy than any other test available for this type of measurement. VESPAR is divided into six sections. There are three matched sets of verbal and spatial reasoning problems, where each is dedicated to one of three forms of inductive reasoning. This includes odd one out, by analogy, and series completion. VESPAR is able to overcome many restraints that arise when performing more conventional reasoning tests by using stimuli that is more readily accessed by patients with physical or cognitive impairments due to neurological illness. VESPAR does not use timing to help evaluate performance, instead it uses high frequency stimulus words or visually distinct spatial stimuli to help determine its results. VESPAR has a multiple choice format. This format has been adopted to reduce both short-term memory load and output demands on the patient. The assessment of patients for neurodiagnostic and neurorehabilitation needs will be facilitated. VESPAR only requires the patient to do simple pointing gestures. The spatial section of the test measures the fluid intelligence of patients with aphasia. The verbal section does the same for patients with visual and spatial problems. VESPAR focuses more the instinctive ability of a patient, rather than educational experience. Thus, although originally developed for adult neurological populations, the test is suitable for a wide range of clinical, educational, occupational, and research applications. This test is also available for purchase at most online bookstores.

Ernst August, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick, Prince of Hanover (; 18 March 1914 – 9 December 1987) was head of the House of Hanover from 1953 until his death in 1987. From his birth until the German Revolution of 1918–1919 he was the heir apparent to the Duchy of Brunswick, a state of the German Empire.
He was born at Braunschweig, Germany, the eldest son of Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick and Princess Viktoria Luise of Prussia, the only daughter of Emperor Wilhelm II, Ernest Augustus's third cousin in descent from George III of the United Kingdom. Ernst August's parents were, therefore, third cousins, once removed. From his birth, he was the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick. He was also, shortly after birth in 1914, made a British prince by King George V of the United Kingdom, and was heir to the titles Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale and Earl of Armagh which were suspended under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.
Life
The christening of Ernst August in the summer of 1914 was the last great gathering of European monarchs before the start of World War I. He had an illustrious list of godparents: George V of the United Kingdom, Franz Joseph I of Austria, Nicholas II of Russia, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Frederick Francis IV, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Prince Adalbert of Prussia, Prince Oskar of Prussia, Prince Maximilian of Baden, the 1st Royal Bavarian Heavy Cavalry Regiment, and all four of his grandparents: the German Emperor and Empress and the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland.
He ceased being heir to the duchy of Brunswick at the age of four, when his father abdicated in 1918. After his father's death in 1953, he became head of the House of Hanover.
During World War II, he fought at the Russian Front as Oberleutnant in the staff of Generaloberst Erich Hoepner. He was seriously injured near Charkov in spring 1943. After the 20 July plot in 1944, he was imprisoned for a few weeks by the Gestapo in Berlin.
He had joined the SS in 1933 and remained a member for one year. His official "denazification" certificate from 1949 vetting his Third Reich associations classified him as "a nominal Nazi supporter", without being a Nazi party member, and according to a Foreign Office record.
In 1938 his sister, Princess Frederica had married the later King Paul I of the Hellenes and in 1946 his younger brother Prince George William married Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark, thus becoming the brother-in-law of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.
Ernest Augustus was himself an heir to the British titles of Prince of Great Britain and Ireland, recognised ad personam for Ernst August's father as well as for him and his siblings by King George V of the United Kingdom on 17 June 1914, Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, Earl of Armagh, which however were all suspended under the Titles Deprivation Act 1917. In addition to being a German, he also held British nationality, after successfully claiming it under the Sophia Naturalization Act 1705 in the case of Attorney-General v. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover. Nonetheless, a problem arose as foreign royal titles can't be entered into a British passport. Therefore, the titles Prince of Hanover, Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg could not be mentioned there, nor could the British titles due to the Titles Deprivation Act of 1917. The name which was finally entered into his British documents, was thus Ernest Augustus Guelph, with the addition of His Royal Highness. Guelph is thus also the British last name of his siblings and children, all styled Royal Highnesses in the United Kingdom.
In 1961 he sold his remaining properties at Herrenhausen Gardens, including the site of Herrenhausen Palace which had been destroyed by a British bombing raid in 1943. He kept however the Princely House, a small palace built in 1720 by George I of Great Britain for his daughter Anna Louise. Ernest Augustus converted Marienburg Castle into a museum in 1954, after having moved to nearby Calenberg Demesne, which caused a row with his mother, who was forced to move out. He also sold the family's exile seat, Cumberland Castle at Gmunden, Austria, to the state of Upper Austria in 1979, but his family foundation based in Liechtenstein kept vast forests, a game park, a hunting lodge, The Queen's Villa and other property at Gmunden. The family property is now managed by his grandson Ernst August.
Marriage and children
During the Second World War, specifically in 1941, his cousin Prince Hubertus of Prussia married the noted society beauty and aristocrat Baroness Maria Anna von Humboldt-Dachroeden (1916–2003). The couple, however, divorced in 1943, after her affair with her husband's cousin, Prince Ernst August of Hanover, resulted in the birth of a son, whose biological father was Prince Ernst August. Ernest Augustus however did not marry Maria Anna because his parents would not have approved, since she was considered of inadequate birth and was also a divorcée, and the marriage would have made his younger brother Prince George William heir to the headship of the House of Hanover. Thus the child, christened Christian Ernst August Hubertus, Freiherr von Humboldt-Dachroeden, was born in 1943 and currently is a bank consultant.
On 5 September 1951, Ernest Augustus married Princess Ortrud of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1925–1980). The wedding was attended by many important royal figures, including his sister Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece, and the heads of the houses of Saxony, Hesse, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, and Baden. The wedding was followed with a reception in the Gallery Building at Herrenhausen Gardens, the only part of the House of Hanover's former summer palace still intact, as the palace itself had been burned down during World War II.
His children by his first wife are:
Princess Marie of Hanover (born 1952), married Count Michael von Hochberg and had issue.
Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954), married firstly Chantal Hochuli and had issue, married secondly Princess Caroline of Monaco and had issue.
Prince Ludwig Rudolph of Hanover (1955–1988), married Countess Isabelle von Thurn und Valsassina-Como-Vercelli (1962–1988), with whom he had one son. Ludwig committed suicide shortly after discovering the body of his wife, who had died of a drug overdose.
Princess Olga Sophie Charlotte Anna of Hanover (born 1958)
Princess Alexandra of Hanover (born 1959), married Andreas, 8th Prince of Leiningen and had issue.
Prince Heinrich of Hanover (born 1961), married Thyra von Westernhagen and had issue (including a son, Albert).
Princess Ortrud died in 1980.
Ernest Augustus married again in 1981, Countess Monika zu Solms-Laubach (1929–2015), daughter of Georg, 9th Count of Solms-Laubach, and Johanna, Princess of Solms-Hohensolms-Lich.
He died at Schulenburg, Pattensen, Lower Saxony, Germany, aged 73, and was buried next to his first wife on a round bastion of Marienburg Castle (Hanover).
In popular culture
He was portrayed by Daniel Betts in the first season of the Netflix series The Crown.
Ancestry
Patrilineal descent, descent from father to son, is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations – which means that the historically accurate royal house of monarchs of the House of Hanover was the House of Lucca (or Este, or Welf).
This is the descent of the primary male heir. For the complete expanded family tree, see List of members of the House of Hanover.

Carlos Obregón Santacilia (1896–1961) was a Mexican art déco architect. He trained at the Academy of San Carlos during the Mexican Revolution. He claimed a distinguished Mexican heritage, as great grandson of Benito Juárez and grand nephew of Alvaro Obregón.
Obregón saw the new architecture following the violent and destructive Mexican Revolution as the government's impulse to be constructive. Among other works, Obregón Santacilia redesigned the building housing the Secretariat of Foreign Relations, at the request of Alberto J. Pani. The building went from a Louis XIV style structure to a neo-Colonial work, opened in 1924. Minister of Public Education in the Obregón government, José Vasconcelos asked Obregón Santacilia to design a large primary school in Mexico City, to be built in "new nationalist perspective." He also designed the new building for the Secretariat of Health and Welfare (1926), later decorated with murals by Diego Rivera. He reworked the abandoned legislative palace of the Díaz era and transformed it to the Monumento a la Revolución, located in Mexico City.

The Truganina Explosives Reserve was a secure storage facility near Altona in the Australian state of Victoria. It was in operation from 1901 to 1962 to store mainly civilian explosives for mining and construction. The camp included several storage sheds and a jetty, which were connected by a narrow-gauge horse-drawn tramway. Like the Dry Creek explosives depot at Port Adelaide, the site is a testimony to history and transportation in Australia.
Location
Altona's Truganina Explosives Reserve is located approximately south-west of Melbourne, and west of Williamstown on the shores of Port Phillip Bay.
History
The Nobel explosives factory (later ICI, then Orica) in Deer Park was set-up in 1873 to produce explosives, especially gelignite and dynamite, for quarries, mines, as well as for road, rail, dam and tunnel construction with the intention to become independent of imports from Britain and South Africa. These explosives were initially stored in specially designed magazines (Jack's Magazine) on the banks of the Maribyrnong River, upstream of Footscray, before being shipped to other parts of Australia or to New Zealand, New Guinea and the Pacific. As the population of Footscray increased, a more remote location for explosives storage was sought. In 1900, Altona had less than fifty inhabitants. The Truganina Explosives Reserve, located less than from Laverton railway station, was finally selected as a convenient location for a new explosives storage site due to its secluded coastal location.
Most of the land had been owned by George Thomas Chirnside, before he agreed in 1896 to swap of his land against of poor quality land of the government of Victoria. The Victorian Government's Victorian Act 1456 is known as the Powder Magazines Act of 1896. A Victorian Act authorized the governor to exchange this land to set-up an explosives reserve and to build and operate a narrow gauge railway line.
Narrow-gauge tramway
The 610 mm (2 ft) narrow-gauge tramway line began at Laverton railway station and ran along what are now Merton Street and Queen Street through the Truganina Explosives Reserve and then to a jetty at Laverton Creek on Altona Bay. It had eight passing loops parallel to the mainline at the storage facility, as well as sheds and dead-end sidings at Laverton station.
Explosives were delivered by the Victorian Railways from the factory in Deer Park to Laverton railway station. There, the explosives were reloaded by human chain from the railway wagons into the horse-drawn narrow-gauge wagons. The narrow-gauge railway wagons were then hauled by Clydesdale draft horses at a speed of about to the explosives reserve. The narrow-gauge railway line was 2.7 km (133 chains) long. It was in operation until 1936, when rail transport was replaced by road transport. Upon arriving at the reserve, the explosives were stored in the magazines, until they were taken to be loaded onto ships for onward transport. Nine explosives transports were carried out each day with 200 explosives boxes of 50 pounds (22.7 kg) each. Nine horses and 43 wagons were used.
When the explosives had to be shipped to other ports, the explosive boxes were taken by narrow-gauge railway to small boats (lighters) moored at the pier. The specially designed motor-less sailing ships were towed by tugs from the jetty to their moorings at Williamstown. From there lighters took their cargo to larger ships anchored at special explosives buoys in Port Philip Bay.
Magazines
Each magazine had a size of about and could store 20 tons of explosives. The magazines were made of brick, with tile roofs. The roofs were not attached to the walls - they stayed there under their own weight. This was so that, in the event of an explosion, the roof would lift off, minimising damage to the building. The explosives were stacked on air-permeable shelves, so that air could circulate around the boxes at any time. The wooden boxes for explosives were made with brass nails or with only dovetail joints to minimize the possibility of sparking. Each magazine was surrounded on three sides by a large earth wall, with an open side facing away from human activity. These earthworks were designed to protect the workers and their families from explosions. If such an explosion had taken place, the mounds were designed to direct the explosion upwards and outwards and contain the damage. The magazines were built as light as possible to minimize damage caused by flying splinters, with the same design as used in Yatala and Port Adelaide.
Operation
The operation of the explosives reserve and the narrow gauge railway was managed by the Trade and Customs Commissioner. The site was officially opened on 1 May 1901, and was enclosed by a high, long galvanized corrugated iron fence. Careful handling, transportation and storage of the explosive was of paramount importance to ensure safety for employees and residents. Employees who handled the explosives were instructed to wear leather aprons to protect their clothes and to wear canvas overshoes to prevent sparks. Boots with nailed leather soles were considered too dangerous, because of the possibility of the nails causing sparks, which could have resulted in an explosion.
By 1950, the explosives storage in Altona had reached its peak. Sixty-one magazines were in operation. Of these, 52 were used by Nobel Industries, which became later Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ), and nine by the state government. A total of 36 employees were employed in the explosives reserve. During this time, the population of Altona grew to 4,000. Therefore, the risk of explosives storage in Altona was re-assessed and alternative locations were evaluated. On 11 May 1962, the auxiliary sailing ship Failie became the last vessel to be loaded at the Truganina explosives reserve; all remaining explosives were transported to a newly built explosives warehouse at Point Wilson. The first delivery from Point Wilson took place on 25 May 1962.
After the closure of the Truganina Explosives Reserve in 1962, the Victorian Government sold most of the land, but retained for the State Labour Inspectorate for Destruction of Dangerous Goods. Until closed in 1994, unwanted explosives from throughout Victoria were brought to this site for safe destruction in a specially constructed bunker. In 1976, of the 16 hectares were transferred to the State Environmental Protection Agency for use as a vehicle test station, which was closed in June 1999. In June 2000, the Government of Victoria commissioned the Hobsons Bay City Council to administer the former Truganina Explosives Reserve on their behalf as a recreational park.
Accidents and incidents
There were no significant accidents during operation. The stables in Truganina's explosives reserve were burnt down in 1904, presumably by a swagman, however the suspect was not arrested for lack of evidence.
On 9 April 1946 an ammunition lighter had grounded in a storm and was feared to be in danger of blowing up. It was loaded with 300 tons of ammunition, mainly shells. The ammunition could not be unloaded at low tide onto trucks, because of seaweed and the softness of the sand. Thus it was tried to pull the lighter back into the sea by tugs during high tide.
Conservation and protection of landscape, culture and monuments
Plants and animals
The salt marshes and ancient sand dunes have a high conservation value and are the location of rare animal and plant species. Areas of indigenous, exotic and saline vegetation and the hills of the dune system form landscapes with different characteristics that seem timeless. The high corrugated sheet metal fence has protected the site from human entry, leaving it largely undisturbed for more than 100 years, creating a natural, native ecosystem. The reserve is home to three species of birds of local importance, the white-bellied sea eagle, Nankeen night heron and the brown quail. It also houses four bat species including chocolate wattled bat, white-striped free-tailed bat, south-eastern slider, eight other species of mammals and two species of reptiles. The Altona skipper butterfly is a rare and threatened species of butterfly, which has its main habitat at only at two other local sites, where it can find chaffey saw sedge (Ghania filum) to feed from.
Cultural significance
Archaeological research on the property has uncovered many stone artifacts, including ground-edge axes, anvils and hammer-stones, indicating that the land was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes in the coastal area for some 6,500 years. Remnants of indigenous settlement were also found on the property, which together with the artifacts show that the area was used as a storage area. The Department of Treasury and Finance conducted archeological investigations in the former explosives reserve in 1995 and 1996, during which consultants found six artifact sites but no scarred trees, hearths, hearth stones, bone remains or shell scatters.
The area is part of the traditional land of the Yalukit-willam clan, which settled in the coastal areas that stretch from the northern shores of Port Phillip to Wilson's Promontory. Little is known about the lifestyle of the Yalukit-willam clan. The Wurrundjeri Tribe Land Compensation Council and the Council of Cultural Heritage take care of the region's cultural heritage.
The name of the explosives reserve is derived from Truganini (1812-1876), who was long considered the last true Aboriginal Tasmanian. She was a daughter of the tribal elder Mananga of the Aborigines of Bruny Island.
Remains of buildings
The Truganina Explosives Reserve is listed under Hermes number 70270 in the Victorian Heritage Database Report. The historical attributes of the site are of Regional Significance. The site is still state owned and has been nominated for listing in the Victorian State Heritage Register. The Keepers Quarter residence is already listed as a local heritage by the Hobson's Bay City Council.
Remains of the tramway
Only little remains of the former tramway have survived. The only visible part of the route can be seen on the south side of the reserve, where it ran in a curve through a gate towards the pier. Some rails with the embossing "WIW Australia" and a crown symbol are embedded in a concrete channel. The crown symbol is probably a trademark of the Commonwealth Steel Company, whose Waratah Iron Works supplied many railways. The route then disappears there underneath the earthworks of a modern footpath.
The railway embankment, which was made of bluestone ballast, became visible during road works on the northeast corner of Queen Street and Merton Street. At this point the right of way of the narrow-gauge tramway line ran with a suitable radius over the property situated at the corner. Another section of the road is preserved near the ford westwards of Merton Street, again only as the earth dam, which turns west from the entrance to Laverton railway station and is partly overbuilt with a modern cycle path. The rails and sleepers are missing in these two sections and other sections of the routes within the reserve, but gravel and few metal artifacts are still visible. The sections within the reserve are either buried or overgrown.

Shaykh Najjar (, also spelled Sheikh Najjar) is an industrial city in northern Syria, administratively part of the Aleppo Governorate, located 10 kilometers northeast of Aleppo. Nearby localities include Kafr Saghir to the north, al-Muslimiyah to the northwest, Tell Shaghib to the south and Fah to the southeast. According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Shaykh Najjar had a population of 2,588 in the 2004 census.
Industrial city
Shaykh Najjar is a relatively new development and is the closest Syrian industrial center to the border with Turkey. By 2010–11, there were 1,923 companies operating in the industrial zone. About 40% of the firms inside the city are Turkish-owned. In addition to proximity, Turkish business owners benefit from tariff-free trade agreements between Syria and Turkey as well as the tariff-free exports of Turkish products made in Syria to the Arab world. Investors that open businesses inside the industrial zone are able to be assigned land and have the documents to proceed operations within 24 hours.
Shaykh Najjar is seen as one of the first urban developments built outside the ring roads of Aleppo. According to Anna I. Del Monaco, an Italian researcher of urban landscapes, Shaykh Najjar has the potential of reducing the "proliferation of industrial zones in the fabric inside the ring roads" and would absorb more workers from the countryside of Aleppo.
During the ongoing Syrian civil war which began in 2011, clashes between the opposition rebels and government forces have resulted in the destruction of hundreds of businesses in Aleppo, including in Shaykh Najjar. According to a Reuters report from 4 October 2012, the industrial zone "is now little more than a ghost town where guards try to protect some factories at great risk to their lives." By October 2012, around 20 pharmaceutical plants discontinued production, causing the potential risk of a medicine shortage. By April 2021, 685 establishments had returned to the industrial city.

¡Dos! (stylized in all caps) is the tenth studio album by American rock band Green Day. The album was released on November 9, 2012, in Australia, November 12 in the United Kingdom and on November 13 in the United States through Reprise Records. It is the second installment in the ¡Uno! ¡Dos! ¡Tré! trilogy. Following its predecessor's power pop style, ¡Dos! was billed as Green Day's take on garage rock.
The album accumulated the highest average reviews of all three trilogy albums, receiving generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised its dynamic style and catchy songs; others found its music dull and observed filler on the album. It debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 69,000 copies in the United States, a low for the band, becoming their first album since signing to a major record label to not sell 100,000 records in its first week.
Theme and composition
In an interview with Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, it was stated that ¡Dos! was going to have a "more garage rock—a little dirtier, like you're in the middle of the party" feel to it, similar to their side band Foxboro Hot Tubs. In a couple of interviews, Armstrong even went as far as calling ¡Dos! "the second Foxboro album." The track "Fuck Time", originally performed as a Foxboro Hot Tubs song, was recorded for the album, as was the track "Stray Heart".
Unlike the other two albums in the trilogy, this album features thirteen tracks instead of twelve. The final track "Amy" is dedicated to the late Amy Winehouse. The song "Nightlife" features guest vocals from Lady Cobra of the band Mystic Knights of the Cobra. The song is one of the slower and darker songs from the trilogy and has Lady Cobra rapping in her respective parts of the track. The album's tenth track, titled "Lady Cobra" is inspired by her. A black-and-white cutout of her with a sailor hat is seen on the back cover with her eye crossed out with a pink "X".
Release and promotion
A trailer for the album was released on June 21, 2012 on the band's YouTube channel, it included a preview of the song "Fuck Time". A preview of the song "Lazy Bones" was featured in a special Green Day themed level pack of Angry Birds Friends. Green Day also released previews of the songs "Stray Heart", "Makeout Party", "Wild One", "Fuck Time", "Lady Cobra" and "Nightlife" during an interview on BBC Radio One. A very short preview of the song "See You Tonight" was featured in one of their tour videos. On October 3, 2012, Green Day officially announced the track list for the album on their website. The songs "Stop When the Red Lights Flash", "Amy" and "Nightlife" were featured on the episode "Unspoken" of CSI: NY alongside "Kill the DJ" from ¡Uno! and "The Forgotten" from ¡Tré!, narrating the first dialogue-free 30 minutes of the episode. An official trailer was released on October 15 and featured previews of "Stop When the Red Lights Flash", "Fuck Time", and "Stray Heart". "Stop When the Red Lights Flash" is featured in the 2012 Electronic Arts racing game, Need For Speed: Most Wanted, and is included on the game's soundtrack album.
The album was officially released to listen by Green Day on the Rolling Stone website on November 6. Vinyl copies of ¡Dos! feature "Drama Queen" (from ¡Tré!) instead of "Stray Heart" due to the fact that they were pressed before the two tracks were swapped. A clean version of the track "Fuck Time" was released under the name "F-Woo Time".
Artwork
The band uploaded a trailer for the album on their official channel on YouTube showing the band in the recording studio as well as performing the song "Fuck Time" with their garage rock side band, Foxboro Hot Tubs. During the trailer the cover artwork for the album was revealed. It features a black-and-white cutout of Mike Dirnt, with his eyes crossed-out with pink X's, on a geometric, orange background. The words "Green Day" are loudly splashed in blue across the top of the cover, while the word "¡Dos!" is sprawled graffiti-style in white in the lower left-hand corner, much like the artwork for their previous album ¡Uno!
Singles
"Stray Heart" premiered on Idiot Club, Green Day's official fan club, on October 8, 2012, and premiered on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on the same day. It was later confirmed to be released as a single for the album on October 15 in the UK, and October 23 in the US. On October 18, it was announced on Idiot Club that fans could go to downtown LA to appear in the music video for "Stray Heart" on October 19. The video was released on November 7. The song reached number 10 on the Japan Billboard Japan Hot 100 in October. It was the only single to be released from the album.
Critical reception
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, ¡Dos! received an average score of 68, based on 24 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine complimented its "high-octane" style and called it a "terrific little party record." Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times commended Green Day for "allowing in a much wider range of sounds and styles", and found the album "way more impressive than the rudimentary math of Uno!", calling it "an excellent Green Day album — one of its best — a catchy, revealing work". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone wrote that Green Day "harness[es] the sound of immolating, teenage-wasteland lust for an album with a distinct sense of life coming off the rails". Scott Heisel of the Alternative Press felt that, apart from "Fuck Time" and "Nightlife", the album is "so focused and straightforward", and commented that despite some "rote" lyrics, Green Day "function[s] at their best with hook-filled songs that are typically three minutes or less." Despite noting a few "outright missteps", AJ Ramirez of PopMatters found the album generally "engaging" and dubbed it "the best Green Day studio album since American Idiot—given the uneven nature of the LPs in between, that's praise that demands qualifiers." Kerrang! complimented the album's "variety" and observed a "musical joie de vivre" throughout.
By contrast, Jason Heller of The A.V. Club perceived a lack of "joy" in the band's "garage-rock angle", writing that they "feel like they're writing a paper on the genre rather than celebrating it in song." Phil Mongredien of The Observer called the album "oddly leaden and largely witless", and criticized the band for "flailing ever further from the pop nous that has underscored their finest moments". Barry Nicolson of NME found ¡Dos! "too cluttered with filler to measure up against the best of the band's stuff." Slant Magazine's Jonathan Keefe wrote similarly, "only a handful of its tracks are truly essential additions to the Green Day catalogue." Mark Roche of State felt that it "has as many disappointing tracks as it does impressive ones" and observed from Green Day "the attempt to forge modern expectations with old school sensibility, even if it doesn't always work." Sputnikmusic's Joseph Viney felt that "Armstrong's lyrics are the biggest hindrance" and called the songs musically "limp". Jon Young of Spin felt that Armstrong "might want to abandon" his "juvenile posturing ... even the most seductive rascals lose their boyish allure eventually." Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly stated "scratch the party-till-you-puke surface and there's plenty of minor-key darkness lurking below, as in the bleary-eyed "Lazy Bones" and the lounge- lizard groove propping up "Nightlife.""
Commercial performance
The album debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 69,000 copies in the United States. The album has sold over 175,000 copies in the US. The album also debuted at number 10 in the UK with first-week sales of 24,613 and total sales of 91,870 as of October 13, 2016. ¡Dos! became the band's first album since their 1994 release Dookie that did not sell 100,000 copies in its first week.
Track listing
Notes
On the vinyl pressing, "Drama Queen" from ¡Tré! appears in place of "Stray Heart" due to it being printed before the tracks were switched between albums. Due to this, "Stray Heart" never saw a true vinyl release, with "Drama Queen" appearing both on ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!.

The Service Star (aka The Flag of Mothers) is an American silent film directed by Charles Miller. The film stars Madge Kennedy as a young woman who pretends to be the fiancée of a famous flying ace during World War I. The film was copyrighted under the title The Flag of Mothers and was released in July 1918, four months before the end of the conflict.
Plot
Marilyn March (Madge Kennedy), a plain young girl from the country, lonely and unhappy because she alone of all the girls in her town does not have a soldier sweetheart, When she moves to Washington, D.C. at the outbreak of World War I, she begins to pretend to be the fiancée of John Whitney Marshall (Clarence Oliver), a famous combat aviator, and places a service star in her window.
When Mrs. Marshall (Maude Turner Gordon) the flyer's mother, learns of the "engagement," she accepts the girl as her future daughter-in-law, just in time for complications to arise in the form of the truth. John is also harboring a secret; he is a chemist and is still in the United States working on a chemical weapon for the government. The combat flyer who is in France is an imposter he sent. Marilyn is torn over her affection for John and revealing to the Selective Service board that he is a fraud. Events transpire that turn John into a legitimate hero that Marilyn can accept as her true love.

Production
According to publicity for The Service Star, some scenes were shot in Washington, D.C., as well as in various towns in northern New Jersey, and on Long Island, New York. While on location in Long Island, a parade of American Civil War veterans who gave a tribute to drafted boys leaving for boot camp was incorporated into the film.
Reception
Like many American films of the time, The Service Star was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, in Reel 5, the Chicago Board of Censors cut the shooting of the chemist.
The Service Star is a lost film. During its original release, it was paired with a short Harold Lloyd comedy in some theaters.

DS2 (abbreviation of Dirty Sprite 2) is the third studio album by American rapper Future. It was released on July 17, 2015, through A1 Recordings and Freebandz, and distributed by Epic Records. The album serves as the sequel to his breakout mixtape, Dirty Sprite (2011). It features production from Metro Boomin, Southside, and Zaytoven, among others. The album was supported by three singles: "Fuck Up Some Commas", "Where Ya At", and "Stick Talk".
DS2 received generally positive reviews from critics, and was ranked as one of the best albums of 2015 and the decade by several publications. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, and it earned 151,000 units in its first week. By January 2016, the album sold 344,000 in the United States. In July 2022, the album was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
Background
On July 10, 2015, Future posted the cover artwork, while announcing that his new album would be called DS2, and would be released on July 17, 2015. The track list of the album was released on July 15, 2015.
Album artwork
The basis for the album's cover art is a stock photo sold through Shutterstock with the title "Color drop in water, photographed in motion. Ink swirling in water. Cloud of silky ink in water isolated on white background. Colorful ink in water, ink drop". The image was created by Sanja Tošić, an artist based in Slovenia. Although she did not know who Future was until The Fader contacted her to ask about the album art, Tošić said that she would buy a copy of his album.
Promotion
The album's lead single, "Fuck Up Some Commas", was released on March 2, 2015, the music video for the song was released on March 27. It peaked at number 55 on the US Billboard Hot 100.
The album's second single, "Where Ya At" featuring Drake, was released on July 16, 2015, the song peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100.
"Stick Talk" was later sent to rhythmic contemporary radio as the album's third single on February 1, 2016, the song peaked at number 91 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Critical reception
DS2 was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 22 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.3 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.
AllMusic wrote that with DS2 Future solidified himself as, "a strange and yet in command figure standing at the center of a slick, inventive swirl of music". Kris Ex of Billboard stated, "Produced by a handful of trusted Atlanta trap producers, DS2 is gothic, narcotic and full of overcast skies". Complex wrote of the album, "If you've followed Future's recent moves, DS2 is not unprecedented, but it greatly enhances the brooding ambiance of his recent work, a dive further into the abyss". Brian Josephs of Consequence stated, "DS2 is his strongest campaign yet, and it's the first time a new Future album has met all expectations". Calum Slingerland of Exclaim! wrote that "the majority of these beats hit to hurt, and though the emotional Future that listeners have come to know through past cuts "Throw Away" and "My Savages" has been dialed back, the honesty and vulnerability come through when it counts". Sheldon Pearce of HipHopDX stated, "Dirty Sprite 2 doesn't survey any new territory for the croaking crooner, but it magnifies the depth of his distress and channels it into an even richer multilayered sonic experience".
Chris Kelly of Fact said, "DS2 is a relentless, dud-free hour that adds in most of his recent highlights to complete the story of his last year". Reviewing the album's deluxe edition for Vice, Robert Christgau deemed DS2 a "miserable minor masterpiece" that is "all the proof we needed that money can't buy happiness". Brian Duricy of PopMatters said, "Self-mythologizing aside, the music on DS2 is worthy of the praise lauded on Future". Meaghan Garvey of Pitchfork stated, "Future was always straightforward, never ashamed to confess his depression or infatuation, but the narratives never felt so focused, nuanced, or vulnerable than here". Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone stated, "It has little of the far-reaching ambition of Honest, but what it lacks in bold stroke, it more than makes up for in consistency". Drew Millard of Spin stated, "Dirty Sprite 2 is a tremendous compendium of everything you want from a Future album in 2015". Vish Khanna of Now said, "In lieu of artistry or any semblance of lyrical spark, DST offers monotonous production and relentless chanting".
Rankings
Commercial performance
DS2 debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 151,000 album-equivalent units; it sold 126,000 copies in its first week. By January 2016, the album sold 344,000 copies domestically.

The grey tit (Melaniparus afer) is a species of bird in the tit family Paridae.
It is found in Lesotho and South Africa.
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry shrubland and Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation.
The grey tit was formerly one of the many species in the genus Parus but was moved to Melaniparus after a molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 showed that the members of the new genus formed a distinct clade.

Sir Robert Fanshawe, KCB, DSO (5 November 1863 – 24 August 1946) was a British Army officer, who commanded the 48th (South Midland) Division from 1915 to 1918 during the First World War. He was the youngest of three brothers (Edward, Hew, and Robert) who all rose to command divisions or corps during the war.
Fanshawe joined the Oxfordshire Light Infantry in 1883, and served with his regiment in India until the Second Boer War, where he commanded a mobile column and was mentioned in despatches. At the outbreak of the First World War he was on the staff of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and later commanded a regular brigade on the Western Front, before being promoted to divisional command in 1915. He commanded the 48th (South Midland) Division for three years, including service at the Somme, Ancre, Passchendale, and on the Italian Front, before being removed from command after his corps commander objected to his defensive strategy. He was relegated to commanding a second-line home service division, and retired from the army in 1918.
Early military career
Fanshawe was born in 1863, the youngest son of the Reverend Henry Leighton Fanshawe, of Chilworth, Oxfordshire. After attending Marlborough College, Fanshawe joined the 2nd Battalion of the newly formed Oxfordshire Light Infantry, the former 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot, in 1883. He spent the next sixteen years with the regiment, primarily on service in India, during which he was promoted to captain on 15 April 1892, and served in the Tirah Campaign of 1897–1898. He was the younger son of three brothers with significant military careers; Edward (b. 1859) joined the artillery and Hew (b. 1860) joined the cavalry, all three rising to command corps or divisions during the First World War.
He entered the Staff College, Camberley at the beginning of 1899, but following the outbreak of the Second Boer War, he was sent to South Africa that November, to serve on the Inspector-General's staff. He saw service at the Relief of Kimberley and the Battle of Paardeberg (February 1900), where he was wounded; later, in April 1900, he was made adjutant of the 6th Battalion Mounted Infantry, and on 2 September 1900 promoted to major. In 1901, he took command of a mobile column, which he commanded to the end of the war. He received the local rank of lieutenant colonel whilst holding this command, on 27 January 1902. For his service in South Africa, he was mentioned in despatches twice and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Following the end of the war in June 1902, Fanshawe returned to the United Kingdom in the SS Dunottar Castle, which arrived at Southampton the following month.
In September 1902 he was posted to the staff of the 4th Division on Salisbury Plain as deputy assistant adjutant-general, after he received the brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on 22 August 1902. He returned to his regiment in 1903. He commanded the 2nd Battalion from 1907 to 1911, when he was promoted colonel and posted as chief of staff (GSO.1) to the 1st Division.
First World War
At the outbreak of the First World War, Fanshawe's division was mobilised as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for service in France. On 20 September 1914, he was appointed an acting Brigadier-General to command the 6th Brigade, part of the 2nd Division.
He led the brigade through the First Battle of Ypres and the Battle of Festubert in early 1915, where it played a key part in the initial successful night attack. In mid-June, he was promoted to take over the 48th (South Midland) Division, a Territorial Force (TF) unit, after its previous General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Henry Heath, fell ill. He commanded the division at the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of the Ancre, and the Battle of Passchendaele, then on the Italian Front from late 1917 onwards, including the Austrian offensives of June 1918.
Fanshawe spent a good deal of time visiting front-line units, where he "liked to drift into the trench in an old raincoat so that men were not intimidated" and would sometimes venture out with a single escort to patrol no-man's land. More unusually, he had a habit of giving his soldiers chocolates when he met them returning from the lines or on inspections. Such behaviour scandalised his staff officers, who were privately disapproving of Fanshawe's informality with his troops but it did not lead to the disapproval of his superiors; in September 1917, a confidential report by Ivor Maxse, his corps commander, had judged him to be "a good average divisional commander and trainer".
Fanshawe was strongly in favour of elastic defence, where a lightly garrisoned front line would delay an enemy attack, and then a strong counter-attack would recapture lost ground, and had been training 48th Division in this mould since he took command in 1915; the Italian theatre was the first opportunity to put this approach fully into practice. The 48th Division was attacked on 15 June 1918 by the Austrians at the Battle of the Piave River; in keeping with the plan, leading elements fell back and a counter-attack was organised, recapturing the lost ground and stalling the offensive entirely.
Whilst a success, this result was greeted with dismay by the corps commander, the Earl of Cavan; he was a believer in a more traditional strongly held static line of defence and felt that Fanshawe did not need to have given up any ground at all. Fanshawe was quickly relieved of his command and ordered home, leaving Italy four days after the end of the battle, on 20 June.
Francis Mackay wrote that it was the dismissal of a general who had a sound defensive plan applied by officers and men of high morale and confidence.
The Italians, senior partners at Asiago, frequently sacked senior officers who had suffered setbacks in battle. Lord Cavan, who succeeded Herbert Plumer as GOC of the British Forces in Italy, may have played a political and unpleasant hand in dismissing Fanshawe.
Cavan thought that after his briefing of 14 June, Fanshawe should have reinforced the front line in the face of an expected Austrian attack. Cavan had also failed to spot the weaknesses and did not change the battle disposition when he visited Fanshawe at his battle headquarters.
As a commander, Fanshawe allowed his troops to suffer unnecessary casualties, which, in 1918, was a cause for dismissal.
Despite preparations for a British attack, there was no British artillery support to stem the Austrian advance.
MacKay also reports that the Official History records that Fanshawe may have lost his grip on the battle on the morning of 15 June 1918.
Fanshawe was respected throughout the 48th Division. He trained his commanders to use their initiative in the Battle of the Woods and Clouds, where lines of sight and communications were very limited. Yet his Battle Narrative is inadequate, inaccurate and trite, but it sheds no light on his sacking. He left, uncomplainingly, gentlemanly to the end and did not see further active service. Many officers in the 48th Division complained for years about his dishonourable treatment.
He was appointed to command the 69th (2nd East Anglian) Division on home service in November 1918. Through the war, he was mentioned in despatches eight times, as well as knighted.
After the war
He retired from the army in August 1919; he later served as the honorary colonel of the 1st/7th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment, a TF unit that formed part of the 48th Division. He died in 1946, aged eighty-three, after falling from his horse, and is buried near Oxford.

La Piñata Loca (English: "The Crazy Pinata") is an American children's programming block on Spanish language television network Univision, which debuted on March 30, 1996, and aired until February 26, 2000. The three-hour block aired Saturday and Sunday mornings from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time and Pacific Time and features animated series aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 11.
Programs featured on the block consist almost entirely of Spanish-dubbed versions of series that were originally produced and broadcast in English. All shows featured on La Piñata Loca are designed to meet federally mandated educational programming guidelines defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) via the Children's Television Act.
History
In April 1995, Univision test-marketed Plaza Sésamo ("Sesame Street"), Televisa and Children's Television Workshop's (now Sesame Workshop) Spanish-language adaptation of Sesame Street featuring a mix of original segments featuring characters based on its U.S.-based parent series and dubbed interstitials from the aforementioned originating program, on its owned-and-operated stations in Los Angeles, Dallas and Miami. The success of the test run led the network to begin airing the program nationally beginning on December 11 of that year; the program aired on Univision until 2002, when it moved to its newly created sister network TeleFutura as part of its "Mi Tele" ("My TV") block (the Univision network resumed its relationship with the now-Sesame Workshop when it debuted the U.S.-based Spanish language spin-off Sesame Amigos ("Sesame Friends") in August 2015). The network aired its children's programs on weekday and Saturday mornings until April 1997, when Univision relegated its children's programming exclusively to Saturday mornings to make room for its new morning news/talk/lifestyle program ¡Despierta América!.
La Piñata Loca
On March 30, 1996, Univision announced that it would launch a new Saturday and Sunday morning block, La Piñata Loca. The block was hosted by George Ortuzar (Lente Loco; after he left the show in 1995). The block and network opted to fully program the block with shows acquired from various programming distributors and entered in partnership with Hanna-Barbera and World Events Productions (based on the product anime show, Voltron: Defender of the Universe).
The block's initial lineup consisted mainly of Spanish-language and dubbed version of American, European and Japanese children's programs such as with The Flintstone Kids and Cantinflas y Sus Amigos (among with the cartoon series was premiered in 1993).
Giorgiomania
On August 16, 1997, Univision launched a sub-block within the lineup, called Giorgiomania, featuring dubbed version of the original series production by Film Roman during the first one-hour of the block on every Saturday morning such as Cro (based on Sesame Street) were the show to air as part of the sub-block.
In February 2000, after George "O" left from Univision, the block were discontinued. The following in few months, Univision entered launched as every Saturday morning, ¡De Cabeza!; among within featuring cartoon shows (The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat, Bruno the Kid and Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm; as part of the ending in 2001, three cartoon shows returned to the Univision's sister-network, Telefutura's children's block, Toonturama for the first time in nearly two-years).
Programming
All of the programs aired within the block featured content compliant with educational programming requirements as mandated by the Children's Television Act. Although the block was intended to air on Saturday mornings (such as Giorgiomania), some Univision affiliates deferred certain programs aired within the block to Sunday mornings, or (in the case of affiliates in the Western United States) Saturday afternoons due to select national sports broadcasts (especially in the case of 1998 FIFA World Cup soccer tournaments) scheduled in earlier Saturday timeslots as makegoods to comply with the E/I regulations.

Deo Tibba is a mountain located in Kullu District, Himachal Pradesh, India at a height of 5,985 metres. It is situated in the Pir Panjal Range of mountains. It lies to the southwest of Manali above Jagatsukh village. The first reconnaissance of Deo Tibba was made by General Bruce's guide, Furrer, who reported that one of its ridges looked climbable from the Hamta nala. The route to the summit of this peak has a challenging terrain- a climber has to cross over steep ice passes, glaciers with crevasses, rock fall area and moraine. The peak is exceptional in a way that the summit is not a pointed ridge but a snow dome just like an ice cap, with a flat summit plateau. It requires a load ferry, crossing technical terrain difficulties, using fixed ropes, crampons, ice axe etc. It is sometimes misunderstood as a beginner's peak for aspiring mountaineers as it is relatively lower when compared to Stok Kangri , but is less often climbed. Local and international teams attempt this peak often alongside Mt. Indrasan (6221 m), the two being connected via the high Duhangan Col. by
As per local beliefs, Deo Tibba is the assembly site of the gods. According to the Hindu mythology, the dome shaped peak of Deo Tibba is where the gods sit. Hence the name Deo meaning ‘Gods' and Tibba meaning ‘hill'.

Peratallada is a town in the municipality of Forallac, in the county of Baix Empordà, in Catalonia, Spain. It is located 22 km east of Girona.
Its name is derived from pedra tallada, meaning 'carved stone'. Declared a historic-artistic monument, most of the buildings are built from stone carved from the fosse or moat which still encircles parts of this small fortified medieval town. The privately owned Castle of Peratallada is the dominant structure in the center of the town, with a 13th-century Romanesque church dedicated to Sant Esteve (Saint Stephen) outside the town walls. The castle has been documented as early as 1065 AD and it was restored as a luxury hotel in the 1960s. During restoration, traces of settlement were found that date back to the Bronze Age.
Today, Peratallada is known for its beautiful old stone buildings, rutted stone streets and passageways. Its proximity to the beaches of the Costa Brava and its numerous restaurants, small boutique hotels and artists' galleries make it a popular destination. The 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was partly filmed on location here.
A festival – the Festa Major, is held every year in early August with concerts and activities and there is a medieval festival in the autumn.

Hodan Ahmed (; ) is a Somali political activist. She helped form the Somali Women Parliamentary Association the Transitional Federal Parliament of Somalia, which was succeeded by the Federal Parliament of Somalia. She serves as a Senior Program Officer at the National Democratic Institute.
Personal life
Ahmed was born in Somalia. After the start of the civil war in 1991, she and her family emigrated abroad.
Ahmed lived for a period in India. She later studied in Kenya.
In 2003, she returned to Somalia, traveling to the capital Mogadishu. Ahmed's visit there inspired her to devote her career to helping rebuild the country.
Career
Professionally, Ahmed initially worked with the United Nations Population Fund and Norwegian People's Aid. She later branched out, aiming to move beyond awareness-raising on key issues to finding sustainable political solutions for the Somali parliament.
In 2009, during workshops organized by the National Democratic Institute (NDI), Ahmed in conjunction with other Somali women civil society representatives and MPs established the Somali Women Parliamentary Association (SOWPA). It was the first women's caucus in the Somali Transitional Federal Parliament.
In 2010, Ahmed officially joined the NDI, where she assisted the Somali Transitional Federal Government's legislative strengthening program. The project provided training to women MPs in Somalia on parliamentary standards and protocols. It also brought together female parliamentarians and civil society representatives to advocate for women's issues. These collective efforts helped shape provisions within the new Federal Constitution, which was adopted in August 2012. Ahmed concurrently provided support for women political leaders to lobby for political representation. These efforts in turn culminated in a provision within Somalia's transitional roadmap process to reserve at least 30 percent of seats for women in the new Federal Parliament.
Under the aegis of the NDI's Andi Parhamovich Fellowship, Ahmed in 2013 worked for three months in Washington, D.C. She developed a program to equip women with the requisite leadership skills for participation in Somali politics and the post-conflict reconstruction process. Over the course of the fellowship, she also met with U.S. lawmakers and their staff, women's organizations, and the executive director of the Women Legislators of the Maryland General Assembly to learn effective strategies to improve cohesiveness between female MPs and civil society officials, including identifying areas of common concern and forming advocacy coalitions. Among these conferences was a keynote address by Ahmed in April 2013 at Marietta College's McDonough Leadership Center, as well as a speech the following month at the NDI's Madeleine K. Albright Grant Luncheon.
In June 2013, Ahmed returned to her NDI Somalia office to begin implementing her program. She is developing a training manual for Somali women MPs on basic government functions and leadership skills. She also hopes to hold workshops for women, and is working on improving equitable access to legislative training opportunities.
Awards
In 2013, Ahmed was presented the Andi Parhamovich Fellowship. The annual award is given to a young woman from the NDI or its partner organizations in 65 different nations who strengthen democratic institutionalization in her respective country through advancing female participation in politics.

Michael Ayers (born January 16, 1980) is an American ice hockey coach and former goaltender who was an All-American for New Hampshire.
Career
After graduating from Thayer Academy in 1998, Ayers spent another year playing prep school hockey before ending his junior career with the Dubuque Fighting Saints. Despite playing for the worst team in the USHL that season, Ayers was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks after the year. That fall, he began attending the University of New Hampshire and served as the team's third goaltender as a freshman. After Ty Conklin left in 2001, Ayers split time in goal with senior Matt Carney and helped the team finish atop the Hockey East standings. The two goalies were platooned through the Hockey East Tournament with Ayers in net for the Wildcats championship game victory. UNH got the top overall seed for the NCAA Tournament and Ayers got in goal for the team's semifinal match. Unfortunately, the team was outplayed by conference rival Maine and Ayers allowed 7 goals on 40 shots.
For his junior season, Ayers took over as the primary netminder and produced his best season yet. He set program records for wins, save percentage and shutouts, leading the team to a second consecutive conference title. Ayers backstopped the Wildcats to a conference championship and the team earned the third overall seed. In his second postseason run, Ayers was a clutch player for UNH, allowing 4 goals through three games, and led the program to only its second championship game. Facing down defending champion Minnesota, Ayers turned aside 29 of 30 shots through 40 minutes and had the Wildcats tied with the Gophers. However, the wheels came off in the third. Ayers surrendered three goals in a just over five minute span and New Hampshire lost the game 1–5. Ayers did return for his senior season, but both he and the team declined. While he finished with respectable numbers, they weren't enough to get him back onto the All-American team. New Hampshire did receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive season, but the team lost its opening match. While the ending was disappointing, Ayers did finish as the program's all-time wins leader (since broken).
After graduating with a degree in kinesiology, Ayers began playing professionally. He spent most of his first season in the ECHL and slowly worked his way up into the AHL. His numbers slid in his third season and he only saw limited minutes before finishing the season in Europe. He returned to the ECHL for one final season before ending his playing career in 2008.
Ayers began his second career after a short time off, becoming the goaltending coach for the Iowa Chops mid-season. He stayed with the team until the end of the year while pulling double-duty as a goaltending director for FHIT, a youth hockey organization in Minnesota. After leaving the Chops, Ayers founded his own goaltending academy, MVP Goaltending. He operated the business for just over two years. In the fall of 2009, he returned to the college ranks as an assistant for St. Cloud State. He attempted to hold three positions simultaneously, but left FHIT in November to focus on the newer positions. He remained an assistant coach and ran his goalie clinic until August 2011 when he joined USA Hockey full time as a goaltending coach. Among other duties, he served as an assistant on the US U-18 teams at the world championships in 2012 and 2013, winning a gold and silver medal respectively.
In 2013, he was lured back to college hockey, this time as an assistant for Boston College under Jerry York. Since then, he's helped develop two NHL goaltenders, Thatcher Demko and Spencer Knight. Prior to the 2020 season, Ayers was promoted to Associate Head coach, a position he continues to hold as of 2021.

The Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) is a meteorological observation network along the coastal United States. Consisting of about sixty stations installed on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms, the stations record atmospheric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are designed to also measure sea surface temperature, water level, waves, relative humidity, precipitation, and visibility.
The network is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) of the National Weather Service (NWS), which is part of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and data is ingested into numerical weather prediction computer models. It was created in the early 1980s to maintain observations that were about to be discontinued by other programs. Data is processed and transmitted similarly to the moored buoy system.
In 2002, C-MAN was added to the NOAA Observing System Architecture (NOSA).

USS YP-74 (ex-Endeavor) was a converted fishing vessel which served as an auxiliary patrol boat in the U.S. Navy during World War II.
History
She was built in Seattle, Washington for the benefit of M.C. Wright of Seattle. She was launched in April 1937, completed later in the year, configured as a purse seiner, and christened Endeavor. In November 1940, she was purchased by the United States Navy and commissioned in December 1940. She was designated as a Yard patrol boat (YP). Her armament consisted of a single 3"/23 caliber gun. She was assigned along with two other converted fishing vessels ( and ) to the newly created Alaska Sector of the 13th Naval District under Captain R. C. Parker who was tasked with building up the nearly absent Naval defenses of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. In December 1941, Lieutenant John Backland USNR was named commanding officer. Once in Alaska, she and her fellow YPs joined the former Coast Guard cutter and the gunboat to form what was colloquially called the "Alaskan Navy." Commandeer Charles E. ("Squeaky") Anderson, USNR, a "local character of infinite resource, energy, and cunning", was responsible for the YP fleet taking YP-72 as his flagship. In March 1942, Lieutenant George White Snyder was named commanding officer. On 6 September 1942, while en route with a group of Seabees, she collided with Alaska Steam Ship Company freighter SS Derblay in the fog off Unimak Island and sank at . Although there were 21 survivors, 2 crew members and 2 passengers did not survive. She was struck from the Naval List.

Bakht Buland Shah was a ruler of the Rajgond dynasty. He added to his kingdom, the territories of Chanda and Mandla, and portions of Nagpur, Balaghat, Seoni, Bhandara and the adjoining Rajput kingdom of Kherla/Khedla. The present districts of Chhindwara and Betul also fell under his control. A great warrior, he went on to conquer Pauni, Dongartal, Sivni & Katangi.
Ascension to the throne
Bakht Buland's initial name was Bhagtu. After his father Kok Shah's death, a war of succession broke out. He was the younger son of Gorakh Shah, the Gond ruler of Deogarh. To save his throne from his brother, Bakht Buland went to Delhi in 1686 and reluctantly accepted Islam to get military assistance from the emperor Aurangzeb against his brother but with an understanding that he would dine with Muslims but continue to accept brides from the Gonds. As a result, his descendants continued to have marital relations with the Rajgonds and performed marriages according to Hindu rites followed by those of the Islamic religion. In exchange, he was recognized as the Raja of Deogarh. With Aurangzeb's help, he was firmly established as the ruler of Deogarh in 1668.
Reign
Bakht Buland Shah later rebelled against the Mughals in 1700 and snatch portions of their territory, when the empire had grown weak due to the long Mughal war against the Marathas. He even plundered the Mughal territory on both sides of the Wardha. Thus Deogarh, for a brief period, stood as a semi-independent or practically independent kingdom. Thus he earned the disfavour of Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb thereupon ordered that the title Bakht Buland meaning ‘of high fortune' should be changed to Nigun Bakht-of mean fortune. Nothing is known of the army sent to punish Bakht.
He was ceded the district of Seoni, Chauri, Dongartal and Ghansour by Narendra Shah of Mandla for his aid against the latter's cousins. He also added the domain of the Gond rajas of Chanda to his domain. His kingdom included the present day districts of Chhindwara, Betul, Balaghat, Sivni (Seoni) and Bhandara.
History idolizes him as the founder of the Nagpur city. Bakht Buland Shah founded the city of Nagpur in 1702/1703 (according to different sources) by joining the twelve small villages formerly known as Rajapur Barsa or Barasta. He built roads and a strong wall around the city.
In 1702 Many towns and villages were founded. All the smaller villages were merged. According to Sir Richard Jenkins- "He indiscriminately employed Musalmans and Hindus of ability to introduce order and regularity into his immediate domain. Industrious settlers from all quarters were attracted to Gondwana, thousands of villages were founded, and agriculture, manufacture and even commerce made considerable advances. It may be said that much of the success of the Maratha administration was owing to the groundwork established by him."
After giving a proper shape to his kingdom, he encouraged people to settle and thus facilitated trade & Commerce. His rule epitomizes an era of great reforms. Agriculture, trade, and commerce made considerable advances. He constructed a Mosque in the Fort of Nagpur which initiated the Islamic religion & culture in Nagpur. He died in about 1706 and was succeeded by his elder son Chand Sultan.

Operation Tariq al-Qods (, meaning "Path to Qods") was a military operation launched by Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to free Bostan, which was fought from 29 November to 7 December 1981. The operation was carried out jointly by the Iranian army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
As a result of the operation, besides liberation of Bostan, 70 villages were also freed. The news of Bostan liberation, was the first instance when the liberation news a city was released during the Iran-Iraq war. The Iranian success was labeled by Khomeini, Iran Supreme leader at the time, as "the victory of victories".
Before the battle
Iran tried to regain control over Bostan town, Khuzestan, in August 1981 which was not successful.
Operation planning
The operation was designed by two independent groups affiliated with IRGC and Iranian army respectively under supervision of Mohsen Rezaei and Ali Sayyad Shirazi. The planning groups selected Dashte-e Azadegan zone for the operation where Iranian troops would require fewer forces and equipment for victory. Moreover, the area included Chazabeh where its capture could divide the Iraqi forces located in north and south of Khuzestan province. More reconnaissance was then carried out before the operation.
Reconnaissance
The reconnaissance operations were carried out under observation of Hassan Baqeri and according to one of the reconnaissance forces, the Iraqi troops in the operation zone were watched on an hourly basis. After reviewing the reports issued by the operation intelligence unit, Baqeri advised the attack be conducted via the Chazabeh, which was a sandy and impassable route. The suggestion was objected at the beginning, but later gained the satisfaction of the Iranian Army commanders. Also, Jahad of Construction declared that it could construct a road, which would increase the possibility of victory for the Iranian side. A 9 km long road was constructed by Jahad of Construction consequently. This road allowed a substantial number of the Iranian troops "on the northern flank of the Iraqi defenses."
The battle
The Operation was launched on 29 November 1981 and lasted more than a week. Sixty tanks and 20,000 soldiers were dispatched towards Bostan for the operation. The Iranians used human wave attacks in their offensive for the first time in the war. Around 13,000 Iranian troops were fighting in the operation, more than half of which were IRGC forces. Fierce fighting raged with the Iraqi defenders for one week. The Iranians were able to liberate Bostan. During the operation Iran lost more than twice as many men as the Iraqis. Even so, the attrition rate was in Iran's favor. Iran was now able to eliminate an important supply route. This was extremely critical because Iraq did not have enough soldiers for a long front line. 2,500 Iraqis and 6,000 Iranians were killed in the fighting. After almost 36 hours the Iranian troops retook Bostan and repelled the Iraqi forces away towards the west by several kilometers.
Iranian attack
In the evening of 28 November 1981, when it was becoming dark, the road through Chazabeh strait, constructed by Jahad forces, were marked using lanterns by the operation intelligence forces. Five minutes after the mid night of 29 November 1981, the commanders announced the 'Ya Hossein' (O Hossein !) signaling the initiation of the operation. The attack was carried out via two columns, one on the north axis and one on the south. In the north axis, the Iranian troops reached the Artillery unit of Iraq before they woke up, and after an intense fight the Iranian side won the battle leading to the conquest of the Iraq's artillery unit. In the south axis, Iraqi troops were higher in numbers making the fight more difficult for the Iranian forces. Hence, some of the north forces were dispatched to south. Bostan was liberated in the morning of 29 November 1981 and the news was sent to Tehran marking the first news about the liberation of a city during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraqi forces did not expect an attack due to the poor conditions.
Iraqi counter attack
Iraqi forces conducted a counter attack in the south axis. After three days of fighting, Iraq's counter attack was defeated by the Iranian side. On the 6th of November 1981, the Iranian forces were surprised by the Iraqi commandos trying to cross the Saboleh bridge. Seven Iraqi tanks passed over the Saboleh bridge threatening Bostan city. The two sides exchanged fire and the Iraqi tanks were captured by Iran leading to the retreat of the Iraqi forces.

Electrically operated display devices have developed from electromechanical systems for display of text, up to all-electronic devices capable of full-motion 3D color graphic displays. Electromagnetic devices, using a solenoid coil to control a visible flag or flap, were the earliest type, and were used for text displays such as stock market prices and arrival/departure display times. The cathode ray tube was the workhorse of text and video display technology for several decades until being displaced by plasma, liquid crystal (LCD), and solid-state devices such as thin-film transistors (TFTs), LEDs and OLEDs. With the advent of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), integrated circuit (IC) chips, microprocessors, and microelectronic devices, many more individual picture elements ("pixels") could be incorporated into one display device, allowing graphic displays and video.
Cathode ray tube
One of the earliest electronic displays is the cathode ray tube (CRT), which was first demonstrated in 1897 and made commercial in 1922. The CRT consists of an electron gun that forms images by firing electrons onto a phosphor-coated screen. The earliest CRTs were monochrome and were used primarily in oscilloscopes and black and white televisions. The first commercial colour CRT was produced in 1954. CRTs were the single most popular display technology used in television sets and computer monitors for over half a century; it was not until the 2000s that LCDs began to gradually replace them.
A derivative of CRTs were storage tubes, which had the ability to retain information displayed on them, unlike standard CRTs which need to be refreshed periodically. In 1968, Tektronix introduced the Direct-View Bistable Storage Tube, which went on to be widely used in oscilloscopes and computer terminals.

"Noose of Ice" is the 23rd episode of Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, a British Supermarionation television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and filmed by their production company Century 21 Productions. Written by Peter Curran and David Williams and directed by Ken Turner, it was first broadcast on 12 March 1968 on ATV Midlands.
Set in 2068, the series depicts a "war of nerves" between Earth and the Mysterons: a hostile race of Martians with the power to create functioning copies of destroyed people or objects and use them to carry out acts of aggression against humanity. Earth is defended by a military organisation called Spectrum, whose top agent, Captain Scarlet, was murdered by the Mysterons and replaced by a reconstruction that later broke free of their control. Scarlet's double has a self-healing power that enables him to recover from injuries that would be fatal to anyone else, making him Spectrum's best asset in its fight against the Mysterons.
In "Noose of Ice", the Mysterons target an undersea Arctic mine that is extracting a rare metal which is vital to the construction of a new Earth space fleet.
Plot
A new space fleet is being built to enable Earth to launch a counter-offensive against the Mysterons on Mars. To shorten the journey time to the Red Planet, the Space Administration is fortifying the ships with tritonium metal, allowing them to travel faster while withstanding the higher stresses. Tritonium is found only at the North Pole, where the Hotspot Tower mining facility is extracting it from the ocean floor.
When the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) threaten to sabotage the space fleet, Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) sends Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) to the Space Administration Headquarters in New York City to be briefed by the head of the Administration, General Rebus. Scarlet and Blue then travel to the Arctic to assess the security at Hotspot Tower. The controller, Commander Rhodes, tells them that the lake around the tower and the undersea mine is prevented from freezing thanks to giant heating elements powered by electric current originating from Eskimo Booster Station.
Unknown to Scarlet, Blue and Rhodes, a maintenance technician, Neilson, has been killed in a blizzard and replaced with a double under Mysteron control. On the orders of Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray), the double travels to the booster station and cuts the power to the heating elements. The rapidly-freezing lake forms a "noose of ice" that threatens to crush the mining facility.
With all lifts to the surface rendered inoperative, Scarlet puts on an underwater suit and exits the mine through an airlock. He then races to the booster station, where Neilson holds him at gunpoint. Scarlet throws a loose electric cable at the metal stairs on which Neilson is standing, fatally electrocuting the Mysteron agent. He then restores the power to the heating elements, melting the ice and saving Hotspot Tower. However, the Mysterons have had a partial success: the mine is severely damaged and will be out of operation for at least six months.
Production
The closing credits incorrectly state that the episode was written by Tony Barwick. "Noose of Ice" follows on directly from Barwick's episode "Flight 104", in which the nature of Earth's return to Mars has yet to be decided. Although "Noose of Ice" was filmed and originally broadcast after "Flight 104", the running order published by distributor ITC Entertainment places it before that episode, disrupting the series continuity.
The mine tower was designed by special effects assistant Mike Trim. To allow for more realistic effects shots, parts of the miniature filming model were built in a scale larger than what Century 21 normally used. Parts of the mine control room set first appeared in the film Thunderbirds Are Go (1966), while the booster station interior recycled elements of the Skyship One gravity compensator room from Thunderbird 6 (1968). The scale model representing the Space Administration building was a re-use of the SHEF Headquarters exterior from the episode "Point 783".
Some of the incidental music was originally composed for Stingray and Thunderbirds. Scenes featuring music from these earlier productions include Neilson's death in the blizzard, the ice forming around Hotspot Tower and the closing scene of the episode.
The puppet playing Neilson first appeared as Captain Brown in "The Mysterons". "Noose of Ice" marked the fourth occasion in which the puppet's character was killed and reconstructed by the Mysterons: it had also previously played Major Reeves in "Renegade Rocket" and Professor Carney in "Codename Europa". It also appeared as supporting characters in "Flight 104", "Special Assignment" and "Fire at Rig 15". The puppet playing General Rebus also appeared as the Base Concord Commander in "Renegade Rocket" and non-speaking background characters in "Special Assignment" and "Seek and Destroy". The Hotspot Tower guard had previously played Jason Smith in "Fire at Rig 15". Commander Rhodes later appeared as the regular character Sam Loover in Joe 90.
Reception
Andrew Thomas of Dreamwatch magazine regards "Noose of Ice" as one of the series' best episodes. He praises the episode for highlighting the vulnerability of Scarlet, a former Mysteron agent, to electric current: "there is a very real danger that Scarlet may be electrocuted when re-connecting the power supply."
In contrast, writer Fred McNamara considers "Noose of Ice" to be one of the series' "more disposable" instalments, criticising its "interminable exposition" and what he regards as a lack of action. Commenting that it features "little else [...] other than characters sitting and talking, or standing and talking", McNamara believes that the episode is let down by the fact that plot elements like the space fleet and the actual mining operation are continually mentioned but never seen on screen. He calls "Noose of Ice" a "bloodthirsty" story, noting the "graphic" electrocution of Neilson's Mysteron double, and expresses disappointment with the time-lapse model shots of ice forming around Hotspot Tower, suggesting that realistic simulations of expanding ice were beyond the abilities of Century 21's special effects unit.
Geoff Willmetts considers the episode, with its "freezing water", to be "one of the cleverest from a special effects point of view", while Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine calls it "superlative in the miniatures department". Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of Starburst magazine cite Neilson's electrocution as one of the series' most violent moments.

The 32-foot Transportable Port Security Boat (TPSB) or (32' TPSB), normally operated by United States Coast Guard Port Security Units (PSUs), provides for defense readiness operations in the United States and when PSUs are deployed overseas. It travels at 43-plus knots, and carries up to two .50 caliber M2 Machine Guns and two 7.62mm M240G Machine Guns. There are 52 in operation.
The TPSBs perform a variety of missions such has Military Readiness, PWCS (Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security), Maritime Law Enforcement, Defense Operations, and limited Search and Rescue.
Design
The boats are made of aluminum, designed using Solidworks CAD software in 2010 by Brian M. Shumway, and manufactured in Fairhaven, WA by Aluminum Chambered Boats (ACB) under the supervision of engineer and engineering manager Brady O'hare. The design of the fourth-generation TPSB emphasizes crew protection and comfort over previous TPSBs. To achieve improved comfort and survivability, the TPSBs have greater protection due to the use of ballistic panels. Ballistic protection allows the crew to continue to perform their mission even if fired upon. Comforts improvements come in the use of shock mitigating seats, and better stability. The boats can be transported by plane, or by vehicle with a trailer.

The New Armies (Traditional Chinese: 新軍, Simplified Chinese: 新军; Pinyin: Xīnjūn, Manchu: Ice cooha), more fully called the Newly Created Army ( Xinjian Lujun), was the modernised army corps formed under the Qing dynasty in December 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. It was envisioned as militia fully trained and equipped according to Western standards. In 1903 an imperial edict expanded it to 36 divisions of 12,500 men each, or total of 450,000. It was known as the Beiyang Army, and was under the command of Yuan Shikai.
Formation and expansion
There was a forerunner to the effort of modernising the Chinese army, created before the end of the Sino-Japanese War: in February 1895, the Qing court assembled its Dingwu or the Pacification Army ( Dingwu jun), consisting of 10 battalions or ying (), totaling 4,750 men. This was initially organized by aided by German advisor Constantin von Hanneken
The command of this Pacification Army was turned over to Yuan Shikai by mid-December 1895, and within a few months was renamed the Newly Created Army ( Xinjian Lujun) and expanded to 7,000 men. (Yuan's Newly Created Army was later to become the Guards Army's Right Division (Wuwei Youjun).)
The Newly Created Army (or simply the New Army) that was 7,000 men strong then became the most formidable of the three army groups stationed near Beijing and proved effective against the Boxers in Shandong province. Yuan refused to obey the Imperial Court's orders to halt his suppression of the Boxers when the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China during the rebellion and refused to obey orders to fight the alliance.
The New Army was gradually expanded and upgraded in the following years. Yuan became increasingly disrespectful of the dynasty and only loyal to the party from which he benefited; his defection to Cixi against the Guangxu Emperor was a major blow to the Hundred Days' Reform. After 1900, Yuan's troops were the only militia that the Qing court could rely on amidst revolutionary uprisings throughout China.
Renaming and revolution
The Chien Men gate refers to the Zhengyangmen.
The successful example of the new army was followed in other provinces. The New Army of Yuan was renamed the Beiyang Army on June 25, 1902 after Yuan was officially promoted to the "Minister of Beiyang". By the end of the dynasty in 1911, most provinces had established sizable new armies; however, Yuan's army was still most powerful, comprising six groups and numbering more than 75,000 men. The Qing unified all of China's armies into one force, the "Chinese Army", which was commonly still called the New Army. Two-thirds of the Chinese Army was Yuan's Beiyang Army.
During the Xinhai Revolution, most of the non-Beiyang forces as well as some Beiyang units in the Chinese Army revolted against the Qing. Yuan led the Beiyang Army into opposing the revolution while also negotiating for the Qing's surrender and his ascendency to the presidency of the new republic.
Politics and modernisation
Yuan kept a tight grip on the command of the army after its establishment by installing officials only loyal to him; however, after his death in 1916, the army groups were quickly fragmented into four major forces of combative warlords, according to the locations of garrisons. These army groups and generals played different roles in the politics of the Republic of China until the establishment of the People's Republic of China following the Communist Party of China's victory in the Chinese Civil War.
One of the most important legacies of the New Army was the professionalisation of the military and perhaps introduction of militarism to China. Previously, almost any male could join and soldiers were mostly poor, landless and illiterate peasants. The New Armies moved beyond the personalised recruitment and patronage of Zeng Guofan and Zuo Zongtang, which had been successful in the mid-century uprisings, but seemed discredited in the face of modern armies in Japan and the West. The New Army began screening volunteers and created modern military academies to train officers. The modernisation and professionalisation of the New Army impressed many in the gentry class to join. The young Chiang Kai-shek, for instance, briefly attended Yuan's Baoding Military Academy, which thus influenced him in forming his Whampoa Academy, which trained a succeeding generation of soldiers. Yuan and his successors equated military dominance of the political sphere with national survival. The political army would become a dominant force in China for much of the twentieth century.

Maurus Corker (baptised James; 1636 – 22 December 1715) was an English Benedictine who was falsely accused and imprisoned as a result of the fabricated Popish Plot, but was acquitted of treason and eventually released.
Life
He was born in Yorkshire. His baptismal name was James: he took the name Maurus when he entered the Benedictine order. On 23 April 1656, he took vows at the English Benedictine house Lamspringe Abbey near Hildesheim, in Germany, and returned to England as a missionary in 1665.
Popish Plot
Being accused by Titus Oates of collusion in the Popish Plot, (which was in fact Oates's own invention), he was imprisoned in Newgate Prison, but was acquitted of treason by a London jury, 18 July 1679. His acquittal was due in part to his own eloquent defence (he has been described as one of the ablest priests of his generation), and in part due to his good fortune in being tried with Sir George Wakeman, personal physician to Queen Catherine of Braganza. The Crown was determined to save Wakeman, and Lord Chief Justice William Scroggs, formerly a firm believer in the Plot, now turned on Oates and the other informers, denouncing them as liars. Despite his notorious antipathy to Catholic priests, Scroggs made no effort to distinguish between Wakeman and the three priests who were tried with him, warning the jury that no accused person, priest or layman, should suffer death for treason if there was any doubt as to their guilt.
Corker was returned to prison, and was then arraigned for acting as a priest within England, an offence which carried the death penalty under the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, although after the death of Elizabeth I the law had fallen into disuse until the advent of the Popish Plot. He was tried with six others, including the leading Dominican Lionel Anderson, and the colourful, one-legged Civil War veteran Colonel Henry Starkey. One of the seven, David Kemiss (or Kemish), was found unfit to plead on the grounds of his great age and ill-health, while another, Alexander Lumsden, was acquitted, on the ground that he was a Scot, not an Englishman, and therefore could not be said to have "acted as a priest in England" within the meaning of the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584.
The other accused, including Corker. were found guilty and sentenced to death under the Act of 1584 on 17 January 1680. Through influential friends Corker was granted a reprieve (in fact it does not seem that any of the convicted priests were executed, and the aged David Kemiss was allowed to die in prison) and he was detained in Newgate. While thus confined he is said in some reports to have converted more than a thousand Protestants to Catholicism.
After the Plot
One of his fellow-prisoners at Newgate was Oliver Plunkett, Archbishop of Armagh, with whom he formed a close friendship, and whom he prepared for his execution, which took place on 11 July 1681. Some correspondence which was carried on in prison between these two was later published. On the accession of James II of England in 1685, Father Corker was released and kept at the court as resident ambassador of Prince-Bishop Ferdinand of Bavaria, the Elector of Cologne. In 1687 he erected the little convent of St. John at Clerkenwell, where religious services were held for the public, but which was destroyed by a mob, 11 November 1688, during the Glorious Revolution. Father Corker himself was obliged to seek refuge on the continent. In 1691 he was made Abbot of Cismar Abbey near Lübeck and, two years later, of Lamspringe, where he had made his religious profession. In 1696 he resigned as abbot and returned to England to continue his missionary work. He died in Paddington.
Works
He was the author of various pamphlets on the innocence of those condemned for implication in the Popish Plot.
A treatise Roman Catholick Principles in reference to God and the King ran to dozens of editions and caused a controversy among English Catholics in the nineteenth century, over the issue of the accuracy with which it represented Catholic doctrine. It first appeared as a small pamphlet in 1680, and at least two other editions of it were published in that year. It is reprinted in Stafford's Memoires. Six editions of the Principles were published before 1684, and six were published by Goter in 1684-6 at the end of his Papist misrepresented and represented. William Coppinger gave at least twelve editions of the 'Principles, first in his Exposition, and afterwards in his True Piety. Eleven or twelve more editions were published between 1748 and 1813, and a reprint appeared in the Pamphleteer in 1819, and again with the title of The Catholic Eirenicon, in friendly response to Dr. Pusey, London 1865. On reading it Dr. Leland, the historian, is said to have declared that if such were the principles of Catholics no government had any right to quarrel with them. Charles Butler, who reprinted it, declared it to be a clear and accurate exposition of the Catholic creed on some of its most important principles. John Milner, however, asserted in an official charge to his clergy in 1813 that it "is not an accurate exposition of Roman catholic principles, and still less the faith of catholics". Butler claimed that John Joseph Hornyold had used Corker's work in his The Real Principles of Catholicks (1749), but Milner denied this. In consequence of some exceptions taken against the accuracy of the 'Propositions' which form the heading of The Faith of Catholics by Joseph Berington and John Kirk, Kirk reprinted Corker's treatise in 1815.

The Oakland neighborhood in Fountain City, Tennessee, now included in north Knoxville, Tennessee, was a small, segregated, black community south of Tazewell Pike and west of Beverly Place and Beverly Road. It had a small, segregated, black elementary school, which was boarded up for many years once the Knoxville schools were integrated, and eventually was used for a children's museum.
Nearby white schools were Shannondale, to the north and east on Shannondale Road, and Smithwood (defunct), to the north and west, near the intersection of Tazewell Pike with Jaxboro Pike that is eponymously also known as Smithwood. Next to the north is the ornate Smithwood Baptist Church, and there was once also Smithwood Drugstore and Smithwood Taxicab Service (one vehicle operated out of the Sinclair service station by the owner, "Dub" Tipton.

23:59 is a 2011 Singaporean-Malaysian horror film directed by Gilbert Chan.
Plot
In 1983, a platoon of recruits is about to complete basic training on a jungle island (based on Pulau Tekong). They hear a ghost story which says that a mad woman living on the island had died at 23:59 (11:59 PM) and her spirit would return to haunt the camp at the same time. Tan, the platoon outcast, tries to convince his buddy, Jeremy, that he is being haunted by the woman's ghost, but Jeremy does not believe him.
When the platoon embarks on a route march in the jungle, Tan goes missing and ends up being found dead. Although the recruits and their sergeant believe that Tan's death was due to supernatural forces, their officer insists that it was an accident. Jeremy has a nightmare about seeing Tan's ghost indicating that Chester, another recruit, will be next to die.
The following night, Chester is possessed by a spirit and has to be restrained until a priest is called in to exorcise him. Jeremy later confronts Chester about Tan's death and learns that Chester and Tan had encountered the ghost of a woman on the night they did guard duty together. Jeremy has also seen the same ghost a few times since the night of Tan's death.
Jeremy and Chester ask a local and find out that the woman was a medium who had given birth to a deformed girl. The girl grew up being ostracised due to her appearance and because she and her mother were believed to be cursed.
That night, Chester and Jeremy hear a strange noise and follow it into the jungle, where Chester is killed by an unseen force. Jeremy injures his leg while trying to flee and unknowingly takes shelter in the medium's house. He finds the medium's skeleton on a rocking chair and encounters her ghost again. She tells him that she was not responsible for the recruits' deaths; it was actually her daughter's ghost who killed them. It turns out that years ago, the medium had poisoned her daughter to death and then committed suicide. Jeremy is possessed by the medium's ghost, who apologises and reconciles with her daughter's ghost. The sergeant and two recruits eventually find Jeremy in the house. He recovers and returns home safely after completing basic training.
In the present day, three recruits talk about the same ghost story on the island. When it is 23:59, they hear the same strange noise.

General elections were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina on 7 October 2018. They decided the makeup of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Presidency as well as national, entity, and cantonal governments. Voter turnout was 53.36%.
The elections for the House of Representatives were divided into two; one for the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and one for Republika Srpska. In the presidential election, each of the three national communities elected a Presidency member. Bosniaks elected Šefik Džaferović, Croats elected Željko Komšić and Serbs elected Milorad Dodik. The Party of Democratic Action emerged as the largest party in the House of Representatives, winning 9 of the 42 seats.
Electoral system
The three members of the Presidency are elected by plurality. In Republika Srpska voters elect the Serb representative, whilst in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina voters elect the Bosniak and Croat members. Voters registered in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina can vote for either the Bosniak or Croat candidate, but cannot vote in both elections.
The 42 members of the House of Representatives are elected by open list proportional representation in two constituencies, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. These two constituencies are subsequently divided in eight electoral units.
A total of 3,352,933 citizens were registered to vote; 2,092,336 in the Federation and 1,260,597 in Republika Srpska (citizens living in Brčko District voted in one of the entities). There were 77,814 persons registered to vote outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina, out of which 76,729 persons were registered to vote by mail and 1,085 were registered to vote at diplomatic missions.
Results
Turnout at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina was 53.36%; the Federation 51.25%; Republika Srpska 57.30% and Brčko District 46.81%. The percentage was slightly lower than compared to 2014 that was 54.14%. The Bosnian Central Election Commission (CEC) reported that all 5,714 polling stations closed down in time or with slight delay. According to the initial assessment by the CEC, the elections passed in an overall calm and peaceful atmosphere.
Presidency
The elected members of the national Presidency were Šefik Džaferović (Bosniak, SDA), Željko Komšić (Croat, DF) and Milorad Dodik (Serb, SNSD). There was controversy over the election of the Croat member, as the non-nationalist candidate Željko Komšić (Democratic Front) won against the nationalist Dragan Čović (HDZ BiH) with the help of Bosniak voters, with Komšić winning first place almost exclusively in municipalities without a Croat relative majority. The result prompted protests of Croats accusing Bosniaks of out-voting and calling for the creation of their own entity or electoral constituency. In the following days, protests were held in Mostar with signs "Not my president".
In the days following election, several municipalities with Croat majority declared Komšić persona non grata.

By entity
Reactions
Following the results and Željko Komšić's election to the Presidency, largely due to votes in majority Bosniak areas, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, who endorsed the incumbent Presidency member Dragan Čović, criticized Komšić's victory: "We are again in a situation where members of one constituent people ... are electing a representative of another, the Croat people". Komšić responded that the Croatian Government is undermining Bosnia and Herzegovina and its sovereignty.

Drongelen is a village in the Dutch province of North Brabant. It is located in the municipality of Altena.
The village was first mentioned in 1270 as de Drungele, and might mean "open forest near the Drongel river".
The church of Drongelen was destroyed by a flood in 1509, and not rebuilt until 1700. In November and December 1944, almost the entire village and the church were destroyed during the fighting between the Allied Forces and the German army. A wooden church was donated by Sweden as a temporary church. In 1951, a new church was rebuilt. The wooden church was moved to Amstelveen where it burnt down in 2000.
Drongelen was home to 358 people in 1840. The school closed in 1984 and became the village house. There is a free car ferry between Drongen and Waalwijk.
Drongelen was a separate municipality until 1923, when it was merged with Eethen. Before 1908, the name of the municipality was Drongelen, Haagoort, Gansoijen en Doeveren.

The trade-weighted US dollar index, also known as the broad index, is a measure of the value of the United States dollar relative to other world currencies. It is a trade weighted index that improves on the older U.S. Dollar Index by using more currencies and the updating the weights yearly (rather than never). The base index value is 100 in Jan 1997. As the U.S. Dollar gains value the index increases.
History
The trade-weighted dollar index was introduced in 1998 for two primary reasons. The first was the introduction of the euro, which eliminated several of the currencies in the standard dollar index; the second was to keep pace with new developments in US trade.
Included currencies
In the older U.S. Dollar Index, a significant weight is given to the euro, because most U. S. Trade in 1973 was with European countries. As U. S. trade expanded over time, the weights in that index went unchanged and became out of date. To more accurately reflect the strength of the dollar relative to other world currencies, the Federal Reserve created the trade-weighted US dollar index, which includes a bigger collection of currencies than the US dollar index. The regions included are:
Europe (euro countries)
Canada
Japan
Mexico
China
United Kingdom
Taiwan
Korea
Singapore
Hong Kong
Malaysia
Brazil
Switzerland
Thailand
Philippines
Australia
Indonesia
India
Israel
Saudi Arabia
Russia
Sweden
Argentina
Venezuela
Chile
Colombia
Mathematical formulation
Based on nominal exchange rates
The index is computed as the geometric mean of the bilateral exchange rates of the included currencies. The weight assigned to the value of each currency in the calculation is based on trade data, and is updated annually (the value of the index itself is updated much more frequently than the weightings). The index value at time is given by the formula:
.
where
and are the values of the index at times and
is the number of currencies in the index at time
and are the amount of currency required to purchase one U.S. Dollar at times and
is the weight of currency at time
and
Based on real exchange rates
The real exchange rate is a more informative measure of the dollar's worth since it accounts for countries whose currencies experience differing rates of inflation from that of the United States. This is compensated for by adjusting the exchange rates in the formula using the consumer price index of the respective countries. In this more general case the index value is given by:
.
where
and are the values of the US consumer price index at times and
and and are the values of the country 's consumer price index at times and
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, provides "weighted averages of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of a broad group of major U.S. trading partners" with detailed information. The "broad currency index includes the Euro Area, Canada, Japan, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Brazil, Switzerland, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Sweden, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile and Colombia."

John Francis Carmont, Lord Carmont (30 October 1880 – 7 August 1965) was a senior Scottish High Court Judge.
Early life
Carmont was born in Dumfries, the youngest son of James Carmont, an honorary Sheriff substitute. He was educated at the Fort Augustus Abbey until December 1894 when he transferred to St Bede's College, Manchester, for a year. In 1895 he was sent to France to complete his education.
Early career
Upon returning to Dumfries, Carmont served an apprenticeship with a local law firm and qualified as a solicitor in 1903, he then studied further law at Edinburgh University and was called to the bar in 1906, taking silk in 1924 and becoming part of the Scottish Senior Bar.
Career on the bench
In May 1934, Carmont was appointed a Senator of the College of Justice in succession to Lord Sands and took the Judicial Title of Lord Carmont. Lord Carmont remained as a Judge of the Outer House for only three years, after which record period of time he was appointed to the First Division.
In 1952, when razor gangs were running amok in Glasgow, Lord Carmont went there from Edinburgh to preside over the High Court and after warning that future sentences might require to be more severe if the use of razors and other similar weapons did not cease forthwith, he then imposed sentences of up to 10 years' imprisonment on all those who appeared before him convicted of inflicting horrific injuries on others. One week later the Glasgow police had their first weekend since the war without a single slashing or similar attack. This incident resulted in the phrase "Doing a Carmont" entering the language of the underworld and the press.
Later life and death
Lord Carmont continued to sit on the Court of Session until two weeks prior to his death at the age of 85.

The Fairy Pools () are a natural waterfall phenomenon in Glen Brittle on the Isle of Skye, on the Allt Coir' a' Mhadaidh (burn of the corrie of the wolf or dog). The pools are a vivid aqua blue and are a popular place for wild swimmers who brave the frigid waters.
The habitat of the Fairy Pools hosts a variety of animals, such as red deer, rabbits, and sheep. The area is also host to a large number of birds. Large flocks of crows, ravens, and gulls are present in the area, as well as such smaller birds as meadow pipits, turnstones, common ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins, and curlews. The physical landscape is predominantly rocky, with some boggy areas here and there. The water in the area is typically cold, as the pools are fed by mountain streams.
From being unnamed and virtually unrecognised as a tourist attraction, the Fairy Pools have become a soaringly popular location for walkers, with visitor numbers doubling between 2015 and 2019. It is about a 20-minute walk to the Fairy Pools from the Glen Brittle car park.
The location is in the site of the Battle of Coire Na Creiche.
Internet hoax
In 2013 an internet hoax circulated suggesting the Fairy Pools had sprouted vivid purple flora. The images circulated were actually of the Shotover River in New Zealand.

Mittelhufen was a suburban quarter of northwestern Königsberg, Germany. Its territory is now part of the Tsentralny District of Kaliningrad, Russia.
History
Mittelhufen was originally a village in the central part of the Hufen region extending north and west of the 17th century Baroque city walls. Many upper class estates developed in Mittelhufen during the 19th century. The estate Albrechtshöh was named after the Amtmann ("bailiff") Karl Albrecht in 1828; after Albrecht's death in 1840 the Villa Albrechtshöhe, later known as Luisenhöh, was separated from the estate. The estate Kohlhof was named after the justice commissioner Kohlhoff, while the estate Hardershof was documented in 1822 as Georg Harders Hof.
The villa suburb of Mittelhufen was incorporated into Königsberg on 1 April 1905. Neighboring quarters were Amalienau to the west, Hardershof to the north, Vorderhufen to the east, and Steindamm and Neurossgarten to the southeast.
Hufen-Park was located in northeastern Mittelhufen on both sides of the scenic Hufen-Freigrabenschlucht. This stream and gully proceeded from eastern Hufen-Park through the Luisenwahl, then turned south and entered the Pregel River at Kosse. Königsberg's zoo, the Tiergarten, opened in Hufen-Park in 1896. Located south of the zoo was the East Prussian open-air museum (1912-38) and the new Hufengymnasium (dedicated 1915). Along Hindenburgstraße was the Hufen-Oberlyzeum, a women's gymnasium.
The road Hansaring connected Hufenallee with Hansaplatz near Steindamm. Local institutions included the Neues Schauspielhaus, Oberpostdirektion (postal headquarters, now the Baltic Fleet headquarters), Prussian State Archive, and combined Amtsgericht and Landgerichte (now Kaliningrad State Technical University). Also nearby was the city's Polizeipräsidium (police headquarters, now used by the FSB).
The football club Königsberger STV played its home games at southern Mittelhufen's Walter-Simon-Platz (now Baltika Stadium), named after the philanthropist Walter Simon, who donated the land in 1892. In 1933 the field was renamed Erich-Koch-Platz, after the Nazi Gauleiter. The football club Rasensport-Preußen Königsberg was based out of Sportplatz Rasensport Preußen on Stresemannstraße (also known as Fuchsberger Allee and General-Litzmann-Straße) in the outskirts of northern Mittelhufen.

Whiting Williams (March 11, 1878 – April 14, 1975) was co-founder of the Welfare Federation of Cleveland, a predecessor to the Community Chest and United Way charitable organizations, as well as an author of popular books and articles about labor relations during the early 20th century. He was one of a number of social investigators who gathered information by going "undercover" to live as a worker.
Biography
Overview
Whiting Williams was born Charles Whiting Williams on March 11, 1878 in Shelby, Ohio to Benjamin J. Williams and Ida Whiting. He is best known as the management consultant who went undercover to study various working conditions in the early twentieth century. He disguised himself as a laborer in coal mines, railroad shops, shipyards, and oil refineries in the United States, Europe, and Central and South America. At the commencement of his research in 1920, he wrote a book, "What's on the Workers Mind, Put On Coveralls To Find Out", followed by several other writings which documented the findings of his research.
Education
In 1899, Whiting Williams graduated from Oberlin College after which he continued his education at the University of Berlin for a year (1899-1900), and then the University of Chicago (1900–01). Thereafter, he managed the Bureau of University Travel (1901–04), and became the Assistant to the President at Oberlin College (1904–12). In the meantime, he earned a master's degree in 1909.
Early career (1904-1918)
Williams career started when he took a position as manager of the University Travel Bureau. He held this job until 1904, when he wrote a letter to the President of Oberlin College, Henry C. King, during his trip to Europe. In this, he suggested that a college president needed a full-time assistant to look after the less academic problems facing a school. In November of that same year Williams received a reply to his letter in which he was appointed assistant to the President. He held this position until 1912, and within this time period he met and married his first wife, Caroline Harter.
In 1912, Williams moved to Cleveland, Ohio to co-found the Cleveland Federation for Charity and Philanthropy. This organization was based on the premise that the competition of charitable organizations with each other for contributions was detrimental to their best interests. In response to this, the Cleveland Federation proposed that a single organization conduct a single massive fund drive and disburse the contributions among the various charitable groups in the city. The Federation was groundbreaking in this attempt, and provided the foundation for what are known as Community Chest, United Fund, and United Way. In 1917, the organizations name changed to the Welfare Federation of Cleveland and Williams title became executive secretary within the Federation. He pioneered more than 2,400 United Appeals.
In 1916, Williams obtained a group promoting and selling group insurance as a special representative for the Equitable Life Assurance Society. A position as such was a novice concept at the time. Amidst the transitions he underwent in terms of his career, Williams grew concerned that his name was too popular, fearing that people might not be able to distinguish him among so many. Therefore, in June 1917 he had his name legally changed from Charles Williams to Whiting Williams.
In 1918, Williams moved to industrial world, to become Vice President and Personnel Director of Cleveland Hydraulic Pressed Steel Co.
Later career (1918-1960)
Williams took a leave of absence in 1920 to study working conditions and workers' attitudes firsthand, first in the United States, and later in various countries. Speaking multiple languages, French, German, Spanish, and Italian, enabled Williams to work as laborer in coal mines, railroad shops, shipyards, and oil refineries in the U.S., Europe, and Central and South America. Based on his research, he gave lectures and wrote several books such as; What's on the Worker's Mind (1920), Full Up and Fed Up (1921), Horny Hands and Hampered Elbows (1922), and Mainsprings of Men (1925).
Based on his work as a common laborer in the steel mills and in a rolling mill, as a coal miner in two towns, as a shipbuilder, as an oil man in a refinery, and as a worker in the iron mines, Williams wrote a 1920 book entitled "What's on the Worker's Mind, subtitled By One Who Put On Overalls To Find Out. Much of these experiences are presented in a journal-like format throughout the book.
In the preface, Williams argues that "the daily job as the axle of the entire world". The book is divided into two parts; part 1 "Overalls" and part 2 "Findings." In part 1, these topics are explored within the following chapters: "Hunting a Job", "In a Ten-Thousand-Man-Power Steel Plant", "In a Rolling-Mill", "Steel Slow-Miner's Wanted", "A Second Coal Town", "The Circle of the Hiring Gates", "With the Builders of Ships", "In an Oil Refinery", "In The Iron Mines", and "Among the Ignonts and Billets Again". The latter portion, "Findings," includes "Some Outstanding Impressions", "Some Deeper Factors", "The Way Out-and Management", and "The Way Out and The Public."
While conducting his research, Williams adopted the idea that "no half measures in the manner of disguise." Moreover, he presented himself with "a different name, a slim pocketbook, rough clothes, an unshaven face and a grammerless lingo". He claimed that his research "cheated no employer" as he worked tirelessly in order to derive the ruptured relations between "Labor, Management, and the Public -- the investors in brawn, brains, and bullion, and the bourgeoisie". Williams refrained from including any explicit details about companies within his book, including their geographic locations "because neither commendation nor criticism of communities or companies is intended or desired". Surprisingly, Williams did not offer conclusions or prescriptions but pointed out the most prominent concern among workers: terrible foremen.
Williams transformed his approach in 1931 from working for a single company or client to sending reports on labor conditions to a number of industrialists as a mass news service. These reports often considered the way in which management could placate industrial unrest and avoid other struggles within the workplace. Williams argued for an increased emphasis on individualism and consistently and vigorously opposed the New Deal and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in the following years. At the same time, he gained national fame as a respected lecturer. The groups he addressed varied in size from the local Rotary clubs to business conferences and graduate business schools.
Williams was a consultant on labor relations, personnel management, and public relations for several large businesses and spent the duration of his career lecturing about his experiences for several graduate schools including Harvard, Dartmouth, and Case Western Reserve University, until he retired at age 90. In 1940, he became a member of the National Panel of Arbitrators. In addition, he was a member of the Cosmos Club in Washington, D.C. as well as the Union Club of Cleveland. Meanwhile in Cleveland, he was a trustee of both Hiram House and the School of Art.
All the while, Williams continued writing articles. Williams continued working into the 1960s, the ninth decade of his life.
He was the subject of a biography by Daniel Wren in 1987. His collected papers are in the Western Reserve Historical Society.
Personal life
Williams married Caroline Harter in 1906. They had two children, Carol R. and Harter Whiting. Williams faced two major tragedies in his personal life. In 1932 his daughter Carol, who was a talented musician, was killed in a mysterious explosion in Cleveland Heights. Soon thereafter, in 1938 his wife, Caroline, died. Williams found strength in his son, Harter, and married Dorothy Rogers in September 1941. Williams was buried in Shelby, OH.

Mark Victor Rosenker (December 8, 1946 – September 26, 2020) was an American aviation official who served as the 11th Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) from August 2006 through August 2008. He was nominated by President George W. Bush and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Chairman Rosenker was renominated by President Bush for a second term as Chair and was going through the Senate confirmation process, which basically ended when President Obama was elected in November 2008.
He served as acting chair starting in March 2005 to August 2006 and then again from August 2008 until his resignation from the Board in August 2009, when he returned to private life. He died on September 26, 2020 from brain cancer at the age of 73.
Military service
Rosenker was a retired Air Force Reserve Major General. During his 37-year active duty and reserve career, Rosenker received numerous awards and decorations including the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal with One Oak Leaf Cluster and the Legion of Merit.
He was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in the USAF in June 1969 via the University of Maryland ROTC program. He began his active duty Air Force career in July 1969. He served five years as a civilian member of the Board of Visitors of the Community College of the Air Force. Rosenker graduated from the Air Command and Staff College and the Air War College.
Government work
Rosenker was appointed by the President a Board Member of the NTSB beginning March 2003 after unanimous confirmation by the United States Senate and was designated vice chairman the following month by the President. He began a second 5-year term as a Board Member in January 2005 after another unanimous confirmation. In October 2017 Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe appointed Rosenker to a 2-year term representing Virginia as a Commissioner of the new Washington Metrorail Safety Commission. He was elected Vice Chairman of the Commission on March 27, 2018.
From January 20, 2001, to November 2002 when President Bush nominated him for the NTSB, Rosenker served as deputy assistant to the President of the United States and Director of the White House Military Office. Rosenker was traveling with President George W. Bush on September 11, 2001.
Rosenker has served in the Department of the Interior, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as well as a brief assignment in the US Department of Transportation. Rosenker was appointed by President George H. W. Bush to serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission. During his career in civilian Federal service Mr. Rosenker received 8 Presidential appointments, three of which required Senate confirmation.
Piedmont Airlines Flight 22 investigation
As NTSB Chairman, Rosenker ordered the 2006/2007 re-opening of the controversial 1967 investigation of Piedmont Airlines Flight 22. In the official petition for reconsideration, Paul Houle (an amateur historian who asked for the investigation to be reopened) suggested that numerous important facts were missing from the original investigation, as well as apparent potential conflicts of interest that should have been found at the time. Despite the cockpit voice recorder conflicting with the original NTSB report, the NTSB's Office of Aviation Safety found no compelling reason to make any changes to the report. Rosenker subsequently wrote to Houle, sharing the Board's findings upholding the probable cause and contributing factors as presented in the original NTSB report.
Civilian work
Rosenker was Managing Director of the Washington, D.C. office for the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) from Oct 1999 to January 2001 when he joined the White House Staff. Prior to working for UNOS, Rosenker was the Vice President, Public Affairs for the Electronic Industries Alliance for 23 years.
In April 2012, Rosenker was appointed by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) to be a member of a special "Panel of Experts" to provide, advice, evaluation and assessment of potential new safety measures and best practices for improved cruise ship operations.
He was a member of the Board of Directors of the FLYHT Aerospace Corporation and Guest Services Inc. Rosenker was named to the Sequa Corporation Board of Directors (a Carlyle Group portfolio company) in August 2009 and stepped down from that Board in February 2016. He also served on the Board of Governors of the Aerospace Industries Association for several years.
Rosenker was the Transportation Safety Analyst for the CBS television and radio networks. Prior to that was a contributor to NBC News in the same role. Since retiring from the NTSB, he has appeared as a keynote speaker at numerous aviation and other transportation industry events. He has been a senior adviser to a number of industry sponsored coalitions advocating for safer roads.
Prior to his death, Rosenker was the president of the Transportation Safety Group LLC, a specialized consulting firm focused on transportation issues in the US and around the world.
He famously blamed the pilot and airlines safety standards in the Boeing 737 Max Lion Air crash and said “Certainly in the United States they understand how to operate this aircraft”

Oak Hill is a historic manor located at Jessup, Maryland, United States.
Oak Hill is a historic manor on a 235-acre farm between the Dorsey's Branch of the little Patuxent and the Old Annapolis road. The site is now dominated by the I-95 and Route 175 interchange, and the Port Capitol drive housing development, known as "Port Capital Village".
The manor houses were built and maintained by the Orson Adams (1835–1907) family. Adams was the president of the Commercial National Bank of New York, using Oak Hill as a summer home. A Victorian manor house and an English Manor house were built onsite and noted in 1876 Hopkins maps. For a period they operated as antique stores before being purchased by the Rouse Company for land development. Within ten years of ownership by Rouse, both historic structures were omitted from the historic register, and burned down. Oak Hill was one of many historical buildings in the region with valuable real estate that was developed after a fire set to the structure, including Ammendale Normal Institute (1998), Troy Hill (1990), Duvall Farm, Avondale Mill (1991), St. Mary's College (1997), and Henryton State Hospital (2007, 2011).
The Oak Hill youth detention complex in neighboring Anne Arundel County was named after the historic location.

The Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) was an influential cultural initiative, begun in London, England, in 1966 and active until about 1972, that focused on the works being produced by Caribbean writers, visual artists, poets, dramatists, filmmakers, actors and musicians. The key people involved in setting up CAM were Edward Kamau Brathwaite, John La Rose and Andrew Salkey. As Angela Cobbinah has written, "the movement had an enormous impact on Caribbean arts in Britain. In its intense five-year existence it set the dominant artistic trends, at the same time forging a bridge between West Indian migrants and those who came to be known as black Britons."
History
In 1968, Brathwaite wrote about CAM's origins, dating them back to a small informal meeting held on 19 December 1966 in his London flat in Mecklenburgh Square (although Louis James suggests that the "seed ideas of what was to become CAM were germinating in Brathwaite's activities at Mona in the previous decade"):
"What was to become the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) started in December 1966 in my Bloomsbury basement flat. I had recently arrived from the Caribbean on study leave to Britain, and as a writer myself, wanted, quite naturally, to get in touch with as many Caribbean artists as possible. But where were they? The novelists' books were being regularly published; at the Commonwealth Arts Festival I had seen work by a few painters, designers and sculptors from the Caribbean; but no one seemed to know how to get in touch with them. In addition it seemed to me that our West Indian artists were not participating significantly in the cultural life of the country that had become their home.
Since 1950, nearly every West Indian novelist worth the name had come to London and more than a hundred books had come from their typewriters and pens. But despite this, the British public didn't seem to be very much aware of the nature and value of this contribution.
...This situation, it seemed to me, was something to be deplored. The isolation of West Indian writers from each other and from the society in which they lived could eventually only stultify development and could do nothing to contribute to perhaps the most important problem of our times – the problem of the future of race relations in Britain."
The BBC programme Caribbean Voices, to which Brathwaite was also a contributor, is considered a precursor of CAM.
The journal Savacou was started as a platform for CAM, connecting its activities in Britain, the Caribbean region and the African diaspora, and elsewhere internationally. La Rose began selling and publishing books, under the name New Beacon Books, which addressed the demand for material that was stimulated by the formation of CAM.
Other notable artists and intellectuals associated with CAM include C. L. R. James, Stuart Hall, Wilson Harris, Kenneth Ramchand, Ronald Moody, Aubrey Williams, Gordon Rohlehr, Christopher Laird, Louis James, Clifton Campbell, Orlando Patterson, Ivan Van Sertima, Althea McNish, Donald Hinds, James Berry, Errol Lloyd and Anne Walmsley. Linton Kwesi Johnson is among a younger generation of Caribbean writers to have been inspired by CAM during the early 1970s. Walmsley has written a comprehensive appraisal of the movement in The Caribbean Artists Movement, 1966–1972: A Literary and Cultural History (1992), published by New Beacon Books.
CAM is acknowledged as being particularly significant in helping to "spark interest in the work of Britain's artists of color". The first CAM conference was held in 1967 in London, and a subsequent conference at the University of Kent in 1969. The work of CAM members was brought to the public eye by the BBC in the Caribbean edition of the magazine programme Full House, produced by John La Rose and transmitted on 3 February 1973, in which the work of writers, musicians and film-makers was presented in a studio setting of visual artists' work brought together by CAM member Althea McNish.

The Rabbi's Cat () is a 2011 French animated film directed by Joann Sfar and Antoine Delesvaux, based on volumes one, two and five of Sfar's comics series with the same title. It tells the story of a cat, who obtains the ability to speak after swallowing a parrot, and its owner who is a rabbi in the 1920s Algeria. The voice cast includes François Morel, Hafsia Herzi, Maurice Bénichou, Fellag, François Damiens and Jean-Pierre Kalfon.
Plot
The story takes place in the Jewish community of Algeria during the 1920s. One day a rabbi finds that his talking parrot, who is very noisy, has been eaten by his cat and that the cat has gained the ability to speak in human tongues. However, the rabbi finds that the cat is very rude and arrogant, so the rabbi teaches him about the Torah, with the cat deciding that — if he is Jewish — then he should receive a bar mitzvah, leading the two to consult with the rabbi's rabbi. The cat proceeds to mock and insult the rabbi's strict views, who declares that the cat should be killed for its heresy. The rabbi takes his cat and leaves, mad at the cat for making a fool of his master. The two eventually reach an agreement where the rabbi will teach the cat all about the Torah and that he might have his bar mitzvah when he is ready.
The cat helps the rabbi pass a French language exam so that he might one day become head rabbi, but after the exam the cat loses his ability to speak (as he invoked the name of God to pray for his master). After the discovery of a Russian Jew who has stowed away in a shipment of religious texts, the cat learns he can speak Russian. He eventually regains his ability to speak French, finding he knows many languages and can act as a translator. The Russian reveals that he is a painter who has fled from Soviet Russia. He has come to Africa to search for a hidden city of black Jews deep in the heart of Africa, and convinces the rabbi, his cat, and a former Russian soldier to help him in his search.

Production
Autochenille Production was launched in 2007 by Joann Sfar, Antoine Delesvaux and Clément Oubrerie with the aim to make "author-driven, challenging films to appeal to children and adults." The Rabbi's Cat was the company's first project. The production was made in collaboration with TF1 and France 3. It was pre-bought by Canal+ and CineCinéma and had a budget of 12.5 million euro. It is the second film directed by Sfar, after Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque).
One of the directors' sources of inspiration was American animation from the 1930s and, in particular, from the Fleischer Studios, which Sfar described as characterised by multi-ethnic production crews and for portraying dark aspects of society, in cartoons such as Betty Boop and Popeye. To generate more personality for the drawn characters in The Rabbi's Cat, some of the scenes were staged in a Parisian suburb loft in the summer of 2008, with props and the cast fully costumed. As the actors performed and invented their characters' personal motion habits, the design team observed closely and drew what they picked up.
The original soundtrack was composed by Olivier Daviaud, who had composed the music for Gainsbourg (Vie héroïque), and was performed by Enrico Macias and the Amsterdam Klezmer Band.
Release
The film was released in France on 1 June 2011 through UGC Distribution, which launched it in 243 prints. It competed at the 2011 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, where it won the top award: the Annecy Crystal for best feature.
Critical response
The Rabbi's Cat received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a rating of 94% based on 16 reviews and an average rating of 7.6/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 74 out of 100 based on nine reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews."
Pierre Vavasseur of Le Parisien gave a top rating of three stars and compared the impression it left to that of Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi. Vavasseur called The Rabbi's Cat "a pure pleasure" and complimented it for its variation and colourfulness, as well as for how it tackles the subject of a divided society: "Offsprings of Voltaire, Sfar and his cat don't stroke anyone with the hair, but throw as chefs together a broth of cultures with multiple flavours and with nurtured scenery."
Jacques Mandelbaum wrote a negative review in Le Monde, where he, among other things, criticised the film for having dull gags, lifeless voice acting and a dragging pace: "This general disconcertment is due to the lack of determination in the point of view, which evidently wants to take in everything and fails to grasp the bad. Between Chagall and The Adventures of Tintin, family chronicle and adventure film, biblical legend and colonial chronicle, historical reconstruction and winks to the contemporary world, the references are superimposed without achieving harmony. In the end, this plea for tolerance is a moral preaching so annoyingly gentle that it struggles to convince us of its legitimacy." Jordan Mintzer wrote in The Hollywood Reporter: "Though this gorgeously animated affair showcases the artist's freewheeling style and colorful arabesque imagery, its rambling episodic structure is not quite the cat's meow, even if it remains a thoroughly enjoyable take on Judaism in early 20th century North Africa. ... While the end result is somewhat chaotic, it proves that Sfar can make the jump from page to screen in ways that are both compelling and personal."
Awards and nominations
On 24 February 2012, The Rabbi's Cat (Le Chat du rabbin) was named Best Animated Film at the César Awards.
On 3 December 2012, it was announced that the film received two nominations at the 40th Annie Awards, including Best Animated Feature.
It won the Prix Jacques Prévert du Scénario for Best Adaptation in 2012.

Tai Po Market or Tai Po Hui is the name of an area within the modern-day Tai Po New Town in the Tai Po District, in the New Territories, Hong Kong. However, its exact location changed from time to time. It is considered as the town centre of the area known as Tai Po. The area was first established as a market town, at the location of the modern-day residential and commercial area Tai Po Old Market (or Tai Po Kau Hui), which is near the present-day area Tai Wo (Tai Wo Estate). Later on, a new market, Tai Wo Shi was established across the river and when the Kowloon-Canton Railway British Section was opened in 1910 it was the site of a flag station named Tai Po Market. However, all three areas do not overlap, and divided by Lam Tsuen River or Tai Po Tai Wo Road. Tai Po Market, Tai Po Old Market and Tai Wo Estate are all within modern day Tai Po New Town (Tai Po Town).
History
The first Tai Po Hui () was established by the Tang clan Tai Po Tau branch in the Qing dynasty. In Kangxi Year edition of Xin'an Xianzhi (Gazetteer of the Xin'an County (or San-On County in the Cantonese language)), the market town was also known as Tai Po Tau Hui (). In Jiaqing Year edition of the book, the place was known as Tai Po Hui (). The market town was located in the northern shore of the Lam Tsuen river mouth. However, non-Tang villages formed their own alliance , and established Tai Wo Shi (literally Tai Wo Market) in the south shore of the river. The alliance also built a bridge to connect the two market towns in 1896. Before the establishment of Tai Wo Shi, non-Tang villages were forbidden to establish shops in Tang's Tai Po Hui by the Qing government. It was said Tai Po Hui was one of the three major market towns of Hong Kong in the early Qing dynasty.
The area around the two Tai Po market towns, as well as other minor market towns, were leased to the British Empire in 1898. The region is now known as the New Territories. The colonial government built the Tai Po Market railway station next to the Tai Wo Shi in 1913. The District Office of the colonial Hong Kong government, also within the proximity of both new and old Tai Po Hui. In modern-day, the area around , the heart of the former Tai Wo Shi, was known as just Tai Po Hui, while the first market town of Tai Po (Tang's Tai Po Hui), was known as Tai Po Kau Hu (Tai Po Old Market) instead.
However, the usage of Tai Po Hui / Tai Po Market also extended to area that covered that modern-day electoral constituency Tai Po Hui, which included the 1960s built , (or known as the "Four Lanes of Tai Po Market": Kwong Fuk Lane, Tai Wing Lane, Tai Kwong Lane and Tai Ming Lane), as well as . The railway station, also moved to the current site, east of the former place in the 1980s.
To add more confusion to the name, government also opened an indoor wet market, the Tai Po Hui Market and Cooked Food Centre (), in in 2004, while its former location, was redeveloped into a public housing estate Po Heung Estate, where they are near to the Fu Shin Street. The two locations belong to the aforementioned Tai Po Hui constituency.
Tai Po Market (Tai Po Hui, formerly Tai Wo Shi)
Tai Wo Shi (Tai Wo Market), at modern day , was established in 1892. The market town was later known as Tai Po Hui (Tai Po Market). The street currently consisted of post-Qing dynasty buildings, except a well and a Man Mo Temple. The temple, at the heart of the Fu Shin Street, is a declared monument of Hong Kong. The former railway station of the market town, was converted into Hong Kong Railway Museum in the 1980s.
The market town Tai Wo Shi displaced the old Tai Po market town (Tang's Tai Po Hui) as the rural town centre of the area, which also took the ownership of the name Tai Po Hui (Tai Po Market). Some author credited the displacement was due to the accessibility of the new market. The New Territories circular road passes through Tai Wo Shi as Kwong Fuk Road, which connects to Tai Po Road in the south and in the north in the past, was constructed in the colonial area of the New Territories.
Tai Po was one of the market towns that was selected to be expanded into a satellite town (new town) in 1972.
Tai Po Old Market (Tai Po Kau Hui)
Tai Po Old Market (Tai Po Kau Hui), in Xin'an Xianzhi, was also listed as villages (as Tai Po Hui) along with Tai Po Tau. The former market town, which was established in 1672, was unable to observe in the modern day Tai Po Old Market. A Tin Hau Temple existed in the modern day Tai Po Old Market. The temple was established by the Tang clan Tai Po Tau branch before 1691. It was said an ancestral temple, the Temple of the Filial Son () was demolished in the 1970s.
Administration
Tai Po Hui and Tai Po Kau Hui are recognized villages under the New Territories Small House Policy.

The Terra di Otranto, or Terra d'Otranto (in English, Land of Otranto), is an historical and geographical region of Apulia, largely corresponding to the Salento peninsula, anciently part of the Kingdom of Sicily and later of the Kingdom of Naples, which became a province of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.
After the unification of Italy in the 1860s, most of the area was renamed as the Province of Lecce.
History
Since the eleventh century, have formed an integral part of the Terra d'Otranto the territories of today's provinces of Lecce, Taranto and Brindisi (with the exception of Fasano, Cisternino) and, until 1663, there had also included the territory of Matera.
Constituted executioner, the territory remained the administrative organization in the Kingdom of Sicily Kingdom of Naples and the next. Its capital was, at first, Otranto, but, during the Norman period (twelfth century), the city's canal was replaced by Lecce.
Geography
The Otranto was bounded on the north with the Terra di Bari, Basilicata to the west, with the Ionian Sea to the south and east by the Adriatic Sea.
It stretched for about 140 km from the so-called "threshold Messapian" located to the north, to Santa Maria di Leuca south, and on average for about 40 km between the Gulf of Taranto to the west and the Strait of Otranto in the east and then contained the whole Salento peninsula, but also a substantial part of the Murgia, known as the Valle d'Itria, and a part of the Alta Murgia declines towards the Ionian Sea.
By Act 132 of 1806 on the division and administration of the provinces of the Kingdom, launched on 8 August of that year, Joseph Bonaparte reformed the territorial division of the Kingdom of Naples on the basis of the French model, and abolished the system of justice. In the following years (between 1806 and 1811), a series of royal decrees completed the path for the establishment of the provinces with the specification of the municipalities covered in them and the definition of territorial boundaries and names of districts and districts in which it was divided each province.
From 1 January 1817 the administrative organization was finally regulated with the Law concerning the administrative district of the provinces of the Royal side of Faro Domains on 1 May 1816.
The seat of the administrative building was located in Lecce in the Celestine current seat of the prefecture.
Administrative Subdivision
The province was divided into the following hierarchical administrative levels from the previous employees. At the level immediately next to the province to identify the districts, in turn, were divided into districts. The districts were constituted by the municipalities, the basic unit of political and administrative structure of the modern state, which could head to the villages, a predominantly rural centers.
The province of Terra d'Otranto, therefore, included the following districts:
District of Lecce, established in 1806
District of Taranto, founded in 1806
District of Brindisi, established in 1806
District of Gallipoli, established in 1806
Each district was divided into districts for a total of 44
Suppression of the province
After the unification of Italy, the Terra d'Otranto was renamed the Province of Lecce. The four districts where his territory was divided into districts remained unchanged and became the Kingdom of Italy.
During the twentieth century, the historical territory of the province will be dismembered with the creation in 1923, the Province of the Ionian and in 1927, the Province of Brindisi (which were common two aggregates, Fasano, Cisternino, formerly belonging to Bari).
Arms
The coat of arms depicts a dolphin darting in the mouth that has the crescent symbol of the Turks.
The crescent was inserted after the expulsion of Muslims at the hands of Alfonso of Aragon, son of King Ferdinand I of Naples took place in 1481, a year after the fall into enemy hands.
Cuisine
its name is also the name of a PDO extra-virgin olive oil called Terra d'Otranto.

The coat of arms of Kurów and the Kurów municipality consists of a white cock with a gold crest, bill, talons and in its beak a white handkerchief in a red field.
History
The first coat of arms of Kurów (from January 6, 1442) depicted the cock without the handkerchief (probably because the Polish surname Kurowski who was the owner of Kurów comes from the word kur, meaning "cock"). In 1464 the handkerchief was added to the coat of arms from the arms of the Zbąski family, who were the owners of Kurów from 1464 to 1683.

Thomas Houston Watson (4 October 1900 – 13 May 1978) was an Irish professional footballer. He began his career with Irish Intermediate League side Crusaders as a half back before joining Cardiff City in 1925 where he converted to defence. He became a regular first team player during his debut season in the Football League and later played in the 1927 FA Cup Final, helping the side become the only team from outside England to win the competition.
He made more than 100 appearances for Cardiff in all competitions until a cartilage injury cost him his place in the side. He returned to Ireland with Linfield, winning a league and cup double in his first season. He later returned to play for Crusaders before managing amateur side Whiteabbey, where he won the Irish Football Alliance in his first season. He later became a referee. Watson also won a single cap for Ireland, in a match against Scotland in 1926, and played for representative sides of both the Irish Intermediate League and Welsh League during his career.
Early life
Watson was born in Belfast on 4 October 1900 to Janet and William James Watson. His father worked as a caulker.
Club career
Early years
Watson began his football career as a youth player with Glenarm before joining Irish Intermediate League side Crusaders. His performances for the side led to him being selected to represent an Intermediate League XI in matches against their counterparts from other leagues, including captaining the side against a Yorkshire League XI in February 1925. Crusaders had previously sold Jimmy Nelson, a childhood friend of Watson, to Cardiff City in 1921 where the Scotsman had impressed. Cardiff subsequently approached Crusaders to enquire "Have you any more players like Jimmy?". This correspondence ultimately led to Watson and Tom Sloan joining Cardiff.
Cardiff City
Watson signed for the Welsh side in August 1925 on a free transfer. During his time with Crusaders, he had played as a half back but on arrival at Cardiff, the club's coaching staff believed he would be more suited to a defensive role. He was trialled in the new position for several reserve matches and impressed the club enough for the change to be made permanent.
He began the 1925–26 season as cover for club captain Jimmy Blair from the side. He made his debut for the club in a 1–0 victory over West Ham United on 7 September 1925 in place of Blair. Starting alongside Nelson, the Belfast Telegraph noted that the pair were "sorely tried". His second appearance came more than a month later in a 5–0 defeat to Arsenal again in place of the injured Blair. Despite the heavy defeat, Watson earned praise in match reports and maintained his place in the side. Despite only appearing in one further match, Watson was selected for a Welsh League XI to play their counterparts from the Irish League in Swansea on 31 October. He missed only three further games during the remainder of the campaign for Cardiff, making a total of 33 appearances in all competitions during the year as he formed a defensive partnership with Nelson. His form led the club to transfer list Blair in the first half of the season before selling him towards the end of the year.
In his second season with Cardiff, Watson made a further 45 appearances in all competitions, including playing in all seven matches of their successful FA Cup run. Ahead of the final, Watson was described as "one of the best tacklers playing this season" in the Daily Herald. The newspaper also noted that his partnership with Nelson formed one of the "best pairs of backs in the country." Cardiff defeated Arsenal 1–0 to become the only team from outside England to win the competition. He remained prominent during the first half of the 1927–28 season, missing only 2 of the first 20 league matches of the campaign. However, from late December, his season was blighted by injuries; he made only two appearances in the second half of the campaign, the second in a heavy 7–1 defeat against Derby County on 31 March 1928. He underwent knee surgery in October 1928 in attempt to rectify his cartilage injury problems, having not made an appearance during the new season. As such, he appeared only once during the 1928–29 campaign, returning in a 3–1 defeat to Manchester City in the final month of the campaign.
His injury problems and the form of his replacement William Roberts led to his departure from the club as he was unable to regain his place. At the end of the season Watson was placed on the transfer list, along with Sloan. Watson received interest from Fulham and Derry City who both made approaches, with Cardiff seeking around £500 for the transfer. However, Watson was instead transferred to Linfield along with Sloan.
Return to Ireland
In his first year with Linfield, he helped the side to a double by winning both the Irish League and Irish Cup. In the final of the cup, on 29 March 1930, Linfield secured a 4–3 victory over Ballymena United. Watson was involved in a clash of heads with Ballymena player Kilpatrick with the score tied at 3–3 which left the opposition player unable to continue. The Belfast News Letter reported that the incident had likely turned the game in Linfield's favour, writing "Had that accident not happened, Ballymena would, in all probability, have got the winning goal."
The Irish Cup victory completed an unusual treble of winning the major cup competition in three countries after already having won the FA Cup and the Welsh Cup. He remained with Linfield until August 1932 when he returned to his first club Crusaders.
International career
Watson represented Ireland at youth level before receiving his first call-up to the senior side in February 1926, following a number of withdrawals due to injury, for a match against Scotland. Ireland lost the match 4–0.
Later life
After retiring from playing, Watson managed amateur side Whiteabbey and also served on the club's committee. In his first season in charge, he led the club to the Irish Football Alliance title. His success saw him named on a three-man shortlist for the vacant managerial role at Bangor. He later became a referee in the Irish Junior League, officiating his first match in September 1938. Watson married his partner Daisy and the couple had four children. He died at his home in Newtownabbey in May 1978 at the age of 77.

Posttraumatic Embitterment Disorder (PTED) is defined as a pathological reaction to a negative life event, which those affected experienced as a grave insult, humiliation, betrayal, or injustice. Prevalent emotions of PTED are embitterment, anger, fury, and hatred, especially against the triggering stressor, often accompanied by fantasies of revenge. The disorder commences immediately and without time delay at the moment of the triggering event. If left untreated, the prognosis of PTED presents as rather unfavorable, since patients find themselves trapped in a vicious circle of strong negative emotions constantly intensifying one another and eventually leading into a self-destructive downward spiral. People affected by PTED are more likely to put fantasies of revenge into action, making them a serious threat to the stressor.
The concept of PTED as a distinct clinical disorder has been first described by the German psychiatrist and psychologist Michael Linden in 2003, who remains its most involved researcher. Even though it has been backed up by empirical research in the past years, it remains disputed as to whether embitterment should be included among psychological disorders. Therefore, PTED currently does not hold its own category in the ICD-10 but is categorized under F43.8 “Other reactions to severe stress”. It cannot be categorized as an adjustment disorder under F43.2, since “ordinary” adjustment disorders normally subside within six months, while PTED is much more likely to become chronical and last for much longer. A condition similar to PTED has already been described by Emil Kraepelin as early as 1915 by the name querulous paranoia as a form of traumatic neuroses, explicitly demarcating it from personality disorders.
Bitterness and Embitterment
Bitterness (also called resentment) is defined as a basic human reaction in response to experiences of injustice, betrayal, or humiliation, consisting of emotions such as anger, wrath, hostility, disappointment, disgust, and shame. However, while “ordinary” bitterness is just a transient emotion, which will eventually fade away, embitterment is described as a much more prolonged state of bitterness, which will not easily subside and can severely impair the quality of life of those affected and of their environment. Typically, embitterment will flare uptime and time again upon recalling the triggering incident.
Prevelance
Preliminary data suggest a prevalence of about 2–3% in the general population. Increased prevalence rates are observed when larger groups of people are subject to social upheaval. Accordingly, Linden described this condition for the first time after the German reunification.
Causes
Severe reactions of embitterment can be triggered if someone's core beliefs are being heavily violated. In psychology, core beliefs are defined as mindsets, opinions, and values, which define an individual. They function as a cognitive reference system which structures the perception of the world, of oneself, of others, of what is important or not, what is right or wrong, and what is necessary to be done, and can involve both negative and positive feelings. They are of great individual and social importance and can be handed down transgenerationally, thereby shaping entire cultures. Core beliefs are not necessarily true in view of reality, but they feel true to an individual, no matter what they consist of. Therefore, information contradicting them is commonly ignored, making them difficult to change or challenge.
Since core beliefs are a central aspect of an individual's identity, they are especially vulnerable to insults, humiliations, betrayal, and injustice, which are psychologically perceived as aggressions. PTED can be triggered if a violation of a core belief, especially a positive one, is too severe to be ignored and to be properly processed, and if there is no way for those affected to fight back and defend their beliefs, leaving them in a state of helplessness, resignation and eventually embitterment. As core beliefs are unique for every individual, what might seem like a triviality or just a minor nuisance to one person, can cause an existential crisis in another one, especially if they lack the psychological resilience to overcome the crisis.
Symptoms and diagnostic criteria
A. Essential criteria:
clinically significant emotional symptoms or behavioral problems, starting immediately after exactly one singular negative, stressful life event, which – from the outside – appears to be no more than an everyday occurrence (i. e. nothing out of the ordinary like road accidents, robberies, or war)
patient is aware of the triggering event and has identified it as the cause of the disorder
triggering event is experienced as unjust, humiliating and/or insulting
recurring intrusive thoughts of the triggering event
patients reacts with emotional arousal upon recalling the triggering event
B. Additional symptoms:
dysphoric-aggressive-depressive mood; mood appears similar to Major depressive disorder with Somatic symptom disorder
unimpaired affect regulation when distracted
Avolition
patient sees himself as victim
patient sees himself as helpless and unable to overcome the triggering event or its cause
self-blame for not having prevented the triggering event or for being unable to cope with it
indifference in view of own health
unspecific somatic symptoms (e. g. insomnia, loss of appetite, pain)
phobic avoidance of persons or places related to the triggering event
weariness of life and suicidal ideation
recurring fantasies of revenge and aggressive thoughts towards the stressor, sometimes including fantasies of murder or murder-suicide
querulous persistence in the fight for the restoration of justice
C. no signs of a psychological disorder in the year prior to the triggering event, which could explain the abnormal reaction; no recrudescence into previous psychological disorder
D. clinically significant impairment or strain on own condition, and social, occupational, or other important spheres of life
E. symptoms have been persisting for at least six months since the moment of the triggering event
PTED does not present as “traumatic” in view of its preceding trigger, but because of its chronological course of events: Minutes prior to the triggering event, those affected were perfectly healthy, minutes later they are ill and severely impaired. In this regard PTED resembles PTSD. However, the nature of the triggering event in PTED has little influence on the nature of the ensuing symptoms.
PTED will not subside on its own but rather intensify over time, leading patients into a self-destructive downward spiral of negative emotions constantly reinforcing one another. If left untreated, PTED is very likely to eventually lead those affected into implementing their aggressions towards the stressor, thereby committing the most serious felonies.
Diagnosis
BEI
The Berner Embitterment-Inventory (BEI) (Znoj, 2008; 2011) measures emotional embitterment, performance-related embitterment, pessimism/hopelessness, and misanthropy/aggression.
PTED scale
The PTED scale is a 19 item self-rating questionnaire and can be used to identify reactive embitterment and assess the severity of PTED. Answers are given on a five-point Likert scale. An average score of 2.5 identifies with a clinically relevant degree of embitterment response, though it does not officially confirm a diagnosis. Higher values are only indications of critical embitterment. The diagnosis of PTED is only possible through a detailed clinical assessment or standardized diagnostic interview.
Standardized diagnostic interview
The standardized diagnostic interview of PTED asks for core criteria of PTED. In the diagnostic interview, it must be clarified what the patient means when they describe their experiences and feelings.
Differential Diagnoses
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):
triggered by one singular or several potentially life-threatening, uncommon events causing extreme fear and panic (e. g. road accidents, robberies, war)
cardinal emotion is recurring or persisting fear; embitterment does not occur
Major depressive disorder:
very common misdiagnosis due to several symptomatic similarities (e. g. depressed mood, avolition, suicidality, absent-mindedness)
contrary to PTED no direct temporal connection to debilitating events, no singular stressor
no anhedonia in PTED patients
Adjustment disorder:
normally subsides within six months after the triggering event
can be caused by a number of events, not necessarily by insults, betrayal, humiliation or injustice
Phobia:
Avoidance behavior caused by fear, not by embitterment
Personality disorders:
Lifelong development, no immediate connection to a singular event
PTED completely reversible by therapy, effects of PDs only mitigable
However: development of PTED might be facilitated by existing PDs
Paranoia, Delusions, Schizotypal disorder, Schizophrenia, Querulant delusion, Moral injury
Psychotherapy
The treatment of posttraumatic bitterness is complicated by the typical resignative-aggressive-defensive attitude of the patient, which is also directed against therapeutic offers. One approach of treatment is wisdom therapy developed by Linden, a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy that aims to empower the patient to distance themselves from the critical life event and build up new life perspectives.
One uses the usual cognitive strategies of attitude change and problem-solving are used, such as:
behavior therapeutic methods like behavioral analysis and cognitive rehearsal
analysis of automatic thoughts and schemata
reframing or cognitive reattribution
exposure treatments
increase of activities
rebuilding of social contacts
promotion of self-effectiveness
A special treatment module aims at the training of wisdom competencies, which means promoting the following abilities:
changing perspectives
empathy
perception and acceptance of emotions
emotional balance and sense of humour
contextualism
long-term orientation
value relativism
tolerance of uncertainty
self-distance and self-relativization
Methodically, the method of "insolvable problems" is used. In this procedure, fictitious serious and insolvable conflict situations are presented, which allow the patients to train wisdom capacities and transfer them to their own situation (so-called "learning transfer.")
Criticism
The problem of embitterment reactions and also the posttraumatic embitterment disorder increasingly gain international attention.
Nevertheless, there are some unsolved problems. Further research is needed to differentiate between PTED and other mental disorders. In 2014 science journalist Jörg Blech mentioned this disorder in his book Die Psychofalle - Wie die Seelenindustrie uns zu Patienten macht ("The Psycho Trap: How the Soul Industry Makes Us Patients"). It is discussed whether the introduction of PTED may make a problem out of everyday problems. However, according to the available studies, the primary problem is not the differentiation between healthy and ill persons, since patients with PTED have regularly been given a variety of diagnoses. It is about the differential diagnostic differentiation of a special type of disorder, as a precondition for a goal-oriented therapy.

The Oven of Akhnai is a Talmudic story found in Bava Metzia 59a-b which is set around the early 2nd century CE. In the Talmud, the story is told after a discussion of being careful not to mistreat a person and the power of prayers which are said in pain to be heard by God. The story concerns a debate which was held over the halakhic status of a new type of oven. In the course of the rabbinic disagreement, the story expresses differing views of the nature of law and authority, concerns over a fractured and divisive community, and the issue of harming another person through words and actions.
Story
A new type of oven is brought before the Sanhedrin, consisting of tiles separated from one another by sand, but externally plastered over with cement. The rabbis debate whether or not this oven is susceptible to ritual impurity. Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus argues that the oven is ritually pure while the other rabbis, including the nasi Rabban Gamaliel, argue that the oven is impure. When none of Rabbi Eliezer's arguments convince his colleagues, he cries out, "If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, this carob tree will prove it." At this point, the carob tree leaps from the ground and moves far away. The other rabbis explain that a carob tree offers no proof in a debate over law. Rabbi Eliezer cries out, "If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, the stream will prove it." The stream begins to flow backwards, but again the other rabbis point out that one does not cite a stream as proof in matters of law. Rabbi Eliezer cries out, "If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, the walls of the study hall will prove it." The walls of the study hall begin to fall, but are then scolded by Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah who reprimands the walls for interfering in a debate among scholars. Out of respect for Rabbi Joshua, they do not continue to fall, but out of respect for Rabbi Eliezer, they do not return to their original places.
In frustration, Rabbi Eliezer finally cries out, "If the halakha is in accordance with my opinion, Heaven will prove it." From Heaven a voice is heard, saying, "Why are you differing with Rabbi Eliezer, as the halakha is in accordance with his opinion in every place that he expresses an opinion?" Rabbi Joshua responds, "It [the Torah] is not in heaven" (Deuteronomy 30:12). He responds in this way because the Torah, which was given by God to mankind at Sinai, specifically instructs those who follow it that they are to look to the received Torah as their source and guide. The Torah says, "It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?' No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe" (Deuteronomy 30:12-14).
Rabbi Joshua's response then expresses the view that the work of law is a work of human activity, and that the Torah itself supports this legal theory. The Torah is not a document of mystery which must have its innate meaning revealed by a minority, but it is instead a document from which law must be created through the human activity of debate and consensus. Rabbinic literature was capable of recognizing differing opinions as having a degree of legitimacy (Yer. Ber. 3b), yet the community remains united and the ruling which is ultimately followed comes through proper jurisprudence. As such, Rabbi Eliezer's miraculous appeals represent a differing legal theory and were outside of proper jurisprudence which meant that they would not be followed. Instead the Jewish community followed the ruling of the majority in this issue and in others. The Talmud asks how God responded to this incident. We are told that upon hearing Rabbi Joshua's response, God smiled and stated, "My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me."
After this incident, the rabbis under Rabban Gamaliel choose to ostracize Rabbi Eliezer from their community. Rabbi Akiva, a student of Rabbi Eliezer, volunteers to bring this news to Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva dresses himself in clothes of mourning, and he delicately says to Rabbi Eliezer, "My teacher, it appears to me that your colleagues are distancing themselves from you." Rabbi Eliezer tears his clothes in mourning and begins to cry. It was said that Rabbi Eliezer had the power to destroy the whole world, yet due to the respectful manner in which he was ostracized, only a third of the world's crops were destroyed.
When Rabbi Eliezer was given the news of being ostracized, Rabban Gamaliel was on a boat. A great storm picked up, and Rabban Gamaliel knew that this storm was retribution for the pain caused to Rabbi Eliezer. Rabban Gamaliel proclaims to God, "Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before You that neither was it for my honor that I acted when ostracizing him, nor was it for the honor of the house of my father that I acted; rather, it was for Your honor, so that disputes will not proliferate in Israel." When he spoke these words, the storm was calmed.
Rabbi Eliezer continued to be in grief over being ostracized from the community. His wife, Ima Shalom (the sister of Rabban Gamaliel), was aware of the power that a prayer said in pain had to be heard. She attempted to interfere with her husband's supplication prayers so that any calls for retribution or bemoaning of his fate would not be heard. Yet one day she was distracted and failed to interfere with Rabbi Eliezer's prayers. At this moment, Rabban Gamaliel died. Rabbi Eliezer asked his wife how she knew that this would happen if he were to pray while in such pain. Ima Shalom explains the sentiment expressed in the discussion preceding the story of the Oven of Akhnai, she says, "This is the tradition that I received from the house of the father of my father: All the gates of Heaven are apt to be locked, except for the gates of prayer for victims of verbal mistreatment."
Interpretations
There are many different themes in the story of the Oven of Akhnai. In the backdrop of the story is the status of Judaism prior to Rabban Gamaliel and the views that developed among the late Pharisaic or early Rabbinic Jews. During the Second Temple period there existed numerous forms of Judaism. Jewish factions during the Second Temple period harshly denounced one another and sometimes were violent towards each other. Following the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, the Rabbis pondered why the destruction occurred. The Rabbis concluded that the Second Temple was destroyed due to "baseless hate" (Yoma 9b). In their retelling of the destruction, they point to divisions and a lack of empathy for one another.
The Rabbis under Rabban Gamaliel sought to unify Judaism and end wanton sectarianism. Rabban Gamaliel's school recognized a degree of validity in varying statements, but chose to follow the more lenient philosophy of the school of Hillel. Jewish leaders like Rabban Gamaliel sought to create a cohesive Jewish community where major issues were settled, a system was in place to decide divisive issues, and minor issues could be tolerated. Rejection of this cooperation and an embrace of sectarianism was condemned in the strongest terms. Rabban Gamaliel himself was known to at times be too forceful in humiliating those who formed divisions.
According to Vered Noam, Rabbi Eliezer sought to reveal an innate halakhah based on revelation and he did not accept proper jurisprudence. In contrast, Rabban Gamaliel and the other rabbis sought to create halakhah through human reason and utilizing proper jurisprudence. Rabbi Eliezer expresses a differing philosophy regarding halakhah and a rejection of following the jurisprudence upon which a cohesive community relies. The dispute is not simply over an oven, but this is a story which reflects two conflicting ideas over the nature of law and possibilities for destabilizing of the community. Rabbi Gamaliel expresses his concerns when calming the storm, stating that the reason for his heavy-handed action was "so that disputes will not proliferate in Israel," the very same disputes which resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE.
At the same time, the story is introduced solely on the basis of a discussion of being careful not to hurt another individual through verbal interactions. Rabban Gamaliel may have had the correct intentions and his philosophies which were necessary for sustaining his community may have won out, yet he still hurt his colleagues through his words and decisions. While much focus is placed on the accuracy of Rabban Gamaliel's position or Rabbi Joshua's statement, the story in the Talmud does not overlook the fact that Rabban Gamaliel's draconian measures may have gone too far.
Scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein has argued that the Oven of Akhnai focuses on the fact that the majority need to take charge over the minority, but in a way that it is fair to all. The majority needs to work off the minority to attend the needs of everyone in the community. Yet, explains Rubenstein, the midrash says there is a limit to what the majority can do. People should not aim to cause someone to experience pain, but instead respect one another.
Geological interpretation
Geoarchaeologist Beverly Goodman and historian Henry Abramson theorize that the events mentioned in the story are a mythologized version of the effects of a tsunami in the area in 115 CE.
Influence
The Oven of Akhnai is one of the best known stories in the Talmud. As a result of the story, the phrase, "Lo Bashamayim Hi," or, "Not in Heaven," is well known among Jews. The phrase and story helps to reflect the Jewish view of law, the feasibility of following the Torah, and the importance of every generation to work to understand the Torah.
The story of the Oven of Akhnai is also notable in being one of the stories where a woman is mentioned having learned Torah and expressing her understandings.

Maria Perrotta is an Italian classical pianist and a Decca Records artist.
Life and career
Born in Cosenza in 1974, Maria Perrotta made her debut with a symphony orchestra at the age of 11, performing Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1, but she came to the limelight in 2012, after performing J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations during her ninth month of pregnancy. An ambulance was stationed outside the theatre in case the artist went into labour during the recital. Very few women in history had given a concert this far into their pregnancy; one of them being Clara Schumann.
The live performance, published on CD by Decca, received rave reviews: "A perfect blend of the lush pianism of Alexis Weissenberg and the laser-like focus of Glenn Gould".
In 2013 Decca released a CD of Beethoven's Piano Sonatas Opp. 109, 110 and 111 played live by Maria Perrotta. The recording was acclaimed in leading musical magazines, including Gramophone, and in major newspapers: "Where Pollini is fast and formalistic, Perrotta is analytical and expressive, but, like Pollini, always maintains a sense of formal unity.".
A graduate of the Milan Conservatoire, the École Normale de Musique in Paris and the National Academy of St Cecilia in Rome, she has won top prizes in several international competitions, including the Shura Cherkassky International Piano Competition in Milan and the triennial International J.S. Bach Piano Competition in Germany. She has broadcast on Sky TV and on German and Italian radio.
Maria Perrotta is married to the Italian baritone Lucio Prete, with whom she has two daughters. They live in Paris.

RocketMQ is a distributed messaging and streaming platform with low latency, high performance and reliability, trillion-level capacity and flexible scalability. It is the third generation distributed messaging middleware open sourced by Alibaba in 2012. On November 21, 2016, Alibaba donated RocketMQ to the Apache Software Foundation. Next year, on February 20, the Apache Software Foundation announced Apache RocketMQ as a Top-Level Project.
History
The development of RocketMQ can be divided into three stages.
The first generation uses the push mode in data transportation, and relational database in data storage. It shows low latency in message delivery and meets the command of a typical E-commerce platform with distributed transactions.
The second generation uses the pull mode in data transportation, and file system in data storage. It paid more attention to stability and reliability, and shows a comparable performance to the first generation in response time and Kafka on log collection.
The third generation combines the Pull mode with some Push operations. It inherits the advantages of the first and second generation, and shows high performance in concurrency and massive amounts of data scenarios.
Features
Much comparison have been made between the various messaging solutions, and it is widely known that when the number of topics increases dramatically, the throughput of RocketMQ dropped much less than Kafka. Because the characteristics of high performance, high reliability and high real-time ability, more and more efforts have been made to the combination of RocketMQ and other protocol components in every type of messaging scenarios such as MQTT.
Architecture
RocketMQ consists of four parts: name servers, brokers, producers and consumers. Each of them can be horizontally extended without a single point of Failure. As shown in image left.
NameServer Cluster
The lightweight component for service discovery and they can be used to read and write routing information. Each one records global information, and supports fast storage expansion.
Broker Cluster
They use lightweight TOPIC and QUEUE mechanisms to manage data storage. To realize fault tolerance, two copies or three copies of data are provided. And Client can get message in Push and Pull model. In addition, disaster recovery and rich metrics statistics are also supported.
Producer Cluster
Producers can be distributed deployed, and messages from producers to brokers can be balanced through multi-path. In addition, fast failure and low latency are supported.
Consumer Cluster
Consumers can also be distributed deployed in the push and pull model, and they can subscribe message real-time, consume message in the unit of cluster. Message broadcasting is also supported.
Applications
There are at least five aspects Apache RocketMQ could relate to:
The integration of heterogeneous systems；
Decoupling between applications;
Backbone in the event-driven mechanism and complex event architecture model;
Data replication channels;
Integration with flow calculation engine;
Stream data access.
Community Maintenance
The RocketMQ team have done much to active the community. Meetups, Workshops, ApacheCon and Code Marathon are regular held in BeiJing, ShenZhen, HangZhou to attract new contributors and committers. The OpenMessaging benchmarking suites are currently available for the RocketMQ and it makes RocketMQ keep the pace with the global standard for distributed messaging. As for version management, a series of standardized software development processes are adopted. The latest version is 4.2.0, and 4.3.0 is on the way. More information can be reached in here.

Webster A. Young is a composer of symphonies, ballets and operas. He was the most prolific composer for ballet in the US in the 1980s, before Martins-Torke, working with Eric Hyrst, formerly of the Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, New York City Ballet, and the Royal Ballet of England. Young appears with Eric Hyrst in the film "Two for Ballet", available from Cinema Guild, NY. "Two for Ballet" was seen on 63 PBS stations nationwide in 1992. The Jerome Robbins Dance Collection at Lincoln Center, NY, has an extensive file on Eric Hyrst's career that also includes videos of the first three Hyrst-Young ballets. Young became the artistic director of the Long Island Opera Company 1998–2003. Young was the first composer in many decades to set Shakespeare's "As You Like It" to music as an opera in four acts. Soprano, tenor, and baritone operas from it are published at MusicNotes.com, and several performances are in videos at YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Youku, and Toudou.com Now on his Opus 198. Among his most recent works are several pieces for unaccompanied cello. Other recent works include 20 tangos and 10 salsa pieces for orchestra, some also arranged for piano. Opera arias and piano music published at MusicNotes.com Young studied composition with Richard Swift, Andrew Frank, Giampaolo Bracali, and notably with Charles Jones - who was acquainted with Stravinsky and a close friend of Darius Milhaud. Young is related through his grandmother, Seena Harbach Purdy, to Otto Harbach, the Broadway lyricist and playwright, who was his great uncle. Otto Harbach's oldest brother, Adolphe, Webster Young's great grandfather, was a band conductor. Young's paternal grandfather, Owen Young, was a semi professional watercolor landscape painter, of whose works a few hundred paintings are extant. Webster Young is the author of three books: The Palaces of Music (2017), Music, Painting and Jung (2012), and The Little Flowers of the Desert Brothers (2017), all published at Amazon.com under his name.

Lallemantia oil is a seed oil, extracted from the seeds of the Lallemantia iberica. It contains 68% linolenic acid, making it an unusually rich source, and of potential commercial interest. Lallemantia oil has been discovered at a number of archeological sites in northern Greece, dating from the Bronze Age. As the plant is not native to this region, the presence of this oil suggests that it was imported from further east.
Uses
Lallemantia oil is a drying oil, and can be used as a substitute for linseed oil in this and other contexts. The oil is also edible.

In theoretical physics, a mass generation mechanism is a theory that describes the origin of mass from the most fundamental laws of physics. Physicists have proposed a number of models that advocate different views of the origin of mass. The problem is complicated because the primary role of mass is to mediate gravitational interaction between bodies, and no theory of gravitational interaction reconciles with the currently popular Standard Model of particle physics.
There are two types of mass generation models: gravity-free models and models that involve gravity.
Background
Electroweak theory and the Standard Model
The Higgs mechanism is based on a symmetry-breaking scalar field potential, such as the quartic. The Standard Model uses this mechanism as part of the Glashow–Weinberg–Salam model to unify electromagnetic and weak interactions. This model was one of several that predicted the existence of the scalar Higgs boson.
Gravity-free models
In these theories, as in the Standard Model itself, the gravitational interaction either is not involved or does not play a crucial role.
Technicolor
Technicolor models break electroweak symmetry through gauge interactions, which were originally modeled on quantum chromodynamics.
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism
Coleman–Weinberg mechanism generates mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking through radiative corrections.
Other theories
Unparticle physics and the unhiggs models posit that the Higgs sector and Higgs boson are scaling invariant, also known as unparticle physics.
UV-Completion by Classicalization, in which the unitarization of the WW scattering happens by creation of classical configurations.
Symmetry breaking driven by non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum fields above the electroweak scale.
Asymptotically safe weak interactions based on some nonlinear sigma models.
Models of composite W and Z vector bosons.
Top quark condensate.
Gravitational models
Extra-dimensional Higgsless models use the fifth component of the gauge fields in place of the Higgs fields. It is possible to produce electroweak symmetry breaking by imposing certain boundary conditions on the extra dimensional fields, increasing the unitarity breakdown scale up to the energy scale of the extra dimension. Through the AdS/QCD correspondence this model can be related to technicolor models and to UnHiggs models, in which the Higgs field is of unparticle nature.
Unitary Weyl gauge. If one adds a suitable gravitational term to the standard model action with gravitational coupling, the theory becomes locally scale-invariant (i.e. Weyl-invariant) in the unitary gauge for the local SU(2). Weyl transformations act multiplicatively on the Higgs field, so one can fix the Weyl gauge by requiring that the Higgs scalar be a constant.
Preon and models inspired by preons such as the Ribbon model of Standard Model particles by Sundance Bilson-Thompson, based in braid theory and compatible with loop quantum gravity and similar theories. This model not only explains the origin of mass, but also interprets electric charge as a topological quantity (twists carried on the individual ribbons), and colour charge as modes of twisting.
In the theory of superfluid vacuum, masses of elementary particles arise from interaction with a physical vacuum, similarly to the gap generation mechanism in superfluids. The low-energy limit of this theory suggests an effective potential for the Higgs sector that is different from the Standard Model's, yet it yields the mass generation. Under certain conditions, this potential gives rise to an elementary particle with a role and characteristics similar to the Higgs boson.

Carmen Celia Beltrán (February 19, 1905 – May 26, 2002) was a Mexican-American writer of poetry, plays, essays, and radio and religious dramas.
Early life
Beltrán was born in Durango, Mexico on February 19, one of seven children in her family. The Beltrán's were a family of musicians. Her mother, Guadalupe, played mandolin, all of her siblings played instruments, and her father a Major in the military band of Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. The dangers of the Mexican Revolution, combined with her father's political connections, forced the family to flee into the mountains of Durango. Beltrán would be hidden with Carmelite nuns until she was old enough to travel with the family to the United States. During the family's attempts to get to the United States, they were victims in the midst of a train heist, which left them stranded with no money or baggage in San Pedro de las Colonias.
The family arrived in San Antonio, Texas after traveling for two years. Her father started a music studio and taught band classes, inspiring his daughter. Beltrán graduated from San Antonio High School in 1924 and began teaching Spanish and working for a Spanish language publishing firm. She wrote for Spanish-language journals in San Antonio and worked on radio. During this period she had a brief marriage and two daughters, Norma and Yolanda. At her death she had six grandchildren and many great grandchildren.
Life in Tucson
Between 1938 and 1942 Beltrán moved to Tucson, Arizona due to respiratory problems. She became active in the Mexican American community and started writing articles for the Spanish language newspaper El Tucsonense and producing a weekly radio program called "Theatre of the Air." The radio show, in Spanish, focused on religious themes that were approved by the local clergy and by Catholic Bishop Daniel J. Gercke. She also wrote plays which were performed on the radio and at Holy Family Church. Beltrán would go on to write for Arizona-based magazines, the English language Tucson Daily Reporter and columns for La Voz. She also worked professionally as a secretary in a law firm, an interpreter independently and for the Industrial Commission of Arizona.
In 1952 Beltrán created the performance México Ayer Y Hoy, which reflected on the history of Aztec, colonial and independent Mexico. The drama opened on September 15 at Tucson High School and later in other venues. She wrote the script, directed the performances and designed the costumes which were made by local community members. For the play and her activities within the Mexican American community she was awarded the Humanitarian Award from the Mexican American Unity Council and the City of Tucson's Amistad Award for her work with local radio station KUAT. She was awarded a César Award and in 1992 the Arizona Historical Society founded the Carmen Celiá Beltrán Hispanic Theatre Archives. She died 26 May 2002 from breast cancer.
Legacy
In 2006 Beltrán was honored with a place in the University of Arizona's Women's Plaza of Honor.

The Tonle Sap-Mekong peat swamp forests ecoregion (WWF ID: IM0165) covers a patchwork of areas permanently inundated with fresh water along the Tonle Sap River and Mekong River floodplains in Cambodia and Vietnam. The terrain is mostly flat, with extensive agricultural fields, reed beds, and degraded shrub forest. Less than 10% of the region is in its original state, and less than 1% is protected. Habitat in the region is distinguished from the Tonle Sap freshwater swamp forests ecoregion that runs through the middle, as that ecoregion is only seasonally flooded.
Location and description
There are four main sectors to the ecoregion. The smallest is northwest of Tonle Sap Lake on the outer edge of the lakes wetlands. A second sector is to the east of the Tonle Sap River. A third stretches across the Cambodia-Vietnam border on the left bank of the Mekong, and the fourth spreads along the south side of the Mekong Delta. The ecoregion is set back from the saltwater-affected coast, which is in the Indochina mangroves ecoregion. In much of the Vietnamese portions of the ecoregion, the water table rises to the surface, and the soils area heavy with organic material.
Climate
The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical savanna climate - dry winter (Köppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year, and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, and is drier than the average month.
Flora and fauna
85% of the region has been brought under cultivation; only 15% of the land is forested. On alluvial clay soils in the region there are extensive wetlands featuring sedge and grass species such as Phragmites karka, hardy sugar cane (Tripidium arundinaceum, and Coix gigantea. A type of swamp found nearest the brackish mangroves are known as 'paperbark swamps', dominated by Long-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendra), a member of the myrtle family. The paperbark swamps have been reduced but are currently the focus of reforesting efforts as they store water and help to reduce flooding.
Protected areas
Except for small portions of the ecoregion extending into the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve, there are few protected areas.

Epalzeorhynchos munense, also known as the redfin shark, is a species of cyprinid fish found in the Mekong, Chao Phraya and Mae Klong rivers basins in Indochina. It resembles the rainbow shark (E. frenatum) and the two have frequently been confused (the name red fin shark has been used for both). Unlike other Epalzeorhynchos species, E. munense is believed to be rare in the aquarium trade and is not known to be bred in commercial farms.

Dinah Morris is a major character in George Eliot's novel Adam Bede (1859); a Methodist lay preacher, she was modelled on Eliot's aunt Elizabeth Evans.
Dinah visits the fictional community of Hayslope — a rural, pastoral and close-knit community in 1799. She says to Lisbeth Bede in Chapter Ten, "I work in the cotton-mill when I am at home." She lives thirty miles away in the fictional Snowfield, in the fictional Stonyshire County.
Description
She is a cousin by marriage of Hetty Sorrel and related to the Poysers. Rachel Poyser, her aunt, wishes Dinah would stay with them in Hayslope.
Dinah is deeply religious, a follower of Wesleyan Methodism. She lives to comfort others, including Adam Bede's mother when her husband is drowned. She offers to help Hetty if she is ever in need. When Hetty commits her crime and cannot own up to it, Dinah's presence allows Hetty to face what she has done and ask for forgiveness.
At the beginning of the novel, Dinah lives at the Poyser farm because she is Mrs. Poyser's niece. Though she is an attractive woman, she seems to show no signs of self-consciousness while she preaches. In fact, she is sometimes considered to be Eliot's most confident female character.
According to Diana Neill, "The plot [of Adam Bede] is founded on a story told to George Eliot by her aunt Elizabeth Evans, a preacher, and the original of Dinah Morris of the novel, of a confession of child-murder, made to her by a girl in prison."
Dinah's preaching is extremely effective, persuading the exceptionally vain Bess to take off her gaudy earrings -- though only briefly. Her resistance to marriage, because she worries it would curtail her religious teaching, is resolved by Eliot in a manner calculated not to upset the male hierarchy: Dinah was not in fact kept from a traditional marriage by piety, but because no man she truly loved had yet asked her to marry him. Indeed, she turns into a typical housewife by the end of the novel, even consenting to discontinue her preaching because the Methodist men have decided against it.

Spinjas is a ratcheted spinning top game created by Tomy and distributed in North America by Parker Brothers in the late 1980s. The game set was sold as a Battle Stadium plastic arena with two Power Winder launchers and two Spinja characters enclosed within the arena, which doubles as a storage case. More characters, launchers, and an oversized playing arena were also made available separately. The objective of the game, similar to Beyblades, is to load your chosen character into the ratcheting launcher and each player would launch their top into the arena at the same time. The tops would ricochet off each other until only one remained spinning or within the arena and that player was declared the winner. Unlike Beyblades, the tops are not customizable and are not associated with any other licensed properties.
Characters
Spinjas consist of two teams: The Eliminators and The Dread Force; these two warring factions carry out their battles at the Earth's core.
The Eliminators are led by Emperor Gar and his lieutenant, Champion Shotgun. Two groups report to Champion Shotgun: a) The Fire Knights (red) which consist of Volcano, Nightmare, and Iron Top; and b) The Ice Knights (blue) which consist of Trident, Whipshot, and Blowgun.
The Dread Force are ruled by King Dethblo and his "right-hand mutant", Champion Switchblade. They also have two groups known as The Muckers (yellow) which include Bludgeon, Butcher, and Odor; and The Rotters (green) which is made up of the characters Sloth, Slug, and Maggot.
Each team also has a group of four "Stalkers", which act as spies for their respective leaders.
Emperor Gar's Stalkers consist of Tangle, Scorcher, Gash, and Blud; while King Dethblo's Stalkers are Mangle, Blowtorch, Klaw, and Gore.
There are a total of 24 characters in the game. The Eliminators and The Dread Force can be distinguished from one another by the colors of their spinning-tips. The Eliminators are steel-tipped and The Dread Force are brass-tipped. Each character is unique and has a slightly different spin due to weight distribution differences.
Spinjas have been re-released in Australia as WWE Spinjas, with different characters, but the same premise and equipment of an arena, and two spinners.

Grace Portolesi (born 26 June 1968) is an Australian politician who represented the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Hartley from 2006 to 2014 for the Labor Party.
Previously the parliamentary secretary assisting the Attorney-General, in 2010 Portolesi was appointed Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation, Multicultural Affairs, Youth and Volunteers. Portolesi was appointed Minister for Education and Child Development in 2011, a position she held until 2013. From 2013 to 2014 she was the Minister for Employment, Higher Education and Skills, Minister for Science and Information Economy, and a Member of the Executive Council. She is aligned with Labor's left faction.
Early life
Portolesi was born in Adelaide to a migrant Italian family. She studied public policy and government at Flinders University where she became involved in student politics, serving as president of the Flinders University Student Association. After leaving university without graduating, she worked as an equal opportunities officer at the University of South Australia.
Political career
In the early 1990s, she moved to Queensland to take up a position as an advisor to then Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss. She returned to Adelaide some years later to work as a policy advisor to then Opposition Leader, Mike Rann. When Labor won government in 2002, she took up the position of chief of staff for the Minister for Families and Community Services, Jay Weatherill, a position she held until her election to parliament in 2006.
2006 election
Portolesi decided to enter politics prior to the 2006 state election, and was nominated, unopposed, for preselection to the then highly marginal Liberal seat of Hartley. The traditionally Labor seat had been won by Joe Scalzi at the Liberal landslide of 1993, and as a popular local member, Scalzi went against the predictions to retain the seat in 1997 and 2002. Portolesi's status as an Italian-Australian broadened her support in the ethnically diverse community, and helped neutralise a factor that Scalzi had used to his advantage in the past.
Although Labor was widely expected to win several seats at the election, Hartley was expected to be a particularly close race, due to Scalzi's incumbency, personal support, and record of bucking wider electoral trends. The campaign in the seat was heavily presidential, with Premier Mike Rann strongly supporting Portolesi and doorknocking homes for her several times. Some local issues were raised, however, mostly in the form of policing and the fate of Lochiel Park, which had been threatened with development. Early polls placed Scalzi as the favourite, but Portolesi slowly narrowed the gap, and was leading the polls by January 2006. She seemed to suffer a major setback when polls in the week before the election returned to predicting a win for Scalzi. However, Portolesi achieved a 5.9 percent two-party swing to finish with a 4.6 percent margin.
The result was closer than in other similarly marginal seats, with Scalzi initially refusing to concede defeat, but the result had become clear by the end of the night, and he did so the following day. Three days later, it was announced that Portolesi would be appointed as a parliamentary secretary (assisting the Attorney-General) in the new government, the only one of the party's new recruits to gain such a position.
2010 election
At the 2010 state election, Portolesi held Hartley with a margin of 2.3 percent.
Portolesi was part of a successful campaign to reverse the closure of the Italian Consulate at Glynde which had been earmarked for closure by the Italian government.
2014 election
At the 2014 election, Hartley had undergone a significant redistribution, with Portolesi's margin reduced to 0.1 percent. She lost the seat to Liberal candidate Vincent Tarzia from a 2.6 percent two-party swing.
Political persuasion
Portolesi has been a vocal supporter of paid maternity leave, and established a select committee on work–life balance in her first year as the Member for Hartley. She dedicated her election in 2006 to 'working mums', and spoke in her maiden speech of the 'struggle to juggle' – the work–life balance.
In 2008 she introduced a private member's bill to protect patients' medical records after she was made aware that a landlord in her electorate was withholding 10,000 confidential records as part of a tenancy dispute. The legislation passed both Houses of the South Australian parliament.
Portolesi is in the left-wing of the Labor Party. She has shown support for same-sex unions and is a member of the pro-choice organisation for Australian women parliamentarians, Emily's List. She is an opponent of the Family First Party, and expressed relief at the conclusion of the 2006 campaign that she had been able to win the seat without their preferences.
Portolesi is a registered lobbyist in South Australia, listed as Grace Portolesi Connect.
Personal life
She is married to Advertiser journalist Miles Kemp and has a daughter, Allegra Kemp.

Buckenhof is a municipality in the district of Erlangen-Höchstadt, in Bavaria, Germany.
History
The village called Buckenhof developed between the 11th and 12th century. The first public record is from 1372.
Between the years 1564 and 1567, the barons von Haller build the Puckenhof Castle.
Since 1850, it houses a youth center of the Inner Mission.
Between 1886 and 1963, Buckenhof was located along the branch line from Erlangen to Uttenreuth.
Population development
Together with the neighboring Erlangen, Buckenhof experienced a tremendous increase in its population after the Second World War. Since 2000, Buckenhof is one of the most densely populated communities in Bavaria. The extraordinary popularity of the village, which is due to Buckenhof's location near the industrial center of Erlangen and at the same time its proximity to a large nature preserve, has resulted in high land prices.

GUIDE-Seq (Genome-wide, Unbiased Identification of DSBs Enabled by Sequencing) is a molecular biology technique that allows for the unbiased in vitro detection of off-target genome editing events in DNA caused by CRISPR/Cas9 as well as other RNA-guided nucleases in living cells. Similar to LAM-PCR, it employs multiple PCRs to amplify regions of interest that contain a specific insert that preferentially integrates into double-stranded breaks. As gene therapy is an emerging field, GUIDE-Seq has gained traction as a cheap method to detect the off-target effects of potential therapeutics without needing whole genome sequencing.
Principles
Conceived to work in concert with next-gen sequencing platforms such as Illumina dye sequencing, GUIDE-Seq relies on the integration of a blunt, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (dsODN) that has been phosphothioated on two of the phosphate linkages on the 5' end of both strands. The dsODN cassette integrates into any site in the genome that contains a double-stranded break (DSB). This means that along with the target and off-target sites that may exist as a result of the activity of a nuclease, the dsODN cassette will also integrate into any spurious sites in the genome that have a DSB. This makes it critical to have a dsODN only condition that controls for errant and naturally occurring DSBs, and is required to use the GUIDE-seq bioinformatic pipeline.
After integration of the dsODN cassette, genomic DNA (gDNA) is extracted from the cell culture and sheared to 500bp fragments via sonication. The resulting sheared gDNA undergoes end-repair and adapter ligation. From here, DNA specifically containing the dsODN insert is amplified via two rounds of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that proceeds in a unidirectional manner starting from the primers that are complementary to the dsODN. This process allows for the reading of the adjacent sequences, both the sense and anti-sense strands, flanking the insert. The final product is a panoply of amplicons, describing the DSB distribution, containing indices for sample differentiation, p5 and p7 Illumina flow-cell adapters, and the sequences flanking the dsODN cassette.
GUIDE-Seq is able to achieve detection of rare DSBs that occur with a 0.1% frequency, however this may be as a result of the limitations of next-generation sequencing platforms. The greater the depth of reads an instrument is able to achieve, the better it can detect rarer events. Additionally, GUIDE-Seq is able to detect sites not predicted by the "in silico" methods which often will predict sites based on sequence similarity and percent mismatch. There have been cases of GUIDE-Seq not detecting any off-targets for certain guide RNAs, suggesting that some RNA-guided nucleases may have no associated off-targets. GUIDE-Seq has been used to show that engineered variants of Cas9 can have reduced off-target effects.
Caveats
GUIDE-Seq has been shown to miss some off-targets, when compared to the genome-wide sequencing DIGENOME-Seq method, due to the nature of its targeting. Another caveat is that GUIDE-Seq has been observed to generate slightly different off-target sites depending on the cell line. This could be due to cell lines having different parental genetic origins, cell line specific mutations, or, in the case of some immortal cell lines such as K562s, having aneuploidy. This suggests that it would be pertinent for researchers to test multiple cell lines to validate efficacy and accuracy. GUIDE-Seq cannot be used to identify off-targets in vivo.

Joint Task Force Aztec Silence is a United States Department of Defense task force
conducting anti-terrorism operations. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on 1 March 2005, then-United States European Command commander General James L. Jones said:
EUCOM established Joint Task Force AZTEC SILENCE under the Commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in December 2003 to counter transnational terrorism in the under-governed areas of Northern Africa and to build closer alliances with those governments. In support of this, U.S. Navy intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets based in Sigonella, Sicily were used to collect and share information with partner nations and their militaries. This robust cooperative ISR effort was augmented by the release of intelligence collected by national assets.
The 'assets' at Sigonella are a rotational squadron of United States Navy P-3 Orions. "In March 2004, P-3 aircraft from this squadron and reportedly operating from the southern Algerian base at Tamanrasset were deployed to monitor and gather intelligence on the movements of Algerian Salafist guerrillas [the GSPC, now known as the Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb operating in Chad and to provide this intelligence to Chadian forces engaged in combat against the guerrillas."
Aztec Silence has also involved Special Operations Command, Europe personnel deploying to Algiers.

Saving Zoë is a 2019 American crime drama film directed by Jeffrey Hunt from a screenplay by LeeAnne H. Adams and Brian J. Adams, based on the 2007 novel of the same name by Alyson Noël. It stars Laura and Vanessa Marano in the lead roles alongside Chris Tavarez, Giorgia Whigham, Michael Provost, Nathaniel Buzolic, and Ken Jeong, and was released on July 12, 2019.
Plot
Echo, a freshman in high school, is attempting to come to terms with the loss of her older sister, Zoë, who was murdered a year ago. Echo's mother has been abusing antidepressants while her father works overtime. They regularly visit a family therapist, though Echo finds the sessions to be largely unhelpful. Zoë's boyfriend, Marc, was a prime suspect in her murder, and though the actual killer had confessed and was convicted, Echo remains suspicious of Marc. One day, Echo comes across Marc's new car, and sees Zoë's diary in the passenger seat. She shatters the window with a nearby rock to retrieve the diary, and brings it home with her. Once Echo begins reading, she learns of Zoë's plans to move to Los Angeles or New York after graduation to begin a modeling career. She also learns of an unnamed traumatic incident that happened to Zoë involving her best friend Carley and two older men named Jason and Tom.
Echo enlists Marc's help in infiltrating Jason's house to uncover the truth about what happened to Zoë. After school, Echo accompanies Carley to Jason's, though Carley seems apprehensive about letting her do so. Echo's boyfriend Parker insists on going with Marc once he realizes that she may be in trouble. Marc creates a diversion by crashing his car into Jason's outside, leading to a violent confrontation between the two and allowing Echo to sneak into the basement unnoticed. There, she finds a laptop containing video files of Jason and Tom raping several underage girls, one of them being Zoë - Carley had molested Zoë in the video as well, revealing that she has been luring underage girls to the men in exchange for drugs. Echo is caught by Carley, who confesses that Jason and Tom film the videos for their private child pornography website of which Zoë's murderer was a subscriber. Jason had blackmailed Zoë, promising that he would delete the video if Zoë met with his alleged photographer friend for a private photo shoot, leading to her murder.
Tom and Jason barge into the basement, knock out Carley, and tie Echo to the bed. They conspire to leave the state, but as Jason begins packing, an injured Marc stands up and knocks him unconscious. Parker arrives just as Echo frees herself, and he calls the police. Tom enters the basement, but Echo knocks him out before he can attack them. The two men are subsequently arrested for their crimes while their site is shut down.
Upon finishing the last entry in Zoë's diary, Echo, now having closure, says a final goodbye to her sister and apologizes for not knowing her well enough. Sitting at a bench at Zoë's favorite spot that has been built in her honor, Echo begins writing her first entry in the diary Zoë had planned to give her as a birthday gift.
Cast
Production
In 2018, it was revealed that the Marano sisters would appear in the lead roles. After joining the project, they commented in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, "When we optioned Alyson Noel's book Saving Zoe ten years ago, we did it because as a mother, as a daughter, as a sister, and as women, we were incredibly moved by a powerful story. Now, a decade later, that same powerful story seems to be more relevant than ever [...] We are ecstatic that Blue Fox was as moved today as we were all those years ago and are thrilled to be working with them. Together, we hope to share a film that we couldn't be more proud of with the world."
Release
In April 2019, it was revealed the film would be released on July 12, 2019.
Reception
Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times wrote, "But even with the occasional voiceover narration, the film can't quite replicate the appeal of Noël's original, where a lot of the action is internal, dealing with these women's opinions and feelings. The mystery plot isn't surprising enough — and it takes at least a few good jolts to create the cinematic equivalent of a page-turner." Danielle Solzman of the Solzy at the Movies wrote, "You're certainly welcome to give this film a chance but I left Saving Zoë feeling quite a bit disappointed. I do not see this film as being a complete disappointment but I believe that it could have been executed better. Saving Zoë honestly should have stayed a book." Jennie Kermode of the Eye for Film wrote, "Saving Zoe is, ultimately, a lightweight film about a serious subject. It's competently handled and Marano is an effective lead. It's likely to hit all the important notes for fans of the book but it does little more, avoiding risks and thereby failing to find a voice of its own. If you're in the target audience, then you'll find this a satisfying watch but it will be unlikely to stay with you."

John Aloysius Campbell (June 20, 1941 – October 19, 2008) was a timber executive who served as president of the Pacific Lumber Company in the 1990s.
Early life
Campbell was born on June 20, 1941, in Leura, New South Wales, outside of Sydney, Australia. His father was a recreational sailor who helped American ships navigate near the Great Barrier Reef, as part of assistance he provided to the United States Navy during World War II.
He obtained his early education in a one-room schoolhouse and later attended North Sydney Technical Collegeas well as Sydney Technical Institution for Wildlife Research.
Travels
Campbell won a national life-saving competition and was an experienced surfer. After service in the Australian Army, his world travels included journeys to England, where he surfed off the coast of Cornwall, and was said by his son as having introduced the sport to the area.
He traveled on to New York City, working at the Australian consulate there. He met his future wife Cynthia Carpenter in San Francisco, California, in 1966.
High-ranking executive
Campbell was hired by Ed Carpenter, one-time company president and Campbell's then father-in-law, to work the green chain sawmill. In time and through changes in administration he worked his way up the ranks to executive vice president in charge of forest products, by 1985; he was named as the firm's president after the company was the subject of a hostile takeover by Charles Hurwitz. Campbell was named chief executive in 1993.
In order to pay off the costs associated with the $900 million purchase of the company, Pacific Lumber increased the pace of cutting on the more than of timber it owned which included clusters of old-growth California redwoods. This more aggressive logging incurred the opposition of environmental groups, which staged protests aimed at stopping Pacific Lumber's logging efforts.
In 1999, Pacific Lumber's parent, Maxxam Inc., signed the Headwaters agreement, in which Pacific Lumber sold to the federal government and the State of California for $480 million, and the firm agreed to stricter environmental restrictions on logging on its remaining land.
In October 2001, Pacific Lumber named Robert E. Manne as president and CEO replacing Campbell, who became chairman of the firm's board of directors.
Personal life
Campbell divorced his first wife, and was survived by his wife of 18 years, Margaret R. Campbell, whom he had married in 1991. He died of cancer on October 19, 2008, in his home in Fortuna, California.
He was elected to the Fortuna city council in 2006 and was selected by his fellow council members to serve as the city's mayor, a position he held until his death.

Cluster grouping is an educational process in which four to six gifted and talented (GT) or high-achieving students or both are assigned to an otherwise heterogeneous classroom within their grade to be instructed by a teacher who has had specialized training in differentiating for gifted learners. Clustering can be contrasted with other ability-grouping strategies in which high achievers fill their own dedicated class, entirely separate from other students.
Cluster grouping is not experimental as it has been used successfully since 1974. While no single practice is a panacea for gifted instruction, Schuler's national survey showed a 99% positive approval rating among parents of clustered children and a 90% positive approval rating among the children themselves. Over two-thirds of administrators had a similar positive experience.
Although typically implemented in the upper elementary grades (3-6), cluster grouping has been used in grades K through 12. The methods for selecting children for cluster groups are usually similar to those for other gifted and talented services. Several instructional options are typically used within a cluster, including: enrichment and extensions, higher-order thinking skills, pretesting and differentiation, compacting, an accelerated pace, and more complex content."Through cluster grouping the intellectual, social, and emotional needs of the gifted students can be addressed."
For clustering to be effective, the teacher must be motivated to work with gifted children and receive specialized training, the curriculum for the cluster must be appropriately differentiated, and the remainder of the class cannot contain difficult or demanding students. Other anecdotal success factors for teachers include: fostering the valuing and acceptance of differences within the classroom, allowing pretesting and credit for previously mastered material, designing independent study that utilizes student passion, remaining flexible in teaching style, and maintaining a sense of humor.
Advantages
There is strong research evidence supporting the tutorial benefits of clustering gifted students during a single classroom.Rogers, Karen B, Ph.D., Re-forming Gifted Education (Great Potential Press, Scottsdale, AZ, 2002), pp. 249. consistent with one survey, advantages include: cost effectiveness, high challenge and expectations of scholars, faster progression through curricula, administrative ease in observation of services, increased understanding of GT students, and an improved opportunity to deal with the psychological needs of the GT students.Schuler Also, children with subject-specific giftedness, who might rather be excluded from gifted pull-outs, are often placed within the cluster classroom to require part in advanced work when appropriate.Winebrenner, pp. 177–178. Some research has shown that clustering grouping produces positive academic results for all children within the cluster classroom.Gentry, M. (1996), Cluster grouping: An investigation of student achievement, identification and classroom practices. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Connecticut, Storrs.</ref>
Concerns and criticism
Cluster grouping has experienced some negative reception. Teachers in schools that did not limit the extremes with the cluster classroom have expressed frustration at the required range of instruction. For this reason, Winebrenner recommends that the cluster classroom teacher not also have the neediest students. Some educators may become resentful if not selected as the cluster teacher. For fairness, the responsibility and opportunity of cluster grouping can be cycled in two-year terms through faculty members who are interested and have been trained in its use.
Administrators have at times resented special grouping, expressed frustration regarding scheduling, and have simply been biased against any programming for GT children. Difficulty can arise in placing gifted students who have recently moved into the school district.
Cluster grouping has been accused of denying academic leadership to other classes, but experience has proven otherwise. When gifted students are grouped for instruction, new leadership emerges among the remaining students. Clusters larger than six students have been criticized as unwieldy. In these cases, Winebrenner recommends splitting the group into two separate classrooms.
Parents may apply pressure for their children to be placed within the cluster classroom even if their child does not qualify for the cluster group and there is no research evidence of an inspirational effect. To address this problem, schools can ensure that all staff are trained in differentiation and that all non-GT students are cycled into a cluster classroom at an equal rate over the entirety of their school years.
Comparison to tracking, pull-outs, and mixed-ability groups
A comprehensive study of grouping by Rogers states, "Students who are academically or intellectually gifted and talented should spend the majority of their school day with others of similar abilities and interests." Magnet schools, schools within a school, and classrooms composed entirely of gifted students may not be appropriate in all districts. In these situations, the study goes on to state, "The Cluster Grouping of a small number of students, either intellectually gifted or gifted in a similar academic domain, within an otherwise heterogeneously grouped classroom can be considered when schools cannot support a full-time gifted program (either demographically, economically, or philosophically)."
Cluster grouping is distinct from tracking in that tracking organizes entire classrooms by ability, and little mobility exists between tracks as students progress through school. Conversely, cluster groups tend to expand over time rather than remain fixed.
While cluster groups allow GT children to spend the majority of their day with academic peers as recommended by research, pull-outs (also called "send-out" or "resource" programs) tend to meet one to two hours per week. A 1993 U.S. Government report found up to 72% of school districts using the pull-out approach despite this method being generally unsuccessful.<ref>"Part II. The Current Status of Education for the Nation's Most Talented Students," in National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent (online). Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, 1993)</ref> This lack of effectiveness has been echoed in more recent literature as well. Specifically, this is because pull-outs are often a hodgepodge of critical thinking, logic puzzles, and random subjects (e.g., mythology) which are unlikely to result in any significant academic progress because they are not tied directly to the core curriculum. However, properly-implemented pull-out programs can be used to complement cluster grouping.
Finally, mixed-ability grouping does not provide academic benefit to gifted children, and it can result in alienation and isolation of GT students. In mixed ability group projects, gifted children frequently do most of the work or teach the other children, which is not their responsibility and for which they have no certification.

John Arnold Fleming (1871 – 22 October 1966) was a Scottish industrial chemist closely associated with the British pottery industry. He was also a noted journalist, author, politician, and philanthropist. He was a keen amateur falconer and golfer. As an author he standardly appears as J. Arnold Fleming.
A proficient potter he ran potteries at an industrial level and was long associated with the Britannia Pottery in St Rollox in Glasgow, which he owned and controlled following his father's death, plus other Staffordshire Potteries. A substantial part of the ceramics collection within Glasgow Museums was gifted by Fleming.
Life
He was the eldest son of Sir James Fleming of Woodburn House in Rutherglen. He was educated at the Albany Academy in Glasgow then went to the Glasgow School of Art, specialising in modelling. He then went to the University of Edinburgh to study chemistry. He met John Logie Baird early in his life and they were lifelong friends. He donated a statue of Logie Baird to the town of Helensburgh and also created the John Logie Baird Memorial Prize at the local school.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1911. His proposers were James Readman, Robert Tatlock, John Glaister, John James Burnet and Sir Robert Rowand Anderson.
In 1922 general election he unsuccessfully stood as the Liberal candidate for the St Rollox constituency in Glasgow. In 1923 he sold the Britannia Pottery due to a slump in domestic ceramic sales. He then became a member both of Helensburgh Town Council and Dunbartonshire County Council. He held the rank of Baillie and donated a set of bells to the town hall clock. In 1965 he is also recorded as having paid a substantial proportion of the cost of the new clubhouse at Helensburgh Golf Club.
He died on 22 October 1966 at his home, Locksley on East Abercromby Street in Helensburgh.
Family
In 1914 he married Wilhelmina Reid, daughter of William Brand of Glasgow. They had no children.

Moynoe () is a civil parish in County Clare, Ireland. It is part of the Roman Catholic parish of Scarriff and Moynoe.
Location
Moynoe parish lies in the barony of Tulla Upper.
It is northeast of Scariff.
The parish is and covers .
On the northern boundary Lough Atorick has a surface-elevation of above sea-level. Most of the parish, apart from a district of beside Scariff bay on Lough Derg, is in the Slieve-Baughta mountains.
Settlements
The parish was originally called Moyno Norbree. Moyno means the plain of the yew tree, but the meaning of Norbree is unknown.
As of 1897 the ruin of the old church was in reasonably good condition.
Near it a ruined arch was probably a gateway that led to Moynoe castle, the property of Edmond O'Grady.
Further off is a holy well dedicated to Saint Mochunna, the patron saint of Feakle as well as of Moynoe.
The parish contains the townlands of Cappaghabaun Mountain, Cappaghabaun Park, Carrowmore, Meenross, Moynoe, Pollagoona Mountain, Sheeaun, Tobernagat and Turkenagh Mountain.
The population in 1841 was 1,475 in 237 houses and the main hamlet was Coolcoosaun.
Church history
In 1633 Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, bought ten quarters of land north of the Graney River in the Tuamgraney parish, including the castle and ironworks of Scarriff.
These lands were combined with the old Moynoe parish to form the Scariff parish.
Today Scariff and Moynoe is a parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe.

The Battle of the Tonelero Pass, also known as Passage of the Tonelero, was a battle fought near the cliff of Acevedo, in the west bank of the Paraná River, Argentina, on 17 December 1851, between the Argentine Confederation Army commanded by Lucio Norberto Mansilla and warships of the Brazilian Imperial Navy led by John Pascoe Grenfell.
Background
The battle
On 17 December 1851, the Brazilian fleet commanded by Grenfell was near the cliff of Acevedo in the river Paraná, with the intention to break through the Argentine defenses at the Tonelero pass. There were eight Brazilian warships: four steam corvettes, Dom Pedro, Dom Pedro II, Dom Afonso and Recife, that towed two sailing corvettes, Dona Francisca and União, plus a brig, Calíope. On board Grenfell's flagship, Dom Afonso, were Brigadier General Marques de Sousa and the Argentines Colonel Wenceslao Paunero, Lieutenant-Colonel Bartolomé Mitre and Lieutenant-Colonel Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. The ships ferried half of the troops that composed the 1st Division of Imperial Infantry. The rest of the division was waiting at Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay.
To oppose the passage, there were 16 artillery pieces and 2,000 soldiers commanded by Lucio Norberto Mansilla, son-in-law of the leader of the Argentine Confederation, Juan Manuel de Rosas. For one hour the Argentines fired more than 450 cannon rounds in the direction of the Brazilian ships, causing little damage to the warships, but killing four sailors and wounding another five. The warships fired back, although they failed to cause any major damage to the Argentine forces, only killing eight and wounding twenty. Other sources say that the argentine artillery caused heavy damage to the warships.
The squadron landed the troops at Diamante, Entre Ríos and part of the ships returned to bring the other battalions that stayed behind in Colonia.
Mansilla believed that the Brazilian division was going to land right on his main position. He fled along with his men, leaving all the artillery and other equipment behind.

Pedro Jaime Esteve (latinicized: Estevius, Catalan: Pere Jaume Esteve; c. 1500 in Sant Mateu del Maestrat – 1556 in Valencia) was a Spanish doctor, botanist, and humanist.
Life and work
Pedro Jaime Esteve studied in Valencia, Paris, and Montpellier. Later, he worked as a professor of medicine and mathematics at the University of Valencia. In 1551, he published the Hippocratic work "Epidemics II" in Greek, with numerous illustrations and a Latin translation. This book was the medical foundation of humanism in Spain. In 1552, he published a critical edition of "Theriaca", a work on the poisons and bites of snakes and scorpions, by the ancient Greek doctor Nicander of Colophon. He made his Latin hexameter version available with Latin and Catalan nomenclature and taxonomy of some plants from the region of Valencia. Later, Esteve wrote a volume on medicinal herbs, which, however, has been lost.
Notes
The American plant genus Stevia is named after Pedro Jaime Esteve.

The original Dark Sun Boxed Set is an accessory for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, published in 1991. It introduces the Dark Sun campaign setting for the game.
Contents
The package includes two thick campaign guides, a booklet titled A Little Knowledge (featuring a short story and a couple of Monstrous Compendium entries), a pair of colorful maps, and a set of spiral-bound flip books featuring an introductory adventure.
One of the campaign guides, called The Wanderer's Journal, explains the background of the Dark Sun world and is written in the style of a first-person memoir. The other campaign guide details the new rules for the setting. The flip books are made of cardstock pages bound by metal spirals, and the back covers have accordion folds so that the books can stand upright on a table. The Dungeon Master's Book details a simple adventure, complete with encounter descriptions, game statistics, and role-playing notes. The Player Aid Cards contain pictures and diagrams to be shown to the players during key points of the adventure.
Athas has been devastated as the result of magic run amok, leaving most of Athas as an empty desert, interrupted by a handful of corrupt city states controlled by power-mad sorcerer-kings and their spell-wielding lackeys. Slavery is commonplace, gladiatorial duels provide entertainment for the elite, and treachery and death permeate the culture. As rain falls only once per decade in some areas, water is more precious than gold. Travelers risk dehydration from the scorching heat, ambushes from brutal elven raiders, and attacks from giant tentacles lurking in the dust-filled Sea of Silt. Owing to the scarcity of natural resources, few wizards have access to books made of paper pages and hard covers; instead, they record their spells with string patterns and complex knots. Metal is also rare, affecting both the economy and the quality of equipment. The ceramic coin, made from clay and glazed in various colors, is the primary medium of exchange, worth about a hundredth of a gold piece. Weapons typically consist of obsidian, bone, and wood, and are prone to break. Only a single dragon exists in all of Athas, a monstrosity with supra-genius intelligence whose appearance heralds disasters of catastrophic proportions.
Dark Sun characters are considerably tougher than their counterparts in other AD&D settings. All characters begin at 3rd level, and ability scores may be raised higher than those of ordinary AD&D characters. PCs start the game with three times the funds stated in the "Money and Equipment" chapter of the Player's Handbook. All Dark Sun campaign PCs have at least one psionic talent, as described in The Complete Psionics Handbook. Athasian dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200 lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires at least a week to complete. Athasian elves are hostile nomads, marked by savage dispositions and a deep distrust of outsiders. The wiry halflings seldom exceed 3½' in height and live in shaman-ruled settlements in the jungles beyond the mysterious Ringing Mountains. Three new races also flourish in Athas: muls (the exceptionally strong offspring of dwarves and humans, commonly used for slave labor), half-giants (a cross between giants and humans who choose new alignments every morning), and thri-kreen (savage insect men, also known as mantis warriors, with venomous saliva and armorlike exoskeletons). Player-characters may be drawn from any of the races, including the three new ones. For character classes, the warrior category incorporates fighters and the rangers, but excludes paladins, who do not exist in Athas. The warrior class also includes a new archetype called the gladiator. Disciplined in a variety of combat techniques, gladiators are automatically proficient in all weapons, receive a bonus to punching and wrestling attack rolls, and are allowed to specialize in multiple weapons. Thieves and bards are also included. Priests comprise three distinct categories: clerics, who derive their powers directly from the elemental planes; templars, who serve the sorcerer-kings and are dependent on them for magical energy; and druids, who are bound to the essence of a particular oasis or other geographic location. Dark Sun world wizards include defilers, whose powers come at the expense of the ecosystem; preservers, who wield magic in concert with the environment; and illusionists, specialists in illusory effects who may be either defilers or preservers. The Dark Sun rules encourage players to follow the alignment guidelines used in other AD&D campaigns, though allowances are made for extreme circumstances.
No deities exist in Athas. Instead, clerics worship natural forces, represented by the elemental planes of earth, air, fire, and water. The only spheres accessible to Athasian clerics are those corresponding to the elemental planes, along with the catch-all Sphere of the Cosmos. Additionally, clerics and druids may tap into magical plants called trees of life once per day, to gain heal, augury, divination, and magic font spells. Wizardly magic derives directly from the life forces inherent in the ecosystem. Defilers have no qualms about exploiting the environment, as every spell they cast sucks the life from the surrounding area and turns it into a sterile wasteland. The "Defiler Magical Destruction Table" indicates the effects of defiler magic on the immediate terrain. Preservers, striving to wield magic in harmony with nature, cause no damage to the environment when they cast spells. However, preservers advance in level at a much slower rate than the self-serving defilers.
Publication history
The Dark Sun boxed set was published by TSR, Inc. as a boxed set with a 96-page "Rules Book", a 96-page "Wanderer's Journal", a 16-page "A Little Knowledge" booklet, two 24-page spiral-bound flip books, one single-sided 21" × 32" map sheet, one 21" × 36" double-sided map sheet, and one 21" × 32" poster. Design was by Timothy B. Brown and Troy Denning with editing by William W. Connors and J. Robert King, and black-and-white art by Brom and Tom Baxa, and color art by Brom.
Reception
Rick Swan reviewed the Dark Sun Boxed Set for Dragon magazine #185 (September 1992). He gives an overview of the set: "Using the desert as a metaphor for struggle and despair, this set presents a truly alien setting, bizarre even by AD&D game standards. From dragons to spell-casting, from character classes to gold pieces, this set ties familiar AD&D conventions into knots, resulting in one of the most fascinating and original game worlds that TSR has ever produced." He said that the campaign guides are "well-written, clearly organized, and liberally illustrated with evocative black-and-white artwork".

In , he became the owner of the Philadelphia Athletics of the Players' League. After the PL folded at the end of that season, Wagner joined a syndicate of PL owners, led by Al Johnson of the Cleveland Infants, that purchased the Cincinnati Reds. However, the purchase was revoked by the National League. Instead, Wagner settled for his own Athletics being admitted to the American Association for the 1891 season.
Senators: 1892-1899
When the AA also folded after the 1891 season, the Athletics were not among the teams absorbed into the NL, which already had a team in Philadelphia.

Rajnandgaon is a district of the state of Chhattisgarh in central India. The administrative headquarters the district is Rajnandgaon town.
History
In ancient times Rajnandgaon, like the rest of the Chhattisgarh plain, was part of Dakshina Kosala. The region was part of the Mauryan empire during Ashoka's time. Coins of the Indo-Sassanians have been found near Rajnandgaon dating from the 3rd century CE, implying the region had indirect contact with the rest of the world. In the 4th century CE, Dakshina Kosala was one of the regions which was subdued by Samudra Gupta on his southern expedition. However it was unlikely the Guptas ever directly controlled this territory south of the Mahanadi, rather the local rulers acknowledged Gupta overlordship. Gupta coins have been found in Dakshina Kosala. Parts of the region were controlled by the Nalas of Bastar at times, while others areas were controlled by the Vakatakas for periods in the 5th century CE.
In the 6th century CE, the area was under the control of the Somavamshis. In the 7th century however, the territory fell back into Nala hands.
In the 10th century CE, the Somavamshis returned to power. They were soon overthrown by the Kalachuris, who claimed Haihaiya origin. In the 12th and 13th centuries CE, the southern part of the district fell into the control of chieftains from Kanker. The Kalachuris or Haihaiyavansis continued ruling the district until the 18th century CE. Khairagarh and the northern part of the district was ruled by the Raj Gonds of Garha-Mandla. After the struggle of Rani Durgavati, these rulers, as well as the Kalachuris of Raipur who ruled the southern part of the district, became vassals of the Mughals.
In 1742, the Marathas under the Bhonsles of Napur invaded Chhattisgarh. The Maratha general, Bhaskar Pant, quickly overthrew the last king of the Haihaiyavansis and took over what is now Rajnandagaon district. In 1753, the Bhonsles of Nagpur confiscated all the territory that is now Chhattisgarh, and Raghoji gave the area to his son, Bimbaji, who ruled it virtually independently.
The territory continued to be controlled by the Marathas until the Third Anglo-Maratha War, when it fell into British hands. In 1818, Dongargarh revolted against the British, but was quickly crushed. The British balanced the accounts of the Marathas and then returned the territory to Maratha hands. Until 1836 it was administered by a series of subadars obedient to the Nagpur state. In 1853, Nagpur was annexed by the British under the Doctrine of Lapse and Rajnandgaon fell under direct British administration under the Central Provinces and Berar.
In 1906, Thakur Pyarelal Singh promoted the Swadeshi movement in the district. Later he helped organize mill workers in Rajnandgaon in a successful 34-day strike after the passage of the Rowlatt Act. For this he was punished by the authorities of Rajnandgaon state, but later wrote to the British agent to get the order cancelled. The people of the princely states participated in all the major events of the Independence movement, including the Civil Disobedience Movement that saw the British officials pass orders to quell the movement. In 1939, the people of Rajnandgaon state launched a Forest Satyagraha, in which the police fired on protestors, killing one.
The Rajnandgaon remained a Princely State in independent India. In 1948, the princely state and the capital city Rajnandgaon was merged into the Durg District of Madhya Bharat, later Madhya Pradesh. Rajnandgaon district was carved out from the erstwhile Durg district on 26 January 1973. Later, Kabirdham district was carved out from this district on 1 July 1998.
It is a part of the Red Corridor.
The collector of Rajnandgaon is Shri Jaiprakash Maurya.
Geography
The district covers an area of 8222 km2. The district borders Kabirdham district in the north, Bemetara, Durg and Balod districts in the east, Kanker district in the south, Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh and Gondia and Gadchiroli districts of Maharashtra in the west.
Most of the district is in the Chhattisgarh plain. This plain comprises two watersheds: that of the Wainganga in the west, and that of the Mahanadi in the east. The Shivnath, main tributary of the Mahanadi, has its source in the district, and flows through the central plain into Durg district. In the northwest, bordering Balaghat and Kabirdham districts, is the Maikal Hills, the eastern extension of the Satpuras. In the far south is the northernmost extension of the Bastar Plateau. Both the hills and plateau are sparsely populated with a majority-tribal population and retain thick forest cover, which has generally been lost in the rest of the district.
Demographics
According to the 2011 census Rajnandgaon district has a population of 1,537,133, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii. This gives it a ranking of 325th in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 19.82%. Rajnandgaon has a sex ratio of 1017 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 76.97%. After bifurcation the district had a population of 884,742. 24.83% of the population lives in urban areas. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes make up 95,782 (10.83%) and 174,731 (19.75%) of the population respectively.
The main Scheduled Castes are Chamar and Mahar, which make up 91% of the Scheduled Castes population. The main Scheduled Tribes are the Gonds, other major tribes are the Kawar and Halba. These three tribes make up 97% of the total Scheduled Tribes population.
At the time of the 2011 Census of India, 82.37% of the population in the district spoke Chhattisgarhi, 13.26% Hindi and 1.73% Marathi as their first language.
Tourist destinations
A tehsil headquarters, Dongargarh, is the main tourist as well as pilgrimage site of the district. The famous temple of Goddess Bamleshwari, on a hilltop of in the town of Dongargarh, is referred to as Badi Bamleshwari. Another temple, at ground level, is situated about 1/2 km from the main temple complex. This temple is known as Chhoti Bamleshwari. Many hundreds of thousands of people from in and around Chhattisgarh flock to the shrine during the navratris of Kavar (during Dussera) and Chaitra (during Ramnavmi). During these navratris, melas (fairs) which run 24 hours are organised in the premises of the temple.
Another site of interest is the ancient place of Mata Sheetala Devi Shakti Peetha. This temple, which dates from 2200 years ago, lies 1.5 km from the railway station. The Mandir Trust has organised the Mela of Maa Bamleshwari and a lot of devotees visit during Mela period. Chotti mata mandir reconstruction in famous pink sandstone and marble stone. Pragyagiri, a famous Buddhist Vihara is another attraction of this district. Barfani dham at Rajnandgaon town is another place of pilgrims widely visited.

The Resources Industry Development Board (RIDB) was formed in 2000 to enhance the growth of the state of South Australia's mineral and petroleum resources sector and its contribution to the state's economy. It was formed in response to recommendations of the Resources Task Force made the previous year. The RIDB provided advice to the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy and the state government. There was a high degree of inter-activity with the Primary Industries and Regions SA (PIRSA) Division of Minerals and Energy which also provided the Board's secretariat.
In 2015, the RIDB merged with the Resources & Energy Sector Infrastructure Council (RESIC), forming the Minerals & Energy Advisory Council.
Objectives
As of 2014, the board's key objectives were:
Making land more accessible
Stimulating vibrant exploration activity
Expediting sustainable development, production and processing
Achievements
During its first five years, the RIDB successfully engaged the Economic Development Board to raise the profile of the resources sector. In 2004, this resulted in the sector being recognised as one of the four key potential growth areas in the state's Second Economic Summit. The resources sector was not mentioned at the First Economic Summit. The RIDB also met with the Minister for Environment and Conservation, Hon John Hill to highlight key issues for the resources industry. These included increasing access to parks and reserves and the management of zones within reserves.
The RIDB developed a strategy for the targeted promotion of the sector to opinion leaders and corporate decision makers. The project aimed to identify and engage people who influence community opinion to alter the community's perception of the resources industry. The targets of the strategy included church leaders, sporting identities, councils, business leaders, service and community organisations, politicians, bureaucrats, media personalities, unions and conservation groups.
Membership
In 2014, members of the Board (and their relevant industry affiliations) included:
Keith Yates - Adelaide Resources
Dr Paul Heithersay
Dr Ian Gould - Rio Tinto & University of South Australia

Joseph Gascoigne (died 1728) of Chiswick, Middlesex and Weybridge, Surrey, was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1722 to 1728.
Gascoigne may have been related to Joseph Gascoigne (died 1685), chandler, of Chiswick, and Benjamin Gasoigne (died 1731), also of Chiswick who was father of Joseph and Sir Crisp Gascoigne, Lord mayor of London in 1752.
Gascoigne was agent victualler for Port Mahon in 1709 and became Receiver-general in Minorca from 1712 until his death. At the 1722 general election he stood as a government supporter and was elected Member of Parliament for Wareham where he had no prior connection. He was again successful at the 1727 general election. There is no record of his speaking or voting in Parliament
Gascoign living at Weybridge, Surrey in June 1725, when he received a grant of arms. He died on 1 September 1728, leaving two daughters, Aline and Theodosia, to whom administration was granted.

The Norton ES2 is a Norton motorcycle produced from 1927 until 1964. From 1965, a different machine was produced for a short time by parent manufacturer AMC, based on a Matchless but badged as Norton ES2 Mk2.
Development
It was a long stroke single, always 79mm x 100mm bore and stroke, originally launched as a sports motorcycle but throughout its long life it was gradually overtaken by more powerful models.
It remained popular due to its reliability and ease of maintenance, as well as the traditional design. From 1947 the ES2 had an innovative hydraulically damped telescopic front fork and race developed rear plunger suspension. From 1953 it had a single downtube swinging-arm frame.
Featherbed frame
From 1959 it used the Rex McCandless designed Featherbed frame, with upgrades featuring an improved AMC gearbox, revised cylinder head, crankshaft-mounted Lucas RM15 60-watt alternator with coil ignition and an 8-inch front brake with full width hubs front and rear. The wideline Featherbed-framed bike was road tested in The Motorcycle 4 June 1959 issue and was reported to have a mean top speed of 82 mph with petrol consumption of 56 mpg at 60 mph.
Slimline featherbed frame
For 1961, in common with other large-engined Nortons, the bike was further improved with the Slimline frame with upper frame rails narrowed and a restyled slimmer fuel tank.
Finale
The last ES2 was introduced in late 1964. A Matchless-based machine with Norton badges, it was produced for two years before final discontinuation, coincident with the commercial failure of the AMC Group.
A report in a 1980 UK magazine stated:The slow but immensely likeable Featherbed-framed 350 Model 50 and 500 ES2 Norton ohv singles were dropped and in their place appeared the Model 50 MkII and ES2 MkII, or, with Norton badges hastily tacked on the side, the Matchless G3 and G80. They failed to fool anyone, let alone the buying public. In 1966 the heavyweight singles were all but a memory...

An astronomical complex or commemorative astronomical complex is a series of man-made structures with an astronomical purpose. It has been used when referring to a group of Megalithic structures that it is claimed show high precision astronomical alignments. For the study of Archaeoastronomy, such complexes of similar structures are required for adequate measurement and calculation to ensure that similar celestial sightlines were intended by the designers. These arrangements have also been known as observational, ceremonial or ritual complexes with importance for the study of prehistoric cultures.
The term has been used in the naming of various series of observatories used for observing the stars in modern times.
Ancient astronomical complexes
Examples of suggested ancient astronomical complexes that may have been used as solar and lunar observatories include, in reverse-chronological order:
Mesoamerica
The E-group ruins of a plaza with three temples and two viewing platforms at Uaxactún, near the Petén Basin, Guatemala, accredited to the Mayan civilization referred to as a Complejo Conmemorativo Astronomico.
Western Europe
It has been suggested that the grouping of stone circles and ridge-top cairns on Bodmin Moor in Cornwall compose a ritual or astronomical complex.
Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, United Kingdom.
The Callanish Complex of megaliths in the Hebrides islands.
The series of recumbent stone circles in Aberdeenshire in the North East of Scotland, including Balquhain stone circle and the cupmarked stone on its west flank.
Wandlebury Hill, Portingbury Warren Mound in Portingbury Hills and a series of 11 marker stones including the Leper Stone in Cambridgeshire and Essex in England, also known as the Wandlebury Enigma or The Wandlebury-Hatfield Heath Astronomical Complex.
Central Europe
Goseck circle and other Neolithic circular enclosures in Central Europe
Nile Valley
The circular stone structure (calendar circle) at Nabta Playa in Egypt dating to the 5th millennium BC is believed to be the among the oldest astronomical complexes in the world.
Levant
In 2006, then Atlit Yam was discovered in Israel in 2009, dated with certainty to at least 6300 BCE, at which point it was abandoned and submerged in the Mediterranean, but still being excavated and analyzed as of 2014. Atlit Yam has human skeletons ceremoniously buried, and is a small semi-circle of long, narrow uprighted stones etched with cup marks.
Rogem Hiri, 40,000,000 kg of stone with a 'gate' or opening in the outer stone circle through which the sun rises on each Summer Solstice (with this 'gate' matching the Summer Solstice's sunrise even more accurately millennia ago), and a burial chamber in the center under two 5-tonne megaliths, a layer of circa 3,000 BCE exposed, with a surveyed but unexcavated, estimated 4,000 BCE, layer beneath.
Mnajdra and other Megalithic Temples of Malta, circa 3100 BCE and younger.
Modern astronomical complexes
Examples of modern astronomical complexes of stellar observatories include:
The Leoncito Astronomical Complex in the San Juan Province of Argentina.
The University of Idaho Astronomical Complex in the United States of America.
The research and observational centre at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) and its observatories, the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, on La Palma and the Observatorio del Teide, on Tenerife.

Šator () is a mountain in the Dinaric Alps, in the western regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The name šator means "tent". The highest peak Veliki Šator is above sea level. Dimensions of the mountain are some in the west–east and in the north–south direction.
The mountain area includes a lake, rich flora and fauna, numerous geomorphological and hydrological phenomena, as well as the aesthetic appearance in general.
Geography
Šator rises some 1000 meters above high plains and enormous karstic fields which surround it. These plains are among highest and most spacious karstic fields in the Dinaric Alps and certainly in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
On the south is Livanjsko Polje field located some above sea level, which is over long. Šator rises from its north - north-west end.
In the opposite direction, south - south-east, are Mount Staretina, peaking at above sea level, and Mountain Golija, above sea level. These mountains divide the Livanjsko field from the Glamočko Polje field.
To the east is a huge grassy plain, which is around above sea level. To the north is deep valley where the Unac River emerge and Župica Lake. On the north-west is an grassy plateau, and a mountain of Jadovnik.
The spacious and grassy Grahovsko Polje field is on the west, with an altitude above sea level of around meters. At the middle of the Grahovsko field is a small town of Bosansko Grahovo at an altitude around above sea level, a place which is a main approach to Šator. This whole area is bounded with a long mountain chain, which includes the peaks of Dinara on the border with Croatia.
Peaks
Šator peaks start rising with a sort of plateau meters above sea level, at the end of the dense forests of beech, fir and spruce. Those 5 peaks have a shape like tent and form a string in east–west direction. That is almost perpendicular to most of Dinaric Alps mountains, which stretch in southeast–northwest direction.
From a distance the whole mountain gives the impression of tent and that is how it got its name ( = ).
The highest peak, on the western end, is Veliki Šator ( = ) which rises to above sea level, while somewhat isolated, on the eastern end, is Mali Šator ( = ), slightly shorter at . Two of the remaining three peaks exceed above sea level, while the third, the neighbor of Mali Šator, exceeds above sea level.
Flora and fauna
South slopes of Šator are grassy, in spring covered with carpets of flowers. On the opposite, north side are steep cliffs and scree slopes (also: talus piles) and karst depression with a lot of dwarf pine.
Šator and area around the mountain were enormous pastures for thousands of cattle, which were driven from as far as Dalmatia, but are now almost depopulated.
Tourism
Šator is a tame mountain in general, in a sense, and therefore more suitable for family trips instead of serious mountaineering. A mountain road that reaches Šatorsko Lake at above sea level, grassy slopes, carpets of flowers and dense forests make this mountain attractive for visitors.

Jessamine County () is a county located in the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2020 census, the population was 52,991. Its county seat is Nicholasville. The county was founded in December 1798. Jessamine County is part of the Lexington-Fayette, KY Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is within the Inner Blue Grass region, long a center of farming and blooded stock raising, including thoroughbred horses. The legislature established a commercial wine industry here in the late 18th century.
History
Jessamine County was established in 1798 from land given by Fayette County. Jessamine was the 36th Kentucky county in order of formation. The county is claimed to be named for a Jessamine Douglass, the daughter of a pioneer settler, who was either killed by Native Americans or committed suicide after being unlucky in love, but that story is dismissed by modern scholars, who say the name is from Jessamine Creek and the jasmine flowers that grow next to it. Most of the early pioneers were from Virginia, who came through the mountains after the American Revolutionary War.
In the late 18th century, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a bill to establish a commercial vineyard and winery, based in Nicholasville and the first in the United States, known as First Vineyard. Wine making based on European grapes became widespread in the United States. After the Prohibition era, which lasted from 1920 to 1933, the county voted to prohibit alcohol sales. As it allowed an exception for the "wet" city of Nicholasville, where package alcohol sales are allowed, it is classified as "dry." The Chrisman Mill Vineyards is authorized to operate and sell its product in the dry portion of the county.
Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.4%) is water. In 2000, nearly of the county's total area was dedicated to agriculture.
The county's entire southern border is formed by the Kentucky River. Jessamine County's river bank extends roughly long due to meandering, and the river's scenic Palisades feature heavily along this border.

The National Heritage List for England (NHLE) is England's official database of protected heritage assets. It includes details of all English listed buildings, scheduled monuments, register of historic parks and gardens, protected shipwrecks, and registered battlefields. It is maintained by Historic England, a government body, and brings together these different designations as a single resource even though they vary in the type of legal protection afforded to them. Although not designated by Historic England, World Heritage Sites also appear on the NHLE; conservation areas do not appear since they are designated by the relevant local planning authority.
The passage of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882 established the first part of what the list is today, by granting protection to 50 prehistoric monuments. Amendments to this act increased the levels of protection and added more monuments to the list. Beginning in 1948, the Town and Country Planning Acts created the first listed buildings and the process for adding properties to it. , more than 600,000 properties are listed individually. Each year additional properties are added to the national list, via the registers that comprise the list.
The National Heritage List for England was launched in 2011 as the statutory list of all designated historic places including listed buildings and scheduled monuments.
The list is managed by Historic England (formerly part of English Heritage), and is available as an online database with over 400,000 listed buildings, registered parks, gardens and battlefields, protected shipwrecks and scheduled monuments. A unique NHLE reference number is frequently used to refer to the related database entry; for example, 1285296 refers to Douglas House, a Grade II* listed building in the London Borough of Richmond upon the Thames.

The 19th Airlift Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the 60th Operations Group, Travis Air Force Base, California. The last sortie was flown on 2 August 1996 and the unit inactivated effective 30 September 1996.
History
World War II
The 19th Airlift Squadron was constituted as the 19th Transport Squadron on 22 November 1940. It was activated on 1 January 1941 at Hickam Field, Hawaii, the squadron was assigned to Hawaiian (later, Seventh) Air Force, flying the Douglas C-33 (DC-2). During the course of World War II, the squadron would conduct aerial transportation within the Hawaiian Islands and to forward bases in the Pacific. In May 1942, the squadron was moved over to the adjoining John Rogers Airport (now Honolulu International Airport) due to space issues at Hickam.
The squadron was re-designated the 19th Troop Carrier Squadron on 5 July 1942. That same year, the unit transitioned to the C-53 aircraft. The following year, it converted to the C-57 and C-47. In 1944, the Squadron added the C-45 to its inventory. On 15 August, the 19th became assigned to VI Air Service Area Command and the following year, on 15 December 1945, to AAF, Middle Pacific.

With the end of the war, the 19th continued its intra-theater operations in the Hawaiian Islands. It was reassigned 4-engined C-54 Skymasters and also C-46 Commandos. In 1948 it was transferred to Bergstom AFB in Texas and assigned to Tactical Air Command. However, the squadron deployed to Wiesbaden Air Base in Germany in June 1948 in response to the urgent need for C-54 transports due to the Berlin Airlift. There it flew constant missions in the Berlin Air Corridor to airports in West Berlin and back to Wiesbaden. The 19th remained in Occupied Germany until it was inactivated on 26 August 1948 with its aircraft being assigned to other units in Occupied Germany.
It was re-designated as the 19th Troop Carrier Squadron, Medium, on 23 May 1952, the squadron was reactivated on 10 June 1952 at Brady AB, Japan. The squadron flew with the C-46 aircraft under the 315th Troop Carrier Group. Its mission at Brady was to provide passenger transportation between South Korea, Japan and other US bases in the Western Pacific. The squadron inactivated on 18 January 1955 due to budget reductions.
Modern era
The last generation of the squadron was activated as the 1403d Military Airlift Squadron, which was designated, and activated, on 1 August 1984 at Yokota Air Base in Japan. The squadron had been attached to 316th Tactical Airlift Group, and then the 374th Tactical Airlift Wing starting on 1 October 1989. Its mission was to provide intra-theater airlift for high-ranking PACAF and civilian officials and small mission–essential equipment, flying C-12 Huron twin-engine prop planes, and in 1985, upgrading to the C-21 Learjet. The squadron was designated the 19th Airlift Squadron on 1 April 1992 and assigned to the 316th Airlift Support Group, before being reassigned on 1 June 1992 to the 374th Operations Groups.
The 19th AS was transferred to the 60th Operations Group, Travis AFB, California on 1 November 1993, in a name-only re-designation of the 7th Airlift Squadron. Its VIP aircraft at Yokota were transferred back to the United States. In turn, the 19th took over the C-141B Starlifters and mission of the 7th as part of the re-designation, as part of an Air Force initiative to retain low-numbered units on active duty. With a final flight and inactivation ceremony on 2 Aug 1996, the squadron was inactivated on 30 September 1996 as part of the retirement of the C-141 fleet.

HMCS Quesnel was a of the Royal Canadian Navy that took part in convoy escort duties during the Second World War. She primarily saw service in the Battle of the Atlantic. She was named after Quesnel, British Columbia.
Background
Flower-class corvettes like Quesnel serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The "corvette" designation was created by the French for classes of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name "flower" was used to designate the class of these ships, which – in the Royal Navy – were named after flowering plants.
Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas.
Construction
Quesnel was originally ordered by the Royal Navy 4 February 1940 as part of the 1939-1940 Flower-class building program. She was laid down by the Victoria Machinery Depot Company Ltd. in Victoria, British Columbia on 9 May 1940 and launched 12 November 1940. She was commissioned on 23 May 1941, at Esquimalt.
On 15 May 1941 Quesnel was one of ten corvettes loaned to Canada. She could be told apart from other Canadian Flower-class corvettes by her lack of minesweeping gear and the siting of the after gun tub amidships. However, Quesnel was completed after the exchange, so she was commissioned with a Canadian name and not a flower name like the other nine that had been transferred.
Wartime service
Upon commissioning, Quesnel patrolled the Pacific Coast as a member of Esquimalt Force. During the spring of 1942 she was doing anti-submarine patrols in the Straits of Georgia, the Queen Charlotte Sounds and Millbank Sounds. It was during this time that she was detailed to screen while she was waiting to go into drydock.
On 20 June 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine shelled the lighthouse at Estevan Point on Vancouver Island, while , under the command of Commander Akiji Tagami, torpedoed and shelled the freighter off Cape Flattery. The freighter did not sink and she was towed to safety by Quesnel into Victoria Harbour.
Quesnel left Esquimalt on 13 September 1942, with four other corvettes headed for Panama and the Atlantic. Transferred to the east coast to replace a ship taking part in Operation Torch, Quesnel arrived at Halifax on 13 October 1942, and was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). With the division of the force into escort groups in June 1943, she became a member of EG W-1. During this period she underwent a refit, including fo'c's'le extension, from early September to 23 December 1943, at Pictou, Nova Scotia. This refit was followed by workups in St. Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia and Bermuda.
On 12 May 1944, she picked up 17 crew members from the damaged SS Esso Pittsburgh. Quesnel later joined the Quebec Force in the St. Lawrence River on 10 June 1944, and was tasked with escorting Labrador-Quebec convoys through the ice fields in the Straits of Belle Isle.
In November 1944 she was transferred to Halifax Force, going to Sydney, Nova Scotia for refit and, on completion late in January 1945, to Bermuda for workups. She resumed escort duty late in March 1945, temporarily attached to EG W-5 and W-8 of the WLEF until the end of the war.
She brought her last convoy to Halifax in July 1945 and was decommissioned on 3 July 1945. She was the only one of the ten corvettes transferred from the Royal Navy who was not returned. She was sold on 5 October 1945, to the United Steel and Metal Company in Hamilton, Ontario for scrapping. She was finally broken up at Hamilton in 1946.
Thunderbird
During the summer of 1942, while coming through Hecate Strait in the Queen Charlottes, Quesnel sheltered from a storm in Alert Bay, British Columbia. While ashore, some crew members removed a carved Thunderbird from a local burial ground. The grave marker was for a man named Michael Dutch, from the Kwakwaka'wakw First Nation who died circa 1922. The crew members considered the totem a lucky talisman and had it depicted on the ship's badge. There are persistent rumours that the Thunderbird totem still exists and in 2007 some of the Quesnels former sailors issued a public plea for its return.

Loretta Ann P. "Etta" Rosales (born 1938) is a Filipina activist, teacher and politician who has served three terms as the party-list representative of the Akbayan Citizens' Action Party to the Philippines' House of Representatives from the 11th-14th Congress (1998-2007). She was the Chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights of the Republic of the Philippines from 2010 to 2015.
She is a well-known defender of human rights and was instrumental in instituting a class action suit in the Hawaii District Court which resulted in the only judgment holding the former dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos liable for gross human rights violations committed during his incumbency, which judgment was partially executed in 2011. She herself is a victim of human rights violations by the Marcos regime.
As an activist, she founded the leftist and now party-list Alliance of Concerned Teacher (ACT). She was also the chairperson of Partido ng Bayan. She joined Akbayan in 1998, formed the Akbayan Citizens' Action Party, better known as Akbayan. She was elected as a congresswoman for that party list from 1998 to 2007.
After serving in Congress for three terms, she served as Co-Chairperson of the Philippine Coalition for the International Criminal Court and founded Building Bridges for Peace, a multi-sectoral initiative to secure land rights and security for agrarian reform and indigenous communities through dialogue.
In 2010, she was the possible choice of President Benigno S. Aquino III to head the country's Commission on Human Rights as a replacement to Leila de Lima, who became the Justice Secretary of the country. Many left-wing organizations, such as Karapatan and the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) (a group she was formerly aligned with), protested her appointment, stating that she was unfit for the position.
Rosales is a known critic of the regime of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and has often led her party list in protests in opposition to it. Risa Hontiveros, a colleague in Akbayan, welcomed her appointment. She was appointed Commission on Human Rights Chairperson on September 1, 2010. As CHR Chairperson, she also served as Chairperson of the Southeast Asia National Human Rights Institutions Forum, the regional network of national human rights institutions in ASEAN.
In November 2017, the Germany-based Progressive Alliance cited Rosales for her contribution to human rights in the Philippines and for political courage. She was the first recipient of the award.

The Palazzo Branconio dell'Aquila is a lost palace in the rione Borgo of Rome (west of Castel Sant'Angelo), designed by Raphael for Giovanbattista Branconio dell'Aquila, a papal advisor and goldsmith.
It was designed by the Italian artist in his last years of life, around 1520. The palace lay along the Borgo Nuovo road, and was demolished around 1660 together with the adjoining block, named "Isola del Priorato" after the nearby Priory of the Knights of Rhodes, to open a square in front of Saint Peter's Square colonnade, the Piazza Rusticucci.

Robert Brown (23 March 1842 – 26 October 1895) was a British scientist, explorer, and author.
Biography
Brown was born in Camster, Caithness, and studied in the universities of Edinburgh, Leyden, Copenhagen, and Rostock.
He took the habit of referring to his home town, Campster (Campsterianus), to distinguish himself from his famous contemporary of the same name: Robert Brown of Montrose.
He visited Spitzbergen, Greenland, and the western shore of Baffin Bay while still an undergraduate, and subsequently carried on scientific investigations among the islands of the Pacific and on the Venezuelan, Alaskan, and Bering shores, leading an expedition to map the interior of Vancouver Island and writing much on the fauna and flora of those countries.
Exploration and travel
Brown arrived at Fort Victoria in early 1863 to explore the Colony of Vancouver Island. Later that year, he explored from Barkley Sound to Kyuquot. The following year he accepted the leadership of the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition, a venture which covered about 2000 km over four and a half months. The expedition named many of the mountains, rivers and lakes of Vancouver Island.; members of expedition, which included Frederick Whymper as its artist, insisted that Browns River be named after him. They found gold at the Leech River, causing much excitement, but the results were limited to $60,000. Brown attributed more importance to their discovery of coal in the Comox Valley. He took an interest in Chinook jargon.
With Edward Whymper, brother of Frederick, he attempted to penetrate the inland ice of Greenland in 1867, and made many discoveries concerning its nature which were later confirmed by Robert Peary. He traveled in the Barbary States of North Africa, and became the foremost British authority on Morocco almost by accident, having gone there for a holiday but having found himself unable to enjoy idleness.
Lecturing and writing
Before he was 30 years old Brown had written over 30 academic papers and an advanced textbook on botany, in addition to more popularising works. He wrote up his Vancouver Island travels and was awarded a doctorate based on this by the University of Rostock in 1869.
He was a lecturer on geology, botany, and zoology in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and was a member of many learned societies in England, America, and on the Continent. He was president of the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh, and a member of the council of the Royal Geographical Society.
Brown moved to London in 1876 and spent the rest of his life writing, earning his living as a journalist. In addition to botany, he also wrote prolifically on zoology, geology, and geography, for both learned and popular audiences. One example of this ability to write for generalists and specialists is the extensive commentary he contributed to an 1896 reprint of the 1807 slave narrative of John R. Jewitt, in which Brown reflects on the changes in the lives of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast from the time of the first European explorers in the late eighteenth century, to Maquinna's chiefdom and Jewitt's captivity, to his own explorations in 1863, when intertribal warfare was still rife, to the situation in the mid-1890s, by when many of the nations were on the brink of extinction.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, Brown's 1886 book Spunyarn and Spindrift, A sailor boy's log of a voyage out and home in a China tea-clipper contains the earliest known usage in print of Gadget.
Brown had been a strong, confident, fun-loving young man, but worked too hard, and was both incapable of relaxing and at the same time exhausted by London life. He grew jaded that his best work went unrecognised, and died 26 October 1895, only 53 years old, working to the night of his death as a writer. He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.
Publications
In addition to many scientific papers, articles, and reviews in various languages, his publications included:
Manual of Botany (1874)
Science for All (five volumes, 1877–82)
The World Its Cities And Peoples (volumes IV-IX, 1882–85)
Spunyarn and spindrift: a sailor boy's log of a voyage out and home in a china tea-clipper (1886)
The Story of Africa and Its Explorers (four volumes, 1892–95; new edition, 1911)
The adventures of John Jewitt : only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston during a captivity of nearly three years among the Indians of Nootka Sound in Vancouver Island (1896) reprint with notes and 30-page introduction by Robert Brown at Internet Archive.

Woiwurrung (sometimes spelt Woiwurrong, Woiworung, Wuywurung) and Taungurung (Taungurong, Daungwurrung Dhagung-wurrung, Thagungwurrung) are Aboriginal languages of the Kulin Nation of Central Victoria. Woiwurrung was spoken by the Woiwurrung and related peoples in the Yarra River (Birrarung) basin, and Taungurung by the Taungurung people north of the Great Dividing Range in the Goulburn River Valley around Mansfield, Benalla and Heathcote. They are often portrayed as distinct languages, but they were mutually intelligible. Ngurai-illamwurrung (Ngurraiillam) may have been a clan name, a dialect, or a closely related language.
Phonology
The following is the Woiwurrung dialect:
It is not clear if the two rhotics are trill and flap, or tap and approximant. Vowels in Woiwurrung are /a e i o u/.
Pronouns
In the case of the Woiwurrung pronouns, the stem seems to be the standard ngali (you and I), but the front was suffixed to wa-, so wa+ngal combines to form wangal below. In Kulin languages there is no grammatical gender.
Other vocabulary
Biik = land, country
Boorondara = shade, darkness, night (origin of the name of the City of Boroondara)
Nyilum biik = poor soil / hard land (origin of the name of Nillumbik Shire)
Wominjeka = hello / welcome (womin = come, je [dji] = asking to come, ka = purpose)
yabber = to talk (this word, with the same meaning, has made its way into informal English)
Yarra = flowing, (also means "hair"). Is thought to have mistakenly given to the Yarra River (which was actually called Birrarung by the Kulin nations) by an early settler who asked a boy what it was called, who was confused and answered "it is flowing".
Number and sign system
A numbering system was used when Wurundjeri clans sent out messengers to advise neighbouring clans of upcoming events, such as a ceremony, corroboree, a challenge to fight or Marn grook ball game. Messengers carried a message stick with markings to indicate the number and type of people involved and a prop to indicate the type of event, such as a ball for a Marn grook event. The location of meeting was spoken, but neighbouring clans might not use the same language, so a sign language was used to indicate the number of days in the future when the people should assemble. The number was indicated by pointing to a location on the body from 1 to 16. After 16, at the top of the head, the count follows the equivalent locations across the other side of the body.

History
Founded in Hong Kong in 1874, Leigh & Orange began as a company called Sharp & Danby. It took two decades and four name changes, including Danby & Leigh and Danby, Leigh & Orange, for the firm to evolve step by step, into Leigh & Orange. The company first started off by Mr Granville Sharp (1825–1899), a businessman who had been sent out to the colony of Hong Kong to open a branch of the Commercial Bank of India. The story of Granville Sharp (a distant cousin of the famous Conversation Sharp), and of his wife Matilda (in whose name Granville set up the Matilda Hospital, Hong Kong) is told in Joyce Smith's book. Having "enormous faith in the future of Hong-Kong", Granville Sharp had morphed into a major land dealer and acquired the nickname "the notorious professional philanthropist and champion land jobber". Connections were key to success. One close friend of Sharp's, Sir Paul Chater, helped support the firm with commissions. Another fellow member of the Masonic Lodge was the newly arrived William Danby (1842–1908), a qualified engineer and architect who worked as Clerk of Works in the Surveyor General's Office. By 1874 Sharp and Danby had agreed to a partnership; Sharp providing the land and Danby deciding what to build on it. Success brought growth and eventually, new partners. Mr Sharp left the firm in 1880, Robert K. Leigh joined in 1882 and Mr James Orange in 1890. The early projects helped establish a reputation for institutional or 'public' work, such as Mr Danby's design for the Clock Tower Fountain in Statue Square. When Danby left the firm in 1894, its name altered to Leigh & Orange, and then stayed that way.
During the 1890s, a period of intense construction ensued, spurred by the Praya Reclamation Scheme, which gave the city a large chunk of what is now Central's core land base between Des Voeux and Connaught roads. The architecture of the new buildings situated in this area expressed the gothic/classical style of the era, many with ground floor arcades to shelter from rain and sun. By now Leigh & Orange, encouraged by the patronage of Sir Paul Chater, was considered the prime architectural office of the colony. Where the Mandarin Oriental Hotel now stands, the firm built the Queen's Building, a large office block that solidified the firm's reputation. They then built the adjacent Prince's Building, even larger. The St. Georges Building soon followed in 1904, a steel concrete structure with iron columns and teak floors. Such are the vagaries of historical records that there are some buildings no one really knows conclusively who designed, but Leigh & Orange's early prominence in local architecture put them on shortlists for any number of the city's major works. Yet the firm has never allowed itself to become specialised in only one or two building types, even if they were exalted ones. It designed go-downs, warehouses, docks and the Star Ferry wharves, critical components of the central city in the days when those zones were generally waterfront industrial in use. The ability to move among genres helped the firm survive in tough times, and capitalise in good ones.
One of the more eclectic buildings designed by the firm was the Ohel Leah Synagogue in Robinson Road in 1901. It heralded a period of interesting projects including Marble Hall, Chater's sumptuous residence on Conduit Road, a building eventually donated to the government, later to become the colony's Admiral House. St. Andrew's Church, finished in 1906, was also commissioned of L&O by Chater.
In 1910 Leigh & Orange began work on the Hong Kong University's flagship building, the Loke Yew Hall or Main Building, an arcade and courtyard building of brick and stone in the colonial style. It was to be the start of another long relationship that saw the architects design many more campus buildings, including professors' residences, the sports grounds and the staff Common Room Building. In 1919, the firm built the School of Tropical Medicine and Pathology (demolished in 1977), and in 1932 the Fung Ping Shan Library Building, which is now housing the University Museum and Art Gallery. Recently, they have completed the Pauline Chan Amenities Building, staff quarters, the Animal House & Dentistry Accommodation, swimming pools and sports grounds. Awards have been received for the Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building at the university.
Other surviving early 20th century works by the firm include the Chinese YMCA on Bridges Street and the landmark Helena May Institute (attributed), opened in 1916 as a residence for single women in the colony. During the following decades, the firm's fortunes rose and dipped along with those of the territory, affected by wars, occupation and reconstruction. Project types ranged from high-end residences to industrial storage buildings and everything in between, including more churches such as the Methodist Church in Wanchai (1955) and the Union Church in Kennedy Road (1949). Francis Howorth, a partner at L&O from 1954 designed the local landmark Mandarin Oriental Hotel, which replaced the old Queen's Building in Central.
In 1950, L&O completed the new Masonic headquarters, Zetland Hall on Kennedy Road, and Edinburgh House (now the site of Edinburgh Tower and York House) for Hongkong Land Investment Co. Schools appeared in the log books of the company in a big way in 1954, when the Seven Year Plan for expanding primary school places was accepted by the Executive Council of Hong Kong, with the target to create 26,000 additional places each year. L&O designed the Sai Ying Poon School and the North Point Primary School. The Saint Francis School for the Canossian Mission soon followed, then a new wing for the Saint Mary's School in Austen Road, Kowloon. 1954 marked the company's commissioning for the new Jockey Club building in Happy Valley, which had to be constructed at a frantic pace to fit into the racing season. The building's superstructure was erected at the rate of one floor every eight days, and followed the design of the grandstand at Bangkok. Both buildings were judged highly successful.
The 'modern' era was a busy one for the firm, with projects ranging across the programmatic map, and the geographical one. Many modern landmark buildings were constructed, and a new direction – or literally many directions – marked the firm's growth. In 1990, Leigh & Orange established their Bangkok office. Since then it has opened offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Yangon. This new regionalism has provided the firm with a plethora of opportunities and commissions across Asia and across programme types. Meanwhile, projects such as Ocean Park, Tuen Mun Hospital and Gaia restaurant, all in Hong Kong, widened the firm's reference base. L&O has landed multiple sports buildings in the Middle East, and large scale residential and office projects in mainland China. There are also more occasional briefs, such as the Integer Pavilion, an environmental experiment set up on the waterfront Tamar site. In 2009: a huge addition of buildings to the Hong Kong Science Park, in its Phase 2.
The firm enjoys long standing working relationships with clients such as the Hong Kong Electric Company and the Hong Kong Jockey Club.
Directors
Robert Leigh retired from the firm in 1904 and James Orange in 1908. Since then, there have been a total of 23 other directors (currently there are five), but the masthead name never changed.

Susan Marie Beschta (April 21, 1952 – May 2, 2019), who performed as Susan Springfield, was the founder and lead singer of Erasers, a band that headlined at CBGB in the 1970s.
She became a solo artist in the 1980s and then trained as a lawyer to start a new career. After graduating from the CUNY School of Law, she fought human rights cases for Catholic Charities. She was sworn in as a federal judge in 2018.
Early life and education
She was born Susan Marie Beschta on April 21, 1952 in Appleton, Wisconsin – one of five children of a Catholic couple, Gerald and Jean Beschta. The culture was traditional and her father was keen on sports but, while she was fond of the place, she chose a different path. After college at University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, she went to the hippy scene of California and then hitch-hiked across the country to study fine arts at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn where she hoped to become a painter.
Art and music
Beschta was able to stay rent-free at the Fine Arts Building at 232 East 59th Street in return for looking after its photo gallery. She shared a loft with Jane Fire and they formed Erasers, a punk-rock band, in 1974, with Fire on drums and Beschta as the singer/songwriter and guitarist. Several musicians such as Richie Lure and Anton Fig tried out with the band and the most lasting were Jody Beach on bass guitar and David Ebony, a classically-trained musician. The band practised in the basement of a deli near the Fine Arts Building and they played some impromptu gigs in the street there. They performed at venues including The Great Gildersleeve's and, most especially, CBGB, which was a famous proving ground for punk rock bands. Their style was enthusiastic, feminist and non-commercial. They attracted some favourable reviews but did not sign with a record label.
Beschta was influential in the social scene of punk rock, entertaining stars like Johnny Rotten and Iggy Pop and dating Richard Hell. In 1978, she starred with Debbie Harry in Amos Poe's movie The Foreigner. After the Erasers, she performed in other bands and artistic projects including the Susan Springfield Band, Desire and Civilization and the Landscape of Discontent.
Legal career
In the 1980s she trained as a lawyer to start a new career. After graduating from the CUNY School of Law, she fought human rights cases for Catholic Charities. In 2002, she joined the Department of Homeland Security to handle immigration cases in New York while still volunteering for causes including ACT UP and Code Pink. In 2018, she was sworn in as an immigration judge.
Death
Beschta died on May 2, 2019, at the age of 67 in hospice care in Manhattan, New York City, of brain cancer.

Zechariah 2 is the second of the total 14 chapters in the Book of Zechariah in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet Zechariah, and is a part of the Book of the Twelve Minor Prophets. This chapter is a part of a section (so-called "First Zechariah") consisting of Zechariah 1–8. It records the third of eight visions received by the prophet (verses 1–5), followed by an oracle calling the exiles to return to the city where Yahweh is about to dwell and all nations will come (verses 6–13).
Text
The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 13 verses in English Bibles. Hebrew Bible uses different "verse numbering" (see below).
Verse numbering
There are some differences in verse numbering of this chapter in English Bibles and Hebrew texts:
This article generally follows the common numbering in Christian English Bible versions, with notes to the numbering in Hebrew Bible versions.
Textual witnesses
Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Codex Cairensis (from year 895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), and Codex Leningradensis (1008).
Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, 4Q80 (4QXIIe; 75–50 BCE) with extant verses 6–10 (verses 10–14 in Masoretic verse numbering).
There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; B; 4th century), Codex Sinaiticus (S; BHK: S; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; Q; 6th century). Some fragments containing parts of this chapter (a revision of the Septuagint) were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, i.e., Naḥal Ḥever 8Ḥev1 (8ḤevXIIgr); late 1st century BCE) with extant verses 3-5, 7-8, 12-13 (verses 7–9, 11–12, 16–17 in Masoretic verse numbering).
Vision of the measuring line (2:1–5; Hebrew 2:5–9)
This section records Zechariah's third of eight visions which describes the 'unlimited size of the restored city (cf. ) assuring the people that God's glory will be in there (cf. ; ) and God will protect them like in the past ().
Future joy of Zion and many nations (2:6–13; Hebrew 2:10–17)
The oracle in this part urges the exiles who are still in Babylon to return to Zion, for God will dwell in that city and other nations will come.
Verse 10
Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion:
for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee,
saith the Lord.
"Lo, I come": Septuagint: ; in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus Christ is called , "he who comes" ().
"Dwell in the midst of thee": alluded in the Gospel of John: "The Word was made Flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14) and in the Book of Revelation: "Behold the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them and shall be their God" (Revelation 21:3). Thus, it refers primarily at Messiah's first advent (; John 1:14; ; ); yet more fully at the second advent (; cf. Zechariah 9:9, ; ; ). God dwells spiritually in his people (), alluding the constant presence of Jesus Christ in his churches.
Verse 11
And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day,
and shall be my people:
and I will dwell in the midst of thee,
and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
"Many nations shall be joined to the Lord": ("shall be joined" = "shall join themselves"); "shall fly for refuge unto the Lord" (Septuagint); "cleaving to Him by a close union". Isaiah speaks about 'single proselytes' in , whereas Jeremiah uses 'the word of Israel's self-exhortation' when they return from Babylon, that "going and weeping," they shall go and seek the Lord their God, saying, "Come and let us join ourselves unto the Lord, in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten" .
"My people": or "unto me for a people"; Septuagint: "shall be unto him for a people" (cf. ). Many nations who will become "the Lord's people" share that title with people of Israel (cf. ; ; ; ),
"Sent me unto thee": an addition of "unto thee" to the same formula (). Here YHWH first says, "I will dwell," then says that YHWH "sent", thus, 'YHWH the Sender and YHWH the Sent must be One'

Commander Henry Alexander Stuart-Menteth, (26 August 1912 – 14 May 2000) was a British naval officer famous for his service in the Royal Navy, particularly during the Second World War where he assisted in the sinking of two U-boats and helped capture Enigma code fragments, which enabled Bletchley Park to decipher the code. He commanded six ships during his career. He married in 1952, having two sons and a daughter, and seven grandchildren in turn.
Stuart-Menteth was born as one of four. He joined a navy cadet force in Devon, serving on several ships. After his promotion course, he served both abroad and in the United Kingdom. He joined shortly before the Second World War. His ship was torpedoed after a raid on a German-held port in April 1940. He was kept in a hospital by the Germans, and was listed at home as killed in action. When the British liberated the area, he was freed. On his next ship, , he helped capture Enigma code fragments, which enabled Bletchley Park to decipher the code. In the same year he was given his first command, . He was mentioned in despatches in 1942, while working on after the ship sunk a U-boat, and a Distinguished Service Cross for sinking another U-boat. Stuart-Menteth was entrusted to the Royal Australian Navy in 1949, where he commanded two destroyers. He ran the Scottish Corps of Commissionaires for 20 years after his 1958 retirement.
Early life
Henry Alexander Stuart-Menteth, often abbreviated to Alex Stuart-Menteth, was born on 26 August 1912 in Merstham, Surrey. He was the son of Walter Stuart-Menteth and Violet Stuart-Menteth (née Lafone), one of four: Walter Granville Stuart-Menteth (1906 – 1970), Frances Bevyl Stuart-Menteth (1907 – 1957), and Lucy Violet Stuart-Menteth (1911 – ). In 1926, he became a cadet in Dartmouth, Devon. With the cadets, he served on the ships in the Atlantic, in the West Indies and America, and on the shore establishment HMS President on his promotion course.
Naval career
Alex Stuart-Menteth served on the destroyers in the Mediterranean in 1934 and 1935, in the home fleet in 1935 and 1936, the minesweeper in the reserve fleet in 1935, and in 1935 serving in China.
Second World War
On 28 August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Stuart-Menteth joined the destroyer . Hunter was in Captain Bernard Warburton-Lee's 2nd Flotilla, along with four other destroyers. On 10 April 1940, in a snowstorm, the Flotilla attacked the port of Narvik, held by the Germans. Four German destroyers were sunk and seven damaged, notably sinking , an 8,500-ton ship transporting ammunition. Hunter was set alight and torpedoed, leading to her sinking. As she sank, Stuart-Menteth was trapped by a malfunctioning davit with a leg wound on the upper deck. A rating saved Stuart-Menteth, and they were both picked up by German sailors.
Stuart-Menteth was taken to Narvik, at a civilian hospital. He remained in the town until its eventual liberation by the Allies. However, whilst he was in hospital, Stuart-Menteth was listed as killed in action, and had an obituary in The Times as such, which he later read. After further hospitalisation in Britain from April to December 1940, on 3 December Stuart-Menteth became the first lieutenant of the Tribal-class destroyer . She partook in Operation Claymore, an operation to disrupt supplies, to ferry commandoes to shore, and to capture German code. Somalia brought to a stop Krebs, a German trawler, by firing at her, forcing her to stop. A boarding party found cryptographic keys and rotor machines. This assisted Bletchley Park to decipher several Enigma codes.
In May 1941, Stuart-Menteth again assisted the capture of Enigma material from the German ship München, enabling Bletchley Park to begin to decipher German Enigma codes. Several months later, he was given command of his first ship, , a Hunt-class destroyer. Stuart-Menteth joined in March 1942, and helped sink the . He was mentioned in despatches on 2 June 1943 as "Lieutenant-Commander Henry Alexander Stuart-Menteth, Royal Navy"; after commanding Aldenham in a disastrous mission in the Aegean Sea. In late 1943, Stuart-Menteth took command of , and partook in training officers of landing craft. His last command in the war was , with which he assisted in the sinking of , for which he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross.
After the war
After World War II on 13 February 1946 Stuart-Menteth became first lieutenant on , followed by on 4 September 1946, before being entrusted to the Royal Australian Navy in 1949. There he commanded his last two ships, the destroyers and . He went on to work with Lord Mountbatten in Malta, and in 1958 he retired, moving to Scotland. He did, however, operate the Scottish Corps of Commissionaires for close to 20 years, and was chairman of the Edinburgh World Wildlife Fund for 10 years.
Personal life
Stuart-Menteth met Penelope Giles in 1952 in Australia, the couple married, having a daughter and two sons: Andrew Alexander (1954), Walter Henry (1957), and Harriet Lucy (1959); and seven grandchildren. He died on 14 May 2000 in Edinburgh, Lothian.

An Experiment in Criticism is a 1961 book by C. S. Lewis in which he proposes that the quality of books should be measured not by how they are written, but by how they are read. To do this, the author describes two kinds of readers. One is what he calls the "unliterary", and the other the "literary". He proceeds to outline some of the differences between these two types of readers. For example, one characterization of a unliterary reader is that the argument "I've read it before" is a conclusive reason not to read a book. In contrast, literary readers reread books many times, savouring certain passages, and attempting to glean more from subsequent readings.
Lewis also argued that judging books by whether they are "lowbrow" or "highbrow" is not necessarily fruitful; many "lowbrow" books prove to be valuable to a literary reader willing to approach without prejudgment. He noted that books classified as "lowbrow", such as science fiction, are also capable of inducing a passion to re-read and imparting experience which changes reader's worldview. Lewis suggests that books which are capable of doing this may prove to have enduring merit regardless of their genre of origin. He suggested that attempting to judge the literary merit of books based on traditional criteria may not prove fruitful.
Thus Lewis suggests that a "quality book" may be defined as one that someone – anyone – will re-read. Some such books will be judged by "highbrow" readers as being of poor quality; this view is deficient in that it has failed to appreciate those qualities which have merited re-reading.

Geography
The Liverpool Plains have a generally flat to undulating terrain formed from the remnants of old volcanoes such as that of the Liverpool Ranges to the southwest. To the south and east, it merges into the higher and cooler Northern Tablelands.
The Liverpool Plains is generally regarded as the richest agricultural region in Australia owing to its rich black soils, which originally supported a mixed grassland vegetation containing both annual and perennial grasses, which early in the region's history were used to feed cattle and sheep.
Wheat and cotton are the chief crops, although production fluctuates wildly according to rainfall and soil erosion is a major problem occurring both after droughts and floods. The climate is hot in summer, mild in winter, and of moderate rainfall. The average is generally around with a slight summer maximum, but is quite erratic and can vary from in very wet years to as little as . Temperatures in summer frequently exceed and make cropping without irrigation risky without sophisticated meteorological forecasting techniques.

"Ghost of You and Me" is a 2001 single by British pop band BBMak. It appears on BBMak's debut studio album, Sooner or Later. The song peaked at number 8 on the US Adult Contemporary chart. It was written by Jon Lind and Richard Page (former vocalist of Mr. Mister). The song was covered in Australia by Rick Price for his album Another Place.
Background
"Ghost of You and Me" was originally recorded by Curtis Stigers for his 1995 album Time Was. Jon Lind played the demo for BBMak member Mark Barry when the band was recording in Los Angeles. Barry brought the demo to his band mates and they agreed to record it, with Barry saying, "When we recorded it we were so pleased at how it turned out to be. We had a full orchestra on the track,. It sounds big, its a big epic ballad. It's one of those songs you know when you hear it you fall in love with it. So from our reaction as well we were very confident it would be hit".
Music and lyrics
The song is a ballad and has a tempo of 200 beats per minute. Chuck Taylor of Billboard wrote the song has "a vivid lyric characterizing one's reluctance to give up on a loved one, alongside a bounty of percussive brush strokes, piano, a guitar, and even a weeping cello".
Music video
The music video was directed by Nigel Dick and shot in Puerto Rico. Mark Barry, Christian Burns, and Stephen McNally sing and play guitar on the beach and walk through the streets. They are each haunted by visions of their respective ex-lovers. Later, the men sing on an outdoor stage, flanked by violin players. The women in the visions multiply into many more "ghosts", and a final aerial shot shows the group of women walking on the island, wearing white and carrying candles. The video became a mainstay on the MTV show TRL.

George Bouzianis (; ; November 8, 1885 – October 23, 1959) was a major Greek expressionist painter.
Biography
He studied painting at the Athens School of Fine Arts with teachers such as Nikiphoros Lytras and Konstantinos Volanakis, Georgios Roilos and Dimitrios Geraniotis. In 1907 he moved to Munich to continue his art studies with Otto Seitz. In 1910 he moved to Berlin, where he was taught from Max Liebermann. In 1917 he has already adopted elements of German expressionism movement in his own individual artistic style. He became very soon a respected artist in Germany and very soon he had his first contract with the Barhfeld gallery. In 1927 in Chemnitz there was a large exhibition of his work. Between 1929 and 1932 he travelled and lived in Paris with the financial support of the Barhfeld gallery. Due to the financial crisis across Europe he had to return to Eichenau near Munich, where he had built a house. Unfortunately, expressionism was gradually fading away in Germany with the rise of nazism in Germany's politics.
In 1934 he returned to Greece. To his own disappointment he failed to take a position at the School of Fine Arts of Athens. Initially, Bouzianis was treated with hostility from the Athenian artistic circles who started to appreciate his oeuvre after his exhibition at Parnassos gallery in 1949.
In 1950 he represented Greece at the Venice Biennale and in 1952 he was awarded with the first award of the Guggenheim competition for Greece.
His house after his death in Dafni, Attica has been converted to a museum. His paintings are today exhibited at the National Gallery of Athens and in many other museums in Greece and abroad.

The white-browed tit (Poecile superciliosus, formerly Parus superciliosus) is a species of bird in the tit family Paridae. It is endemic to the mountain forests of central China and Tibet.
It is 13.5–14 cm long, with a weight of 10–12 g. The plumage pattern is very similar to that of the western North American mountain chickadee P. gambeli (of which it has on occasion been considered a subspecies, despite its being on a different continent), differing in the breast and cheeks being rusty brown, not white, and having a longer and more sharply defined white eyebrow; the back is also a richer brown, not greyish-brown (del Hoyo et al. 2007).
It breeds in alpine shrub forests of Berberis, Rhamnus, Rhododendron, and Salix at 3,200–4,235 m altitude, descending in winter to slightly lower levels where it occurs in coniferous forests, primarily Picea. It nests on the ground in rock crevices or old rodent burrows (del Hoyo et al. 2007).
Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the white-browed tit is sister to the sombre tit (Poecile lugubris).

The Sea Urchins were an indie pop band from West Bromwich, England formed in 1986. They were the first band to release a single on Sarah Records.
History
The initial line-up was James Roberts (vocals), Simon Woodcock (guitar), Robert Cooksey (guitar), Mark Bevin (bass), Bridget Duffy (tambourine, organ), and Patrick Roberts (drums). Their first two releases were flexi discs given away with fanzines in 1987. Bevin left, to be replaced by Darren Martin. Their "Pristine Christine" single was the first Sarah Records release, and is highly coveted among vinyl record collectors. With the following year's double-A-side "Solace"/"Please Rain Fall" they began to show more mod-rock influences. Both singles were successful in indie terms, but Sarah Records were unwilling to commit to an album, and Duffy and Martin left. Woodcock took over on bass, with James Roberts adding guitar. The band released one more single for Sarah ("A Morning Oddyssey" in 1990), but disagreements about the next single saw them move on to Cheree Records, who issued "Please Don't Cry" in 1991. The band split up in summer 1991. Two albums were subsequently released; Sarah Records issued a compilation of the band's material for the label, including the flexi-disc tracks, as Stardust in 1992, while Fierce Recordings issued a live album in 1994.
James Roberts, Cooksey, and Woodcock later formed the band Delta. James Roberts, Patrick Roberts, and Robert Cooksey also formed The Low Scene.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Elmslie represented the gold medal-winning Australia team (with Cate Campbell, Alicia Coutts and Melanie Schlanger in the final) of the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay, where the team set a then-Olympic Record of 3:33.15. Elmslie also won two silvers, as part of the Australian teams in the competitive heats of both the 4 × 100 metre medley relay and the 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay.
At the 2013 Australian Swimming Championships she won silver in the 100-metre butterfly and bronze 50-metre freestyle events, qualifying for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships. At the World Championships, she teamed up with Bronte Campbell, Emma McKeon and Emily Seebohm in the heats of the 4×100-metre freestyle relay, finishing second in their heat and overall. In the final sisters Cate and Bronte Campbell, Emma McKeon and Alicia Coutts won the silver medal, finishing 0.12 of a second behind the United States team.
At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Elmslie represented the gold medal-winning Australia team (with sisters Cate Campbell and Bronte Campbell and Emma McKeon in the final, along with Madison Wilson in the heats) of the 4 × 100 metre freestyle relay. In the final of the event, the Australian team set a then 4 × 100 metres freestyle relay World Record time of 3:30.65. Elmslie also won silver as part of the Australian team in the competitive heats of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay.
Elmslie did not qualify for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. On April 23, 2019, Elmslie announced her retirement from competitive swimming, on her personal Instagram page, at the age of 24.

Polymethylpentene (PMP), also known as poly(4-methyl-1-pentene), is a thermoplastic polyolefin. It is used for gas-permeable packaging, autoclavable medical and laboratory equipment, microwave components, and cookware. It is commonly called TPX, which is a trademark of Mitsui Chemicals.
Production
Polymethylpentene is a 4-methyl-1-pentene-derived linear isotactic polyolefin and is made by Ziegler–Natta type catalysis. The commercially available grades are usually copolymers. It can be extruded and moulded (by injection moulding or blow moulding).
Physical properties
Polymethylpentene melts at ≈ 235 °C. It has a relatively low density (0.84 g/cm3) among plastics and is transparent. It has low moisture absorption, and exceptional acoustical and electrical properties. Its properties are reasonably similar to those of other polyolefins, although it is more brittle and more gas permeable. The polymer also has a high thermal stability, excellent dielectric characteristics and a high chemical resistance. The crystalline phase has a lower density than the amorphous phase.
In comparison to other materials being used for operating in THz range, TPX shows excellent optical properties with a wavelength independent refractive index of 1.460±0.005 between visible light and 100~GHz.
Applications
Applications include sonar covers, speaker cones, ultrasonic transducer heads, and lightweight structural parts. It is also FDA compliant for use in food processing machinery. Polymethylpentene is often used in films and coatings for gas-permeable packaging.
Because of its high melting point and good temperature stability, polymethylpentene is used for autoclavable medical and laboratory equipment, microwave components, and cookware.
It is also often used in electrical components e.g. LED molds because it is an excellent electrical insulator.
TPX is a hard, solid material, which can be mechanically shaped into various optical components like lenses and windows. It is used in CO2 laser pumped molecular lasers as an output window because it is transparent in the whole terahertz range and totally suppresses the ~10 μm pump radiation.

The Country Club is an off-Broadway play written by Douglas Carter Beane.
Plot
The play is set in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, in the womblike cub room of the local Country Club. Six insular friends (and one outsider)
are shown over a year of holiday-themed parties where drinks are bolted and truths are spewed.
Soos, a young, witty, charming neurotic, retreats to her upper-class hometown in the aftermath of a failed marriage. The type of WASP domain with houses “that made Martha Stewart forget she was Polish.” As party after party unfolds, the getaway weekend gives way to a year, and ultimately the rest of her life.
Brittle conversation is bandied about, and Soos is reunited with her onetime boyfriend, the charming Zip (Played by Jared Kressman). She also returns to her circles of old friends: the highly strung party planner Froggy and her starchy husband Bri; the wry and sarcastic Pooker; the alcoholic good ol' boy Hutch. But cracks soon begin to show in the facade. Soos falls in and out of an easy relationship with Zip, as he starts an affair with Chloe, a working-class Roman Catholic girl from Philadelphia (who is also engaged to Hutch). Hutch is portrayed by Jackson Smith. In a production of "The Country Club" by a random Temple acting class, critics would call the performance "distracting" and "A train wreck I wish I died in".
Lives are casually destroyed, lives careen onward, and through it all tragedies are endured without ever being mentioned. As Pooker observes between cocktail sips, "We all have our little stories and nobody brings them up. That's what's known as community spirit."
Productions
The play was presented Off-Broadway by the Drama Dept. at the Greenwich House Theater, running from September 14, 1999 to December 18, 1999. The production received 2000 Drama Desk Award nominations for Outstanding Costume Design and Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play (Sedaris).
The play had "small productions" at the Dorset Theater Festival (Vermont) and Mojo Ensemble (Los Angeles) prior to the production at the
Long Wharf Theatre. The play premiered at the Long Wharf Theatre, New Haven, Connecticut in January 1998.

Elmer H. Baumann (born February 15, 1902) was an American electrician from Milwaukee who served one term (1927–1928) as a Socialist member of the Wisconsin State Assembly representing Milwaukee County's 11th Assembly district (the 11th and 24th wards of the City of Milwaukee).
Background
He was born February 15, 1902, in Milwaukee and was educated in public grade schools. He became an electrician and a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, served as assistant business agent of his local union in 1925, and as a delegate to the 1925 international convention of the IBEW in Seattle, Washington. He held various offices in the Milwaukee labor movement. and at the time of his election was vice-president of IBEW Local 494.
In the Assembly
He had never held public office until his successful 1926 bid for the Assembly to replace fellow Socialist Olaf C. Olsen. Due to the failure of his only opponent to complete necessary paperwork, he ran unopposed (one of three Socialists to run unopposed in the 1926 election). He was assigned to the Assembly's standing committee on education.
He was defeated in his 1928 bid for re-election by Republican Alex Chmurski, who polled 3358 votes to 3056 for Democrat George Brier and 2989 for Baumann.
After the Assembly
He served for some time on the Milwaukee Board of School Directors, and died in March 1935 while seeking re-election to that office, in which he was seen as a strong advocate for higher pay for teachers and educational staff.

William Westley Richards (24 November 1789 – 11 September 1865) was a British firearms manufacturer and founder of Westley Richards.
Richards was born in Birmingham, Warwickshire, England to Theophilus Richards and Mary Bingham.
He married his first wife, Ann Barlow in 1813. They had six children: Westley, Emma, Caroline, Edward Harding, Ellen, and Mary Anne. William and Ann divorced before 1823. He married his second wife, Harriett Seale (1793–1865) on 18 January 1823 at St Pancras Old Church, London. He had three children by his second marriage, Charles, George Seale, and William.
William died 11 September 1865 at Hall Hill, Edgbaston, Warwickshire.
In 1812, at the age of 22, he established the Westley Richards gunmaking business in Birmingham, which still bears his name. His family background had been in fine jewellery, cutlery and the gun trade. He coined the motto, "to be the maker of as good a gun as can be made" which is still used.
Richards was an innovator, creating a number of gun-related patents. The most significant were the patent relating to the use of a new waterproof primer for the ignition of percussion guns and also the first flip-up sight, which went on to be used by the British Army. Richards opened a gun store in London in 1815 on New Bond Street. The store was owned and managed by William Bishop, known as the Bishop of Bond Street.
Control of the gunsmith company was inherited by Westley Richards, the eldest son of the founder. Richards carried on in a similar vein to his father, innovating various guns and registering patents.

Launceston Elliot (9 June 1874 – 8 August 1930) was a Scottish weightlifter, and the first British Olympic champion.
Biography
Launceston Elliot was conceived in Launceston, Tasmania, Australia, after which he was named, but before his birth his family moved to India and he was born in Kaladagi and baptised at Guledgudd, now in Karnataka State. His family was an established part of the Scottish aristocracy with Lord Minto being head of the family which had strong connections with India. The 4th Earl Minto served as Viceroy of India (1905–10). Launceston Elliot was the grandson of Sir Charles Elliot, the onetime governor of Saint Helena, and his father Gilbert Wray Elliot served as magistrate with the Indian Civil Service.
In 1887, Elliot's father gave up his post in India and took his family to England where he began farming in Essex. The 13-year-old Launceston, an exceptionally well-built youth, who was seeing England for the first time, immediately came under the influence of the great Eugen Sandow and soon developed into an unusually talented lifter. In January 1891, aged only 16, he performed creditably at what is now recognised as the first British Championships held at the fashionable Café Monico in Piccadilly, London. Three years later he was the winner of the championships at the Royal Aquarium, Westminster.
Continuing success encouraged the 21-year-old Elliot to travel to Athens for the first modern Olympic Games. At the time, there were no internationally accepted rules or classifications for weightlifting and the 1896 Olympics added further to the huge variety of classes contested on the contemporary scene. The two-handed lift came first on the program and, after a long drawn out contest, Viggo Jensen of Denmark and Elliot had both lifted 111.5 kilograms, but Prince George awarded the Dane first place for having done so in better style. Jensen's lift was accomplished with a superb clean lift whereas Elliot had certainly encountered difficulty. By contrast, the one-handed event was a short, sharp event. Elliot declined Prince George's courteous offer of a rest break but he asked that he might this time lift after Jensen, as in the two-handed event the Dane had the advantage of lifting after Elliot. The request was granted although the order of lifting was not to have a material effect on the result. Elliot raised 71.0 kilograms without difficulty whereas Jensen, who had injured his shoulder trying to raise 112.5 kilograms in the two-handed event, could only manage 57.0 kilograms and Britain's first Olympic champion was crowned.
Elliot also competed in the 100 metres in the athletics programme. He placed third in his heat and did not advance to the final. In the wrestling event, Elliot was defeated in the first round by Carl Schuhmann of Germany, the gymnastics champion.
He finished last of the five competitors in the rope climbing event on the gymnastics program.
Following his victory in Athens, he set four new records at the 1899 Amateur Championships and, as a prominent figure on the British weightlifting scene, his financial success was virtually assured. He also competed at the 1900 Summer Olympics, throwing the discus and placing eleventh (no weightlifting events were held that year). In 1903 he turned professional. After his retirement Elliot carried on farming in England for a few years before settling in Melbourne in 1923. He died of cancer of the spine on 8 August 1930 aged 56 and is buried in Melbourne's Fawkner Cemetery.
Photographs of Launceston Elliot are featured among the distinguished Scottish athletes in the sport section of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh (re-opened after a major refurbishment in 2011).

John Calvin Coolidge Sr. (March 31, 1845 – March 18, 1926) was an American politician and businessman from Vermont, and the father of Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States. The senior Coolidge administered the presidential oath of office to his son at their family homestead in the early morning hours of August 3, 1923, following the death of President Warren G. Harding.
Born in Plymouth, Vermont, John C. Coolidge was a farmer and store owner, and worked at a variety of other occupations, including banker and insurance broker. In addition, he was a veteran of the Vermont militia, and held the law enforcement posts of town constable and county deputy sheriff. A prominent local leader, he served in numerous Plymouth town offices, and was elected to terms in both the Vermont House of Representatives and Vermont Senate.
John C. Coolidge remained active in his farming and business interests until his death in Plymouth in 1926; he was buried in Plymouth Notch at a village cemetery where several generations of his family are also buried.
Political and business career
Coolidge was born in Plymouth, Vermont on March 31, 1845, the son of Calvin Galusha Coolidge and Sarah Coolidge. Calvin G. Coolidge was a farmer, and also served in the Vermont House of Representatives. John Coolidge graduated from Black River Academy, and served in Vermont during the American Civil War as commander of the state militia's Company K, 10th Regiment with the rank of captain.
Early in his life, Coolidge worked as a woodcutter and wheelwright. He was later active in several occupations; a partial list includes farmer, blacksmith, bricklayer, mason, carriage maker, harness maker, teacher, store owner, and insurance broker. In addition, he was a vice president of the Ludlow Savings Bank & Trust Company, and was appointed to its board of directors. Coolidge also served on the Black River Academy board of trustees.
A Republican, Coolidge served in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1872 to 1878. He held local offices throughout his life, including town selectboard member, town meeting moderator, town agent, tax collector, road commissioner, school superintendent, justice of the peace, and notary public. For several years, he was Plymouth's assistant postmaster, with a long running joke in the town being that Coolidge held this position because he was the only person in Plymouth who knew how to complete the forms required when submitting the post office's annual report to the main office in Washington, DC. For nearly 40 years he was both a town constable and deputy sheriff of Windsor County.
During the 1900 to 1902 governorship of William W. Stickney, who was related to the Coolidge family, John Coolidge served on his military staff as aide-de-camp with the rank of colonel.
Coolidge served in the Vermont Senate from 1910 to 1912. During his Senate term, Coolidge was chairman of the Committee on Land Taxes.
Inaugurating his son
Upon hearing the death of President Warren G. Harding the previous day, Coolidge, who was a Vermont justice of the peace and a notary public, administered the presidential oath of office to his son at the Coolidge Homestead in Plymouth Notch, Vermont, at about 2:30 a.m. on August 3, 1923.
Death
John Calvin Coolidge Sr. died in Plymouth, Vermont on , thirteen days before his 81st birthday. He was buried at Plymouth Notch Cemetery.
Family
In 1868, Coolidge married Victoria Josephine Moor (born 1846). They were the parents of two children, son Calvin, and daughter Abigail (1875–1890). Victoria died in 1885, aged 39.
Coolidge married Caroline Athelia Brown (1857–1920) on September 9, 1891.

In mathematics, the incompressibility method is a proof method like the probabilistic method, the counting method or the pigeonhole principle. To prove that an object in a certain class (on average) satisfies a certain property, select an object of that class which is incompressible. If it does not satisfy the property, it can be compressed by computable coding. Since it can be generally proven that almost all objects in a given class are incompressible, the argument demonstrates that almost all objects in the class have the property involved (not just the average). To select an incompressible object is ineffective, and cannot be done by a computer program. However, a simple counting argument usually shows that almost all objects of a given class can be compressed by only a few bits (are incompressible).
History
The incompressibity method depends on an objective, fixed notion of incompressibility. Such a notion was provided by the Kolmogorov complexity theory, named for Andrey Kolmogorov.
One of the first uses of the incompressibility method with Kolmogorov complexity in theory of computation was to prove that the running time of a one-tape Turing machine is quadratic for accepting a palindromic language and sorting algorithms require at least time to sort items. One of the early influential papers using the incompressibility method was published in 1980. The method was applied to a number of fields, and its name was coined in a textbook.
Applications
Number theory
According to an elegant Euclidian proof, there is an infinite number of prime numbers. Bernhard Riemann demonstrated that the number of primes less than a given number is connected with the 0s of the Riemann zeta function. Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vallée-Poussin proved in 1896 that this
number of primes is asymptotic to ; see Prime number theorem (use for the natural logarithm an for the binary logarithm). Using the incompressibility method, G. J. Chaitin argued as follows: Each can be described by its prime factorization (which is unique), where are the first primes which are (at most) and the exponents (possibly) 0. Each exponent is (at most) , and can be described by bits. The description of can be given in bits, provided we know the value of (enabling one to parse the consecutive blocks of exponents). To describe requires only bits. Using the incompressibility of most positive integers, for each there is a positive integer of binary length which cannot be described in fewer than bits. This shows that the number of primes, less than , satisfies
A more-sophisticated approach attributed to Piotr Berman (present proof partially by John Tromp) describes every incompressible by and , where is the largest prime number dividing . Since it is incompressible, the length of this description must exceed . To parse the first block of the description must be given in prefix form , where is an arbitrary, small, positive function. Therefore, . Hence, with for a special sequence of values . This shows that the expression below holds for this special sequence, and a simple extension shows that it holds for every :
Both proofs are presented in more detail.
Graph theory
A labeled graph with nodes can be represented by a string of bits, where each bit indicates the presence (or absence) of an edge between the pair of nodes in that position. , and the degree of each vertex satisfies
To prove this by the incompressibity method, if the deviation is larger we can compress the description of below ; this provides the required contradiction. This theorem is required in a more complicated proof, where the incompressibility argument is used a number of times to show that the number of unlabeled graphs is
Combinatorics
A transitive tournament is a complete directed graph, ; if , . Consider the set of all transitive tournaments on nodes. Since a tournament is a labeled, directed complete graph, it can be encoded by a string of bits where each bit indicates the direction of the edge between the pair of nodes in that position. Using this encoding, every transitive tournament contains a transitive subtournament on (at least) vertices with
This was shown as the first problem. It is easily solved by the incompressibility method, as are the coin-weighing problem, the number of covering families and expected properties; for example, at least a fraction of of all transitive tournaments on vertices have transitive subtournaments on not more than vertices. is large enough.
If a number of events are independent (in probability theory) of one another, the probability that none of the events occur can be easily calculated. If the events are dependent, the problem becomes difficult. Lovász local lemma is a principle that if events are mostly independent of one another and have an individually-small probability, there is a positive probability that none of them will occur. It was proven by the incompressibility method. Using the incompressibility method, several versions of expanders and superconcentrator graphs were shown to exist.
Topological combinatorics
In the Heilbronn triangle problem, throw points in the unit square and determine the maximum of the minimal area of a triangle formed by three of the points over all possible arrangements. This problem was solved for small arrangements, and much work was done on asymptotic expression as a function of . The original conjecture of Heilbronn was during the early 1950s. Paul Erdős proved that this bound is correct for , a prime number. The general problem remains unsolved, apart from the best-known lower bound (achievable; hence, Heilbronn's conjecture is not correct for general ) and upper bound (proven by Komlos, Pintsz and Szemeredi in 1982 and 1981, respectively). Using the incompressibility method, the average case was studied. It was proven that if the area is too small (or large) it can be compressed below the Kolmogorov complexity of a uniformly-random arrangement (high Kolmogorov complexity). This proves that for the overwhelming majority of the arrangements (and the expectation), the area of the smallest triangle formed by three of points thrown uniformly at random in the unit square is . In this case, the incompressibility method proves the lower and upper bounds of the property involved.
Probability
The law of the iterated logarithm, the law of large numbers and the recurrence property were shown to hold using the incompressibility method and Kolmogorov's zero–one law, with normal numbers expressed as binary strings (in the sense of E. Borel) and the distribution of 0s and 1s in binary strings of high Kolmogorov complexity.
Turing-machine time complexity
The basic Turing machine, as conceived by Alan Turing in 1936, consists of a memory: a tape of potentially-infinite cells on which a symbol can be written and a finite control, with a read-write head attached, which scans a cell on the tape. At each step, the read-write head can change the symbol in the cell being scanned and move one cell left, right, or not at all according to instruction from the finite control. Turing machines with two tape symbols may be considered for convenience, but this is not essential.
In 1968, F. C. Hennie showed that such a Turing machine requires order to recognize the language of binary palindromes in the worst case. In 1977, W. J. Paul presented an incompressibility proof which showed that order time is required in the average case. For every integer , consider all words of that length. For convenience, consider words with the middle third of the word consisting of 0s. The accepting Turing machine ends with an accent state on the left (the beginning of the tape). A Turing-machine computation of a given word gives for each location (the boundary between adjacent cells) a sequence of crossings from left to right and right to left, each crossing in a particular state of the finite control. Positions in the middle third of a candidate word all have a crossing sequence of length (with a total computation time of ), or some position has a crossing sequence of . In the latter case, the word (if it is a palindrome) can be identified by that crossing sequence.
If other palindromes (ending in an accepting state on the left) have the same crossing sequence, the word (consisting of a prefix up to the position of the involved crossing sequence) of the original palindrome concatenated with a suffix the remaining length of the other palindrome would be accepted as well. Taking the palindrome of , the Kolmogorov complexity described by bits is a contradiction.
Since the overwhelming majority of binary palindromes have a high Kolmogorov complexity, this gives a lower bound on the average-case running time. The result is much more difficult, and shows that Turing machines with work tapes are more powerful than those with work tapes in real time (here one symbol per step).
In 1984, W. Maass and M. Li and P. M. B. Vitanyi showed that the simulation of two work tapes by one work tape of a Turing machine takes time deterministically (optimally, solving a 30-year open problem) and time nondeterministically (in, this is . More results concerning tapes, stacks and queues, deterministically and nondeterministically, were proven with the incompressibiity method.
Theory of computation
Heapsort is a sorting method, invented by J. W. J. Williams and refined by R. W. Floyd, which always runs in time. It is questionable whether Floyd's method is better than Williams' on average, although it is better in the worst case. Using the incompressibility method, it was shown that Williams' method runs on average in time and Floyd's method runs on average in time. The proof was suggested by Ian Munro.
Shellsort, discovered by Donald Shell in 1959, is a comparison sort which divides a list to be sorted into sublists and sorts them separately. The sorted sublists are then merged, reconstituting a partially-sorted list. This process repeats a number of times (the number of passes). The difficulty of analyzing the complexity of the sorting process is that it depends on the number of keys to be sorted, on the number of passes and the increments governing the scattering in each pass; the sublist is the list of keys which are the increment parameter apart. Although this sorting method inspired a large number of papers, only the worst case was established. For the average running time, only the best case for a two-pass Shellsort and an upper bound of for a particular increment sequence for three-pass Shellsort were established. A general lower bound on an average -pass Shellsort was given which was the first advance in this problem in four decades. In every pass, the comparison sort moves a key to another place a certain distance (a path length). All these path lengths are logarithmically coded for length in the correct order (of passes and keys). This allows the reconstruction of the unsorted list from the sorted list. If the unsorted list is incompressible (or nearly so), since the sorted list has near-zero Kolmogorov complexity (and the path lengths together give a certain code length) the sum must be at least as large as the Kolmogorov complexity of the original list. The sum of the path lengths corresponds to the running time, and the running time is lower-bounded in this argument by . This was improved to a lower bound of
where . This implies for example the Jiang-Li-Vitanyi lower bound for all -pass increment sequences and improves that lower bound for particular increment sequences;
the Janson-Knuth upper bound is matched by a lower bound for the used increment sequence, showing that three pass Shellsort for this increment sequence uses inversions.
Another example is as follows. are natural numbers and , it was shown that for every there is a Boolean matrix; every submatrix has a rank at least by the incompressibility method.
Logic
According to Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, in every formal system with computably enumerable theorems (or proofs) strong enough to contain Peano arithmetic, there are true (but unprovable) statements or theorems. This is proved by the incompressibility method; every formal system can be described finitely (for example, in bits). In such a formal system, we can express since it contains arithmetic. Given and a natural number , we can search exhaustively for a proof that some string of length satisfies . In this way, we obtain the first such string; : contradiction.
Comparison with other methods
Although the probabilistic method generally shows the existence of an object with a certain property in a class, the incompressibility method tends to show that the overwhelming majority of objects in the class (the average, or the expectation) have that property. It is sometimes easy to turn a probabilistic proof into an incompressibility proof or vice versa. In some cases, it is difficult or impossible to turn a proof by incompressibility into a probabilistic (or counting proof). In virtually all the cases of Turing-machine time complexity cited above, the incompressibility method solved problems which had been open for decades; no other proofs are known. Sometimes a proof by incompressibility can be turned into a proof by counting, as happened in the case of the general lower bound on the running time of Shellsort.

The 1968 Buffalo Bills season was the team's ninth season.
The Bills' 1–12–1 record in 1968 (a 0.107 winning percentage) is the second-worst in team history: the 1971 Bills went 1–13. They were one of only two teams in AFL history (the other being the 1962 Oakland Raiders) to finish the season with only one victory.
The Bills, coming off a 4–10 season in 1967, fired coach Joe Collier after an 0–2 start in 1968. Defensive backfield coach Harvey Johnson was promoted to interim head coach, where he went 1–10–1 to finish the year.
With the release of running back Wray Carlton, wide receiver Elbert Dubenion was the last player from the Bills' original roster in 1960 to still be with the team.
The majority of Buffalo's games were started by backup quarterback Dan Darragh, after injuries claimed the seasons of long-time starter Jack Kemp and new addition Tom Flores. Even Darragh and new addition Kay Stephenson were injured. Ultimately, running back Ed Rutkowski, who hadn't played the quarterback position since college six years prior, ended up starting at quarterback for the Bills.
Buffalo's only win of the season was a home victory over the New York Jets, in which the Bills held a 16-point lead in the fourth quarter before giving up two late touchdowns to the Jets. Ultimately, the Bills were able to hold on to the two-point win.
Offseason
August 24: Bills sign fullback Wayne Patrick.
August 27: Bills acquire quarterback (and future Bills head coach) Kay Stephenson from the San Diego Chargers for a Fifth Round Pick.
August 28: Bills acquire fullback Bob Cappadona from the Boston Patriots for a ninth round draft pick.
September 2: The Bills cut running backs Wray Carlton, wide receiver Ed Rutkowski (who would return later in the season as a quarterback), tight end Charley Ferguson and defensive tackle Dudley Meredith.

Cumberland County is a county located in the Pennyroyal Plateau region of the U.S. state of Kentucky. As of the 2010 census, the population was 6,856. Its county seat is Burkesville. The county was formed in 1798 and named for the Cumberland River, which in turn may have been named after the Duke of Cumberland or the English county of Cumberland.
History
Cumberland County was created in 1798 from land given by Green County. In 1829, the first commercial oil well in the United States was dug three miles north of Burkesville. It is usually not recognized as a commercial well because the drillers were looking for salt brine, but the oil was bottled and sold.
It was the first county in the United States to elect a female sheriff, Pearl Carter Pace.
Burkesville is the first town downstream from Wolf Creek Dam, so it is considered flood-proof, but there have been concerns about leaks at the dam. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed repairs in 2013.
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.8%) is water. Major waterways include the Cumberland River and a small branch of Dale Hollow Lake which covers the southern end of the county.

Politics
Like all of the heavily Unionist eastern Pennyroyal, a region of largely small farms that did not rely heavily on slavery, Cumberland County provided an exceptionally large number of soldiers for the Union Army during the Civil War. Reflecting that, the county became and has remained overwhelmingly Republican following the end of the Reconstruction Era. As of 2012, Cumberland County had the fewest registered Democrats, 844, out of all of Kentucky's counties.
The last Democrat to carry Cumberland County at the Presidential level was Horatio Seymour in 1868. And since at least 1896, Lyndon Johnson in his 1964 landslide is the solitary Democrat to top forty percent of the county's vote.
Cumberland County was a dry county prior to a special election held June 28, 2016, where the measure passed 1,441 votes to 1,069 votes.

Yekum Purkan (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic: יְקוּם פֻּרְקָן, lit. “may deliverance arise” or “may salvation arise”), is the name of two Aramaic prayers recited in the Ashkenazi Jewish liturgy immediately after the public reading of the Torah and the Prophets during the Sabbath morning service. The first prayer is for the welfare of Torah student and teachers, judges and leaders; the second is recited for the well-being of all the members of the congregation. A third prayer, in Hebrew, Mi Sheberakh (“May He Who blessed”) is also recited together with Yekum Purkan and asks for God's blessings on those who provide funds for the community's needs.
History
The two Yekum Purkan prayers were composed in Babylonia and are written in Aramaic, where Aramaic had been the daily language of the Jews for more than a thousand years until Arabic became the vernacular in the ninth century. The prayers do not appear in writing in the manuscript prayer books of the Babylonian geonim, Rabbi Amram Gaon (died 875) and Rabbi Saadiah Gaon (died 942), thus indicating a composition date towards the end of the Geonic period.
The first of the two prayers was composed in the tenth or eleventh century, when the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia were weakening and scholars in Europe were increasingly assuming Jewish religious leadership. The diminishing status of the academies led to a decrease in their revenues, and it was against this backdrop that Yekum Purkan was composed on behalf of the students and teachers of the academies, and their leaders – the geonim and the titular Head of the Diaspora known as the Resh Galuta or Exilarch. Thus, in addition to asking for God's help, the prayer also aimed to motivate people to give generously to support the academies of learning, and so were composed in the Aramaic vernacular rather than Hebrew and recited at Sabbath morning services when the largest number of congregants could be expected to be present.
The earliest written record of the first Yekum Purkan prayer is found in the Maḥzor Vitry manuscript of Simhah ben Shmuel of Vitry, who died 1105 in France. The earliest written record of the second prayer appears in the work known as Sefer HaRoke'ach by Eleazar ben Yehudah of Worms (c. 1176–1238). Neither prayer is found in the Sephardi liturgy, but a similar, although more lengthy prayer, called “Tefillah L'ma'an Ha'kahal” (Prayer for the Congregation) is found in some Yemenite prayer book manuscripts.
Yekum Purkan, and the Mi Sheberakh prayer that follows it, are among the earliest known recitations of personalized blessings in the Jewish liturgy, whose typical usage until then was standardized prayers using set Hebrew phrases, recited on behalf of the entire community, without specifying the roles or identities of the worshippers.
Content
Both prayers are very similar in form and derive their name from their opening words, yekum purkan, meaning “may deliverance arise” or “may salvation arise.”
The first is a prayer for the welfare of the Torah scholars in the Land of Israel and Babylonia, their teachers, the exilarch, and the judges. Many of the phrases of this prayer resemble those of the Kaddish de-Rabbanan ("the scholars' Kaddish"). It invokes God's blessings on the “heads of the academies” (the geonim), the “head of the Diaspora” (the exilarch) and the “judges at the gates” and requests divine favor for those who uphold Torah – by teaching, study, support and especially by undertaking the responsibilities of communal leadership.
The second Yekum Purkan prayer is phrased similarly to the first and is a more general prayer for the welfare of the congregation; it requests God's blessing for all the members of the congregation and their families “wives, sons and daughters and all that is theirs.”
Place in the liturgy
In the Ashkenazi ritual, the two Yekum Purkan prayers are recited on Sabbath morning, following the public reading of the Torah and the haftarah.
These prayers are recited on every Sabbath of the year, including festival days that occur on the Sabbath. However, they are not recited on festival weekdays, when instead, the service continues with Yah Eli, followed by Ashrei, or Yizkor on the final days of the festivals of Passover, Shavuot and Shmini Atzeret.
One reason given for Yekum Purkan not being recited on a weekday holiday is so as to end the lengthy holiday services somewhat earlier so that people can leave to prepare their holiday meal (on the Sabbath, meals are prepared before the Sabbath). Another reason suggested is that it was decided that the prayer for the support of Torah study was most appropriate for the Sabbath day, as the day on which the Torah was traditionally believed to have been given on Mount Sinai.
As the prayer concerns those who teach, learn and provide leadership and material support to maintain Torah study, the placement of the Yekum Purkan prayer in the order of the service is immediately following the readings from the Torah and Prophets.
Following the two paragraphs of Yekum Purkan, an additional prayer, the Mi Sheberakh (May He Who blessed our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob), is recited in honor of all those who volunteer for the benefit of the community and calls for God's blessings on those individuals who provide funds for the general welfare. It calls for special blessings to those who “give candles for illumination and wine for Kiddush and Havdalah, bread for guests and charity to the poor; and all who involve themselves faithfully with the needs of the community.” Mi Sheberakh is written in Hebrew but is read in the vernacular in some congregations because it clearly articulates the financial and moral responsibilities of the audience. In the Western Ashkenaic rite, this third prayer is omitted on Shabbat Mevorkhim.
Even though the academies of Babylonia and positions referred to in the first Yekum Purkan no longer exist and Aramaic is no longer a spoken language of the Jews, this prayer has remained part of the Sabbath liturgy. In modern times, some communities have added the phrase “and all that are in the lands of our dispersion” to make the prayer more relevant to them while others interpret the term “Babylonia” – when used together in distinction to the term “Land of Israel” – to apply to all the lands outside of the Land of Israel in which Jews were dispersed.
According to the Orthodox practice, a person who is praying alone does not say the second Yekum Purkan, as it is recited on behalf of the congregation, which is not present when one prays alone. Some halachic authorities rule that both paragraphs of Yekum Purkan should be omitted by someone who prays alone.

N. D. Burman was born at the Royal palace of Tripura situated in the Indian state of Tripura. He was the second son of Ishan Chandra Manikya (Ishanachandra Dev Burman), Raja of Tripura (r. 1849–1862). His mother was Queen Keisham Chanu Jatiswari. He and his elder brother were at their father's death in 1862 excluded from the throne of Tripura by their paternal uncle Bir Chandra Manikya, but from 1923 to 1927 he was President of the Regency Council of Tripura for his kinsman Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman, Maharaja of Tripura (r. 1923–1947). He was granted the personal title of Mahamanyabar on 31 January 1928.
The autobiography of Nabadwipchandra is known as Abarjanar Jhuri.
N.D. Burman was married to Nirupama Devi, by whom he had nine children including the famed singer and Indian film music composer Sachin Dev Burman (the youngest of five sons).

The church of St Thomas, the Apostle and Howard-Flaget House is a historic Roman Catholic church and home located at Bardstown, Nelson County, Kentucky. The church is a brick, cross-shaped plan with a round apse. It was designed by Baltimore architect Maximilian Godefroy and built 1813–1816. It closely resembles Godefroy's earlier St. Mary's Seminary Chapel in Baltimore, another Sulpician church. St. Thomas is the oldest Roman Catholic church in Kentucky and considered "The Cradle of Catholicism in Kentucky."
St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church and Howard-Flaget House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

6 (also known as 6 Melugu Varthigal or 6 Candles) is a 2013 Tamil crime thriller film written and directed by V. Z. Durai. It stars Shaam and Poonam Kaur. The lead character sports six looks and goes around six states to solve a mystery. The film was released on 20 September 2013 with positive reviews and became a sleeper hit. The movie is loosely based on the 2007 Korean movie Voice of a Murderer.
Plot
Ram is a young software engineer who lives with his wife Lizzy and their son Gautham, in Chennai. They lead a normal life until Gautam's sixth birthday, when they lose Gautham at a crowded beach. The police are not very helpful as Gautham is not the child of anyone with influence. However, after much pestering, the local inspector has one of his men take Ram and Lizzy to the slums in north Chennai to meet a petty criminal, Nayanar, who knows about all the crimes done by the dwellers in his area. Initially, he pretends not to know anything. However, after Lizzy begs at his feet, he finally reveals that Gautham might have been taken to Nagari in neighboring Andhra Pradesh to be sold to a local pimp, Krishna Rao. Ram then leaves for the pimp's brothel with two friends but finds that Rao only deals with grown women and not little children.
Back in Chennai, Ram goes to meet Nayanar, who accidentally let slip that Gautham might have been taken to another town in Andhra Pradesh although he is unsure of it. Coincidentally, the taxi driver, Rangan, who drove Ram and Lizzy to the slums, earlier meets Ram and tells him he has driven a businessman from that town back to his home after meeting Nayanaar a few years ago. The driver reluctantly agrees to take Ram there. Back in Andhra Pradesh, Ram and Rangan meet the businessman, Nallama Reddy who claims to lead an honest living by selling rice. However, Ram realizes Reddy is lying as the temple board states he is a quarry dealer. Ram holds Reddy's grandson at gunpoint and forces Reddy to reveal where Gautham is. Reddy then tells Ram his son might have been taken to a butchery at a nearby town.
At the butchery, the local gangsters already know that Ram is coming for them. Ram is prepared to face their attack. While struggling with the gang, its leader tells Ram that he already killed Gautham and sold the other children he abducted to a child trafficker in Bhopal named Nikhil Motwani after Reddy told them Ram is coming. Once the gangsters are defeated, Ram searches for Gautham's body but instead finds the corpse of another boy. Realizing that the gangsters killed the wrong boy, Ram is confident that Gautham is being taken to Bhopal and leaves immediately.
At Bhopal, Ram and Rangan manage to arrange a meeting with Motwani by posing as businessmen, but the human trafficker recognizes Ram from the news. He tells Ram that Gautham is being held by his henchman, Diwakar, and they can only release the boy if they are paid 1 crore. With no other choice, Ram calls up Lizzy to prepare the money and is taken to Diwakar's hideout. Unable to control himself after seeing a young schoolgirl almost being raped, Ram saves her by fighting off Diwakar's men and taking her to the Times of India's headquarters. When Ram and Rangan return to the hideout, they find it empty. As they explore the place, they discover that Gautham and many other abducted children have been kept prisoned there all along. Ram becomes hysterical when he finds Gautham's shirt on the floor along with his scribblings on the wall.
Once they are back on the road, Ram phones Diwakar and begs him to return Gautham but is instead taunted at. Meanwhile, Lizzy calls Rangan to tell him that she had borrowed money from friends and has banked it into Diwakar's account. When she finds out it is no longer of any use, she is devastated and faints. As Ram and Rangan prepare to leave, they are shot at by an assassin hired by Motwani. Ram survives, but Rangan is fatally shot. Before dying, Rangan reveals to Ram that he was the driver hired to drive Gautham's abductors around Chennai in search of victims. He then pleads to Ram to not give up and continue searching for his son.
Now left alone, Ram remembers his final conversation with Diwakar, who told him Gautham might be sold in Lucknow or Calcutta. He goes to Calcutta first and searches for Gautham at every place where child laborers and minor sex workers are being kept. As he comes to accept the fact that Gautham is not in the city, he phones Lizzy, whom he has not spoken to in months. She asks him to come home as there is nothing they can do to find their son now. Ram refuses to give up and heads for Lucknow. In Lucknow, Ram is found sleeping at the roadside by a kind person, Bhai, who takes him in and helps him find Gautham. Through one of his contacts, Bhai learns about a local crime boss who houses dozens of child laborers. Once there, the crime boss claims he does not deal in child trafficking and instead asks Ram to look for Diwakar in Bhopal. We are then shown in flashbacks how Ram managed to track down Diwakar, who let slip his new hiding spot during their last conversation, and killed him in a fit of anger before taking back his money. Shocked, the crime boss finally shows Ram his child laborers. Ram is too overwhelmed by the number of abducted children when each of them beg him to take them away from this place.
As Ram and Bhai prepare to leave, Ram notices that he dropped Gautham's shirt and they go back to get it back. Ram then sees one of the boys, who has terrible vision, holding the shirt. As Ram observes the boy's face closely, he realizes it is Gautham, whom he did not recognize earlier than his son has changed beyond recognition. The father and son embrace, as Bhai thanks the Lord for his blessing.

Production
The venture was first reported in September 2011 with Shaam in the lead, when a poster of a candle shaped like the number 6 was unveiled, with the media initially incorrectly reporting the title as 6 Candles. The film was initially planned as bilingual in Tamil and Telugu due to Shaam's newfound popularity after Kick (2009). An accompanying press note mentioned that V. Z. Durai had written and directed the film, while Jeyamohan would write the dialogue. R. Madhi, Srikanth Deva and Anthony were signed on as cinematographer, music composer and editor respectively. A special medical team headed by Dr. Selvam and comprising a physiotherapist, dietitian, yoga expert, meditation guide and a physical trainer was also set up to monitor the lead actor Shaam's health during the shoot as the role required him to go through physical changes. Early reports suggested that Priyamani and later reports suggested that would play a role, but she was replaced by Poonam Kaur. The Malayalam actor Jagathy Sreekumar and the Telugu actress Archana Shastry were also reported to play supporting roles, but these reports were proven false although the latter did appear in the film's trailer.
To attain a look with big eyebags, Shaam spent more than ten days without sleeping, which resulted in a big swelling below his eyes, so much so that the actor could not even be recognised. Although his effort gained notice, several contemporary actors criticized him for taking such a risk. For another look, Shaam reduced his weight from 89 to 72 kg and grew long hair and a beard.
Soundtrack
The soundtrack was composed by Srikanth Deva collaborating with V. Z. Durai for a second time, after Nepali. Durai made his debut as a lyricist and wrote all six songs. The audio was launched on 5 December 2012 at a function attended by Sneha, Ameer, Namitha, Abbas, Bharath, Vimala Raman, Shaam, Poonam Kaur, the Kannada actor Sudeep and many others. Behindwoods wrote, "Barring one song, the album has Srikanth Deva stepping out of his comfort zone and showing his capabilities at something different."

Critical reception
The film received positive reviews. The Times of India gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, "Despite the flaws, the plot keeps tugging along, managing to keep us always involved about the fate of the missing lad." It also wrote, "Shaam's physical transformation for this role is astounding, but his range, when it comes to expressing emotions as a performer seems to be somewhat limited." Sify called the film "tedious" and wrote, "The only silver lining is Shaam's performance, as father struggling to come to terms between his love for his son and situations life throws up." Baradwaj Rangan wrote, "It should make for riveting drama, a welcome change from the endless comedies we are subjected to. But a number of factors conspire to derail the narrative, beginning with the cast." Behindwoods gave 2.75 stars out of 5 and wrote, "A movie with good research by the director, V.Z.Dhorai and earnest hard work by actor Shaam, which could have been tightened as a better product." Though the film was well appreciated the film had a loss in box office.

Gozinaki or Gozinaqi ( ) is a traditional Georgian confection made of caramelized nuts, usually walnuts, fried in honey, and served exclusively on New Year's Eve and Christmas. In the western Georgian provinces of Imereti and Racha, it was sometimes called Churchkhela, a name more commonly applied to walnuts sewn onto a string, dipped in thickened white grape juice and dried. In several of Georgia's rural areas, both walnuts and honey used to have sacral associations. According to a long-established tradition, Gozinaki is served at special occasions, and is a mandatory component of New Year's Eve/Christmas celebrations.

Barrio Libre is a neighborhood in Tucson, Arizona notable for its existence as a relatively unchanged 19th-century Hispanic neighborhood of close-packed row houses. Houses in the barrio are typically adobe with very plain detailing, reflecting the area's history as a district of townhouses for Mexican ranching families. The district includes more than 200 contributing structures, with relatively few non-conforming buildings. The district is bounded by 14th and 18th streets to the north and south, and by Stone and Osborne to the east and west. Meyer Avenue runs through the center of the barrio.
The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 18, 1978.

Angevin is the traditional langue d'oïl spoken in Anjou, a historic province in western France. It was also spoken in neighboring regions like the Pays Nantais (along with Gallo), Maine (along with Mayennois) and Touraine (along with Tourangeau).
It is closely related to other oïl dialects spoken in western France, especially Sarthois, Mayennois and Norman (south of ligne Joret) in what could be called Eastern Armorican (Angevin-Mayennois-Sarthois-South Norman). Eastern Armorican, together with Gallo, forms the "zone armoricaine" of Langues d'oïl.
As an oïl language or dialect it shares many common features with French in vocabulary, phonemes and daily expressions.
It is also similar to the Gallo language (although Gallo has a stronger Celtic linguistic substrate that comes from Breton and not only from ancient Gaulish language). Angevin influenced the origin and development of Gallo in the Marches of Neustria (especially in the Breton March) beginning in the 9th and 10th centuries.
Angevin was the old speech of the Angevins or House of Plantagenet. However, in spite of this prestigious dynasty, Angevin never developed a notable literature, partially because the region of Anjou was integrated into the royal domains of the King of France (from the House of Capet) at the beginning of the 13th century, where the literary language was Parisian-based Francien.
Some words of Angevin origin were borrowed to English via Anglo-Norman at the Angevins domination of England.
Today it is almost an extinct dialect or language but it is preserved in the Rimiaux, poems written in Angevin, and also in some daily expressions.
Literature
The Rimiaux are some of the best expressions of Angevin literature. Several Rimiaux from Angevin poets and writers have been published.
Honoré de Balzac used some Angevin words and speech in his novel Eugénie Grandet.

Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Martyn Parsons (1 November 1910 – 7 June 1998) was a British Army marksman who played an important role developing and testing small arms and ammunition during the Second World War, and whose performance in post-war rifle competitions established him as one of the finest rifle marksmen in Britain.
Parsons was born in Bristol, and educated at Trent College, Derbyshire. His uncle was the architect Bertram Charles Hill. Also, one of his elder brothers was Ernest Geoffrey Parsons.
Military career
Parsons was commissioned in 1929 into the Royal Ulster Rifles, and went on in 1932 to become the Northern Ireland rifle champion. His prowess as a marksman made him a candidate for additional training, and he was sent in 1938 to a Long Small Arms technical course at the Ministry College of Science, where he became one of the first infantry officers to be awarded a technical qualification. This resulted in his being assigned during the war to rifle testing trials and small arms development for the War Office and Ministry of Defence. He was also posted to the Ordnance Department. He spent two years at the end of the war in Washington, D.C., and then was reassigned to the War Office, before being given the command in 1949 of his regimental depot.
It was in post-war rifle competitions where Parsons' marksman abilities became legendary. Shooting in 1949 and 1950 for his regimental team in National Rifle Association (NRA) competitions at the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey, he won the King's Medal (the highest honour) both years in a row, which made him the champion shot in the British Isles. He also won in 1949 the NRA Service Rifle Championships, the Queen Mary Cup and the Wantage Cup, the latter being the first time anyone had won the cup with a perfect shooting score. He eventually shot every year until 1959 with his regimental team at the Bisley competition.
His marksmanship was also unsurpassed in the Army Operational Shooting Competition at Bisley. He won the Bronze Jewell award there at the 1947, 1954 and 1955 competitions, and in 1951 he won the Silver Jewell as well. He ultimately shot in the Army competitions for 11 consecutive years (except 1953), and his name appears on every individual Rifle Championship Cup save one in the Army Rifle Association.
Parsons retired from the Army with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and moved to Bath, Somerset, where he was active in his later years in the restoration of historic buildings in the city. He died at the age of 87 on 7 June 1998 in Bath.

USS Coghlan (DD-606) was a Benson-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the second ship named for Joseph Bulloch Coghlan.
Coghlan was launched 12 February 1942 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; sponsored by Mrs. G. Coghlan; commissioned 10 July 1942, Lieutenant Commander B. F. Tompkins in command; and reported to the Pacific Fleet.
Service history
Coghlan sailed from San Francisco 22 September 1942 for Pearl Harbor and Kodiak, Alaska, arriving 13 October for convoy and patrol duty. She supported Army landings on Amchitka 12 January 1943, and participated in the bombardment of Gibson Island at the entrance of Chicago Harbor 18 February. On 20 February, she aided in the sinking of a Japanese merchantman. On 15 March she cleared Dutch Harbor with a force to patrol against Japanese shipping south and west of Kiska to prevent reinforcement of Japanese-held Attu. On 26 March, her group turned a larger Japanese force back in the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. In this action, Coghlan screened , and laid smoke for ; she was hit once by a Japanese shell, but sustained no casualties. She bombarded Holtz and Chicago harbors 26 April, and with the southern support group covered the landings on Attu from 11 May to 2 June. Overhauled at San Francisco in July, Coghlan returned to Adak on 13 August for 2 final weeks on patrol in the Aleutian Islands.
Coghlan sailed 25 August 1943 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 1 September. After taking part in the raids on Baker and Tarawa Islands from 15 to 17 September and the attack on Wake Island on 5 October, Coghlan replenished at Pearl Harbor and sailed on 31 October for escort and screening duties in the assault on the Gilbert Islands.

Critical Mass Melbourne is an informal grass roots collection of people who gather to take part in the month's Critical Mass event, which is a cycling event typically held in various cities throughout the world on the last Friday of every month, for traveling as a group through city or town streets on bikes. The rides in Melbourne began in November 1995, and have occurred every month since, with between 100 and 1000 riders involved. Like most Critical Mass events in other cities, the Melbourne rides have fostered the development of a coherent urban cycling community, the focus of which is the temporary intentional community of the rides themselves.
The biggest rides of the year are always held each November to celebrate the birthday of the first ride in Melbourne. These rides are typically five to ten times larger than a normal Critical Mass in Melbourne. This is also a suitable time of year to encourage cycling as the warmer weather arrives.
Rides occur at 6:00pm on the last Friday of every month, with people congregating on the steps of the State Library of Victoria from around 5pm: .
Critical Mass and CityLink 1999–2004
Following its opening in 1999, Critical Mass rode onto CityLink eight times. A policy of facilitated tolerance was adopted by Victoria Police based on history of no previous problems with the Critical Mass rides. This section summarises media reports that occurred after CityLink highlighted the rides in the media, ultimately causing the police to change their policy in 2004.
Critical Mass first crossed the Bolte Bridge in May 1999 before it was opened to traffic a few weeks later.
In June 2003 Critical Mass Melbourne rode through the Burnley Tunnel for the second time. Police Minister Andre Haermeyer said it was up to police to decide how to deal with the protest, "I think everyone has the right to protest and I think most of us accept some modest amount of inconvenience as a trade-off against that democratic right," and added "But this is just an outrageous impediment upon most people wanting to go home on a Friday night, the busiest night of the week. I think they're quite clearly a fringe element. I think they're irresponsible and reckless by taking the protest through the CityLink Tunnel." The Age described the event as a parade moving "peacefully amid a party atmosphere, with blaring music and much cheering". According to their report "Some riders wore silly hats, dressed as clowns and animals and decorated their bikes with stuffed toys and teddy bears." While State Opposition Leader Robert Doyle denounced the tunnel's closure as "political correctness gone mad", a Victoria Police spokeswoman was pleased the action was over quickly.
Cyclists rode over the Bolte Bridge in February 2004 as part of their Critical Mass ride. One of the complaints of Critical Mass is that the Bolte Bridge makes no provision for cycle access, whilst more broadly it further entrenches car and oil dependency. According to a police spokeswoman about 300 cyclists took part in the ride, forcing the closure of northbound lanes on the Bolte Bridge for about 25 minutes shortly after 7 pm. It was reported by the ABC that the protest minimally disrupted traffic.
Transport Minister Peter Batchelor denounced the event, "I think it's counterproductive; I think it works against the best interests of the cycling community," he told the ABC. Acting Police Superintendent Brett Guerin told the Herald Sun "Facilitating protests is always the best option and has proved to work in the past,"
In November 2004 Superintendent Mick Williams bypassed the previous policy of negotiation and facilitation and threatened a crackdown on cyclists using CityLink which prevented Critical Mass from entering the CityLink system. Brian, an environment professional who attended the ride, told the Jon Faine program on ABC radio that the Burnley Tunnel was an appropriate target for such a protest, but routes are decided on the night by the riders "It (the route) is decided on the night by the people who are there. The Burnley Tunnel represents car-only infrastructure development by a private company to serve a public function." He explained further that congestion on Citylink proved the infrastructure was failing and alternative means of transportation needed to gain greater prominence. "It (the ride) has raised the profile of the issue of the under-provision of infrastructure for bicycles and the failings of CityLink." he said.
Recent history
Critical Mass continued to gather each month between 2005 and 2014, with a focus on safer cycling and becoming a party on wheels/example of the freedom and enjoyment of cycling. Large infrastructure and major arteries were avoided in the interests of public safety and promoting cycling (and the event) as inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.
After numbers of attendees dropped off during 2015, Critical Mass Melbourne was reduced to a small hardcore group of die-hards. Attempts were made to have a closing ride to celebrate the death of Critical Mass but sufficient attendees could not be mustered. Attendance continued to decline until it reach zero in mid 2015.
Since 2016 new ride was promoted via social networking links and was touted to reappear on 29 January 2016.

Cerner Corporation is an American supplier of health information technology (HIT) services, devices, and hardware. As of February 2018, its products were in use at more than 27,000 facilities around the world. The company had more than 29,000 employees globally, with over 13,000 in Kansas City, Missouri. Its headquarters are in the suburb of North Kansas City, Missouri.
In December 2021, Oracle Corporation announced an agreement to buy Cerner for approximately $28.3 billion. The deal closed in June 2022.
History
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet. It went public in 1986. Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company's software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005 from $245.1 million in 1997.
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies, and wellness programs.

Products
The company's products include:
Millennium+, a cloud hosted EHR (Electronic Health Record).
Cerner FirstNet, emergency department system
Cerner RadNet Radiology Information System (RIS)
Cerner Learning Framework
The Cerner CCL (Cerner Command Language), is a SQL-like programming language developed by Cerner.
Controversy
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center," and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.
Canada
In 2016, the emergency department of Nanaimo Regional General Hospital in Nanaimo, British Columbia began using the system. The implementation, which cost $230 million, was met with widespread criticism, with staff calling it a "huge failure" due to an increase in software errors resulting in reduced efficiency of the department. An investigation by British Columbia's Health Ministry indicated that the project was not correctly planned or implemented and that organizational dysfunction at the facility contributed to the failure.
United Kingdom
In 2014, a coroner ruled that a three-year-old heart patient died as a result of a delay to his treatment at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. The coroner ruled that the hospital's outpatient booking system was responsible for the child not being seen or receiving treatment. The Royal United Hospital had recently installed the Cerner Millennium system. However appointments for the hospital's legacy booking system were not migrated to the new system.
United States
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster," according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward." Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) system because it had simultaneously modified its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They stated that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.
In 2010, Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011, notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system. As of June 2014, the case remained in arbitration. The outcome of the Girard case will likely be kept confidential due to contract provisions.
In 2012, Trinity Health, a large hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting software didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.
In 2014, a grand jury in California found that Cerner knew that the Ventura County healthcare agency was unprepared to complete a $32 million installation. Also in 2014, a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia had many problems, leading to forced resignations by the CEO and the CIO of ARHS.
Sweden
Concern has been expressed that the US CLOUD Act could enable US authorities to request data managed by US companies. It has been reported in Sweden that patient data managed by Cerner might be disclosed based on this requirement. Based on this concern, the Vastra Gotland and Skana region health care systems have decided to store any patient data managed by Cerner in Swedish data centers.
In 2022, the regional director of the Vastra Gotaland health care system in Sweden sent a letter to Cerner claiming a breach of contract for deployment of the Millenium system. The letter stated that there were numerous issues with the system that Cerner had declined to address. At the same time, a deployment of Millenium in region Skane has been delayed but is moving forward.
Locations
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri. It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005 and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City. In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236 acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009. Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.

Uri Giné (; born Oriol Giné de Lera; August 24, 1986) is a Spanish musician, singer and songwriter. He is best known as the founder, lead singer and songwriter of the alternative rock band Bongo Botrako from their formation in 2007 until their indefinite hiatus announcement in 2015.
Early life
Giné, the second of three children, was born and raised in Tarragona, Spain, a city just south of Barcelona. His mother, Maria José de Lera, is a nurse, and his father, Josep Giné, is a retired software developer. His younger sister, Alba, died at only ten months old from a heart malfunction, when Giné was 3. Some of his songs focus on the loss of his sister.
Giné grew up listening to his older sister, Celia, practise the piano for hours daily, but even though she and his parents tried to encourage him to play an instrument since he was young, he was reluctant for many years. At the age of 13, Celia gave him a cassette of a friend's punk rock band and he was so fascinated that he bought an electric guitar and started learning to play it and sing. He taught himself imitating rock, grunge and punk rock bands such as Nirvana, The Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Extremoduro.
Giné attended Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, but after four years taking classes in Audiovisual Communication, he dropped out to focus entirely on his musical career.
Career
Extracto de Lúpulo (2003–2009)
Giné joined punk rock band Extracto de Lúpulo in 2003 while in high school. He wrote his first songs for this band but he soon realised that some of the songs he wrote didn't fit in the genre, so he kept them apart. In late 2007, Giné decided to create his own band with all those songs and named it Bongo Botrako. In 2008 Giné recorded Extracto de Lúpulo's first album, El agua pa los peces, which was released in the following year. However, after almost two years running both bands at the same time, Bongo Botrako had become way more successful than Extracto de Lúpulo and many gigs started to coincide, so in 2009 Giné left Extracto de Lúpulo to focus entirely on Bongo Botrako.
Bongo Botrako (2007–2015)
In October 2007, Giné recorded a ten-track demo titled Bongo Botrako at his small home studio. He programmed the drums and performed all the rest of instruments himself. After passing the demo around, Giné quickly recruited eight more musicians and they started performing live in March 2008.
Giné wrote the song "Todos los días sale el sol" (also known as "Chipirón") in 2010 as part of Bongo Botrako's first album, Todos los días sale el sol, which was released on September 27, 2010. The song became very popular in Spain after the men's national basketball team players, including Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol and Ricky Rubio, took the habit of singing it before every game in the EuroBasket 2011 Championship, which they eventually won. In September 2011, "Todos los días sale el sol" peaked at No. 12 on the Spain Songs chart and No. 2 on the iTunes Spain Songs chart. The song accumulates more than 31 million streamings on YouTube and more than 31 million streamings on Spotify, which ultimately makes it Giné's most popular song by far.
The band's second studio album, Revoltosa, was released on November 12, 2012. Giné and his bandmates embarked on an extensive tour that took them to eleven European countries, reaching particular success in the Netherlands, where they played at major festivals such as Lowlands 2014, Parkpop 2015 and Zwarte Cross 2015.
The band's first and only live album, Punk Parranda, was released on November 3, 2014. They recorded it performing to a crowd of more than 60,000 people at Viña Rock Festival 2014 in Villarrobledo, Spain.
On October 13, 2015, Bongo Botrako announced an indefinite hiatus and a six-date farewell tour. Giné explained that he felt exhausted after eight years of non-stop touring and noted that the band had lost the enthusiasm. However, he said he would continue to write songs and he left the door open to create a new music project in the future. Bongo Botrako performed their last and 500th concert in Giné's hometown Tarragona on December 26, 2015.
Personal life
Giné has been an active supporter of human rights movements throughout his career as a musician. In 2012 and 2013, he performed two Amnesty International benefit shows in Barcelona. He also included an Amnesty International quote in the music video for Bongo Botrako's song "Revoltosa" in 2012.
In May 2016, Giné took an Accelerated Freefall training to become a solo skydiver. When he's not touring or songwriting, some of his main occupations are travelling, photography and skydiving.

The Schuylkill River Park Community Garden (SRPCG) is a unique approximately 70 plot (over of land) community garden located at 25th and Manning Streets in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Garden is one of only a very few located on Fairmount Park land, part of Philadelphia's Park System.
History
The site that is now the Garden and Schuylkill River Park was previously a B&O Railroad Station, which ran passenger service to New York City among other places, and the Kelly Brickyards. In the early 1980s, Gardeners began to dig out homemade plots, lay borders from cinder blocks and scrap wood, and start growing. They continued in this way happily for several years until the City of Philadelphia acquired the land and in 1984/1985 attempted to adsorb the site into the nascent Schuylkill River Park, writing the Garden out of these plans. Behind the effort to remove the Garden was the city's Managing Director at the time, Leo Brooks, who lived directly across the street and did not like looking out at a bare patch during the winter months. Like many community gardens, the future of this one was in jeopardy.
Through the extraordinary advocacy efforts of the Center City Residents' Association, led at the time by Bob Davidson and other neighbors, and particularly the strong support of Ernesta Ballard, then a commissioner of Fairmount Park and later president of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the city was persuaded to keep the Garden as part of the Park but only with substantial renovations such that it would prove a beautiful site in summer and in winter. John Collins, architect of Schuylkill River Park, was given this task. At its completion in 1988 the City of Philadelphia via Fairmount Park leased the land to the Center City Residents' Association. The Center City Residents' Association currently acts, through the Garden's Steering Committee, as manager of the site. As a tribute to its uniqueness, in January 2007 the SRPCG was invited to become and became part of the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Gardens. In 2009, the Garden joined PHS' City Harvest Program. In 2010, the Garden became a National Wildlife Federation certified Wildlife Habitat.
Current Garden
The Garden now exists in its general 1988 format and thrives as an urban oasis, outlet for gardening, and space for community building. To preserve access to the Garden as a community resource, Gardeners are limited to six year terms - after which time they must relinquish their plots and go back onto a waiting list before returning to the Garden. As with almost all community gardens and consistent with the terms under which it leases the land, the SRPCG maintains residency boundaries that define to whom plot leases can be made. These boundaries follow those of its parent organization, the Center City Residents' Association, exactly. Even with this limitation, the wait for a plot is still at least 1 – 3 years.
Starting in 2009 Gardeners began donating hundreds of pounds of produce annually to those in need through the City Harvest Program and working with groups from several local schools to provide horticultural opportunities. The City Harvest Program process starts in Philadelphia Prisons, where inmates grow seeds into seedling plants. These plants are distributed to area community gardens who grow them into produce. The produce is donated by gardeners to local food cupboards, who in turn distribute the food to those in need. In the 2010 season, SRPCG distributed over 500 pounds of produce to our food cupboard under the leadership of gardener Linda Zaimis who ran the program in 2011, 2012, and 2013.
In 2008 under the leadership of garden chair Derek Freres (chair for 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 seasons) SRPCG began a preservation and re-building effort to address 20 years of wear and tear including a much-needed plot border replacement, new lighting, border irrigation and fencing, bench repair and replacement, plumbing upgrades, among other improvements. In total over $40,000 was raised including a substantial amount from SRPCG Gardeners themselves. In addition a long-term maintenance fund was created during these years that perpetually sets aside a percentage of plot fees paid by gardeners each year to accumulate for future improvements.

Aeroflot Flight 2808 ( Reys 2808 Aeroflota) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Mineralnye Vody to Ivanovo, both in Russia, with a stopover in Donetsk, Ukraine on 27 August 1992. While attempting to land at Ivanovo airport, the Tupolev Tu-134 crashed into a group of buildings in the village of Lebyazhy Lug. Investigators determined the cause of the accident was errors made by the crew and the air traffic controller. There were no fatalities on the ground, but all 84 people on board the flight died in the crash.
Aircraft
The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-134A registered RA-65058 to Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained 26,307 flight hours and 16,388 pressurization cycles.
Crew
The cockpit crew consisted of the following:
Captain Vladimir Nikolayevich Gruzdev (Владимир Николаевич Груздев)
Co-pilot Vasiliy Yuryevich Gruzdev (Василий Юрьевич Груздев)
Flight engineer Mikhail Gennadievich Karlov (Михаил Геннадьевич Карлов)
Flight engineer instructor Yuri Mikhailovich Eremenko (Юрий Михайлович Ерёменко)
Navigator Mikhail Anatolevich Konovalov (Михаил Анатольевич Коновалов)
The two flight attendants in the cabin were Svetlana Ermilova (Светлана Ермилова) and Tatiana Mokrova (Татьяна Мокрова).
Synopsis
The second phase of the flight took off from Donetsk at 21:03 Moscow Time. On board the aircraft were the seven crew members and 77 passengers, of whom 21 were children. No issues in flight from Donetsk were reported. At 22:27 and at an altitude of the flight began to descend on a bearing of 60° in preparation for the approach, which was to be carried out by the pilot in command. The decrease in altitude occurred approximately from the airport and approximately from the point where the flight was due to turn for the approach. After the descent the flight remained at its current altitude for two minutes at a speed of .
After the Tu-134 passed Dobrynskoe as designated by air traffic control, while at a distance of from the airport, the crew contacted the air traffic controller who gave them permission descend to an altitude of and set them on a bearing of 292° for landing. At 22:39:20 the flight reported to be from the airport and at an altitude of when they were actually at an altitude of . As instructed the flight flew level for 25 seconds, decreasing airspeed from . At 22:39:40 while from the airport the controller gave the flight permission to descend to and transferred the flight to another controller in the tower. When communications with the new controller began the flight reported their altitude to be and proceeded with level flight for 25 seconds.
When the flight was to the right of the cut-off point of the glideslope they requested permission to enter landing mode. The flight, having deviated 9 kilometers from the route, had reached the transition level at 22:40. Upon receiving permission to reduce their altitude to and execute a fourth turn at 20°, they flight executed the procedure through a transition level of and a radial distance. The flight was then from the aerodrome and flying at a speed of when it had still not deployed the landing gear; in the preparations for landing the navigator forgot to set his altimeter to the correct pressure. During the third turn the aircraft reduced speed to at a consistent altitude. During the beginning of fourth turn the landing gear was released and the flaps adjusted only when the aircraft
was from the glideslope, while at an altitude of and a speed of . The fourth turn started with a roll of 20° at a distance of from the entrance to the runway; due to previous lateral deviations the roll would have had to reach 30° in order to proceed with the route.
At 22:41 the air traffic controller informed the flight crew of weather conditions with visibility being 1,200 meters and mild fog. Having lost two minutes of needed time to execute the planned route, there was not enough time to sufficiently reduce speed to , adjust flaps to 20°, and reach an altitude of safely to continue with the landing. Nevertheless, the crew continued with the landing and the air traffic controller did not give the crew any warnings. The aircraft exited the fourth turn at a distance of from the entrance to the runway with a speed of and an altitude above the limit but with the stabilizer, flaps and slats in the correct positions. At a distance of from the runway and an altitude of the navigator picked up on the deviation and asked the captain about correcting the deviation to which the captain initially refused. While descending to the glidepath at an altitude of the copilot corrected the left bank by adjusting the horizontal stabilizer in one procedure (changing the stabilizer required fulfilling three procedures); doing so caused the aircraft to become less stable.
At a distance of from the runway, the aircraft held a lateral deviation ranging from and an altitude of . To enter the glidepath, the captain began to turn to the right causing the aircraft to roll up to 35°. The procedure was carried out uncoordinated fashion, causing the vertical speed to increase to up to . After passing the Non-directional beacon at an altitude of (which should have been ) while to the left of the correct position relative to the runway, the navigator again warned the captain but was ignored. At an altitude of approximately the captain attempted to take the aircraft out of the bank but did not attempt to slow down the vertical speed. After the navigator's last attempt to convince the captain to abort the landing and make a go-around, the aircraft banked sharply to the right 10°.
The aircraft struck foliage to its right at a distance of from the start of the runway while on a bearing of 295° and to the left of the intended path. The aircraft crashed into the ground after first striking the trees; several brick buildings and cars were damaged by debris but no one on the ground was killed. All 84 passengers and crew were killed in the crash.
Conclusions
Investigation showed that there were no mechanical issues with the aircraft itself and the aircraft was intact until it had crashed.
The primary cause of the accident was the captain's decision to continue the route under unsuitable parameters for landing. Insufficient crew communication and poor cockpit resource management also led to periodic loss of control compounded by failure to follow guidelines for maximum rate of descent as outlined in the Tu-134's flight manual.
The air traffic controller at Ivanovo airport acted in violation of aviation guidelines by not notifying the crew about their deviations from the course and glide path.

Alicia Sánchez-Camacho Pérez (born 22 April 1967) is a Spanish lawyer and politician. She served as the President of the People's Party in Catalonia from 2008 to 2017.
Sánchez-Camacho was born to Manchego and Extremaduran parents in Blanes. Her father was a Guardia Civil officer.
Sánchez-Camacho was elected as a deputy for the Province of Girona in the Catalan parliamentary elections of 1999 and 2003. She was also elected as the Deputy for Barcelona Province in the Spanish general election of 2004. On 16 April 2008, Sánchez-Camacho was appointed by the Parliament of Catalonia to replace Daniel Sirera as one of its eight representatives in the Spanish Senate.
Following the People's Party's poor performance in Catalonia at the 2008 Spanish general election, Daniel Sirera reluctantly resigned as its regional chairman under pressure from the party's national leader, Mariano Rajoy. Sánchez-Camacho was Rajoy's chosen candidate for the regional chairmanship. She was challenged by Montserrat Nebrera, who ran on a more liberal-minded platform. Despite having the backing of the national leadership, Sánchez-Camacho polled a lower-than-expected 56% in winning the run-off election.
Ahead of the 2010 Catalan parliamentary election, Sánchez-Camacho took the unusual step in Spanish politics of setting up the country's tolerance of high immigration as a key campaign topic. Again, in 2013 and 2017, she was involved in the "Camargate" case, where she recorded a conversation with the objective of incriminating Catalan sovereignist parties and politicians in 2010.

In April 2010, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho was forced to apologize publicly for a diptych with radical xenophobic content with allusions to the skinheads of the city of Badalona, edited by the PP of Badalona (Barcelona), which linked Romanian citizens settled in the municipality with crime and the need for radical population increase to eradicate this "plague". The national leadership of his party had rejected the message the previous day after his complaint by the media. Subsequently, he visited the municipality accompanied by the French MEP Marie Thérèse Sanchez-Schmid to check on the ground the situation of the Romanian Gypsy community in the neighborhoods of La Salut and Sant Roc and hear the testimonies of the neighbors about the alleged bad coexistence with the Romanian community. On that same visit, Sánchez-Camacho asked the government for more border control and defended a "legal and orderly" immigration.
Camargate
In June 2013, a four-minutes conversation, referred to by the media as Camargate, was made public, held with María Victoria "Vicky" Álvarez (former sentimental partner of Jordi Pujol Ferrusola, Jordi Pujol's son) in the restaurant La Camarga, in L'Eixample of Barcelona, carried out by the Detective Agency Método 3, whose total duration was later uncovered by the Diario Público. The objective of the recording, whose participation Sánchez-Camacho strongly denied at the time, was to launch the so-called "Operation Catalonia", a political plot led by the PP against Catalan sovereignist parties and politicians. Declaring that the Pujol family had a fortune in Andorra would, according to Sanchez-Camacho, later "start Jordi Pujol Ferrusola's imputation". Denying his relationship with the case implied that he loaned false testimony before a judicial declaration and the commission of investigation of the Parlament de Catalunya.
The recording took place on July 7, 2010, and its duration was 2 hours and 22 minutes. First, the employee of Método 3 Alejandro Borreguero came to the restaurant with a vase of flowers that had a built-in microphone inside, and that would serve as a centerpiece. The recordings, which had already begun when the employee entered the restaurant shortly before 2:00 p.m., confirmed a conversation between the agent and a manager in which the assignment of Sánchez-Camacho was alluded to. In addition, he stated that Método 3 would take over the price of the meal. During the recording of the meal, which began after the technician left the restaurant, Sánchez-Camacho declared "Vicky, in the event that we could now do something with all of this, this meal has never happened.", " I have very good contacts inside the police [...] and I knew who they were going to arrest " and, especially, "I have a public prosecutor of my trust". Later, Sánchez-Camacho delivered a report with the results of the recording to the Ministry of the Interior, whose president Jorge Fernández Díaz would later also be involved in the "Operation Catalonia ".

USA-38, also known as GPS II-2 and GPS SVN-13, was an American navigation satellite which formed part of the Global Positioning System. It was the second of nine Block II GPS satellites to be launched, which were the first operational GPS satellites to be launched.
Background
It was part of the 21-satellite Global Positioning System (GPS) Block II series that provides precise position data (accurate to within 16 m) to military and civilian users worldwide. Its signals could be received on devices as small as a telephone. The GPS II satellites, built by Rockwell International for the Air Force Space Systems Division, each have a 7.5-year design life. The Air Force intends to launch a GPS II every 2 to 3 months until the constellation of 21 operational satellites and 3 spares is aloft. The GPS Block II join 7 operational Block 1 satellites.
Launch
USA-38 was launched at 22:19 UTC on 10 June 1989, atop a Delta II launch vehicle, flight number D185, flying in the 6925-9.5 configuration. The launch took place from Launch Complex 17A (LC-17A) at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), and placed USA-38 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into medium Earth orbit using a Star-37XFP apogee motor.
Mission
On 11 July 1989, USA-38 was in an orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of , a period of 717.92 minutes, and 54.5° of inclination to the equator. It operated in slot 3 of plane B of the GPS constellation. The satellite had a mass of , and generated 710 watts of power. It had a design life of 7.5 years, and deactived on 12 February 2004.

Blumenstein Castle is an estate house in the municipality of Solothurn of the Canton of Solothurn in Switzerland. It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. In 1952 it became the home of the Historical Museum of Solothurn.
History
The Régence style house was built in 1725–28 for the governor Franz Heinrich von Stäffis-Mollondin in the center of a terraced park. After Franz Heinrich's death in 1749 the estate passed to his son Joseph Lorenz von Stäffis-Mollondin. When Joseph died in 1758 without an heir the Stäffis-Mollondin family ended and the estate was divided between his daughters Johanna Karolina Anophe and Ludovika Franziska, their grandmother Jeanne Charlotte Cléophe and their mother Marie Jeanne Nicole. In 1797 Ludovika Franziska married Robert Fidel Carl Wallier von St. Aubin and the entire estate passed to the von St. Aubin family. In 1847 Ludovika Franziska died and Blumenstein passed to her sister in law Charlotte Glutz-Wallier von St. Aubin. About a decade later, in 1856, her sons Edmund, Ludwig and Alfred Glutz-Ruchti inherited the house. In 1861 Edmund bought out his brothers shares and became the only owner of Blumestein.
Edmund Glutz-Ruchti bequeathed Blumenstein in 1885 to his nephew Joseph Glutz-Ruchti. Over next decades Joseph modernized the old building and installed central heating which changed it from a summer residence into a home that was comfortable year round. He supported the renovations and lavish lifestyle by selling the furnishings and the lands around the estate. However, by the mid-1920s he was insolvent. When Joseph went bankrupt, Blumenstein was sold at auction. On 18 October 1928, the Basel architect HR Steuer bought the empty castle and the remaining garden for 400,000 Francs. The garden was divided into lots and sold as building land.
The main building and the land immediately around the building were purchased on 11 September 1933 by Fritz Hirt-Baumgartner for 85,000 francs. Over the following two decades Fritz Hirt-Baumgartner and his wife Lucie attempted to buy back all the furnishings and outbuildings from Blumenstein.
On 7 February 1951 the couple sold Blumenstein for CHF 180,000 along with its inventory for CHF 40,000 to the municipality of Solothurn. The Blumenstein Museum or Historical Museum of Solothurn opened on 3 May 1952. Fritz Hirt-Baumgartner's wife Lucie retained the right to reside in several rooms of the upper floor until her death in 1977.
Today the museum is open Tuesday to Saturday from 2:00PM to 5:00PM and Sunday from 10:00AM until 5:00PM. It is closed Mondays and some holidays. Admission is free and some rooms are available to rent for parties and meetings.

is a 1986 Japanese autobiographical film written and directed by Kaneto Shindō.
Plot
Haru, an aged scriptwriter living alone in a house in the mountains, reminiscences his childhood in Hiroshima Prefecture.
The youngest child of four, Haru grows up as the son of a wealthy landowner. His passive father serves as a guarantor of someone else's debts, and slowly loses the family's fortune. Haru's older brother confronts the father for his inactivity, even threatening him with a knife during a violent dispute. Unable to change the father's mind, the brother leaves the house and joins the police force.
The old Haru is paid a visit by a woman who delivers food to his remote residence. She discovers his draft for a novel, asking if he stopped writing screenplays. Haru replies that he is too old and, being the last surviving member of the family, wants to keep his mother's memory alive.
The oldest sister of the young Haru accepts the marriage proposal of an émigré whom she does not love, on the condition that he pays 2,000 yen to help pay the family's debts. Still, neither her dowry nor the younger sister's leaving for the city can prevent the bankruptcy. After selling the estate, Haru and his parents move into the warehouse, while the main house is demolished to sell the usable parts.
Eventually, the mother dies. Back in the present, the old Haru hears his mother's voice, calling him for supper, a reminder of the opening scene.

Paul R. Traub (born January 31, 1952) is an American attorney who specializes in business law, specifically bankruptcy, insolvency, and trial litigation. He has participated in several large retail bankruptcies, including Kmart, FAO Schwarz, KB Toys, Stage Stores, Office Max, and eToys.com. Other clients have included Halston, Joan & David, Levitz, Bombay Company, Linens 'n Things, Zales, and Whitehall Jewelers.
Early life and education
Traub was born in Brooklyn, New York. Traub earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University at Buffalo in 1973, followed by a Juris Doctor from the Golden Gate University School of Law in 1977. He was admitted to the New York Bar Association in 1978.
Career
He is admitted to practice law before the U.S. District Court Southern, Eastern and Western Districts of New York, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and Eastern District of Wisconsin.
Traub is the founding member and managing partner, of Traub, Bonacquist, and Fox, a New York-based boutique law firm specializing in bankruptcy and business reorganization matters. In September, 2006, Marc Dreier, sole equity partner of Dreier, LLP, acquired the boutique law firm. Paul Traub became a Dreier partner and co-chair with Norman Kinel of the Bankruptcy and Business Reorganization group.
On December 5, 2008, after Dreier's arrest for being involved in an alleged scheme to sell $700 million in fictitious promissory notes,
Traub and the other bankruptcy lawyers resigned and restarted Traub, Bonacquist & Fox. In February, 2009, Epstein, Becker & Green, a firm specializing in government contracts, brought the seven-member Traub/Dreier bankruptcy team into their New York office.
Traub represented the creditors in eToys.com bankruptcy. The dotcom company filed for chapter 11 protection toward the end of the Internet bubble on March 7, 2001. The Office for United States Trustee accused him and his New York law firm of a conflict of interest, non-disclosure, and employing non "arms length" key personnel, because of his business partnership with Barry Gold. In April, 2001, Traub founded Asset Disposition Advisors, LLC ( "ADA"), a Delaware liquidation company, with Gold, located at his Manhattan law office.
Traub also appointed Gold CEO of eToys.com one month after forming ADA, while Gold had been receiving paychecks from Traub's lawfirm. The Court ruled in favor of Traub: Gold's participation in ADA with Traub was not sufficient to establish a conflict of interest, although the judge said failure to disclose such relationships in future could lead to sanctions. "In the future ... the failure of an officer of a debtor to disclose such relationships will subject that officer to review and possible disgorgement of compensation, if the court concludes that the relationship constitutes an actual conflict of interest."

Established in 2003 and dissolved in 2012, Chicago's Baby Teeth came roaring back in 2022. Their second life brings joy to followers of lean pop/rock, thick vocal harmonies, generous hooks, and witty lyrics. The keyboard/bass/drum trio has drawn comparisons to Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, Elvis Costello, Queen, Joe Jackson, and Electric Light Orchestra. They've shared stages with indie luminaries like Fiery Furnaces and Silver Jews, made multiple appearances at Austin's South By Southwest festival, and earned glowing reviews in Pitchfork, AllMusic, and the Chicago Reader.
Playfully self-aware, Baby Teeth's energetic live show features ample three-part harmonies and memorable arrangements. Bassist Jim Cooper (Detholz!, Daniel Knox, Bobby Conn) and Peter Andreadis (All City Affairs) are both songwriters/bandleaders themselves, forming a pulsing, innovative rhythm section.
When he was 11, Baby Teeth singer/songwriter/keyboardist Abraham Levitan (Bobby Conn & the Glass Gypsies, Shame That Tune) began writing songs about middle age. Perhaps it was a little premature? Three decades later, he's celebrating and skewering marriage, fatherhood, middle-class ambition, and the paranoid remains of the American dream. What's left to do when reality crashes the party of your stadium-sized dreams? “Carry On Regardless”... to quote the title of Baby Teeth's forthcoming LP, coming fall 2022 and produced by Bobby Conn.

Lee (also, Lees Camp) is a former settlement in Inyo County, California.
It was located near the Nevada state line, east of Beatty Junction.
A post office operated at Lee from 1907 to 1912. Its first postmaster was John H. Lawrence. The name honors Richard and Gus Lee, who discovered gold at the site. Founded in 1905, Lee had a population of 600 people in 1907, and the town had a rivalry with nearby Rhyolite, Nevada. Lee had many saloons, a hiring hall of the Death Valley Miners Union, a store, a newspaper, and even a red-light district. However, the Panic of 1907 began the eventual decline of Lee. The town store was open until 1912, and the post office closed the same year. Several artifacts can be found at the site, including stone walls and foundations, along with mine shafts and tunnels, cans, and broken glass bottles.

The Pharmacovigilance Programme of India (PvPI) is an Indian government organization which identifies and responds to drug safety problems. Its activities include receiving reports of adverse drug events and taking necessary action to remedy problems. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation established the program in July 2010 with All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi as the National Coordination Centre, which later shifted to Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission in Ghaziabad on 15 April 2011.
History
Many developed countries set up their pharmacovigilance programs following the Thalidomide scandal in the 1960s. India set up its program in the 1980s. This general concept of drug safety monitoring went through different forms, but the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation established the present Pharmacovigilance Program of India in 2010. Now the program is well integrated with government legislation, a regulator as leader, and a research center as part of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission.
Activities
As of 2018 there were 250 centers around India capable of responding to reports of serious adverse reactions. One of the challenges of the organization is training doctors and hospitals to report adverse drug reactions when patients have them. The Pharmacovigilance Program makes these reports itself, but ideally, such reports could originate from any clinic. The Pharmacovigilance Programme seeks to encourage a culture and social expectation of reporting drug problems.
One of the successes of the program was detecting adverse effects of people in India using carbamazepine. While this drug is safer among people native to the Europe, people of South Asia have different genetics and are more likely to experience problems when using it. Other countries could not have been able to detect this problem, and the Pharmacovigilance Programme's detection of it was a success story.
Collaboration
The establishment of the Pharmacovigilance Program made India a more attractive international destination for foreign companies to bring clinical trials research. Understanding the quality of India's pharmacovigilance programme is key to international researchers conducting trials in India.
The program collaborates both in India and internationally with the World Health Organization on projects for safe medication. As a collaborating center, the Pharmacovigilance Programme assists the WHO in developing international policy for other countries to manage their own drug safety programs.
While the United States and Europe have pharmacovigilance systems which are developed well in some ways, the Indian programme has more and specialized expertise to apply for the unique circumstances of India. The Pharmaceutical industry in India produces more drugs than any other national industry. Because of the large amount of drugs and the many countries which import them, the Indian program monitors in some ways more than anywhere else.

Gillian Shelley Mary Rohde (17 May 1933 – 6 December 2007) was a British journalist and author. She was best known in North West England as a reporter and presenter on Granada Reports, but she is more widely remembered as the biographer of the artist L. S. Lowry.
Early life
She was born Gillian Shelley Mary Hall, on 17 May 1933, in Paddington, England, her parents being a scriptwriter father and an actress mother. Shelley took the surname of her mother's second husband, the pilot Douglas Rohde. She was largely brought up by her maternal grandmother, Patricia Reardon.
The path to adulthood led through Nottinghamshire. There had been many schools, and Shelley had contrived to be expelled from some. When she left school at 16, it was with no qualifications, and this was to impart a certain drive to her career.
Career
She secured her first job on the Nottinghamshire Free Press before gravitating to London and joining first The Star and later the Daily Express. The Express sent her to the Soviet Union, where at age 21 she became the first female foreign correspondent in Moscow. From her years in Moscow, not only did she learn Russian, but served as interpreter for the press when the Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin made their official visit to London in 1956.
Still only a young woman, she was a witness to the events of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Her coverage of it is mentioned in James Michener's book The Bridge at Andau, in particular an incident where journalists waiting at the bridge to interview fleeing refugees heard a baby crying. Risking a bullet, Rohde crossed the bridge to help the baby and family to safety.
In the 1960s she moved north to Manchester as chief feature writer for the Daily Mail and from there joined Granada Television, which gave her scope as a presenter of programmes and commentator of the local scene, chat host and debating chair, becoming a personality in her own right. She was a forceful personality, but generally treated her interviewees with sympathy and visibly entered into their enthusiasms and quirks. She had a memorable laugh. It was a mix of style that drew on the pioneering skills of the foreign correspondent and the knack of the local journalist in bringing out the interest in the lives of our neighbours.
L. S. Lowry
It was in this setting that she began to investigate the local artist L. S. Lowry and was eventually to become an acknowledged expert on him. Her documentary on him, L.S. Lowry: A Private View, was made after she had interviewed the artist personally, which she did several times during his later life. This was in itself an achievement, given that Lowry was known to be difficult to pin down to an interview appointment and to any clear content and was inclined to amuse himself by making up stories. He first told Rohde he had given up painting long ago, but it was noticed that the paint on a canvas was wet.
She was to write extensively about Lowry, including her book A private view of L.S. Lowry (revised as L.S. Lowry: A Biography), and won the Portico Prize for literary excellence in 2002 with another book, The Lowry Lexicon: An A-Z of L.S. Lowry. However, she was not monomaniacal and went on to do A-Z of Van Gogh.
Personal life and death
Rohde married Donald J Weaver in 1958 and the couple went on to have four children together, but they subsequently divorced. Rohde had three grandchildren.
Before her death she named a selection of three Lowry works that then became the focus of the exhibition Exploding Pictures at the Lowry in Salford, the major holding of the artist's work.
Rohde died on 6 December 2007 aged 74, following a ten-year struggle against cancer.

NaviSoft was a web server, web publishing and web hosting company based in the United States that was the first company to offer an integrated solution that combined a high-performance programmable web server, NaviServer, with a WYSIWYG HTML authoring tool, NaviPress, and a public web site for hosting published pages, public.navisoft.com. NaviSoft was acquired by AOL on November 30, 1994.
Under AOL, the products and hosting service were rebranded AOLpress, AOLserver, and AOL PrimeHost, and AOL continued to offer those products and services through AOL's Internet Services Company. In 1995, AOL also acquired the Global Network Navigator (GNN) and offered NaviSoft's products under the GNN brand. as well.
AOL eventually stopped offering the WYSIWYG HTML authoring tool and web hosting services, but they continued to use AOLServer internally to run AOL's web services. In 1999, AOL released the source code to AOLServer as open-source under the GNU or AOLServer Public License. A friendly fork of version 4.10 of the AOLServer source code was released, and is still being developed and maintained, as NaviServer.

Nationaltidende was a Danish daily newspaper published from 18 March 1876 to 3 September 1961 by De Ferslewske Blade in Copenhagen, Denmark.
History and profile
Nationaltidende was established by Jean Christian Ferslew in March 1876. It was started as an evening newspaper to supplement Dags-Telegrafen, also published by Ferslew, by September the same year the paper was published twice daily (morning and evening) as a high-quality newspaper for the bourgeoisie and the civil service. With its many supplements, Nationaltidende was Denmark's most richly presented daily. After breaking away from Dags-Telegraphen's management, Jean Christian Ferslew, the founder and owner, and Emil Bjerring, who was editor from 1876 to 1896, collaborated closely making significant headway in Danish journalism. Major contributors were Hermann Bang (society), P. Hansen (literature), (R. Besthorn) foreign news and Frantz von Jessen (politics). While it was a decidedly right-wing, royalist publication, it was also one of the most actively critical publications under the influence of Carl Carstensen who became editor in 1896. During the early 1900s it had a conservative stance which had its headquarters in Copenhagen.
From about 1908, Asger Carstensen attempted to develop the paper as the voice of middle-class conservatism built on universal suffrage. While Nationaltidende maintained editorial excellence, it increasingly ran into competition from Dags-Telegrphen (later Dagens Nyheder and Dagbladet), also run by the Ferslew group. From 1891 to 1920, the classified advertisement section (Avertissementstidende) became particularly important for the Copenhagen community. On Ferslew's death in 1910, the paper was beset by management problems. The same year its circulation was 10,000 copies. After modernization in 1914, the morning edition increasingly resembled Dagens Nyheder although the society and cultural columns in the evening edition continued in their own right. During the 1920s, Berlingske Tidende succeeded in attracting a significant proportion of the capital's classified advertisements, leading to financial problems and changes in staffing at Nationaltidende.
After Helweg-Larsen brought in a new team in 1926, the editorial situation improved but could not be maintained in the face of increasing competition from Berlingske'''. In 1931, Gyldendal bought up the Ferlew interests, combining its papers as Dagens Nyheder, but without much success. In 1936, the paper was sold further to two private investors.
With morning and evening editions each day, together with extensive coverage of foreign news and culture, it was aimed principally at the bourgeoisie and the civil service. Politically, it took a conservative slant. After running into difficulties in the 1920s, the paper merged with Dagens Nyheder on 14 July 1931. In the 1940s, thanks to its restored name (with the component "national"), it prospered during the German occupation of Denmark. After the war, in the face of competition, especially from Berlingske Tidende, its popularity gradually declined until it closed in 1961.
While Nationaltidende'' was hardly competitive, it maintained a high level of reporting and attracted ambitious new collaborators. Furthermore, it increasingly became an important political organ, especially during the years of German occupation, thanks partly to the "national" flavour of its name. After the war, its popularity slowly sagged, leading to final closure in 1961.

Blake Mycoskie (born August 26, 1976) is an American entrepreneur, author, and philanthropist. He is the founder of Toms Shoes and co-founder of Madefor.
Early life and education
Mycoskie was born in Arlington, Texas, to Mike Mycoskie, an orthopaedic surgeon, and Pam Mycoskie, an author. After first attending Arlington Martin High School, he graduated from St. Stephen's Episcopal School in Austin in 1995. Mycoskie, who began playing tennis when he was 10, attended Southern Methodist University on a partial tennis scholarship in 1995, and elected a dual major in philosophy and business. After an Achilles tendon injury he sustained as a sophomore, which effectively ended his tennis career, Mycoskie left SMU and launched his first business, EZ Laundry. Originally focused on SMU, which had no on-campus dry cleaning service, EZ Laundry expanded, ultimately employing more than 40 people, servicing three universities, and generating approximately $1 million in sales. Mycoskie sold the company to his partner in 1999.
Career
After college, Mycoskie moved to Nashville and founded Mycoskie Media, an outdoor billboard company that focused mainly on marketing country music. The company was quickly profitable, and was bought by Clear Channel nine months after its launch.
In 2001, Mycoskie and his sister, Paige Mycoskie, applied for the cast of Survivor. A member of the Survivor production team told them about The Amazing Race, which had yet to debut, and they instead pursued a team position on that show. They competed in the second season of The Amazing Race and finished in third place, missing a million dollar prize by four minutes. Mycoskie moved to Los Angeles later that year.
In Los Angeles, Mycoskie co-founded the cable network Reality Central with Larry Namer, a founder of E! Entertainment Television. Raising $25 million from venture capitalists, along with other members of reality show casts, the network launched in 2003 with a plan of airing original content and re-runs of reality programming. Although the network had moderate success, it folded in 2005 after Rupert Murdoch launched the Fox Reality Channel and outbid Reality Central for advertisers and programming. Determined to pursue an entrepreneurial path, Mycoskie then partnered with the founders of TrafficSchool.com to create DriversEd Direct, an online driver's education service which additionally offered behind-the-wheel training in hybrid and sport utility vehicles. To promote DriversEdDirect, he created Closer Marketing Group, a Santa Monica-based marketing firm specializing in brand development and viral marketing.
Mycoskie visited Argentina on vacation in 2006. While there, he met an American woman who was part of a volunteer organization that provided shoes for children in need. Mycoskie spent several days traveling from village to village with the group, as well as on his own. "[I witnessed] the intense pockets of poverty just outside the bustling capital", he wrote in a 2011 article for Business Insider. "It dramatically heightened my awareness. Yes, I knew somewhere in the back of my mind that poor children around the world often went barefoot, but now, for the first time, I saw the real effects of being shoeless: the blisters, the sores, the infections."
Inspired, Mycoskie returned to the United States and founded Shoes for Better Tomorrows. Designed as a for-profit business that could give new shoes to disadvantaged children, the company would donate a new pair of shoes for every pair of shoes sold. An early example of social entrepreneurship, the shoes, similar to the Argentinian Alpargata, were created to appeal to a worldwide audience, which would both sustain the company's mission and generate profit. Shoes for a Better Tomorrow, later shortened to Toms, was started in 2006; by 2013, the company had donated more than 10,000,000 pairs of shoes to people in need. The shoes are sold globally in more than 1000 stores.
In 2011, Toms expanded to include eyeglasses in its "one for one" offering—for every pair of sunglasses purchased, sight-saving medical treatment, prescription glasses, or surgery is donated to a person in need. While Mycoskie conceived the idea, a "Sight Giving Partner", the Seva Foundation, was contracted to administer the actual program, which launched in Nepal, Tibet, and Cambodia. In a 2012 interview with Fast Company, Mycoskie said it was helpful for him to work with Seva. "I've been there when (people have had) surgery ... and I've handed out the glasses. But as Toms grows, it has to be less about 'What's Blake's most intimate, joyful experience?' and more about 'What's the great need?'"
Mycoskie published the book Start Something That Matters in 2011. In it, he wrote about the virtues of social entrepreneurship and the concept of businesses using their profits and company assets to make charitable donations or engage in other charitable efforts, using his experience with Toms to demonstrate both the intangible and real returns. For every copy of Start Something That Matters sold, Mycoskie promised to give a children's book to a child in need. Fifty percent of royalties from the book were then used to provide grants to up-and-coming entrepreneurs, and Mycoskie increased this to 100% in late 2012. The book became a New York Times best-selling business book, and a number one New York Times best-seller in the advice category.
At SXSW in 2014, Mycoskie announced the launch of Toms Roasting Co., a company which offers coffee sourced through direct trade efforts in Rwanda, Honduras, Peru, Guatemala, and Malawi. Toms Roasting Co. will donate a week of water to people in need in supplier countries for every bag of coffee sold. In 2014, Mycoskie announced that Toms would launch an additional "one for one" product every year.
In August 2014, Mycoskie sold 50% of Toms to Bain Capital, retaining his role as Chief Shoe Giver. In a company press release, he said: "In eight short years, we've had incredible success, and now we need a strategic partner who shares our bold vision for the future and can help us realize it." He will donate 50% of the profits from the sale to establish a fund that identifies and supports social entrepreneurship and other causes. Bain committed to matching Mycoskie's donation to the fund, and will continue the one for one business model.
Mycoskie, with Pat Dossett, launched a wellness program called Madefor in March 2020. It is a subscription-based program that helps users adopt sustainable habits of body and mind; and develops lifestyle changes through practice-oriented monthly kit service. The kits are based on different scientific topics, and contain the literature along with a physical tool to monitor progress of the users' shift in behavior and mindset.
Personal life
Mycoskie lives in Jackson, Wyoming. He divorced his ex-wife, Heather Lang in 2020. They have one son, Summit, and one daughter, Charlie. Mycoskie also provides financial support to Wubetu Shimelash, a young boy from Ethiopia. He has been Shimelash's financial benefactor, supporting his education.
Mycoskie is an avid golfer, fly fisher, surfer and adventure athlete, who enjoys rock climbing and polo. He is an investor at Urban Golf Performance, and Athletic Brewing Company; and was a participant of the Sexiest Bachelor in America Pageant.

Carmignac is a French asset management firm founded in 1989 by Édouard Carmignac and Éric Helderlé. The firm is wholly employee-owned and has $44 billion of assets under management as of 2021, according to Forbes.
History
After its founding in 1989 in Paris, the firm opened its first office abroad in Luxembourg in 1999. In 2008, offices were established in Madrid and Milan, followed by London (2012) and Zurich (2015).
In 2000, Carmignac's assets amounted to €1 billion, reaching €13 billion in 2007. The firm's flagship fund, Carmignac Patrimoine, largely resisted the financial crisis of 2008, which led to an increase in assets in the following years, and it became one of the largest funds in Europe for a while, according to the FT.
Recent developments
In September 2018, it was announced that Édouard Carmignac would step down from running the Carmignac Investissement Fund, management of which passed to David Older.
Edouard Carmignac announced in January 2019 that he would step down as the portfolio manager of the Carmignac Patrimoine fund after holding this position for 30 years. Rose Ouahba and David Older succeeded Carmignac as dual leads of the Fund. However, Edouard Carmignac maintained his role as a member of the strategic investment committee and chief investment officer (CIO).
In June 2019, the company agreed to pay a €30 million as part of a settlement under a public interest judicial agreement against the discontinuation of proceedings by the National Financial Prosecutor's Office.
Funds managed
As of 2019, Carmignac manages 21 investment strategies. These activities include, among others, equity and fixed income management.
In May 2019, it was announced that Carmignac launched six new OEICs funds in the United Kingdom in a push to increase its European presence beyond the French market. The funds are similar to those the firm is already managing in France. In April 2019, Marie-Anne Allier took over the co-management of Carmignac Sécurité Fond. In the same year, three of the company's funds were certified with the French SRI label for sustainable investment vehicles.
The firm launched two more funds in June that year, called the Carmignac Portfolio Grandchildren fund and the Carmignac Portfolio Family Governed fund. These aim to provide financial security to children.

Souimun (Hangul 소의문, Hanja 昭義門; also known as Southwest Gate) was one of the Eight Gates of Seoul in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, South Korea, which surrounded the city in the Joseon Dynasty. The gate was also known as Seosomun (서소문, “West Small Gate”). The gate no longer exists, and there is a marker placed roughly where the gate once stood.
History
Souimun, which means “Promotion of Justice Gate,” was originally built in 1396. It was torn down by the Japanese authorities in 1914 during the early years of colonial rule of the country.
Commemoration
A marker has been erected near to where Souimun once stood. It is located next to a multi-storey car park structure, which is adjacent to the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper building on Seosomun-ro (street), in Jung-gu (district), in Seoul.

Rodna is an extinct town in Spokane County, in the U.S. state of Washington. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place.
A post office called Rodna was established in 1912, and remained in operation until 1931. A variant name was Ray.
Rodna was located in the far southeastern corner of Spokane County in the Channeled Scablands. The defunct Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway ran through the site of the town, which is now accessible via the Columbia Plateau Trail. Rodna's location is about two miles northeast of the Martin Road trailhead. The trail connects the site with the site of another ghost town, Mock, located 10 miles north along the trail. The unincorporated community of Amber and the small lake of the same name lie midway between the two ghost towns. There are restroom facilities at the Amber Lake trailhead but no other services in the small community.
There are numerous lakes and ponds, almost all of which are oriented in a southwest-to-northeast direction due to the scouring erosion of the Missoula floods, in the area surrounding Rodna.

Quintus Naevius Cordus Sutorius Macro (21 BC – AD 38) was a prefect of the Praetorian Guard, from 31 until 38, serving under the Roman Emperors Tiberius and Caligula. Upon falling out of favour, he killed himself.
Biography
Macro was born in 21 BC at Alba Fucens, a Roman town at the foot of Monte Velino, situated on a hill just to the north of the Via Valeria in Italy. Inscriptional evidence from the ruins of this town reveal that, prior to becoming Praetorian prefect, Macro had served as Praefectus vigilum, prefect of the vigiles, the Roman fire brigade and night watch. The date of this appointment and the length of his tenure are unknown.
Macro was appointed Praetorian prefect by Tiberius after the arrest of Sejanus. According to Tacitus, Macro was active in discrediting Sejanus and in directing the subsequent purge against his family and followers. As prefect, Macro wielded considerable influence. He furthered his ambitions by befriending Tiberius' grand-nephew Caligula, one of the Emperor's prospective heirs. According to Suetonius, Macro gained further favour by turning a blind eye to his wife Ennia Thrasylla's affair with Caligula, around the year 34.
When Tiberius died in the year 37, Macro sided with the new Emperor Caligula. According to Tacitus, Macro even played a role in bringing about Caligula's rise to power, by ordering Tiberius to be killed after it was revealed that reports of his death had been premature: Caligula had begun to take power immediately upon hearing that Tiberius had died of natural causes but without making sure that Tiberius was dead. Tiberius was still alive and, shortly after, was heard calling for food. In order to prevent an embarrassing and potentially dangerous situation, should Tiberius have reacted angrily to Caligula's hasty ascension to power, Macro "ordered the old Emperor to be smothered under a huge heap of clothes."
Macro was confident of rapid promotion for past services but Emperor Caligula was aware of the potential threat Macro posed and soon removed him from office. According to some sources, Macro was promised the governorship of Egypt but upon arriving at Ostia with Ennia to take ship, he was instead arrested and stripped of his office. Macro committed suicide soon after. Macro was able to leave enough money to provide an amphitheatre for his home town of Alba Fucens.

In the 1954 film, Demetrius and the Gladiators, he was played by Karl ( Killer) Davis

Replica is the fifth studio album by American electronic musician Daniel Lopatin under the stage name Oneohtrix Point Never, released on November 8, 2011 via Mexican Summer and Software. It features co-production by Joel Ford and Al Carlson, and was Lopatin's first work to be recorded in a studio. Stylistically, the album marks a shift away from Lopatin's previous synth-based works under the alias, instead showcasing a sample-based approach utilizing audio from 1980s and 1990s television advertisements.
Upon release, Replica received positive reviews from music critics and subsequently featured in the year-end lists of the best albums of 2011 by several publications, including The Boston Globe, Pitchfork, and Resident Advisor. The album peaked in the top 10 of the Billboard Top Dance/Electronic Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts.
Background
In contrast to his previous synthesizer-based releases as Oneohtrix Point Never, Replica was produced around audio samples from television advertisements procured by Lopatin, with the ads mainly dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. He proceeded to isolate the audio from the commercials, listening for sounds that would strike him as being "harmonically intense" and sampling them. This approach built on his 2010 sample-based cassette release Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1 under the alias Chuck Person. Lopatin described the album as having "as much to do with environmental, broadcasted, and club sounds as it does with more direct musical influences." Asked why he opted to use commercials as sample sources, Lopatin described his process as "looking for old things that are meaningful" then "restructuring and rearranging it to interfere with the original narrative and creating this new poetry." His production process involved opening several music players simultaneously to listen to several sounds in tandem, which he described as "raw listening and sketching". Lopatin focused particularly on "strange pauses and little incidental sounds" found in the commercials to use as samples.
Lopatin attributed the title to "the idea of the replica in culture as a way we deal with the decline of knowledge, or human knowledge going to waste because we're not immortal. But it's not a solution, it's just a way of coping with those mysteries... it's like an artistic attempt at conveying the original, and not a copy, so there's inherit failure to it." The cover for Replica is a 1936 illustration by Virgil Finlay from the pulp magazine Weird Tales, depicting a skeletal vampire looking at himself in a mirror. Lopatin felt that the image was an appropriate metaphor for the title and described it as "really morbid, but there's humor to it, too, because the skeleton's hair is pasta-like", which he called "a good approximation of how I deal with lots of depressing things—just put pasta hair on top and it's okay."
Composition
Replica was Lopatin's first album to be completed in a formal studio setting, with recording sessions taking place at the complex owned by his label Mexican Summer. He conceived it as "an electronic song cycle" and, despite the lack of conventional singing on the album, aimed for the album's tracks "to feel like vignettes that are recognizable and hummable, instead of just letting things glide ambiently." Replica is more substantially sample-based than Lopatin's previous work, and it has been characterized by Miles Bowe of Stereogum as "chopped and screwed plunderphonics" and by Larry Fitzmaurice of The Fader as "skyward sampledelia." Exclaim!s Mark E. Rich describes it as "a sharp left turn that has him indebted to early 2000s electronic visionaries like Matmos, Akufen and Matthew Herbert, utilizing a specific sample source across the record." The presence of rhythmic structures is more apparent in the album's songs, albeit through the use of sampled loops as opposed to conventional drum tracks and beats. In addition to the Roland Juno-60 synthesizer, which was prominently used on previous Oneohtrix Point Never albums, Lopatin and collaborators Al Carlson and Joel Ford utilized other digital instruments, including samplers such as the Roland SP-555 and Akai MPC and synthesizers such as the Spectrasonics Omnisphere, Roland D-50, and Yamaha CS-01.
Lopatin, Carlson, and Ford opted to keep Replica minimal in nature, and Lopatin noted that they "had a unwritten rule that we wouldn't get into more than 8 tracks per song". Jon Pareles of The New York Times identifies Lopatin's "preferred sounds" as sustained synthesizer chords and fragmented piano bits "that well up gradually, then ripple off into the distance." Jeff Siegel of Resident Advisor notes that "where many of his peers and forebears build their ambience from microscopic variations on the same few sounds, Lopatin doesn't settle for long", citing "Andro", where opening synthesizer swells eventually give way to a "drain-swirl of errant ticks and drums", and the "cut-up vocals" of "Remember". "Power of Persuasion" incorporates a shifting series of piano figures, and "Sleep Dealer" is built around several looped samples from a Wrigley's gum commercial, with repetition of the piece being tweaked from section to section. One of the album's more "percussive moments", "Child Soldier" incorporates "voices programmed into a martial cadence" juxtaposed with distorted samples and synthesizer sounds, and Carlson describes the song as "the thesis of the record; smooth meets agro."
Release
On August 17, 2011, Daniel Lopatin announced that Replica would be released on November 8 via Software, the imprint operated by Lopatin and Joel Ford, and Mexican Summer, and revealed the album's cover and track listing. On September 17, Lopatin previewed material from the album at a show held at the Rhythm Factory in London. In the build-up leading to the release of Replica, Lopatin released three songs from the album: "Sleep Dealer" on September 7, "Replica" on October 12, and "Nassau" on October 28. In addition, Lopatin released the music video for "Replica", a self-made collage of cartoon footage, on October 17, and the video for "Sleep Dealer", directed by Inga Copeland and Dean Blunt, on October 31. The album was made available for streaming in its entirety on November 1. On November 8, Replica was made available for purchase in CD, LP, and digital download formats. It peaked at numbers ten and seven on the Billboard Top Dance/Electronic Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts, respectively, for the week ending November 26, 2011.
Critical reception
Replica received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on 32 reviews. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork found "a real sense of discovery here, or possibilities being probed" and wrote that "what's most striking about Replica is how well-constructed these tracks are, which is especially impressive given the record's brevity". John Doran of NME acknowledged that "the theory side of what he does is interesting, but above and beyond that he continues to herald the next stage of analogue future psychedelia beyond Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children." The A.V. Clubs Christian Williams wrote that "its great strength and most beguiling feature is its ability to sand spiky textures down into soothing ones, and to transform the anodyne into the anxiety-inducing, simply through repetition." Spins Philip Sherburne called Replica "both lyrical and hypnotic" and "a deeply romantic testament to the possibilities of life in the Cloud."
Phil Mongredien, writing in The Observer, called Replica "an ambitious electronic song cycle" that "rewards repeated listening". K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic stated that though the album's reliance on samples of commercials "makes for an intriguing compositional back-story—and it clearly provided him a rich sound palette from which to draw—it's rare that that source material is specifically evident while listening; at best it functions on a more energetic, subconscious level." Robert Christgau, in his "Consumer Guide" column for MSN Music, commended Lopatin's "taste for content as well as form and for creation as well as contrarianism". Dave Simpson of The Guardian stated that "if Replica occasionally drifts – literally – too close to the whiffy bongs and flotation tanks of 90s chillout, it's never predictable, and is best experienced in a continuous sitting".
Accolades
Replica appeared in several publications' year-end lists of the best albums of 2011. The Boston Globe critic Michael Brodeur named it the year's best record and praised it as a "whole new way to understand ambient". The album also placed in the year-end lists of publications such as Clash, Consequence of Sound, Exclaim!, Fact, Pitchfork, The Quietus, Resident Advisor, Stereogum, The Wire, and XLR8R. Replica placed at number 35 on The Village Voices year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Pitchfork later included it at number 49 on their list of the 100 best albums of 2010–14. Spin magazine ranked it number 235 on their list of "The 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years (1985–2014)". In 2016, it was ranked at number 20 on Pitchforks list of the 50 best ambient albums of all time.

Miroslav Holeňák (born 10 February 1976) is a retired Czech footballer. He played mostly as defender but was also capable of playing in midfield.
Club career
Miroslav Holeňák began with football at the age of eight in his hometown Zlín, going on to make his professional debut as a midfielder in the 1993–94 season. Holeňák quickly became a starting player and three years later transferred to Petra Drnovice. After four years in Moravia Holeňák moved to Slovan Liberec for 14 million Czech crowns. Converted to a central defender, he went on to make a major contribution as the team secured the 2001–02 league title and was called up to the Czech national team. At the end of the 2002–03 season, it had appeared as though he would move to Sparta Prague, before he ultimately opted for a transfer to their rivals Slavia.
After the expiration of his contract Holeňák left the Gambrinus liga and joined the Austrian Bundesliga team SV Mattersburg. Only one year later Holeňák returned to the Czech Republic and again signed with FC Slovan Liberec.
International career
Holeňák debuted for the Czech national team on 27 March 2002 in a 0–0 draw against Wales in Cardiff. His second start came in April of the same year in Ioannina against Greece. His last match was a 4–1 victory against Slovakia in August 2002. He was included in the squad for the match against Austria on 11 October 2003 but did not start.

The Geraldine Lucas–Fabian Place Historic District in Jackson Hole, Wyoming is significant as the 1913 home of Geraldine Lucas, a single woman pioneer in a harsh environment. It later became the home of Harold Fabian, vice president of the Snake River Land Company, which assembled much of the land that became Jackson Hole National Monument for John D. Rockefeller, Jr.
The district includes eleven buildings, about north of Moose, Wyoming at the base of the Teton Range near Garnet Canyon. The site offers views of the Cathedral Group.
History
Geraldine Lucas was born in 1866 in Iowa City, Iowa and, following an unsuccessful marriage and with a degree from Oberlin College, became a teacher in New York. She retired in 1912 and sought a retirement home. She joined two brothers and a sister in Jackson Hole and built a cabin in 1913. She filed for a homestead claim, which was granted after a series of difficulties, in 1922. Through a series of deals, she eventually expanded her holdings to . She was also the second woman to ascend Grand Teton, making the climb in 1924 at age 58, guided by 16-year-old Paul Petzoldt, who had made his first climb of Grand Teton earlier that year.
During her lifetime, Geraldine was resolutely opposed to the activities of the Snake River Land Company, which was buying land in Jackson Hole on behalf of John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who planned to donate the land for the creation of what would become Grand Teton National Park. Acquisition of the prime Lucas property was a major aim for the company. After Geraldine's death the land was purchased by J.D. Kimmell, with the idea of subdividing and developing the land. He was, however, friends with Harold Fabian of the Snake River Land Company, and in 1944 sold the property to what had become the Jackson Hole Preserve in exchange for rights at Jenny Lake. Fabian and his family moved into the Lucas place in 1946, spending summers there until Harold's death in 1975, under a deal with the Park Service.
Park use
Following acquisition by the National Park Service, the property remained vacant. The 2016 National Park Service historic properties management report for Grand Teton National Park recommended that the buildings be repaired, becoming a visitor destination with interpretive signage.
The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 24, 1998.

Luc André Diouf Dioh (born 18 January 1965) is a Spanish politician as well as a trade unionist and syndicalist. He is known in the Spanish media for being the first politician of African descent elected from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, as well as for being homeless in the past and having to sleep on a beach of the Canary Islands for over a month.
Personal life
Diouf was born in Joal-Fadiouth, an island off the coast of Senegal. He is one of 10 siblings, with eight brothers and one sister, and grew up in an agricultural environment. Unlike most of Senegal, Diouf was raised Roman Catholic and most of his community was Christian.
Diouf attended the Cheikh Anta Diop University in the Senegalese capital of Dakar where he studied economics. After leaving the university, Diouf traveled to Lyon, then Utrecht, and then Cincinnati in search of work. In 1992 he emigrated to Gran Canaria because he had family members living there. He quickly ran out of money though and for 42 days Diouf was homeless and had to sleep on the beach. Eventually Diouf contracted pneumonia and had to be taken to a hospital in Las Palmas, where one of the nurses put him in contact with social workers. He would later get a job at a hotel in Jandía on the island of Fuerteventura and would also find work as a computer technician. Diof is a polyglot who speaks several languages: Wolof, Serer, French, and Spanish. He learned German while interacting with tourists at his hotel job.
In 2008 he received a one-year-and-a-half prison sentence for injuring another man in a street fight in 2005. Luc André falsely indicates that it began due to the racist comments of the victim, despite the fact that the sentence does not refer at any time to racist behavior. The victim was an elderly person who was kicked in the head by Luc André, leaving him with lifelong injuries, as reflected in the sentence.
In 1996 Diouf joined the Workers' Commissions, or CCOO, where he worked as an advisory technician, as coordinator in the union's immigrant information centers, and as the secretary of immigration for the union's division in the Canary Islands. In 2001 Diouf acquired Spanish citizenship.
Political career
Having participated in politics for a significant amount of time, in 2017 Diouf officially joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. In June 2017 he was appointed to the Federal Executive Commission of the party. He was on the party's second ballot list in the April 2019 Spanish general election, where he was elected to the 13th Congress of Deputies. Together with Ignacio Garriga, Diouf is only the second individual of sub-Saharan African descent elected to congress after Rita Bosaho.

Christian doesn't want to be stuck in a dead-end job and wants an opportunity that combines with his love of fitness, but having struggled to find any employment at all recently, and with a young daughter to support, it's now a case of taking whatever comes along.
Deneka Johnson - Having grown up in care, living in hostels and being held back by her poor school grades, Deneka is struggling to get a proper start in life. She's been applying for everything in her area, but most of the time she's not even getting as far as an interview. All she wants is the chance to better herself, and 64 year old salon owner Irene Soarse is ready to give her that chance.
Ellie Strocchi - Ellie trained to be a veterinary nurse in her native home town in Italy, but without the relevant UK qualifications, she's unable to pursue her first love of looking after animals. Ellie's tried her hand at various jobs like modeling, and holiday lets, but the 26-year-old fears that her Italian accent sometimes holds her back during job interviews.
Glenn Page - Aspiring politician Glenn is a sofa surfing political activist. Despite being educated with ‘A' levels in Media studies, History and IT and a 2:1 degree in Ancient History, none of this has helped him secure a job. With mounting debts close to £25 thousand, he's come to envy the friends who left education early and are now making good money. He needs to start earning, and earning fast. Will the future politician get Christchurch's' vote?
James Wilkes - James has never had a job so he's channeled all his energy into volunteering. It's a great way for him to keep busy and also to meet people, as he's a loner in his home Town in Gwent where the cooler kids call him ‘Blade' because of his long black coats. James has volunteered now for 2 years, even winning himself the title of “Volunteer of the Year”, but it's never amounted to a paid job. James is now struggling for opportunities in his area, which he is desperate to leave. A self-confessed computer geek, James would love a career in design, but at this stage just wants an opportunity. Will Christchurch give him that chance and welcome him with open arms?
Rachel Walsh - Since being sacked from her bar job 3 months ago, Goby Goth girl Rachel has been unable to get a job. She's determined to tame her temper, put her wild ways behind her, and secure herself a brighter future in Christchurch.
Remus Williams - DJ and ex-club promoter Remus is a bubbly 22-year old from Leicester. He loves to play up to an audience with his djing, but knows it's time to find himself a ‘proper job'.
Amber Wood - Self-confessed Daddy's girl Amber is the first to admit that she's used to being spoilt. This 18 year-old still doesn't know how to work a washing machine, or even cook an egg... but she's decided that it's time to cut the apron strings and start becoming independent. First step on that journey is to get herself a job!
Renee Gordon - Renee used to be an independent woman in her own right, but since losing her job at a call centre, Renee has been relying on her mum for financial support. However, she practices what she preaches and remains positive throughout which Renee puts down to her faith and relationship with God. Having put her partying days behind her, Renee is now a devout Christian, preferring to spend her time at church or spreading a positive message about life to others. If Renee can learn to knit and master enough knitting knowledge she could be offered a part-time job and become part of the Christchurch community.
Sean Blain - Until 3 years ago Sean worked in a bakery, but since losing that job single dad Sean has not found anything else in his local city of Liverpool, and has had to move back in with his parents who are helping him raise his little girl. Sean realizes it's time to move away and look for work elsewhere in the country.... Even if it means having to be away from the daughter he dotes on.
Reception
Sam Wollaston of The Guardian called the first episode "good television" and criticised Tony Hall for axing BBC Three. The Mayor of Christchurch, John Lofts, said the title of the programme "doesn't reflect what we believe the content of the programme to be".

Golden State Baptist College (GSBC) is an Independent Fundamental Baptist Bible college in Santa Clara, California, offering bachelor's degrees and master's degree programs in fields related to Christian ministry.
Programs
Programs offered are intended to lead students into the work of the ministry as pastors, assistants, missionaries, teachers, musicians, and the financial side of the Christian ministry. Unaccredited bachelor's degrees are offered in pastoral theology, pastoral assistant, missions, Christian ministries, music education, Christian education (elementary and secondary), and secretarial science. Unaccredited master's degree programs are also offered.
Accreditation status
Golden State Baptist College, like most Independent Fundamental Baptist Bible colleges, has chosen to maintain its independence from secular authorities by deliberately refraining from seeking or accepting accreditation. Thus, it is not accredited by any recognized accreditation body. As such, its degrees and credits earned are not recognized as valid to most potential employers or other educational institutions.
Rules
GSBC's Institutional Distinctives can be found on their website. The school promises to deny admission to applicants who are from "charismatic, 'Bible' church, 'Christian' church, non-denominational, or inter-denominational" churches. Another rule states that "The King James Version is the only English-language Bible that will be permitted on campus." The administration "stand[s] against the destructiveness of para-church organizations", a reference to Christian ministries not operating under the authority of a local church.
The General Information section highlights more rules for students. It states that "the activities on campus, the dormitory life, and the entire program of the college require the full participation and cooperation of every student." Students must attend North Valley Baptist Church, unless an active member of another "local, fundamental Baptist church" before applying to the school. Even then, the student "must first obtain special administrative approval in order to attend his home church while enrolled at GSBC." Attendance at the daily chapel service is required. "Golden State Baptist College students are expected to go soul winning for a minimum of three hours per week." Christian service of all students (such as teaching Sunday school classes, working on bus routes, or participating in the music ministry) "is required by the administration."
Dating is limited to "church dates" as well as planned activities on or off campus with chaperones. The campus is equipped with a "dating parlor" with arranged chairs and tables for activities and seating. Physical contact is prohibited, and intercourse is grounds for expulsion, and things such as kissing are also grounds for severe punishment.
Students must have their music choices approved by staff members. Any "secular music" is prohibited. If any is found, prompt removal will be requested by staff. A computer lab is provided on campus for students to utilize during assigned hours of operation, however students are also allowed to use the college's provided wifi within the rules that are given in the rule book (no video streaming, games, pornography, etc.)
Curfew for students is 10:30pm. Floor leaders perform routine "lights out" checks at 11:00 PM, however if a student is out at work they are allowed to be out as late as 1 AM.
North Valley Publications
North Valley Publications (NVP) is based at Golden State Baptist College, and is affiliated with North Valley Baptist Church. North Valley Publications is a small publisher that specializes in books on Christian living and Church leadership. Many of the books published by NVP are written by the college's chancellor, Dr. Jack Trieber.

Straight Point is a coastal region, forming a headland, between Exmouth and Budleigh Salterton in Devon on the south coast of England.
Location
Straight Point is about south of the city of Exeter, southeast of Exmouth and about southwest of Sidmouth.
The top of the headland is used by the Royal Marines as a firing range. To the west is Sandy Bay, a holiday beach, that can be reached either along the coastal path or through the large caravan park. To the east are Otter Cove and Littleton Cove.
Geology
The red sandstone cliffs at Straight Point show an interesting sequence of sandstones in the Exmouth Formation. Most of the western section is accessible at low tide from Sandy Bay. Only a small part of the eastern side is accessible at low tide. Predominantly the cliffs are composed of layers of "Aylesbeare Mudstone", but additionally with these sandstone Layers. These rock formations are important because they represent the earliest geology along the entire coast. They are from the Triassic period and date from 250 million years ago. Both sediments are markedly red, which indicates that they were formed in a desert.

The St. Johns Bridge is a steel suspension bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, United States, between the Cathedral Park neighborhood in North Portland and the Linnton and Northwest Industrial neighborhoods in Northwest Portland. It carries the U.S. Route 30 Bypass. It is the only suspension bridge in the Willamette Valley and one of three public highway suspension bridges in Oregon.
The bridge has a center span and a total length of . It is the tallest bridge in Portland, with two towers and a navigational clearance. The adjacent park and neighborhood of Cathedral Park are named after the Gothic Cathedral-like design of the bridge towers.
History
Designed by consulting engineers David B. Steinman (1886–1960) and Holton D. Robinson, of New York, the St. Johns was the longest suspension-type bridge west of the Mississippi River at the time of construction. It is the only major highway suspension bridge in the Willamette Valley and one of only three major highway suspension bridges in Oregon.
At the time of the proposal to build the bridge, the area was served by a ferry that carried 1,000 vehicles a day. The proposal for a bridge was initially met with skepticism in Multnomah County, since St. Johns and Linnton were over five miles (8 km) from the heart of the city, and local business owners had minimal political clout. But after a lobbying effort that included a vaudeville-style show performed at grange halls and schools throughout the county, voters approved a $4.25 million bonds for the bridge in the November 1928 elections. Initially, a cantilever bridge was proposed, but a suspension bridge was selected due to an estimated $640,000 savings in construction costs.
The construction of the bridge began a month before the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and provided many county residents with employment during the Great Depression. Because of its proximity to the Swan Island Municipal Airport, some government officials wanted the bridge painted yellow with black stripes. County officials waited until St. Patrick's Day 1931 to announce that it would be painted green.
Dedication of the bridge was put off for one month in order to make it the centerpiece of the 23rd annual Rose Festival. It was dedicated on June 13, 1931, and during the ceremony, the bridge engineer, David B. Steinman, said:
The bridge was built within 21 months and one million dollars under budget. At the time of its completion, the bridge had:
the highest clearance in the nation,
the longest prefabricated steel cable rope strands,
the tallest steel frame piers of reinforced concrete,
the first application of aviation clearance lights to the towers, and
longest suspension span west of Detroit, Michigan.
Eighteen years later, in the summer of 1949, 15-year-old high school student Thelma Taylor was abducted and held by her captor, Morris Leland, under the east side of the bridge (which was undeveloped at the time, now the location of Cathedral Park), and was eventually murdered there. The crime shocked the city and her killer was apprehended and put to death.
It was not until the Marquam Bridge in 1966 that another non-movable bridge would be built in Portland.
By the 1970s, the bridge had been allowed to deteriorate, and cash-strapped Multnomah County asked the state to take over maintenance. Initially, the state declined, since it was also suffering from a lack of funds. But pressure from an association of county governments forced the state government to take it over on August 31, 1975. A county official estimated the move saved them $10 million during the first ten years of state maintenance.
Portions of the east approaches and east span were repainted beginning in 1987 and completed in 1994.
In 1999, the Oregon Department of Transportation announced a $27 million rehabilitation project that began in March 2003 and was completed in the fall of 2005. Included in the project was replacement of the deck, repainting of the towers, waterproofing the main cables, lighting upgrades, and improving access for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. By November 2004, renovation costs soared to $38 million, due mostly to the need to replace nearly half of the 210 vertical suspender cables. During the project, the bridge sidewalks were closed at all times. In addition, the entire bridge was closed at night and continuously for a month. The newly refurbished bridge was rededicated on September 17, 2006.
In July 2015, a group of protesters affiliated with Greenpeace rappelled down from the bridge to prevent the icebreaker MSV Fennica from leaving Portland, because it was destined to help Shell Oil Company drill for oil in the Chukchi Sea. They stayed there for forty hours, prompting the icebreaker to turn around after an initial departure attempt a few hours into the blockade. The vessel did eventually get through after three climbers came down, although it was met by dozens of kayakers in the water who joined the effort to slow or stop the ship from moving forward.
In March 2019, a partially finished elaborate illegal skate park was discovered in the bridge's cable house located under the west side of the bridge. Following concerns about the skatepark's impacts on structural integrity of bridge, it was torn down in 2020.

Strategic Route 7 - Great Eastern was the designation given by Network Rail, from 2004 to 2009, to a grouping of railway lines in the East of England that encompassed the Great Eastern Main Line and its various branch lines. The route serviced the regional centres of Colchester, Ipswich and Norwich as well as the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich.
In 2010, Network Rail restructured its route categorisation. Routes 5 and 7 were merged into Strategic Route D: East Anglia.
Strategic route sections
The Route was divided into a number of separate Strategic Route Sections (SRS's) that were defined based on route use, infrastructure and historical lines.
Railway planning
As part of Network Rail's Strategic Business Plan a Route Plan for each route, including Route 7, was published annually. The Route 7 plans for 2008 and 2009 are made available online.
Together with Route 5 – West Anglia and Route 6 – North London Line and Thameside the route was included in the Greater Anglia Route Utilisation Strategy.
Proposed developments
The Greater Anglia RUS includes a number of proposals for the future development of the route.
In the medium term, 2009–14, this includes minor infrastructure works and additional rolling stock to allow main line peak-service trains to be extended to 12-car formation.
Also included is the proposal for the extension of platforms at Stratford to handle 12 cars, to allow all main line peak-service trains to be extended to 8 or 12-car formation.
In the longer term intentions are to continue the lengthening of peak trains to 12-car formation. Enhancements to the power supply of the route are intended for completion by 2012 to interface with those carried out on Route 5 and Route 6.

Frederick Michael George Hall (3 March 1985 – 24 April 2022) was a Bermudian professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
Early life
Hall grew up in St. George's, Bermuda, and started his football career as goalkeeper for the St. George's Colts in the island's junior league. From 2000 to 2004, he attended Holderness School in New Hampshire, where he was an all-state and a Lake Region All-Star, as well as being a Boston Globe All-Scholastic player, an All-New England selection, and a nominee for the Boston All-Scholastic Player of the Year, and was honored as a member of the NEPSSA Senior All-Star Game.
College career
Hall began playing college soccer at the University of South Florida in 2004, earning his first-career victory, recording six saves, in USF's 4–1 win over East Carolina.
He transferred to Quinnipiac University in 2006. At Quinnipiac, his goalkeeper coach was former Trinidad and Tobago, Portsmouth and West Ham United goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, who continued to be involved in his career later, arranging trials for Hall. Hall was a three-year starter for the Bobcats, earning 26 wins and 22 shutouts, while leading them to back-to-back NEC Tournament berths for the first time in program history in 2008 and 2009. In 2007, as a sophomore he the NCAA in save percentage (.915 or 91.5%) and saves per game (7.38). In 2007 and 2008, he was named to the All-NEC Second Team. During his senior year in 2009, he led the entire country with 121 saves. He was named to ESPN Soccernet's Top 10 Goalkeepers of 2010 Class of Prospects list following his senior season, also being named an All-NEC First Team All-star and named to the All-Tournament team, and a 2009 Adidas National Soccer Coaches Association of America All-North Atlantic Regional Second Team. He was also named the Bobats MVP and the Players' Player of the Year Award.
Club career
In the winter of 2009, Hall was invited to trials with Charlton Athletic, but opted to finish university before attempting trials or pursuing professional football.
He then joined the Bermuda Hogges in the USL Premier Development League.

Bruno Lozano (born 1983) is an American politician, United States Air Force veteran, and flight attendant. He has served as the Mayor of Del Rio, Texas, since 2018 when he defeated incumbent Robert Garza in the general election.
Early life
Lozano was born in Del Rio, Texas in 1983. He served as a security forces patrolman in the United States Air Force. While serving under 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell," Lozano was stationed at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina and deployed to Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait. Upon completing his military contract, Lozano moved to Chicago, Illinois. He began his airline career at SkyWest Airlines in 2007. He was hired at Delta Air Lines in 2014.
Political career
Lozano prioritized efforts to clean up the San Felipe Creek (Texas) and volunteer at local non-profits. According to Lozano, he decided to enter political life in 2016, supported and encouraged by his former high school classmates during a class reunion event. He was critical of the city's economic policies, which he says left the local economy stagnant even as neighboring cities boomed. He called on Millennial voters to break Baby Boomers' hold on local political power.
A Democrat, he ran against incumbent Mayor Robert Garza on a May 5, 2018 election, and won in a landslide, receiving 62% of the votes. A later recount confirmed the result.
His victory received attention in The Huffington Post and the national LGBT press, which highlighted both his military career and his flamboyant image.
Mayor Lozano is highly influential within Del Rio and a key figure within the Middle Rio Grande area. On August 26, 2020, Mayor Lozano was nominated and appointed as Third Vice President on the Middle Rio Grande Development Council, which represents multiple counties and cities within the Middle Rio Grande Region.
Lozano is committed to economic growth by enhancing international trade via transportation within the Del Rio and Middle Rio Grande Region. Lozano was appointed as Segment 3 Chairman to represent the Segment 3 portion of the Ports to Plains feasibility study under Texas House Bill 1079. Under his leadership, Lozano has worked alongside other mayors and judges within the Val Verde County, Texas, Maverick County, Texas, and Webb County, Texas to prioritize the current and future needs for an interstate grade level structure serving the port of entries. Mayor Lozano also served on the Ports to Plains Advisory Committee that was chaired by Mayor Dan Pope of Lubbock, Texas.
Laughlin Air Force Base, a vital employer in Del Rio, Texas, is a top priority for Lozano. He represented the City of Del Rio, and Laughlin AFB at The Pentagon during a Washington, D.C. municipal delegation visit in May, 2018 where he prioritized mission support, base housing, and quality of life improvements for airmen. Lozano has also relayed local concerns regarding the rise in unlawful border crossings during his term in office. Visits with United States Department of Homeland Security and media outreach have been crucial during the immigration crisis. Spanning two presidential terms, Lozano has advocated for municipal support and for a more transparent response from the federal government during the ongoing border crisis.
LGBTQI+ achievements
Lozano currently (2021) serves as president for Del Rio SAFE (Sexual Advocacy For Everyone), a local LGBTQI+ non-profit. Lozano has been featured on multiple news outlets due to his landslide win as the first openly gay elected official in Del Rio. Zoe Saldana featured Lozano in a mini documentary series on Great Big Story. He was also featured on Topic, an “entertaining and storytelling studio” from First Look Media. The short documentary follows Lozano shortly after his landslide win in 2018. He can be heard giving a keynote speech in front of a crowd at Eagle Pass, Texas Pride 2018. In 2021 Lozano performed in drag on HBO's We're Here alongside his drag mother Shangela when the show came to Del Rio.

Stade de la Maladière is a multi-purpose stadium in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home ground of Neuchâtel Xamax. The stadium holds 12,000. It replaced the old Stade de la Maladière.
History
The stadium opened in February 2007, with Neuchatel Xamax defeating La Chaux-de-Fonds by a scoreline of 3–2 in front of a sell-out crowd of 12,000 people. The stadium complex was officially inaugurated in June 2007. The complex includes a shopping mall underneath the stadium, a fire house, and six gymnasiums. A small piece of the roof fell off in July 2007.
The stadium has used a synthetic turf since its opening. The turf was replaced in 2015.
Portugal used the stadium as a training base for Euro 2008.
The European Rugby headquarters moved to the stadium site in 2014.

The Grob G 110 was a single-engined two-seat light aircraft, made mainly of glassfibre, which was designed and built by the German manufacturer Grob Aircraft in the early 1980s. Two prototypes were built, with the first example making its maiden flight on 6 February 1982, but development was abandoned after the first prototype crashed later that year.
Design and development
In 1972, the German machine tool manufacturer, Burkhardt Grob Untermehnensbereich Maschinenbau, set up a subsidiary, Grob Flugzeugbau, to build aircraft. Grob Flugzeugbau started by building Schempp-Hirth Standard Cirrus gliders under license before switching to its own designs of gliders and motor gliders. In 1982 Grob revealed a more conventional powered light aircraft, the Grob G 110. This was a two-seat low-wing monoplane suitable for use as a training aircraft for flying clubs. It was powered by a single Lycoming O-235 piston engine rated at and had a fixed tricycle landing gear. Pilot and passenger sat side by side in an enclosed cabin. Grob had considerable experience in composite aircraft construction from its years of using glassfibre in its Gliders, and the G 110 was largely built of glassfibre. The wings used an airfoil section designed to give laminar flow, in order to improve performance.
Two prototypes were built, with the first making its maiden flight on 6 February 1982. This aircraft crashed in August 1982 while testing the aircraft's spinning characteristics, when it could not be recovered from a flat spin, the test pilot escaping by parachute. Although testing continued with the second prototype, the type was abandoned without entering production with Grob designing a new two seat trainers, the Grob G 112. This too was a failure, as it was overweight, but the companies third attempt to enter the trainer market, the Grob G 115, flew in 1985.

The Competition Act 1998 is the current major source of competition law in the United Kingdom, along with the Enterprise Act 2002. The act provides an updated framework for identifying and dealing with restrictive business practices and abuse of a dominant market position.
One of the main purposes of this act was to harmonise the UK with EU competition policy, with Chapter I and II of the act mirroring the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of Amsterdam (formally Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome).
Chapter I Prohibitions
Deals with restrictive practices engaged by companies operating within the UK that distort, restrict or prevent competition. These are primarily in the form of horizontal agreements (agreements to collude between firms on the same level of the supply chain such as retailers or wholesalers). These agreements could be to limit output, collusively share information, fix prices, tender collectively and share markets out.
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is responsible for prosecuting such firms who engage in these activities, and are able to levy fines up to 10% of annual global turnover for every year in which a violation has taken place up to a maximum of 3 years.
Exemptions from prohibition are available if the firm can demonstrate that these practices are in the interest of the consumer through increasing market efficiencies or advancing technical progress.
Chapter II Prohibitions
Chapter II deals with the abuse of a dominant position by a firm who uses practices such as
predatory pricing, excessive prices, refusal to supply, vertical restraints and price discrimination to maximise profit, gain competitive advantage or otherwise restrict competition.
In investigating alleged breaches of chapter II a two-stage process is involved. Firstly it must be identified if the firm actually possesses a dominant market position. This can be done through various concentration indices such as the Herfindahl-Hirchman Index (HHI). Generally if a firm is found to have a market share in excess of 40% then it is considered a threat to competition.
There are no exemptions to chapter II as by its very definition as "abuse" of a market position, one must be guilty of wrongdoing for the chapter to apply.
An example of the effects of the act is that in 2004, public schools were investigated for fee-fixing by the Office of Fair Trading, and in 2005 fifty of the leading schools (including Ampleforth, Eton, Charterhouse, Gresham's, Harrow, Haileybury, Marlborough, Rugby, Sevenoaks, Shrewsbury, Stowe, Wellington and Winchester) were ordered to raise £3 million between them to be spent on charities nominated by the pupils of the schools involved in the years 2001–2003, and were banned from further sharing of information on their external fees.

In mathematics, in the field of ordinary differential equations, the Kneser theorem, named after Adolf Kneser, provides criteria to decide whether a differential equation is oscillating or not.
Statement of the theorem
Consider an ordinary linear homogeneous differential equation of the form
with
continuous.
We say this equation is oscillating if it has a solution y with infinitely many zeros, and non-oscillating otherwise.
The theorem states that the equation is non-oscillating if
and oscillating if
Example
To illustrate the theorem consider
where is real and non-zero. According to the theorem, solutions will be oscillating or not depending on whether is positive (non-oscillating) or negative (oscillating) because
To find the solutions for this choice of , and verify the theorem for this example, substitute the 'Ansatz'
which gives
This means that (for non-zero ) the general solution is
where and are arbitrary constants.
It is not hard to see that for positive the solutions do not oscillate while for negative the identity
shows that they do.
The general result follows from this example by the Sturm–Picone comparison theorem.
Extensions
There are many extensions to this result. For a recent account see.

Carnage is a multi-genre table-top gaming convention based in the Upper Valley of Vermont / New Hampshire. It typically covers all genres of tabletop gaming, like board games, role-playing games, CCGs, LARPs and historical and fantasy miniatures.
Carnage was featured on WCAX's The :30 on November 1, 2011.
History
First held in 1998 in West Lebanon, Carnage grew from the motivation "to give New England gamers a place where they could come, be themselves, enjoy their games and have fun." After its inaugural year in New Hampshire, Carnage based itself on the Vermont side of the Upper Valley, moving to Brownsville, VT in 1999 and then to Fairlee in 2003. In 2012, the organizers announced Carnage 2013 would be held at the Killington Grand Hotel. Carnage was once again on the move in 2019 with the organizers deciding to move the convention to the Mt Snow Resort in Dover, Vermont for the 2020 interaction. This move would allow the convention to continue to expand and locate it more centrally in New England. The COVID-19 pandemic postponed the planned move with the 2020 edition of Carnage being held instead as a virtual event; the change in venue will instead occur in 2021 for the 24th year of the convention.

Abelardo Vicioso (April 27, 1930 – January 13, 2004 ) was a Dominican intellectual, politician, lawyer, and poet.
Early years and education
Abelardo Sergio Vicioso González was born in 1930 in Santo Domingo. His parents were Sergio Vicioso and Leonor González, and he was the oldest one of five sons.
His talent for literature came through his early years as a child and his first poems were published in 1948, at the age of 18, in the newspaper "El Caribe". Vicioso studied law in the University of Sant Domingo and graduated in 1953.

Afterwards he became First Lieutenant, acting as Academy Military Instructor, and also directing the Army official magazine. Finally Vicioso was named as Military Prosecutor. However, and given the unbreathable existing political situation, he joined the groups who conspired against the tyrant. As advised, and in order to save his life, his father Sergio, with important connections in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, could take him out of the country designated as Vice-Council in Curaçao. Trujillo got terribly mad when he knew the decision, so instead decided to send his brother Vinicio, experienced piloto graduated from the prestigious Lackland US Air Force Base Academy in Texas- to Curaçao to bring back his brother Abelardo. Both being in danger, finally decided to stay in the former Dutch colony, then transferring to Cuba, as political refugees. But there they were kept in prison by Fidel Castro government accused of being Trujillo's spies, version Trujillo officially spread. One year later they were both released. Simultaneously, his family in Santo Domingo was retained in the military base of San Isidro as lure hostages, being tortured psicologically for several months. Previously, there was an attempt of poisoning his father Sergio, hospitalized in Padre Billini Hospital, action discovered and aborted by nurse nuns.
In 1963 he returned to his native land, the Dominican Republic, after Trujillo had been executed (1961), when Juan Bosch -first democratic President elected democratically after dictatorship-, came to power (although overthrown seven months later by conservative forces). Just a few months before, his tormented brother Vinicio unfortunately committed suicide.
In 1965, during April Revolution held to reconstitute the government of Juan Bosch, his poem "Canto a Santo Domingo Vertical" became a hymn of combatants. The whole family supported the conflict by conforming the comando named Los Lobos located in Arzobispo Meriño street almost corner Mercedes street, where even kids and women healed and prepared food for the rebels and also placed mirrors in the rooftop of the building to dazzle attacking opponent plane pilots in order to avoid their lethal falling bombs.
After concluding the Civil War and US Intervention, Vicioso became professor of the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) -Autonomous since 1961 and where he graduated of law in 1953-, being elected first as Director of Literature Department of the Faculty of Humanities, later than Vice-Dean of said Faculty, and finally Dean for two consecutive periods.
Political activity
During his stay in Cuba, Vicioso co-founded the People's Socialist Party. Years later (1982), this political organization joined the Dominican Liberation Party(PLD), and Abelardo immediately integrated into its Central Committee. He was also personal assistant to Professor Juan Bosch, the President of the Party. In 1992 he left PLD and founded the Alliance for Democracy, of which Abelardo was vice-president. Afterwrads, the Alliance for Democracy supported PLD and during the first presidential term of Leonel Fernández Reina (1996-2000) Vicioso was his Special Assistant.
He always stood for the Cuban revolution. He co-founded the Dominican Friends of Cuba Committee, and later became its president.
In 1997, he was appointed life president of the Casa del Poeta (Poet's House).
Personal life
In 1964 Abelardo married Altagracia Solano, daughter of a wealthy landowner Santiago de los Caballeros, with whom procreated two children: Cynthia and Carlos.
Vicioso was born with a hereditary disease named ankylosing spondyloarthritis (a rheumatic disease with pain and joint stiffening).
During his last years of Life he began to writeg his first (and only) autobiographical novel with the title of "Memorias del Teniente Veneno" (Memoirs of Lieutenant Poison).

Louis de Gorrevod (born c. 1473 – died 1535) was a Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal.
Biography
Louis de Gorrevod was born in the province of Bresse, the property of the House of Savoy, perhaps in the city of Bourg, c. 1472, the son of Jean de Gorrevod and Jeanne de Loriol-Challes. Jean de Gorrevod was the son of Hugonin Seigneur de Gorrevod; he had three brothers and a sister; Jean's brother Guillaume died without issue, but in his Testament, dated 19 September 1482, he left his property to his nephews Laurent and Louis. Louis' elder brother, Laurent, became a Councilor of Marguerite of Austria and Governor of Bresse, and was Baron of Montanay and Count of Pont-de-Vaux; he was one of the executors of Regent Marguerite's Last Will and Testament. Laurent and Louis also had a sister Jeanne.
Early in his career, he was a protonotary apostolic. He was also the Almoner of the Duke of Savoy. On 27 January 1499, he became a canon of the cathedral chapter of St. Pierre Cathedral in Geneva.
Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne
On 29 July 1499, five days after the death of Bishop Étienne de Morel, the ten canons who formed the Chapter of the Cathedral of Saint-Jean met to elect his successor. Names were proposed and discussed. When the vote was taken, they chose the twenty-six year old Louis de Gorrevod as their bishop. On 9 August 1499, his election as Bishop of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne was approved, though he continued to live in Geneva. For Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne he was assigned an auxiliary bishop, Jean de Joly, titular Bishop of Hebron in the Holy Land.
Like his predecessor, Louis de Gorrevod was also Abbot Commendatory of the Monastery of S. Maria de Ambronay (Ambrogniaci), and Abbot Commendatory of the Monastery of St. Pierre de Berne. He was also ex officio patron of the Priory of Brou (founded by Marguerite of Austria in 1521) and a member of the college of the priests of the Church of Nôtre-Dame. In 1501, he had officiated at the marriage of Philibert II, Duke of Savoy and Margaret of Austria in Romain-Moûtiers. From 1507 to 1509, he occasionally carried out functions for François Brunaud, auxiliary bishop of Geneva and Vicar-General of the Diocese. From 1495 to 1509 there was no Bishop of Geneva. The diocese was being administered by the Bishop of Lausanne.
At the beginning of the sixteenth century the Bishops of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne still enjoyed considerable powers of both an ecclesiastical and political sort, as vassals of the Dukes of Savoy. On 2 March 1506 Bishop Louis de Gorrevod, in an act of reform, issued a set of Constitutions regulating the relationship between the bishop, his officers, the communes and vassals of the Bishopric. This applied particularly to the episcopal collectors of taxes, including the taille and the décime (dîme), and to the various officials who demanded endless paperwork, for each piece of which a fee was imposed.
Bourg-en-Bresse
On 17 May 1515 Pope Leo X elevated the diocese of Turin to the status of Metropolitan, with an Archbishop. Savoy was being highly favored. On 21 May he created the Archbishopric of Chambéry. The diocese of Bourg-en-Bresse was created on 21 May 1515 by the Bull Pro excellenti praeminentia of Pope Leo X, perhaps at the request of the Emperor Maximilian, perhaps at the request of the Emperor's daughter, Marguerite d'Autriche, whose dowry included Bresse, and certainly at the request of Duke Charles III. Bishop Louis de Gorrevod was one of four ambassadors sent to Rome to congratulate the new Pope, Leo X, on his election to the Papacy, and to thank him for the ecclesiastical promotions. The creation of the diocese of Bourg caused no pleasure to the Primate of the Gauls, the Archbishop of Lyon, François de Rohan, whose ecclesiastical territory had included Bresse. Nor did the increased prestige of Savoy and encroachment on Gaul please King Francis I of France. In 1515, Louis de Gorrevod became the first Bishop of Bourg-en-Bresse.
After the Battle of Marignano and the Concordat of 18 August 1516 between France and Leo X, the new diocese was suppressed. From 1516, therefore, Louis de Gorrevod was again only bishop of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, and the Canons of his Cathedral of Bourg were only canons of a collegiate church. But the diocese was reestablished by Leo X on 13 November 1521, eighteen days before his death, and so therefore were the Bishop and Canons.
On 19 October 1528, Bishop de Gorrevod acted as proxy for Marguerite d'Autriche at the baptism of Prince Emanuel-Philibert, the future Duke of Savoy, in the Saint-Chapelle of the Castle of Chambéry.
Cardinal
Bishop Louis de Gorrevod was created a cardinal priest in the consistory of 9 March 1530 by Pope Clement VII. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Cesareo in Palatio on 16 May 1530. On 5 December 1530, the pope made him Papal Legate to all the domains of the Duke of Savoy, thereby making him the supreme ecclesiastical authority in the realms of the Duke of Savoy next after the Pope himself. It is said that Cardinal de Gorrevod resigned his see of Bourg-en-Bresse in favor of his nephew Jean-Philibert de Challes on 10 April 1532.
Cardinal de Gorrevod did not participate in the papal Conclave of 11–12 October 1534, which elected Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who chose the name Paul III.
On 8 April 1534, Cardinal de Gorrevod presided over the ceremony of the transfer of the "Holy Shroud" (pannus Sindon nuncupatus), which had suffered serious damage from fire, from the Sainte Chapelle in the castle of Chambéry, where it was being kept by its owner the Duke of Savoy, to the Convent of the Poor Clares in Chambéry, where repair work was to be done on the cloth. The procès verbal of Cardinal de Gorrevod, giving full details of the event, survives.
Cardinal de Gorrevod resigned the diocese of Bourg-en-Bresse in 1534 and the diocese was once again suppressed, on 4 January 1535 by Pope Paul III.
Cardinal de Gorrevod died in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne on 22 April 1535. He was buried in the cathedral of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, before the high altar, where his memorial inscription gives the date of 1535:
Hic iacet Reverendissimus in Christo Pater Dominus Ludovicus de GorrevodoTit. Sancti Caesarei in Palatio Presbyter Cardinalis Maurianensis nuncupatus Sabaudiae Legatus,qui hoc sacellum fundavit et dotavit, Anno Domini M.D.XXXV

The grey-crowned tanager or grey-crowned palm-tanager (Phaenicophilus poliocephalus) is a species of bird in the family Phaenicophilidae. It was formerly placed in the family Thraupidae. It is endemic to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (split between the Dominican Republic and Haiti).
Distribution
P. poliocephalus is common, but local, on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti, and on the satellite islands of Île-à-Vache, Grande Cayemite and Gonâve Island. In the Dominican Republic, it is rare on the north and south slopes of the Sierra de Bahoruco, and on the southern part of Loma de Toro and Hoyo de Pelempito.
Habitat
Its natural habitats are lowland and montane moist forests, mangrove forests, rural gardens, and heavily degraded former forest. It is threatened by habitat loss, particularly deforestation in Haiti.

Gómez had his first senior experience with Mexico as a non-roster trainee during their loss to the United States in the 2021 CONCACAF Nations League Finals. Gómez was subsequently named to the United States senior provisional squad for the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup, although he did not make the final roster as the United States won the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final over Mexico. In October 2021, Gómez played in a pair of friendlies for Mexico U20s in Marbella, Spain.
On December 3, 2021, Gómez was called up to the United States national team for a friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in Carson, California. On December 18, 2021, Gómez made his international debut in the second half of the match and his shot on goal was rebounded in by Cole Bassett for the United States' 1–0 victory.
On April 21, 2022, Gómez was included in the Mexico national team call-up for a friendly match against Guatemala on April 27, in which he was subbed on in the 82nd minute. He thus became just the fourth player to be capped by both the United States and Mexico senior national teams, joining Martín Vásquez, Edgar Castillo, and Julián Araujo. Because both matches were friendlies, Gómez was not cap-tied to either nation.
On September 21, 2022, Gómez debuted for the United States U20s as a starter in a 3–1 victory over Peru U20s as part of preparation for the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup for which the United States qualified and Mexico did not.
Personal life
He is the younger brother of soccer player Johan Gomez, who formerly played for North Texas SC before moving to FC Porto.
