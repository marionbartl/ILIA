Reclaim The Streets have been rallying to unlock Sydney's nightlife restraints for quite some time, but this weekend the crew are turning their attention to marriage equality.
With the plebiscite for marriage equality currently rolling out and dividing conservative and progressive Australians, the team behind Reclaim The Streets have decided it's about time for another gathering, with plans to take over Prince Alfred Park on Saturday, Sept 23, to promote a YES vote. Because, after all, it's 2017 and people should be able to marry whoever the hell they want already!
Speaking on the event, a spokesperson from Reclaim The Streets says they “hope this festival will provide the queer community with a collective moment of catharsis as they cast their votes together.”
“Getting thousands of people together for a festival will also be an opportunity reaffirm, and form new friendships and connections needed to fight this long, damaging campaign for marriage equality.”
It's never a RTS rally without some hot tuna, though, with Saturday's soundtrack coming from a fine selection of local crews such as:
Deeper Than House
Swerve Saturdays
SYD DEF JAM
INPUT
Roots Odyssey
Rabbit Prawn Kollective – RPK
The Church of Screaming Electro
Umami

Cruise to Toulon
I watched my wife and children sleeping gently, as I got up at 06h55 on 11 Sep 11 to see us cruising through the gentle rays of the sunrise into Toulon.
We were sailing on the Royal Caribbean International's Liberty of the Seas, the second largest cruise ship in the world, and it took some delicate sideways manoevers to parallel park next to the dock at La Seyne - a small town next to Toulon.
We decided to give all the guided tours a skip and do our own thing in Toulon - we didn't want to be bound by a leaving time, as we weren't sure how well our little one would acclimatise to the Aquanauts kiddies club, and wanted to give her all the time she needed (it was our first day at sea).
After settling our daughter in (no problem!) we caught a taxi to the historical centre of Toulon for 25 Euros (bus would have cost USD15, but we were in a hurry). Our taxi driver was a rather innovative fellow - he tied his seatbelt around the back of the driver's seat, so he wouldn't be bothered by the continuous beeping of a BMW, telling you to put your seatbelt on.
About Toulon
Toulon has been a French town since 1482, and is situated between Nice and Marseille, in Provence. Behind Toulon is Mont-Faron and in front of it is the sea. Its economy revolves around the French naval base (as you cruise into Toulon you can see various naval ships) and tourism.
If you're not into cruising then you can fly to Toulon-Hyeres airport (18km east of Toulon), Marseille-Provence airport (100km west of Toulon) or Nice-Cote d'Azur airport (150km east of Toulon). It's often cheapest for South Africans to fly to London, and then catch a Ryanair flights from London Stansted to Toulon.
The historical center of Toulon is the lowest part of the town, located just north of the harbour. Go for walks along Lafayette and Algiers Streets, which are filled with shops and get crowded on Saturdays. See the Place Puget, the center of the historical center.
Near Place Puget is the Saint Marie de la Seds Cathedral, half-built but never finished (in the 11th Century).
See the Tour de l'horlage, a clock at the entry of the naval base
The Rugby Club of Toulon play at Stade Mayol in the middle of the town
Take the cable car to the Mont-Faron Hill
When visiting a place for the first time, I like to find the best vantage point from which to see its entirety. The top of Mont-Faron Hill was my first stop in Toulon. Go buy tickets for the cable car at the tourist office in the historical centre - for 6 Euros they gave us a combined ticket for bus number 40 (leaves adjacent to the old Church) to Telephonique stop, the cable car ride to the top, the bus back and a ferry trip. At the tourist office also get a copy of the bus timetable (on Sunday buses are especially infrequent).
Mount Faron was the scene of fighting during the sieges of 1707 and 1793, then under the German occupation in 1944. With the increase in artillery range, the Beaumont Tower was built between 1842 & 1845 as part of a warning system to prevent its occupation by enemy troops, who who could have endangered Toulon. The Beaumont Tower is home to the Memorial Museum of the August 1944 Provence Landing. Be aware that this is France and they often take an extended lunch break, so for example we couldn't visit the inside of the Beaumont Tower, as it was closed between 12h00 and 14h00. This has happened to me before on the Eiffel Tower, where I had to wait an hour for the ticket office to open before I could get to the top floor.
There were other itmes of interest - besides the stunning views of Toulon, there's a World War II battletank and a WWII anti-aircraft gun. There are also memorial stones to :
"Captaine Lamy" who was the first to arrive on Mount Faron on the 22nd August 1944, at the head of the 3rd Company.
Lieutenant J.M. Chipier who died in the Battle of Toulon
There's also a very friendly shopkeeper at the top of the Mont, who sells a variety of Toulon-related tourist items - I recommend a stop there.
English aint patient people
This sign at the furnicular said "thank you for your patience" in French and German, but not in english (no need to thank the english for their patience, as they have none!).
Visit the harbour and its promenade
Visit one of the cafes and sit outside and watch the world pass you by, as you sip on your drink. There are loads of yachts in the harbour and in the distance you can see French naval vessels. I enjoyed an Orangina and waffle at Haagen Dazs.
Ferry ride
A ferry ride across the bay is well worth it, if you want to see the French naval ships up close and get a wider angle view of the whole town.
Here's a photo from the ferry.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has declared a recent string of large whale deaths around Alaska to be an "Unusual Mortality Event".
And, well, yeah. Here's why:
You don't need to be an expert in whale strandings to know that things are looking pretty bleak. As of August, 11 fin whales, 14 humpback whales, one gray whale and four unidentified species have been spotted dead in the western Gulf of Alaska. The unexpected upticks in deaths -- 30 since May, more than three times the average for the area -- have triggered an official investigation.
[Endangered whales are dying off in Alaska, and scientists are racing to discover why]
According to an FAQ on NOAA's Web site, deaths have also been reported by researchers in neighboring British Columbia. An unusual number of birds have also been dying this summer along the Alaska Peninsula, but it's not clear whether any of these deaths are related.

"NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners are very concerned about the large number of whales stranding in the western Gulf of Alaska in recent months," Teri Rowles, NOAA Fisheries' marine mammal health and stranding response coordinator, said in a statement. "While we do not yet know the cause of these strandings, our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live."
[Scientists are puzzling out the mass death of endangered whales in Chile]
It could take months or years for the scientists working with NOAA to find some explanation for these deaths. So far, they've only been able to collect tissue samples from one of the 30 carcasses -- many of which have been unretrievable, or too badly decomposed to study -- and even that sample didn't present a clear cause of death.
One cause that they've basically ruled out is radiation exposure. All it takes is a quick Google to know that many instinctively blame the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster for animal deaths. In acknowledgement of that, NOAA has added a note to its FAQ confirming that the tissue they sampled showed no signs of such contamination, but they'll continue to test for it.
For now, nearby residents can help out by calling in any dead whales they spot.

2016 has been a busy year for Capcom, especially in the West. First, Street Fighter V hit store shelves worldwide on Feb 16th and has, according to news from October, has been struggling to sell well since. Then Monster Hunter Generations reached North American audiences during the summer. Since then, a brand-new sequel to Generations has been announced. But according to a story posted by Esuteru, Capcom is already looking into long-term plans for their franchises, included a major focus beyond Japan for Monster Hunter.
As a NeoGAF thread posted by user zeromcd73 reports, Capcom feels Street Fighter V will continue to be sold and played due to its ability to be taken seriously as an eSport. Likewise, the Japanese publisher also acknowledged that their unique market skill is in their ability to appeal to consumers beyond Japan. Concluding that Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate‘s sales were lower in the West than in the company's home country of Japan, they blame this on the gap between Japanese and American handheld markets, in which Japanese consumers use handhelds more often than the West. So while Capcom has not announced any firm plans, the company is restructuring their approach to the West through the Monster Hunter series.
It's hard to say if this could mean more dedicated Monster Hunter console releases anytime soon. The company did predict that 100 million PlayStation 4 units and around 40 or 50 million Xbox One units will be bought by 2020, and Capcom has traditionally published games on both consoles. But as Street Fighter V shows, just because a game has brand recognition doesn't necessarily mean it will push copies. After all, fans feel sceptical about Street Fighter V‘s capabilities due to its frame and mechanical flaws. But Capcom certainly is planning for long-term growth, so stay tuned as more news develops.
Vulnerable crossdomain.xml files can be used by malicious people to run CSRF attacks if the victim has Flash installed on their computer. In response to a post by chs on crossdomain.xml proofs of concept and Seth Art's real-world exploit of Bing using crossdomain.xml, I created an application in Ruby which parses the Alexa top million site list (CSV, 10MB) and scans for vulnerable crossdomain.xml files. Vulnerable here is defined as a crossdomain.xml file which permits connections from any domain name (*). It sorts the domains into four categories:
Unable to connect: Ruby was unable to establish a connection to the website. Interestingly enough, a significant portion of Alexa's top million sites were inaccessible during this survey.
Invalid or 404: Returned 404 or the returned XML was not valid.
Secure: The XML returned does not contain a reference to allow-access-from domain=”*”. This does not necessarily mean that the whole crossdomain.xml file is secure, just that it is not vulnerable to the most basic of CSRF exploits.
Permissive: The XML returned from a GET to /crossdomain.xml does allow access from any domain.
Without further ado, let's get into it.
The Code
I chose Ruby for this project because it has good XML processing libraries, is reasonably fast, and because I needed an excuse to practice Ruby.
require 'net/http' require 'rexml/document' include REXML require 'csv' counters = { 'unconnect' => 0 , 'invalid-404' => 0 , 'permissive' => 0 , 'secure' => 0 , 'total-count' => 0 } trap 'SIGINT' do print counters . inspect exit 130 end permissive = CSV . open ( 'permissive.csv' , 'wb' ) CSV . foreach ( 'top-1m.csv' ) do | row | counters [ 'total-count' ] += 1 print "
" + 'Getting ' + row [ 1 ] + '... ' begin xd = Net :: HTTP . get ( row [ 1 ], '/crossdomain.xml' ) rescue counters [ 'unconnect' ] += 1 print 'unable to connect' next end begin xd = REXML :: Document . new ( xd ) rescue counters [ 'invalid-404' ] += 1 print 'invalid xml' next end wildcard_access = false XPath . each ( xd , '//allow-access-from' ) do | access | next unless access . attributes [ 'domain' ] == '*' # <allow-access-from domain="*"> wildcard_access = true counters [ 'permissive' ] += 1 print 'permissive' permissive << row break end unless wildcard_access counters [ 'secure' ] += 1 print 'secure' end end print counters . inspect
The Results
After 160,169 websites were inspected over the course of a few days, the script hung.
3,535 (2.2%) of the websites were down at the time of the scan.
84,883 (53%) of the websites had invalid or non-existent XML files at /crossdomain.xml.
67,097 (41.9%) of the websites surveyed had a “secure” crossdomain.xml file.
4,653 (2.9%) of the websites surveyed had insecure crossdomain.xml files.
A wildcard crossdomain.xml file is fine for certain websites, but a quick scan of the results reveals a number of banks, bitcoin websites, and popular entertainment sites (9gag and Vimeo included) with poor crossdomain.xml files. The results as a CSV with columns corresponding to the Alexa rank and the domain name.
Although a full scan of the Alexa top million was not completed, an alarmingly large number of sites have overly permissive and insecure crossdomain.xml files.
“I think he wanted to toss me off the cliff.” Mark L. Smith on The Revenant and Martyrs
Mark L. Smith discusses long development periods, how he took a special approach to writing The Revenant, and what appeals to him about stories of survivors.
By Christopher McKittrick.
For screenwriter Mark L. Smith, patience has paid off. After not having one of his credited screenplays produced since 2009's The Hole, two films he wrote have been released recently. The Revenant, one of the most acclaimed drama of 2015, and Martyrs, a remake of the French horror movie that debuted at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival.
Both The Revenant and Martyrs are screenplays that are several years old. Smith wrote the first draft of The Revenant in 2010, and he wrote the script for Martyrs shortly after writing Vacancy, the 2007 horror movie directed by Nimród Antal. In the case of The Revenant, Smith substantially rewrote the script with Oscar-winning director and screenwriter Alejandro González Iñárritu once Iñárritu and star Leonardo DiCaprio decided to make the film. The Revenant is now nominated for 12 Oscars, including Best Picture.
Both films put their protagonists through the wringers. In The Revenant, DiCaprio portrays Hugh Glass, a real-life trapper on the American frontier who was nearly killed by a bear attack. When his half-Native American son refuses to abandon him, Glass' colleague Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) murders Glass' son and leaves Glass for dead. Close to death, Glass refuses to expire until he can get vengeance on Fitzgerald.
In Martyrs, Lucie and Sarah are two young girls who meet in an orphanage. Lucie is haunted by memories of being physically abused, and when she reaches adulthood she proceeds to hunt down those responsible. However, when Sarah comes after her she learns that Lucie's abusers are part of a sinister scheme of biblical proportions.
Creative Screenwriting spoke to Smith about the long development period for both films, how he took a special approach to writing The Revenant because it was written on spec, and what appeals to him about stories about survivors.
The script for The Revenant went through many drafts over many years and saw a number of lead actors and directors attached. How did it change from draft to draft?
Actually it changed very little, believe it or not. Once Leo came aboard with Alejandro the larger changes happened. Up until that point from 2007 to 2010, the changes were very subtle things. The initial draft was written for Samuel L. Jackson, so the lead character was going to be African American. Obviously that is a different version, and some of the racism played into that.
After that it remained very close to the original. I sponged off some smart things that directors and actors had to say along the way, and I would tweak it based on notes or thoughts that I liked. That influenced some subtle changes.
The screenplay I read was dated August 2010. I was struck by how detailed your descriptions are. In particular, I was really impressed with how detailed the bear attack scene was. Did you go into detail because of the script's limited dialogue?
Exactly. Knowing that it was almost like a silent film in a lot of ways, I knew that I couldn't waste any words for the actions and the visuals. I needed it to all jump out for readers because early on I was writing it as a spec.
I had to make sure that the readers were into it, turning the page, following the story, and understanding that they weren't going to get exposition through dialogue. I didn't want them to miss people talking, so I got very detailed and I felt everything had to be super visual to pop off the page in order to keep them interested. That was the big challenge.
It wasn't a thing where I could just write, “And now the bear attacks Hugh Glass and they have this epic fight.” I felt that the movie had to be there so that the reader could have a visceral reaction to the words.
I interviewed Alejandro's three Birdman co-writers and they referred to him a few times as a “madman.” Based on your time working with him, would you agree with that label?
[Laughs] You'll hear different versions from different people, but we got along so well. He had this very specific point of view and I would adjust to that.
Maybe he's a mad genius. “Genius” is a word I rarely use and I don't really like it that much, but I give people that label when they can see things that no one else can see. He would have some ideas and I would say, “Alejandro, we can't pull this off. It's not going to work,” and he would say, “Mark, trust me, we can do this.”
In the end, he was right. That to me is the greatest compliment I can give someone. The same thing happened during production whenever they were struggling with fighting the weather and the elements. He has such a clear vision of exactly what he wanted and then he makes it happen.
Speaking of that struggling, the often-repeated narrative about this movie is how difficult the shoot was. When you were writing a script with material this intense, were you ever concerned that it might have been too difficult to film, which could have prevented it from being produced, or do you just focus on writing the best script you possibly can regardless?
I write the story that I feel is the absolute best version of every scene, and then you let the experts figure out how to pull it off. I was on set one day and talking to some of the stunt guys about a very intricate stunt that they were trying to pull off involving some of the Arikara warriors scaling the cliffs with the river going by. It was huge and took a few days. I leaned over and told the guy, “Yeah, I wrote this thing in like fifteen minutes.” I think he wanted to toss me off the cliff.
Writers can create from the warmth of our desks and the real amazing guys are the ones who have to pull it off. My job is to make sure that the words on the page really grab people, and it's on the other people to pull it off. With The Revenant everyone was just incredible, and I think it shows. Sometimes it doesn't come through like that. It's always a little bit of a crapshoot.
While the main story of The Revenant focuses on Glass, I was engaged by the relationship between the white and Native American characters. There is one Native American character who says to the French, “You all have stolen everything from us.” That parallels Glass' conflict with Fitzgerald as well. Could you say anything regarding that?
Since my earliest drafts this was always a parent-child story at the base of it. The revenge and the betrayal would kick-start it and that would light the journey, but that was the emotion that started it.
With the Native American characters we were trying to show the humanity of both sides and how similar they are even though the cultures were so different. On a battlefield Glass and the Arikara chief would be fighting to the death, but here we see them both in pursuit of their children, in a way. Glass' journey is built all around the murder of his son and what he's trying to get back from that and the Akira chief is trying to find his daughter. They are parallel journeys and they are very similar men in a lot of ways, but they're perceived so differently.
We tried to hit on that and tried to show the struggle that the Native Americans saw with these people pouring over their land and devouring what they lived off of to profit from it. It was a very different point of view.
It's even shown in the opening setup during the battle. Glass is racing through, trying to save people by getting them into the boat and telling them to leave the pelts, then the camera pans across and there's Fitzgerald yelling to grab the pelts. Immediately you see the two different perspectives of those characters in that world and what's important to them. It's a subtle thing and a lot of people don't necessarily catch the differences between the two men during that battle, but it's already planted there.
Another small character moment that demonstrates the common humanity is when Glass and Hikuc are catching snowflakes in the mouths.
That scene was actually Alejandro's idea. It was a way to have a bonding moment and a little glimpse of what I had in my earlier drafts. There was more lightness in my script and a few more smiles, but those got pulled for different reasons – a lot of them for good reasons.
But Alejandro put that in to replace some of that so you could see two men who were similar. It's just like two friends who are very different men that are sharing this world together. I love that moment. It was one of those scenes that when Alejandro was talking about it I wondered if we could get away with it, and then whenever I saw it on screen it became one of my favorite sequences.
Moving on to Martyrs, what about the original French version of Martyrs appealed to you?
I wrote the script after I sold Vacancy. What attracted me to it is that I'm not a lover of violence. Even when I wrote Vacancy I was trying to put those characters in a very violent world but not really show the violence.
What I was attracted to with Martyrs was how the relationship between the two girls started at a young age, and what you're willing to do for your best friend. The characters in that story are what really drew me to it.
We made a big change from the original in the midpoint in order to sustain that relationship. In the midpoint of the original, the main character [Lucie] kills herself. This version became less about watching someone be tortured and more about trying to save a friend.
I tried to stay away from all the violence and keep it off-screen, which was kind of the polar opposite of the original. I know a lot of people love it, but that isn't what I wanted to do. I think people are probably right when they say it's “Americanized.” The cultures are different to some extent, but it's more just my taste. I'm not saying it's not the right taste, it's just my taste.
Both Martyrs and The Revenant are stories of survival, as is Vacancy. In fact, the leads of all three films seem to follow the advice of Glass' wife – “As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight. You breathe… keep breathing.” Does anything in particular draw you to survival stories?
It's funny, I haven't really thought about that but you're right. I think there is something about that – the desperation, the will to survive, what we're able to overcome whether it's to survive or to protect or avenge someone – that interests me and I'm tapping into that. Now that you mention it, there are a few other things that I've written that have that same theme going on! [Laughs]
I have to admit that I'm drawn to films and stories with less technology. I love the idea of Man vs. Nature in The Revenant and the world without the use of cell phones, Siri, GPS, and all the modern things we can use. I like that in Vacancy as well where everything was stripped away. Then you're really getting into the character. You're watching people dig deep to use whatever they have within them to survive.
I love The Grey. I just love that film. For me it just comes down to character. You often find great characters in those kinds of stories. The narrative doesn't rely on outside elements to help. Man on Fire is another favorite of mine where you're watching a character dig from the depths to go after something that was important and to stay alive. I really do feel that all stems from character.
I wrote Endurance, which DiCaprio is a producer on, and it's about Ernest Shackleton's journey to the South Pole when his ship became stuck. Again, it's Shackleton and his crew trying to survive and last every day until they can figure a way out. It allows you to bring out the best in a character. Or the worst in some ways, because I feel it's important to tap into both angles.

Could Brooklyn become the future home of the Islanders?
Brett Yormark, CEO of the Barclays Center, confirmed to Newsday that the new arena being built in Brooklyn will have an ice rink that can support a professional hockey team.
"Due to the venue's design, the capacity for hockey would be a few thousand seats less than for basketball," Yormark said in an email to Newsday. "While we hope to explore hockey opportunities in the future, our primary focus at the moment is to build the best sports and entertainment venue in the world."
Voters in a suburban New York community, already paying some of the highest property taxes in the country, overwhelmingly rejected a referendum Monday to borrow $400 million for the construction of a new hockey arena and ballpark. With 99 percent of the vote counted, the referendum failed 56 percent to 43 percent, according to unofficial returns from the Nassau County Board of Elections.
Supporters of the referendum called it a last-ditch effort to keep the Islanders playing in the Nassau Coliseum. The team's lease expires in 2015, and the hockey team's owner, Charles Wang, has hinted he may have to move the team off Long Island unless a new facility is built to replace the 39-year-old building.
The Barclays Center will hold 18,000 for basketball, according to New York Post. Nassau Coliseum seats 16,234, while the smallest arena in the NHL will be the Winnipeg Jets' home (15,015 seats).
The Barclays Center will become home to the NBA's New Jersey Nets when it opens in September 2012. A spokesman for Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov told NetsDaily he is not interested in buying the Islanders: "As before, [he has] no interest in pursuing the purchase of another sports team at this time."
Prokhorov owns 45 percent of the Barclays Center.

Why should lesbians, gays and bisexuals stand together with trans people? “Because we get beaten up by the same people!” Sometimes the best explanations are the simplest: this one came from an audience member at a talk given by trans writer and activist Juliet Jacques. Having common enemies provides the potential foundation for solidarity even among the most disparate of groups. “An injury to one is an injury to all” has long been the mantra of the labour movement, but it's applicable to all struggles. And yet the LGBT movement has long been without its T in practice, leaving trans people marginalised, ignored and even reviled.
Here is one of history's little tragic ironies. The iconic Stonewall riots of 1969 that did so much to galvanise the gay rights movement were dominated by trans people. “It was mostly a trans riot,” says longstanding trans activist Roz Kaveney. But trans people would find themselves often driven out of the movement. Late trans activist Sylvia Rivera was there at the Stonewall riots, but in 1973 there was a determined effort to yell her down at a gay rights Christopher Street Liberation Day rally. Perversely, when Britain's pre-eminent gay rights charity, Stonewall, was founded in 1989, it was named in homage to the riots, but refused to fight for transgender people.
Stonewall to start campaigning for trans equality Read more
Stonewall's belated but extremely welcome embrace of trans rights is therefore a historic moment for the LGBT movement. It spent several months listening to trans people, and has now apologised for excluding their sisters and brothers. Over the next year-and-a-half it plans to integrate trans people and trans issues. Ruth Hunt from the charity is very concerned that Stonewall should not seize ownership of trans concerns, but the organisation's work on everything from education to the workplace to guidance will be made trans inclusive. “The most important thing about recognition by Stonewall is that people will take us seriously, and our concerns seriously,” Kaveney says. “It gives us more clout, and shows trans people are worthy of respect.”
Why has the gay rights movement been so rubbish when it comes to trans issues? It is certainly the case that the barriers have not all been erected by LGB people. “There is bigotry on both sides,” suggests trans writer Paris Lees. “You get trans people saying, ‘I'm not homosexual you know, I've got a medical condition', and gay people going on about ‘cross dressers and perverts'.” Hunt points out that a minority of trans people object to the Stonewall move on the grounds that they believe it should be them running their organisation.
But there are other reasons, and that should lead to some reflection and self-criticism by people like me. I have written columns on all sorts of topics – hell, I've even written about the merits of cycling helmets – but this is the first time I've ever written about trans issues. Neglected by mainstream movements, trans rights have also failed to receive the attention they deserve from all sorts of progressively minded people.
To end violence against trans people, the police must stop perpetuating it Read more
The other reason is more straightforward and deeply troubling. Transphobia is not confined to knuckle-dragging bigots; it contaminates the thinking of some progressives. A recent article objects to an ideology whose “core … is the assertion ‘trans women are women'.” There was a “discussion to be had” over whether trans people are “a social category”, but “trans women are not, by definition, biological females.” This was published in the New Statesman, a left-of-centre publication. It is my firm belief that in generations to come we will look back at such commentary as we do now on discussions of women, gays and black people in the magazines of the 1950s.
There will be those who do not believe that it is for a man to intervene in a debate within feminism. This is a nonsense, of course: as I expect straight people to speak out against homophobia, non-trans people need to stand in solidarity with trans people, too. Indeed – as we have established – as a gay man I share many of the same enemies. And we know where these sentiments all lead. In Florida, the Republican state representative Frank Artiles is advocating legislation that would compel trans people to use toilets assigned to their original “biological sex”. What does that mean in practice? “If you can't use the right toilet, you can't function in society,” Kaveney points out. “You can't have a job, you can't have an education.”
Having common enemies provides solidarity even among the most disparate of groups
There are all too many trans causes to champion. Trans people are murdered for who they are: more than 200 were killed across the world last year, with deaths ranging from stoning to being beaten to being burned alive. And then there is mental distress. One survey last year found that a staggering 48% of young trans people had attempted suicide, and 59% had at least considered it. A 2013 study in the US found that trans people are far more likely to suffer from poverty and unemployment, and research in Britain has uncovered similar findings.
It is estimated that around half of Britain's 28,000 trans students have contemplated abandoning their courses, and a third have faced being bullied or harassed. These are all damning indictments of a transphobic society. Stonewall has now added its considerable voice to addressing them; others must follow its lead.

But these issues aren't taken seriously enough because even some progressives are debating the legitimacy of trans identity. There is the sense that they are interlopers, infiltrators, sufferers of psychological conditions rather than people trapped in the wrong bodies. In truth, debates over the latest scientific research are of little interest to me: what matters is that the happiness, security and even lives of a minority are at stake, and all too little has been done about it.
The cause of trans people has been neglected for too long by too many gay rights activists, feminists and progressives. It is a mistake that I myself have made. Now that Stonewall has embraced its trans sisters and brothers, it is a mistake that I hope I and many others will finally address. After all, I owe many of my own rights to the courage and sacrifice of trans people. The least I can do is to support them back.
Van Eck phreaking is a form of eavesdropping in which special equipment is used to pick up side-band electromagnetic emissions from electronics devices that correlate to hidden signals or data for the purpose of recreating these signals or data in order to spy on the electronic device. Side-band electromagnetic radiation emissions are present in and, with the proper equipment, can be captured from keyboards, computer displays, printers, and other electronic devices. In 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set. As a consequence of this research, such emanations are sometimes called "van Eck radiation", and the eavesdropping technique van Eck phreaking. Although government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet. (24 metres)[1] Additionally the NSA published Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency (Classified) on February 1, 1982. In addition, the van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s. While Phreaking is the process of exploiting telephone networks, it is used here because of its connection to eavesdropping. Van Eck phreaking of CRT displays is the process of eavesdropping on the contents of a CRT by detecting its electromagnetic emissions. Contents
Basic principle Edit
Potential Risks Edit
Van Eck phreaking might also be used to compromise the secrecy of the votes in an election using electronic voting. This caused the Dutch government to ban the use of NewVote computer voting machines manufactured by SDU in the 2006 national elections, under the belief that ballot information might not be kept secret.[11][12] In a 2009 test of electronic voting systems in Brazil, Van Eck phreaking was used to successfully compromise ballot secrecy as a proof of concept.[13]
Further Research Edit
Markus Kuhn has discovered several low-cost techniques for reducing the chances that emanations from computer displays can be monitored remotely.[14] With CRT displays and analog video cables, filtering out high-frequency components from fonts before rendering them on a computer screen will attenuate the energy at which text characters are broadcast. With modern flat panel displays, the high-speed digital serial interface (DVI) cables from the graphics controller are a main source of compromising emanations. Adding random noise to the least significant bits of pixel values may render the emanations from flat-panel displays unintelligible to eavesdroppers but is not a secure method. Since DVI uses a certain bit code scheme that tries to transport a balanced signal of 0 bits and 1 bits, there may not be much difference between two pixel colors that differ very much in their color or intensity. The emanations can differ drastically even if only the last bit of a pixel's color is changed. The signal received by the eavesdropper also depends on the frequency where the emanations are detected. The signal can be received on many frequencies at once and each frequency's signal differs in contrast and brightness related to a certain color on the screen. Usually, the technique of smothering the RED signal with noise is not effective unless the power of the noise is sufficient to drive the eavesdropper's receiver into saturation thus overwhelming the receiver input.

A Muslim cleric in Uganda has vowed to fight anyone who stands in the way of a potential new anti-gay bill being passed.
Sheikh Nuhu Mazaata brought up the subject while addressing prayers at at mosque in Kampala, saying that anyone defend LGBTI people will face a ‘rough' time.
He said: ‘We shall make those legislators who support homosexuality to do it in front of everyone to prove that what they are doing is right.
‘Those pro-homosexuality legislators need to be punished'.
Despite this, Mazaata also called on other religious leaders not to get involved in politics. Referring to the arrest of Uganda opposition leader Kizza Besigye, he said: ‘We were told not to interfere with political issues and indeed we should leave them to politicians.'
Uganda is notorious for its dangerous rhetoric against LGBTI people.
In 2014, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni signed the infamous Anti-Homosexuality Bill into law, which called for tough penalties for homosexual acts, and encouraged members of the public to report LGBTI people to the authorities.
However, the courts in Uganda were later able to invalidate the law on the grounds of a technicality.
Despite this, the situation for LGBTI Ugandans remains dire, with activists believing the situation will get worse in the near future.

The Egyptian military has claimed that it killed the leader of the Sinai branch of Islamic State, suspected of downing a Russian passenger jet over Sinai in October last year.
Abu Duaa al-Ansari, the leader of the ISIS Sinai Peninsula terror group, was killed in northern Sinai, south of the coastal city of el-Arish, Egyptian officials said on Thursday.
A Facebook post on the page of Egyptian military's spokesperson claimed that “accurate intelligence” allowed security forces to kill the jihadist.
Fox News cited intelligence sources confirming the killing of al-Ansari in a targeted airstrike.
The outlet reported the man had actively been involved in organizing attacks against the UN personnel on Sinai Peninsula.

The Egyptian military added that 45 members of the group were also eliminated during the operation.
The Egyptian branch of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) is suspected by the CIA of planting a bomb on the Russian Metrojet passenger plane that crashed on October 31, 2015, killing all 224 people on board.
The Metrojet Airbus A321 was en route from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg when an explosion destroyed the plane in the air.The chief of the Russian intelligence services later confirmed it was a terrorist act.
The IS Sinai branch, formerly known as Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, launched numerous deadly attacks targeting both civilians and security personnel on Sinai.
Among the most known is the assault in March this year when gunmen, carrying an IS flag opened fire at tourists in Red Sea resort of Hurghada, injuring at least two.
In January 2015, Sinai Province launched a full-scale assault on army and police positions on the peninsula using car bombs and mortars. The outbreak of violence saw some 26 law security personnel killed and over forty injured.
In November 2015 the militants attacked a hotel in the northern Sinai, leaving seven people dead.
The vicious attacks by the jihadists led to an ongoing military operation against them launched by Egyptian military in September 2015.
This is going to be a long comparison consisting of 5 bras. I intally wanted to do 2 or 3 bras, but with some of the altered bras, I'm not 100% sure what alterations were done. I will have pictures and measurements, so this will be a long post. There will be pictures of how I measured the bras, for your information.
Bras:
Rita 70F- Unaltered aside from the fact it is a 3HC
Annika 65G- reduced gore (possibly reduced cup)
Snake 65G- reduced gore* (possibly reduced cup and straps moved in)
Veronique 65G- reduced gore, reduced cup and straps moved in
Basic 70F- reduced gore, reduced cup and straps moved in
For all intents and purposes the Veronique and the Basic are to be considered completely altered, and the Annika and the Snake are considered somewhat altered. I can't say with 100% certainty that any alterations aside from rom the reduced gore were done on the Annika and the Snake, or if they were altered by 1 cm instead of 2. Anyone that has ordered from Comexim knows that they don't really confirm whether or not they will do or have done an alteration. So hopefully this will help someone.
Fit wise the Rita is the cup that is the most open on me, and it actually has a bit of room at the top. The basic is the cup that is the smallest on me with The Veronique closely following. I'm not sure if I've ever mentioned this, but to be completely honest, I'd want all of my bras to be as low as the basic. I know that it looks too small, (well ittoo small), but that's the height that I would like for bras. Seeing as how I have tall roots, I have no issue with taller cups.
*I know all the bra except for the Rita lol too small in the cups, but my breasts settle after a while.
Top of the cup:
Rita 6.5 inches
Annika 6.25 inches
Snake 6 inches
Veronique 5.75 inches
Basic 5.875 inches
Thoughts : The Rita is a little too open on top for me. The basic doesn't have the smallest measurement, which is why there isn't a lot of quadding. I do want to mention that the Annika is supposed to have a copper ribbon at the top, I requested that my bra not have that ribbon because I don't really like the color.
Width:
Rita 5 inches
Annika 5 inches
Snake 5 inches
Veronique 5.25 inches
Basic 5 inches
Thoughts: I'm not sure why, but I'm surprised to see that the width is pretty much the same for all the bras. Theoretically since they're either the same size or sister size, it should be the same. But it goes to show that just because a cup is altered, the width still stays the same.
Depth:
Rita 8 inches
Annika 7.75 inches
Snake 7.5 inches
Veronique 8 inches
Basic 8 inches
Thoughts: It's interesting to see that the depth on the Snake is the smallest, and that the Veronique, Rita and basic all have the same depth. I would have expected the depth of the basic to be less than the other bras, since it seems a lot smaller while on.
Cup height:
Rita 6.25 inches
Annika 5 inches
Snake 5 inches
Veronique 5 inches
Basic 5 inches
Thoughts: this was measured near the outer seam of the 3HC. All of the bras except the Rita have the same measurement. The Rita is 1.125 inches taller than the rest, so this can account for why the Rita seems a little too big
Gore:
Rita 2.75 inches
Annika 2.25 inches
Snake 2.75 inches
Veronique 2.25 inches
Basic 2.125 inches
Thoughts : the gore on both the Rita and Snake bras can be considered unaltered. I definitely asked for a reduced gore on the snake bra, so it wasn't done. 2.75 inches is the height of the gore on my unaltered 65Gs/70Fs.
Strap to wire:
Rita 2 inches
Annika 2 inches
Snake 2.125 inches
Veronique 2.5 inches
Basic 2.375 inches
Thoughts : I'm guessing this is what matters most to the people that need the straps moved in, because as you can see, the area is larger on the very altered bras and smaller on the unaltered. I don't have narrow or sloping shoulders, so moving the straps in, isn't a necessary alteration for me.
Seam to seam (top):
Rita 1.5 inches
Annika 2 inches
Snake 1.75 inches
Veronique 1.75 inches
Basic 1.75 inches
Thoughts : I'm not sure if this measurement will help anyone with anything, but it is interesting to me that the Rita has the smallest measurement, and the Annika has the largest.
Seam to seam (bottom):
Rita 1.125 inches
Annika 1.125 inches
Snake 1.25 inches
Veronique 1.125-1.25 inches
Basic 1.125 inches
Thoughts : I'm not sure if this measurement will help anyone with anything, but it is interesting to see that the measurements are almost the same.
Actual comparisons of the bras:
So hopefully this post has helped someone when they're deciding whether to try an unaltered or altered Comexim 3 piece halfcup. If you get nothing out of this post, just know that Comexim will reduce the cup on a 3HC (and that reduction does not come from the middle of the cup.

WE all love to whinge about the state of our roads and the size of the potholes, but one man took it upon himself to do something about it.
But after three years of voluntary community service, the artist known as Roa Dart is hanging up his spray cans.
NO MORE: Roa Dart will stop painting around the potholes on our Northern Rivers roads and pursue other artistic endeavours. Mireille Merlet-Shaw
He has probably saved the community tens of thousands of dollars in repairs and may have saved lives through avoided accidents, but for reasons that are his and his alone, Roa Dart will paint our roads no more.
Roa (not his real name) told The Northern Star that he had put his "life on hold" to paint the roads and for most of that time he had "loved what (he) was doing", but after some "negativity" and possibly some financial stress he has decided it's time to move on.
"I've shown it can be done, and I'm not in jail... It's come from the heart and the love I've felt from people has been overwhelming at times."
He has established donation collection spots around the Lismore local government area (his main canvas), but it generally doesn't cover the $100 plus he spends on paint each week.
Roa said pothole painting is not for the faint hearted and he has had many near-death experiences over the years.
He always wears high visibility clothing, but his work is not sanctioned by councils or Roads and Maritime Services.
"I don't have a fear of death. Four-wheel drives will go past at 100kmh. It's not something I can just hand over to somebody... It's a spiritual thing. It makes you appreciate the life you have.
"Your awareness is heightened. My main concern is always listening for cars coming... but the reality of it is it's a dangerous situation."
Roa is also responsible for putting brightly coloured love hearts around Lismore, which he says he will continue to do "forever" while also pursuing other artistic endeavours.
Brendan Schaub used to date Ronda Rousey. During his latest podcast, he spoke about his ex and current UFC women's champ dating Travis Browne, who also happens to be a former opponent that's currently accused of domestic violence.
"It's tough when you're like, uh don't be a do nothing bitch and you hate on Mayweather, and then your boyfriend's over here beating the shit out of his wife," Schaub states. "And not to mention, he's still married. So it's tough when you're a role model."
It is important to note that while a short clip (h/t r/MMA) with this specific statement has been circulating the web, those who missed it live will have to wait until the episode is released for the full context of his statements. It is also not uncommon for sensitive topics and statements like these to be cut out, although Schaub himself says the episode won't be edited down. [UPDATE: It was cut out of the episode]

That said, having those contradictions (if true) really does make it tough to be a role model that everyone makes her out to be. People have also brought up other inconsistencies, like how DNB is used for body image issues, but she (and Dana White) had criticized Cris Cyborg for not looking like a woman. Fair or not, even if Rousey never wanted that role, she has already been thrust in that position and these don't help.
Fight Hub TV: Floyd Mayweather Sr. discusses Ronda Rousey's feud with his son
Governor Scott Walker (R-WI), already well known for his efforts to curb union power, has now set out to tackle an equally big task: busting the higher education bubble.
The problem of college affordability is recognized on both sides of the aisle, but sadly, most efforts to abate the problem – such as increasing federal subsidies – have only exacerbated it. Walker wants to try a different approach for taxpayers and students in his state.
Last Tuesday, Walker released his proposal to create the University of Wisconsin Flexible Degree Program, a competency-based approach using both online learning and traditional college courses. He explained:
This unique competency-based model will allow students to start classes anytime they like, work at their own pace, and earn credit for what they already know… Students can use knowledge obtained on the job, through free open courseware, or anywhere else to quickly test out of a module or a course. A student may move ahead as soon as he or she can prove content mastery.
Obtaining a degree through the University of Wisconsin system will now be more affordable and customizable. By tapping into and giving credit for the knowledge a student has obtained outside the classroom or through another school, the Flexible Degree Program brings down the cost and the time required to graduate. If a student proves his mastery of a certain subject, he can obtain credit without taking a full class. Walker's office notes:
Students can demonstrate college-level competencies – no matter where they learned the material – as soon as they can prove that they know it… Rather than molding coursework around a set timeframe, these modules can be designed to contain only the knowledge required within a specific competency. This could benefit working adults who need to start and pause their studies because of work and personal commitments. It could also benefit highly motivated students who are able to move through course materials at a faster pace. Courses in this new program will be based on competency, not seat time, so students can move on to the next topic when they have mastered the current material. Students will have broad access to high quality coursework and student services, and they can graduate as soon as they can prove their mastery of the material… Students with extensive knowledge from the workplace, free open courseware, or other life experiences will be able to quickly move closer to degree completion by having their knowledge assessed and credited.
The classes can also be tailored to allow for a student's busy schedule or career goals. What's more, Walker expects the program to reach even international students, broadening the university's student and revenue base.
Governor Walker, as was the case with his efforts to curb union influence and empower teachers, is on the cutting edge of a higher education revolution. As Heritage's Stuart Butler notes:
In as little as a decade, most colleges and universities could look very different from their present forms – with the cost of a college credential plummeting even as the quality of instruction rises. If this transformation does come to pass, it could have profound and beneficial implications. It could significantly increase the international competitiveness of American workers in a world in which we need higher skills and productivity to compete. It could sharply improve the employability of those on the bottom rungs of America's income ladder, giving them the tools they need to move up. And it could do much to restore the American Dream for those who have begun to believe that opportunity in this country is disappearing. In other words, such a change could hardly come too soon.
Walker's plan is a real solution to the problem of college affordability, cutting costs for the student and the taxpayer. The first-in-the-nation Flexible Degree Program is a great step toward giving all students their chance at the American Dream.

I had quite a hard time tracking down the correct trim and molding pieces for the 1962 Galaxie project. Since the car didn't have any of the trim and molding when I purchased it, I had to use the power of the internet to locate pictures of other Galaxies to figure out what the correct trim looked like. Then, I used eBay to purchase all of the correct pieces. Lastly, I need to figure out what the correct trim and molding clips looked like so I could start to find them as well.
Here's I've got all the the wheel well trim and rocker panel molding installed on the car. These pieces are pretty straight forward to install, but the side bold molding was giving me issues. Here are the clips that came on the old trim pieces.
I quickly determined these were not the correct clips. I suspect these are old-style clips to a 40s Ford.
I found the correct clips from Dennis-Carpenter, and I'm just waiting for them to arrive so I can install the molding on the car. There are only a few other pieces of trim that need to be installed on the car to finish out the trim and molding pieces:
Here is the rear quarter molding.
Here is the fender trim molding.
And here is the rear finish panels.
I am really happy how the wheel well trim and rocker panel molding turned out. Let me know if you have any questions about how this trim goes on and I would be happy to help!

A recent paper identified genes that changed their expression as a result of music performance in trained musicians. (see citation below). There were a surprising number of affected genes, 51 genes had increased and 22 had decreased expression, compared to controls who were also trained musicians but were not involved in making or listening to music for the same time period. It is also impressive that this set of 73 genes has a very broad range of presumed functions and effects in the brain.
Another interesting aspect is the overlap of a number of these genes with some that have been identified in song birds. This implies that the music/sophisticated sound perception and production has been conserved from a common ancestor of birds and mammals.
It has been known for some time that musical training has a positive effect on intelligence and outlook – that it assists learning. Musical training changes the structure of the brain. Now scientists are starting to trace the biology of music's effects. Isn't it about time that education stopped treating music (and other arts for that matter) as unimportant frills? It should not be the first thing to go when money or teaching time is short.
Here is the Abstract:
“Music performance by professional musicians involves a wide-spectrum of cognitive and multi-sensory motor skills, whose biological basis is unknown. Several neuroscientific studies have demonstrated that the brains of professional musicians and non-musicians differ structurally and functionally and that musical training enhances cognition. However, the molecules and molecular mechanisms involved in music performance remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the effect of music performance on the genome-wide peripheral blood transcriptome of professional musicians by analyzing the transcriptional responses after a 2-hr concert performance and after a ‘music-free' control session. The up-regulated genes were found to affect dopaminergic neurotransmission, motor behavior, neuronal plasticity, and neurocognitive functions including learning and memory. Particularly, candidate genes such as SNCA, FOS and DUSP1 that are involved in song perception and production in songbirds, were identified, suggesting an evolutionary conservation in biological processes related to sound perception/production. Additionally, modulation of genes related to calcium ion homeostasis, iron ion homeostasis, glutathione metabolism, and several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases implied that music performance may affect the biological pathways that are otherwise essential for the proper maintenance of neuronal function and survival. For the first time, this study provides evidence for the candidate genes and molecular mechanisms underlying music performance.”

“What's unusual about this case and that people don't expect is that the victim in this case was a male,” Fu said. “He was larger than his wife. He was a robust man. But victims of domestic violence come in all shapes and sizes. They come from all walks of life. And the point we hope every family takes from this story is that no matter where you come from, when you come in our door, all victims of crime are deserving of the same justice that the system can offer.”
Fu said he hopes the sentence will show the community that prosecutors and law enforcement advocate for victims of domestic violence.
She said after the sentencing that the defense is disappointed with the result of the case but declined further comment.
“Though Judy was involved in an isolated violent incident, it is undisputed that Judy posts no threat to the community,” O'Neil wrote.
O'Neil filed a memorandum on Monday asking that Musseman exercise discretion in his sentencing. In the document, she argued Judith Nix's life experiences made her “particularly vulnerable” to abusive relationships such as the one she had with Kenneth Nix.
“This was not a clear-cut, cold-blooded kind of circumstance,” she said. “There are a lot of nuances to this case.”
Judith Nix's attorney, Nora O'Neil, told Musseman on Wednesday that any term of incarceration is in effect a death sentence because of Judith Nix's age. She would not be eligible for parole until age 108, O'Neil said.
“I became a grandpa and my dad would have been a great-grandpa the same day that he was murdered,” he said. “I sent a text to my father telling him he was getting ready to be a great-grandpa, then … I found out he went to heaven on the same day Abigail Grace was born.”
Kevin Nix said the last text message he sent to his father, which did not get a response, was on the day he died. He described him as a good father and businessman, and said he wished he could have told the jury about him.
Kevin Nix noted that his former stepmother did not call for help until more than 12 hours after the shooting. Judith Nix called 911 to report Kenneth Nix had died and said it appeared as though he had committed suicide.
“My sister and my ex-stepsisters will all be able to go visit her in jail or prison,” he told reporters, referencing family members who supported Judith Nix. “I will never be able to visit my father or ever be able to talk to him again.”
Kenneth Nix's oldest son, Kevin Nix, read a victim impact statement Wednesday in which he did not refer to Judith Nix by name. He said that although she sought compassion from the court, “I'd ask how much compassion the defendant had when she decided to take my father's life.”
Judith Nix, according to her defense team, had battered woman syndrome when she shot her ex-husband after he initiated an altercation with her that led to a struggle over control of his gun. But Fu and Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Elmore said text messages she exchanged with Pearson in the days before the shooting indicated she planned to hurt Kenneth Nix.
She was arrested March 22, 2016, when Broken Arrow police said there were inconsistencies between her account of how Kenneth Nix died, evidence at the scene and statements from her daughter Michel Pearson, who was arrested on an accessory complaint but not charged.
Jurors found Judith Nix guilty March 10 of killing Kenneth Nix by shooting him twice in the head, which prosecutors said occurred while he slept in his room.
“Although Ms. Nix is of advanced years, this is first-degree murder,” Fu said after the hearing. “Sometimes the one act you take in life … is heinous enough that it's deserving of the ultimate punishment, and in this case I think the jury made the right decision. We think the judge was respectful of that decision, and today justice was done.”
Assistant District Attorney Ben Fu, in successfully asking District Judge William Musseman to uphold the jury's sentencing recommendation, said Kenneth Nix was the victim of a “premeditated, cold-blooded act” of murder.
“I never ever wished (for) this to happen,” Judith Nix said.
She said she grieves daily over Kenneth Nix's death and her part in it but maintained, as her attorneys did during her trial, that it was difficult to balance her love for him with his increasingly unstable and violent behavior toward her.

26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.
28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.
29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.
31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.
32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:
33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
37 For with God nothing shall be impossible.
38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

Diana Nyad is a truly remarkable woman. She made four unsuccessful attempts to swim from Cuba to Florida, but persevered and actually accomplished her goal on the fifth try. Now Nyad just happens to be an atheist, and said so to Oprah Winfrey in an interview that aired on Sunday. And Nyad was very open and honest about her worldview and how she's able to appreciate the awe and the majesty of the earth despite her atheism.
But as far as Oprah is concerned, the mere fact that Nyad sees such wonder in the world is proof that she is not, in fact, an atheist.
Oprah is, without question, one of the most famous and influential people on the planet, and when she talks, people listen. Newsweek had a huge cover story in 2009 chronicling her influence on the alternative medicine racket. So that's why this exchange was particularly troublesome.
DIANA NYAD: I can stand at the beach's edge with the most devout Christian, Jew, Buddhist, go on down the line, and weep with the beauty of this universe and be moved by all of humanity, all the billions of people who lived before us, who have loved and hurt and suffered. To me, my definition of God is humanity and is the love of humanity. OPRAH: Well, I don't call you an atheist then. I think if you believe in the awe and the wonder and the mystery, then that is what God is.
This is not the first time Oprah has gone down this road, so to speak. When she was in Denmark, she admitted she was “puzzled' at how one of the happiest countries in the world could be the least religious. One of the women Oprah spoke to actually said the same thing that Nyad did, that she believes in humanity. Oprah seemed positively stunned by this, even suggesting she may be religious but just doesn't know it.
Oprah doesn't hate atheists or harbor an anti-atheist bias or anything like that; it's just hard for many religious people to wrap their heads around the idea that there are people who live happy lives without religious morality guiding it or the belief in a being watching over them 24/7.
Being awed at the world is not at all a religious notion. There is plenty of beauty to be found in the natural world, you don't need to believe there was a creator to be able to appreciate that. And when Oprah says this awe is what God is to her, that's perfectly fine, but she can't use her own belief system to tell someone that they are not who they say they are.
And by the way, for anyone who thinks all atheists are just a bunch of nasty trolls looking to mock and deride religious people any chance they get, watch this interview, because there are a lot of atheists out there like Diana Nyad, who are perfectly content with unbelief and don't begrudge others who believe in a supreme being.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly higher on Wednesday as investors digested mixed earnings reports, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped as bank stocks weighed.
The Nasdaq gained moderately to close at a record high for a second straight day, lifted by big tech names such as Facebook (FB.O) and Apple (AAPL.O).
Allergan (AGN.N) shares rose 3.7 percent after the drugmaker's fourth-quarter profit and revenue topped estimates. Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) shares tumbled 8.6 percent and were the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P after the biotech company's weak forecast for its hepatitis C medicines.
Major U.S. stock indexes are hovering around record highs after a rally following the Nov. 8 election of President Donald Trump amid expectations he will usher in fiscal stimulus and lower regulations and taxes.
Related Coverage Factbox: Company shares mostly able to recover from Trump tweets
But the rally has stagnated in recent days as investors await more details about Trump's potential economic policy agenda.
“Usually, this would be a period in which earnings and guidance drive the market,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
“But because it's the first three weeks or four weeks of a new president who is promoting radical change than what has been going on, Washington takes precedence, I think, over earnings in the eyes of investors these days.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 35.95 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,054.34, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.59 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,294.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 8.24 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,682.45.

Financials, which have soared since the election, were the worst-performing S&P sector, falling 0.8 percent. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) fell 0.8 percent, making it the biggest drag on the Dow, and JP Morgan (JPM.N) dropped 0.9 percent.
Bank stocks are sensitive to interest rate changes, and U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest levels in weeks.
The real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU sectors, which tend to perform well in low-rate environments, were the best performing groups.
“As the yield curve flattens, we're back to a very tough environment for financials,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “They live off the spread.”
With about two-thirds of the S&P 500 having reported results, fourth-quarter earnings are on track to have climbed 8.3 percent, which would be the best performance since the third quarter of 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In other corporate news, Nordstrom (JWN.N) shares rose 4.1 percent. Trump attacked the retailer on Twitter for dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing line.
About 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, similar to the daily average over the last 20 sessions.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.23-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and 51 new lows.
Does Hillary Clinton have a body double? Earlier today, Clinton set the news cycle on fire by experiencing some sort of “medical episode” while attending a ceremony for the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Very little video has surfaced showing Clinton's medical episode from today. The video below shows Clinton waiting for her vehicle and beginning to shake.
What exactly happened has been being debated on social media. CNN is reporting that Clinton was feeling overheated. Clinton then decided she was going to go to her daughter's apartment. Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill released a statement about Clinton's medical mishap.
“Secretary Clinton attended the September 11th Commemoration Ceremony for one hour and 30 minutes this morning to pay her respects and greet some of the families of the fallen. During the ceremony, she felt overheated so departed to go to her daughter's apartment, and is feeling much better.”
Shortly after noon is when the conspiracy theory begins. A video surfaced of Hillary Clinton leaving Chelsea Clinton's apartment. In the video, Clinton appears to be happy and healthy, stops for a photo with a child, and walks away.
Many people who saw this video on YouTube began to leave comments claiming that this person is not Hillary Clinton.
One commenter, Anna Bird, stated, “Earlier in the day at the 9-11 ceremony she had no dark roots showing, in this video (maybe lighting IDK) she has darker roots.”
A picture of Clinton that was taken prior to her medical episode can be found below for comparison.
YouTube user Jane Doe states, “NOT HER! Much skinnier, hand gestures different. This is a body double.”
Pictures of Clinton taken prior to her medical episode can be found below for comparison.
One of the most interesting parts of the video of the potential Clinton body double is the absence of anyone around her. All through her 2016 campaign, Clinton has always been surrounded by an entourage. The majority of the entourage are members of the Secret Service. No agents are seen with Clinton as she exits the apartment building. The following picture shows the potential body double without any of her entourage around her.
Update: Hillary Clinton “feeling great” after medical episode at 9/11 memorial service https://t.co/xiYJhSWoQi pic.twitter.com/PegqLaZDun — KTLA (@KTLA) September 11, 2016
Conspiracy theorists are stating that there is no need to protect this person because she is a body double. Would the Secret Service allow Clinton to be alone after what happened earlier in the day? Many people say no and that this body double was used to make it difficult for her health issues to be brought up during the remaining weeks of the 2016 campaign.
The use of a body double is a tactic that has been employed many times by world leaders throughout history. The actual term for using a body double like this is called political decoy. Some of the most famous leaders that used a body double include Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Saddam Hussein, and Osama Bin Laden. It is believed that Winston Churchill did not have a body double but a voice double.
Hillary Clinton's health issues have slowly started to become a focal point in the 2016 election cycle. Many people want her medical records to be released so that the voters can decide for themselves if they believe that Clinton is healthy enough to deal with the stress that the President of the United States faces every day.
What do you think? Is the person in the second video a body double of Hillary Clinton?

Today is a sad day that may irrevocably alter the vaping landscape in Indiana. HB 1432 Passed. The bill puts heavy restrictions on the use of vaping within the state. Fighting these types of laws is exactly why this site was created.
Some of the restrictions imposed per this bill:
Eliquid manufacturers must obtain a permit from the alcohol and tobacco commission before bottling e-liquid or selling e-liquid to retailers or distributors.
Manufacturing permit requires plans for the applicant's manufacturing facility and a security firm certification that the manufacturer meets security requirements.
Eliquid manufacturers must obtain permits, with an application fee of $1,000, and a permit renewal application fee of $500 after five years.
If not approved for permits, you may reapply within 30 days, past this the fees are non-refundable.
The criteria for approval include a childproof cap.
Punishes retailers who distribute e-liquid manufactured by a company without a permit.
No one listed on the permit can have a felony or an offense involving a controlled substance on record.
The State can conduct criminal background checks on people distributing e-liquid.
The manufacturer's facility must be subject to 24-hour video recording where e-liquid is mixed, bottled, packaged and stored.
Manufacturers will be subject to random audits of the facility and samples.
Batches must be indicated on the bottles label.
Three ten milliliter sample bottles from each batch of 2 liters or more must be saved for three years, secured in a location with video surveillance.
Home brewing of e-liquid (DIY) cannot be made for resale.
This is only a handful of requirements outlined by the bill. These standards will apply to manufacturers outside of the State of Indiana, so a liquid manufactured in another State would have to be subject to the same scrutiny set forth by Indiana to be sold there.
This bill also sets a dangerous precedent for the rest of the country, as the degree of restrictions asserted over e-liquid manufacturing in Indiana is literally unheard of in any industry.
This bill essentially enables Big Tobacco to be the only game in the state, as such stringent criteria is virtually impossible for small businesses to meet. This will undoubtedly keep more people smoking and is a win for big tobacco and big pharma.

The cutest photobomb EVER? Moment sloth gatecrashes jungle camp holiday snap
In these days of Photoshop trickery this picture purporting to show a sloth gatecrashing a holiday snap in the jungle looks too good to be true.
But that's exactly what youngsters on an International Student Volunteers expedition in Costa Rica claim happened right in front of their eyes.
In what looks like a scene from Madagascar, the cute critter lowered himself down into the frame as the group smiled for the camera - or at least so swears anthropologist Manuel Ramirez.
Claims: In these days of Photoshop trickery this picture purporting to show a sloth gatecrashing a holiday snap in the jungle may be too good to be true
The 44-year-old ISV tour guide said: 'There was a big group of us helping cut paths in the jungle.
'I thought it would be nice to take a group shot. As I looked through the camera lens I could see something creeping in to the frame.
'When I realised it was a baby sloth I clicked the button as fast as I could, not that he was going anywhere fast.
'I thought it was too good a picture opportunity and so rather than move I just took the picture with him in it.
Star of the show: The sloth pictured with the group shortly after it had reportedly 'photobombed' the group photograph
'It has become a bit of a talking point for everyone. None of us will ever forget the trip, especially when we look back at this picture.
'I'm glad we saw the sloth that day as he made us laugh when we were very tired. Now we can share this moment with all our friends.'
Young volunteers from across the world came together for the project to help cut paths in the dense woodland to allow researchers to get around.

MIAMI — An opportunity.
That's all the ragtag roster that was last season's Heat team wanted. And it's what this season's Heat roster has earned.
The names haven't changed much over this stretch, with 11 players returning from the 2016-17 roster that fell just one game short of making the playoffs. But this season's Heat team has bigger dreams and higher expectations than last year's thanks to roster continuity and a weakened Eastern Conference.
And those dreams and expectations are getting bigger as each day passes.
The 2017-18 NBA season is just a few days old and injuries have already altered the landscape of the league. In the East, it's the Gordon Hayward injury that has some teams in the conference wondering if they're now better than the Celtics.
Yes, the Heat are one of those teams and it's not an irrational thought.
[Erik Spoelstra says James Johnson's ascent to being named Heat captain ‘one most special things' in his career]
[Five takeaways: Behind Goran Dragic, Dion Waiters, Heat hold off the Indiana Pacers in home opener]
Miami entered the season with NBA analysts like TNT's Reggie Miller saying the Heat are “on the fringe of that fourth seed” behind Cleveland, Boston and Toronto. Others had the Heat competing with the Bucks for the fifth seed in the East with the Cavaliers, Celtics, Raptors and Wizards in front of them.
“I think everybody sees an opportunity,” Heat president Pat Riley said before the start of training camp. “I know we see an opportunity, because there isn't a Golden State in our conference, or a San Antonio or maybe a Houston or whoever might be more consistent. There are opportunities for us. And we're going to take advantage of that.”
The opportunity to finish as one of the East's top four teams is very real, with Boston now starting 19-year-old rookie Jayson Tatum and relying on Terry Rozier and Shane Larkin to play big minutes off its bench. But don't get it twisted, the Celtics are still talented with Kyrie Irving and Al Horford leading the way and Jaylen Brown emerging as a very capable and reliable player.
The point is, the opportunity is there.
“Absolutely, man. We take that serious,” Heat guard Wayne Ellington said after Saturday's win over the Pacers when asked about the goal of finishing as one of the top four teams in the East. “We take that very serious. We know the type of work we put in this offseason, everybody. We're coming together. Obviously we're going to continue to get better and better as the season goes on. But those are real goals that we have and we're serious about that.”
The Cavaliers are now the clear-cut No. 1 team in the Eastern Conference after Hayward's injury. Then there's a pretty big gap until you get to the next tier of teams that includes the Wizards, Raptors and Celtics.
That's where the Heat enters the picture. Miami, Milwaukee and Charlotte are in that third tier, and the gap between these three and that second tier isn't as big as you would think with Washington still looking to get past the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 1979 and Toronto making it past the second round of the playoffs just once in franchise history.
The Eastern Conference took a big step back this offseason when Indiana traded four-time All-Star Paul George to Oklahoma City, Chicago traded three-time All-Star Jimmy Butler to Minnesota and Paul Millsap left the Hawks to sign with the Nuggets in free agency. Those moves took the Pacers, Bulls and Hawks out of the playoff picture after they all advanced to the playoffs last season, and gave non-playoff teams like the Heat, Hornets, Pistons and 76ers some playoff hope.
Now, the Hayward injury has the Heat thinking about more than just making the playoffs. They want one of the top four seeds in the conference.
The opportunity is there and within reach. That's all the Heat can ask for.

Following an injury to lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos ahead of UFC 196, Nate Diaz has been tapped as the replacement to step in and face Conor McGregor in the new main event on March 5 in Las Vegas.
UFC officials confirmed the new fight on Tuesday.
Dos Anjos was forced out of the fight after suffering a broken foot last week in training, and as soon as news broke that he no longer was competing at UFC 196, a slew of potential opponents began jockeying to land the marquee spot against McGregor.
Article continues below ...
Ultimately, Diaz ended up as the choice, and now he'll get the chance to face McGregor at UFC 196 next weekend. The fight will take place at welterweight with Diaz accepting it on short notice and McGregor happily accepting the move to 170 pounds.
The outspoken Stockton, Calif. native just recently defeated Michael Johnson at FOX UFC Fight Night in December, but just before that fight he was calling out McGregor for a potential matchup.
The latest on UFC Featherweight Champion Conor McGregor
"He talks all that money fight s–t, he knows where it's at. It's right here," Diaz said in December. "It's not these guys fighting in the main event. The main event's right here. These guys already got punked out at that press conference. He already beat them. That's a win.
"If he wants to fight a real fight, he knows where's it at, he knows where the money fight's at. It's right here."
McGregor responded in kind after he won a "Fighter of the Year" award earlier this month, taking aim at Diaz and painting him as a minor leaguer in the UFC.
"I heard Nate Diaz couldn't even afford the flight over to Las Vegas for the ceremony," McGregor said in his acceptance speech.
"Stop holding bitterness deep in your bum soul. Stuck on $20,000 to show and $20,000 to fight. I wipe my ass with that money. I tip your wage, Nate, yeah."
Now the rivals will get to settle their differences inside the Octagon as the new headliner for UFC 196 in Las Vegas, with the women's bantamweight title fight between Holly Holm and Miesha Tate as the co-main event.
McGregor (19-2) won the featherweight title in December, winning his long-awaited matchup with Jose Aldo in 13 seconds. The Irish pay-per-view star had hoped to hold the 155-pound lightweight belt simultaneously by beating Dos Anjos (24-7).
Diaz and his older brother, Nick, are rivaled only by McGregor himself as mixed martial arts' most eloquent trash-talkers, and the UFC 196 fighters are already off to an entertaining start.
While fans speculated about McGregor's new opponent earlier Tuesday, Nate Diaz tweeted: "He's going to have to get on his knees and beg…"
He's going to have to get on his knees and beg… — Nathan Diaz (@NateDiaz209) February 23, 2016
Diaz was echoing previously comments from McGregor, who has said he wants his future opponents to line up "on their knees with their hands out. I want them to beg" for the payday that comes with fighting him.
White detailed the promotion's hustle to fill the matchup with McGregor in an interview on ESPN's "SportsCenter," saying Aldo and Frankie Edgar turned down the short-notice fight. Edgar is thought to be injured, while the short preparation time wasn't enough for Aldo.
White said Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone and former champions Anthony Pettis and BJ Penn and other fighters were willing to take the bout, but the UFC chose Diaz.
The 170-pound weight limit against Diaz also sets up McGregor for a dry run at fighting as a welterweight, 25 pounds above the featherweight division. McGregor's trainer has claimed the fighter has trouble making the 145-pound limit, although McGregor has dismissed the concern.
McGregor has boasted of his intention to win belts in multiple weight classes, and the UFC could be entertaining the possibility of matching McGregor against welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at its landmark UFC 200 show on July 9 in Las Vegas' new T-Mobile Arena.

Daijōbu. Ki-ni shinai-de. (That's OK. Don't worry.)
Situation 1: Mr. Sere and his girlfriend Yuri are talking after a small argument.
ユリ： ねえ、私、ちょっと言い過ぎちゃったみたい。ごめんなさい。
セレ： ああ、さっきのこと、気にしているの？ だいじょうぶ。気にしないで。
Yuri: Nē, watashi, chotto ii-sugichatta mitai. Gomennasai.
Sere: ā, sakki-no koto, ki-ni shite-iru-no? Daijōbu. Ki-ni shinaide.
Yuri: Well, I might have gone too far. I'm sorry.
Sere: Oh, are you worrying about what you said earlier? That's OK. Don't worry.
The word 気（き）has many meanings, such as “mind,” “mood” and “feeling,” and there are a lot of expressions that use 気. Today, we will introduce the proper uses of 気にする and 気になる, which are heard in daily conversation. X (person) はY (something) を気にする means X worries about Y or X is anxious about Y, and expresses someone is anxious about something or becomes sensitive about something. For example: 小（ちい）さな間違（まちが）いは気（き）にしないでどんどん話（はな）したほうが外国語（がいこくご）は上手（じょうず）になる (You'll make progress in foreign languages if you speak without hesitation and ignore small mistakes). XはYを気にしている is used to express a state of being, for example: 彼女（かのじょ）は人（ひと）の評価（ひょうか）を気（き）にするタイプだ (She's the type that always worries about other people's opinions). 気にしないで（ください）is often used to cheer someone up, as in 小（ちい）さな失敗（しっぱい）なんか気（き）にしないで (Don't mind small failures), or to convey the speaker's concern toward someone's thanks or apology. Example: 「いつもお手数（てすう）をおかけしてすみません。」「そんなこと、気（き）にしないでください」”I'm sorry to be so troublesome.” “Never mind/Don't mention it”).
Situation 2: Ms. Tamachi and her colleague Ms. Gray are talking about what Mr. Mita said, or rather didn't say.
田町： 三田さん、さっき何か言いかけたでしょう？気になるなあ。
グレイ： うん。途中でやめると、よけいに気になるね。
Tamachi: Mita-san, sakki nanika iikaketa-deshō? Ki-ni naru-nā.
Gray: Un. Tochū-de yameru-to, yokei-ni ki-ni naru-ne.
Tamachi: A little while ago, Mr. Mita was going to say something, but he stopped. It makes me nervous.
Gray: Yeah. Since he suddenly stopped, it's a worry.
X (person) はY (something) が気になる means that Y gets on X's nerve, that X cares or minds about Y, and expresses that X becomes anxious or uneasy because of Y. 気になる and 気にする are similar in meaning: 気にする is used when someone pays attention to Y intentionally, while X (person) はY (something/someone) が気になる sounds like X worries about Y spontaneously. It is also used to express that X is interested in or attracted to Y. 仕事で、ちょっと気になるタイプの人が私の課に入った (Someone who is just my type has joined my section at work).
Bonus Dialogue: In the restroom, Mr. Mita is looking in the mirror carefully. His colleague Mr. Sere happens to come in. Mr. Mita talks to him.
三田： きのう、髪（かみ）を切（き）りに行（い）ったら、ちょっと短（みじか）くなりすぎちゃったんだ。すごく気（き）になるよ。
セレ： 気分（きぶん）が変（か）わっていいんじゃない？ 気にすることはないよ。
三田： でも、ちょっと太（ふと）って見（み）えるんだ。
セレ： そうかなあ。気にしすぎだよ。…あ、わかった！ きょうはNF社（しゃ）の今井（いまい）さんに会（あ）いに行（い）く日（ひ）だね。それで、気にしているのか。
三田： えっ、まあね…。今井さんはちょっと気になるタイプだからさ…。

Mita: I had a haircut yesterday, and it's too short. It really bothers me.
Sere: Don't worry. It's good to change your look.
Mita: But it makes me look a little fat.
Sere: I wonder. You worry too much. Oh, I got it! Today you're going to NF company to meet Ms. Imai. That's why you're so stressed.
Mita: Eh? Well, yeah. She's kind of my type.
Sere: I see. Then you should pay attention to the estimates in the document more than your appearance. She checks them carefully.
Mita: Oh, you're right. I haven't looked them over yet. (He leaves.)
Sere: I wonder if the documents are OK. That's what I'm more worried about.
KGI is refuting claims made in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week that Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 would replace Lightning with a USB-C port.
KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo today writes that this is not the case, all three new 2017 iPhones (two modest updates to existing iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and one radically-redesigned OLED bezel-less device) will retain the proprietary Lightning port. Apple will add fast charging capabilities with internal component changes …

Apparently, Apple will change the underlying power management technologies with the new iPhone to add ‘fast charging' features. This brings some of the power benefits of a USB-C port, ‘Type C Power Delivery', without changing the physical connector.
To enable faster charging, Apple will source new components from Texas Instruments and Cypress. The iPhone 8's 2-cell L shaped battery design, previously reported here, will also enable the device to charge more quickly. It is not clear if these advancements also tie in to rumors about wireless charging coming to the iPhone 8.
Kuo said that whilst the USB-C port would enable faster data rates than the maximum speed of USB 3 Lightning, this is not sufficient reason to motivate Apple to change connectors, calling it a ‘niche application' of the iPhone. KGI's report does not comment on how USB-C synergizes with the iPad lineup where faster data transfer has more benefits for computer tasks. (New iPads are expected soon.)
KGI says Apple has two primary reasons to keep Lightning around; sustain MFi royalties from the iOS accessories ecosystem, and form factor considerations. A USB-C port is larger than a Lightning port — and Apple is squeezing as much as it can into the new phone's body.
Apple introduced the Lightning port in 2012, with the iPhone 5. Its predecessor, the 30-pin dock connector, was present on Apple devices for more than a decade. Therefore, the Wall Street Journal's claims that the port would go away in favor of Lightning was somewhat surprising.
It may be true that Apple includes a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box with the new iPhone models, rather than the typical rectangular USB-A cable. Nevertheless, KGI firmly believes that the Lightning port is here to stay for sometime yet. On the flip side, adopting USB-C would bring the iOS devices inline with Apple's latest MacBooks that only offers USB-C ports.
Apple is expected to launch three new iPhones in the fall. One is purported to be a major radical redesign, featuring a 5.8 inch OLED display, larger battery, and bezel-less design, plus two iterative updates that retain the same chassis as the current iPhone 7 series. The high-end OLED iPhone has been rumored to cost in excess of $1000 — and come in 64 GB and 256 GB configurations.
The major new phone is being colloquially referred to as the iPhone 8 whereas the modest upgrades are being labelled as ‘iPhone 7s' devices, although the final marketing names are unknown.
Forget lime wedges, lemon twists and little pink umbrellas -- the latest cocktail garnish craze has six (or eight) legs and a crunchy finish.
At high-end bars in the United States and United Kingdom, bartenders are crafting cocktails with ingredients like crickets, tarantulas, scorpions and even giant ants.
The Artesian bar at the Langham hotel in London has been serving up their Langham Tea Punch for just over a year. The ingredients include Courvoisier cognac, Japanese sencha tea and an oven-baked tarantula and scorpion. Just last month, the bar upped the ante by introducing their Vieux Carre cocktail, which pairs cognac and rye whiskey with a side of toasted Colombian giant ants and Mopani worms. Both cocktails cost £16.50
“The drinks are a great talking point since insects aren't a typical source of nutrition in the UK,” said Artesian head barman Alex Kratena, who noted the cocktails are usually ordered in groups. “Some insects get toasted, which brings the drink extra flavour and some are used for decorative purposes. Most are rather tasty!”
Stateside, White and Church in New York City serves up a trio of insect cocktails, including a cinnamon-flavoured rum paired with honeybees, a margarita-like drink with Mexican spicy worms, and a Batida de Cocco drink with heavy cream and dried grasshoppers. The drinks ring up at $13 each.

Community Q&A
One thing we're particularly fond of is the two-way dialogue that we have with our Community. We got hit with some particularly interesting questions this week, so we figured we'd share the answers for all to see.
“Does BlockCAT have any takeaways from the recent kitty storm on Ethereum network?” — Mohammad, Telegram
“Does BlockCAT have any plans to integrate with other platforms?” — Joomorrow, Discord
The release of Cryptokitties has taken the Ethereum world by storm. This is unprecedented for the network, as we've never seen sustained transaction volume of this scale before. Many of our community members have been asking us for our thoughts on this, and whether or not we feel like a different blockchain would be worth utilizing.
We feel that the Ethereum foundation has shown a stellar track record in its operation and leadership of the Ethereum platform. Several scaling strategies and second layer infrastructure are already in the works, such as EIP 648, a parallelization strategy, and Plasma, which will take the network to its next level of global support.
At this time, Ethereum still remains the primary market for smart contracts and decentralized applications, and we have no intention of moving away from it. We constantly survey the Blockchain ecosystem and will always adapt to what the best platform for our needs is.
TL;DR
Cryptokitties shows what needs to change about Ethereum, but they're doing it. No plans to switch, but we'd consider it if there was reason to.
Indian scientists have developed a process by which plastic waste can be converted into petrol and diesel. The country generates 15000 tons of plastic waste every day.
New Delhi (Sputnik) — The Indian government said scientists of state-owned CSIR-Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun, in collaboration with oil company GAIL (India), have developed a process by which waste plastics of polyethylene and polypropylene types can be utilized.
“CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT), Hyderabad has developed a catalyst that can be used for conversion of waste plastics to fuel oils. One kilogram of waste polyethylene and polypropylene can be converted to either about 600-650 ml of petrol or 700-750 ml of diesel along with LPG,” YS Chowdary, India's Minister of State for Science and Technology, said.
According to official figures, 27.18 grams of plastic waste is generated by an Indian per day but the country has failed to recycle more than half of t. “There are certain plants operating in foreign countries which claim to convert waste plastic into plastic oil/fuel oil/diesel. CSIR laboratories are involved in R&D of converting waste plastics into fuel oil by appropriate processes,” Chowdary added.

Germany, the US and Japan possess such green technology. Indian scientists claimed that costs of the petrol (gasoline) using green technology is half the cost of petrol generated from crude oil. However, the government did not divulge the details from when it will produce petrol and diesel at a mass level.
The present share of power generated from urban, industrial and agricultural wastes including urban soil share of these waste to energy is around 0.08% of the total installed power generation capacity in the country.
The Indian government has prepared an elaborate roadmap to achieve the goal of 10% reduction in import dependency of crude oil.

The Vatican's finance chief George Pell is seeking legal advice after being accused of an "almost sociopathic" approach to child abuse allegations.
The allegations from Peter Saunders, a member of the Vatican's own commission on child protection, come as Australia investigates historic abuses.
Australian-born Cardinal Pell denies accusations he helped cover up abuses by a paedophile priest.
He has offered to testify at the Australian inquiry.
Mr Saunders, himself a victim of abuse by a priest, was appointed by Pope Francis last year to the Vatican's new commission to protect children.

He said Cardinal Pell had a "catalogue of denial" about child abuse in the church, which was "making a mockery" of the Vatican's wider abuse investigations.
"He has a catalogue of denigrating people, of acting with callousness, cold-heartedness, almost sociopathic I would go as far as to say, this lack of care," he said about the Cardinal's handling of abuse claims.
"Given the position of George Pell as a cardinal of the church and a position of huge authority within the Vatican, I think he is a massive, massive thorn in the side of Pope Francis's papacy if he's allowed to remain."
A spokesperson for Mr Pell on Monday described the claims as "false and misleading" and said the Cardinal would now consult with his legal advisers.
"Cardinal Pell has never met Mr Saunders, who seems to have formed his strong opinions without ever having spoken to His Eminence," said the spokesperson in a statement.
"In light of all of the available material, including evidence from the Cardinal under oath, there is no excuse for broadcasting incorrect and prejudicial material," the statement said.
Abuse investigation
Australia is investigating how schools, churches and the government responded to child abuse cases.
A royal commission has been hearing testimony from victims in Ballarat in the state of Victoria, where priest Gerald Ridsdale had sexually abused dozens of boys in various parishes between the 1950s and 1970s.

Cardinal Pell has been accused of being complicit in moving Ridsdale around the state, and of attempting to bribe Ridsdale's nephew into keeping quiet about his abuse.
Ridsdale, 81, was defrocked and is in jail for more than 140 sexual offences against child victims. He has been testifying at the inquiry.
Last Thursday the commission released a letter from Cardinal Pell saying he was "horrified" by the accounts given in Ballarat.
The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was formed in April 2013, following pressure from lawmakers amid police claims that the Roman Catholic Church had concealed evidence of paedophile priests.
There were revelations that child abusers were being moved from place to place instead of being reported to and investigated by police for their alleged crimes.
Nuances are evident once the data is broken down into subgroups. Unsurprisingly, the people who dislike opt-outs the most are Democrats, with 61 percent of them in opposition, versus just 22 percent in support. Parents and teachers in particular are more supportive of opt-outs, with about a third of each group endorsing them (though the objection to it is almost just as strong as that of the general public).
Meanwhile, African Americans and Hispanics (which, along with teachers, were oversampled in the survey) fall somewhere in the middle, and they appear to be the least opposed to the movement. Notably, civil-rights groups, many of them advocating on behalf of children of color, have been especially vocal in their opposition to testing exemptions on the grounds that the data is critical to improving the outcomes of disadvantaged students.
Also noteworthy is that a sizable chunk of Republican respondents actually say they oppose the movement: 57 percent, which puts them in second place (tied with teachers) if each subgroup were to be ranked on how much they object to opt outs. To be sure, as a Republican education summit earlier this week demonstrated, there's hardly any consensus on testing within the GOP. The New York Times reported that Jeb Bush, for one, emphasized his support for annual testing, invoking one of his brother's signature phrases when defending the mandate: the “soft bigotry of low expectations.”
The Education Next survey (whose results were published a day before the summit) found overwhelming support for the assessment requirement: About two-thirds of the general public supports the requirement, while only a fifth or so opposes it. That ratio is relatively consistent across the subgroups—except one: teachers.
But even teachers were just short of coming out with a majority opposition to the testing. In fact, they appear evenly split on the topic, with just under half of the group each supporting or opposing the federal requirement.
These survey results could suggest that Bush's education platform is more representative of the American people than that of his contenders. After all, most of the Republicans candidates have vowed to get rid of the Common Core despite data from the survey suggesting that just over a third of the general public opposes it. Moreover, as the Education Next researchers write, although support for the standards has continued to decline, the rate of decline “slowed markedly … perhaps suggesting that opinion on the issue has begun to stabilize.”
But again, there are nuances. The survey found that, though only a minority of the general public opposes the Common Core, it continues to lose outright support. This year's poll found that just about half—49 percent—of Americans overall support the standards, down from 53 percent last year. And even though Education Next varied the questions' wording for some respondents—replacing the phrase “Common Core” with the more generic “standards in reading and math that are the same across the states”—opinion was relatively consistent.
Joan Collins is right. Any woman who wants to stay beautiful (like me!) needs to diet every day of her life
'Joan, 79, said she controlled her weight during a long career so that she could stay in work - an entirely laudable attitude'
When my husband and I invited friends to dinner, I knew they'd want to bring something along as a contribution to the evening and made a point of saying that wasn't necessary.
So when one friend arrived and thrust a hefty box of chocolates into my hands, I rewarded her with ice-cold contempt rather than the grateful smile she was clearly expecting.
At the end of the evening, that very expensive box of hand-made French chocolates was consigned to the bottom of the kitchen bin, the contents ruined by the coffee dregs I had deliberately poured over them.
I am 42 years old and have been on a permanent diet for the past 30 years. The logic is simple and irrefutable: any self-respecting woman wants to be thin, and to be thin you need to spend your life on a diet.
I don't believe overweight is ever attractive. Whether we like it or not, we live in an age and a part of the world where men and women regard thin as beautiful.
As an actress, this is something Joan Collins understands only too well, revealing last week that the secret to maintaining a perfect hourglass figure into your 70s is spending every day on a diet.
Joan, 79, said she controlled her weight during a long career so that she could stay in work - an entirely laudable attitude.
Like Joan, I have no intention of letting my body slide flabbily into middle age. I believe that any woman with a modicum of self-respect should watch her figure with the same vigour. Is it any coincidence that Joan is still attractive and in demand for work?
I was glad to see the back of Easter this month, as it seems to have been hijacked by the greedy masses who regard it as a free pass to gorge on chocolate.
Not a morsel passed my lips. Chocolate, cakes, sweets and any other calorie-rich, fat-laden 'foods' are banned in my home.
For three decades, self-denial has been my best friend. And one of my biggest incentives is that I know men prefer slim women.
I have only ever dated men who kept a strict eye on my figure. My partners are not only boyfriends but weight-loss coaches.
My first love continually reminded me that one can never be too rich or too thin, and my husband of five years frequently tells me that if I put on weight he will divorce me.
In the workplace, male bosses will always give the top job to a woman who looks fit and in control, rather than one who looks like a bulging sack in danger of imminent cardiac arrest.
I have some insight here, as I was overweight until I was 14 years old. Bitter experience taught me that the world pays no attention to dumpy girls.
Little wonder that in my mid-teens I decided to lose my puppy fat, transforming myself as I lived, for the best part of a year, on Marmite on toast (no butter).
The first summer I felt thin coincided with a family holiday abroad. While this provided an opportunity to show off my svelte new figure, I had to watch my calorie intake even more carefully.
'I have only ever dated men who kept a strict eye on my figure. My partners are my weight-loss coaches'
I fainted with hunger on one occasion - a minor hitch, eclipsed by the fact that I was being asked out on lots of dates.
At college I invented the Polo diet. Eating a pack of mints for breakfast and another for lunch, I could make each one last hours.
Slim pickings
The average woman spends 31 years of her life on a diet
I am 5ft 11in and slimmed down to a size 8. One of my lecturers was so worried she pulled me aside to voice her concern. I put her intervention down to jealousy, as she was a size 16.
The Polo diet paid off: I could wear whatever I wanted and looked fantastic. I stopped only after a stern lecture from my dentist about the damage I was doing to my teeth.
My 20s were dominated by dieting, and I managed to stay a steady size 8/10. If I put on a pound or two, I simply skipped a meal. I actually enjoyed - and still do - the hunger pangs. I see them as a reminder that I am not pigging out on pizzas and fast food.
I even chose holidays according to the indigenous diet. India was a favourite because I lost weight on meagre vegetarian servings.
To avoid culinary temptation, I even made a point of renting a house without a kitchen. Of course, constantly denying myself food was not and is not easy, but it has always brought enough rewards to make it worthwhile
Florida was a disaster, so obscenely huge were the portions. Never again.
In those days I didn't use scales to tell me if I'd gained weight: I went by the fit of my clothes. My benchmark was a pair of unforgiving, size 8, Agnes B skinny-fit trousers.
A friend and I had a coded way of referring to the success of my latest diet. 'Ah! The Agnes B trousers are on!' she'd say, as I strutted across to the table at whichever restaurant we were meeting in.
In my early 30s I lived in Los Angeles. The entire city is permanently on a diet, heaven for a serial dieter like me. I was a size 8, and became accustomed to surviving on fewer than 1,000 calories a day.
I'd have a large black coffee for breakfast, so strong the caffeine would make me tremble. For lunch I'd eat a bagel with the bread inside scooped out and replaced with salad. Evening meals were either sushi or egg-white omelettes.
'There is nothing that signifies failure better than fat'
To avoid culinary temptation, I even made a point of renting a house without a kitchen. Of course, constantly denying myself food was not and is not easy, but it has always brought enough rewards to make it worthwhile.
In Los Angeles, for example, where I worked as a television producer, I was never out of work and never without a boyfriend.
My self-control has slipped, on occasion, and I have found myself putting on weight. When I married my French husband, Pascal, in 2008, I wasn't at my thinnest. I suffered a bout of depression after losing my television company the previous year, and had gone up to a size 14.
Luckily for me, there is no better weight-loss incentive than a Frenchman. Pascal would not tolerate a fat wife and has told me that if I put on weight, our marriage is over. What more motivation do I need?
Today I am a size 12 and I never eat between meals. Elevenses aren't an excuse to gorge on carbs - it's just another hour on the clock.
Typically, I eat porridge for breakfast, a salad for lunch, and meat or fish with vegetables for dinner. Occasionally I allow myself some cheese, and I often have a yoghurt after dinner.
I maintain a food diary. I never shop when I'm hungry, I always read the packaging, and I weigh myself every other day.
Like my female French in-laws, I follow an extreme low-calorie diet four times a year - one each season. I lose at least half-a-stone each time, though the side-effects mean that I don't have the mental or physical fortitude to work.

June 26, 2013; Forbes
Howard Husock, a contributor to Forbes.com and the director of the Social Entrepreneurship Initiative at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, recently posted data about the charitable giving habits of the 400 wealthiest individuals in the United States. He argues these individuals are extraordinarily generous when you look not at the percentage of their wealth, but at the total dollars given. For example, combined, the wealthiest 400 individuals pledged $328.7 million, significantly more than what he identifies as the total $300 million in charitable contributions made by Americans in a typical year. He further demonstrates that the self-made billionaires are more generous (donating approximately 6 percent of their riches) than their peers who came by wealth through inheritance, who typically donate 3.7 percent of their net worth.
As further proof of their generosity, many of the Forbes 400 have signed Bill Gates and Warren Buffet's Giving Pledge to donate at least half of their wealth before they die or shortly after. The list boasts the likes of Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Jeff Skoll (eBay), David Rockefeller, and Joan and Irwin Jacobs (Qualcomm).
Husock, sharing research completed by his colleague Claire Rogers, identified the 786 causes that received funds donated by the wealthy of the Forbes 400. This information was broken down into the various subsectors. Out of 786 causes identified, approximately 27 percent were higher education and another 27 percent arts, cultural, and other institutions (including museums, historical preservation, and non-health scientific research). Only 6 percent provided basic needs, 5 percent worked with youth/family services, and 5 percent were engaged in environmental and/or animal concerns. Even fewer gifts went to international or religious organizations. (To be clear, these represent numbers of causes, not percentages of funds given. It would be good to know the percentage of dollars given to each subsector, but the data doesn't say.)
Ken Stern argues that Americans at the bottom of the income pyramid give a higher percentage of their income (3.7 percent) than the wealthy overall (1.3 percent). However, only the wealthy itemize. Without the benefit of itemization, those of low income are actually donating 100 percent of every dollar they hand over—unlike the wealthy, who receive a percentage back at tax season. Stern argues this distinction increases the relative generosity of the low-income.
Why are the poor so generous? It is possible, and many have argued, that living through challenges encourages empathy. Empathy lends itself easily to philanthropy. Some suggest this affects how we give. The wealthy often give to higher education (their alma mater, perhaps?), and nonprofits in the arts, cultural, and humanities subsector. The poor on the other hand are more likely to give to religious organizations or to human service nonprofits, also known as poverty-fighting charities.
Regardless, it is important to recognize that the number of charitable dollars donated in the United States doesn't fluctuate significantly. Indiana University's Giving USA study indicates that philanthropy hovers between 2 and 2.2 percent of the country's GDP. As generous as we would like to believe we are, there seems to be a limit. The question is, with that money, that 2 percent of GDP, how “charitable” do we want to be?—Jennifer Amanda Jones
Canadians may have just survived the steepest drop in quarterly economic growth in the post-war period, with mounting evidence pointing to a decline in gross domestic product that could be as high as 9%, an economist said Wednesday.
There is less than two weeks to go before the first quarter ends, and the early economic indicators have caused many economists to downgrade their economic outlooks for the period.
Wednesday, David Wolf, the Canadian economist at Merrill Lynch, outlined the most bearish forecast yet. Mr. Wolf said deteriorating conditions have led him to believe that Canada's economy will have shrunk by a steep 9.1% in the first three months of the year. This compares with his previous forecast for a 6.5% drop.
The forecast is more than double the contraction predicted by RBC Capital Markets, which has penciled in a 4.4% decline in GDP in the quarter, and well above other predictions by TD Securities, CIBC World Markets and BMO Capital Markets, which fall closer to a 6% contraction.
These levels have been gradually lowered in the past couple of months as economists adjust their outlooks in line with recent worse-than-expected declines in employment, manufacturing sales, housing starts and exports.
Given the current forecasts, it is beginning to look increasingly likely that the economic contraction in the first quarter of this year will surpass the drop of 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 1990, which was the biggest percentage decline in GDP since modern records began in 1961.
Mr. Wolf said the downward revision reflected the faster-than-expected deterioration of the economy. He said there were four specific developments that caused him to take the outlook so low. There were: the revision in Merrill Lynch's 2009 forecasts for a 0.5% global contraction from 0.4% growth, and a 3.1% drop in the U.S. compared with its previous prediction of 2.6%; the expectation that the U.S. dollar would buy $1.35 Canadian dollars by the end of the year compared with its prior forecast of $1.27; the extension of Canadian inventory and housing stock overhangs through the fourth quarter of 2008; and more-intense-than-expected weakness in core areas of private domestic demand.
“Our base case does not foresee Canada's economy regaining its third quarter 2008 peak until well into 2011 — an extended period of sub-par economic performance despite the ostensible ‘recovery' in 2010,” Mr. Wolf said.
BMO indicated Wednesday that there were also downward risks to its outlook for a 6.2% contraction in the first quarter after wholesale trade plunged 4.2% in January, its second largest decline ever.
“Canada's outsized dependence on commodities is the economy's other major Achilles heel in this environment,” said Douglas Porter, the deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. “In Canadian dollar terms, prices are down more than 25% from the first half of last year and back to levels prevailing in 2004. Not surprisingly, this has delivered a second heavy hit to Canadian exports, with non-auto shipments in January already down almost 20% from last year's average.”
The debate over whether the economy can recover later this year has sucked in everyone from the Prime Minister, to the International Monetary Fund to former and current Bank of Canada Governors. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has faced criticism after stating last week that Canadians will face a milder downturn and a quicker recover than most other countries.
Wednesday, Mr. Harper defended his outlook.
“It's not rosy or unrealistic. It is very realistic,” Mr. Harper said. “But it is not negative and pessimistic and without hope and without policy.”
Mr. Harper also said Canada's economy cannot recover from recession until the United States fixes the problems with its financial system.

For prime minister Tony Abbott, this was not so much a budget as a settling of old scores.
Cast your mind back to 2010, when Abbott was denied power in a hung parliament by Labor, the Greens, and two country independents who wished to advance policy on climate change and renewable energy. Ever since, Abbott and the right-wing faction that put him there – the people Paul Keating famously described as ‘right-wing nutcases' – have vowed revenge.
The proposed trashing of the $3.1 billion Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which under various guises has for years backed Australia's world-leading solar research and demonstration projects for the energy technologies of the future, was the coup de grace.
Ham-fisted attack
The budget has provided Abbott and treasurer Joe Hockey the opportunity to implement many of the 75-point wish list drawn up by the ultra-conservative Institute of Public Affairs, an influence the government attempted to disguise by asking the Commission of Audit to prepare its 86 recommendations in its ham-fisted documents. Hence the attack on education, health funding and welfare payments that will affect the least advantaged, and the tax cuts for corporates.
But it is ‘green policy' and anything that resembles it that riles this government the most. Consider Hockey's comments about wind farms being ‘utterly offensive'. With proposals to repeal the carbon price, dismantle the Climate Change Authority and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and the dilution of the Renewable Energy Target already in train, these budget measures – which include the closure of ARENA, the dumping of the Million Solar Roofs program (both contrary to election promises) and the research funding cuts at the CSIRO, Bureau of Meteorology and elsewhere – mean that the obliteration of the Clean Energy Future package will be complete, if it can get past the Senate.
Environmental vandalism
The closure of ARENA, which still had $3.1 billion of funds to be invested over the next 10 years, appears the most vindictive, and like the move to pull the CEFC, a case of economic and environmental vandalism. The budget document talks endlessly about the need for ‘innovation', for new investment and infrastructure. ARENA, like the CEFC, was able to leverage billions of dollars in private finance – a rate of $2.50 of private funds for every $1 invested.
Chief executive Ivor Frischknecht says that until the Senate decides otherwise, the agency will continue to work through its applications. It has more than 190 proposals worth $7.7 billion (two-thirds private money) on the table. He says that reflects not just the level of disappointment, but the ‘scale of investment that is unlikely to go ahead because of the proposed closure'.
ARENA has been branded as one of many examples of ‘corporate welfare', but in reality more than 150 of its 180 projects already allocated are in support of research and development, a core competency of any advanced economy. Future funding of that research will be lost. Corporate welfare will continue to be doled out to manufacturers in other sectors.
ARENA was not the only victim of the budget axe. The Million Solar Roofs program, once a $1 billion centrepiece of Direct Action to bring solar to lower-income earners and renters, has sunk without trace — replaced by a derisory $2.1 million program to install solar on RSLs and bowling clubs in seven electorates, many of them marginal (yes, really).
Rubbish collectors
It has cut another $459.3 million (or around three-quarters) of remaining funds from the Carbon Capture and Storage Flagships Program, cut $16.8 million over two years from the National Low Emissions Coal Initiative, slashed $111.4 million over four years from the CSIRO, $10 million from the Bureau of Meteorology, and $21.7 million from its Environmental Science programs.
Left in place are $525 million to pay up to 15,000 under-25s to pick up litter at below-award wages under the guise of the Green Army, and a diesel fuel tax exemption for miners and other off-grid users worth $2 billion a year, which may ironically relieve some of the pain of having financing for cleaner, cheaper options such as off-grid solar removed.
The centrepiece of the government's Direct Action policy, which replaces the carbon price, also seems to be in a state of utter confusion. The budget papers mention $2.55 billion set aside ‘over 10 years' rather than the four set aside by the government previously. The office of environment minister Greg Hunt described this as a ‘printing mistake', but Treasury documents also allocate just $1.1 billion of actual expenditure over the coming four years, suggesting that Treasury boffins have little faith in the emissions reduction fund attracting any meaningful offers for abatement. Bankers still describe the policy as ‘wishful thinking'.
Industry appalled
The renewables industry is appalled. ARENA means the cancellation of future valuable research projects, that aspirational projects such as the solar towers with storage will not get built in Port Augusta (but will in many other countries), and programs to help miners get used to new technologies such as solar PV will be wound back – and billions of dollars of potential investment deferred. While the global market for renewable-energy jobs is surging to more than 6.5 million, jobs in renewable energy in Australia will go, and those in the industry will likely have to move overseas.
ARENA chairman Greg Bourne says that while the outcome of the RET review – led by climate change sceptic Dick Warburton – is not yet known, it looks as though the government is looking to ‘clear the decks' of clean energy.
‘From cleared decks, the question is then, what do you build?' Bourne told RenewEconomy. ‘The government is leaving behind a set of options that would allow it to accelerate the deployment of clean energy, and they may well need those options in the future. We are trying to build the infrastructure of the 21st century in terms of energy.'
Instead, according to Abbott and Hockey, we are to build the roads of the 21st century. Welcome to the asphalt economy.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is field-testing a new bumper sticker slogan that says, "Democrats 2018: I mean, have you seen the other guys?"
The proposed slogan appeared in an email from the DCCC asking subscribers to vote on which new bumper sticker they would like to own.
The largely negative campaign angle earned a less-than-enthusiastic reception in some quarters of Twitter.
Not exactly the most inspiring political slogan, @dccc: pic.twitter.com/oIE9bTBHa0 — Derek Willis (@derekwillis) July 5, 2017
Other proposed slogans included "she persisted, we resisted" and "make Congress blue again."

The National Republican Congressional Committee responded with its own bumper sticker idea for the DCCC, proposing, "Democrats 2018: We win moral victories, not elections."
According to an April poll, more Americans consider the Democratic Party "out of touch" than are either the Republican Party or President Donald Trump.

Going largely unnoticed in Greece and beyond, an important anniversary passes annually on March 23.
The date in 1943 marks one of the most important moments in the history of World War II and the Holocaust — when the Archbishop of Greece, Damaskinos, openly defied Adolf Hitler's Final Solution with a letter of protest (see text below) — unique in the annals of occupied Europe.
According to the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation, “It required virtue and courage to sign such a document in those dark times.”
In contrast to many Catholic and Protestant religious leaders in Europe, who either supported the Nazi policy of extermination of the Jews or did nothing to stop it, Archbishop Damaskinos of Greece formally protested the deportation of Jews.
After learning of the deportation of the Thessaloniki Jews in March 1943, Damaskinos spearheaded a letter of protest to the Germans. This letter was composed by the famous Greek poet Angelos Sikilianos and was signed by many members of the Athens intelligentsia.
In the letter, Damaskinos included the biblical quote “There is neither Jew nor Greek,” emphasizing that all people are the same in the Greek Orthodox religion.
He described the long history of the Jews in Greece and how, as exemplary citizens, they presented no threat to Germany. He warned that one day the world would hold those who deported Jews accountable.
There is no similar document of protest against Nazi occupiers during WWII that has come to light in any other European country.
In 1949, Sikelianos was a Nobel Prize for Literature candidate. In 1944, Damaskinos was featured prominently on the cover of Time Magazine.

When General Jürgen Stroop, high SS and police leader for Greece, found out who was behind the letter, he threatened to shoot Damaskinos. The archbishop bravely reminded the German that, “According to the traditions of the Greek Orthodox Church, our prelates are hung and not shot. Please respect our traditions.”
The Germans proceeded with the deportations.
Damaskinos called the police chief of Athens, Angelos Evert, to his office and said:
“I have spoken to God and my conscience tells me what we must do. The church will issue false baptismal certificates to any Jew who asks for them and you will issue false identification cards.”
Due to Damaskinos's courageous stance, thousands of Greek Jews were spared.
In addition to his letter, the archbishop was pivotal in saving the lives of thousands of Jews in Athens. Together with the Athenian chief of police, Damaskinos ordered priests to give Jews Christian “baptismal certificates,” offering them Christian names and refuge from Nazi checkpoints and round ups.
For his efforts, Damaskinos was honored by Yad Vashem in Jerusalem as “Righteous among the nations,” an important designation given to non-Jews who risked their own lives to save Jews during the Holocaust. He is also recognized prominently in a permanent exhibition at the International Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C.
A statue of Damaskinos occupies a prominent position in the main courtyard of the Athens Metropolitan Cathedral.
The complete text of Damaskinos' letter directed to the Nazi-imposed Greek prime minister follows…

The Prime Minister

ATHENS
Mr. Prime Minister
The Greek people were rightfully surprised and deeply grieved to learn that the German Occupation Authorities have already started to put into effect a program of gradual deportation of the Greek Jewish community of Salonika to places beyond our national borders, and that the first groups of deportees are already on their way to Poland. The grief of the Greek people is particularly deep because of the following:
According to the terms of the armistice, all Greek citizens, without distinction of race or religion, were to be treated equally by the Occupation Authorities.
The Greek Jews have proven themselves not only valuable contributors to the economic growth of the country but also law-abiding citizens who fully understand their duties as Greeks. They made sacrifices for the Greek country and were always on the front line in the struggles of the Greek nation to defend its inalienable historical rights.
The law-abiding nature of the Jewish community in Greece refutes a priori any charge that it may be involved in actions or acts that might even slightly endanger the safety of the Military Occupation Authorities.
In our national consciousness, all the children of Mother Greece are an inseparable unity: they are equal members of the national body irrespective of religion or dogmatic differences.
Our Holy Religion does not recognize superior or inferior qualities based on race or religion, as it is stated: ”There is neither Jew nor Greek” (Gal. 3:28) and thus condemns any attempt to discriminate or create racial or religious differences.
Our common fate, both in days of glory and in periods of national misfortune, forged inseparable bonds between all Greek citizens, without exemption, irrespective of race.
Certainly, we are not unaware of the deep conflict between the new Germany and the Jewish community, nor do we intend to become defenders or judges of world Jewry in the great sphere of world politics and economic affairs. Today we are interested in and deeply concerned with the fate of 60,000 of our fellow citizens, who are Jews. For a long time, we have lived together in both slavery and freedom, and we have come to appreciate their feelings, their brotherly attitude, their economic activity and, most important, their indefectible patriotism. Evidence of this patriotism is the great number of victims sacrificed by the Greek Jewish community without regret and without hesitation on the altar of duty when our country was in peril.
Mr. Prime Minister,
We are certain that the thoughts and feelings of the Government on this matter are in agreement with those of the rest of the Greek nation. We also trust that you have already taken the necessary steps and applied to the Occupation Authorities to rescind the grievous and futile measure to deport the members of the Jewish community of Greece.
We hope, indeed, that you have clarified to those in power that such harsh treatment of Jews of other nationalities in Greece makes the instituted measure even more unjustifiable and therefore morally unacceptable. If security reasons underlie it, we think it possible to suggest alternatives. Other measures can be taken, such as detaining the active male population (not including children and old people) in a specific place on Greek territory under the surveillance of the Occupation Authorities, thereby guaranteeing safety in face of any alleged danger and saving the Greek Jewish community from the impending deportation. Moreover, we would like to point out that, if asked, the rest of the Greek people will be willing to vouch for their brothers in need without hesitation.
We hope that the Occupation Authorities will realize in due time the futility of the persecution of Greek Jews, who are among the most peaceful and productive elements of the country.
If, however, they insist on this policy of deportation, we believe that the Government, as the bearer of whatever political authority is left in the country, should take a clear stance against these events and let the foreigners bear the full responsibility of committing this obvious injustice. Let no one forget that all actions done during these difficult times, even those actions that lie beyond our will and power, will be assessed some day by the nation and will be subjected to historical investigation. In that time of judgment, the responsibility of the leaders will weigh heavily upon the conscience of the nation if today the leaders fail to protest boldly in the name of the nation against such unjust measures as the deportation of the Greek Jews, which are an insult to our national unity and honor.
Respectfully,
Damaskinos
Archbishop of Athens and Greece

The tool is useful for presentations, when working, and so on, to prevent unwanted notifications from getting in your way or distracting you.
The NoNotifications indicator offers only two options (and Quit): "Don't disturb", which disables the notifications and changes the indicator icon to red, and "Show notifications", which you've guessed it, enables the notifications, and changes the indicator icon to green.
Ubuntu (with Unity 7) lacks a "Do Not Disturb" mode and while NoNotifications can be useful for temporarily disabling NotifyOSD notifications, it doesn't provide a complete "Do Not Disturb" mode.
A "Do not disturb" mode that also mutes the sound, disables all kinds of popups and allows scheduling when you want to activate this mode would be extremely useful.

Editor's note: This story was updated on May 10 to reflect that the House gave the measure final approval.
Faith-based adoption agencies in Texas would be able to reject prospective parents on religious grounds under a bill the state House preliminarily approved Tuesday over strong objections from Democratic lawmakers who said it would ultimately harm children and deny good people the right to care for them.
Under House Bill 3859, which advanced on a 94-51 vote, child welfare providers would be protected from legal retaliation if they assert their “sincerely held religious beliefs” while caring for abused and neglected children. The measure would allow them to place a child in a religion-based school; deny referrals for abortion-related contraceptives, drugs or devices; and refuse to contract with other organizations that don't share their religious beliefs. (Update, May 10: The House voted Wednesday 93-49 to finally pass the bill. It is now headed to the Senate.)
Rep. James Frank, the Wichita Falls Republican who authored the bill and an adoptive father, said repeatedly during a lengthy debate Tuesday that his legislation is not meant to be exclusionary but to give providers some certainty when it comes to legal disputes. He described opposition to the bill as "fabricated hysteria."
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"You can be successful, but it will cost you," Frank said. "The bill declares a winner and says, 'You are protected.'"
But Democratic lawmakers who lined up at a podium at the back of the House chamber to question Frank said the legislation would give religious groups license to discriminate against LGBT — or Jewish or divorced — parents who want to foster or adopt, or to avoid getting children vaccinated. A vast array of things could be classified as a “sincerely held religious belief," they said.
"We're further casting these children off," said Rep. Jessica Farrar of Houston. "We're making it more difficult for them to be adopted."
Rep. Celia Israel, D-Austin, said the bill was more about political posturing than helping children.
Another Austin Democrat, Donna Howard, asked Frank if there was a provision in the bill requiring adoption agencies to report when they invoke their "sincerely held religious beliefs"; he said there wasn't and that state lawmakers would be better notified of those decisions by their constituents than any kind of report.
The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.
"Could a child be placed with strangers rather than a relative because the relative is gay or transgender?" Howard asked.
Frank said that placements are made by Child Protective Services and so are not covered under the bill.
But without "requiring providers to provide advanced notice of what rights they will deny, this is impossible for CPS to do," the House Democratic Caucus said in a tweet responding to that claim.
Before approving the bill, the GOP-dominated House rejected several amendments proposed by Democrats, many of whom also attempted to derail the bill with technical legislative maneuvers. The House still must take a final vote on the bill before it advances to the Senate.
The heated debate over the legislation and its subsequent approval comes as legislators are facing pressure to quickly pass child welfare reforms before the session ends on May 29. Texas legislators and child welfare advocates have been working to tap various communities to help care for vulnerable and abused children. The faith-based community has been seen by some state leaders as a potential solution; Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick hosted a summit in November encouraging religious congregations to help, and Texas First Lady Cecilia Abbott in January publicly urged religious groups to support foster families with donations and other activities.

House State Affairs Committee members heard testimony Wednesday afternoon on House Bill 3859, which would allow faith-based organizations to exercise their “sincerely held religious beliefs” when participating as providers in Texas' child welfare system.
Welcome to our first article on Tabletop Timesinks! Empire at War has now been released (at least in the U.S.; we've got to wait one more week for it in the U.K.!), so we thought we'd share with you our top five most wanted cards from the set.
These lists are not necessarily what we think are going to be the best or most sought-after cards in the set (Ancient Lightsaber is most likely going to be the Force Speed of EaW), but the cards that we personally want to get our hands on and put into decks straight away.
Tim's Most Wanted #5
Tim: This card will make villain mill decks viable. Decks using characters such as Unkar Plutt often generate lots of resources, so will likely be able to mill a significant portion of someone's deck in one go. Expect to see this in Thrawn/Unkar decks going forward (which is where I will be testing it out first).
Jaydee: Terrifying concept giving Plutt something this scary to spend his huge amount of resources…at least it'll keep him away from using Prized Possession on my Poe die first turn.
Tim: I'll probably still be using Prized Possession…
Jaydee's Most Wanted #5
Jaydee: Electrostaff is definitely on my watchlist, following on Spirit Of Rebellion's set, I loved Overkill and this is the melee version with an added bonus!
Tim: I really like this card. It's quite tempting to try and use it with General Grievous, but I can definitely see it being used in Mace Windu decks. It also has a disrupt side, so works well with Imperial Inspection.
Jaydee: The Grievous idea for this card sounds fantastic, I'll be glad to see him in play once again after been absent from decks for so long.
Tim's Most Wanted #4
Tim: Along with numerous other cards in Empire at War, this one is going to help make supports more action-efficient. The stats on this upgrade are probably not worth two resources, but the support activation more than makes up for it.
Jaydee: Personally I'm not a huge fan of the vehicles decks, but this set is looking to change my mind about that. Looking forwards to seen more vehicles been used for more than Poe specials.
Jaydee's Most Wanted #4
Jaydee: Lightsaber Training is a must for me as I'm aiming at a nice blue weapons deck.
Tim: I'm not as big a fan of this card as you are, but if you're going heavily into blue weapons it is definitely good value for one resource. For me, it'd be tough to choose between this and Concentrate. I probably wouldn't put both of them in the same deck, as that'd be too many cards that only affect your dice and not your opponent's.
Tim's Most Wanted #3
Tim: I've been quite eager to find a replacement for Rey, Force Prodigy. Rey does have a good ability, but her dice are awful. Kanan's dice have the same damage potential, but have no modified sides. While you can chain a lot of actions with Rey, I think that Kanan will be useful without having to constantly put upgrades on him. I'm looking forward to testing him out in my Maz/Snap deck (along with Planetary Uprising, etc).
Jaydee: Kanan was on my top five too, but I was sure you would cover it better. Anything to get rid of Rey's (Force Prodigy) awful, cheap dice.
Jaydee's Most Wanted #3
Jaydee: Finally SLJ is here, awesome artwork and a ton of damage with a horrific action ability. Will be fun to see what concoctions people come up with for him…I know I've got a few in mind.
Tim: Party's over, indeed! With three good melee damage sides (including a four damage side for one resource) Mace Windu is going to be a wrecking ball. His ability also adds a certain finality to proceedings, preventing things like shields, Force Illusion, and Armor Plating from staving off death. However, at 22 points for the elite version it's going to be difficult to find a good partner for him. Perhaps Rebel Trooper for guardian and access to red (and Electrostaff)?
Tim's Most Wanted #2
Tim: This character is pure control and is going to be fun to use, but probably not fun to play against. Players that know the meta should be able to make educated guesses about the cards that their opponent is likely to have, but there's always cards like Friends In Low Places or As I Have Foreseen to make certain. The obvious partner for Thrawn is Unkar Plutt, but Kylo Ren, Vader's Disciple, could be an interesting choice.
Jaydee: You have no soul! Thrawn opponents be prepared to flip the tables and whine about selling your collections.
Tim: He definitely has the potential to be a negative play experience (NPE).
Jaydee: AKA painful.
Jaydee's Most Wanted #2
Jaydee: The Ronseal effect (does exactly what it says on the tin) for a blue weapons deck. For freeeeeeee! No more waiting on that big-hitting lightsaber to pop out of your deck. Rey's Lightsaber I'm looking at you.
Tim: This card has caused some minor controversy, mostly because of its shuffle effect (the first one in Destiny so far, if I remember rightly?). This is going to be a staple in pretty much any deck that can run it (FN-2199 decks will probably love it).
Tim's Most Wanted #1
Tim: Woo, vehicles! Hera is going to help you make use of all the juicy vehicles that will be available once Empire at War hits. Her special ability could be seen as a worse version of Poe's ability, but it does open up options that Poe can't use, such as Recycle or Reckless Reentry. Personally, I'm going to try Hera in a mono-red team with Poe, but the most popular team with her in will probably be eHera/eMaz/Rookie Pilot. Either way, she's going to be a lot of fun!
Jaydee: Good to see Hera been added, her character is pretty cool in Rebels. Her ability is fantastic to the levels that I'm going to go out of my depth and try out a vehicle deck for sure…Tim, any chance you wanna trade back the Falcons?
Tim: Zero chance.
Jaydee's Most Wanted #1
Jaydee: I've been waiting on this gal since I started playing the game, Ashoka shares the position of my favourite character in Star Wars alongside Darth Maul. Her ability makes her useful as either elite or a simple single dice, and to top it off she is the first character I'll be making a deck with.
Tim: There's been a lot of debate about whether it's best to run her with one or two character dice. Without testing, I'm not sure, but the first build I'd be tempted to go with would include her at one die alongside two Padawans. You're going to want to devote a fair amount of resources to readying Ahsoka every turn, so anything that saves you money will be useful, hence the Padawans and probably cards like It Binds All Things. Blue heroes got another boost in this set with Funeral Pyre, which basically gives redeploy to an upgrade that doesn't have it. Ahsoka is definitely one to keep an eye on.
Summary
That concludes our first article on Tabletop Timesinks, we hoped you enjoyed it. Expect to see regular Star Wars Destiny content from us here, including tournament reports, deck ideas, card discussion, and more!
Cheers!
Tim & Jaydee
(CNN) "I would rather not eat for a week than get my phone taken away. It's really bad," said Gia, a13-year-old. "I literally feel like I'm going to die."
"When I get my phone taken away, I feel kind of naked," said Kyla, another 13-year-old. "I do feel kind of empty without my phone."
Both participated in " #Being13: Inside the Secret World of Teens ," a first-of-its-kind CNN study on social media and teens.
More than 200 eighth graders from across the country allowed their social media feeds to be studied by child development experts who partnered with CNN. This is the first large scale study to analyze what kids actually say to each other on social media and why it matters so deeply to them.
"I think they're addicted to the peer connection and affirmation they're able to get via social media," said child clinical psychologist Marion Underwood, the study's co-author. "To know what each other are doing, where they stand, to know how many people like what they posted, to know how many people followed them today and unfollowed them ... that I think is highly addictive."
Sociologist Robert Faris, a school bullying and youth aggression researcher and the other author of the study, said, "There's a lot of anxiety about what's going on online, when they're not actually online, so that leads to compulsive checking."
Why are teens so anxious about what's happening online? #Being13 found that it's largely due to a need to monitor their own popularity status, and defend themselves against those who challenge it.
61% of teens said they wanted to see if their online posts are getting likes and comments.
36% of teens said they wanted to see if their friends are doing things without them.
21% of teens said they wanted to make sure no one was saying mean things about them.
"This is an age group that has a lot of anxiety about how they fit in, what they rank, what their peer-status is. There is fear in putting yourself out there on social media and they hope for lots of likes and comments and affirmations but there is always the chance that someone could say something mean," Underwood said.
The study was conducted with eighth graders at eight different schools in six states across the country. Participating students, with the permission of their parents, registered their Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts through a secure server created by Smarsh , an electronic archiving company contracted by CNN. The study's co-authors, along with their teams, analyzed an estimated 150,000 social media posts collected over a six month period. In addition, the teens also answered a number of survey questions about their use of social media.
'If they're talking about me, I'm going to talk about them'
The more teens look at social media, the study found, the more distressed they can become. The heaviest social media users admitted to checking their social media feeds more than 100 times a day, sometimes even during school hours. What's more, some teens are so vigilant about those who might be casting them in a negative light, they follow the social media accounts of not only their friends, but also their enemies.
"I want to see what they're talking about and if they're talking about me. Because if they're talking about me, I'm going to talk about them," said Zack, one of this study's teen subjects.
#Being13 also found that teens no longer see a distinction between their lives in the real world versus the online world. But they'll still post online what they admit they'd never say in person.
"Go die. Stop trying to be popular. Holy s**t your (sic) ugly," read one social media post sent to a girl in the study.
"On a serious level you are f**k bouta (sic) get your ass kicked," read a post written by a boy in the study.
"Goddamn u dirty bitch u dirty bitch u dirty bitch," read a post by another boy.
The level of profanity, explicit sexual language and references to drug use surprised the experts, considering the study's subjects were only in eighth grade.
"I didn't realize these kinds of behaviors trickled down. You see this at the high school level but these are kids, who I think of as children, and we saw a lot of adult content on these platforms," Faris said.
'They're sharing this stuff that was supposed to be kept private'
The adult content went far beyond the use of language. #Being13 found that even 13-year-olds are exposed to the sexualized side of the Internet. Fifteen percent of teens in this study reported receiving inappropriate photos, and those that did were nearly 50% more distressed than the rest of the students in this study.
"Receiving these pictures is upsetting, especially at such a young age, because it's something you didn't ask to see, it's something you may have wished you did not open, but you can't erase it out of your mind," Underwood said. "It's illegal, it's worrisome, it's scary, it's dangerous, it's loaded. If you tell an adult, everybody will get in a lot of trouble. So I think it puts them in a really tough position."
In addition to receiving inappropriate photos, some teens from the study told CNN in follow-up interviews about the prevalence of so-called revenge porn.
"What they like to call it is 'exposing.' It's either, like, an ex-girlfriend or an ex-boyfriend, the majority of the time, and what they do is post ... naked pictures of the person," said Morgan, an eighth grade girl in this study. "They're sharing this stuff that was supposed to be kept private between the two, and really shouldn't have happened in the first place, but it did, and now they're spreading it."
Underwood explained that a break-up at age 13 can already be overwhelming, but to combine those feelings with this new, and malicious, form of payback can simply be devastating.
"To have the additional fear that incriminating pictures, that intimate pictures, are out there for others to see just adds to the shame and humiliation," she said. "When they are hurt, when they are furious ... unfortunately that's just perfect ammunition."
Parents 'effectively erased the negative effects'
#Being13 also studied parents of the participating teens. Almost all parents -- 94% -- underestimated the amount of fighting happening over social media. Despite that finding, parents that tried to keep a close eye on their child's social media accounts had a profound effect on their child's psychological well-being.
"Parent monitoring effectively erased the negative effects of online conflicts," Faris said.
Beyond discovering a number of posts and trends that parents might find alarming, #Being13 also found that social media can have plenty of benefits for 13-year-olds.
"It's a way for them to connect with friends. It's a way for them to see what people are doing. It's a way for them to feel affirmed, supported, lifted up," Underwood said. "Young people use social media to exercise positive leadership all the time."
She cautioned though, "there is the occasional hurtful comment, the occasional painful period, experience of exclusion that looms large for most of them."

The PiperWallet is a small black box that does little more than generate numbers and spit out paper. But if you invest in bitcoin – the popular digital currency – it could be a lifesaver.
When you own bitcoins, they're stored at a particular address on the internet, and if you want to spend them or move them, you'll need a cryptographic private key associated with that address. Many people store their keys in "wallets" that sit on their personal computer or on a website somewhere. Some companies, such as Coinbase or Blockchain, now offer free online wallets that are pretty convenient. But those who hold a large number of bitcoins don't like to use conventional wallet services. They're worried these services will be hacked.
>Based on the popular Raspberry Pi hardware kit, this $200 device makes bitcoin wallets out of paper. That way, no one can hack them.
In fact, it's good to be a little paranoid when it comes to storing bitcoins. There's a lot of malicious software out there that sniffs around on computers for ways to steal the digital currency. That's why PiperWallet takes a different tack. Based on the popular Raspberry Pi hardware kit, this $200 device makes bitcoin wallets out of paper. That way, no one can hack them.
In the online world, stealing bitcoins is pretty darned simple. Just ask Bloomberg TV's Adam Johnson. A few months back he quickly had $20 worth of bitcoin stolen when he briefly flashed a private key on television. It's one of the big security problems with bitcoin – the internet's version of cash. If someone steals your coins, they're gone forever.
So, when they own serious amounts of bitcoin, investors go to some pretty extreme lengths to protect their private keys. Charlie Shrem, the now-indicted CEO of the Bitinstant bitcoin exchange, saves his on a ring that he wears on his finger. Others generate their private keys on brand-new computers that they never connect to the internet. PiperWallet wants to help anyone store their keys in a similarly secure way – but with dead trees as the medium.

That tactic could have helped Mt. Gox, the first major bitcoin exchange, which kept its bitcoins in what's known as a "cold wallet". That means that Gox's private key was supposedly stored in a way that it couldn't be accessed by hackers, or by any systems connected to the internet. Except that many of Gox's bitcoins "vanished" – somehow – and Gox was forced to declare bankruptcy, a mess that looks like it will take years to sort out.
Nobody but CEO Mark Karpelles seems to know what happened to Gox, but there may be a lesson here. If the company had simply used a secure paper wallet, perhaps it would still have its bitcoins. That goes double for Gox customers who had stored their bitcoins with the troubled exchange rather than on their own. "If people had stored their coins in PiperWallet, then they wouldn't have lost them on Mt. Gox," says PiperWallet's creator, Chris Cassano.
He has sold about 300 of his PiperWallets to date, mostly to paranoid bitcoin types, or to bitcoin ATM operators who want to give customers a quick and easy way to print out a secure bitcoin wallet. The device is easy to use. You plug it in, push a button, and out comes your wallet complete with digital keys and phone-scannable QR codes. You can print a wallet, use your phone fund it with bitcoins, and then hand it over to a friend or family member or just like cash. It's the perfect gift for your favorite Bloomberg TV reporter.
RANGERS couldn't find a way past Ross County despite a dominating display at Ibrox.
Mark Warburton's side peppered the Staggies goal with chances from the get go but couldn't grab the required goal to dispose of Jim McIntyre's men.
The result leaves Rangers fourth in the Premiership table with six games of the season gone.
The Light Blues started the game strongest and pressed forward, as they would all afternoon. With eight minutes played Josh Windass more than deserved a goal for his endeavour through the middle. He knocked the ball past a first County man to glide past him at pace before by-passing another and rounding Scott Fox in goal. His ultimate shot was cruelly cleared as two defenders lined up to clear in the six yard box.
The midfielder popped up to take the resulting corner and the Gers nearly turned it in at the far post in a frantic opening 10 minutes.
Wes Foderingham pulled off a magnificent save on 27 minutes when the Staggies lifted a looping free-kick into the box right down the middle of the pitch. With the Gers unable to clear their lines the ball fell lose to Alex Schalk and he turned quickly to try and drill the ball into the small gap that had opened up inside the post. The Rangers Number One showed lightening reflexes to scoop the ball away from the base of the upright.
Windass went close twice more before the half hour mark, lashing two shots, one after the other, from just inside the box when County couldn't clear a Rangers corner. His first was blocked and his second was heading for the back of the net until a deflection skewed the ball out.
Rangers were surging forward and Lee Wallace got to the by-line on 31 minutes to play a ball along the chalk and into James Tavernier, who was arriving at the far post. The right-back turned up just in time to meet it but put the ball the wrong side of the post.
The returning Jason Holt linked up well with his new midfield partner of Windass four minutes later and the 22-year-old was unlucky, once again, not to score. Holt laid off a cute short ball to the former Accrington man and he took one touch before curling the ball a few inches wide.
Martyn Waghorn had been somewhat quiet on his first start since early August but cut inside from the right with 40 minutes gone to try and curl a shot beyond Fox. The keeper held the strike though and left the Light Blues going into the break still searching for an opener.
The visitors fired an early warning shot inside the opening moments of the second-half. Craig Curran with a driven shot from the right which just shaved the crossbar and put Foderingham at full stretch.
Waghorn went close for Rangers next with 56 minutes played. Windass played him in on the edge of the area as he sprayed a pass to his right and it allowed the striker to skip into the area. Waghorn took a couple of touches to give himself room before curling a low shot around the defenders. It looked to be sneaking in at far post but Fox somehow touched it around the woodwork.
Clint Hill already has two for the season and nearly had a third from the resulting corner when Barrie McKay placed the ball onto the head of the defender. Hill nodded goalwards but saw his effort cleared off the line by Martin Woods.
With 25 minutes left to play Kenny Miller and Michael O'Halloran entered the fray and the latter nearly made an immediate impact when he cannoned a header off the woodwork. Windass picked out O'Halloran in the middle with a perfectly weighted cross from the right and the forward would have been celebrating if he could have planted his header a couple of inches lower.
Schalk had gone closest to breaking the deadlock for County in the first-half and he did the same in the second on 71 minutes. The visitors hustled to get the ball free out on the right and drive into the box. The Dutchman picked it up inside the area to send a shot flashing goalwards and Foderingham had to have strong palms to tip over the bar.
Rangers were in desperate search of a goal and were racking up the chances but to no avail. They added to the tally with just under 15 minutes to go. Niko Kranjcar swung a dangerous looking corner into the near post from the left and Windass tried to touch the ball into the net. His effort failed and when Danny Wilson tried to follow it up with an overhead kick his shot too was blocked in the goalmouth scramble.
The fourth official signalled five minutes of stoppage time as Ibrox roared the Gers forward but they couldn't make the time count.
RANGERS: Foderingham, Tavernier, Wilson, Hill, Wallace; Halliday, Holt (Kranjcar 73'), Windass; Waghorn (O'Halloran 65'), Garner (Miller 65'), McKay.

I love Xbox Live and have happily used the service since it first went into beta. It has only become better over the years, with features big and small creating what feels like a "service" in the truest sense of the word, one that combines many elements to provide a cohesive online experience. It's difficult to imagine gaming without it, and the innovations it has made have had an undeniable impact on the way all of us play games.
I use it to watch movies and keep in contact with friends. I've played a ton of games and will often scroll through my gaming history, just to be reminded of some of the great times I've had with my console. I have personally invested hundreds of dollars in downloadable content and arcade titles.
Microsoft has worked very hard to make gamers who use their service feel like people instead of numbers by providing so many customization options to allow users to create a real identity. But there is a problem, one that I discovered today, which threatens to destroy all of that identity and reduce users to a second-class status permanently.
This is my personal voyage of discovery into how Microsoft has created a system by which the promise of their so-called superior online service can be easily ripped away from its users, placing them in a position where they stand to lose everything they have ever used it for.
My fiancé has come down with some kind of horrible head cold and taken the day off from work. Unable to do much more than blow her nose and moan with discomfort, using the Netflix streaming service over Live seemed like the perfect way to get a little rest and recovery time. But since she does not use her Gold membership as much as I would like, it expired about a month ago and we had not yet bothered to reinstate the pay service.
No problem, right? All that would need to be done is tossed in a credit card number and we're good to go. Hell, I already had a 12-month subscription card just for the occasion. Type in the code, hit "redeem" and we're off to the races. Or so I thought, until I received an error message stating that my console was unable to retrieve information from Xbox Live.
A call to Xbox customer support eventually revealed the problem: the Microsoft Passport ID associated with the Gamertag, something which existed in this case for the sole purpose of having a subscription to Live, had been closed for inactivity. According to the customer service representative I spoke with, failure to log in to your Passport account for a period of three months essentially closes the account. Live Gamertags are linked to the Passport account, and the system is designed in such a way that a closed account prevents you from performing actions such as adding MS points or signing up for Gold service.
An affected Gamertag still technically exists in some capacity and can even log in to Live as a Silver member (and, presumably, Gold until such time as the subscription expires). Friends lists are active and messages can be sent across the service, but you are in a purgatory where you can never take full advantage of Live ever again. Once closed, Passport accounts can never be re-associated with a Gamertag, even if reinstated.
Microsoft support does offer a solution in these circumstances. All you have to do is register for a new Gamertag, essentially wiping out your entire history as a customer of the company and starting from scratch. In an attempt to be helpful, they cheerfully suggest using one of the free month-long introductory accounts that come with every 360 purchased -- if any are still available on your console.
The potential implications of such a policy are staggering. When Microsoft first introduced the Gamertag system with the launch of Live, it was marketed as your identity on the service. It has become, through the advent of Achievements, a personal gaming history. For those of us who have a passion for this hobby, it's a window into not only our accomplishments but a reflection of who we are as gamers. Every game you have ever played on your 360, for good or ill, is reflected in your Gamertag.
As if it were not bad enough to lose all of that, consider the purchase history, which is also gone. Every XBLA game, DLC item and Marketplace video you have ever downloaded is suddenly at risk. That shiny, new Gamertag will never be able to replace them if they are lost, and the potentially hundreds of dollars spent on these items will also become lost in the ether.
To put things into a larger, societal context, Microsoft has promised us a product that is intended to last forever. But situations like this merely demonstrate that even in a digital landscape where information will conceivably be stored for eternity, we are still expected to follow the consumer-based economic credo of disposable goods when something breaks. If it isn't working, we should happily run out and buy a new one.
This sort of situation should be unacceptable to everyone involved, especially Microsoft. Here is a consumer who is ready and willing to hand them money for their services, but cannot because the system is engineered in a way that prevents them from doing so. That's just bad business.

Arsene Wenger's recent record at Arsenal should not undermine the long-serving manager's ability to help his players develop and fulfill their potential, defender Laurent Koscielny has said.
Despite winning the FA Cup twice in the last three campaigns, Wenger has come under growing pressure for his failure to guide Arsenal to the Premier League title since 2004.
'You may say that we haven't won the title for a long time but he has not just built players, he's built men too,' Koscielny told the club's website.
Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger pictured speaking with Laurent Koscielny during training
Arsenal defender Koscielny has launched a passionate defence of Wenger
'Every player who has played for Arsenal has grown here and has become a man.
'It's a big number (of players). For me and the others, it's a good opportunity to be with him and learn from him. He's passionate about football. He loves football and he loves to watch his team play well with the ball.
'That's why he's here again after 20 years.
'Along with a lot of people, he's helped this club grow with a new stadium, a new training ground, and he built the platform for us to compete for the Premier League and Champions League every year.'
Arsenal, who are fourth in the table, eight points behind leaders Chelsea after 21 games, host 10th-placed Burnley on Sunday.
The NFL and the NFL Referees Association have an agreement in principle "at hand" to end the lockout of the officials, a source told ESPN's Chris Mortensen.
The two sides made enough progress Tuesday night that the regular officials could return to game action as soon as this weekend, according to the report. Replacement referees have been used for the first three weeks of the season.
Controversial calls have been front-and-center in several key games. Monday night's Packers-Seahawks game ended with a questionable touchdown as Seattle's Golden Tate was awarded the score despite Green Bay's M.D. Jennings appearing to have possession and despite a non-call on Tate for pushing off another defender. Administering the rules in a timely fashion has also been an issue for the replacements.
The league and the union have been negotiating over compensation for the officials, with a pension plan being one of the sticking points. Sources told Mortensen that the final hurdle in getting a deal done is "about a little more money."
We'll bring you more on the story as it develops.
Two direct reports to new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — EVP of business development and evangelism Tony Bates and EVP of marketing Tami Reller — are leaving the company, according to numerous sources close to the situation.
It's not clear where either exec is headed, if anywhere immediately. But Nadella told top staff of the changes on Friday; the software giant was planning to announce them Tuesday.
Sources added that EVP of advanced strategy Eric Rudder will temporarily take up Bates' duties, and longtime Microsoft marketing exec Chris Capossela will replace Reller.
Interestingly, Capossela will get all advertising, too, in a major shift in the duties of EVP of advertising and strategy Mark Penn to just EVP of strategy. As I reported earlier this week, Penn has been a much discussed figure inside Microsoft.
Apparently, Penn will get more strategery duties — if you spin it one way for the controversial former political operative, it is a promotion, and if you spin it another, it's a demotion. In the new set-up, he will apparently look at new product areas and strategic investments for Microsoft. So, overall, it seems like a pretty lateral move to me, but with fewer teeth (and Penn can sure bite!).
In any case, Penn will remain on the Senior Leadership Team, called SLT inside the company, for those who report directly to Nadella. The longtime friend of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer came to Microsoft in 2011, first as a strategist.
Reller's departure was not unexpected, given she had been matched by Ballmer in a classic and problematic two-in-a-box face-off with Penn, a set-up that had become uncomfortable and, increasingly, untenable. As I wrote: “Reller took the job, of course, knowing the score, but apparently was focused on balancing Penn's more aggressive tendencies.”
Reller is one of the top women leaders at Microsoft, reporting to Nadella; others include EVP of HR Lisa Brummel and CFO Amy Hood, who are expected to remain in their jobs. Julie Larson-Green, who has been EVP of devices and studios, will be moving to another job under EVP of applications and services Qi Lu (more on his ascension in the Nadella regime soon!). She will not stay on SLT, as had been previously planned, after Nokia exec Stephen Elop arrives to take over that unit.
Reller has been at Microsoft since 2001, working in a number of jobs, including as CMO and CFO for its flagship Windows unit. She came to Microsoft after its acquisition of Great Plains Software, where she had worked since 1984 while still in college.
Sources said she will stay for a while to help with the transition.
Bates will leave immediately, but his departure is also not a huge surprise, given he was one of the internal candidates for CEO. He apparently told Nadella he could not make a long-term commitment to the company. (Good for him not to hang around twiddling his thumbs while looking for another job, as happens far too often at Microsoft and elsewhere.)
While Bates does not seem to have immediate plans that I could garner, he has had several CEO offers in recent months — IPO-bound GoPro among them — and is a well-regarded and well-liked exec in tech. He's done big stints at a range of companies, including Cisco and Internet MCI. He came to Microsoft after it bought Skype, which he ran, in 2011. Bates is an active presence in Silicon Valley social and charitable circles, and had served as a member of the board of YouTube and LoveFilm.
A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment about the changes.
A teenager has created an innovative way for motorists to fight parking tickets in seconds.
Joshua Browder, 18, from North London, created the website donotpay.co.uk after he received numerous parking tickets in the months since passing his driving test.
The website directs motorists to pick 12 options, asks them to fill in their details and then creates a customised appeal – generated by the website – to the relevant council.

The entire process, including signing up to the service, takes less than a minute.
It proved so popular that the website crashed a few days after launching with the student now rapidly expanding its capacity, as well as introducing new features.
Mr Browder, who will study Computer science and economics at California's Stanford University this autumn, said he realised councils operate a “tickets first and ask questions later” policy after receiving 30 tickets parking around his school in Camden.
“I was given the parking tickets for trivial reasons. I have had to spend around one hundred hours of valuable study time writing appeals to these tickets, many of which have been successful,” he said.
“Unfortunately, many recipients of these tickets don't have the time, legal knowledge or energy to appeal,” he added.
The website was built over the summer by the student – who taught himself code aged 12 – had scanned thousands of pages of documents released by Freedom of Information request. He had the legal complexities fine-tuned with the help of a leading traffic lawyer.
Mr Browder intends to keep the website free for users and claims that not only is it quick to use, it also offers the best possible chance for motorists to win their appeals.

Today in New York City, Barnes & Noble introduced the $249 Nook Tablet, an updated version of its 7" Android tablet, and a slew of software updates to its existing products while slashing their prices. In the process, B&N's CEO slammed almost all of the hardware Amazon offers as inadequate and poorly designed. It's a somewhat strange tactic for a company that was also proudly proclaiming that it had the best-selling Android tablet on the market, but B&N is clearly a bit concerned by the recent Amazon product introductions.
B&N was a relative latecomer to the e-reader market, and its original Nook was a somewhat awkward hybrid of an eInk display and a small color screen that helped control it. Since then, however, the company has split its product line, providing an eInk-based Simple Touch and the Nook Color, a 7" color tablet, with the latter beating the Kindle Fire to market by a considerable margin. Although it is Android based, the Nook provides a limited experience, with no access to the official app store. Still, as B&N CEO WIlliam Lynch proudly proclaimed, it became the best-selling Android tablet on the market.
The Nook Color will remain on sale, but it will now be joined by the Nook Tablet, which was introduced today. Priced at $249, the new model will feature some excellent specs: a 1GHz dual core processor, 1GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage, with a further 32GB available via an SD card slot, all packaged with the same screen that the Color model featured. It will also have a significantly updated version of the customized version of Android Gingerbread used by the existing tablet, although that will be made available for existing Color users.
All of these specs were used as clubs to beat on Amazon during the product introduction. The Fire's stats—half the RAM and Flash memory, shorter battery life, heavier weight—were all highlighted for criticism. In fact, Lynch said that, to rush the Fire to market, Amazon used the same reference design and manufacturer that put together the Blackberry Playbook (although that hardware was generally well received, so it's not clear that this is a negative). Given the time spent on Amazon's offerings, it would be tempting to think that the Nook Tablet was rushed to market, but it will be in stores by next week, so clearly this has been in the works for a while.
Beyond the hardware, B&N spent a lot of time on its software and content. Lynch argued that the "Kindle Fire is a vending machine for Amazon's services," contrasting that with B&N's approach, which relies on Netflix and Hulu for video, Pandora and a handful of others for music, and so on. When it comes to content, the company now offers 2.5 million eBooks, and has a large collection of magazines, children's book, graphic novels and comics, and supports third party content through a ePub and PDF renderer.
Most of those new features will be made available on the Nook Color, as the updated operating system will be pushed over WiFi to existing tablet owners. It will come preinstalled on new purchases of the Color, which will see its price drop to $199.
The company still doesn't plan on opening up the table for use with Google's app store. Although developers are anxious to get access to its audience—sales figures for new intros are apparently excellent—B&N is intent on exercising control over what shows up on its tablets.
The company's eInk reader, the Simple Touch, also saw a bit of an update today. It's now got the most recent eInk screen, which is 25 percent fater with refreshes than previous models. That's been paired with a new rendering engine that's designed to improve text readability and speed. As a result, page turns have dropped to 450 milliseconds. Along with the new screen comes a better battery that stretches reading life out to 150 hours. The renderer will be made available to existing owners; the new hardware will see its price drop to $99.
All these prices are a bit more than Amazon's offerings, but B&N argued you're getting what you pay for. The ad-free Simple Touch is cheaper than Amazon's ad-free version, and its Tablet comes with more memory, storage, battery life, and a far better screen (at least according to Lynch). And, if price is really a concern, the Color will remain on sale.

Skin, breasts and thighs are coveted at the Thanksgiving table, but nowhere more so than at Nite Moves, the Latham gentlemen's club that has been offering free turkey dinners to patrons on Thanksgiving since 2004.
"There are a lot of people in our industry, whether it's a customer or the staff, that don't have family to spend the holiday with. We offer a chance to get a nice, hot meal and enjoy the show," owner Steven Dick Jr. said.
The show: scantily clad women performing physics-defying stunts on a slicked-up stripper's pole, lap dances and otherwise unorthodox entertainment on Thanksgiving. (Unless your traditions include Aunt Betty serving apple pie in a g-string and nipple tassels.)
"We used to have the same people come every year and look forward to it, but they've gotten older and moved away. It's different people now. We had one customer who came in every year, an older gentleman. His name was Phil. He always looked forward to coming in. His wife had just passed," said Richard LaMarque, a doorman at the club.
While the holidays are heralded as a time for family and togetherness, what happens to those who have no one to celebrate with? Spending the holidays alone is a dreaded cliché, and Nite Moves gives people the opportunity to feel included.
"The people who are coming in may not come in any other night, but they are here because there is nothing else. If you work all day on Thanksgiving and you don't have any family, you can come here," said Steve Curran, a security guard at the club. "It's nice to have a place where you can go and enjoy yourself and get a little dinner."
The $15 cover — same as every night — nets customers a free Thanksgiving buffet catered by Boston Market. About 50 people (typically men) come in on Thanksgiving night, which is equivalent to a normal night in the industry. The clientele is people who have no families or can't make it home for the holiday – older men, college students and people from other countries.
"We have that market cornered," Dick said.
A 23-year-old customer on the Thursday before Thanksgiving, who asked only to be identified as Jeff, said, "I'll be at my mother's house, but if I didn't have a family I would come here. The entertainment is better. Hell, the food is probably better, too."
Holidays can be lonely, with their emphasis on family, friendship and a sense of belonging. Some people volunteer or eat dinner at charity feasts as a respite from alienation. Others pay cash for the attention of attractive women in a dimly lit club on Thanksgiving.
"People get more of a stigma coming in during daylight hours. But on the holidays, people don't want to be home alone," LaMarque said. "It makes for a less lonely night. It's family, but it also feels familiar because it's food that everyone knows. It's happy."
Vixen, who has been stripping for a year and a half and has no family locally, worked on Thanksgiving last year and finds the atmosphere at the club to be welcoming and inclusive for both the customers and the staff.
"The way I think about it, it's that they — we — have nowhere else to go. I think it feels like Thanksgiving. The other holidays just have a different vibe."
Fiona, a stripper who has been working for almost 20 years, will be working her first Thanksgiving on the pole this year. "We're kind of like family here anyway," she said, and assumed she probably wouldn't eat from the buffet in order to make sure all customers are cared for.
More than marketing, more than for profit, Dick sees the Thanksgiving buffet as a way to keep morale up at an otherwise disconsolate time.
"It only costs a couple of hundred dollars. Even if it's just for the staff, it's a nice thing to do for them," Dick said. "We want to be open for the public, even on the holidays, and that means someone is working. We try to balance the two. Having a turkey dinner is a nice way to go."

BEIJING (Reuters) - A show of force by U.S. stealth jets over the Korean Peninsula after talk of war by Pyongyang has caused only minor concern in China, a measure of Beijing's belief that the North is to blame for the tensions and that hostilities are not imminent.

The presence of U.S. forces in places like South Korea and Japan has long worried Beijing, feeding its fears that it is being surrounded and “contained” by Washington and its allies, especially following the U.S. strategic pivot to Asia.
The flying of B-2 and F-22 stealth jets in joint exercises with South Korea, bringing U.S. military might virtually to China's doorstep, has barely generated a response from Beijing except for a generic call for calm and restraint.
Last month's announcement that the United States would strengthen its anti-missile defenses due to the North's threats also elicited only relatively mild criticism from China.
“All these new actions from the U.S. side are not targeted at China,” said Ni Lexiong, a military expert at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.
“There is no possible threat to China.”
Another well-connected Chinese military expert, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of discussing Chinese defense policy, said China believed the U.S. presence in Korea acted as a necessary restraint on troublesome Pyongyang, hence the lack of criticism from Beijing.
Chinese internet sites are resounding with criticism not of the United States but of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who is derided as “Fatty Kim” or “Fatty The Third”, in reference to his father and grandfather, both previous rulers of the pariah state.
Blame is mostly being put on Kim for leading his country to disaster and the region close to war.
“Fatty Kim, while you are playing games, your people are starving to death,” wrote one user on the popular Twitter-like microblogging site Sina Weibo, blaming Kim for the chronic food insecurity that years of sanctions and economic mismanagement have bought to North Korea.
But speaking too strongly against North Korea in China can have consequences. South Korea's Chosun Ilbo newspaper said on Monday that an editor at China's Study Times had been suspended for arguing in the Financial Times that China abandon North Korea.
FRENEMY
Russia, China's giant neighbor to the north and west, also appears to be setting aside its rivalry with the United States When it comes to issues with North Korea.
Moscow has warned that heightened military activity on the Korean Peninsula was slipping into a vicious cycle, but senior Russian Foreign Ministry official Grigory Logvinov told the RIA news agency on Saturday: “At least at this point, we see that the statements (of Washington) are rather restrained. The position of the American side is a bit reassuring”.
China has long been accustomed to living with its unpredictable “frenemy” neighbor, a country valued as a bulwark against the United States and feared as a source of dangerous instability.
An online survey begun over the weekend by influential Chinese tabloid the Global Times found that more than 80 percent of respondents did not believe the current situation on the Korean Peninsula was serious.
“It's not the first time North Korea has used such strong language. They often say this. I think they are probably playing a game. It's to do with what sort of person Kim Jong-un is, and his young age,” said Jia Qingguo, an international relations professor at the elite Peking University.
“I really don't think they will resort to using their weapons. The possibility is very small.”
Retired Major General Luo Yuan, one of China's most outspoken military figures, expressed a degree of sympathy with North Korea in a blog last week, writing that the country was only trying to push the international community to properly guarantee its security and wanted normal ties with Washington.
War was unlikely, Luo added.
“Once the joint U.S.-South Korean exercises have finished and with birthday celebrations for (late founder of North Korea) Kim Il-sung imminent, the temperature will gradually cool and get back to the status quo of no war, no unification,” he wrote.
Nevertheless, there has been some criticism in China directed at the United States.
One Chinese military expert, Li Jie, who works for a Chinese navy research institution, told the website of Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily that the B-2 sortie was actually aimed more at China that North Korea.
“The ultimate strategic aim is to contain and blockade China, to distract China's attention and slow its development. What the U.S. is most worried about is the further development of China's economy and military strength,” Li said.

The opinion does not seem widely shared, though deciphering the perceptions of China's military top brass is usually difficult.
The People's Liberation Army has, instead of issuing any statements about the Korean peninsula, has in recent days focused its attention on new orders to restrict the use of military license plates on cars, part of a graft crackdown.
“The Chinese people know how to shadow box and know even better about Sun Zi's Art of War, so it (the military) won't make public that which need not be known,” the official China New Service said in a commentary about the Korean tensions.
A Bronx high-school teacher who was accused of sleeping with an underage student two decades ago but remained in the classroom because of a broken disciplinary system was busted again yesterday — this time for allegedly molesting a relative.
Thomas Gibbons, 59, a special-education teacher at JFK HS, was arrested at his Eastchester home Wednesday night and sent to Paterson, NJ — where he allegedly sexually abused a 9-year-old relative two years ago.
His arrest comes just days after city officials launched a massive campaign to give the schools chancellor the power to fire such teachers — in the wake of dozens of similar cases.
By state law, the power to discipline teachers rests with an independent arbitrator — like the one who returned Gibbons to the classroom in 1996 despite accusations that he had a sexual fling with a student at the former William Taft HS in The Bronx that began when she was 15.
Both the Department of Education and the teachers union must jointly agree on an arbitrator. City officials argue the system is broken because often arbitrators don't want to rule against teachers for fear of not getting additional work.
Gibbons was arrested in 1995 after he allegedly grabbed his student lover by her hair, slammed her against a locker and later pointed a gun at her chest.
After Gibbons' arrest, a schools investigator tapped the girl's phone calls and caught the teacher detailing the couple's long alleged sex life.
He also was recorded begging her not to press charges — and she eventually agreed.
By the time the case went before independent arbitrator Margaret Leibowitz, the girl was 20 and she refused to testify.
Leibowitz dismissed the charges even after she heard the recording.
Investigators had also presented her an additional complaint by another Taft student who had accused Gibbons of touching her sexually.
“In my view, the evidence presented is insufficient to prove that [Gibbons] had sex with her when she was a high-school teenager,” Leibowitz wrote.
In the recent case, Gibbons was charged with one count of endangering the welfare of a child and faces a maximum of up to five years behind bars if found guilty.
According to prosecutors, Gibbons would periodically visit relatives in Paterson, where he allegedly abused the little girl between January 2010 and January 2011.
His wife, Kelly Gibbons, was stunned Wednesday night when he was arrested. She is Chinese, speaks little English and was due to give birth Thursday.
“She's is not fully aware of what's going on,” said Marie Petrie, 65, a neighbor and close friend of the couple.
“She thinks it's lies.”

In Canada, one is hard-pressed to conceive of any form of nationalism that is not royalist to the core. Likewise, we ought not be surprised that those who seek to erase Canada's ethnic foundations and political heritage also seek the destruction of its monarchic foundation. Yet for many Canadian defenders of the monarchy, arguments in its defence will fall back on cultural attachment, or perhaps personal admiration of Her Majesty. While these are unquestionably healthy sentiments, it is vital to understand the power of our monarchy as an incarnation of the realm, a symbol of those forces which have shaped our civilization. The monarchy is at once the state's foundation stone, compass, and embodiment. As an institution it bears institutional, ethnocultural, and spiritual power.
Monarchy is the rule of one – the unification of political sovereignty in a single person. Very simply, a monarchic political order implies that all existing institutions – ministries, representative bodies, bureaucracies, military entities, and so on – exist by the will of the monarch and their actions bear at least implicit Royal sanction. Monarchy in this institutional sense is a center, a pole, and an axis of authority around which the state and political order revolves. It provides sovereign authority with a rational and coherent expression.
In states with divisions of sovereignty – republics, federations, or otherwise – it necessarily occurs that various parts of the state end up competing against each other for influence. State vs federal, President vs Congress, judicial vs legislative branches, and so on it goes. This means that the expression of sovereign power becomes internally incoherent, divisive, and conflict-ridden. As a result, factions engage in ever more ruthless behaviour to expand their power: the creation of ever more government agencies, the passing of ever more laws, the seeking out of ever more private backers, and in our time the importing of new populations via mass immigration.
Now it must be addressed that in our country, as well as our Monarch's other territories, the Royal authority is rarely if ever exercised. Daily governance has its parties, factions, and special interests pulling the strings. Yet this is not an effect of monarchy, but a symptom of its diminishment in political life. This becomes evident when one examines how the Crown allows our institutions to function in contrast to our southern neighbour.
The fact of Royal sovereignty has left its mark on our government. We can consider the extensive powers of the Prime Minister in summoning or dissolving Parliament, setting the agenda of the House, and party discipline. A recent critique of Prime Ministerial power even saw fit to compare them to “historical monarchs”. Likewise, the Crown reigns in each individual Province as well as Canada as a whole, cutting through the Gordian knot of state-vs-federal sovereignty which plagued our southern neighbour (even if jurisdictional disputes sometimes occur). The unification of sovereignty in the Crown means that the different levels of government in provinces and at the federal level – as well as the judiciary, civil service, and military – are ultimately carrying out a single, rational, and undivided will (even if currently limited to a very bare and nominal Royal Assent). Canada, unlike many other Western countries, has the institutional framework necessary to reduce and nullify such factionalism through the strengthening of the Crown's role in political life.
We must also consider what formative influences shape the Royal will. Due to its hereditary nature, our monarch is the descendent of Royal forebears. Despite multiple changes of dynasty in Britain, Her Majesty bears the inheritance of generations not only in her office, but in her blood. Her ancestors include Mary, Queen of Scots in the House of Stuart, Robert the Bruce in Scotland, William the Conqueror, and Alfred the Great. The continuity of the Crown through centuries of various Houses and constitutional settlements binds us to the ancestral generations, as well as previous eras of British and European civilization. The link of blood and kingship finds its roots deep in Germanic cultures, preceding not only Canada and Britain but indeed the Anglo-Saxons themselves. Tacitus' Germania notes in the 1st century AD that the Germans “choose their kings by birth, their generals for merit.”
On a personal level, this means that our monarchs tend to be raised in an environment where from birth the history of the family and duties of future generations are emphasized. Unlike the politician who must concentrate on wheeling and dealing – if not outright bribing and manipulating – his way into power, and thereafter keeping it, the monarch is raised in a tradition which emphasizes the inter-generational and long-term well-being of the country. Of course, the individual monarch may well sacrifice this opportunity and rule badly. Indeed, history has seen the collapse of dynasties when a line falls into decadence. Yet even in such cases, successor dynasties quickly seek to establish continuity in order to legitimize themselves. This was even true of such radicals as Cromwell, whose rule would see him swear a pseudo-coronation vow and whose funeral featured a crown and other royal symbols. For the realm at large, the hereditary continuity of the monarch's person reflects the ancestral continuity of its people. Just as Her Majesty today is linked to Alfred the Great and William the Conqueror, so Canada is linked to those who made the journeys from Britain, France, and other shores. Without that continuity there would be neither a monarchy nor a country. And just as our monarchy must be defended, so must the ancestral inheritance.
Finally, we cannot ignore the spiritual component of our monarchy. From the early days of the Anglo-Saxons (and the Britons before them), the Christian faith shaped the hearts and minds of the British Isles. At the time of King Alfred the Great, the role of the monarch as defender and promoter of the faith was already established, as was the notion that the King received Divine sanction. In the words of Dr. Andrew Fraser, “Every Anglo-Saxon king carried his splendour into the life of the Church”. Her Majesty was crowned at Westminster Abbey by the Archbishop of Canterbury, as were her predecessors and as one day her successors will be. Whatever miasma of heresy or decay may have crept into these institutions, this rite still carries immense meaning with it.
The swearing of oaths and anointing with holy oil further emphasize the sacral nature of these rites. The reflection by the Crown of a greater natural and Divine order is itself reflected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: ‘Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law…”. The fundamentals of these rites date back over a thousand years. By accepting a sacred seal and foundation, our monarchy accepts the notion of a natural and transcendent order.
It is not difficult to see why the globalist ideology would seek the abolition of such a symbol from both political life and public consciousness. In the worldview of liberal internationalism, the nation – if it exists at all – is a mere collection of citizens. These citizens are interchangeable and ideally members of a global marketplace unrestricted by borders or states. The result of this is the usurpation of sovereignty from the Crown by the most powerful classes of society.
The Liberal Party's reshaping of Canada did enshrine the English and French linguistic heritages, but did so in a multicultural framework which saw Canada as in no way fundamentally defined by the ethnic and cultural sources of those languages. In stark contrast to this agenda, the sovereign power is tied not only by institutional succession but by blood and personal heritage to a unique history and civilization.
Ultimately, the relationship to transcendence may speak more volumes than either institution or culture. The unceasing attack on the European Christian heritage – itself informed by the Greek, Latin, Celtic, and Germanic cultures which the faith won over – is informed by outrage at the notion of any sense of duty or restriction. It must come as no surprise that the insurgent who seeks to remove the check of monarchy on his power will ultimately seek to remove the check of God. Thus money power and factional intrigue are no longer held to account. The new class thinks in terms of rights instead of duties. Should we wonder that our histories and cultures begin to be eroded and rewritten at will?
When the provinces which became Canada resisted the spirit of 1776 and maintained the monarchic principle, they maintained more than just a sense of loyalty or devotion. They defended the institution which gave their states and societies unity and orientation. They upheld a living embodiment of continuity with their own ancestors. They kept faith in a higher order which ought to be recognized and known.
The royalist of our time, whose ties to these realities have undoubtedly been frayed if not severed, must strive ever harder to understand them. Canada is founded upon them and there is no nationalism which is not ultimately a defense of such foundations. As Ontario's motto still reminds us: “Ut Incepit Fidelis Sic Permanet”.
“Loyal she began; loyal she remains.”

Also, having passes available to purchase before knowing if we need to purchase a pass or not (placing in top 16 overall from DC) or knowing if you'll get an invitation to this event is a little odd, do you have any suggestions regarding that issue?

Yes, passes will be open to the public for purchase.
As for your 2nd question, because of the short time frame between DC and Dallas, the Dallas Passes had to go on sale before DC.

Interview: A two-piece interview with the AWP of mousesports 30.01.2014, 16:30
Hey Chris, the year 2014 just started a few weeks ago but first of all let's talk about the last year. After you and LowLandLions decided to part ways, you got signed by a German EPS-Team. What was the reason that you stopped playing with your Dutch mates and how did you get in contact with the German EPS?
Chris ' chrisJ ' De Jong:
I had played in the 2012 EPS Summer Season with them in CS 1.6 and also went to GameGune with them, although with a slightly different line-up. I remember there were some troubles in the line-up, but that was all between other players. I still had a really good relationship with both Johannes and Niko, and the only reason I didn't play CS:GO EPS with them was because there was a Benelux ESWC Qualifier and I just had the feeling I should play there because it's not very often there's such a qualifier for the Benelux. Months later when they asked me to come and play for n!faculty I was immediately interested, not only because I wanted to play with my old mates again, but also because of the supposed support Well first of all the Dutch team we had back then under LowLandLions was nearly broken because one of our star-players, Kaj 'kajsking' van Staalduynen, had decided to focus more on his job/real-life instead of Counter-Strike. I think that happened basically right after the Copenhagen Games . We then tried playing the RaidCall EMS One Spring qualifiers and some PCWs with different line-ups, with only ferrid and me remaining from LowLandLions' original CS:GO team. We actually finally arrived at a lineup that I thought had at least some potential to compete in the next EMS season and hopefully get a step further than the last time, but at that point I got pm'd by my old teammates: tabseN and LEGIJA I had played in the 2012 EPS Summer Season with them in CS 1.6 and also went to GameGune with them, although with a slightly different line-up. I remember there were some troubles in the line-up, but that was all between other players. I still had a really good relationship with both Johannes and Niko, and the only reason I didn't play CS:GO EPS with them was because there was a Benelux ESWC Qualifier and I just had the feeling I should play there because it's not very often there's such a qualifier for the Benelux. Months later when they asked me to come and play for n!faculty I was immediately interested, not only because I wanted to play with my old mates again, but also because of the supposed support n!faculty could offer.
Back in the days for Playing Ducks... Back in the days for Playing Ducks...
After your stays at n!faculty and Playing Ducks where you were able to pick up the EPS-Titel that's let you to mousesports where you are still active today. Were you proud back in the days when you signed the contract? After all, coming from the 1.6-scene, you already knew that mouz was an established powerhouse in Counter-Strike.
Of course, I'm extremely proud to play under the mousesports flag, and I was really happy when we signed the contract. Since we didn't really live up to the name yet, I don't know, it just feels like we have a lot to prove still, to show that we are worthy of the mouseports name.
For you as well as for the other German teams there's been no real wins so far at international tournaments. At the RaidCall EMS One final and especially in the BYOC tournament at DreamHack Winter you did not perform like you have done in previous online-matches. What are the reasons for this?
The loss against
However, those things didn't matter the most, I think the biggest reason for our losses was that we didn't have somebody fully committed to being IGL in the team. It switched from Hmmm, it was clearly due to a combination of reasons. Regardless of the reasons why we didn't live up to expectations: we have never defeated NiP or UniversalSoldiers online or offline, so I think if people expected us to do so, they were expecting a bit too much perhaps. Of course we hoped to put up more of a fight, but in the first match against NiP with a team that doesn't have that much LAN-experience, it's just difficult; it's hard to argue against that.The loss against Xapso at DreamHack Winter was of course another thing. Even though cadiaN played really well individually, and probably also lead his former team really well, we still made some stupid mistakes or missed shots that we normally wouldn't. We had some serious travel delays and problems with the monitors for the laptops (couldn't get 100/120hz on them) which caused us to sadly miss a lot of sleep and rest, which perhaps could have helped us.However, those things didn't matter the most, I think the biggest reason for our losses was that we didn't have somebody fully committed to being IGL in the team. It switched from crisby to Troubley , but both are not true IGL's in my opinion, even though they both have a good understanding of the game and certainly do not lack in the fragging department.
You have settled in well to the team, especially as a Dutchman who does not speak German perfectly. Is it still difficult to communicate in some situations or do you understand everything now, allowing you to respond quickly when it comes to strategies and situations?
...and nowadays for mousesports ...and nowadays for mousesports
Communication really is not a problem anymore, at least not because of the so-called “language barrier”. Of course there are misunderstandings sometimes in-game, but this is not because I can't understand German or because my teammates can't understand English. I have been playing with LEGIJA for so long now and heard enough regular German conversation that in-game I understand 100% and outside the game I would say about 90%, depending on the topic that is being talked about.
A few days ago you presented cadiaN and cLy as the two new players who will complete your lineup. How did you get in contact with them and why did you choose these two? Particularly the recruitment of cLy was relatively surprising since you guys know very well how his past in CS:GO has been.
Indeed cLy has been a person that has drawn some unwanted attention to himself, sometimes through his own mistakes, and sometimes just by unlucky line-up combinations in his former teams. I had a certain rivalry with cLy myself since the start of CS:GO, but we talked about this and realized we need to work together to hopefully reach a higher level than we previously have done in separate teams. I am happy that we are on good terms now (not that we had any serious “personal” problems), and the cooperation has been working great for the whole team. I'm excited to see what the future will bring for this line-up. Well after we realized gob b and crisby didn't want to, or could not be part of the team anymore, we made it our priority to find a good IGL. This has been the biggest problem for the recent mousesports CS:GO line-up and has been a problem for many of my previous teams. We had some contact with cadiaN, mostly because he managed to kick us out of the BYOC at DH:W with his former team Xapso. We ran some test-games with him and it soon became clear that we had a very good click with this guy, and that he had a certain plan and ambition to become the IGL of this team.Indeed cLy has been a person that has drawn some unwanted attention to himself, sometimes through his own mistakes, and sometimes just by unlucky line-up combinations in his former teams.

In the second part you can read more about the opinion of chrisJ relating to the latest performances of the new lineup. Besides that he is talking about his detractors who still see him as an 'onliner'
In preparation for the EMS One National Finals, which take place in the mid-February, the mousesports team will travel to Berlin to run a bootcamp. Right before that we had the chance to talk to Chris ' chrisJ ' De Jong and ask him several questions. In the two-piece interview, the Dutchman responds to questions about 2013, the new mousesports lineup, as well as future tasks.
Thanks to the Consumerist, who have alerted us to the story of a woman named Janine Sugawara and her lawsuit against PepsiCo, maker of Cap'n Crunch cereals. Turns out Sugawara was operating under the assumption that crunchberries are in fact a real berry (Note that the crunchberries do contain strawberry fruit extract, so it's not completely fruitless). In her suit filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, she claimed that she only recently “learned to her dismay that said ‘berries' were in fact simply brightly-colored cereal balls.” Her claims of misleading and/or false advertisement were unfortunately tossed, however, as the court and the judge have dismissed her case.
In his decision, Judge Morrison England, Jr. wrote:
This Court is not aware of, nor has Plaintiff alleged the existence of, any actual fruit referred to as a “crunchberry.” Furthermore, the “Crunchberries” depicted on the [box] are round, crunchy, brightly-colored cereal balls, and the [box] clearly states both that the Product contains “sweetened corn & oat cereal” and that the cereal is “enlarged to show texture.” Thus, a reasonable consumer would not be deceived into believing that the Product in the instant case contained a fruit that does not exist. . . . So far as this Court has been made aware, there is no such fruit growing in the wild or occurring naturally in any part of the world.
Judge England further noted that there was legal precedent on the matter, as another federal court had previously rejected substantially similar claims directed against the packaging of Froot Loops. That court apparently held that Froot Loops did not contain real froot.
I guess the Grape-Nuts people can sleep easier tonight. Just don't tell me that bumbleberries and dingleberries (because I do eat Dingleberries cereal) aren't real. And then there's the ultimate question: do the snozzberries taste like snozzberries?
Legal scholars wanting to read more on the decision can find it listed as follows: Sugawara v. PepsiCo, Inc., No. 2:08-cv-01335, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43127 (E.D. Cal. May 21, 2009) or simply click here for a pdf version.
Traditions and beliefs trump science and technology in India, even when it concerns launching a rocket into space.
Ahead of the blast-off of the PSLV-C19 satellite launcher, scheduled for Thursday, Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientists visited the Lord Venkateswara temple at Tirumala on Wednesday and sought the benediction of deity Balaji for the satellite's flight into the outer space.
Isro Chairman K Radhakrishnan, who led the team to Tirumala, carried a model of the PSLV-C19 and placed it at the feet of the deity in the sanctum sanctorum. “I came to pray for its successful flight,” Radhakrishnan told reporters later. Special rituals were performed by a team of temple priests led by chief priest Ramana Dikshitulu.
Temple authorities said the ritual by Isro officials was not unusual as it had become a practice for public and private R&D institutions to seek the blessings on the eve of any test launch.
Indian scientists have been known to conduct religious rituals before any significant event, but Radhakrishnan, who has been in the eye of a storm over the recent controversy over Isro's deal with a private entity, has been criticised in the past for exhibiting his religious beliefs openly. Anticipating his elevation as Isro chairman in October 2009, Radhakrishnan, a trained Kathakali dancer, camped at the Krishna temple at Guruvayoor temple, received his appointment order via the temple fax and had himself weighed in bananas in a thanksgiving ceremony called Tulabharam.
The PSLV-C19 is set for launch from Satish Dawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, on Thursday. The rocket will place in orbit a 1,850-kg remote sensing satellite, RISAT-1. The RISAT-1 has a synthetic aperture radar that enables it to take pictures of the earth even in bad weather. It will also act as a spy satellite.
The PSLV will launch a total of three satellites - Resource Sat-2 (RISAT), Youth Sat and X-Sats, into space. The three satellites weighing a total of 1,404 kg will be placed in orbit into space at an altitude of 822 km from the earth.The satellite will, however, send signals only after 25 days.

Graham: Tea Party faces test now to be problem-solvers (Grahamnesty, YOU are the problem!)
Posted on by rabscuttle385
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that the Tea Party needs to commit to being problem-solvers in the new Congress.
On "Face the Nation," Graham was asked about the prospects for bipartisanship come January.
"The House is in revolt," he said of the difficulty of extending the Bush-era tax cuts. "People are pissed off in the House at the estate tax. That's going to carry over a bit."
Graham said that big government and spending is on the "run and retreat," but that the coming months will test the grass-roots movement that helped turn the tide in the midterm election.
"The Tea Party will turn on the Republicans as well as the Democrats, but it's going to be a test of the Tea Party," he said.
"They come up here in large numbers and bring a new energy. I applaud what they did, but they've got to help us solve problems."
Graham said he was hopeful that the debt commission is a starting point, from tax reform to considering changes in Social Security and Medicare.
"We're so far in debt we're never going to get out of it unless we look at each other around this table and say it is time to sacrifice," he said.

The Tea Party points out the problems that the people have with Washingto. We elect our politicians to figure out how to fix those problems. If they can't figure it out, we run them out of office and put in someone that can figure it out. If the Tea Party has to figure it out for them, then we need to replace existing politicans with the Tea Party.

"We're so far in debt we're never going to get out of it unless we look at each other around this table and say it is time to sacrifice," he said. Of course, it's obvious he means it's time for YOU to sacrifice. And it doesn't take a genius to remember that it was the people around that table that incurred the debt in the first place. Some things are so obvious, and yet shouldn't go without saying...

When Lindsey Graham happens to be the go-to guy for the liberal media, you know he can't be trusted. His purpose for the liberal media is to disparage conservatives and weaken the movement. In many ways, he is much more nefarious than McCain, because he actually believes in throwing us under the bus. I think McCain sold us out because he wanted to be president and had to meet in the middle for political expediency. Whatever the truth is, when you got Miss Lindsey and Juan as the self-appointed spokesmen for conservatives, they are going to screw us at some point.

Iowa's prison population could increase by 24 percent over the next decade, a forecast released today by the Iowa Department of Human Rights' Division of Criminal and Juvenile Justice Planning shows. The agency forecasted figures for the prison population for each fiscal year through 2027 by using data on current prison admissions, length of incarceration, and prison releases.
The report showed that if current trends, policies and practices continue, the state will see an increase in the current fiscal year population from 8,371 inmates to 8,611 by June 30, 2018, a rise of less than 3 percent. But the ten-year projection indicates an increase of 24 percent to 10,396 inmates.
It also noted that by next summer, space for women prisoners could be near capacity, while housing for male prisoners statewide would exceed capacity by more than 1,300, or 18 percent.
Among other findings in the report:
The record high number of inmates came in April 2011 with 9,009 people incarcerated. Since that time, the number has declined. The lowest point since then was 8,078 inmates in 2013; a steady increase has occurred since that time.
The proportion of inmates released via parole since FY 2011 has increased, attributing to the low population point at that time.
Increases in admissions since FY 2016 has been largely for lower-level felony and misdemeanor admissions, which carry a shorter average length of stay.
From FY 2016 to FY 2017, there were similar proportions of offenders released via completion of sentence and parole, and a slightly higher number of offenders on work release.
The prison forecast is among tools used by governmental officials to help guide programmatic or policy decisions, the study's authors said, adding that, to date, the Department of Corrections, state government officials and policymakers "have made many efforts to help ensure that the state prison population does not reach the forecasted growth figures."
The report notes that a key function of the prison forecast is to inform public policy decisions that can curb the rate of prison growth and achieve the goal of reducing prison populations while protecting public safety.
The entire report can be found on the Iowa Department of Human Rights website.

Over the weekend, in between tweeting insults at Sen. Bob Corker and running "Mission Accomplished" videos that would have made Leni Riefenstahl proud, Donald Trump tweeted this:
He also told the press corps that he believes chief of staff John Kelly would be around for "7 years," indicating that he assumes he'll have the White House for two terms. Politico's Gabriel DeBenedetti reports that Trump is already gearing up for the 2020 campaign, looking at upcoming midterms in certain states for insight into the best path forward:
Advertisement:
The stepped-up attention to 2020 is partly a recognition that dozens of Democrats are already seriously eyeing presidential runs of their own. But it's also a reflection of the near-obsession with keeping Trump's base voters on his side — a mind-set that permeates the White House, said multiple Republican operatives and lawmakers. What's unclear to Trump-backing Republicans: the degree to which the president's base support in the industrial Midwest is waning or holding fast; whether the young minority voters who failed to show up for Hillary Clinton after supporting Barack Obama will return to the next Democratic nominee; and whether the power of Trump's political celebrity is wearing off.
It's quite clear that Trump dislikes governing and really just wants to hold rallies and have everyone cheer him like a rock star before he goes out to play golf. It's not surprising that he would prefer to think about the 2020 campaign, since that's where all the fun is for him. I think we can be sure that he'll be hitting the trail on a regular basis very soon.
His public feuds with senators from his own party, including Mitch McConnell, John McCain and now Bob Corker, show that Trump has no interest in shoring up his relationship with the Republican establishment and will attack anyone he feels someone has been unfaithful to him. Most elected GOP officials have assiduously avoided doing anything to displease him, following the lead of Speaker Paul Ryan, whose obsequiousness reached new heights last week when he solemnly affirmed that Trump's "heart is in the right place" on racial issues and declared that "he has tremendous compassion," which can be discerned by the fact that he "drops everything" to go to disaster areas.
Trump appreciates that, no doubt, but it won't buy Ryan any goodwill from the president. He should remember that even Trump's most submissive sycophants have been tossed aside without a second thought if he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed one morning.
To the extent that Trump's following any plan or strategy, it would appear that the aforementioned base-stroking is about it. But that will dovetail nicely with the plan outlined by his former senior adviser and keeper of the "alt-right" flame, Steve Bannon, to stoke division within the party and replace many Republican incumbents with people more likely to advance his apocalyptic vision of the future. Bannon's endorsement of the odious wingnut Roy Moore in Alabama is a perfect example: The crazier the better, as far as he's concerned.
On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Bannon has chosen his next candidate: Erik Prince, the founder of the notorious Blackwater security firm that was accused of killing civilians in Iraq. Prince has been under investigation by the government for money laundering and attempts to broker his mercenary services to foreign governments. According to Jeremy Scahill and Matthew Cole of The Intercept, Prince has been "working with a small cadre of loyalists — including a former South African commando, a former Australian air force pilot, and a lawyer with dual citizenship in the U.S. and Israel . . . to secretly rebuild his private CIA and special operations enterprise by setting up foreign shell companies and offering paramilitary services."
Is it any surprise that he's welcomed into Trump's inner circle?
Advertisement:
More recently, Prince has been implicated in the Russia investigation after attempting to set up a back channel between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Seychelles islands. Oh, and he has been pushing the idea of mercenaries taking over many of the duties of the "inefficient" U.S. military, which is unfortunately hamstrung by laws against war crimes. He got Trump interested in his plan to privatize the war in Afghanistan and installing himself as a sort of colonial viceroy -- using the British East India Company as his model -- by telling Trump that there were many minerals available for the taking. (We know how Trump feels about that -- to the victors belong the spoils). Luckily, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis chased Bannon and Prince out the door when they presented him with their nifty plan.
But Prince is just the right combination of radical and crazy for Bannon's total GOP destruction strategy. He's got access to lots of his family's Amway money, and they are far-right evangelicals who have run in Mike Pence's circles for years. (Have we mentioned that Prince's sister is Betsy DeVos, Trump's secretary of education?) Prince could be a real asset to the Trump-Bannon chaos crusade.
Prince is considering a primary challenge to Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a hardcore conservative Republican who has backed Trump every step of the way. Taking on someone like Barrasso could be seen as Bannon's test case -- taking a shot at a random conservative with whom he and Trump have no particular beef, just to prove he can. Installing an unstable radical in office is his specialty, so he might just do it.
Normally, I'd think exchanging Barasso for Prince is no big deal. They would likely vote the same way at least 90 percent of the time. It might keep Prince out of trouble to be stuck in the slow-moving rich man's club of the U.S. Senate, rather than out causing trouble in the real world. But Prince is very rich and he's got a certain creepy charisma, which is Bannon's special presidential recipe. If Trump manages to win again in 2020, Sen. Erik Prince could become a logical successor. Trump wouldn't think twice about throwing the subservient Mike Pence overboard so a macho-man former Navy Seal could follow in his footsteps.
My Terry Brooks Collection
by Stuart Finnie
For those of you who know who I am, this collection will be somewhat familiar to you. For those who do not, I hope you enjoy the photos, appreciate the books and above all else, understand my reasons for this message.
I have been reading Terry's novels for more than thirty years now. And I have loved every single one of them. For me, he is the greatest living storyteller. He is able to continuously and consistently remove his readers from their lives and place them into his world, safe and sound. Yes, his style has changed over the years and the grand, sweeping epics that were The Elfstones of Shannara and the like have been replaced by longer-arcing narratives that really focus on character. I, for one, have embraced that change and now look forward to discovering how Terry will manipulate me to get to love his characters before letting them go. For that, I am eternally grateful to him.
But in addition to reading his work, I have also been collecting. And over the years, I have amassed a library of almost four hundred editions of his books. It is relatively simple to get a collection of signed first editions these days (abebooks and eBay have really helped the market) and as such, a full collection of the signed US 1st/1st copies would cost you around than $2000. But the art in collecting is making things unique, or different in some way. And that is what I have concentrated on over my twenty-odd years of collecting – making the collection as distinctive and special as possible. I love my books. I love what they represent. I love the fact that I have things that no one else has – and no one else can get again. But I hate the fact that I have to sell it.

You see, I am seriously ill. I had cancer in 2010 and although it was treated and I was in remission, it decided to return in mid-2014. I won't go into detail, but it is of an unknown primary, with secondary tumours throughout my internal organs and bones. It is therefore untreatable, and in October of 2014 I was given between six and twelve months to live. We are now three months beyond that, and although I am feeling great and am determined to last as long as I can (just because I can't be bothered dying yet) the time has come to let my collection go. And that makes me really, really sad.
Conservatively, my collection is worth around $58,000 (£40,000). Some notable editions are the US 1st/1st of Sword, signed by Terry and both Hildebrandt brothers (Tim sadly died in 2006) the US 1st/1sts of Elfstones and Wishsong, signed by Terry and Darrell K Sweet (who died in 2011) and the US 1st/1st of Druid signed by Keith Parkinson (who died in 2005). These are editions that obviously can never be replaced. Most of the Steve Stone covers are signed by Steve, too, something that is very rare indeed. My own personal favourite is the proof copy of Elfstones. I have, as I mentioned earlier, been collecting for more than two decades and I have only once seen this book come up for sale (I bought it, of course). Once – in twenty years. It is rare indeed.
There are also lots of other little rarities; including a small HB of Sword and Elfstones that no one (not Terry, nor Steve Stone) knows who published. And a UK Proof of Elves of Cintra, which was the only one Orbit produced. And there are other things like a full-size replica of the Sword of Shannara, made by an Italian blacksmith before it was shut down (he didn't have the licence to reproduce the TM), and a business card signed by Judy-Lyn Del Rey, as well as numerous pieces of marketing material, the Charpentier maps and the not-so-rare but still fun LP and RPG.
Now for the kicker: I need to sell these, and quickly.
I'd love to say that I will only take face value for them, but I know that is not realistic. All I am asking for is a fair price. If I can get £25,000 (approx. $36,000), I would be delighted. I will listen to, and consider, any serious offer, though.
I want two things to happen here: One, to be here when the books get sold – that way I can ensure that they go to a good home, to someone who will not only look after them, but continue building the collection over the coming years; And two, to be able to use the money I get to have something of a ‘living will', whereby I can not only give a large chunk of it to the charities who have helped my over my illness, but to also see those who would be left the money after my death actually enjoy it, whilst I am alive.
And this is an investment, for anyone serious. Kept in their current condition, the books will never decrease in value. Of course, with time, they will increase. And given the fact that Shannara is now on the television, it would be harder to find a more appropriate time to look at such an investment.

If anyone is seriously interested knowing more, and would consider purchasing them, please get in touch with me at balinor513@aol.com. I will listen to any offer and will gladly answer any questions.
All my best to you, my fellow Terry Brooks fans!

Since 1981, the Rodale Institute, America's oldest organic research institute, has conducted North America's longest side-by-side farming systems trial: comparing organic, conventional and, for the last handful of years, GMO agriculture, collecting data on yields, economics, nutrition, soil health and energy.
The foundation of organic agriculture is not only the absence of the use of toxic chemicals in food production, it's also the active practice of soil stewardship. We build the richness of our soils and reduce weed and pest pressures using a variety of techniques, from crop rotations to compost and cover crops, which put nutrients into the soil and increase the living organisms within, in turn nourishing our crops and ultimately ourselves.
ADVERTISEMENT
Here's why:
Cost to farmers: Conventional chemical and GMO farmers are finding it harder to make ends meet. They are experiencing the rising costs of production, including patented seeds and chemicals, herbicide resistant weeds, pesticide resistant pests, and the need for increased land to make a profit. The increased mechanization of farming has reduced the numbers of farm jobs. There is a decrease in the long-term natural capital and viability of farms to produce food, in terms of soil depletion and erosion.
Reducing pesticide and herbicide exposure: Increases in the incidence of rural health disorders such as cancers and Alzheimer's are likely due to agro-chemical exposure, which also carries with it the risk of birth defects. Glyphosate-based herbicides, which are specifically designed to be paired with genetically modified seeds but are also used domestically, have been shown to cause DNA damage, infertility, low sperm count and prostrate or testicular cancer in rats. Further, pesticides are now so pervasive in our environment that they are found in human breast milk and umbilical cord blood. Atrazine, another commonly used agro-chemical, turns male frogs into females at 1 part per billion. Current water safety requirements are set at 3 parts per billion. Organic farmers do not use these chemicals.
Life-sustaining approach: Organic farmers invest in truly life-affirming techniques, which build crop resilience, soil health, biodiversity, increased farm jobs and no toxic chemicals. Organic food production and consumption has been responsible for the reduction in chemical use by millions of pounds per year. According to the Rodale Institute's Farming Systems Trial report, after 30 years of continual research, organic systems use 45 percent less energy than conventional systems, which emit nearly 40 percent more greenhouse gases per pound of crop produced compared to organic systems.
Healthier farms, farmers and food: Organic agriculture, as exemplified by the Rodale Institute, leads to healthy soil, healthy food and healthy people. Organic crops tend to perform equal to or better than those produced with chemicals or GMO varieties during good weather years. Significantly, organically stewarded soils result in crops that out-perform chemical and GMO production in years of high stress such as drought and flood. It is naive to think that we can “feed the world” forever using fossil fuel dependent means and increasingly toxic fossil fuel-based chemicals.
Carbon sequestration: There's a thick blanket of greenhouse gases around the planet. Some argue this is causing global climate change, others that the carbon dioxide levels of our air are rising to life-destroying levels. Global oxygen levels are vastly reduced, while C02 levels have exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm), with safe levels being 350 ppm. Wherever one is on the political spectrum, we all need to breathe and to find a way to put what is “up here” back “down there.”
While there may be some very high-tech, capital-intensive ways of sequestering carbon, the easiest, cheapest and most beneficial method is enrolling the help of plants. Carbon is a building block of all life. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon into leaves and stems and roots and flowers, through photosynthesis. These plants may be food for us to eat, or food for the soil. Regenerative organic agriculture methods optimize a farmer's ability to sequester carbon back into the soil.
One of my friends manages a 2,200 acre farm, growing organic commodity crops while conducting carbon capture, farm economic vitality and soil remediation research. The crops are presently sequestering 15 tons of carbon per acre per year, further enriching the soil and eliminating the need to use synthetic fertilizer.
While rising C02 levels challenge our globe, as we transition to earth-regenerating, soil-building organic agricultural practices, carbon becomes a resource. Through its capture in plants, we increase the nutrient levels of our food, improve the resilience of our farms and assure long-term health of our soils, so we can feed the world.
Photosynthesis functions optimally in temperatures ranging from 50-68 degrees Fahrenheit and stops during extreme heat and cold. This natural process is at risk with rising global temperatures. We need to rapidly transition as many acres as possible to regenerative organic agricultural practices, in order to recreate truly life-supporting conditions on our planet.
Washington's most important role is to work to create policy and mechanisms that help farmers to move away from soil-destroying agricultural practices and transition farms to regenerative organic agriculture, which will sequester carbon and increase planetary and human health while increasing food security.
So this week, as the Organic Trade Association hosts its policy day on Capitol Hill, you will have the opportunity to say “yes” to Organic.

Robert Elswit, a member of the American Society of Cinematographers, won the Academy Award this year as cinematographer for There Will Be Blood. My favorite movie of 2007; the film will be released on DVD on April 7 by Paramount Home Entertainment. The movie was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won two. In addition to Elswit' well deserved win, Daniel Day-Lewis took home the Oscar for Best Actor in a feature film.
The general public can rarely rattle off the name of the cinematographer of their favorite film, yet without their magic to light a romantic scene properly, create tension in a thriller or embellish the dark surroundings in a scary movie, there would be no enjoyment of any film.
Elswit came by his love of movies naturally; his parents were theatrical agents so he grew up around the business. " I loved the old movies from the 30s and 40s that played on TV every week. So early on it was a dream of mine to be part of that business," said Elswit.
He started filming TV programs in the 1980s and soon Elswit was working on feature films. His vast repertoire includes such films as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Boogie Nights, Good Night, and Good Luck, Syriana and Michael Clayton. Elswit and director Paul Anderson work well together.
"I've worked on all of Paul's films," he said. "I always know there will be some kind of critical acclaim for Paul's movie, like a Berlin film festival award or something but there's little chance it'll get the kind of response that this film got. I was surprised and pleased."
Almost all of There Will Be Blood was shot in the small Texas Town of Marfa. This made Elswit's job much easier than to have to move to different locations.
"Production designer Jack Fisk found this incredible little town that was once an oil town, and we built all of our sets there and used many of the extras whose families had worked in the oil fields. If that hadn't been done so well, I don't think the film would have worked out nearly as well."
In addition to many early California-looking scenes, many were about oil – running along the ground, gurgling in the wells or shooting high in the sky. I was curious what was used for the oil.
"Steve Cremin, the special effects guy, discovered on the movie Jarhead, where the troops were covered with oil, that there's a compound fast food restaurants use to color milkshakes. But it's an organic food product so it was environmentally friendly. It really looks like oil. Steve is an amazing special effects guy that did everything including all the work to set the oil well on fire and keep it contained."
There's a scene in the beginning of the film where Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis) is digging in a deep hole to plant dynamite. How difficult was that to light and film?
"There was already a hole from a real silver mind on the property that was about 75 feet down and 100 yrs old, pretty much the way you see Daniel dig it," said Elswit. "It was done by men who used small sticks to dig it. At the bottom, someone in the 30s had created a tunnel under the same mountain that cut through the bottom of the shaft, and that's what we used as access for our crew to shoot and build scaffolding for lighting units."
Daniel Day-Lewis played the role of the hardened oil man with such aplomb he received unanimous praise and awards from critics groups across the globe. How much of that performance rests on the shoulders of the cinematographer?
"Unless it's a romantic film where you want to light say George Clooney to look like George Clooney, none," said Elswit. "With today's movies being more realistic, it's a balancing act. But most of my movies are not about beautiful people, it's about mood, atmosphere and place and that's what you have to capture."
I think it's safe to assume that Britt is not used to being overlooked, but honestly, that goes part and parcel with the social experiment that is The Bachelor. Just because you feel "confident" and refer to yourself as a "frontrunner" doesn't mean the Bachelor isn't going to do what he's there to do, which is got to know better the women he's interested in. You don't see other frontrunners (Whitney? Becca?) spending their sole one-on-one time of the week using Manipulation 101 to plant a seed of doubt about another girl.
In the span of about 3 minutes, Britt impressively manages to:
massively judge Kaitlyn, insinuating her behavior doesn't make her wife material imply Chris is interested in Kaitlyn because she's willing to strip for a game of Truth of Dare and because she talks about sex passively threaten that other girls "were thinking of going home" say "we've all been wondering" as though she's the voice of 12 other women. (None of whom voiced such complaints, mind you. You can bet those ITMs would have aired if they had.)
Furthermore, to make it about Kaitlyn "taking her clothes off" and "talking about sex" as arguments is an insult to Chris' judgment since those are things he could plainly see. If Britt felt Kaitlyn were, say, two-faced or manipulative (cough, cough)—attributes Chris wasn't privy to but should be made aware of for his own good, I could maybe understand that. (Still not okay, though) But the gripes she had hardly made Kaitlyn a poor match for him. How does she know what Chris does or doesn't look for in a woman? I've been hearing beef that Kaitlyn has a potty mouth but—news flash—so does Chris. It's a strange example, yes, but my point is clear. The whole thing just reeked of pure jealousy, plain and simple, and was handled the way I imagine Regina George would.
LIVE AND LET LIVE. This is my mantra when I feel myself judging others. Guess what: If the guy chooses you—and you him—it's because you're a good match. Skinny-dipping, winning a race, being a virgin, having suffered a loss in the family, and acting holier than thou should and will make ZERO DIFFERENCE.

Stephanie Kwolek, the DuPont scientist whose invention, Kevlar, has saved countless lives as the essential ingredient in body armor, has died.
Kwolek, of the Sharpley neighborhood in Talleyville, died Wednesday following a brief illness, said her friend, Rita Vasta, who is handling Kwolek's affairs. She was 90.
Kwolek had no remaining family, Vasta said.
"We are all saddened at the passing of DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek, a creative and determined chemist and a true pioneer for women in science," DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman said in a written statement Thursday. "Her synthesis of the first liquid crystal polymer and the invention of DuPont Kevlar highlighted a distinguished career."
Kwolek developed Kevlar, a substance five times stronger than steel, by spinning fiber from a liquid crystalline solution. Kevlar's lightweight, durable qualities have made it an long-lived material used in body armor and other protection equipment used by police and the military.
The discovery came in the mid-1960s when Kwolek was 42, working at DuPont's Experimental Station outside of Wilmington to develop a super-strong fiber to reinforce radial tires.
She invented a solution of rigid-chain polymers that fell from her lab spatula like water. The substance was much thinner than most polymers, and when put into a machine could be spun into strong, stiff material.
She told The News Journal in 2007 that DuPont management "didn't fool around. They immediately assigned a whole group to work on different aspects. ... It was very exciting, let me tell you."
Kevlar's use over time broadened to other applications, including sporting equipment, as it minimizes vibration and can bend without shattering. DuPont recently agreed to serve as a sponsor of the ESPN X Games, where sporting equipment makes liberal use of Kevlar. DuPont will celebrate Kevlar's 50th anniversary next year.
News of Kwolek's death came a day after DuPont Protection Technologies announced that a million bullet-resistant vests have been sold using DuPont Kevlar XP since that version of the product was launched in 2008. Today, most police agencies have adopted mandatory vest requirements.
"When you think about what she has done, it's incredible. There's literally thousands and thousands of people alive because of her," said Ron McBride, former manager of the Kevlar Survivors' Club, a not-for-profit partnership between DuPont and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. The group has documented 3,200 lives saved through use of Kevlar in body armor.
McBride is a former chief of police in Ashland, Kentucky. A vest with Kevlar saved the life of his son, who was serving as a naval operative in Iraq.
"She could look back on her life and say, 'Yeah, I made a difference,' " he said.
Kwolek held just a bachelor's degree from the institution that preceded Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh when she joined DuPont as a chemist in 1946.

Coming from humble roots, and having studied in a one-room schoolhouse, she found an opportunity at DuPont because many men were in the military at the time.
"She was stubborn, she clung on, and she did the work because she found it interesting," said Caroline Angel Burke, project manager at the Museum of Science in Boston, which chose Kwolek as one of a handful of engineers featured in a permanent exhibit.
Kwolek, who stood just 4 feet 11 inches tall, never married.
"In those days for chemists, when you're hot on the trail of something, there's not a lot of time to go dating," Vasta said. "She loved outdoor sports, she had plenty of friends, she socialized. But when it came to lab work, that was 100 percent of her focus."
Vasta, who counted Kwolek as a mentor when they both worked at DuPont in the 1980s, said Kwolek continued to develop Kevlar over the years before her retirement in 1986. She went on to mentor women who wanted to go into the sciences, Vasta said.
Kwolek got a nice lab at DuPont after the discovery, but recognized she was in the company of many other distinguished scientists, Vasta said. Kwolek always said that DuPont compensated her properly for her discovery, Vasta said.
In the 2007 interview, Kwolek was careful to take credit only for the initial discovery of the technology used in the development of Kevlar, crediting the team for taking it further, especially DuPont scientist Herbert Blades.
Kwolek was proud whenever first responders approached her to tell her that her vest saved their lives, Vasta said.
In 1996, Kwolek won the National Medal of Technology "for her contributions to the discovery, development and liquid crystal processing of high-performance aramid fibers, which provide new products worldwide to save lives and benefit humankind." She was only the third DuPont scientist to win a National Medal of Technology or Science, Kullman said.
"She leaves a wonderful legacy of thousands of lives saved and countless injuries prevented by products made possible by her discovery," Kullman said.
In Kwolek's later years, she enjoyed being in her home, Vasta said. She left behind her lab notebooks, and "oh my gosh, they're like literary pieces," she said, noting her fluid handwriting and sketches.
Kwolek was inducted into the the Hall of Fame of Delaware Women on March 27.
Kwolek kept spools of Kevlar fabric at her home, she told The News Journal in 2007. "I never in a thousand years expected that little liquid crystal to develop into what it did," she said.

Science Says: Jack Frost nipping at your nose ever later
FILE - This Monday, Oct. 23, 2017 file photo show fall colors beginning to show along Route 209 in Reilly Township, Schuylkill County, Pa. Across the United States, 2017's first freeze has been arriving further and further into the calendar, according to more than a century of measurements from weather stations nationwide. (David McKeown/Republican-Herald via AP)
WASHINGTON (AP) — Winter is coming ... later. And it's leaving ever earlier.
Across the United States, the year's first freeze has been arriving further and further into the calendar, according to more than a century of measurements from weather stations nationwide.
Scientists say it is yet another sign of the changing climate, and that it has good and bad consequences for the nation. There could be more fruits and vegetables — and also more allergies and pests.
“I'm happy about it,” said Karen Duncan of Streator, Illinois. Her flowers are in bloom because she's had no frost this year yet, just as she had none last year at this time either. On the other hand, she said just last week it was too hot and buggy to go out — in late October, near Chicago.
The trend of ever later first freezes appears to have started around 1980, according to an analysis by The Associated Press of data from 700 weather stations across the U.S. going back to 1895 compiled by Ken Kunkel, a meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information.
To look for nationwide trends, Kunkel compared the first freeze from each of the 700 stations to the station's average for the 20th Century. Some parts of the country experience earlier or later freezes every year, but on average freezes are coming later.
The average first freeze over the last 10 years, from 2007 to 2016, is a week later than the average from 1971 to 1980, which is before Kunkel said the trend became noticeable.
This year, about 40 percent of the Lower 48 states have had a freeze as of Oct. 23, compared to 65 percent in a normal year, according to Jeff Masters, meteorology director of the private service Weather Underground.
Duncan's flowers should be dead by now. According to data from the weather station near her in Ottawa, Illinois, the average first freeze for the 20th century was Oct. 15. The normal from 1981 to 2010 based on NOAA computer simulations was Oct. 19. Since 2010, the average first freeze is on Oct. 26. Last year, the first freeze in Ottawa came on Nov. 12.
Last year was “way off the charts” nationwide, Kunkel said. The average first freeze was two weeks later than the 20th century average, and the last frost of spring was nine days earlier than normal.
Overall the United States freeze season of 2016 was more than a month shorter than the freeze season of 1916. It was most extreme in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon's freeze season was 61 days — two months — shorter than normal.
Global warming has helped push the first frosts later, Kunkel and other scientists said. Also at play, though, are natural short-term changes in air circulation patterns — but they too may be influenced by man-made climate change, they said.
This shrinking freeze season is what climate scientists have long predicted, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado.
A shorter freeze season means a longer growing season and less money spent on heat. But it also hurts some plants that require a certain amount of chill, such as Georgia peaches, said Theresa Crimmins, a University of Arizona ecologist. Crimmins is assistant director of the National Phenology Network . Phenology is the study of the seasons and how plants and animals adapt to timing changes.
Pests that attack trees and spread disease aren't being killed off as early as they normally would be, Crimmins said.
In New England, many trees aren't changing colors as vibrantly as they normally do or used to because some take cues for when to turn from temperature, said Boston University biology professor Richard Primack.
Clusters of late-emerging monarch butterflies are being found far further north than normal for this time of year, and are unlikely to survive their migration to Mexico.
Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said natural variability, especially an El Nino, made last year exceptional for an early freeze, but “it represents the kind of conditions that will be more routine in a decade or two” because of man-made climate change.
“The long-term consequences are really negative,” said Primack, because shorter winters and hotter temperatures are also expected to lead to rising seas that cause worse flooding during heavy storms.
In suburban Boston, Primack and his wife are still eating lettuce, tomatoes and green beans from their garden. And they are getting fresh figs off their backyard tree almost daily.
“These fig trees should be asleep,” Primack said.

Ohio State is still smarting from an upset loss at the hands of Penn State and Buckeye fans are pretty down on their team, but Las Vegas sure isn't.
In odds released Sunday, the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook has Ohio State second, at 3/1, in their odds to win the College Football Playoff, trailing only Alabama, the favorite at 8/5.
How, you may ask, given that the Buckeyes just took one on the chin from the Nittany Lions.
It's simple, really. Las Vegas likes Ohio State to win out, and as of right now, they will be favored for the clash with unbeaten and second-ranked Michigan when they meet at the end of November. In fact, the Buckeyes are actually up from the 10/1 odds they opened at in January.
Should the Buckeyes win out and beat Michigan to end the regular season, Big Ten tie-breakers align favorably with Ohio State's position.
Speaking of the Wolverines, Jim Harbaugh's team is third, per the Westgate, at 5/1, with Washington and Louisville tied for fourth at 7/1.
Disney will release Lucasfilm's animated feature “Strange Magic” on Jan. 23, 2015. The toon, based on a story by George Lucas, was in production when Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4 billion. It will be released through the Touchstone Pictures banner, used by Disney to distribute DreamWorks Pictures' films. Directed by Gary Rydstrom (“Toy Story Toons: Hawaiian Vacation,”), “Strange Magic” is described as a madcap fairy tale musical inspired by “A Midsummer Night's Dream,” with popular songs from the past six decades used to help tell the tale of a colorful cast of goblins, elves, fairies and imps, and their hilarious misadventures sparked by the battle over a powerful potion.
Alan Cumming, Evan Rachel Wood, Kristin Chenoweth, Maya Rudolph, Sam Palladio, Alfred Molina, Elijah Kelley, Bob Einstein, Peter Stormare and newcomer Meredith Anne Bull provide the voices for the characters. Marius de Vries (“Moulin Rouge”) serves as both the musical director and composer. Rydstrom wrote the script with David Berenbaum (“Elf”) and Irene Mecchi (“Brave,” “The Lion King”).
Lucasfilm Animation Singapore and Industrial Light & Magic, which created the CGI animation for “Rango,” worked on “Strange Magic.”
Mark Miller (associate producer “Mars Attacks!”) produced the film while Lucas serves as executive producer. The announcement of the project comes just days after Disney secured the Internet domain name for “Strange Magic,” which caused Disney observers, the blogosphere and media outlets to speculate that the title was the name of a “Frozen” sequel.
Suicide Squad may have had a record-breaking opening weekend at the box office, but it received a negative response from fans and critics alike, with many expressing disappointment over the limited screen time of Jared Leto's Joker. However, Margot Robbie—who plays Harley Quinn—has an explanation for why her on-screen beau had such a small cameo after being heavily featured in the film's promotional material.
During an appearance on the YouTube series Tipsy Talk, Robbie spoke to host Hazel Hayes about why she thinks many of the Clown Prince of Crime's scenes were cut. “We filmed so much of our backstory,” she said. “They probably realized that the emotional through-line of the story had to be the mission that we were on, and explaining the Enchantress' position and all that kind of stuff. And the [Harley and Joker] backstory stuff, though it's magic and some of the stuff we shot was insane, they are flashbacks…So there's a lot, but it just didn't make sense to confuse the present storyline to incorporate all that.”

Leto also weighed in on the controversy during a recent interview with NME. “I haven't seen the movie yet so I don't know exactly what's been cut out or not, but I do understand it's a bit of an introduction to the Joker—it's a bit more of a supporting part than maybe it could have been if they had used everything,” he said. “But they have a method to their madness.”

Question:
O Virtuous Shaykh, with what do you advise us during this time (in) which trials (fitan) have increased and the people of innovation have become widespread and the death of the scholars? (are increasing)
Answer:
I advise you with the first thing (which is) to have taqwa of Allaah and increase in your supplication to Allaah that He keeps us and you firm upon the religion and that He protects us and you from the evils of trials (fitan).
Then I advise you with seeking knowledge from the people of knowledge and the diligence in seeking knowledge, because one will not fall into trial (fitna) with Allaah's permission (only) if he has the correct knowledge. But if you don't have the correct knowledge, maybe you will fall into trial (fitna) while you are not aware (of it) and (while) you don't know it is trial (fitna). It is upon you to seek knowledge from the people of knowledge and do not become lazy upon seeking knowledge whatever is possible for you.

A former policeman who used his inside knowledge of emergency services staffing in the brutal, premeditated attempted murder of his ex-wife and two children in Brisbane has been jailed for life.
Key points: 44yo Brisbane man tries to kill wife, kids with knives in 2014
Planned attack during police shift changeover to delay response
Had cheated on wife, pawned engagement ring for prostitutes
The 44-year-old man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was a philandering husband who planned to kill his family as a way out of his marital problems, a Brisbane court has heard.
In February 2014, months after he revealed his indiscretions to his then-wife, the 17-year police veteran armed himself with two large kitchen knives and went about attempting to murder her and his nine-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son.
During his sentencing in the Supreme Court in Brisbane on Tuesday, crown prosecutor Dejana Kovac said prior to the attack the man had been seeing prostitutes on a regular basis, had an affair with a colleague, and was a regular watcher of pornography.
Ms Kovac told the court he had even pawned his wife's engagement ring to pay for sex.
"He started to plan to kill his wife and children as a way out of his marital problems," Ms Kovac said.
"The defendant, using his knowledge as a former police officer, determined that the best time to effect the killings would be six o'clock in the morning when the police were changing shifts.
"He armed himself with the two largest and biggest knives he could find in the kitchen — he attacked his wife first because he knew she'd be the hardest person to kill."
The court was told the defendant specifically targeted certain parts of the body, like major arteries, to cause death.
"The attack on her only concluded once the defendant had determined that there was enough blood to indicate the victim would die," Ms Kovac said.
The man then went on to stab his son and daughter who had been woken by the attack on their mother.
Ms Kovac said the girl fought back, begged him to stop and yelled things like "don't, stop — I thought you loved me".
The girl's mother managed to stop the attack by falling over her daughter and then called triple-0.
"The defendant's affect on his victims, on his own family, have been shocking and universally devastating," Ms Kovac said.
Mother carries permanent, gut-wrenching guilt
A victim impact statement written by the man's wife was read by Ms Kovac to the court, where the mother detailed how she had been tortured by the incident.
"I have a permanent, gut-wrenching guilt that I was not able to protect [the children] from their father," the statement said.
"I can never forget the shocking fear on their faces when they saw me.
"My body is littered with scars, I remember counting the number of wounds I had after my stitches were removed — I was chilled by the number — 71."
The mother said her body was a very visible road map of memories that could never be erased.
"I have memories of my daughter's screams of 'please don't kill me, Daddy, please don't kill me, Daddy' — it is soul destroying to see what he did to her little body," the mother said.
Defence concedes attack was 'like a horror movie'
The man's defence barrister Angus Edwards said it was uselessly unproductive to imagine a worse case than this.
"It was like something out of a horror movie," Mr Edwards said.
"It will have an ongoing affect both physically and psychologically on all three of the victims who will no doubt remember this for the rest of their lives."
He told the court his client had a difficult and chaotic childhood and a history of mental health issues, but conceded the maximum penalty of life imprisonment would be appropriate.
The man pleaded guilty to all three attempted murder charges.
Justice Peter Flanagan sentenced the man to life behind bars.

Siri to Initially Support Only Three App Categories on HomePod, Only Support Apple Music
Apple introduced its new SiriKit for HomePod on Monday alongside iOS 11.2 allowing users to access iOS apps with Siri voice commands in three categories: Messaging, Lists and Notes. This indicates that the initial functionalities of Siri on the HomePod will be quite limited. These limitations are further compounded by the fact that in order to build an app for the HomePod, developers are required to already have an iOS app. It appears that Apple views Siri and voice as a feature to be added to other fully formed mobile apps instead of the primary interface.
Siri and HomePod Will Only Support Apple Music
It also means the only music app Siri will support on the HomePod will be Apple Music. So no, Siri will not support Spotify or Pandora, two of the most popular music subscription services globally. HomePod owners can stream music from these services through their phone apps using AirPlay but they will not be able to ask Siri to play a particular artist, playlist or genre on the Spotify app, for example, through voice commands. By only making Apple Music available on the HomePod, Apple is severely limiting its target market.
Spotify has over 60 million paid subscribers and 140 million total monthly active users. Pandora has 80 million monthly listeners. Apple is positioning the HomePod as a smart speaker with great sound quality but with the recent launch of the Sonos One smart speaker and Google Home Max, that no longer makes it unique. The Sonos One is powered by Amazon's Alexa and will play nice with multiple music apps, including Spotify and Pandora. Google Home Max has similar support and includes Google Play Music and YouTube Red.
Is the HomePod the new iPod?
It is telling that in Apple's announcement of the new SiriKit, it describes the HomePod as a “powerful speaker that sounds amazing, adapts to wherever it's playing and provides instant access to Apple Music.” Considering Siri's limited capabilities on the HomePod, Apple makes it seem like the HomePod is just a vehicle to get more people to subscribe to Apple Music – sounds a lot like the iPod and iTunes but this time around it's the HomePod and Apple Music. It could be that this is just Apple's initial approach with the HomePod's launch. This position may change next year with the release of iOS 12 which may include new enhancements to SiriKit in 2018 but as of today, Siri is quite limited. For the 30 million Apple Music subscribers, the HomePod may be their smart speaker of choice. For everybody else, maybe not so much.

I want to put this in no uncertain terms: Manny Pacquiao is the fighter who should be remembered as defining this generation of boxers.
Yes, he's lost a couple recently, and no, he's not undefeated. His incredible winning streak beginning in 2005 was broken, but you have to pick your fights really carefully if you want to stay undefeated forever (and use that fact alone to sell tickets to fight).
No, I hope that Manny Pacquiao will be remembered for the paradigm shift in strategy and technique which he brought to the boxing world. There has never been a southpaw as adept in the use of angles to create punching opportunities as Pacquiao. There might not have been any boxer to date with the same understanding and discipline in footwork.
Pacquiao demonstrating his perpetual foot motion. He keeps turning Bradley and improving his ring position.
In reality though, ten years from now we will probably see his incredible results written off as a purely athletic feat rather than a strategic or technical one, and nothing will change at all.
So What's New?
Manny Pacquiao is something special. A southpaw volume puncher with the footwork and angling of an orthodox fighter who has had to learn every trick in the book. Why is that so strange?
Well, southpaw fighters are born into the fight game with a natural advantage. Their left hand—the one which is easiest to sneak through the guard of an orthodox fighter—is their power hand. All they need do is step their lead foot outside of the opponent's lead foot, bring their left shoulder in line between their opponent's shoulders, and throw a left speedball at the opponent's chin, chest or guts.
An orthodox fighter spends his entire career fighting and training with other orthodox fighters. He is accustomed to stopping shorter, weaker left jabs with his glove, and circling towards the opponent's left hand to mitigate the threat of their right. Everything that an orthodox fighter is most practised in only serves to make him an easier mark for the southpaw left straight.
And that was, for the most part, as far as we had come. The first southpaw to have any real success in boxing was Lew Tendler, who gained a fearsome reputation for his great left hand and little else. Today, most southpaws are all about using the lead hand to backhand jabs and slap at the opponent's lead hand, then lower the boom with the powerful rear hand.
You get the occasional southpaw who has a great southpaw right hook (an inconsistent but surprising punch) but many of them lack dexterity in their left hand, like Victor Ortiz. We're a hundred years on from Lew Tendler, and most of our southpaws are still minimalists in the amount of tools they bring to the table.
Enter Pacquiao
To make out that Pacquiao was a complete break with this trend would be a lie. Pacquiao was the epitome of a one handed southpaw. He was awkward to deal with, had a shotgun left straight, and knocked a lot of people out. But he was still just another one trick pony.
Once he started to fight the calibre of fighter who could actually deal with that, Pacquiao started having trouble. Enter Freddie Roach and the so-called Manila Ice.
This was the name that Roach gave to Pacquiao's lead hook... after he taught Pacquiao to use it of course. Roach had an excellent lead hook during his time as a boxer, and had learned under Eddie Futch who trained dozens of great hookers (Joe Frazier being the most glaringly obvious example). The mechanics of the lead hook are exactly the same on a southpaw but the important point in transposing the hook is its context.
Roach taught Pacquiao to look for opportunities to land his right hook, not just to use it in flurries as a space filler between left hands. Against Erik Morales, particularly in the third fight of their trilogy, Pacquiao's right hand looked sublime. As Morales circled repeatedly away from Pacquiao's well publicised left hand, he ate an unexpectedly stiff right time and time again.
Each time Morales looked to step outside of Pacquiao's lead foot, the right hook did him in.
But what really changed Pacquiao was that he and Roach didn't keep his new power right in reserve for when his opponent was fleeing from the left. They built a game around setting it up, placing it and creating opportunities to land it as he would for his left straight. And this is where we start to talk geometry...
Power as a Relationship Between Objects
If you want to hit someone hard, you want to place them in front of your punching shoulder. You want them circling towards that side, or your want to get out to the side of them (accomplishing the same sort of angle). Want to hit someone with your right? Get them circling into it or move out to your left.
Shortening the path of the technique in this manner creates a shorter flight time and allows one to punch through the object rather than at it.
You can play around with this on a heavy bag – start swinging it from side to side, then try your left hook as it swings towards your left, feel like a Greek god, then try the same left hook when the bag is swinging right. You will notice a vast difference in the impact. .
Real life punching power is a relationship between two fighters, not simply something that an individual possesses. One man can possess strength and speed, giving him enormous potential power, but if he hits his opponent moving away, that is halved.
The Basic Angles
To land that nap inducing left straight, Pacquiao would need his opponent circling towards it (which, knowing about it, they obviously wouldn't), or he would need to step out to his right, placing the opponent in front of his left hand.
Watch any southpaw with a good left hand to see this in action. But to see it with more polish, watch his left straight against Oscar De La Hoya. Pacquiao steps his lead foot outside De La Hoya's, gets his left shoulder on De La Hoya's center-line, and lands the left straight.
Often he would do this while checking De La Hoya's left hand, and then circle out. The circling out took Pacquiao away from counters, but also allowed him to follow up with another combination, while De La Hoya was turning.
Notice that Pacquiao has lined up his left foot and shoulder with De La Hoya's centreline. His head is outside of De La Hoya's lead shoulder in relative safety.
Notice the exact same slight angle being used, with or without pivoting out afterwards, in this video. HBO's commentary team quipped that this bout was “Death by 1,000 left hands."
Here is a nice instance of that same pivot in action again against Miguel Cotto. Angles are not an offensive or defensive practice, they are both. Both the left straight and the pivot are set up by stepping the lead foot outside of the opponent's.
Pacquiao pivots off, then comes back in as Cotto turns to face him.
With his improved right hand, fighting Pacquiao is a “pick your poison” scenario. Pacquiao's opponents are still a lot more willing to give him the right hand. The left hand is still their main concern and against a southpaw, the lead hands create “crossed swords” and get in each other's way most of the time (hence Pacquiao's famously inaccurate jab).
When opponents begin the standard jabbing while attempting to step outside of his lead foot (in hopes of landing their right straight as a mirror image of what Pacquiao would do with his left) Pacquiao's counter hook flies over the top.
More often than that, though, Pacquiao will use his left straight to step his left foot up almost level, then step out to his left with a right straight. It's a power jab which snaps the opponent's head back if they come in on him after his left straight. It places their head near his right shoulder so that he has amplified power, and it allows him to escape with his side step to the left after the combination if he wants to. Here's a textbook example from his bout with Antonio Margarito.
Notice how on both occasions Pacquiao gets out to his left and snaps Margarito's head back with a nice rising punch.
The 1-2-1 (jab, left straight, jab) while getting out to the left is a staplePacquiao combination. While he doesn't take the power angle (to his opponent's left) with the left straight, the weaker left straight sets up a powerful right jab or hook. This brings us on to one of the truly beautiful wrinkles in Pacquiao's game.
Here it is against Timothy Bradley.
Here is a quick diagram demonstrating the difference between the southpaw right hook as a counter to the opponent's movement to outside the southpaw's lead leg as against Morales (left), and as a lead from inside the opponent's lead leg as in the above gifs of Bradley and Margarito (right).
The Reverse Angles
The angles we talk about in boxing work in two ways. You can shorten the punch, allowing you to punch through the target and normally hit harder. Or you can lengthen the punch, which obviously makes it slower but is pretty unexpected and can loop around opponents' guards.
Pacquiao's left hand is at it's most volatile when his opponent is in front of his left shoulder – in the sights of the cannon as it were. If Pacquiao's opponents see him getting outside of their lead foot they know it's coming.
Here's the beauty. Pacquiao can step the other way. He can hit equally well with both hands from both sides of the opponent, and while moving to those positions.
Take Pacquiao's beautiful long left hand against Ricky Hatton. Notice that Pacquiao steps out to his left, lengthening the path of the left hand, but loops it around where Hatton's right hand should be. It's longer, and slower, but it's almost completely unexpected. Pacquiao had been landing his right hook as he stepped in that direction all night. He changed it up and landed a full left handed swing with nothing in the way.
Here's a quick diagram depicting the difference in length between the southpaw left hand thrown from outside the opponent's lead leg (left), and from inside (right):
Pacquiao loves to get to this angle to fire his left hand nowadays. He does it especially well along the ropes. Notice below how against both Hatton and Cotto, rather than pinning them to the ropes and going in head on, he steps off to his left and lands a hard left as they turn.
But Pacquiao will also use a left straight to step inside the lead leg, setting up his right. In every single round which Pacquiao fights, he will land or attempt a snappy left straight while stepping to the left with his left foot. It's not always a power punch, but it's the complete opposite to the expected step to the outside and pivot. It has come to be one of those movements that you could see in silhouette and know that it was Pacquiao performing it, so familiar is it to those who have seen him fight.
Notice how Pacquiao brings his left foot up with his left punch, squaring up and placing himself to the left, ready to land his right hand.
Here he combines his left with a step to his left side, turns Hatton around, then steps to the inside of Hatton's lead foot again and lands a right hook which wobbles the Brit.
It's the same with Pacquiao's right hand. He can get out to his right side, lining up his left, and as the panic sets in and the opponent starts trying to correct the way that they trained for, he'll throw in a right hook.
Using that same example of a brilliant left straight against De La Hoya, Pacquiao follows with a long right hook from outside of De La Hoya's lead leg, looping it around De La Hoya's guard.
This, more than anything, is why I rate Manny Pacquiao as one of the finest boxers I have ever seen. He could have been a great fighter with just the standard southpaw tropes, but he learned every trick an elite orthodox fighter would be forced to, transposed them to his southpaw stance, and confused the hell out of everyone he fought.
Where most southpaws can get by creating the one angle for the one punch, Pacquiao can and does angle off to either side, with or to set up a punch from either hand.
Timothy Bradley
While I have poured praise of Pacquiao's method, we must talk about the first Bradley match briefly. While the match obviously displayed some questionable judging (thank you, Keith Kizer for your hands-off approach to dealing with corruption and incompetence over the last decade), Bradley did show some effective answers to Pacquiao throughout.
Pacquiao, like any fighter, is still limited. He is a movement-based fighter who likes to be followed. It's part of why he's done so well against men who dwarf him. He gets them to chase, he hammers them with a combination and he angles off before they can touch him.
What Pacquiao is not good at is cutting off the ring. When he is forced to chase, Pacquiao throws himself off balance with his left hand. He can get extremely wild, as he did when he got knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez who was floundering at the time. If you chase a good counterpuncher, you're normally going to get hurt.
It all comes back to balance. When you start throwing your head forward, past your hips, you have a long way to bring your hips under you or pull your head back before you can start moving your feet in any direction other than wildly charging forwards.
Bradley didn't chase Pacquiao. He didn't play the part of the bigger man, and he didn't try to fight too much. When he did stand in front of Pacquiao, the combinations came in and Bradley got lit up. What Bradley did, and what his corner told him to do, was step back when the left straight came in.
Pacquiao cannot cut off the ring at all well, so Bradley almost always had room to step straight backwards. When he did, Pacquiao would often miss, overextend, and eat a counter. They weren't always great counters, and Pacquiao's offence seemed more productive over the course of the fight, but he was showing a chink in the armour and exploiting it.
I don't know how many more good fights Pacquiao has in him. His calves, which obviously play a huge role in his mobility based boxing, have been a cause for concern for a while, and he seems to have slowed down a little. But he put on a boxing master class against Brandon Rios at the end of last year, with none of the wildness which plagued him through his previous two bouts.
This weekend we get to see if Timothy Bradley can stick to his game-plan more effectively, adopt a new strategy, or walk away as a curious but forgettable footnote on Pacquiao's legacy.

We at Twitchy have covered quite a few stories about student groups that have presented lists of demands to university administrators — apparently many students voluntarily filled out applications to these schools and wrote tuition checks without any idea they were hellish hotbeds of racism, sexual assault, and cafeterias that try to pass off ciabatta bread as a passable substitute for a crispy baguette in Vietnamese dishes.
So far, these showdowns between students and the schools they chose to attend have resulted in resignations and capitulation, so we feel like borrowing the siren from another website to announced that a university president — Oberlin's president — has told disgruntled students they can take a hike, despite the dire warning of a “full and forceful response.”
Inside Higher Ed reported Thursday that Oberlin president Marvin Krislov posted a response to the demands on the school's website explaining that he would not negotiate based on the students' “non-negotiable” list of demands, which included the creation of “special, segregated black-only ‘safe-spaces' across campus,” along with an $8.20 an hour stipend to be paid to organizers of black student protests.

I still can't pronounce its name without adding an extra 'iv' in the middle - 'Survivarium' just sounds so much better to my ears - but I'm still champing at the bit to play this sorta-spiritual-successor to the Stalker series. Survarium is currently undergoing a selective alpha test, but as this tweet from the development team reveals, the rusty iron door to the survivalist MMOFPS is about to be opened a little wider. Head here to register for a chance to join the post-apocalyptic battle for survival, but remember to pack your Geiger counter.
Since the alpha was first opened up, Stalker-style anomalies have been added to the game, among other things. ( These three alpha diaries go into that in more detail.) Only the team-based PvP mode is offered at the moment, but when the full game is finished it will contain co-operative and "freeplay" modes too. Exciting stuff.

Mark and Michele Sellers open Grand Rapids Brewing Co 7 Gallery: Mark and Michele Sellers open Grand Rapids Brewing Co
Editor's note: MLive readers and hubs chose 13 Michiganders to Watch in 2013. You'll see mini-profiles of the choices all this week. For the entire list, which we'll update every day with profile links, click here.
Mark Sellers, 44, of Grand Rapids
Bar/brewery owner
Sellers, a former Chicago hedge fund manager, has become the king of the Grand Rapids Arena District after spending millions to open HopCat, Stella's Lounge, buy McFadden's Pub, and help finance the Pyramid Scheme venue, and most recently, reboot the defunct Grand Rapids Brewing Co.
Prodded by Sellers, HopCat fans helped christen Grand Rapids with the honorary crown of "Beer City USA 2012," a title that helped draw microbrew lovers from around the country to West Michigan, where the beer industry is experiencing a surge in interest, investment and employment.
In 2013, Sellers is bringing his successful formula — he only opens bars he'd want to hang out in — to Lansing where he plans to revive Lansing Brewing Co. and open a second HopCat location.
Five things to know about Mark Sellers:
• He controls the Titanic, kind of. Sellers is chairman of Premier Exhibitions Inc., a company with exclusive salvage rights to the Titanic shipwreck, and which hosts the traveling museum exhibition coming to Grand Rapids in 2013. Through the same company, he controls the Bodies Revealed exhibition that visited Grand Rapids in 2010.
• He plays a mean piano. Sellers, a 1986 East Kentwood High School graduate, dropped out of MSU after a year and went to Berklee College of Music in Boston for a semester before moving to Los Angeles to play music and live the life of a “wandering hippie.” He returned and graduated from MSU in 1998 and earned an MBA from Northwestern University.
• The bar business was a steep learning curve. HopCat sets record sales numbers now (did $3.3 million in 2011), but the bar nearly went broke the first year. Sellers had to pump $50,000 of his own cash into the bar in order to make payroll shortly after opening.
• His wife, Michele, helps keep the business on an even keel. Michele Sellers is heavily involved in the couple's company, BarFly Ventures LLC. She interviews all incoming staff, works with management to develop policy, writes the content for the bars' websites and functions as a kind of stabling agent for her husband. “I am far more risk averse than he is," she admits. Also, it was Michele who was home brewing in college.
• He feels fortunate: “If you'd have told me 10 years ago that I'd own the No. 3 best beer bar in the world and control the Titanic shipwreck, I'd have asked you what you were smoking — none of this was the plan.”
Tomorrow: Roger Curtis, Michigan international Speedway, and Dan Gilbert, Quicken Loans.
FORT COLLINS, Colo., Jan. 11 (UPI) -- Until now, recreating the conditions inside a star required the use of massive lasers -- lasers the size of football stadiums. Experiments at Colorado State University suggest compact lasers can be manipulated to produce similarly extreme conditions.
At sea level, humans experience a single atmosphere of pressure. The energy density inside a stellar core measures in the billions of atmospheres. Recreating these intense conditions is difficult.
Recently, scientists realized they could recreate intense stellar pressure using much smaller lasers by hitting nanowire arrays with ultra-short laser pulses. Researchers measured the X-rays emitted by the irradiated arrays, which revealed the penetration of extreme energies within the microstructures of the nanowires.
Scientists used the results to build numerical models, while predicted more intense irradiation produced by more powerful -- but still compact -- ultrafast lasers would be sufficient to generate pressure more intense than the center of the sun.
The breakthrough -- detailed in the journal Science Advances -- could make high energy and density physics accessible to researchers without assess to the world's biggest lasers. The work could provide a boost to researchers working on ways to generate nuclear fusion using lasers.
The topic isn't one the NFL's MVP considers often. So for a moment, Adrian Peterson nods and gives it deeper thought.
Jerome Felton, Toby Gerhart. Their paths to this point.
Tortuous. Complex. Often frustrating.
Just what is it really like to be Adrian Peterson's fullback? His back-up?
Peterson, the seventh pick of the 2007 draft, the former Rookie of the Year, the five-time Pro Bowler with the $96 million contract and his eyes set on chasing down a 2,500-yard season can't help but shake his head.
“I do think about it sometimes,” Peterson says. “No matter how good of a player you are, sometimes you get stuck and you just have to deal with your situation and keep pushing until that opportunity comes.”
Toby Gerhart (32) still is waiting for his shot to be a starter or even a major contributor, stuck behind Adrian Peterson, while fullback Jerome Felton (42) earned a Pro Bowl berth last year despite never carrying the ball thanks to his blocking for Peterson.
But when will it come, if at all?
After four seasons of frustration with three teams, Jerome Felton almost quit, tiring of bouncing around and having the year-round investments pay so few dividends. In chasing opportunity, he felt like a snorkeler trying to corral a school of minnows with his bare hands. Then he landed in Minnesota in 2012, partnered with Peterson and became an instant Pro Bowler.
Now Felton owns a three-year, $7.5 million contract.
Gerhart? He's been around Peterson — or more exactly behind the star back — since being drafted in 2010. Upward mobility isn't exactly a perk on the Vikings' depth chart. So Gerhart's path toward excellence remains stonewalled.
He enters the final year of his rookie contract with no promises for his football future.
“I feel like I can be a starting back and a premier back in this league,” he says. “We'll see if I get that opportunity.”
Beneath the surface of Peterson's 2012 MVP brilliance was a fascinating reminder about football's random twists of fate. One star's talent provided Felton his golden opportunity. For Gerhart, it's been an electric fence.
“This league can be cruel,” Peterson admits.
Buried under the wait
Felton's first carry last season didn't come during the preseason, the regular season or even during a lopsided playoff loss in Green Bay. Twenty-one games passed. Felton played more than 400 snaps — and took zero handoffs.
His first carry as a Viking, it turns out, came Jan. 27. On a handoff from Russell Wilson. In Honolulu. With Elvis Dumervil bringing him down after a 7-yard gain at the Pro Bowl.
Felton had three other rushes that day, including a 3-yard fourth-quarter touchdown, enough to stimulate new proposals for Vikings coordinator Bill Musgrave.
“Maybe I can lobby for a few more touches,” he jokes.
In reality, Felton surrendered that vision long ago. Sure, after a stellar career at Furman that included a school-record 63 TDs, he had initial visions of becoming a punishing ball carrier in the NFL.
The most optimistic believers saw him in the mold of Jerome Bettis. Felton envisioned a Mike Alstott-type role. But NFL personnel folks felt he fit as nothing more than a rugged blocking fullback. And so quickly, dreams gave way to survival instincts.
Sure, Felton would have loved if his path from draft weekend 2008 to his first Pro Bowl had been quick, painless and without detour. It was everything but.
Those hunches Felton had during the fifth round of the '08 draft that he'd get a call from Arizona or Buffalo? Detroit traded up and phoned instead.
Talk about bad timing. As a rookie, Felton was part of the most discouraging death march in league history. Detroit went 0-16.
Talk about a frustrating fit. Following that collapse, Lions coach Rod Marinelli was fired, his staff gutted. In came new coach Jim Schwartz and offensive coordinator Scott Linehan plus No. 1 pick Matthew Stafford. Just like that, even with Felton sharpening his skills under running backs coach and former Pro Bowl fullback Sam Gash, the need for a road-grating fullback diminished.
Two more seasons passed. The Lions unleashed young receiver Calvin Johnson and went pass-happy.
Felton made it deep into the 2011 preseason before being released.
And then after being claimed on waivers, a promising chance in Carolina derailed when the Panthers' “Smash and Dash” running attack led by DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart morphed into “The Cam Newton Show.”
Felton quickly slid again into irrelevance, was released in November and finished 2011 with a safety-net stop in Indianapolis, wondering if his dream was disintegrating.
“You see it happen to guy all the time,” he says. “You're with a guy one day, he's gone the next and he never pops back up. Anywhere.”
Imagine the pessimism Felton felt as he hit free agency in 2012. Since sixth grade, he had been convinced he'd make it big. During his first four NFL seasons, he often told friends he was one of the best fullbacks in the league.
But he was all too low on proof and suddenly his motivation to attack his training, to stick to a strict diet, to invest everything he had in simply finding a chance dipped.
“Obviously it's a dream to play in the NFL. But I felt like I was being cheated out of the dream,” Felton says. “Look, this league doesn't owe you anything. It never will. But when you dream about it and you work so hard to get here, you feel like I didn't get the experience I thought I was going to have.”
In the shadow
If anyone can relate, it's Gerhart, now in his fourth year as a Peterson insurance policy.
By now it's well-documented that the reigning MVP has announced his quest, as preposterous as it sounds, to rush for 2,500 yards. When Gerhart heard about that goal for the first time, he swallowed hard.
“I was like, ‘Twenty-five-hundred, huh? … That dude's not coming off the field ever this year.'”
It's easy to forget that the last time Gerhart had a chance to be an every-down force, he was a headline stealer. Like Peterson, he is a former Heisman Trophy runner-up, completing his senior season at Stanford in 2009 with 343 carries, 1,913 yards and 28 touchdowns.
In his best game, he gashed Oregon for 223 yards and three TDs on 38 rushes.
Last season? He had 50 carries for 169 yards. That in a year that began with everyone thinking he'd be a workhorse early as Peterson worked back from his torn ACL.
“I worked so hard all offseason preparing to be the guy,” Gerhart says. “I think everyone was expecting career highs for me in every category. It turned out to be the exact opposite.”
Lost in the celebration of the superstar's amazing recovery was the anxiety of the forgotten man. Gerhart's impatience peaked in Week 3 when he lost two fumbles in a minute and a half when called on to close out a 24-13 upset of San Francisco.
“That was a byproduct of being a frustrated runner,” Gerhart says. “No way around it. In that four-minute situation, we're taught to get what we can and shoot down to the ground. Don't try to make a play. For me, I was getting my first carries in a while so I was trying to make something happen. … That was my nightmare game.”
Gerhart always has accepted his role with Vikings coach Leslie Frazier labeling his No. 2 running back “a class guy,” “the ultimate team player,” and “one of those guys you'll always pull for.”
Still, the raw numbers sometimes annoy Gerhart.
At Indianapolis: Five carries, 15 yards. Chicago: Three carries, 17 yards. At Houston: Eight for 31.
So often he's called on as a situational sub, encouraged to get a just a few small chunks. He knows he's a back who gets better as his workload increases, bright enough to solve defenses, rugged enough to wear down tacklers.
Gerhart chuckles thinking about the rough first quarter Peterson had in St. Louis last December. Eight rushes for 8 yards. Then came an 82-yard touchdown burst.
“Now he's averaging 10 yards per carry and everything's great,” Gerhart says. “For me, sometimes it's two carries. You get the zero and the two. And that's it.
“I hear it all the time from my buddies. ‘Stinks you only got two carries. But, hey, you're backing up Adrian Peterson.' Like it's some sort of awesome consolation prize just because it's Adrian.”
No wonder Gerhart's dad, Todd, always has his cell phone ready, the one outlet Toby can always turn to for reassurance. More often than not, though, it's a son persuading his dad that all will ultimately be OK.
“It's funny,” Todd says. “He sells it to me. ‘My time will come. I'll get my shot.' I just listen. He's telling it to me, I think, for his own psychotherapy.”
When the disenchantment rises, Gerhart reminds himself of the thousands of players who had similar NFL dreams but never stuck around this long. He counts his blessings that he's healthy and able to work daily with the best player on the planet.
Naturally, he'll peek around the league.
“Seems like everybody's going to a two-back system but us,” he says. “But with the guy we have, it's hard to go to a two-back share.”
Gerhart will never say so in advance. But when his rookie contract expires next March, he's certain to go on a job hunt. Like Felton in 2012. Restless, eager, seeking opportunity.
“Eventually his day is going to come,” Frazier says. “And he's going to shine. He's a very good back. But part of our existence as an NFL player is understanding the role and accepting that role.”
At long last
Even when the right opportunity with the right fit came at the right time, Felton almost tripped through a trap door. Ten weeks after signing with the Vikings, he spent a Friday night drinking at the Towne Place Suites in Eden Prairie, got an urge for a chicken sandwich and made a 0.92-mile drive to McDonald's.
An employee thought Felton was falling asleep behind the wheel and called police. Felton was arrested and cited for two misdemeanor counts of driving while impaired.
“That could have easily been the end of my career,” he says. “Definitely.”
The next morning Felton called his family in tears. Shaken, he also explained his side to the Vikings' front office. He prayed for a second chance but knew the organization might see his arrest as an unwanted distraction from an unproven journeyman and cut him loose.
Frazier made his disappointment known in front of the entire team.
“But,” he says, “I saw something in Jerome that convinced me he made a mistake and would learn from it. … If we had let him go after that incident, I would have been surprised if he would have gotten picked up.”
Even with the second chance, Felton was exhausted and losing motivation. Peterson knows now the fullback has come so close to quitting on multiple occasions.
“Good thing he didn't,” Peterson says with a smile.
After all, Peterson's 2,097-yard season had Felton's imprints all over it.
Felton's Week 13 smash on Green Bay's A.J. Hawk was his favorite block, part of a 210-yard Peterson eruption. Two weeks prior, he held a key fourth-quarter block on Detroit's Erik Coleman long enough to spring Peterson for a 61-yard game-sealing touchdown. In St. Louis, he lit up Rams linebacker James Laurinaitis, clearing Peterson for that 82-yard score.
In totality, Peterson believes Felton's blocks were “Worth 600-700 yards over the course of the season. Maybe more than that.”
So when a second journey into free agency approached, Felton had zero desire to go elsewhere. Sure, he and his agent played the game, fielding calls from other teams, using the Texans' interest for leverage. But after so many seasons of misery and anxiety, Felton wasn't searching for the highest bidder.
“There's no way to value being comfortable and happy where you're at,” he says. “Now I can relax. Now I can be myself.”
The feeling has been liberating. It's one Gerhart hopes to experience.

(David Grunfeld, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune)
Quarterback Drew Brees surpassed 40,000 passing yards with the New Orleans Saints on Sunday in the first quarter of the Saints' game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Brees had 12,348 passing yards in five seasons with the San Diego Chargers before signing with the Saints for the 2006 season.
Brees reached 40,000 yards in 132 games with the Saints, becoming the fastest player in NFL history to reach such a milestone, according to the league.
New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady will likely hit 50,000 passing yards in his career on Sunday.
Brees entered the day with 52,284 passing yards, fourth on the all-time list.
Inmates in the U.K. have been organizing deliveries of drugs and electronics via small drones, The Sun reports .
Over the weekend, The Sun reported a drone crash at the Category B Bullingdon jail in Bicester, Oxfordshire. The drone contained large amounts of cannabis, as well as cellphones and chargers. “The drone was in a part of the jail without CCTV,” an insider told The Sun. “It was well-planned. We've no idea how many times this method of smuggling has been used before.”
But this crash is just the latest in a string of drone drops–according to the U.K. Ministry of Justice, at least nine drones have attempted to infiltrate prisons in the U.K. in the first half of 2015.
The potential security threat reaches beyond smuggled drugs or luxury items, as drones could also be used to carry guns or other weapons.
For now, the penalty for smuggling illegal supplies into a prison is two years in jail, but parts of the U.K. are calling for more serious consequences. In September, a Prison Service spokesman told the BBC, “We are introducing new legislation to further strengthen our powers, making it illegal to land a drone in prison or to use a drone to drop in psychoactive substances.”

China has ordered a tech tycoon to come home and face the music.
The country's markets watchdog on Monday demanded LeEco founder Jia Yueting return to China before the end of the year to fix his business empire's financial woes.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said that Jia, whose whereabouts are unknown, has not made good on earlier promises to provide interest-free loans to the embattled company.
LeEco did not respond to a request for comment following the unusual public statement from the regulator.
Once dubbed the Netflix (NFLX) of China, LeEco expanded from streaming into a wide array of industries such as movies, smartphones and transportation before it was compromised by heavy debts.
Related: Where Chinese millionaires want to move
Jia made his ambitions known last year when LeEco invested in U.S.-based electric automaker Faraday Future, an apparent attempt to beat Tesla (TSLA) at its own game. At one point, the firm's shopping list also included U.S. electronics firm Vizio.
However, the company ran into trouble thanks to heavy borrowing.
Jia cut his own salary to just 1 yuan (about 15 cents) a year in late 2016. He admitted the company had been "burning money" and had "spent recklessly" on its expansion efforts.
LeEco later pulled the plug on a plan to buy Vizio for $2 billion.
Jia resigned as chairman and CEO amid moves by a Shanghai court to freeze personal assets of more than $180 million.

In October, rich-list compiler Hurun estimated that Jia's fortune had fallen by 95% to just 2 billion yuan ($306 million).

THE mystery surrounding Jobe Watson's Brownlow Medal remains unsolved, with the retiring star insisting he hasn't seen it in years.
Watson, to retire at the end of the season, was stripped last year of his 2012 Brownlow as a result of the Essendon supplements saga.
Jobe done: Bomber great calls it quits
AFL chief Gillon McLachlan earlier this year claimed to have the medal but declined to elaborate on how he ended up with it.
"All I'm saying is, the medal is with me," he said.
The exact whereabouts of the medal – and how it ended up there – has long been a source of intrigue.
Watson's cousin, St Kilda midfielder Seb Ross, last month said there was a chance the medal was hanging over his grandparents' mantle.
Watson's manager Craig Kelly suggested the Essendon veteran's pet bulldog Benson had eaten the medal.
Quizzed on Wednesday, Watson admitted he owed his Nan an explanation, but shed no light on the medal's whereabouts.
"I gave her a replica ... I probably should tell her that it's a fake," he said.
"My dog Benson didn't eat it because I've never had it.
"The last time I saw it was in 2012. I gave it to my parents, so I assumed that they sorted it out."
Watson admitted the turmoil of the supplements saga had almost driven him from the game.
But the pain of being banned from playing stung more than being stripped of the Brownlow, which was later jointly awarded to runners-up Trent Cotchin and Sam Mitchell.
"The medal didn't really matter to me – it wasn't important," Watson said.
"I think the people whose opinion I value and who know me the best, they haven't changed because I had to hand back the Brownlow Medal."

Kansas senator: HHS chief Sebelius should resign

Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., says it's time for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to resign for "gross incompetence" over the rocky start to a centerpiece of President Obama's health care law.
It's not unusual for a GOP senator to call on a member of a Democratic Cabinet to resign, or vice versa. But when the senator and the Cabinet secretary hail from the same state, their families have long been friends, and the senator supported the secretary's confirmation, that's noteworthy.
Sebelius and the Obama administration are taking a lot of blows over the new online health insurance exchanges that launched Oct. 1. Roberts has long been a critic of the health care law, and the computer glitches that have marred the rollout of the online exchanges are his last straw.
"Everything we warned about has come to pass," Roberts said in a statement that was especially critical of Sebelius' much-mocked appearance on The Daily Showwith Jon Stewart. "They can see Obamacare has failed them. We need a secretary who can admit when enough is enough."
Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas, defended the administration's launch of the health insurance exchanges. People have complained about long delays to sign up or not being able to do so at all because the Healthcare.gov website crashes. "Nobody wants Americans to have to wait to sign up," she wrote in an op-ed column for USA TODAY. "Engineers are working day and night to make upgrades. We're adding more servers to enable the system to handle larger loads. And we're upgrading our software as well to make the system more efficient and enable it to handle higher volumes."
Roberts said at Sebelius' confirmation hearing in 2009 that they enjoyed a "special relationship." He was a congressional aide to Keith Sebelius, the secretary's father-in-law, and considers him his "godfather" in politics.

DUNCAN, S.C. -- Marcus Lattimore always envisioned going to New York City and striding across the Radio City Music Hall stage as a first-round draft pick. After all, he was a high school and college legend in the fertile football state of South Carolina.
But, as Lattimore learned, life doesn't unfold as planned or pictured. Instead of the bright lights of the big city, Lattimore spent his draft weekend climbing a mountain in Georgia.
"The whole family, 12 of us, [many] in not-great shape, climbed to the top of Stone Mountain to celebrate the draft," said Lattimore's mother, Yolanda Smith. "We climbed to the top. We made it."
All together.
"This journey is about so much more than me," said Lattimore, who ended up being picked in the fourth round of the 2013 draft by the San Francisco 49ers. "It's about my family, [my hometown] Duncan, my state, South Carolina, everybody that helped me get back to this point. I'm doing it for all of them."
The next family destination is already determined: M&T Stadium in Baltimore.
"Aug. 7, the Baltimore Ravens," Lattimore said without looking at the 49ers' preseason schedule. "That's right there, that's going to be the biggest game. That's the one. I'm all the way back."
From celebration to devastation
Remembering exact dates has become easy for this family. Aug. 7, 2014, would simply be the first preseason game of Lattimore's second NFL season if it weren't for the events of Oct. 27, 2012.
That day started as one of celebration for Lattimore's family. It was game day in Columbia. Lattimore's South Carolina Gamecocks were playing SEC foe Tennessee in a nationally televised game.

It was festive. Lattimore's family was celebrating his health and revival. Lattimore, who had torn the ACL and MCL in his left knee in October 2011, had had three 100-yard rushing games since his return, and it was his birthday weekend.
Lattimore's family and several of his teammates had planned to take advantage of the early kickoff and celebrate Lattimore's 21st birthday, which was two days away, afterward by driving go-karts at a fun park. A teammate's mother had prepared Lattimore's favorite treat, a vanilla ice cream cake.
Then "it became devastation," said Smith, who still bursts into tears at the memory.
Smith, an extroverted woman who introduces herself with hugs, admits she's not a huge football fan. Plus, she's a nervous mother. She does love being in the stands, to visit with friends and to feed her passion for photography.
It was the second quarter and the Gamecocks were winning. Smith, as she usually did when the play was going on, had her back to the field. She was taking photos of her friends. Then, the stadium hushed. Smith's eyes turned the video board, which showed her son on the ground. She then noticed all eyes were on her. Another mother told her to get down to the field.
It is still all a blur for Smith, but she remembers the concerned faces. So many dire looks. Her son being attended to gently by trainers.
The next thing she knew, she was huddled in a side room at Williams-Brice Stadium, with Marcus sobbing.

"That was the hardest part," said Lattimore's stepfather, Vernon Smith. "Marcus was apologizing to his mother for getting hurt. He kept saying, 'I'm sorry, Mama.' That was hard to see."
Instead of celebrating the Gamecocks' victory with go-karts and ice cream cake, Yolanda spent the night in a Columbia hospital holding her son's hand. Doctors at first worried Lattimore might not walk again because of nerve damage.
As he lay on the turf with his right knee shredded worse than his left knee had been 54 weeks earlier, Lattimore -- who believed his football days were done -- spent the cart ride off the field thinking about post-football life. His mind drifted to another one of his dreams: attending culinary school. (Yolanda jokes that her son, who hopes to own a restaurant and admires chef/travel TV personality Anthony Bourdain, only "attempts to cook.")
Although he had torn every ligament and dislocated the knee, there was no nerve damage. By the time he had surgery in November, Lattimore knew he had a chance to continue his pursuit of the NFL. And he simply had too much support to give up.

Does someone keep telling you to “clear your browser cache”? It's an important diagnostic when you're having issues with a website. But what does clearing your browser cache actually mean, and how do you do it for your specific browser?
How to Clear Browser Cache
Whenever you visit a website, your web browser saves certain information from that site on your computer's hard drive in something called the “browser cache.” Most of the time, this is a positive thing, as it helps speed up your web browsing experience by eliminating the need to download the same static resources over and over as you browse around a web page.
For example, a website's logo is unlikely to change – so it makes sense to store this logo locally in your browser cache instead of having your browser download the logo each time you visit a new page. But sometimes this cache can actually cause problems for your browsing experience. That's when you need to clear your browser cache.
Still looking for that perfect WordPress host? Try Kinsta's premium managed WordPress hosting to experience your site without problems. Fully managed

In this entry, we'll first give you a brief introduction of the times when you might need to clear your browser cache. Then, we'll show you how to clear the browser cache of most major browsers. If you want to quickly skip to the “how”, you can click one of the links below, otherwise, we'll start at the beginning.
Why Do You Need to Clear Your Browser Cache?
Most of the time – you never even notice browser caching happening. It runs entirely behind the scenes and usually doesn't affect your browsing experience. But…sometimes things can go wrong.
For example, you might make a change to your site…but you're unable to see that change because your browser is still serving up the cached version of that resource. Or, the cache might have become corrupted and is actually interfering with the proper functioning of a web page.
For those reasons, a good first step whenever you encounter an issue on your own site (or someone else's site) is to clear your browser cache. It won't always fix the issue – but it is an important first diagnostic step to rule out before you assume that a more complicated issue is causing problems.
You'd be surprised how often what you think is a “huge” website bug is actually just a caching issue that goes away as soon as you clear your browser cache.
How to Force Refresh a Single Page
Before you go straight to clearing your entire browser cache, one trick you can try is something called a “force refresh”. Normally, when you refresh a page, your browser still serves up the cached version of the page, rather than downloading all of the assets again. But you can actually bypass the cache and force a complete refresh by using some simple hotkeys:
Windows and Linux browsers: CTRL + F5
Apple Safari: SHIFT + Reload toolbar button
+ toolbar button Chrome and Firefox for Mac: CMD + SHIFT + R
Again, this method only bypasses the cache for the specific page that you're on. It leaves the rest of your browser cache untouched. Therefore, this option is great if you're experiencing issues with just a single page. But if you want to completely reset your experience (say, across an entire site), you're better off just clearing your entire browser cache.
How to Clear Browser Cache for Google Chrome
To clear the browser cache for Google Chrome, get started by clicking the Three Dots icon in the top right of your browser window. Then, find the More Tools option and select Clear browsing data… from the submenu:
Alternatively, you can also use the hotkey combination: CTRL + SHIFT + DEL. Chrome will open up a new tab with a popup window titled Clear Browsing Data. Make sure that only the Cached images and files box is checked. Otherwise, you might accidentally clear your browsing history, saved passwords, cookies, and more:
You can also change the timeframe at the top, though usually the default of 4 weeks is perfectly fine. Then, click the Clear browsing data button to clear your cache. And that's it – your Chrome browser cache is now empty.
How to Clear Browser Cache for Mozilla Firefox
To clear the browser cache for Mozilla Firefox, get started by clicking the Hamburger icon in the top right and selecting History:
Then, in the menu that appears next, select Clear Recent History…
You can also access the menu by using the shortcut: CTRL + SHIFT + DEL. Firefox will then open a popup. In the Time range to clear: drop-down, select Everything. Then, make sure to only check the Cache box to avoid clearing important browsing data. Then, click Clear Now to clear your cache:
And that's it! Your Firefox browser cache is now empty.
How to Clear Browser Cache for Safari
To clear the browser cache for Safari, you have two options. If you're ok with clearing your entire browsing history (including cookies and visited pages), you can take the easy approach and just go to Safari → Clear History:
Again – this method takes a scorched earth approach. In addition to your browser cache, it will also clear your browsing history, cookies, etc. To only empty Safari's browser cache, you'll need to enable the Develop menu by going to Preferences → Advanced and checking the Show Develop Menu in Menu Bar box:
Struggling with downtime and WordPress problems? Kinsta is the hosting solution designed to save you time! Check out our features
Then, you can go to Develop → Empty Caches to clear Safari's browser cache:
How to Clear Browser Cache for Internet Explorer
To clear the browser cache for Internet Explorer, get started by clicking the Gear icon in the top right to access the Tools menu. Then, find Safety and select Delete Browsing History…from the submenu:
You can also access the menu by using the shortcut: CTRL + SHIFT + DEL. Internet Explorer will open a popup. Make sure to only select the Temporary Internet files and website files box to avoid clearing important information. Then, click the Delete button at the bottom:
And your Internet Explorer browser cache is clear!
How to Clear Browser Cache for Microsoft Edge
To clear the browser cache for Microsoft Edge, click the Three Dots icon in the top right of your browser window.
Scroll down and click on Choose what to clear.
Make sure to only select the Cached data and files box to avoid clearing important information. You can also access the menu by using the shortcut: CTRL + SHIFT + DEL. Then, click the Clear button at the bottom.
How to Clear Browser Cache for Opera
To clear the browser cache for Opera, click the Opera icon in the top left, find the More Tools option, and select Clear browsing data from the submenu:
For most cases, you should set Obliterate the following items from: equal to at least the last 4 weeks. Then, make sure to only check the Cached images and files box and then click the Clear browsing data button:
Your Opera browser cache is now empty.
Exxon's CEO Got Congress to Kill an Anti-Corruption Bill the Day He Became Secretary of State
February 21, 2017
Email Copy and paste the text below into a new email message You should really see this: https://act.represent.us/sign/rex-tillerson-exxonmobil-bribery-rule?source=taf . RepresentUs has a smart plan to fix our broken political system. Check it out.
On February 1, 2017, as the Senate was confirming ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be Secretary of State, on the other side of the Capitol Building the House of Representatives was voting to repeal an obscure anti-corruption rule that Tillerson and ExxonMobil had lobbied against for years.
The rule (Section 1504) requires all oil, gas, and mining companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose payments they make to foreign governments while negotiating deals in their countries.
By repealing it Congress is letting ExxonMobil and other companies once again make secret payments to foreign governments. The Senate followed suit just days after the House vote, and the repeal of the anti-corruption rule was signed into law by President Trump on Valentine's Day.
The repeal of this anti-corruption rule will help fill the swamp across the globe.
Fighting global corruption with transparency
Why did Congress pass this anti-corruption rule to begin with?
Back in 2010 a bipartisan group of lawmakers wanted to help solve a problem that affects many developing nations. In countries like Venezuela, Libya, and Nigeria that have the natural resources to boost their economies and pull people out of poverty, the governments were instead becoming corrupt and hoarding the wealth.
It's a phenomenon known as the “resource curse,” and many academic studies have documented it. Countries with economies based around oil and mineral wealth tend to score lower on the U.N. Human Development Index. They also have more corruption and a larger portion of their populations living in poverty.
The lawmakers behind Section 1504 wanted to give people in poor countries the information they needed to hold their governments accountable. It was a creative way to make a difference in the developing world, and according to its authors, Republican Senator Richard Lugar and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, it would also be good for Americans.
“[The resource curse] has empowered anti-American dictators in Iraq, Libya and Syria,” Lugar and Cardin write in The Hill. “It worsens global poverty, which can be a seedbed for terrorism, as in Yemen. It dulls the effect of our foreign assistance, and it can lead to instability that crimps global oil supplies and raises pump prices for American motorists.”
Tillerson and ExxonMobil fight for secrecy
ExxonMobil wasn't the only oil companies opposed Section 1504, but they were by far the most vocal opponent. When Section 1504 was moving through Congress in 2010, Rex Tillerson flew to Washington to lobby against it and try to convince its sponsors to pull the plug. According to Michael Grunwald, reporting for Politico, Tillerson argued that disclosing their payments to foreign governments would put ExxonMobil at a competitive disadvantage. He also said it would make it especially hard for the company to do business in Russia, where the oil industry is closely tied to the government.
As Politifact notes, Tillerson was the only oil executive who actually showed up in person to lobby against the rule while it was advancing in Congress. And even after it passed ExxonMobil worked to stop its implementation by lobbying the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and filing their objections in letters dated Jan. 31, 2011, March 15, 2011 and Oct. 25, 2011. Their most recent comment to the SEC on the matter is dated March 8, 2016.
While Tillerson and ExxonMobil were fighting the rule, their competitors at Shell and BP were telling the SEC that while they weren't thrilled about the rule, they would support it (with some minor changes).
ExxonMobil has had their foreign deals investigated on more than one occasion. In 2003 they were part of an investigation by the US Department of Justice into payments worth $500 million that were made to the President of Equatorial Guinea. And in 2009 Nigeria's economic and financial crimes commission looked into a suspicious lease agreement ExxonMobil received from the government for developing the country's “Crown of Jewels” oil field.
Greasing the skids
It's suspicious that an obscure anti-corruption rule that Tillerson had personally lobbied against was attacked by Congress on the same day Tillerson was confirmed as Secretary of State.
We don't have evidence that Tillerson made a deal to protect his business interests. But we do know that ExxonMobil and Tillerson invested millions of dollars in campaign contributions and lobbying to try to get Congress to repeal Section 1504.
Since 2010, ExxonMobil has spent more than $88 million lobbying Congress and the federal government. Rex Tillerson has contributed personally to many of the politicians in charge of deciding which bills get voted on. He gave $2,700 to House Speaker Paul Ryan in the most recent election and $1,900 to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in 2014, the last time he was up for re-election. Tillerson also gave more than $80,000 to Republican political committees during the 2016 election cycle.
But nothing makes all this lobbying and campaign spending work like a trip through the revolving door. Research shows that when corporate lobbyists take jobs in the government, the companies they used to work for tend to see bigger returns on their lobbying investments.
It looks like ExxonMobil just scored a major victory for their government relations. Tillerson will have the constant ear of President Trump, who will be deciding on major issues affecting the company - including the Russian sanctions - and can lean on Congress to do things like repeal Section 1504.
Tillerson may, after all, be able to return to ExxonMobil once he's done working in the administration. In the divestment documents he filed with the SEC, there appears to be a loophole that would let him rejoin the company.
Phyllis Schlafly, the iconic pro-family activist who rose to fame in the 1970s when she campaigned against the Equal Rights Amendment, has died at age 92, according to the Eagle Forum, the conservative organization she founded.
Schlafly had been an activist since the early Cold War era, but gained national prominence by leading traditional-religious women in the movement against the Equal Rights Amendment. President Reagan praised her campaign against ERA as “brilliant” and called Schalfly “an example to all those who would struggle for an America that is prosperous and free.”
Schlafly rose to national attention in 1964 with her self-published book, "A Choice Not an Echo," that became a manifesto for the far right. The book, which sold three million copies, chronicled the history of the Republican National Convention and is credited for helping conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona earn the 1964 GOP nomination.
She went on to become one of the most influential pro-family activists in the 1980s and 1990s, and her support was courted by all GOP presidential candidates. She authored 27 books and thousands of articles.
Founded in 1972, Eagle Forum focuses on pro-family and socially conservative issues and now has an estimated 80,000 members.
Republican candidate Donald Trump praised the conservative activist in a statement released Monday evening.
"Phyllis Schlafly is a conservative icon who led millions to action, reshaped the conservative movement, and fearlessly battled globalism and the 'kingmakers' on behalf of America's workers and families," the statement read. "I was honored to spend time with her during this campaign as she waged one more great battle for national sovereignty."
Schlafly endorsed Trump at a rally in St. Louis in March, and she co-authored a book called "The Conservative Case for Trump" that is being released Tuesday. Trump says he was "honored to spend time with her."
In April, Schlafly's endorsement purportedly sparked uproar among Ted Cruz supporters on the Eagle Forum board of directors.
In a statement posted on its website Monday afternoon, the Eagle Forum said Schlafly died at her home in St. Louis surrounded by family members.
“Her focus from her earliest days until her final ones was protecting the family, which she understood as the building block of life,” read the statement. “She recognized America as the greatest political embodiment of those values. From military superiority and defense to immigration and trade; from unborn life to the nuclear family and parenthood, Phyllis Schlafly was a courageous and articulate voice for common sense and traditional values.”
Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that Schlafly was “an unflinching champion of many ideas Republicans have long held dear.”
“Through her tireless activism that continued even into her 90s, Phyllis Schlafly never wavered in giving a voice to millions of Americans concerned about preserving constitutional rights, strong families, and American greatness. Her influence will continue to be felt for years to come, and as we celebrate an iconic figure in the conservative cause, our thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends, and many admirers.”
Schlafly was born Aug. 15, 1924, and grew up in Depression-era St. Louis. Her parents were Republican but not politically involved.
With the country involved in World War II during her college years, Schlafly worked the graveyard shift at the St. Louis Ordnance Plant. Her job included testing ammunition by firing machine guns. She would get off work at 8 a.m., attend morning classes, then sleep in the middle of the day before doing it all over again.
The schedule limited her options for a major. "In order to pick classes to fit my schedule I picked political science," Schlafly recalled in a 2007 AP interview.
She graduated from Washington University in 1944, when she was 19. Her first taste of real politics came at age 22, when she guided the 1946 campaign of Republican congressional candidate Claude Bakewell, helping him to a major upset win.
In 1952, with her young family living in nearby Alton, Illinois, Schlafly's husband, attorney John Schlafly Jr., was approached about running for Congress. He declined, but she ran and narrowly lost in a predominantly Democratic district. She also ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1970.
Schlafly earned a master's degree in government from Harvard in 1945. She enrolled in Washington University School of Law in 1976, and at age 51, graduated 27th in a class of 204.
Schlafly received an honorary degree at Washington University's commencement in 2008. Though some students and faculty silently protested by getting up from their seats and turning their backs to the stage, Schlafly called it "a happy day. I'm just sorry for those who tried to rain on a happy day."
She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
Fox News' Chris Snyder, Joe Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
As early as January 1964 NASA administrator, James E. Webb, had been asked by President Lyndon B. Johnson for a well-developed proposal of future space objectives after the Apollo Moon landings. Webb did not want to respond; instead he tried unsuccessfully to obtain another commitment from the President for a major space effort after the Moon landing. The consequence was that there were virtually no “new starts” for NASA during this period, and certainly nothing on the order of a new piloted launch system. This was reflected in the NASA budgets of the era.
Even though the NASA Administrator declined to define a serious plan for NASA's future, the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) proved willing to do it for him. PSAC issued a report in February 1967. The Space Program in the Post-Apollo Period did not endorse anything as specific as continued exploration of the Moon, and certainly not a rush to build a Moon base. Rather it proposed an organizing theme: “a program directed ultimately at the exploration of the planets by man.” Without a commitment to continued aggressive efforts in space, when he left the space agency in October 1968 Webb was embittered by what he saw as a retreat from the aggressive space program of Apollo.
When Richard Nixon took office, he appointed a Space Task Group to study post-Apollo plans and make recommendations. Chartered on February 13, 1969, under the chairmanship of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew this group met throughout the spring and summer to plot a course for the post-Apollo space program. The politics of this effort was intense. NASA lobbied hard with the Group and especially its chair for a far-reaching post-Apollo space program that included development of a space station, a reusable Space Shuttle, a Moon base, and a human expedition to Mars.
The NASA position was well reflected in the group's report on September 15, 1969, but Nixon did not act on the Group's recommendations. Instead, he was silent on the future of the U.S. space program for more than a year after he took office. Finally, Nixon issued a March 7, 1970, statement that clearly announced his approach toward dealing with NASA and space exploration, “we must also recognize that many critical problems here on this planet make high priority demands on our attention and our resources.”
Post-Apollo planning demonstrates a negative impact of the Moon landings—an object lesson on how not to develop and sustain a long-term strategic program of human space exploration. It seems that in part because of the pressures to achieve Apollo on the schedule mandated by JFK, the technical solutions were not sustainable. At some level the program may not have been sustainable because it was so exceptional.
The central question for NASA at the successful completion of Project Apollo was how best to continue its overall space exploration mission. This was a consideration especially important at the time because of the environment in Washington. In 1969 the newly installed administration of Richard M. Nixon was already consumed with other crises: urban unrest, race riots, the Vietnam conflict and the anti-war movement, political radicalism of the left and the right, economic recession, welfare problems, and runaway budgets.
Most importantly, Nixon had to deal with a complex debate over the consensus of a vision of America as it had been articulated for more than a generation. This sustained criticism of national character and meaning plunged the U.S. into fundamental changes, political turmoil and activism of all stripes, and a counter-culture that rejected middle-class perceptions and social construction during the 1960s.
The result was a decision to retrench. NASA's aggressive desires to undertake a space shuttle, a space station, a lunar base, and a mission to Mars never had much chance of success. The Space Shuttle did emerge from that process, but not in the manner in which NASA engineers believed would be the case. The United States is now nearly half a century since those events and still do not have a clear direction for the human exploration of space. Where might efforts go in the future?
Bruce Arena doesn't see much value in the Confederations Cup.
Former U.S. national team head coach Bruce Arena has called the Confederations Cup "somewhat useless" ahead of the United States' CONCACAF playoff match against Mexico on Saturday in Pasadena.
The winner of Saturday's game will travel to Russia to take part in next summer's Confederations Cup, which is regarded as a dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup host nation.
While he believes the logistics aspect of the tournament has importance, Arena says the event, as a competition, doesn't have much merit.
"For the most part, the competition part of it is somewhat useless," Arena said after LA Galaxy's training session Thursday.
"I guess the part about being in [the next World Cup host's] country and getting the lay of the land is important, but the Confederations Cup is one of these competitions where I'm sure the national teams and the players would rather not have it, because it's just another game or series of games at a time when players need a break.
"So the competition part of it is really insignificant. I guess the logistics part has some value."
With the new format, every Gold Cup winner can qualify for the Confederations Cup through the CONCACAF Cup. For Arena, it's a good change, as long as big-name teams participate.
"It's an interesting concept," Arena said of the CONCACAF Cup. "It's a money-maker. It's footing the bill of a confederation that, somehow, their books have not added up right over the years, and they're probably trying to get a little bit in reserve.
"I think it's a great concept, though, but if this happened between El Salvador and Mexico -- no disrespect to El Salvador -- I'm not sure it would bring [the kind of crowds and money that US-Mexico will]."

Monsanto's ongoing humiliation proceeds apace. No, I'm not referring to the company's triumph in our recent “Villains of Food” poll. Instead, I'm talking about a Tuesday item from the Des Moines Register‘s Philip Brasher, reporting that Monsanto has been forced into the unenviable position of having to pay farmers to spray the herbicides of rival companies.
If you tend large plantings of Monsanto's “Roundup Ready” soy or cotton, genetically engineered to withstand application of the company's Roundup herbicide (which will kill the weeds — supposedly — but not the crops), Monsanto will cut you a $6 check for every acre on which you apply at least two other herbicides. One imagines farmers counting their cash as literally millions of acres across the South and Midwest get doused with Monsanto-subsidized poison cocktails.
The move is the latest step in the abject reversal of Monsanto's longtime claim: that Roundup Ready technology solved the age-old problem of weeds in an ecologically benign way. The company had developed a novel trait that would allow crops to survive unlimited lashings of glyphosate, Monsanto's then-patent-protected, broad-spectrum herbicide. It was kind of a miracle technology. Farmers would no longer have to think about weeds; glyphosate, which killed everything but the trait-endowed crop, would do all the work. Moreover, Monsanto promised, Roundup was less toxic to humans and wildlife than the herbicides then in use; and it allowed farmers to decrease erosion by dramatically reducing tillage — a common method of weed control.
There was just one problem, which the Union of Concerned Scientists pointed out as early as 1993, New York University nutritionist and food-politics author Marion Nestle recently reminded us. When farmers douse the same field year after year with the same herbicide, certain weeds will develop resistance. When they do, it will take ever-larger doses of that herbicide to kill them — making the survivors even hardier. Eventually, it will be time to bring in in the older, harsher herbicides to do the trick, UCS predicted.
At the time and for years after, Monsanto dismissed the concerns as “hypothetical,” Nestle reports. Today, Roundup Ready seeds have conquered prime U.S. farmland from the deep South to the northern prairies — 90 percent of soybean acres and 70 percent of corn and cotton acres are planted in Roundup Ready seeds. Monsanto successfully conquered a fourth crop, sugar beets, gaining a stunning 95 percent market share after the USDA approved Roundup Ready beet seeds in 2008. But recently, as I reported here, a federal judge halted future plantings of Roundup Ready beets until the USDA completes an environmental impact study of their effects.
Given what happened to other Roundup Ready crops, it's hard to imagine that the USDA can come up with an environmental impact study that will exonerate Monsanto's sugar beet seeds. Today, there are no fewer than 10 weed species resistant to Roundup, thriving “in at least 22 states infesting millions of acres,” The New York Times recently reported. And the ways farmers are responding to them are hardly ecologically sound: jacked-up application rates of Roundup, supplemented by other, harsher poisons.
And as Monsanto's once-celebrated Roundup Ready traits come under fire, there's another Roundup problem no one's talking about: Roundup itself, once hailed as a ecologically benign herbicide, is looking increasingly problematic. A study by France's University of Caen last year found that the herbicide's allegedly “inert” ingredients magnify glyphosate's toxic effects. According to the study, “the proprietary mixtures available on the market could cause cell damage and even death” at levels commonly used on farm fields.
Moreover, the annual cascade of Roundup on vast swaths of prime farmland also appears to be undermining soil health and productivity, as this startling recent report shows.
Meanwhile, the endlessly repeated claim that Roundup Ready technology saves “millions of tons” of soil from erosion, by allowing farmers to avoid tilling to kill weeds, appears to be wildly trumped up. According to Environmental Working Group's reading of the USDA's 2007 National Resource Inventory, “there has been no progress in reducing soil erosion in the Corn Belt since 1997.” (The Corn Belt is the section of the Midwest where the great bulk of Roundup Ready corn and soy are planted.) “The NRI shows that an average-sized Iowa farm loses five tons of high quality topsoil per acre each year,” EWG writes.
In short, Monsanto's Roundup Ready technology is emerging as an environmental disaster. The question isn't why a judge demanded an environmental impact study of Roundup Ready sugar beets in 2010; it's that no one did so in 1996 before the technology was rolled out. After all, the Union of Concerned Scientists was already quite, well, concerned back then.
As I wrote in June, rather than spark a reassessment of the wisdom of relying on toxic chemicals, the failure of Roundup Ready has the U.S. agricultural establishment scrambling to intensify chemical use. Companies like Dow Agriscience are dusting off old, highly toxic poisons like 2, 4-D and promoting them as the “answer” to Roundup's problems.
In a better world, farmers would be looking to non-chemical methods for controlling weeds: crop rotations, mulching, cover crops, etc. Instead, they're being paid by Monsanto to ramp up application of poisons. Perhaps the USDA's main research arm, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, will rise to the occasion by funding research in non-chemical weed-control methods? Not likely, since the Obama administration tapped a staunch Monsanto man to lead that crucial agency.
But instead of true innovation, we have the spectacle of Monsanto paying farmers to dump vast chemical cocktails onto land that not only feeds us, but also drains into our streams and rivers.

Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey said the figures showed that its clubs "continue to offer value for money"
The average cost of Football League tickets across its three divisions over the 2014-15 season was £14.08, the organisation has announced.
In the Championship the average cost was £15.65, in League One it was £11.72 and in League Two £11.58.
This weekend, fans across England are to protest about high ticket prices.
In 2014, the BBC's Price of Football study found ticket prices had risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011.
It also found that the average cost of the cheapest match-day ticket had increased by 31.7% in League One and 19% in League Two, while in the Championship the average price had fallen 3.2%.
This year's Price of Football study will be published on 15 October.
The Football League's chief executive Shaun Harvey said the average prices, which the Football League has calculated for the first time, showed that its clubs "continue to offer value for money".
The figures were calculated using adult and concessionary prices for season ticket holders, non-season ticket holders, corporate hospitality and away fans.
This weekend, fans from 10 Championship clubs and all 20 Premier League teams intend to protest as part of a campaign organised by the Football Supporters' Federation called 'Twenty's Plenty', which calls for a £20 cap on away ticket prices.
V.L. Cox and Jody Hardin at St. Joseph's
Farmer Jody Hardin, founder of Argenta Market and who was instrumental in getting the certified farmer's market in operation in Argenta, is working with the St. Joseph Center of Arkansas on a plan to create an organic farm and farming school in the old St. Joseph's Orphanage on Camp Robinson Road.
The St. Joseph Center non-profit was created after the Catholic Diocese of Arkansas announced in 2008 it would sell the 70-acre property and the four-story, 80,000-square-foot Charles Thompson-designed orphanage unless someone could come up with a viable business plan. The board of directors of the non-profit had until Sept. 1 to come up with a plan for the property. Hardin's recent appeal must have seemed heaven-sent. His idea, board chair Sandra DeCoursey said, was well matched to the Center's board's desires: to create something “sustainable” and to be “serving God and community.”
The St. Joseph's farm/school would be developed along the model of the Intervale Center in Vermont, with the farm incubator, a bakery, a “food hub” where area farmers could converge to sell their product and a school offering a variety of courses, such as how to farm organically, grow certain foods, getting food to market and so forth.
The Arkansas Historic Preservation Alliance named the 1910 brick and stone orphanage to its Most Endangered Places List this year. Hardin, in consultation with architects Polk Stanley Wilcox, believes restoration of St. Joseph's building for classroom space (and to house other non-profits) will cost $5 million to $7 million. The budget for the farm operation should be about $125,000 a year, he estimates. Hardin's farm operation would be for-profit, and the educational component non-profit. The board would have to grant him a sublease to operate.
V.L. Cox, an artist with a background in both advertising and farming who is working with Hardin, said the idea would take St. Joseph's back “to the way it was 100 years ago,” when the Benedictine Sisters farmed the land to provide for the children. There is a dairy on the property, and cattle roam St. Joseph's pastures — within the city limits of North Little Rock. The kitchen, still in use for the groups who now come to St. Joseph's on retreat, is spacious, as is a basement where the nuns once canned food, Cox said. Hardin does not plan to get into ranching. He may, however, use the cow pies in a demonstration in how to fertilize fields and hopes that a proposed zoning change goes through in North Little Rock that will allow him to raise goats and sell goat cheese. There is also pecan orchard on the property.
One of the first projects at St. Joseph's, Hardin said, will be a demonstration by the Kerr Center for Sustainable Agriculture in Oklahoma on how to eradicate Bermuda grass organically by growing annual sorghum. But first, Hardin and Cox hope to grow a crop of vigorous grants and foundation gifts. A Kickstarter crowd-funding page will go online Friday, and Hardin and Cox will hold a press conference Tuesday to go into more detail on the plans for St. Joseph's.
We wanted to upgrade our CustoMac (aka Hackintosh) from 802.11n to 802.11ac. We hoped to achieve 700 mbps wi-fi compared to our 200 mbps on 802.11n.
This wi-fi card works with OS X 10.10 Yosemite's native drivers; not sure about 10.9 or earlier, nor if Windows or Linux can work.
This kit's PCIe adapter is of the highest quality & easily fit an available 1x slot in our tower, with proper alignment for the card's screw fastener. Many such adapters are misaligned and thus the outer antenna face needs to be bent (by hand) to allow the card to be tightened in place, but not this one.
Also slot connector pins were perfectly sized assuring proper electronic contact.
The included USB power cable (for Bluetooth 4.0) fit snugly on the adapter, and the other end mated perfectly with a USB plug on the system board.
The four antennas included are sturdy with flexible joint design for various angles of aiming.
Although the kit shipped with an extra Bluetooth antenna to be connected to the card and then taped inside the PC's tower, we first tried using the other option which was to connect Bluetooth to one of the four external antennas. So far this has resulted in BT signal of adequate strength, so we haven't yet used the internal BT antenna.
Now for the main component: the Broadcom BCM94360CD wi-fi & Bluetooth card is a genuine Apple part, not a defective second or counterfeit. The authenticity was shown by using the downloadable Macintosh utility "DPCIManager." Run this app and choose "PCI List," then look for Broadcom Corp 802.11ac line. If the "Device" entry is "43A0" then the card is genuine. If the Device shows as "4360" then it is a defective second or counterfeit. Many of which run only at 802.11n speeds, and are limited to Bluetooth v.3. (apparently the counterfeiters chose a fake Device # that equated partially to the BCM 4360 model number, but that is still bogus!)
But no bogusness here: this card is the real deal, the BCM94360CD model identical to what is currently shipping in MacBook Pro's and iMacs. (You can also run DPCIManager on your MacBook Pro or iMac to see the 43A0 on your genuine wi-fi card.)
This kit's wi-fi performance exceeded our expectations: the card consistently connects to our W-LAN at 1100 -1300 mbps (see screen attached). This means that our CustoMac now has faster LAN throughput to our other home systems via 802.11ac wi-fi than it does via its cabled 1 gbps ethernet.
This CustoMac is used a home file and backup server, and having 30% greater throughput to it on the network reduces data bottlenecks.
We've used the kit for several weeks now, and continue to be impressed with the high quality.
Village People Lead Singer Won't Sing Y.M.C.A at Olympics Protest
Victor Willis, lead singer of the Village People, will not perform Y.M.C.A. to protest Russia's anti gay laws.
Activists suggested playing the song at Sochi Olympics as a form of protest, while the Americans were introduced in the opening ceremonies.
Activists want to respond to Russia's anti gay laws by playing the gay anthem, Y.M.C.A., as America's athletes are introduced during the opening ceremonies at the Sochi Olympics.
Victor Willis, lead singer of the Village People, states that he won't perform the song as a protest. As well, that the song isn't even meant to be a gay anthem,
“The words were crafted by me to be taken any number of ways but not specific to gays. It's much broader than that. The song is universal. I don't mind that gays think the song is about them but I won't perform the song in support of any protest.”

Here's what I found on the label of Quaker Oats Peaches and Cream instant oatmeal, the kind that comes in little packets and heats up in the microwave in the time it takes to retrieve a spoon to go with it:
–partially hydrogenated soybean oil
–artificial color
–artificial flavor
–corn syrup solids
They do this. To poor, humble, wholesome oatmeal. The label boasts well over 20 ingredients.
Even the more natural brands tend to be higher than need to be in sugar and use instant oats rather than the rolled oats (rolled have a lower glycemic index and are slower to digest…both pluses).
So I set to crafting a “Make Your Own” Microwave Oatmeal…one the kids can do on busy weekday mornings with as much ease as opening a little packet. Compared to the boxed version, this one tastes better and is cheaper and greener and may help with kids' math skills and solve world peace.
How to Make Microwave Oatmeal
Start with just a few ingredients, not a few dozen: Rolled oats, nuts, dried fruit, and brown sugar. Add a little cinnamon or other spices if you like.
Put everything into a big jar with enough room that you can shake it all up. When you're ready to make a bowl of oatmeal, just scoop it from the container, add twice as much water as oats, and pop into the microwave.
Once it's cooked, give it a stir and add a splash of milk if you like. Feel free to add in any extras, such as fresh berries, sliced bananas, or diced pears. A drizzle of honey or maple syrup work is a fine addition as well.
Breakfast is done. And it's a much nicer way to treat your oats.

Print Make Your Own Microwave Oatmeal This recipe makes a lightly sweetened oats mixture that's ready to be scooped up and microwaved into single-serving bowls of nourishing oatmeal. Be sure to use a deep cereal bowl for cooking the oats since they can bubble up and overflow. Prep Time 5 minutes Cook Time 2 minutes Total Time 7 minutes Servings 8 Calories 165 kcal Author katiemorford Ingredients 2 cups rolled/old-fashioned oats (not quick oats or instant oats)
½ cup dried fruit (raisins; dried cranberries, blueberries or cherries; or diced dried apples, apricots or peaches)
½ cup sliced, slivered, or chopped nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts)
¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon Instructions Put the oats, dried fruit, nuts, brown sugar, and cinnamon into a large jar, storage container, or ziplock bag. Shake well until all of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed together. To cook a bowl of oatmeal, first give your jar a hearty shake to mix any ingredients that have settled to the bottom of the container. Pour a rounded 1/3 cup of the oatmeal mixture into a deep cereal bowl. If the bowl is too shallow, the oatmeal may overflow in the microwave. Pour 2/3 cup of water into the bowl and stir well. Microwave on high until the water is absorbed and the oats are tender, about 2 minutes. Remove from the microwave and stir. The oatmeal will thicken as it cools. Add fresh fruit, more nuts, and milk if desired.

As I listened in to Boston College's Center for Work & Family's virtual “Fathers in the Workplace Forum” on Tuesday afternoon, I was immediately struck by two things:
One, an outpouring of more than 350 fathers had signed up for the lunch-time forum to hear about the center's research on what father's really want and whether they can “have it all.”
And two, how absolutely, unequivocally critical those first few weeks and months after a child is born are for setting patterns of behavior that will shape the future for both the mother and the father, as well as the child.
Even the most egalitarian-minded men and women, surveys and time studies have found, slide unconsciously, helplessly almost, into traditional gender roles once the baby arrives. Before long, the couples who promised to be equal partners find the mothers scaling back or reducing hours at work or dropping out of the workforce and fathers working as much as or more than ever to make up the earnings. But unlike in past generations, dads are feeling more stressed because they're also doing more at home.
But is that what fathers really want?
Not according to the center's fascinating series of studies in recent years involving nearly 1,000 fathers, most of them white-collar professionals with big jobs at Fortune 500 companies.
Yes, they want to do good work and they are ambitious: Nearly 80 percent told BC researchers that they wanted to advance to positions with greater responsibilities.
But that's not all they want.
When asked why they valued their jobs, the ability to advance and earn more money came in fifth and sixth on their list. Job security – perhaps an artifact of asking the question on the heels of the Great Recession — came in No. 1, following by a sense of accomplishment, the fact that work is interesting and, most notably, they valued flexible work arrangements.
When asked to rank what equates with being a good father, these men put being physically and emotionally present for their children at the top of the list, and their role as a breadwinner number four out of six choices.
In fact, 77 percent of the fathers said, as other surveys have found, that they wished they had more time to spend with their kids.
As center director Brad Harrington explained to me in a recent interview, this is all part of a slow evolution leading to fairly massive social change. A generation ago, men were forced to step in at home when women began to work in the marketplace. Now, he said, more men are reaping “significant emotional rewards” from that more intimate family involvement.
Fully 86 percent said that being a good father is their number one priority. And more than half in one survey said that if money wasn't an issue, they'd be willing to quit work to take care of children. (Harrington said that, by the U.S. Census Bureau's strict definition, a scant 4 percent of fathers in married couples are stay-at-home dads. But other surveys, using more generous measures, have found that fathers are the primary caregivers for as many as 20 percent of all children under age five.)
“As men put their foot in the water and get more immersed with their kids, they start to realize what they've been missing,” he said.
In an admittedly unscientific quick poll during Tuesday's virtual forum, fully 70 percent of the fathers online said they'd consider being an at-home parent.
“That shows a huge attitudinal shift about the legitimacy of at-home fathers,” Harrington said. “We didn't expect the numbers to be that big.”
So that's what fathers want. What have they got?
Work. When men become fathers, managers expect the same amount of work from them, Harrington's research has found. And social science has shown that men tend to get a “fatherhood bonus,” because employers think they'll be even more committed and hardworking now they have a family to provide for. At the same time, mothers who return to work are in a “Catch-22,” Harrington said, with research showing that employers begin to think they're less committed, less promotable and even less competent.
Fathers described their ideal: About two-thirds of the fathers surveyed said that the best arrangement would be to share equally in work, household chores and caring for children. Then confessed their reality: that same two-thirds said that their spouses did more work at home and with the children than they did.
“This is the source of the conflict and dissonance that men feel,” Harrington said during the virtual forum. “They feel they should be doing more, but they're not living up to those aspirations.”
And that's where workplace cultures and those first few days and weeks after the baby is born come in.
The Center found that professional women, on average, take between two and six months off after a child is born. But in their surveys, 96 percent of the men took less than two weeks off. And 16 percent took no time off at all.
So guess who is becoming used to the baby and his or her needs? Which parent has the time to learn that this kind of cry means the baby is hungry, and that kind of fussiness means its naptime? Mom.
Dad comes home from work, tired but eager to help, but often doesn't quite know what to do. That's why so many time-use research finds that fathers tend to be the “helper parent” and that their child care is typically done in the presence of the mother – which doesn't give mothers much of a break nor does it build a father's sense of confidence and competence.
“From the moment the train leaves the tracks, the mother is the primary caregiver and the father is the supporting actor,” Harrington said. “And nothing subsequent seems to change that trajectory once it gets started.”
I was struck by how different those trajectories are in countries where fathers are encouraged to take parental leave by government policy, workplace culture and even social pressure. Research done by father researchers I spoke to in Sweden and in Denmark have found that ensuring that fathers have solo parental leave, typically after a mother has finished her leave and the baby is six months or more, is the surest way to ensure a more egalitarian division of labor between parents at both work and home.
Denmark is on its way to full parity in the amount of time men and women spend at work and at home within the next few decades. If present trends continue, the United States, where mothers still put in twice the hours doing housework and child care, is 80 to 100 years at least away from that, time use researchers have found.
I spoke with Andreas Ottemo, a young father in Sweden who decided with his spouse from the start that they would equally share parental leave and work and home duties. He had just stayed home with his young daughter, Esther, who'd been sick. When Esther was born, his wife stayed home with her on paid maternal leave for nine months. Then Ottemo took over and stayed home on paid paternal leave for another nine months.
“I know it's a cliché, but in some ways, quality time is quantity time,” he told me. “And if you don't get good patterns set, and take responsibility from the start, it's hard to do later on.”
It wasn't easy – there were days when the former engineer felt flattened by another set of dishes to do or more laundry to wash rather than his neat check lists of “productive” accomplishments at work. “But I began to think of it as natural,” he said. “I really began to feel, ‘This is my kid, too.'”
For Ottemo, he had friends and colleagues who were active fathers and also taking parental leave. There was a lot of free discussion at work and among friends about the role of fathers and the importance of flexible work for family time.
And that, Brad Harrington said, is part of what motivated him to hold the virtual forum. In the United States, there are few places for fathers to talk openly about work and life issues – both about the conflicts between them, but also about how enriching full participation in both can be.
To that end, Harrington introduced the fathers of Deloitte Dads of Canada, a network of fathers who want to both, explained founder Andrew Hamer, “maintain an accelerated career trajectory, but also have an active co-parent role.”
The group offers education, advocacy, informal sessions for junior and senior dads to share stories about what's working and what isn't at the firm and opportunities for family fun. It also is active in charity. And the demand has grown so rapidly that they're considering expanding beyond their Toronto offices and going nationwide in Canada. They are also talking to their counterparts in the UK, Australia and, yes, even the United States, where a vacuum in government leadership has left setting workplace culture and policy to individual firms and individual managers, whose attitudes and behaviors are all over the map.
“Women have been good having a voice in the feminist movement, saying ‘We have a place in the home, now we need a place in the workplace that is equal to men,'” Harrington said. “Men have been a lot less vocal and a lot less assertive to say, ‘We've got a place in the workplace, but we need to legitimize our place in the home.'”

DANVILLE -- Another school district in our area has ordered the head football coach to stop praying with his players.
Members of the Danville Area High School football team have a tradition of praying before each game. A national group fighting for the separation of church and state found out about that, and like it did at another school in our area this season, helped put an end to it.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter to Danville Area's superintendent this week after someone posted a video on social media of a coach appearing to pray with the football team.
This is the same group that stopped Dunmore High School's coach from praying with his team this fall.
"Prayer can occur in a public school if it is student-driven and that our coaches are not to participate in any way," said Danville Superintendent Cheryl Latorre.
Earlier in the football season, Latorre was contacted by a parent who saw a post on social media where the team was singing a hymn. The parent was concerned that a coach was praying with them.
"At one point, one coach did kneel down and that is what caused it. It was a social media piece, a Facebook piece, that was sent out to this Freedom From Religion Foundation," Latorre explained.
Latorre was contacted by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a group that works to ensure the separation of church and state. The group asked the school district to provide it with assurances that coaches are not leading students in prayer.
"We've instituted the case law. We've made sure this isn't happening," said Latorre.
The Danville Area School District updated its coaches handbook to include this information so the coaches of all of the sports teams are aware.
Jim Packer coached his son's hockey team but not for a public school.
"They should be able to do what they want to do, whether they're a coach or the athlete themselves," said Packer. "The kids were allowed to do pretty much what they wanted. And we always got together, maybe not so much in a religious way, but we always got together and prayed for the best."
Within hours of the Obama administration's interim nuclear deal with Iran, Bill Kristol was already invoking Munich. Benjamin Netanyahu's minions have been doing so for months.
Ostensibly, that's because the agreement doesn't dismantle Iran's nuclear program but stalls it in return for partial sanctions relief. That's true. But Kristol and Netanyahu have no remotely plausible alternative for fully dismantling Iran's nuclear program, either. In place of the interim agreement, they want more sanctions, which Iran's reformist government has said would doom any agreement. Or they want war, which former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who oversaw Israel's Iran file from 2002 to 2010, has said would rally Iranians behind their regime, splinter the international coalition against Tehran, and thus ultimately increase Iran's chances of getting a bomb.
If Netanyahu and company have no better strategy for preventing an Iranian nuke, why call Obama's deal a Munich-style surrender? Because that's their name for any diplomatic agreement that requires Western compromise. For Netanyahu and his American allies, it's always 1938, because if it's not 1938 and your opponents aren't Neville Chamberlain, then you're not Winston Churchill. And if you're not Churchill, you've got no compelling rationale for wielding power.
Over the past quarter-century, there's hardly an American or Israeli leader the Kristol-Netanyahu crowd hasn't compared to Chamberlain. In 1985, Newt Gingrich called Reagan's first meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev “the most dangerous summit for the West since Adolf Hitler met with Neville Chamberlain in 1938 in Munich.” When Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, hawks took out newspaper ads declaring that “Appeasement is as unwise in 1988 as in 1938.”
Then, when Israel moved to thaw its own cold war with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Yitzhak Rabin assumed the Chamberlain role. “Earlier in this century, Neville Chamberlain thought he could buy ‘peace in our time' by handing over the mountain defenses of Czechoslovakia to Hitler, who promised to accept a deal of ‘land for peace,” wrote Netanyahu in The New York Times in 1993. “The Rabin government is now betting the security of Israel on Yasser Arafat's promises.”
Then it was Bill Clinton. “The word that best describes Clinton administration [foreign] policy is appeasement,” explained Robert Kagan and Kristol in 1999. Then, of course, it was the opponents of war with Iraq. “The establishment fights most bitterly and dishonestly when it feels cornered and thinks it's about to lose. Churchill was attacked more viciously in 1938 and 1939 than earlier in the decade,” wrote Kristol in a 2002 editorial, “The Axis of Appeasement.”
But since the deaths of Saddam Hussein and Yasser Arafat, Iran's leaders have become the Hitlers du jour. Netanyahu alone has wielded the analogy so many times I've lost count.
Iran's leaders, to be sure, are a gruesome lot, guilty of terrible crimes against their people and of supporting some of the most odious dictators and terrorists in the Middle East. But the Nazi analogy is laughable. Hitler used Europe's most advanced economy to build its most advanced military and for a time, conquer almost the entire continent. Iran, a middling economic power at best, couldn't even defeat Iraq. Even if Tehran acquired a nuclear weapon, which I dearly hope does not happen, Iran would still be surrounded by a host of stronger countries, including Turkey (a NATO member), Pakistan (a Sunni country with a host of nukes), India (a nuclear-armed semi-superpower), and Israel (which reportedly has 200 nuclear weapons and a uniquely close relationship with the United States).
If Iran lacks the industrial and military might for regional dominance, it also lacks the ideological power. For a time in the 1930s, leading Western intellectuals believed fascist regimes could economically outperform democracies. No one believes that about Iran. Indeed, whatever regional prestige Tehran once enjoyed has been destroyed by its support for Bashar al-Assad.
Iran is a corrupt, nasty regime seeking to stay in power, deter attack, and extend its regional influence to the extent possible. It's not suicidal. That's Dagan's view, and it's the view of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey. It was once Israel's view, too, since Israel sold Iran arms in the 1980s even though Tehran's regime was more addicted to revolutionary Islamic rhetoric back then than it is now.
Israel did so because, at the time, it was more afraid of Iraq. But then Iraq's patron, the Soviet Union, collapsed and a decade of Western sanctions hobbled Saddam. As Iranian power filled the void, Israel's relationship with Tehran shifted from transactional to fearful. And after George W. Bush toppled Saddam, thus further increasing Iranian influence, American hawks jumped on the “Iran as Nazi Germany” analogy, too.
Now both groups are addicted to it. For Bibi, focusing on the Iran threat unites his hawkish base. Focusing on peace with the Palestinians, by contrast, leaves him caught between the world's demand that Israel withdraw from the West Bank and his base's insistence that Israel remain there. It was his 1998 Wye River agreement with Arafat, after all, that split Netanyahu's government and ended his first prime ministership. No wonder that when Netanyahu returned to office in 2009, he reportedly told Obama in their first meeting that they should defer the peace process until they had dealt with Iran.
For Netanyahu's American allies, Iran fulfills a similar function. For decades now, hawks like Kristol and groups like AIPAC have stoked American Jewish fears of a second Holocaust. But since the mild-mannered Mahmoud Abbas succeeded Arafat and the terrifying second intifada gave way to productive Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation in the West Bank, Jewish hawks have found it harder to slot Palestinians into the Nazi role. Yes, Hamas still understandably frightens many American Jews. But if the Palestinian issue is a political headache for Netanyahu, it has become a headache for groups like AIPAC, too, which are in the awkward position of publicly supporting a Palestinian state and yet also publicly supporting everything the Israeli government does, even when its actions clearly undermine the possibility of a Palestinian state. Iran, by contrast, unifies the American Jewish establishment, which dislikes grappling with the dilemmas of Jewish power and feels most comfortable depicting Jews as permanently menaced by potentially genocidal anti-Semitic threats.
“Netanyahu doesn't know history,” declared the great Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer earlier this year. Nor does he know much about Iran, a country whose residents he thought were banned from wearing jeans. What he and his American allies do know is how to exploit historical analogies for political and ideological gain. Obama's interim nuclear deal threatens their ability to do that, which is part of the reason it's such a welcome thing.
Six months ago, when my grandfather died, he left me his trusty shovel, Natasha. He'd claimed to have used it to dig the trenches in World War II, but he was only seventy-three when he died, and the shovel has “1995” engraved on it. Nevertheless, the shovel is something important to me, and when I got it, I swore that one day I would dig a giant hole, somewhere far from the beach where I could go as deep as I want. I'd get all of my friends to come out and help. We'd dig until our souls were satisfied and have a story to tell for the rest of our lives.
Today is the day. At 1PM, my friends and I will meet in the woods behind my house and dig a hole to be spoken of in legend.
Still no real progress between #Titans and CB Alterraun Verner. Scheduled to hit FA on March 11 — Jim Wyatt (@jwyattsports) February 27, 2014
Sep 22, 2013; Nashville, TN, USA; Tennessee Titans cornerback Jason McCourty (30) and cornerback Alterraun Verner (20) celebrate after Verner (20) made the game winning tackle against the San Diego Chargers during the second half at LP Field.

Tennessee Titans cornerback Alterraun Verner has insisted that he'd like to test the free-agent market and gauge his value. The 25-year-old Pro Bowl cornerback hasn't dismissed the possibility of returning. Verner teamed with Jason McCourty to form one of the NFL's best outside cornerback tandems. It's fair to consider Verner among the NFL's elite No. 2 cornerbacks, maybe even the best No. 2 cornerback.
Two weeks remain before free agency. The Titans insist they're not using the franchise tag. Neither party appears close to an agreement. The significantly increased cap space means this team has more money to re-sign him. At the same time, it allows other teams to overpay for him, much like the St. Louis Rams did when they lured Cortland Finnegan away during the 2012 offseason.
Verner adds value to this organization, both on and off the field. In 2012, the Titans re-signed McCourty to a six-year contract. Re-signing Verner to a minimum four-year contract would mean that the Titans would have their premiere cornerback duo under contract through 2017.
Are they willing to pay for that luxury? Verner could demand somewhere around $8-10 million per season. It's a huge change-up from when this team was trying to demote Verner for their project, Tommie Campbell. Verner responded with a strong preseason, won the starting job, and clinched his first Pro Bowl berth.
There's no disputing that Verner is one of the top three players on this defense. Losing him wouldn't doom defensive coordinator Ray Horton‘s first attempt at installing his 3-4 hybrid schemes. The Titans could find a cheaper replacement and have enough leftover money to reinvest toward more important extensions (e.g. Bernard Pollard) and/or free-agent help at offensive tackle or linebacker.
Some foresight has already been taken toward this situation. The Titans have drafted cornerback projects in each of the last three drafts who could give this team the flexibility to promote and move on. Last year's third-round pick Blidi Wreh-Wilson, nickelback Coty Sensabaugh, and Campbell are all young cornerbacks who'll try to earn promotions up the depth chart. Sensabaugh has played well and Wreh-Wilson is an unproven talent that the organization has high hopes for. Campbell hasn't capitalized on any of his three opportunities so it's hard to expect much out of him.
What if the Titans aren't satisfied with any of these players replacing Verner? General manager Ruston Webster could use the No. 11 pick toward one of the top two cornerbacks: Darqueze Dennard and Justin Gilbert. Both players are considered as top 10 candidates. Dennard is more of a press coverage cornerback whereas Gilbert is more like Verner in that he has more playmaking potential. He's faster and will make more interceptions.
Not satisfied? Cornerbacks are expected to run deep throughout the free-agent market. Aqib Talib is another Pro Bowl-caliber cornerback who'll look for a big payday. Injuries are the one thing that have kept him from earning status as a reliable shutdown cornerback. Talib showcased his talents when he essentially blanketed Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. Then Talib got injured and the New England Patriots defense fell apart. His absence made a significant difference.
More affordable, yet still reliable options: Vontae Davis, Brent Grimes, Dominqiue Rodgers-Cromartie, Sam Shields, Captain Munnerlyn, Tarrell Brown, Walter Thurmond, and Corey Graham. Then there are a few grizzled veterans including Asante Samuel and Charles Tillman.
So many options could work in Tennessee's favor toward keeping Verner. A higher supply means that teams won't have to overpay for one individual asset. It's not like the last couple of seasons where cornerbacks received huge contracts because it was such a shallow market.
It's all about prioritizing. Horton coached a top-10 defense in Cleveland. His only star cornerback was Joe Haden. Not having two-star cornerbacks…that won't cripple him. It's a luxury but not a necessity. What's more important is that they make sure they're finding players who can generate a greater pass rush, play better run defense, and improve their coverages against tight ends.

the forgotten warp drive
Mathematician with an interest in general relativity, Burkhard Heim, had an idea for a war drive powered not by nuclear fusion or the decay of exotic matter, but by magnets.
You've probably never heard of Burkhard Heim. Not many people have. After all, he was rather reclusive, all of his work was published in German and his brief moment in the spotlight was in 1957 when he proposed an odd propulsion system that could easily achieve relativistic speeds. A spacecraft powered by this hyperdrive would get us from Earth to Mars in just a few hours and make exploring our immediate stellar neighborhood possible within our lifetimes. Sounds too good to be true? Well, to some extent, it is. The theories behind how this system would work are only half complete and their primary support is complex mathematics.
Originally, Heim was trying to reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity and created a universe with six dimensions in the formulas he used. In those six dimensions, electromagnetism and gravity are linked, so if you change the strength of an electromagnetic field, you affect gravity. So far, we've observed that gravity has an influence on magnetic fields but we haven't seen how electromagnetic fields can manipulate the gravity of an object. But that's exactly what a Heim hyperdrive does. It uses intense magnetic fields powered by equally impressive currents to produce a force equivalent to dark energy, a vital ingredient for warp drive technology.
How much energy would it take? To float free of Earth's gravity in a 150 metric ton spacecraft, you would need a superconducting coil, a sizeable rotating ring and a magnetic field that cranks out some 25 Tesla, or half a million times our magnetosphere's output. We already have magnets that can generate those powerful fields and if money was no object, we'd be able to try it out right now. The problems begin with trying to test how fast we could go using this technology. Heim himself never specified exactly how we'd be able to get a relativistic velocity. The actual mechanics of the hyperdrive come from an extension to his theories by retired patent clerk, Walter Drcher, and he's a little fuzzy about what will happen when we crank up the drive to full power. One of the possible outcomes is that the speed of light for our hypothetical spacecraft would increase.
While Drcher's designs might not work and Heim's ideas might be off in some critical places, this work can give us some interesting new directions in which to push the physics of warp drives. At worst, we can create a sample hyperdrive and see what happens. Maybe we'll still be one step closer to learning how to manipulate the fabric of space and time in an unexpected way…
Heatmaps are visual representations of data and, in case of websites, point out with which content people interact with, how deep a page they scroll, how they move the mouse around the screen, etc. This is done by tracking the mouse clicks and mouse movement of the visitor.
Different heatmaps can be generated, depending on what is being tracked by the tool you use. The most common ones are clicks, movement and scroll depth. Click heatmaps allow you to analyse the clicking behavior, movement heatmaps will show you how people move their mouse over the screen and the scroll depth shows you how far the page people scroll down the page.
So that was a small intro on what heatmaps are. Now let me show you some of the tools! I started out with Crazy Egg a long time ago but have tried several alternatives.

A while ago, Crazy Egg was a free service, but that's not longer the case. They have various payment-options and if you have a look at the demo, you'll notice that 9$ a month is not that much. If you prefer to have a free alternative for Crazy egg, you can just keep on reading…
I also wrote an extensive review about Crazy Egg if you're interested in this tool. It includes a link, giving you the opportunity to subscribe for a 60 day free trial.
Hotjar
I have been using Hotjar since the early Beta version and I am actually very happy with it. The tool is really easy to set up and produces useful heatmaps per device (desktop, tablet and mobile phone) and per type (click, move and scroll). This means a nice variety of options to analyse and gain insights from.
But it doesn't stop there for Hotjar because they offer so much more than heatmaps. Other features include live recordings, funnel analysis, polls, surveys and even live user tests via screen sharing.
Every feature is enabled for the basic (free) account but restricted in use. Really worth your time to check it out. If you would like to know more about Hotjar's other features, you check out the review.
Smartlook
Smartlook is a bit of a special one in this list. Not only does it integrate session recordings, heatmaps, event tracking and funnels for the web environment, but also for native mobile apps. Both iOS as Android are possible via an SDK. Although still in beta, things are finally looking up for native app users.
The session recordings are pretty detailed and offer a lot of filtering possibilities. It also has a few other tricks up its sleeve. For example, you can add notes to the session or look at the console of the user. Another nice and useful touch is that you can connect the recording to individual users from your database through an API.
The heatmap track clicks, moves and scroll depth of the visit and you can filter them on several parameters. When setting up a new heatmap, you can either collect data from new visitors (and new data points) or use historical recordings to populate the heatmap.
With event tracking, you can inspect every element on your website. You can either use a specified CSS selector or their built-in event selector tool. On top of that, you can specify special events that track JS errors in the console. A handy tool for developers to track javascript errors.
Last but not least, Smartlook allows you to create funnels, giving you some better insights where in the customer journey people start to drop off.
Smartlook has a free subscription which allows you to track 1500 visits per month. Of course it's limited in the amount of session recordings, the amount of generated heatmaps and the tracked platform. If you would like to track more sessions, generate more heatmaps and look at different platforms, you will need to upgrade to a Starters package (€19/month) or the Powers package (€79/month).
Mouseflow
Next in line is Mouseflow. Besides a detailed mouse click heatmap, it also offers a mouse movement and scroll heatmap. But it doesn't stop there.
Mouseflow is in fact a powerful web analytics package that gives you plenty of statistics and features to play around with. It records the pageviews, total visit length, interaction time (which I find very useful), bounce rates, loading time, response time and the scroll reach (in percentages and pixels).
On top of that, Mouseflow offers live streaming, a very nice feature with which you can follow your users live (only for paying subscriptions)! It also records whole visitor sessions, which you can play back in your browser or simply download to your hard drive to watch it whenever you want. These recordings include the mouse movements, clicks, scroll events and key strokes.
For only 10€ a month you get 1000 recorded sessions – which is a bargain – but if you're still not sure you can always start with a free subscription.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Mouseflow has just released a new version of their tool. Check out the new Mouseflow.
Lucky Orange
Next one is Lucky Orange, which has more features to offer than any other tool mentioned in this list. They have session recordings, heat maps and funnels. On top of that, they have also integrated a live chat functionality, polls and form analytics.
The heat maps are divided into clicks, moves and scroll depth. So what's so special then? Well, Lucky Orange doesn't simply take a ‘snapshot' of your web page but instead creates an interactive overlay as you browse your website. That's right people. Finally a solution for dynamic content and interactive interfaces! No need to worry about about menus, drop downs or popups any more.
You can easily switch between screen sizes and event types. Filter on behaviour tags (similar behaviour), keywords, source, browser, etc. and create segments for frequently used filter combinations, making it possible to define your personas for example.
Lucky Orange has several pricing plans. Pretty pretty good value for money I might add, but, unfortunately no free subscriptions. However, readers of paulolyslager.com will enjoy a 30 day trial instead of the normal 7 days. Just sign up and they will make the necessary changes for you!
MouseStats
Next one in line is MouseStats, which has several features to offer. They have session playbacks, heatmaps, form analytics and surveys.
The heat maps are divided into clicks, moves, scroll reach, viewport overlap, attention and areastats. The coordinates of the clicks are pretty similar compared to the other tools but they seem somewhat less refined (think bigger blobs).
MouseStats has also included the services of Unbounce, Instapage and Optimizely, giving you the possibility to generate a different heat map per A/B test variant for example.
The session recordings will show you, besides the actual video, the duration of the visit, the amount of pages during the sessions and some other details such as OS, browser, screen size and whether it was a touch device or not. In all honesty, I've seen better implementations of this feature.
MouseStats has several paid plans available, but they also offer a free life-time plan. All of the above features are enabled in this free plan, but highly reduced in the amount of recordings.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame has once again accused France of "participating" in the 1994 genocide in an interview to mark the 20th anniversary of the mass killings.
Kagame gave an interview - to be published on Sunday - to the weekly Jeune Afrique, in which he denounced the "direct role of Belgium and France in the political preparation for the genocide".
"Twenty years later, the only thing you can say against them (the French) in their eyes is they didn't do enough to save lives during the genocide," Kagame told Jeune Afrique.
"That's a fact, but it hides the main point: the direct role of Belgium and France in the political preparation of the genocide and the participation of the latter in its very execution," Kagame said.
He also accused French soldiers who took part in a military humanitarian mission in the south of the former Belgian colony of being both accomplices and "actors" in the bloodbath.
Rwanda is marking the 20th anniversary of the atrocities that claimed at least 800,000 lives, mainly of minority Tutsis.
Paris has repeatedly denied the accusations and insisted that French forces had striven to protect civilians.
Kagame's FPR rebels overthrew the Hutu-led government, and his party still controls the government, but many of those accused of the worst crimes of the war escaped, allegedly under the cover of a French military mission.
In 2008, a report by Rwanda's MUCYO commission of inquiry concluded that France had trained the armed groups that carried out killings and French troops had taken part in massacres. It accused 13 politicians and 20 officers by name.
Kagame's assertions came as relations between Kigali and Paris - which were completely frozen from 2006 to 2009 - have improved, notably since France last month, in a landmark ruling, sentenced former Rwandan army captain Pascal Simbikangwa to 25 years in prison for his role in the massacres.
It was the first trial in France to punish those responsible for the three-month wave of violence.
French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira will be on hand in Kigali on Monday at events marking the sombre anniversary.

Protesters stormed into Macedonia's parliament on Thursday after an ethnic Albanian was elected as speaker.
A brawl broke out injuring scores of people, including the Social Democrat leader Zoran Zaev, who was left with blood pouring down his face.
The protesters, supporters of ex-Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's VMRO party, are demanding new elections.
Politics in the former Yugoslav republic has been deadlocked since an inconclusive election in December.
But the crisis goes back further, to a phone-tapping scandal two years ago.
Mr Zaev has created a coalition with ethnic Albanian parties, but his attempts to form a government have been blocked by the president.
Macedonian nationalists have been protesting on the streets since Mr Zaev tried to form the coalition.
Image copyright EPA Image caption Social Democrat leader Zoran Zaev was among those injured after a fight broke out
Ethnic Albanians make up around a quarter of the country's population.
The people who stormed parliament were angered by the coalition's decision to elect Talat Xhaferi as speaker
They fear moves to improve the status of Albanians threaten Macedonian unity.
Some of the 200 protesters were masked. Witnesses saw broken glass on the floor and traces of blood in hallways.
Police fired stun grenades to disperse protesters and allow politicians to exit the parliament building.
On Friday, the interior ministry said 102 people had been treated in hospital, including 10 MPs and police officers, AFP news agency reported.

A statement from the US Embassy in Macedonia, published on Twitter, said: "We condemn the violence in the strongest possible terms.
"It is not consistent with democracy and is not an acceptable way to resolve differences."
The secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted that he was "shocked" by the "attacks".
"All parties should respect democratic process and engage in dialogue, not violence," he wrote.
"Violence has NO place in Parliament. Democracy must run its course," tweeted European Union Commissioner Johannes Hahn.
Skopje has also seen regular protests against the coalition by demonstrators who believe it will damage the country's national unity.
Macedonia came close to civil war in 2001 after an Albanian uprising.
Inspiration is a 1915 American silent drama film written by Virginia Tyler Hudson and directed by George Foster Platt and starring Audrey Munson. It is notable for being the first non-pornographic American film to feature full nudity of a woman. On reissue in 1918, the film was called The Perfect Model. All copies of the movie are believed to have been lost.[1]
Plot [ edit ]
A young sculptor searches for the perfect model to inspire his work. He finds a poverty-stricken girl who he thinks is the one he has been looking for. When she wanders off, he visits all the famous statues in Manhattan hoping to find her again.
Cast [ edit ]
Release [ edit ]
Inspiration was released November 18, 1915. Thanhouser's publicity department issued a press statement titled "Inspiration, a Study in Thanhouser Ideals", an interview some newspapers captioned in terms that implied that the studio advocated nudity in motion pictures. Producer Edwin Thanhouser wrote a letter to the editor of The Morning Telegraph to correct that impression: "I wish to state that our five-reel Mutual Masterpiece Inspiration was viewed and passed on by the National Board of Censorship without a single alteration."[2]
Reception [ edit ]
Promotional brochure interior
"Inspiration presents a decided novelty, for it is the first moving picture in which the nude figure of a woman has been used for artistic reasons only," wrote The Morning Telegraph, which reported Munson's credentials as one of the most famous artist's models in the United States. "Miss Munson's classic beauty and her remarkable poise absolutely remove every suggestion of the objectionable," wrote the reviewer. "George Foster Platt, who directed the picture, has used the utmost delicacy producing the picture, and it would have to be a very prudish person who could find any serious objection to the film. The story is too insignificant to sustain the interest for five reels, but the many beautiful poses of Miss Munson will do more than make up for the lack of a good plot. The picture will attract more than usual interest and the delicate and attractive way that a difficult subject has been filmed will no doubt receive the praise it deserves."[2]
Likewise, a reviewer for The Moving Picture World regarded the story as "slight and conventional", while another credited the film for "presenting a conventional but reasonably diverting story. … Moreover, it may be noted in favor of Inspiration that it possesses an artistic, and at times, even an educational value. Good taste has been displayed in the handling of scenes that might easily become coarse."[2]
Critics praised the third reel of the film, which details the difficult process of molding Munson's body in plaster for the casting of a sculpture.[2]
"At last true art has stepped into the motion field and it is all due to Audrey Munson, the Panama-Pacific model who has gained much fame about of late owing to her shapely figure," wrote Variety. "There is a bit of a story. It is trivial, however. It is about an artist unable to get a satisfactory model. His friends find a country girl who never posed before. She needs the money. She is capable from the minute she starts and immediately wins fame for the sculptor. There is a bit of love mixed in with the model and artist being joined at the altar. After all the posing that girl did that boy took no chance whatever when he married her, for there was nothing hidden from him. It is one nude pose after another. Miss Munson is always the central and bare figure. The picture has an educational trend as well as being artful. This will make some dizzy, but bookers should get busy. It's a cuckoo."[2]

WASHINGTON — House Ethics Committee ranking member Ted Deutch fled from The Daily Caller and his office refused to respond to emailed questions about his knowledge of former House IT employee Imran Awan, who is now charged with multiple counts of bank fraud and previously worked for the Florida lawmaker and other Democrats.
Last week, TheDC asked Deutch about the IT staffers as he walked down the steps of the Capitol, but Deutch motioned to his middle school daughter being with him and complained that he could not answer the question at the time.
“You know as much as I do,” Deutch said.
TheDC pressed further, but Deutch said his office would be available to respond to any other questions. (RELATED: House IT Aides Fear Suspects In Hill Breach Are Blackmailing Members With Their Own Data)
Deutch's office had been previously contacted by the The Daily Caller News Foundation's Luke Rosiak about the issue multiple times since May, but no response had been given. Another email to Deutch's communications director Jason Atterman was sent after the Florida congressman refused to talk about what he knew about Awan last week.
(RELATED: House Dems Hired A Fired McDonald's Worker As Their IT Guy)
That email was not responded to as well.
On Monday, TheDC faced Deutch again and asked about what he knew about Awan and he refused to talk about it once more.
TheDCNF previously reported in a series of pieces that Awan and three relatives were all colleagues who worked for House Democrats as IT aides and were investigated by Capitol Hill Police for breaching congressional computers without permission.
WATCH:
TheDCNF later reported that congressional IT staffer sources revealed Democratic members were intensely loyal to the IT staffers under investigation and some wondered if these members were being blackmailed from the contents of the emails the IT staffers had access to.
Not all Democrats who previously employed Awan avoided TheDC, however.
New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries told TheDC, “We had instant communication with Capitol Police about any potential breaches and nothing has been called to our attention as it relates to all of this. I can't speak to any other offices, but they haven't sounded any alarm bells with respect to personal information or sensitive information that may have been misappropriated from our office.”
The House Ethics Committee, which Deutch helps lead, has yet to get involved in the matter, and some members suggest that law enforcement should start with the Pakistani IT staffers and then seriously look at members of Congress who employed them.
“I think members acted in an irresponsible fashion and perhaps in an unethical fashion. There's a real question as to why you would pay people and shared staff that much money individually or cumulatively and how these individuals at such a young age had such a claim to do the service that they clearly weren't doing,” California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa told TheDC Tuesday night.
Issa added, “[Law enforcement] should start with the criminals and work backwards.”

Twitter.com/CantorRelief After taking $89 million in losses so far in 2017, one trader is doubling down on bets the US stock market is in for a rude awakening.
The mystery trader's investment vehicle of choice is the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, a measure of expected price swings in US equities that serves as a barometer for investor nervousness. It generally climbs as stocks fall, so purchases of VIX contracts translate to bearish wagers on the S&P 500.
On Wednesday morning, the trader, nicknamed "50 Cent" by Macro Risk Advisors because of their predilection for contracts that cost roughly that much, bought an additional 100,000 VIX calls betting that the index will climb about 40% by May.
And MRA doesn't think the trader will stop there. The firm expects purchases of bullish VIX contracts to continue in the coming days.
It wouldn't be the first time — 50 Cent has gradually amassed holdings of about 1 million VIX calls through three occasions so far in 2017, and each time a significant portion of the premium paid has expired worthless. The most recent example came on Wednesday, when 725,000 of 50 Cent's contracts expired without making any money, MRA data shows. Perhaps the fourth time is the charm.
So what has been the damage to 50 Cents bottom line? It's not pretty. Out of the $109 million the trader has spent this year buying the VIX, $89 million has expired worthless.
Blame the subdued VIX. The so-called fear gauge, which has a bull-market average of 18.78, was locked in a range of between 10 and 14 for the first three months of 2017. It has since climbed as high as 15.96, still well below where the measure has historically traded. It closed at 14.93 on Wednesday.
50 Cent's options would become profitable only if the VIX climbed to between 19 and 26, according to data compiled by MRA.
Still, positioning from hedge funds and other large speculators suggests the trader might be on to something. They haven't been this bullish on the VIX since the start of December, according to data from the US Commodity Futures Association.
To MRA, 50 Cents unwavering commitment to a VIX spike is a sign that hedging activity through the purchase of volatility is alive and well.
"The amounts of money 50 Cent is spending are large, but this could be just the tip of the iceberg when you consider all the hedging that takes place over the counter as well," Pravit Chintawongvanich, the head of derivatives strategy at MRA, wrote in a client note on Thursday. "Even in the listed space, there is plenty of hedging that takes place that may not be as obvious and predictable as 50 Cent, and thus harder to attribute to one person."
A sunspot five-times the diameter of Earth has fired twin flares at us, causing a geomagnetic storm that was forecast to peak on Saturday, 13 September.
AR2158 first exploded on Tuesday, followed by a more powerful eruption (classed as an X1.6) on Wednesday, briefly causing high-frequency radio blackouts, said Phys.org.
Both flares came with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), billions of tonnes of matter leaving the Sun at speeds of more than 3,750km/s, said SpaceWeather.com. Solar flares typically release energy in the range of billions of megatons.
The Sun has had bigger flares this year as it approaches the maximum point of activity on its 11-year cycle, but AR2158 was pointing pretty much straight at Earth, so will have greater effect.
Spectacular auroras were expected throughout northern latitudes on Friday, and might be seen as far south as Illinois and Oregon on Saturday. Observers in Tasmania were also on alert for the Aurora Australis. Telecommunications firms were bracing for interference.
America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's space weather prediction center said at 18:05UTC on Friday that the storms were moderate (G2 on a five-point scale) and were expected to reach G3 on Saturday.
A G3 storm could cause SatNav systems to become intermittent and high-latitude power systems might have to apply voltage corrections. Low-Earth-orbit satellites might suffer greater than usual drag, and require re-orienting.
The sunspot cycle is caused by the Sun's magnetic field interacting with its differential rotation.
On Earth, because it's a solid, the magnetic field rotates with the planet, once a day. But the Sun is a plasma. At its equator, one rotation takes 25 days, but at higher latitudes it slows to 35 days.
This means that the Sun's magnetic field is dragged forward faster close to the equator. As it gets out of synch with the polar areas, knots form in the field. And these knots contain huge amounts of stored energy. (See video from the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.)
Where the knots are tightest, heat from below is unable to escape. The surface of the Sun cools to under 4,500K (4,227C), compared to the surrounding temperature of 5780K.
These cooler areas turn dark (Actually they just look dark compared to their surroundings − they're ten times as bright as the full Moon), forming blemishes that can be seen from Earth.
Gallileo saw them in 1612, shining the light through a telescope on to paper and sketching them. Their motion gave him the first clue that the Sun rotated.
To further complicate the situation, Sunspots spin like hurricanes, tangling their magnetic fields still more, until they finally explode into a flare and/or CME.
This solar maximum, the busiest point on the sunspot cycle, was more than three years late in arriving and is one of the weakest on record.
However, it is getting far more attention than previous cycles because human civilisation is far more dependent on satellites and electromagnetic communications.
The response of Israel's Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz just one day after the attacks in Belgium was such an uncomfortable mishmash of schadenfreude, condescension and rudeness that it was easy to imagine someone had distorted what he actually said.
“If Belgians continue eating chocolate and enjoying life and looking like great democrats and liberals, and not noticing that some of the Muslims there are planning terrorism, they won't be able to fight them,” said the senior minister in a radio interview the day after the attacks. Adopting a somewhat reproachful tone, he seemed to be admonishing the Europeans for their lax policies in confronting international terrorism, compared with Israel's.
Katz's comments encapsulated the patronizing attitude toward Belgians coming from the Israeli political right immediately after the attacks, especially on social networks. Comments and the overall mood recalled the gloating arrogance expressed toward the French following the brutal terrorist attack in Paris in November.
Using Facebook as his platform, Katz's Likud colleague Minister of Science Ofir Akunis released an especially reproachful and condescending post about the Europeans. “Let me repeat myself,” the minister wrote. “Many in Europe preferred to focus on the vile condemnation of Israel, on marking Israeli products and on boycotts. At the same time, thousands of terrorist cells affiliated with radical Islam sprung up, right under the noses of the people living on the Continent. Some mocked those who warned them about this. Others ridiculed them. Unfortunately, reality struck full force, cutting short the lives of dozens of innocent people.” According to Akunis, Europeans were so obsessed with the Israeli occupation that they failed to notice the monster that is Islamist terror growing right under their noses.
Whenever terror strikes mercilessly in Europe, the entire spectrum of the Israeli right raises its head. It misses no opportunities to boast about having chosen the right path. The consequences are extremist rhetoric and domination of the country's security and even its nationalist dialogue. When enlightened Europe closed its eyes and provided immigrants with a home and a relatively easy life, they paid it back with terror. This chorus of “we told you so” is conducted by none other than Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He sets the tone and sends out his list of talking points. There is no one like Mr. Terrorism himself to explain to the world, “Our way is the right way.”
Obviously, the prime minister's propaganda machine didn't pass up this opportunity to strike out with his message. Netanyahu delivered it in a recorded speech broadcast to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention on the day of the attacks, and he expanded on it the next day, when he called a press conference in Jerusalem. “If there is any nation in the world that knows what they are going through, it is the people of Israel, who have been standing boldly and bravely in the face of terrorist attacks for many years now,” he said. “I offered them everything that Israel could do to help them in their fight against terrorism, including intelligence and security aid.” When Netanyahu was asked to explain why he has been unable to rein in the current Palestinian uprising, he explained that his government had made many achievements on that front, and then immediately changed the topic to the international war on terror.
Even more than Netanyahu is addressing the world, he is addressing the Israeli public. It is his way to achieve two important objectives: to relieve himself of some of the pressure due to Palestinian terrorism, and to explain why there is no partner in negotiations. Netanyahu also believes that as soon as all this clicks in Europe, no one in the international community will have the patience to hear about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Just as he did after the attacks in Paris, Netanyahu wants to send the message that the terrorism striking at Israeli civilians is the same Islamic terrorism that is attacking Europeans. “This is the common war being fought by the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness,” Netanyahu declared, in an effort to remove the occupation from the equation. Then, as Mr. International Terrorism, he offers the world his experience and assistance.
But it is not just Netanyahu. Yesh Atid Chairman Yair Lapid chose to use similar rhetoric. He also addressed first and foremost the Israeli public, which arguably is going through a process of radicalization. The terrorist attacks in Belgium caught Lapid just as he was returning from a demonstration in front of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva, a group he called “the Terrorist Rights Commission.” Lapid's comments were directed to the soft underbelly of the Israeli right, which he is trying to attract. Upon arriving in Israel, he wrote a Facebook post explaining, “The war against terrorism is a global war, and it should be waged globally. … All attempts by Western nations to keep it in the Middle East are destined to fail. [Terrorism] is lethal. It is spreading around the world. Its main goal is to shock, to interfere with life and to attack people's sense of security. And it has another objective: to harm Israel.” For Lapid, too, there is no time for talk about the occupation or a two-state solution when fighting global terrorism.
It's mid-way through January, meaning that NAMM is right around the corner. NAMM is one of the largest conventions in the musical instrument industry and is packed with gear announcements for DJs and producers. Lots of companies make product announcements and unveil their best working prototypes of things to come – so it's time to get excited! In this article, we look at some gear that we know will be at NAMM 2015 and also make some predictions on what surprises we might see.
PREDICTIONS: WHAT MIGHT BE AT NAMM 2015
Kontrol F1 MK2? Kontrol Z4? Traktor Pro 3?
Although Native Instruments doesn't participate in NAMM, they often make their own announcements around the same time period (Kontrol F1 and Traktor Pro 2.5 were announced shortly before NAMM 2012, Traktor DJ for iOS was announced right after NAMM 2013). Here are a few ideas at what they might be up to (pure speculation!):
The Kontrol Z4: 4 channel Traktor/standalone mixer. Ever since the release of the Kontrol Z2, people have been speculating and mocking up their own 4 channel dreams of the Z2. The Kontrol Z2 was just on sale last December which could mean they're trying to clear inventory for a Kontrol Z2 MK2 or Kontrol Z4 announcement.

The Kontrol Z2 was just on sale last December which could mean they're trying to clear inventory for a Kontrol Z2 MK2 or Kontrol Z4 announcement. A Kontrol F1 MK2: Unlike the Kontrol X1, the Kontrol F1 hasn't had any updates since it's original release. A Kontrol F1 MK2 would really benefit from some sort of screen on the controller so that DJ's can see what samples are loaded into the remix cells. The real challenge will be adding a screen without drastically increasing the controller size.

A Kontrol F1 MK2 would really benefit from some sort of screen on the controller so that DJ's can see what samples are loaded into the remix cells. The real challenge will be adding a screen without drastically increasing the controller size. Traktor Pro 3: Native Instruments has historically released major software updates every 2-3 years (Traktor Pro 2 was released Feb. 2011), so Traktor Pro 3 would make sense now. Many S8 owners have noted that it seems like the hardware has a lot of room for growth, and might actually be meant to be used with an upcoming software update. Previous major new versions usually consisted of a new/refined GUI and a few major features (sample/remix decks, coloured waveforms, and new FX). A few things DJs have been looking for is video support, easier controller mapping, and Maschine integration – maybe these features will make their way into Traktor Pro 3?
Serato/Ableton Bridge 2.0
The Bridge was a collaboration between Serato and Ableton originally announced way back at NAMM 2010 (Check out DJTT review of the Bridge). The software allowed Serato Scratch Live users to open their Ableton Sessions inside of SL. DJs could launch MIDI/audio clips in time from Ableton alongside track decks and they could control their Ableton FX, all from inside the Serato window.
Another feature, Mixtape, allowed Scratch Live DJs to record a mix and export all the track info, fader, and EQ automation to Ableton. DJs could then open their mix as an Ableton Project File and see their entire mix, including track info and automation, from start to finish. This made it easy for DJs to fix any mistakes with their mix inside Ableton.
Bridge had a lot of potential, but ultimately it never seemed to catch on. It had a tough learning curve and many DJs were disappointed that you couldn't scratch Ableton clips from within Serato. While the Bridge hasn't seen any updates since it's original release, the Serato team recently announced in an interview with DJ City that they have been taking feedback and that an update to the Bridge would be released in 2015. Hopefully we'll get a first peak at NAMM!
Pioneer DDJ-SR2 + Pioneer DDJ-SP2
Last August, Pioneer released the DDJ-SX2, which included features that were previously only available on the flagship DDJ-SZ controller:
Multi-color RGB pads
DVS support
Dedicated Serato Flip controls
Improved LED feedback with the jog wheels
The DDJ-SR and SP1 haven't had any updates since their release. Based on the updates that were made with SX2, it's a safe bet that the SR2 will include RGB pads, “Flip” controls, and hopefully some LED feedback (non existent on the current model) from the jogwheels.
The DDJ-SP1 (check out DJTT full review) recently saw a price drop, which could be a signal that it will see a refresh as well. Since this controller is basically replica of the pad and FX section of the SX/SR, you can expect RGB pads and Flip controls. Also, Serato recently announced new Expansion bundles, so it's possible that they could include an expansion with the purchase of a Pioneer DDJ-SP2.
Ableton Live 9.2 + New Push Features
The Ableton team has been pretty quiet since the release of Live 9.1. The team has continued to release incremental software updates to refine Push and Live but there hasn't been any major features added since 9.1.
What new features could we see in 9.2 or Push? Ableton could perhaps take inspiration from Maschine's 2.2 update and add one button chords and an arppeggiator to Push. While Ableton does have an arpeggiator and chord MIDI effect, making these features quickly accessible through the Push hardware would be a great workflow enhancement. Ableton could also borrow ideas from their newest competitor, Bitwig. The latest version has some unique features – support for 3 displays, project tabs, and side by side session/arrangement view – that would be welcomed with open arms from any Ableton user.
Wearable DJ Tech
In the last two years, there's been a massive push in the rest of the consumer electronics space to incorporate new technology into wearable gadgets. We don't think there are too many realistic applications for DJs right out of the bat, but NAMM is also where some companies show off prototypes and wild ideas, so you never know.
Arturia Polybrute
Arturia has been putting out great cheap analog synthesizers for the last few years at NAMM, but the one major piece of feedback seems to constantly be users asking for multi-voice syntheziers. Watch the above video to hear what a Polyphonic Microbrute might sound like!
NAMM 2015 Revealed: What We KNOW Is Coming
Korg ARP Odyssey
Classic analog gear continues to be in demand. Recreations such as the Korg MS-20 and Roland Aira series have been well received by musicians who want analog sound without hunting down expensive vintage gear.
Korg has announced plans for another recreation of a legendary analog synth from the 70?s, the ARP Odyssey. Korg made the original announcement in February 2014 and planned to release the new Odyssey in September 2014, but it looks like they experienced some delays. The ARP Odyssey is known for it's unique sound and innovative performance controls. Korg has brought on Mr. David Friend, the lead designer of the original ARP Odyssey, as a chief advisor to the project. This should ensure that the new Odyssey remains faithful to the original design and sound.
Akai's Advance Keyboard Series
Akai has announced a new lineup of keyboards, the Advance Keyboard. The Advance keyboard is available in 25, 49, and 61 key configurations. Each model has 8 MPC pads with RGB backlighting, 8 performance knobs, and a custom Akai Pro keybed.
The main highlight of the keyboard is the high resolution 4.3 full color display, which gives users the ability to browse/load presets from their VST instruments and view/control VST parameters. The keyboard can control all the major DAWS and it includes it's own standalone host for VST's.
LoopMasters' iOS AudioCopy Store
LoopMasters has quietly made a move that we suspect will take the iOS mobile production market by storm in the next few months, launching a new sample pack store in collaboration with Retronyms that allows easy use of the samples in any iOS app that supports AudioCopy – like Launchpad, Garageband, Arturia, and more.
Arturia's New “Next Generation” Audio Interface
Arturia teased a new generation of high quality audio interface in December, set to be unveiled next week in Anaheim – but right now all we know about it is that it addresses a lot of the main issues with common interfaces like the Apogee Duet. The list of challenges on Arturia's site indicates that their new soundcard has solutions for:
Breakout cables and focus around a single knob interface
Connectivity that only works with particular inputs / outputs / pieces of software
Latency (who isn't trying to solve latency issues?)
Signal/Noise ratio and harmonic distortions
Mixed In Key 7
Mixed In Key has just released version 7 of their popular key detection software. The latest release adds a very unique feature, automatic cue points for Traktor/Serato. The software will analyze multiple tracks then set up to 8 cue points inside the track. This is a welcome tool that should speed up the track preparation workflow Traktor and Serato DJ's. For more details, check out the original announcement.
Casio XW-DJ1 + XW-PD1
We're not sure if this has anything to do with Star Wars Episode 7, but Casio has released two new products that appear to be inspired by the Millennium Falcon. The XW-DJ1 is a platter style controller designed to be used with Algoriddims djay2 app with dedicated controls for cue points, tempo sync, effects and looping.
The second product form Casio, the XW-PD1 is a standalone alone production box. The X1-PD1 uses the same sound engine as Casio's widely-popular XW series of synthesizers and is controlled by 16 velocity-sensitive pads and 4 knobs for fast music production. For more details, check out the full announcement.
DJTT Community Predictions
The DJTT community has the unique ability to sometimes predict gear before it's even been announced. Members of the community are very crafty with Photoshop and can create things that end up closely resembling a final product, such as the Kontrol S8. So we want to hear or see 2 things from you:
Realistic predictions for NAMM 2015 (ex. new Serato FX expansion) Out of this world predictions (ex. Virtual Seraktor Pro – bonus points for a mockup)

"Well, I suppose I'd better start finding names for things..." was the first thing said by the ill-fated sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus Linnaeus, 1758) in Douglas Adam's Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. Such is the richness of life that, unlike that whale, mankind is still naming things. Without commonly accepted names there would be no way to communicate research about life and it is the profession of taxonomists to put names on organisms and describe the different forms of life on Earth.
The EU e-Infrastructure coordination project "pro-iBiosphere", targeting the preparation of the European Open Biodiversity Knowledge Management System, makes ten recommendations to increase the adoption of digital workflows in the biodiversity domain. The recommendations include a "focus on usability and interoperability of software, not just functionality; fostering openness with research data"; and aim at giving further stimuli to the engagement of taxonomists with digital technology. The complete list is available in the report "The use of e-tools among producers of taxonomic knowledge". The document is based on a workshop and training organised by the project with 100 participants, a questionnaire answered by 220 persons including taxonomists and related professionals, literature review and conversations with taxonomists.
One of the attendees at the pro-iBiosphere workshops said "pro-iBiosphere is helping to close the gap between technology and taxonomists". Thibaut DeMeulemeester, Postdoctoral researcher (Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Leiden, the Netherlands).
Taxonomy has traditionally been a paper-based occupation and due to the rules on naming priority it relies heavily on the vast corpus of literature that has accumulated since the works of Carl Linnaeus. Yet, other scientists, conservationists and resource managers are crying out for a more transparent, stable, available and linked system of names. This can only be achieved digitally, openly and on the internet.
The need for a digital system of taxonomy is higher than ever. Modern metagenomic methods have been developed that can extract DNA sequence from 'soup' containing hundreds of species, many of which that cannot be linked to known species and some of which may in fact be new species to science. This is an exciting new technique with the potential to teach us much about microbial ecology, evolution and diversity. Yet it presents a challenge to taxonomy. The potential for generating thousands of DNA sequence from hitherto unrecognized species means that our ability to connect the genetic and biological data with their names will be severely tested. Only a digital online system of taxonomy can hope to keep up with these exciting developments.
pro-iBiosphere aims at binding together the disparate disciplines of the life sciences and envisages the digital-taxonomist providing the names that glue it all together.

But the question that is giving so many Republicans heartburn today is how a man so few took seriously is suddenly a leading presidential contender. Listening to Mr. Trump as he campaigned across the country over the past week, and talking to the people shouting “U.S.A! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” who crammed into halls and ballrooms by the hundreds and sometimes thousands, shed some perspective on his appeal, and on the void he is filling in Republican politics.
Mr. Trump is not, as many Republicans have suggested, merely a renegade agitator who sneaked up on the party establishment and threatens to spoil its plans for a tidy, civil primary. Rather, he has become the new starring attraction for the restless, conservative-minded voters who think the political process is in need of disruption.
Some align themselves with the Tea Party movement. Others call themselves independents or Republicans who are just fed up. The praise they heap on Mr. Trump — “He speaks the truth,” “He's fearless,” “He's not politically correct” — echoes the words conservatives have used to describe others, like Sarah Palin and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who have stirred their passions before.
“I think he means what he says,” said Kristi Eglody, 63, a retired school counselor from Manchester. “He loves America, and he wants it to be better. And that's what I love about him.”
Jerry DeLemus, 60, of Rochester, N.H., said he liked the idea of voting for a candidate who had not been in politics very long and found Mr. Trump's swagger inspiring. “You won't leave confused about where he stands,” he said. “And how fun would it be to watch him debate Hillary Clinton?”
A dream of mine has come true. Yesterday, I sat down to a meal of chicken nuggets and Oreos with the legendary Ivan Reitman. Growing up in the 90's I wasn't old enough to see most of his movies in the theaters, but my mom did rent them for me at our local Blockbuster. I was constantly playing and rewinding the VHS tapes of Ghostbusters, Meatballs, Twins, Junior and my Kindergarten Cop (my personal favourite – don't judge me!). These timeless films continue to live on today, and are still incredibly funny 20+ years after their creation. On the odd occasions that I do watch cable, I can almost guarantee one of these funny and familiar films will be playing; I've watched Ghostbusters during the Halloween season at least half a dozen times. I grew up with Ivan Reitman's movies. I never imagined I'd get to sit across from him on a leather couch and shoot the shit. This has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Thank you, Ivan, for taking the time and being so gosh darn cool!
Before meeting Ivan Reitman yesterday afternoon a small group of journalists (6!) and I were checking out The VOID. It's an immersive, location-based entertainment company that has opened within The Rec Room here in Toronto (I'll have an article about The Rec Room tomorrow). The VOID have created a hyper-reality Ghostbusters: Dimensions Experience inside the 40,0000 square foot venue that is absolutely incredible. I've gotten my hands on all kinds of VR experiences but nothing of this scale. This is the best use of VR I've ever witnessed.
The Ghostbusters experience is much like a ride you'd find at somewhere like Universal Studios or Disney Land. It's a pilot project for the city of Toronto with hopes of it expanding across the world in the future. Players strap into a VR headset and full bodysuit equipped with a gun that acts as your Proton Pack from the movies and embark on a journey to save New York City. Your adventure will see you progress through an immersive experience, connecting and engaging with others and your surroundings through sight, touch, smell, and motion. By combining interactive sets, VR, real-time effects, and custom RAPTURE gear, the ride propels users beyond the confines of reality, immersing them in a VR experience unlike ever seen before.
My biggest takeaway from the adventure was how much we as participants bonded. Myself and Drew (from Game Moose) know each other quite well – we host a podcast every week. Our other two companions were strangers (Hi Raju!). By the end of the experience we were high-fiving and we felt like close friends, sorta like a team of longtime Ghostbusters. I've never experienced or seen anything like this in VR. Usually VR is done alone and sure you can watch someone else partake but they don't know you are there. With the Ghostbusters game I could see my comrades and interact with my comrades – we could reach out and touch each other if we wanted. Some puzzles inside the experience required our team to put our heads together to solve the problem and save the city.
Without giving too much away (I believe going in blind for an experience like this is the way to go) I have to say that what happens within that room is magical. I found myself dancing out of the final door after taking down the last big bad guy and laughing with pure joy. It was an incredibly fun experience. I truly felt like I had been transported out of Toronto and into the Big Apple and assumed the role of a Ghostbuster for an afternoon.
It's also worth noting that before going in you can choose your gender and race so each experience is customized to you. You won't be able to see yourself but your team will. This is a great feature that I'm glad was not overlooked.
The Ghostbusters: Dimensions experience was developed in partnership with The VOID, Ivan Reitman and Sony Pictures Virtual Reality which leads us to our conversation after with Ivan and his thoughts on Virtual Reality. Mr. Reitman has compared the Ghostbuster VOID experience to the 1984 original film; “both projects truly break new ground in terms of a new form of storytelling” a similarity that attracted him to the project.
About two years ago Reitman watched a VR production by two French Canadians that got his attention, getting the wheels turning about a use of simple spatial experience to create a story He quickly realized that this was going be a very complicated thing to do; that his goal would essentially be to create a new language. One that would let him tell a story with incredible effects without having the audience miss a beat.
“There was a great old film producer/director called William Castle who used to do all these great 3 dimensional effects, and I used to go as a kid, at the Alhambra Theatre here in Toronto, and I remember there would be stuff like a Ghost on a chain that would come out from behind the screen. He really believed in these, I think he was the first person to try Smell-O-Vision, and this is like a very highly advanced version of that, where you really feel like you are in the room“, stated Reitman.
It was after that experience that he took a trip down to the VOID headquarters in Utah to see a project they were working on called Curse of the Serpent's Eyes. This was the first VR project that really blew him away.
“We're at the point of the Great Train Robbery in terms of where this is, and you compare it to the history of film. I've done mostly comedies in my life, which are really a group experience but we now enjoy those films on our DVRs but the strength of them was to enjoy them with 300 people in a dark room. And there's something about laughter and fright that works best in a room full of people, so we have to rediscover how to do that. I think it's really possible. But we're not going for jokes in the same way. It's about taking the historical ways of creating a story effect and just redefining it for how people are going be watching it and how you use the specialty and intimacy around you. It's very intimate. Things are very up-close in a way that no 3-D movie can be. 3-D in a film just doesn't do that” stated Reitman, discussing future of VR, and his creative process with the VOID.
When asked if he is surprised by Ghostbusters longevity, he's extremely humble and calls it, “a very special part of his life, especially for a Canuck“. You can hear in his voice that he really appreciates all the fans that have kept the franchise alive. He calls Ghostbusters, “a contemporary Wizard of Oz and has made him feel very fortunate”.
When talking about magicians and magic Reitman compares VR too, “Creating the misdirection. It's actually direction (laughs). So you need the audience to look at the right place when they need to, and other times being free to experience.”
The Ghostbusters ride is about 12 minutes long; Reitman is confident that there are plenty of other experiences to be had in VR. “We want all want to sit back and be swept away. There's going be a series of new experiences that see you sit back and get taken for the ride but in a more interactive way than you've ever had. There are ways you can become a partial storyteller but the real storyteller is manipulating you to go on the ride they've created. That's what creates the various forms of emotionality. Everything from fright to laughter to adventure to arousal, so it will be all sorts of things.“
Before leaving he shared with us that, way back before Tim Burton directed Batman, he had been working on a Batman and Wonder Woman script that unfortunately never saw the light of day, but he was absolutely in love with the recent Wonder Woman film and sent his love to Patty Jenkins the director.
I also learned that Reitman is an avid gamer at 70 years old. He was raving about Jon Favreau's VR title, Gnomes & Goblins and also spoke about his experience playing Bethesda's new DOOM VR title. He says he is “always looking for the next big thing.“
Ivan and the team behind the Ghostbusters experience intentions were to use the VR technology to tell a story and bring a group of people together. I can say without a doubt they succeeded beyond my wildest expectations and I can't wait to see what they dream up next.

IF YOU WANNA SPOIL THE EXPERIENCE HERE'S A TRAILER:
The delayed implementation of a Bitcoin Core update by a small number of the network's miners resulted in the addition of invalid transaction blocks to the bitcoin blockchain this weekend.
The result was a fork in the network that created two versions of the bitcoin blockchain, which continued for six blocks on 4th July. An additional three invalid blocks were added to the blockchain in a repeat of the issue the following day.
As a result, Core developers issued a warning on Bitcoin.org requesting that wallet providers place increased scrutiny on incoming transactions due to the risk that funds could be double spent as a result of the discrepancy between chains.
The post, which is still live on the website, is advising these entities wait an additional 30 confirmations before considering transactions valid.
Root of the problem
At the heart of the issue is arguably the decentralized nature of the bitcoin blockchain and the degree of control over which its participants have in how they contribute to the verification of transactions on the digital currency's distributed ledger.
This ability for users to have some control over how they interact with the network, for example, results in miners being able to neglect software changes and for the network to carry on even if they do.
As a precaution, Core developers have taken to waiting for a majority of the miners to implement changes. In this case, BIP66 – a bitcoin soft fork designed to make the network less dependent on OpenSSL's signature parsing – stated that certain transaction blocks created without this update would be considered invalid once the majority – 950 out of 1,000 blocks – were mined with the latest version.
In theory, the risk of an issue was low, with only 5% of the network running the outdated version of BIP66. However, in practice, three pools running light versions of software elements were able to process six consecutive blocks that should have been invalid, creating two versions of the bitcoin blockchain, the longest of which was operating on an older software.
In this case, certain mining pools were SPV mining, meaning that they were not validating the full version of the bitcoin blockchain. In turn, these invalid blocks were being considered valid by bitcoin wallet providers and block explorers running SPV versions of software as opposed to full nodes with the entire history of the ledger.
Fabio Federici, CEO of blockchain intelligence provider Coinalytics, explained to CoinDesk:
“SPV clients were claiming they would follow the BIP66 rules, but they were not actually enforcing them. A big part of the mining network is not running on full nodes, which would validate every transaction.”
Though initiated by F2Pool, should the other mining pools have been running a full node to process the entirety of the bitcoin blockchain, invalid blocks should have been more quickly detected.
Common consensus
Though not unusual with software updates, the situation was noteworthy as the invalid block was subsequently built upon by the larger mining network.
Peter Gray, founder of bitcoin developer API Coinkite, noted that issues with software updates are common, resulting from the continual upgrades being made to the payment network.
“I think it's useful to remind people that forks happen every week on bitcoin. Typically only a single block gets orphaned in a typical week, and it's not a bug or attack or anything; just the way bitcoin works,” Gray said.
Mining firms that solved invalid blocks lost income as a result of the need to correct the issue, with Bitcoin.org estimating that $50,000 in revenue was effectively withheld from F2Pool, AntPool and BTC Nuggets, the three mining pools that effectively created and briefly propagated the invalid chain.
Rewards were ultimately never paid as the 25 BTC winnings per block was sent to a bitcoin wallet that invalidated the blocks after syncing with the valid chain.
After effects
In its warning, Bitcoin.org, said customers whose bitcoin transactions were confirmed before midnight (UTC) on 6th July have not been affected by the glitch, though transactions carried out after this time are believed to have “significantly less reliable” confirmation scores.
Bitcoin.org explained the confirmation of invalid blocks is due to software clients not upgrading to Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 or later and warned that lightweight wallets using SPV and web wallets were particularly vulnerable to the bug.
Warning the issue remained unresolved, Bitcoin.org urged users to “wait 30 more confirmations” than usual before accepting a transaction as valid. It also recommended that miners switch to a pool that validates transaction blocks using a full node and that individual miners use Bitcoin Core 0.10.2.
As for larger takeaways, those who provided comment suggested the event should be used as a reminder of the need for key bitcoin network participants to run full nodes.
“The key takeaway is the distribution of full nodes versus SPV nodes. Everyone should run a full node, and maybe it doesn't make sense economically or there are other benefits of an SPV client, but that comes with the risk,” Federici continued.

KILLEEN, Tex. — Leaders of the vibrant Muslim community here expressed outrage on Friday at the shooting rampage being laid to one of their members, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who had become a regular attendee of prayers at the local mosque.
But some of the men who had befriended Major Hasan at the mosque said the military should examine the policies that might have caused him to snap.
“When a white guy shoots up a post office, they call that going postal,” said Victor Benjamin II, 30, a former member of the Army. “But when a Muslim does it, they call it jihad.
“Ultimately it was Brother Nidal's doing, but the command should be held accountable,” Mr. Benjamin said. “G.I.'s are like any equipment in the Army. When it breaks, those who were in charge of keeping it fit should be held responsible for it.”
The mosque, the Islamic Community of Greater Killeen, sits off Highway 195, near Fort Hood. Major Hasan began attending prayers about two months ago.
The mosque has about 75 families who have lived peacefully with their Christian neighbors.
“After 9/11, nothing happened here,” said Ajsaf Khan, who owns three convenience stores with his brother, Abdul Khan. “We are very cooperative.”
A mosque leader, Dr. Manzoor Farooqi, a pediatrician, when asked if he feared retribution for the shootings, said he hoped good relations would prevail.

Major Hasan was one of about 10 men from Fort Hood who attended prayers in their uniforms, Dr. Farooqi said, and he was shocked to see the major's face on television identified as that of the gunman. “He is an educated man. A psychiatrist,” he said. “I can't believe he would do such a stupid thing.”
“I have no words to explain what happened yesterday,” Dr. Farooqi said at Friday afternoon prayers, in which about 40 men were led by the mosque's imam, Syed Ahmed Ali. “Let's have a moment of silence to bless those who lost their lives.”
“The Islamic community strongly condemns this cowardly attack, which was particularly heinous in that it was directed at the all-volunteer army that protects our nation,” Dr. Farooqi said.

Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, “We reiterate the American Muslim community's condemnation of this cowardly attack. Right now, we call on all Americans to assist those who are responding to this atrocity. We must ensure that the wounded are treated and the families of those who were murdered have an opportunity to mourn.”
Among those attending Friday prayers at the Killeen mosque was Sgt. Fahad Kamal, 26, an Army medic who wore his Airborne uniform, and later he said he was angered on several levels. “I want to believe it was the individual, and not the religion, that made him do what he did,” said Sergeant Kamal, who returned to the United States last year after a 15-month tour in Afghanistan. “It's an awful thing. I feel let down. We're better than this.”
It was Major Hasan, though, who increasingly felt let down by the military, and deeply conflicted by his religion, said those who knew him through the mosque. Duane Reasoner Jr., an 18-year-old substitute teacher whose parents worked at Fort Hood, said Major Hassan was told he would be sent to Afghanistan on Nov. 28, and he did not like it.
“He said he should quit the Army,” Mr. Reasoner said. “In the Koran, you're not supposed to have alliances with Jews or Christian or others, and if you are killed in the military fighting against Muslims, you will go to hell.”
Mr. Benjamin, who worked as a private contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan after leaving the Army in 2000, said the military should have let Major Hassan resign. “They should take more consideration of the human beings in the uniform,” he said, “rather than simply say, ‘We invested our money in you and need to get our money's worth.' ”
Still, Mr. Benjamin added, Major Hassan had overlooked an important, and peaceable, tenet of Islam. “We do have the right to retaliate,” he said, “but he who does not is twice blessed.”
Customized Classic Novas to Get You Through the Day
The Chevy Nova is one of the best cars made during the muscle car era; no one in their right mind would argue with that. However, the classic Nova is also one of the most underrated cars of the time. With the addition of a few parts here and there, these already cool cars can be taken to the next level. That's exactly what the following amazing Novas prove.
1966 Nova Goes from Smashed to Showstopper
Not only is this an awesome build, it's a story of redemption. This 1966 Nova suffered some major damage before the customizations. A large portion of the car had to be completely redone with Chevy Nova replacement parts. It now has a 588 cubic inch engine and 600 horsepower, and almost every inch of this classic Nova has been beefed up in some way.
Diesel Powered Twin Turbo Nova
This rat rod custom 1966 classic Nova is one of kind. The most notable customization is what powers the build. Under the hood, you'll find a twin turbo diesel engine. The Duramax engine even looks stock inside the engine bay!
Pristine Powerhouse Nova
This awesome machine has appeared in many magazines. Over the course of three years, it's had more than 3,000 hours put into the build. The mods are too extensive to list, but it does have an LS7, not to mention twin turbochargers, a supercharger, and an 8-port nitrous oxide system
Beastly '72 Nova
This classic Nova is a mean machine. It's powered by 700 horsepower and is super clean. This classic Chevy Nova is pure street beast.
Super Sleeper Classic Nova
This 1972 Nova looks pretty run of the mill, yet it's anything but your average 1972 Nova. This twin supercharged build puts 1,160 horsepower to the wheels!
Pro-Touring 1967 Nova
Built up by professionals on a rust free body, this Nova is drool worthy. It has custom body work, suspension, brakes, and tons more.
Slick 1966 Nova
Sinister is a word that comes to mind describing this Nova. It has a Dart 400 engine with aluminum heads and hydraulic valve train. The suspension has also been upgraded, and a custom SS interior polishes it off.
A Show Nova with Some Kick
While this is more of a collectible than a race car, it's a well-rounded build. It's powered by a professionally built small block. It also has Flo-Tek headers and an Edelbrok intake under the hood. Additionally, it's rocking polished Torque Thurst II wheels and a few other goodies.
Owning any of these classic Chevy Novas would make most gear heads proud. They are customized just right with a touch of class.
Callum Wilson joined Bournemouth in the summer from Coventry
Bournemouth one point clear of second-placed Norwich
Middlesbrough a point further back in third
Cherries have won six of their last eight
Wilson has scored in each of last three games
Callum Wilson's 22nd goal of the season edged Bournemouth closer to the Premier League after a tense win at Reading.
Wilson tapped home from close range after Andrew Surman's initial shot had bounced back off the post.
Bournemouth needed a stunning one-handed save by Artur Boruc from Jamie Mackie's volley to help seal a vital three points.
The Cherries have a one-point lead and superior goal difference at the top of the Championship with three games left.
Norwich stay second, although Watford can join them on 82 points if they beat Nottingham Forest on Wednesday.
Middlesbrough also have not given up the chase for automatic promotion, with their victory over Wolves moving them to 81 points.
The race for the top flight remains extraordinarily tight and although victory confirmed a place in the play-offs at the very least for Bournemouth, manager Eddie Howe's side have their sights set on the league title.
Eddie Howe (centre) and his players applaud the 4,000 travelling Bournemouth fans
With one eye on Saturday's FA Cup game against Arsenal, Reading manager Steve Clarke could have been forgiven for fielding a weakened side. However, he made just one change to the team that drew with Blackburn at the weekend and his side gave the league leaders a stern test at the Madejski Stadium.
The Cherries, roared on by vociferous away support of over 4,000 fans, made a blistering start, though, stunning the home crowd after only four minutes.
Wilson side-footed home from the six-yard box after Surman's initial shot from 18 yards came back off the post.
Reading rallied and only a superb, point-blank save by Boruc from Mackie's close-range strike kept the Cherries in front.
Bournemouth's remaining games 18 April: Sheffield Wednesday (home) 27 April: Bolton (home) 2 May: Charlton (away)
The Royals' Jordan Obita later blazed over from a promising position, while Bournemouth's Yann Kermorgant floated a header wide of Reading keeper Adam Federici's post.
Matt Ritchie came close to doubling the lead on the hour, his fierce curling strike from the corner of the penalty box fizzing just wide, and Steve Cook later had a shot saved by Federici.

The closing stages were scrappy and niggly but despite intense late pressure, which included five minutes of injury time, Boruc was not tested and Bournemouth held on, inching ever closer to their first promotion to the top flight.
The Royals remain 18th, eight points above the relegation zone, with Clarke's men having four games left to play.
Reading assistant boss Kevin Keen told BBC Radio Berkshire: "For manager Steve Clarke we were just about the better team, but the best team in the league won.
"We deserved at least a draw, we were competitive, but sometimes football is like that
"Confidence can carry you at this time of the season and hopefully this time next year we'll have that confidence.
"If you give Bournemouth a goal head start it is very hard. Artur Boruc save was outstanding but that typifies a team at the top of the league. Like I said I thought we deserved a draw."
With the flurry of diplomatic maneuvering over the Palestinian Authority's plan to seek recognition at the UN next week, it's worth remembering the financial obstacles that will face those living in the Palestinian territories, whatever does or does not happen at the UN.
A new World Bank report out this week puts the Palestinian economy – and the PA's near-total dependence on aid – front and center. Palestinian economic problems won't be addressed at all by what happens at the UN, where Palestinians say they will press for full membership as a sovereign state.
That's unlikely to happen since the US has vowed to wield its veto on the Security Council, which controls the membership process. But even if Palestinians succeeded, or got a lesser upgrade to their current status, any prospects for major improvements will remain firmly in Israel's hands.
The World Bank says that recent economic growth in Gaza and the West Bank has been almost entirely thanks to foreign aid, that a slowing of foreign aid delivery has presented the PA with a possible fiscal crisis, and that Israeli policies continue to stand in the way of sustainable economic improvement in the territories.
The report says that the Palestinian private sector "remains stifled by Israeli restrictions on access to natural resources and markets. Under these conditions, lower-than-expected aid flows in the first half of 2011 had an immediate impact on the Palestinian economy. Real GDP growth, steadily increasing in 2009-10 and previously projected to reach 9 percent in 2011, is now expected to be 7 percent. The shortfall in external financial support in the first half of 2011 has also contributed to the current fiscal crisis facing the Palestinian Authority."
The World Bank review comes at the end of a two-year program of institution building that Palestinian leaders hoped would set the stage for an independent state. It gives Palestinian bureaucrats high marks: "In areas where government effectiveness matters most – security and justice; revenue and expenditure management; economic development; and service delivery – Palestinian public institutions compare favorably to other countries in the region and beyond." But it says there's little within the PA's own power that they can do to produce sustainable economic growth.
Why? "Ultimately, in order for the Palestinian Authority to sustain the reform momentum and its achievements in institution-building, remaining Israeli restrictions must be lifted," the World Bank says. "The resulting revival of the private sector can be expected to grow the tax base and gradually reduce dependence on external assistance. Until then, however, West Bank and Gaza will remain vulnerable to reductions in aid flow, and these will need to be managed carefully."
The economies in the West Bank and Gaza have of course grown at relatively high rates in recent years, and unemployment has declined. (The World Bank says overall Palestinian unemployment is now 19 percent, though that's out of the only 40 percent of the population still seeking work.)
But it seems to imply a dramatic reversal in fortunes is possible if the aid taps are turned down, or off. It says growth was from a low base and that while Israel eased restrictions on Palestinian trade in 2009, "there has been little further easing since."
US could withhold aid
The US is going all out to stop the recognition bid, and has threatened to withhold the roughly $550 million in annual aid that it gives the Palestinians.
Speaking at a Monitor breakfast this week, US Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice flatly said that it would work against Palestinian interests.
But the reasons for Palestinian frustration aren't hard to find. Settlements have expanded in the West Bank since the Oslo Accords, freedom of movement and trade remain severely restricted there by Israel, and Gaza continues to confront a crippling economic blockade.
If the Security Council blocks the Palestinians' bid for full membership, the UN General Assembly, which convenes Sept. 20 in New York, could upgrade the Palestinian mission to nonvoting observing status. But even that would do little to change things quickly. It amounts to an attempt by its supporters to redefine the terms of discussion from a peace process that seems no closer now to ending with a Palestinian state than it did a decade ago, to one in which in Israeli – and perhaps close allies like the US – are framed as the obstructionist party.
Maen Rashid Areikat, the Palestinian ambassador to Washington, told the Monitor yesterday that UN recognition is "an issue of national pride for a people who want to be independent and free.... I don't think it's the natural role for the US to block the admission of a state... (it's) not compatible with US principles.”
Israeli restrictions
While Israel has relaxed some security measures in the West Bank that have allowed for greater economic activity, other restrictions have increased, particularly in Gaza. The World Bank report says that since 2002, Israel "has progressively added materials, machinery, and equipment (including telecommunications equipment) to the list of items considered 'dual-use' ” in Gaza. Dual-use refers to materials that Israel deems a potential military threat. Israel "now allows most consumer goods and many intermediate inputs to enter Gaza. However, it restricts the entry of most construction materials. In addition, [Israel] still prevents all exports from Gaza except for a limited amount of agricultural goods."
The West Bank has severe restrictions of its own. Israel "still does not allow any Palestinian development in the 60 percent of the West Bank comprising Area C. In addition, [Israel] maintains strict controls on the passage of goods and people between Israel and East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank." (Area C is a term introduced by the Oslo Accords that refers to West Bank areas under Israeli control, including the major Israeli settlements.)
The whole report is worth a read. The takeaway is a simple one. A lasting peace between two real states side by side will rely on, at least in part, on a much stronger Palestinian economic base. For the moment, the chances of real economic improvement remain slim.

Brussels, 24 May 2016 - SWIFT
SWIFT CEO Gottfried Leibbrandt delivered the keynote address at the 14th annual European Financial Services Conference in Brussels today. During the speech, Leibbrandt announced SWIFT's five-part Customer Security Programme, to reinforce the security of our shared, global financial system.
The five part-plan, includes initiatives to:
Improve information sharing among the global financial community;
Harden security requirements for customer-managed software to better protect their local environments, enhance our guidelines and develop security audit frameworks for customers;
Support banks' increased use of transaction pattern detection to identify suspicious behavior; and
Introduce certification requirements for third party providers.
The following is Leibbrandt's speech as prepared for delivery:
Hello and thank you for having me here today.
Cybersecurity is serious. It's a critical issue for the financial system – and it's a critical issue for SWIFT. Cyber concerns are not new to us at SWIFT. Indeed, ever since I took on this job, cyber risk has been the main thing to keep me awake at night. We work very hard at improving the cybersecurity of our network; every day we wake up and go to sleep thinking about, and protecting against that threat. It is hard work and never done. And rightly so for SWIFT. After all, we are trusted by our clients to carry billions of high value payment messages a year. This requires a network that meets the highest standards in terms of: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
Our network was designed to meet these challenges. Cybersecurity is part of our DNA – it is not an afterthought. Not just hardware and software, but people, processes, procedures, checks, in fact a whole organisation for whom “failure is not an option”.
So, as we've said a few times before these past few months, let me repeat: SWIFT, our network, software and our core messaging services have not been compromised. Ensuring that remains the case is, and always will be, SWIFT's top priority.
But the financial industry, as a community, has to be clear that cyber risk is big; there will be more cyberattacks. And inevitably some will be successful. Acknowledging this doesn't mean we are resigned to it. Rather, it means that we must work even harder at our collective defensive efforts.
Recent Cyber fraud events are a watershed event for the industry
Let me turn to the recent fraud at Bangladesh that has caught multiple headlines. I think it will prove to be a watershed event for the banking industry; there will be a before and an after Bangladesh. The Bangladesh fraud is not an isolated incident: we are aware of at least two, but possibly more, other cases where fraudsters used the same modus operandi, albeit without the spectacular amounts. The banks were compromised, credentials to payment generation systems were obtained to send fraudulent payments and the statements/confirmations from their counterparties were obfuscated.
So this is a big deal. And it gets to the heart of banking.
Keeping money secure is core business for banks. So these events are a problem on at least two fronts.
First it's a problem because banks that are compromised like this can be put out of business. It's not like retailers losing credit card details or telcos losing customer details. Telcos and retailers will take reputational hits, and may face some financial liabilities, but things will move on. When banks lose control of access to their payment channels, it's different. In the recent cases, thieves were able to move just some of those banks' overseas assets. As a result, for the banks concerned, the events haven't been existential. The point is that they could have been.
Second, it's a problem because the financial system is hugely interconnected and it operates on trust.
What about SWIFT?
At this point two questions pop up for SWIFT, at least they have in the press: 1. Isn't SWIFT in the middle of all of this? 2. What are you going to do about it? Let me answer both in turn, since the answer to the first forms the basis of the second.
As I said above, SWIFT, our network, software and our core messaging services have not been compromised. In Bangladesh and the other cases, the thieves compromised the IT environment and worked their way to the bank systems where the SWIFT instructions are generated and the confirmations received. And while we (and other providers) give tools and software to our customers, our customers run these in their own environment and need to keep them secure. We cannot secure our customers' environments and cannot assume responsibility for that.
At the same time, we play a crucial role in the global payments system, and the events form a direct threat for that system. We therefore very much want to be part of the solution. We think we can be and we have to be.
The need to share information
Over the past weeks and months, we have already stepped up our efforts, notably on sharing information.
The gravity of this threat is the very reason that all of us in the global financial community have to be willing to share that information. Through trusted channels, of course; but we have to share.
Banks can learn from one another about the modus operandi and put better preventative measures in place; entities like SWIFT can serve as the information sharing channel, and we can develop indicators of compromise to help those banks improve their detective capabilities. We are doing so.
But information sharing needs to get better, much better. It is critical that the global financial community works together to bolster our mutual security.
We are calling for a collective effort in our global financial community to reinforce the security of our entire, shared system.
Our security is our collective mission and can only be strengthened through a collaborative approach which includes SWIFT, third party suppliers, policymakers, regulators and our users, big and small. And particularly the large clearing banks – many of whom I see here today - have a really important role to play; your networks of relationships means that you can have a truly global, viral effect.
And we are going to do much more. We are the global bank-owned cooperative at the heart of the global payment system, a system that is facing a persistent threat. We are stepping up to the plate as our owners and overseers expect us to.
Customer Security Programme
Indeed, we are working with our community on a five-part customer security program that we will announce later this week; five big initiatives that mutually reinforce each other. We are reaching out to customers to discuss with them in more detail and answer any questions.
First, as I just mentioned, we aim to drastically improve information sharing among the global financial community. We will demand more information of our customers, and share that back with the community. The ambition is to do on an international scale what banks in several countries are already doing domestically. We will do it in a confidential way that uses the data while protecting the identity of the institution and customers.
Second, we will harden security requirements for customer-managed software to better protect their local environments.
Third, we will enhance our guidelines and develop security audit frameworks for customers.
Fourth, we will look to see what we can do to support banks' increased use of payment pattern controls to identify suspicious behavior.
And finally, we will introduce certification requirements for third party providers.
This requires Cooperation
This will only work if the industry works together. Banks, regulators, third-party providers and SWIFT. SWIFT is not all-powerful, we are not a regulator, and we are not a policeman; success here depends on all the stakeholders in and around the industry. The security of our network remains our key priority; the security of their own environments has to remain (and, for some, become) banks' priority.
Innovation
Let me close by returning to innovation.
The opportunities that innovation has brought banks and their customers are tremendous – technology and connectivity have introduced the sector to cyber risk. Back before mainframes, ATMs, mobile banking and PCs, it was all about men and guns. Now it is about men and hoodies hunkering over keyboards. And as we continue to connect everything to everything, things will get ever more challenging.
We are seeing some really exciting advances in innovation – and that's great. The banking experience is immeasurably better today than it was a few years ago – inside banks as well as outside. Let's have more of that. But these amazing technological advances open the door for increasingly complex cyber threats, the problem must become the solution – technology is essential to our cybersecurity.
Now more than ever, we need to see innovation in security – we're seeing some, after all, the famous AES algorithm was designed less than 30 km away from here, but let's have more.
You all know what I'm talking about – bring on the next generation of pattern recognition, monitoring, anomaly detection, authentication, biometrics—and a host of innovations we have yet to develop that will improve and preserve the security of our industry.
We need more of these incredible innovations, and just as importantly, our industry needs to use more of what's already available to us.
The cyber challenge is huge, and demands action, and change, by all stakeholders. And change is hard. Sometimes it takes a crisis. As the saying goes: “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste”; so let's use this crisis as an industry to come out stronger, better and even more secure.
Thank you.

BILL PLASCHKE Paying college players is an inherently bad idea
As allegations swirl around Auburn's Newton, the concept gains traction. But to do so would mean contracts would replace scholarships, and forget the illusion anyone would go to class.
With coaches making millions while players can barely afford dinner, is this fair? No. With universities building libraries on the spines of their studs, is this just? Absolutely not.
Colleges should not play players. Colleges cannot pay players. To do so would hurt the very athletes supposedly being helped, devaluing intercollegiate sports until they're not worth the paper that a freshman linebacker's contract is printed upon.
It's a universal notion, an accepted wisdom, a common question for which there can only be one answer.
For Bush's sake, wouldn't this all be a lot simpler if colleges just started paying their athletes?
I see you queasily watching college football's latest financial collapse. I feel that glint of recognition as you witness the impending NCAA-led destruction of Cam Newton and the Auburn Tigers. I know you are nodding your head and thinking the same thing.
But the beauty of college athletics lies directly in this paradox, a nation drawn to the idea of professional games played by amateurs, millions cheering for superstars in letter sweaters, inspiration bathed in innocence.
If you pay the players, that aura is gone, and with it, a sports experience that is singularly passionate and uniquely American.
"Rationally, it would make sense to pay college athletes," said Dr. Murray Sperber. "But college athletics is one of the most irrational parts of American life."
Sperber, you might remember, is the former University of Indiana professor who was once vilified for being the lone critical public voice against former basketball tyrant Bobby Knight. Sperber has written several books about the problems of big-time collegiate athletics, and is now a visiting professor in the graduate school of education at UC Berkeley.
I phoned him Thursday as the allegations mounted that the father of Heisman-favored Newton sought money for his son's collegiate enrollment.
We know that, when leaving junior college after last season, Newton's first choice was to play for his former Florida offensive coordinator Dan Mullen at Mississippi State.
We know that, at the last minute, based on the influence of his father, Cecil, Newton changed his mind and committed to Auburn.
We have been told by various sources through various media outlets that Newton's father had asked Mississippi State for $180,000 to sign Newton, and that the Bulldogs refused.
At this point, it is impossible to guess anything other than somebody connected with Auburn did not refuse.
"I would bet my house on it," said Sperber with a laugh. "Are you kidding me?"
And if that guess is wrong, blame a system where even the most scrutinized player on America's most scrutinized team — yeah, Reggie Bush — could not stay clean.
To which critics have devised a simple solution — just pay the kids already. Give them salaries commensurate with their value to the university. Compensate them for the 40-hour workweek that is college sports. Heck, could somebody just throw them a bone?
DONE DEAL! Mario Balotelli training at Liverpool after his £16m AC Milan move [Pictures]
It's done. Mario Balotelli is a Liverpool player.
Before either AC Milan or Liverpool had officially announced the transfer of Super Mario from the San Siro to Anfield, the Daily Mail got their hands on pictures of the Azzurri centre forward in Liverpool training gear.
Red fans will be hoping that Balotelli can help plug the gap left by Luis Suarez's departure to FC Barcelona, whilst, at £16m, most consider the deal to be a bargain for Brendan Rodgers' team.

US car giant Ford says it is recalling about 850,000 cars in North America over a "potential issue" with airbags.
The carmaker said a glitch could cause a short circuit that may mean airbags do not deploy properly in the event of a crash.
The vehicles affected include some 2013-14 C-MAX, Fusion, Escape and Lincoln MKZ models.
Ford said it was not aware of any injuries caused by the problem, adding that dealers would fix it for free.
About 745,000 of the recalled vehicles are in the US, 82,000 are in Canada and 20,000 in Mexico.
Last weekend, rival General Motors recalled more than 220,000 cars over a brake defect, bringing the number of cars it has recalled this year to more than 15 million.
A caller reported a man "outside her window having sex with a fence" Wednesday at a duplex in North Austin, according to an arrest affidavit.
Eleodoro Estala, 32, was arrested for indecent exposure after he was seen exposing himself and making lewd gestures around 11:25 a.m. Wednesday at a residence off North Lamar Boulevard, according to the affidavit.
The caller told police she was looking out of her duplex window and saw Estala, her neighbor, urinating on the side of the fence that separates their property, according to the affidavit.
The woman started filming Estala with her cell phone, and the man saw her and took off his clothes, the affidavit reads.
According to the affidavit, Estala put his mouth on the chain link fence and stuck his tongue out.
The woman then saw Estala begin to "have sex with the fence," according to the affidavit.
The woman showed police several photos and videos of the incident on her phone, the affidavit said.
When police arrived to the scene, Estala appeared to be intoxicated, officers wrote in the affidavit.
Estala was uncooperative and told police he was inside his apartment, the affidavit reads.
Estala's bail was set at $2,500, according to the affidavit. Travis County Jail records do not show that Estala is currently in custody.
The Sato Project is dedicated to rescuing abused and abandoned dogs in Puerto Rico. Since its inception in 2011, The Sato Project has largely focused its efforts on a place unfortunately known as “Dead Dog Beach” in the municipality of Yabucoa, one of the island's poorest. We have rescued over 3,000 dogs to date, rehabilitated them with the highest standards of veterinary care and placed them in loving homes in the mainland U.S. We are addressing the underlying causes of overpopulation, abandonment, and abuse through community outreach and a low-cost Spay, Neuter, Vaccine and Microchip Program. Since the devastation of Hurricane Maria, The Sato Project has evacuated over 1,600 dogs to safety and is working to keep families with their beloved pets, and to help the many animals left behind in the storm's aftermath.
In Manhattan, the upscale clothing retailer Barneys will replace the bankrupt discounter Loehmann's, whose Chelsea store closes in a few weeks. Across the country, Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants are struggling, while fine-dining chains like Capital Grille are thriving. And at General Electric, the increase in demand for high-end dishwashers and refrigerators dwarfs sales growth of mass-market models.
As politicians and pundits in Washington continue to spar over whether economic inequality is in fact deepening, in corporate America there really is no debate at all. The post-recession reality is that the customer base for businesses that appeal to the middle class is shrinking as the top tier pulls even further away.
If there is any doubt, the speed at which companies are adapting to the new consumer landscape serves as very convincing evidence. Within top consulting firms and among Wall Street analysts, the shift is being described with a frankness more often associated with left-wing academics than business experts.
“Those consumers who have capital like real estate and stocks and are in the top 20 percent are feeling pretty good,” said John G. Maxwell, head of the global retail and consumer practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Like many shows, “90 Day Fiancé” has its own Reddit thread where fans of the series discuss the show and its stars. One of the most popular couples to discuss is Anfisa and Jorge Nava. The Russia native is a self-proclaimed gold digger, though she said it was a joke. Many noticed a comparison between them and “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna. Like Anfisa, many accused Chyna of using Kardashian for his money (and fame).
For some quick background, Chyna started out her career as a stripper. She later became a video vixen and became involved in a relationship with “Rack City” rapper Tyga. Soon, she was the new BFF of Kim Kardashian. Later, after Tyga left her for Kim's younger sister, Chyna started to date Rob — which seemed suspect to nearly everyone except him.
TRENDING: ‘90 Day Fiancé' Star Anfisa Nava Says Jorge ‘Constantly Lies'
In a Reddit theory from Saturday, cutiehoney996 called Kardashian a “huge sap” since Kardashian bought the failed sock designer bought lavish gifts for his ex-fiancée and she broke up with him after they had their daughter.
That's where the netizen saw a connection between the four reality stars. “As for Jorge, he's paying for the bills of his wife after she kicked him out of his own home. At least Anfisa was forthcoming about her intentions with Jorge. I was watching recent episodes and my mom couldn't help point out the similarity of Rob and Jorge. Both saps and broken down men,” the user said.
Another user, who didn't exactly agree with cutiehoney996, noted both Kardashian and Jorge have domineering sisters who then chose strong women to be in relationships with. In turn, the sisters for both men were not happy with their brothers' choices. The Kardashian sisters swiftly blocked Chyna when she tried to trademark the name “Angela Renee Kardashian” and Jorge's sister, Lordes, told Anfisa she only “opens her legs” when Jorge buys her stuff.
“The Kardashian women can't criticize Chyna because their behavior is why Rob chose her, and Jorge's sisters/mom can't criticize Jorge because their behavior is why he's attracted to Anfisa's domineering ways,” AtomicDoggett wrote Saturday. “Apple never falls far from the tree.”
While many seemingly portray Anfisa as the villain in the relationship, “there are two sides to every story,” she told International Business Times in an interview Friday.
TRENDING: Jorge Gets Anfisa's Name Tattooed On His Ring Finger
“I wouldn't say that TLC portrays me unfairly, but I think that a lot of viewers only focus on my bad actions and totally ignore the fact that Jorge constantly lies and plays a victim when actually he brought it all on to himself,” she said.
As for the gold digger title, Anfisa said it was a joke. “Another important thing that I think a lot of people don't get is my sense of humor,” she said. “Do they really think I'm going to come out on national television saying basically, ‘Hey, I'm a gold digger' and be serious about it?”
So what's next for the couple? Don't miss Anfisa and Jorge “90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?” when it airs Sunday at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.

by Neil Cole Actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan has reportedly been spotted on the Chicago set of "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" in the role of Bruce Wayne's father, Thomas. Back in August, a portrait of Thomas Wayne which greatly resembled a bearded Morgan was photographed on set and now it appears as though the actor is indeed portraying the character. In the following image, the "Watchmen" actor is seen alongside his wife, Martha and a young Bruce during the filming of a scene Wednesday night as the Waynes leave a theater screening of "The Mark of Zorro." Featured below is video from the same film shoot which shows the Waynes possibly being confonted by Joe Chill, their infamous murderer from the comics. "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" is scheduled to release in theaters on March 25, 2016.
This weeks episode of The Milo Yiannopoulos Show featured conservative author and commentator Ann Coulter, for her second appearance on the show.
The pair discussed everything from Hilary Clinton and the support she receives amongst black communities, saying that “Obama's been a disaster for race relations but Hillary doesn't strike me as someone that would do remarkably better.”
They also discussed the inevitable subject of Trump, with Coulter saying that should Trump lose the election, it could mean the end for the GOP. She added that as well as a Hilary presidency being “the end of the GOP,” it would also bring about “the end of the country” as we now know it.
Another subject was analysing how the media manipulated Trump's star of David tweet, which led to some left-wing commentators describing it as “anti-semitic. Coulter concluded that she thought “it would be better if he did not send out loutish low-brow tweets,” something Milo firmly disagreed with.
Milo also gave Coulter a “fag pass,” saying that he would give her “a lifetime fag pass, so if you ever get in trouble for calling someone gay, you come to me and I'll set them right.”

Measuring the atmospheric pressure of a distant exoplanet may seem like a daunting task but astronomers at the University of Washington have now developed a new technique to do just that.
When exoplanet discoveries first started rolling in, astronomers laid emphasis in finding planets within the habitable zone — the band around a star where water neither freezes nor boils. But characterizing the environment and habitability of an exoplanet doesn't depend on the planet's surface temperature alone.
Atmospheric pressure is just as important in gauging whether or not the surface of an exoplanet may likely hold liquid water. Anyone familiar with camping at high-altitude should have a good understanding of how pressure affects water's boiling point.
The method developed by Amit Misra, a PhD candidate, involves isolating “dimers” — bonded pairs of molecules that tend to form at high pressures and densities in a planet's atmosphere — not to be confused with “monomers,” which are simply free-floating molecules. While there are many types of dimers, the research team focused exclusively on oxygen molecules, which are temporarily bound to each other through hydrogen bonding.
We may indirectly detect dimers in an exoplanet's atmosphere when the exoplanet transits in front of its host star. As the star's light passes through a thin layer of the planet's atmosphere the dimers absorb certain wavelengths of it. Once the starlight reaches Earth it's imprinted with the chemical fingerprints of the dimers.
Dimers absorb light in a distinctive pattern, which typically has four peaks due to the rotational motion of the molecules. But the amount of absorption may change depending on the atmospheric pressure and density. This difference is much more pronounced in dimers than in monomers, allowing astronomers to gain additional information about the atmospheric pressure based on the ratio of these two signatures.
While water dimers were detected in the Earth's atmosphere as early as last year, powerful telescopes soon to come online may enable astronomers to use this method in observing distant exoplanets. The team analyzed the likelihood of using the James Webb Space Telescope to make such a detection and found it challenging but possible.
Detecting dimers in an exoplanet's atmosphere would not only help us evaluate the atmospheric pressure, and therefore the state of water on the surface, but other biosignature markers as well. Oxygen is directly tied to photosynthesis, and will most likely not be abundant in an exoplanet's atmosphere unless it is regularly produced by algae or other plants.
“So if we find a good target planet, and you could detect these dimer molecules — which might be possible within the next 10 to 15 years — that would not only tell you something about pressure, but actually tell you that there's life on that planet,” said Misra in a press release.
The paper has been published in the February issue of Astrobiology and is available for download here.
Cape Town, South Africa (CNN) A South African teen kidnapped as a newborn and reunited with her parents this month is "broken" after her ordeal, her father says.
Zephany Nurse, who is now 17, was seized from a Cape Town hospital in 1997.
Since then, she has been raised by the woman who allegedly abducted her, authorities say.
In a strange twist, she lived in the same city as her biological parents, who admit she's having a hard time adjusting to her new reality.
"She's broken, and we'll fix it," said her father, Morne Nurse.
The 50-year-old woman accused of kidnapping her was freed on bail Friday after the government agreed she's not a flight risk. The suspect is not allowed to contact potential witnesses, including the teen.
"We are very concerned with the well-being of the young woman," Social Services Minister Albert Fritz said. "She's taking on her last year of schooling. She's doing very well. She's a strong, assertive young woman, and it's clear she was brought up in a good home."
Fritz said his department is approaching the case with "extreme" sensitivity.
"We are concerned with the well-being of everyone involved, the young woman, her biological parents," he said, "but also can't forget about the father who believed she was his daughter."
A captivated nation
The Nurses case has stunned the nation, with throngs attending Friday's bail hearing. The courtroom in Cape Town was so crowded, her biological parents had nowhere to sit.
Nurse was allegedly kidnapped at birth and found after an improbable coincidence. She was living and going to school in Cape Town, where her biological family lives.
South African police said the woman, who was arrested last week, has been charged with kidnapping and accused of pretending to be her biological mother.
Close resemblance
The teen crossed paths with her biological parents after they unknowingly enrolled their second daughter at the same school she attends.
Fellow students told the younger daughter that someone at the school bore a striking resemblance to her, according to the South African Press Association, an independent news agency.
The second daughter, who was born four years after the kidnapping, started eighth grade at the school this year, the news agency reported.
After other students told her a girl in her final year of school looked just like her, she befriended her, the news agency reported.
Eventually, Celeste and Morne Nurse met their younger daughter's new friend and were so taken by the similarities, they contacted authorities.
Police arrested the woman after a DNA test.
'Under the circumstances, I am doing fine'
The teen is in the custody of social services. Her parents have been allowed to visit her for short periods, the news agency reported.
She released a statement, via the Centre for Child Law, which is representing her.
"I want to say thank you to all the people who supported me through this, for continuously praying and never giving up on looking for me," she said.
"Under the circumstances, I am doing fine."
The alleged victim hasn't been identified because she is a minor. The media have given her the name Zephany to ensure her privacy.
The suspect returns to court on May 29.
CALANGUTE: Russian Information Centre head in Goa Ekaterina Belyakova on Sunday stated that Russia has not removed India or Goa from the list of safe destinations, but the authorities 'did not discuss Goa or India in the safe destination list'.In a press release, she said “In our previous statement, we have noted that Russian authorities did not discuss including Goa or India in the list of ‘safe' destinations recommended by Russian government to Russian tourists. We say (sic) that Russian government only discussed the list of countries recommended for visits (holidays).”Belyakova said that certain parts of her statement regarding Russian charter tourist arrivals in Goa issued on Saturday have been misrepresented. “Our statement did not have any information regarding removal of India from the list of ‘safe' countries' or including India in the list of ‘unsafe countries' as was mentioned in several reports in Indian media. TOI had reported as in the original statement that “Unfortunately, both India and Goa, is not discussed as a promising direction for Russian travelers.”She added that her earlier statement said “According to the news agency INTERFAX, November 26, 2015, first deputy speaker of the Parliament of the Russian Federation, Ivan Melnikov, offered to convene a ‘roundtable' to make proposals to improve the availability of new, safe tourist destinations for Russians - such as Cuba, south Vietnam and southern China”. This is the quote from Interfax, and India is not discussed here.Belyakova said “The main focus of our statement was to show the prospects for Goa that will open if Goa becomes an alternative destination instead if Egypt and Turkey.” Certain incidents in the last couple of years including fights with rude taxi drivers and increasing price levels have made it difficult for Russians to make Goa a holiday destination of choice.With Turkey and Egypt being off the radar for Russians, she said if India can become a friendly country and capitalize on the opportunity, at least some part of 7 million tourists can think of travelling to Goa. “Whether Goa is ready to host so many Russians and will India really become one of the "friendly countries" that was mentioned by the vice-speaker of the Russian parliament? Would taxi drivers not overprice and not be rude, seeing a white man, and the owners of houses and hotels give discounts to Russians who come always for more than 10 days of holidays,” she asked.
Tulsi loves Islamophobic genocidal Indian fascist Narendra Modi
I don't really know Tulsi Gabbard. When she was running for Congress in 2012 she called and asked for a Blue America endorsement. Her opponent was Mufi Hannemann, an especially contemptible conservative and a real nightmare for progressives. But Gabbard had some problems of her own. Her Republican family led the anti-gay crusade in Hawaii. Her father, a fount of homophobic psychosis is a state Senator who switched parties-- though not ideology-- so he could have more influence. I was worried about Tulsi but she sounded pretty good in our discussion, especially in regard to what I sensed to be anti-war instincts and pro-environmental instincts. I was leaning towards recommending an endorsement but when I asked her about the homophobic stance that she claims to have shed, she grew brittle and quickly ended the conversation, saying she'd call back. She never called back and Blue America never endorsed her. She beat Hannemann in the primary for the Hawaii seat that encompasses basically all of the state outside Honolulu and went on to quickly earn an "F" from ProgressivePunch. Her crucial vote score (73.46) makes her the 142nd "most progressive" Member of Congress, i.e., very much not progressive.
Before getting married in 2015, she was dating GOP Mafia thug Michael "Mikey Suits" Grimm, before he was arrested, tried and imprisoned in a case that didn't even touch on over 90% of his criminal life. Even worse, she often worked across the aisle to further the GOP agenda, joining the widely discredited Republican front organization for dummy-Dems, No Labels. And then she was righteously outraged by Debbie Wasserman Schultz's DNC cheating on behalf of Hillary and everything changed for Tulsi. She denounced Wasserman Schultz, quit the DNC and endorsed Bernie, with whom she shared almost no policy goals, other than some anti-war stands.
Tulsi's district is one of the bluest in America-- the PVI is D+21, even more Democratic than the Honolulu district. Obama won the district against McCain 73-25% and beat Romney 71-27%. There are no political reasons to amass a Republican-lite record and turn herself into an anti-Obama Fox regular. She's done it because it's who she is and it's what she believes. She may keep her homophobia under wraps, but she's released it with Islamophobia and she sounds uncomfortably more like Trump than like Bernie. Like Trump, she has also been an outspoken admirer of Vladimir Putin's. In the August 13 primary she faces an actual progressive challenger , author Shay Chan Hodges. (Unfortunately, as of the June 30 FEC filing deadline, Gabbard had raised $1,361,505 and spent $558,948, while Hodges had raised $3,104 and spent $147.
Daily Beast, Last week, Tim Mak became one of the few national journalists to give the race a look. In his post for the Tulsi Gabbard: The Bernie-Endorsing Congresswoman Who Trump Fans Can Love , pointed out the absurdity of her progressive red when "her stances on standard liberal issues like gun rights and immigration are starting to converge with those of Donald J. Trump... She's a lawmaker who has a soft spot for dictatorial regimes. She pals around with Sheldon Adelson. She's declined to sign onto an assault weapons ban. She opposes admitting refugees. She is a frequent fixture on Fox News, where she has slammed the president over his refusal to use the term “Islamic extremism” to refer to terror attacks. Sounds a lot like The Donald."
GETTY A new poll of French voters has Emmanuel Macron just ahead of rival Marine Le Pen
Published just over three weeks before the April 23 opening round, the Ifop-Fiducial poll for Paris Match, CNews and Sud Radio shows Mr Macron would garner 26 per cent of the vote in the election's first round. But Mrs Le Pen, the anti-Brussels leader of France's Front National party, is breathing down his neck and expected to garner 25.5 per cent of the vote.
Both presidential favourites hold a solid lead over conservative centre-right candidate François Fillon, who has dropped to below 20 per cent and is tipped to pick up no more than 17.5 per cent of the vote. The former frontrunner's popularity took a hit earlier this year after it was alleged his wife, Penelope, had been paid more than half a million euros for a ‘fake' job as his parliamentary assistant.
GETTY Macron is expected to face off against Le Pen in a May 7 poll
Both haves since been charged with a string of fraud-related charges, including embezzlement and abuse of public funds. Communist-backed Jean-Luc Mélenchon, for his part, is expected to garner 14.5 per cent of the vote in the first round. His closest rival, left-wing rebel Benoît Hamon, the official candidate for the Socialist party, would get 10 per cent of the vote the poll says.

Dog and Pony Brewlab began quietly pouring their beer exclusively at Union Local 613 at the beginning of May. A less quiet release party will coincide with the opening of Union's new patio mid-July.
Though the business is new, the three owners, John, Steve and Tristan are brewing-industry vets. The three met while working and brewing at Beyond the Pale brewing company (BTP). At one point, Steve was even a highly sought-after beer blogger. After perfecting their own recipes, the three savvy beer mavens were ready to take the big leap into the unknown. Partnering with Union, where Tristan was already bartending and leading beer tasting classes, was an obvious fit.
The brewery name, Dog and Pony Brewlab (DAP), inspires a light-hearted approach to this fun industry. Dog and Pony refer to the shenanigans the three would get into while working together at BTP. Brewlab is a nod to their desire to experiment with styles and flavours.
DAP wants to brew beer that they'd want to drink: “We enjoy beer that is light on superlatives and heavy on taste.” The brewers are excited to engage the beer-drinking community of Ottawa and encourage feedback: Be it through social media (@DogAndPonyBeer) or Untappd or directly through the Union 613 servers, they want to know what you like, or don't, about their beer. Steve puts it like this: “You don't have to like our beer just because we made it from the city you live in. Drink our beer if you enjoy how it tastes.”
They opened their offerings with a porter (such hipsters! Porter in the spring?!) followed by a Session IPA. Here are the provided tasting notes:
Buford T. Porter: Coming in at 6.5% with 40 IBU, the beer has an intense note of dark chocolate and roast coffee. Finishing dry and malty, the hops provide a near-imperceptible backbone of savoury and spicy, playing off the minute touch of smoke that also resides in the glass.
Jabroni Session IPA: Delivers a big nose of citrus, stone fruit, and soft malt on the back. Mouthfeel is solid considering the low alcohol (4.9%) and despite packing 60 IBU, it doesn't come across as overly bitter but rather balanced. Vermont Ale yeast was used and provides some peach and apricot aromatics. (Yes, this beer is named in honour of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson)
Dog & Pony Brewlab creations are available exclusively on draught at Union Local 613. Watch for the mid-June patio party and beer release event!
Speaking to broadband officials, Mayor Ed Murray reiterated his position that building out a municipal broadband would be too expensive for the city to pursue alone — and that a public-private partnership would work better.
The best way to expand Internet access in Seattle is through public-private partnerships, Mayor Ed Murray said at a regional broadband conference Monday.
The mayor reiterated the position he formed after a city-commissioned study released last summer showed it would cost between $480 million and $665 million to build out a municipal-broadband network across the city. That price tag is less than previously estimated, but the mayor said it was still too much to be feasible.
“When I came into office, I was very excited about the possibility of municipal broadband until the study came back and indicated it would be literally the largest tax increase in Seattle,” Murray said Monday at the conference, co-hosted by the nonprofit Next Century Cities and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The mayor's office later clarified that financing a municipal broadband system would result in one of the largest tax increases in the city. The $930 million Move Seattle transportation levy approved by voters last fall may be bigger, depending on the exact cost of municipal broadband.
Some residents and interest groups have long pushed for a city-run broadband network, saying it would be less expensive than services from private providers and would help reduce access inequality, known as “the digital divide.”
In Seattle, 93,000 homes — about 15 percent of the city's households — don't have access to the Internet. Many are occupied by people with low incomes, the mayor said.
A municipal network could help bridge that divide by offering high-speed, affordable Internet access across the city, said Devin Glaser, a policy analyst with Upgrade Seattle, which is working to muster support for a city-run network.
“We just passed a $930 million transportation levy for much-needed things, and the broadband package would be half the price of what was just passed,” Glaser said.
After the city study was released, Seattle launched the Digital Equity Initiative, which will be announcing “significant programs” in about a week, Murray said.
The city also partnered with Google to lend people Wi-Fi hot-spot devices through the Seattle Public Library, a program Murray said was popular on its first day.
Seattle works with various companies, including telecommunications giants CenturyLink and Comcast, to expand service across the city.
The city has said it is working to increase competition in the area, which has long been dominated by Century­Link and Comcast. Among other things, the city said it is getting rid of some regulatory barriers.
Glaser acknowledged that the city is making efforts to increase access, saying “all momentum is good.” But it's not enough, he said, to create a level playing field.
Murray hasn't totally ruled out the idea of a municipal broadband system.
“There may be strategies that would work. And that may be ultimately the best way to solve the issue of the divide,” he said Monday. “We're not going to be able to do it or a lot of things unless we see an aggressive approach by the federal government to work with local jurisdictions to make that possible.”
The federal government did finance about 230 broadband projects nationwide through the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Those funds are now spent, but municipalities can apply for smaller grants through other federal agencies, said Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information.
Strickling said Monday the federal government helps municipalities by providing guides to funding and other technical expertise. Each community needs to make its own choice about public versus private broadband, he said.
“We advocate that it is one of the options that ought to be available for communities,” he said of municipal broadband. “A community always has an ability to negotiate stronger (with private partners) when there are other options.”
Murray said the city will continue working on public-private partnerships, not just for infrastructure but also because “technology is changing so fast” and private companies can help create nimble business models.
This July 4th weekend how about taking some time to consider the names of those items you are about to eat? Brace yourself for the short and disputed history of that American grilling favorite: The “hot dog.”
Why do we call hot dogs, well, hot dogs?
There are a few schools of thought on the origin of this favorite food.
Some think that people commonly believed that the thin sausages contained dog meat. This particularly gruesome coinage started on American college campuses in the late 19th century, according to hot dog historian Bruce Kraig.
The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council suggests the phrase, in part, might have slightly more innocent inspiration. In the mid-19th century, German immigrant butchers in the United States began selling variations of sausages, some of which were thin and long, like the dog breed dachshund. They called these dachshund sausages. Over time, the phrase may have been bastardized into “hot dog.”
Frankfurter vs. wiener
Two other words for hot dogs — frankfurters and wieners — raise an unsettled debate about where the food originated. The former is named for Frankfurt, Germany; the latter, for Vienna, Austria (wiener is the German adjective that means “of Vienna). Even the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council says this argument is too hard to pin down.
Non-kosher hot dogs do not contain dog either. They have pork in them, whereas kosher hot dogs have no pork and are likely to contain beef, chicken, or turkey. (Fido's safe!).
The history of the hamburger
While you're out there at the grill, we might as well serve up some more food words!
The word “hamburger” also owes its origins to a German city — in this case, Hamburg. Food historians believe that around the same time sausage-makers were refining their meat products, cooks in Hamburg served up a cooked version of steak tartare. For awhile, the dish was known in English as “hamburger steak.”
If you're a vegetarian, fear not. We have a word to barbecue for you, too. Throw a tofu burger on the grill and keep this is mind: “tofu” comes from Chinese, by way of Japanese, meaning “rotten bean.”
This fall, Anthony Bourdain, acclaimed chef, author, and host of CNN's Parts Unknown, will release Appetites, his first cookbook since 2004's Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook. The celebrity chef and longtime TV personality who's built a career on his take-no-prisoners straight-shooting assessment of the food and restaurant industries, sat down with Nuvo's Joshua David Stein to talk about food, family, and, uh, fighting to stay in shape. Here are three essential things you need to know about Bourdain, the man and the living legend.
How Bourdain maintains his trim figure: If Anthony Bourdain seems intimidating on television, rest assured he could probably beat you up in real life. He dedicates time every single day to train in Brazillian jiu-jitsu and has earned himself a blue belt in the combat sport. "At one point, he raises his soft grey T-shirt to polish his reading glasses and reveals a torso that seems transplanted from a man half his age," Stein writes. "Those are some calendar-level abs." Bourdain explains his training regimen to Stein: "I train every day, wherever I am in the world. When I'm in New York, I train at the Renzo Gracie Academy, an hour private and then an hour and a half general population. That's basically Fight Club."
What he cooks for his family is different from what he cooks for the public. Appetites are filled with recipes that Bourdain cooks at home: "scrambled eggs, roast chicken with lemon and thyme, a turkey at Thanksgiving," Stein explains. Three decades of cooking professionally took Bourdain outside of his home kitchen—but now he's back. "As somebody who cooked professionally for 30 years, I only saw the normal world as dark silhouettes in the dining room. I was never home. I had no idea what people did on weekends on what it's like to have a family."
There are rules in Bourdain's kitchen. Rules about: "The third slice of bread in the club sandwich. The brioche bun on the hamburger. Toasting the muffin on only one side when you make eggs Benedict." According to Bourdain, "These are terrible food crimes." But just because he's strict when it comes to muffin-toasting doesn't mean he's completely unforgiving—"Everyone lies in cookbooks," Bourdain tells Nuvo. "That's why they're generally so frustrating. Nobody ever tells you, for instance, that you're going to screw up hollandaise. It's not gonna happen for you the first time. It takes professionals many repeated times."
President Trump's decision to provide weapons to the Syrian Kurds, who are fighting Isis, potentially marks a crucial change in the political geography of the Middle East. In effect, the US is choosing to support its Kurdish ally in Syria, in defiance of Turkey, whose aim is to prevent the establishment of a quasi-independent Kurdish state there.
Mr Trump approved a plan on Monday to arm the Kurds directly, in order to enable the People's Mobilisation Units (YPG) Kurdish militia and its Arab allies to assault and capture Raqqa, the de facto capital of Isis in Syria. The US will send heavy machine guns, anti-tank weapons, mortars, armoured cars and engineering equipment to bolster the attack.
Turkey has sought in vain to persuade the US to break its alliance with the Syrian Kurds, accusing the YPG of being the Syrian arm of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) that has been waging a guerrilla war against the Turkish state since 1984. “Both the PKK and the YPG are terrorist organisations and they are no different, apart from their names,” said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavasoglu on Tuesday. “Every weapon seized by them is a threat to Turkey.”
Mr Trump has always said that he gives priority to defeating Isis, leading him to agree to a long-delayed plan to capture Raqqa with ground forces led by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). This was said by a US official last December to have 45,000 fighters of whom 13,000 are Arabs and the rest Kurdish. It has defeated Isis repeatedly when backed by air strikes by the US-led air coalition ever since Isis besieged but failed to take the Kurdish city of Kobani in late 2014.
The US wants to inflict a double defeat on Isis by capturing both Raqqa and Mosul in Iraq over the next few months. Isis fighters are still holding out in the Old City of Mosul after a siege by Iraqi government forces that has lasted almost seven months. Most of the city has ready fallen with heavy casualties on all sides and severe destruction. The loss of Raqqa and Mosul will not be the end for Isis, which is reverting to being a guerrilla organisation, but the self-declared Caliphate will no longer exist as a state with an administration and extensive territory.
Raqqa, once a city of 300,000 people on the northern bank of the Euphrates River, is already isolated from the south bank by air strikes destroying bridges. The road south to Deir Ezzor, the biggest city in eastern Syria, has been cut by the SDF. Isis fighters can only move in and out of Raqqa by boat, though they have proved in Mosul that they are skilled in urban warfare using sniper teams, suicide bombers and booby traps to slow down and inflict losses on a more numerous and better armed enemy.
But the fate of Raqqa is not the only issue being decided in the fighting in northern Syria. Turkey is facing a disastrous outcome of the wars in Syria and Iraq which it once hoped would extend its influence in the northern Middle East. Since 2011, it has been seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad and to stop the two million Syrian Kurdish minority gaining control of a broad band of territory along Turkey's southern frontier.
Turkish efforts to stop the Kurdish advance have largely failed and the intervention of Turkish ground troops west of the Euphrates in August 2016 has only been a qualified success. Its local Arab and Turkman allies were unable to take the Isis stronghold of al-Bab without Turkish army intervention. Though Turkey has offered its services to the US as an ally capable of replacing the YPG in the battle against Isis, this always looked a dubious option. It has long been obvious that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is more interested in targeting the Kurds than in fighting Isis.
Turkey's response to the YPG and SDF successes has been to step up military engagement in northern Syria and to threaten much tougher action. On 25 April, Turkish planes launched air strikes against YPG positions killing 20 fighters, half of them women. Mr Erdoğan threatened that similar action might happen “at any time”. The US said the Turkish action was “unacceptable” and was so concerned about a Turkish ground invasion that it sent patrols of US special forces in vehicles to monitor the Syrian side of the border. For their part, the Syrian Kurdish leaders said they would not take Raqqa if Turkish military action continued.
The public decision by Mr Trump to send heavier weapons to the YPG is important primarily as a sign that the US is ignoring Turkish threats and will stick to its military alliance with the Syrian Kurds, which has served it well. This makes it difficult for the Turkish army and air force to escalate its attacks on the YPG.
Mr Erdoğan is to see Mr Trump for the first time in Washington on 16-17 May and will seek to persuade him to reverse his policy towards the Syrian Kurds, but he is unlikely to succeed. In his final days in office, President Obama had also decided to send heavier equipment to the YPG, indicating that the pro-Kurdish policy has broad support in the US. At the same time, the Americans are trying to reassure the Turks by saying that the new weapons will be only used against Isis and the quantity of ammunition delivered will be limited to what is needed for that operation. The Turks say they fear that the arms will be handed over to the PKK and used against their soldiers.
ORDER IT NOW
The Syrian Kurds are worried that, once Isis is defeated, the US will no longer need them and will revert to its old alliance with Turkey as a member of Nato and a major power. This would leave them vulnerable to a Turkish ground attack aimed at extinguishing their semi-independence. For now, however, the Kurds in Syria will be relieved that the US has decided to stick with them.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif arrives in Australia for a two-day visit on the last leg of his six-nation Asia-Pacific tour.
Zarif, who is the first high-ranking Iranian official visiting Australia in 10 years, is scheduled to hold talks with the country's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop and Minister for Trade and Investment Steven Michele Ciobo.
He will also meet the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international development and parliament speaker.
The visits are aimed at discussing ways for strengthening political and economic relations.
The Iranian minister will also deliver a speech at the Australian National University and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
He will further attend a meeting with the Iranian elites in Sydney and an interview with state-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
The top Iranian diplomat will wrap up his visit to Australia on Wednesday and set off for Tehran.
Zarif's meeting comes as the Australian foreign minister paid an official visit to Tehran in April, 2015 for the first time in some 12 years. She invited her Iranian counterpart to visit Australia.
On the fifth leg of his tour, Zarif paid a two-day visit to New Zealand and held talks with the country's senior officials including Prime Minister John Phillip Key and Foreign Minister Murray McCully.
The Iranian minister started his six-nation tour on March 6 and has also paid visits to Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei and Thailand.
World attention has focused this past week on the suicide in a jail cell of an Australian-Israeli who is alleged to have been a spy. The person and his deeds or misdeeds are not the subject of this article, but his suicide is.
To what extent Judaism condones suicide is both simple and complicated.
Simple, because life is given by God and only He has the right to take it away. The Jewish codes insist that the body belongs to the Almighty, and no-one is permitted to harm, jeopardize or destroy God's property. Genesis 9:5 says, “I will surely require an accounting for your life-blood”, and the sages say this includes a suicide (Bava Kamma 91b).
The Ten Commandments clearly prohibit murder. Rabbinic commentary extends the prohibition to say, in Maimonides' words, “He who kills himself is guilty of bloodshed” (Hilchot Avelut chapter 1).
Deuteronomy states (4:15), “You shall carefully guard your life”, which makes suicide a serious transgression.
Amongst the Biblical cases of actual or attempted suicide, a highly significant incident related in I Samuel 31:4 is that of King Saul falling on his sword when the Philistines were about to capture and kill him. One theory as to why the Tanach does not seem to condemn him is that a king of Israel is entitled to defend the dignity of the royal office. Another view is that as his death was imminent it was as if he were already dead, though not all the commentators believe that he did actually die at his own hand.
In later thinking, even acts of suicide in times of severe persecution were not whitewashed. The usual ceremonies performed for the dead were, according to Jewish law, not carried out for suicides, and it was customary to bury them in a side section of the cemetery (Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 345).
That is the theory, but in practice the issue is much more complicated. It is true that for a long period suicide was stigmatized as a brazen act of defiance of God, to be treated with visible disapproval.
But for many centuries the law has preferred not to apply a hard and fast rule but to delve more deeply into the suicide's motivation and mental situation; in most situations the person is regarded as having acted under such mental and emotional pressure that he/she is deemed not to have made a responsible decision.
The Aruch HaShulchan (Yoreh De'ah 345:5) states, “This is the general principle in connection with suicide: we find any excuse we can and say he acted thus because he was in terror or great pain, or his mind was unbalanced, or he imagined it was right to do what he did because he feared that if he lived he would commit a crime… It is extremely unlikely that a person would commit such an act of folly unless his mind were disturbed”.
It is interesting that Greece and Rome saw suicide as a crime. However, the Greeks gave the government the right to allow suicide in urgent cases; the Romans also saw suicide as a criminal act, particularly if it was meant to pre-empt legal punishment, but they applied the law with some leniency.
In Judaism the debate was not so much political or social, but theological. Suicide defeated God's purposes since He “created (the world) to be inhabited” (Isa. 45:18).
Life not only belonged to God but, as the first section of Genesis averred, it was good and had to be seen as such by every human being. Yet Job admitted (3:20-21) that “the bitter in soul… longs for death but it does not come”. Rashi asks, “Why does God give light to him that is in misery?” Amongst the rabbinic sages, Choni HaMe'aggel felt so lonely that he prayed to God to let him die, and God agreed (Ta'anit 23a).
Nonetheless there were times when a person was under such pressure that taking his own life was a way of averting a grave evil. The mass suicides at Masada and other acts of self-sacrifice may not have been authorised, but they were understood, and history calls them heroic and insists that they did not lose their place in the World to Come.
However, Ahitophel, who committed suicide, is listed by the Mishnah amongst those who have no share in the next world (Sanh.10:2).
A famous case involved Rabbi Chananiah ben Teradyon, whose death is recorded in the Talmud in Avodah Zarah 18a. When the Romans wrapped him in a Torah scroll and set fire to it, the rabbi's pupils urged him to open his mouth, inhale the fire and hasten his death. He replied, “He who put the soul in the body is the One to remove it; no human may destroy himself!”
Sometimes a person felt so guilty after doing (or believing he had done) a grave sin that he wanted to end his life, and some cases of suicide recorded in the Talmud arose out of circumstances of this kind. Others were so full of grief when a great man such as Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi died that they felt life was no longer worthwhile.
These circumstances explained the wish for suicide but Jewish teaching remained adamant that people should work through their problems and not abdicate by taking their own lives, and Rabbi Ishmael believed that public condemnation of the suicide was in order at the funeral, though Rabbi Akiva refused to go so far while still denying the suicide a eulogy and the full honours of interment (S'machot chapter 2).
The law arrived at the position that if a suicide, although still deemed a sin, could be understood as other than a deliberate act of defiance of the Creator, they were given the benefit of the doubt and the normal ceremonies were allowed.
The criterion therefore is whether the act arose out of defiance or distress. This is the all-important question in relation to the Ben Zygier case.
Pondering the suicide of Holocaust survivors, Elie Wiesel is said to have remarked, “Those who have looked at the ultimate darkness are no longer immune”. Is there not a philosophical difference, however, between the darkness that others perpetrate upon a person or people, as in the Holocaust, and the darkness and despair one somehow brings upon oneself?
There were suicides during the Holocaust (e.g. the 92 maidens who chose death rather than dishonour: an incident reminiscent of a Talmudic story in Gittin 57b), but it seems surprising that there were not more.
In Israel, the suicide rate is one of the lowest in the world, again a surprising figure.
In “The Echo of the Nazi Holocaust in Rabbinic Literature”, Rabbi HJ Zimmels writes of two opposing emotions amongst European Jews at the time of the Holocaust – pessimism and despair leading to suicide, and optimism and hope leading to a strong will to survive.
The same conflicting emotions grapple within the heart, soul and mind of the human being who is in dire straits whatever the details. Suicide is one way out, but there is another – slowly, painfully, bravely working one's way through the moment and holding on to life.
It has always been difficult and complex and in today's world it is probably worse, even for a person who is not enmeshed in the highly fraught espionage business. Problems of so many kinds confront us all, and often we can't get off their backs or get them off ours. Judaism believes in life and its sweetness, but it is easy to find oneself in the complex of emotions that Zimmels describes.
It's altogether too convenient to sit in judgement on others and to forget the advice of Pir'kei Avot, “Judge not your fellow until you stand in his place”.

Guardian
Iran's police chief admitted yesterday that protesters who were arrested after June's disputed presidential election had been tortured while in custody in a prison in south-west Tehran. But he denied that any of the detainees had died as a result. General Ismail Ahmadi Moghaddam said the head of the Kahrizak detention centre had been dismissed and jailed. “Three policemen who beat detainees have been jailed as well,” the official IRNA news agency quoted Moghaddam as saying. (Emphasis mine)
In fact, Iranians did die in prison and more are in danger of dying. Iranian citizens, some just children, were systematically arrested and tortured to extract confessions, which — as we are finally beginning to understand in America — is exactly the point of torture: to extract a confession. Any confession. It is a form of punishment, not interrogation.
Iran is entering a process of grief now. More details will get out, no matter how severe the government's control of media. They will spread by word-of-mouth if need be. With each new revelation, the Supreme Leader and his President take another blow to their legitimacy. The Green Revolution is not over; in fact, it has barely begun.
BOSTON -- Federal dollars being pumped into grant programs to spur students to enter IT careers in the health care industry should help to create between 45,000 and 50,000 jobs over the next five years, a top federal health official said on Thursday.
Speaking at the Health Information Technology (HIT) Conference here, Dr. David Blumenthal, National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, said a portion of $2 billion in discretionary spending under Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) is being targeted at education and training for electronic health record implementation.
A large part of the training is for people to staff 60 regional extension centers, which are public, private partnerships that will assist rural hospitals and physician practices with 10 or fewer doctors in rolling out electronic medical records (EMRs) and supporting technology.
"There's a shortage of workers who can staff these regional extension centers and provide the kind of support physicians and hospitals need to become meaningful users" [of EMRs], Blumenthal said.
Without specifying an amount, Blumenthal said the ONC has already handed out funding to 70 community colleges or other universities to create programs for workforce training for health information technology.
The HIT conference, hosted by the Massachusetts Health Data Consortium, focused not only how to create jobs in health information technology, but how that technology can reduce health costs while improving quality of care.
The ONC has released a 556-page draft rule that contains specifications and certification criteria for EMRs. Those rules, now available for public comment, set a four-year timeline beginning in 2011 for implementing the systems; they also spell out best practices.
A final version of the government's Notice of Proposed Rule Making helps define what type of technology should be used and spells out how $36 billion in incentives from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 should be paid out. A physician in private practice can receive up to $44,000 for rolling out EMRs and showing "meaningful use" of that technology.
Hospitals could potentially receive millions of dollars in reimbursement.
Physicians and hospitals that don't roll out the EMR technology and prove that they are making "meaningful use" of it by 2015 face penalties in the form of reduced Medicare reimbursements.
Blumenthal also said an advisory committee he formed to investigate reports from members of Congress and the press that EHRs had caused some "adverse events and patient injuries" reported back to him about three weeks ago. He said the committee recommended collecting more information and that the ONC further study safety problems associated with EHRs, "and make sure we proceed thoughtfully and carefully."
Blumenthal said nothing the committee found had given it any pause as to the trust that the government, including Congress, had in the ONC's policies surrounding the rollout of EHRs.
"There was no question that the introduction of electronic health systems improve patient safety. The issue was how do we introduce those systems in ways that are as safe as possible," Blumenthal said.
The ranking member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee has asked 31 hospitals and health-care systems to provide feedback on problems with computer systems associated with the government's efforts to incent the rollout of EHRs.
The government has uncovered prescription errors related to EHR systems that have been rolled out in private-sector hospitals. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), sent a letter in January to some of the nation's largest health care facilities asking for any information on "issues or concerns that have been raised by your health care providers" over the past two years.
When I was fresh out of college — before I spent my days poring over countless SEC filings and earnings transcripts — I wanted to do some basic good for the world. I was young, optimistic, and maybe a bit naive at the time.
Following graduation, I made the decision to leave the cushy confines of my hometown in middle-class Long Island to become a STEM teacher in Baltimore City — one of the most notoriously rough school districts in the United States.
I entered into a residency program that allowed me to begin teaching on my own almost immediately. Still wet behind the ears, I quickly found myself taking on one of the most challenging classroom environments in the country, right in the heart of Baltimore's Westside.
I remember being told by an administrator at one point, “Don't worry, this isn't going to be like The Wire," which, while deceptive, was technically not a lie. As it turns out, these schools can be much worse.
Aside from the ever-expanding cockroach population, a lack of classroom doors, and the simple fact that my school was completely surrounded by boarded-up buildings, I noticed one glaring problem with American education during my brief teaching career: Students aren't being taught skills relevant to the jobs that will be available to them in the future.
America's Greatest Investment
When someone asks me what the most important investment they can make is, the answer has always been what I call forward-looking education.
For financial investment purposes, this means learning everything you possibly can about emerging industries and the companies that make them up. For future job seekers, it means learning the skills these industries will inevitably demand.
Right now, this unfortunately isn't something the American education system is doing, and the effects could end up being economically devastating, both for current and future generations.
The Huffington Post recently highlighted this exact issue, pointing out that 90% of public schools in the U.S. aren't teaching any form of computer programming whatsoever.
Further, fewer students now engage in this field than 10 years ago, and only nine states recognize computer science as a math or science.
The economic result of this level of inaction is already apparent. The “skill-gap” so many employers have been pointing out recently is real. According to Manpower Group's “Talent Shortage Survey,” 39% of U.S. employers reported difficulty filling jobs due to lack of available talent last year.
The reason for this growing skill-gap is pretty obvious: There's a striking disconnection between educational direction and available jobs. The figure below should help make things a little more clear:

Now, I don't have to explain exactly why this could end up being detrimental on an economic level. Even if you're not a future job seeker (or raising one), you know how important a qualified workforce is to the economy long term.
The reality is that if we do not begin educating students with the future job market in mind, unemployment is bound to become a major problem — not only for job seekers but for American companies as well. After all, skilled employees are every company's greatest resource.
During his 2013 State of the Union, President Barack Obama said, "To grow our middle class, our citizens must have access to the education and training that today's jobs require."
He was wrong. To grow our middle class, our citizens actually need access to the education and training that tomorrow's jobs require.

The Jobs of Tomorrow
In a recent blog post, LinkedIn released its list of the 25 Hottest Skills of 2014. One quick look at the top 10, and it's clear how incredibly important technology education has become:
Yet despite the clear and growing importance of these skills, American public schools and students are stuck wasting precious time memorizing the periodic table, learning cursive, and performing long division, as if technology hasn't already made these skills completely obsolete.
Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed Huckleberry Finn just as much as anyone else. But does my ability to point out its theme and climax really make me a particularly productive citizen in today's economy? Of course not.
The cold, hard truth is that we're preparing younger generations for a world that simply doesn't exist anymore (or won't exist in the near future). Not only are the required skills becoming increasingly complex, but automation and robotics are taking over low-skill jobs at a pace once thought unimaginable.
According to research by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne at Oxford University, nearly 47% of total U.S. employment is considered “high risk,” meaning those jobs are likely to be automated within the next 10 to 20 years.
Some of these jobs include mathematical technicians, tax accountants, drivers, cashiers, and even lawyers.
Of course, new jobs will certainly be created in the process, but we won't be able to satisfy the demand if our workforce isn't properly trained. It helps when local governments follow through with initiatives, such as Chicago's mandatory coding curriculum, but ultimately this should be a mandate coming from the federal level.
If you're at all interested in advocating computer science education, be sure to check out code.org for information (you don't need to be a computer scientist to make a difference).
More importantly, though, if you have a future job seeker in your family, it might just be worth nudging them in the right direction. After all, it could easily be the single best investment they ever make.

The league-licensed sports video games that release annually — the Madden, FIFA, and NBA 2Ks of the world — are celebrated for their authenticity and complexity, but that also makes them incredibly difficult on players who are unfamiliar with them or the sports they represent.
Every year developers try to implement ways to make them more welcoming, easier to learn and easier improve at without hitting a wall of frustration, but that hasn't proven enough to draw in new consumers. With arcade-style games — which once acted as bridges to the simulation games — now largely extinct, there is little middle ground, leaving many feeling overwhelmed by the current state of sports games or simply disinterested in the genre because of it.
REVIEWS: 'Madden NFL 16' | 'NBA 2K16' | 'FIFA 16'
Where "Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" succeeds most is in its accessibility. It offers an enjoyable and easy-to-comprehend gameplay experience that will satisfy not only fans who are passionate about lacrosse but also those who may know very little about the sport.
Having lived on the West Coast my whole life, I went into the game without a great deal of knowledge of lacrosse. My exposure to the sport has been limited to the rare appearances on highlight shows and having briefly flipped across matches that were being broadcast on ESPN3. I knew what lacrosse looked like but wouldn't have necessarily been able to explain the rules or procedures behind it.
Unlike those other major sports games mentioned at the top of this review, "Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" is not intimidating even for someone new to the sport. In fact, it's very accommodating, and most importantly, fun even through the process of gaining an understanding of how to play.
There is no interactive tutorial in the video game, and lacking one has sunk some other sports games before. Surprisingly, it turns out to be unnecessary here. All one has to do is look over the controls and pay attention in-match to button prompts that appear above the players which act somewhat as a tutorial on their own.
The only issues I had as a newcomer were related to two rules which resulted in numerous penalties early on. One is offsides, which is explained in a loading screen but may not be spotted initially. The other relates to offensive players who enter the goalie crease. There's no explanation when this happens. A ref appears, makes a signal, and play resumes with the opposition in possession.
"Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" is the product of a 2014 crowdfunding campaign, from developers with considerable pedigree when it comes to lacrosse video games. That shows in the quality of game and the design decisions that have been made.
MORE: The full 'UFC 2' roster, revealed
The vision for the game was originally described as having “the player movement and passing of basketball with the stick control, shooting, and hitting of hockey to create a high scoring, action-packed lacrosse video game.” Crosse Studios and Big Ant Studios, who co-developed "Casey Powell Lacrosse 16," have achieved exactly what they sought out to do.
The gameplay does feel wide open and movement is fluid, there are some big hits, and most of the matches do feature a lot of goals being scored — all of which is realistic to the sport. Important to translating all that are the controls which are simple and responsive, with a few modifiers adding complexity when skills have improved enough to handle them. The only thing that doesn't feel completely natural is assigning sprint to the pressing down of the left stick on the controller.
"Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" ships with generic teams but the game has a brilliantly implemented community sharing system that allows for them to be switched out for real teams right out of the gate. Upon starting the game for the first time (this can also be done later), the user is presented with the option of downloading the top-rated community file. After that is done, 67 real college teams and all nine Major League Lacrosse teams are available, though they won't have their real logos.
While it would not be completely fair to compare the level of content offered in an independently developed game to those from massive publishers with near unlimited resources, ultimately consumers have to make spending decisions based in part on the content included and the longevity a product offers. This is where "Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" comes up a little short.
There's actually more than one might expect to be in the game and that helps to justify the $50 pricetag. The modes included are Single Games (exhibitions), Career (as coach or player), Online (quick or custom matches), Competitions (custom season and tournaments), and Lacrosse Academy (create, edit and share teams, players, coaches and officials).
MORE: How to move the Rams to LA in 'Madden NFL 16'
Career Mode, and potentially Online, will be where users wind up investing the majority of the time with the game. Like many other sports games, Career lets you play as either the Coach or a Player. With the former, the whole team is controlled and activities like player acquisitions and drafts take place. The latter involves playing as just one individual, though you can choose to control the whole team there also, with the goal of performing well and earning attribute boosts.
The basic expectations of a career mode are all met but that's pretty much all there is to it, and it brings into question whether Career will be compelling enough to hold interest beyond a few weeks of playing. Online has simple quick games through matchmaking and custom ones that allow for particular settings to be selected. In limited opportunities to play online thus far, it ran smoothly, though some sync issues were present.
Visually, the game looks great. It's evident that a lot of work went into the lighting for both day and night games. The player models and stadiums are also excellent. There are some collision detection issues, with players and sticks occasionally clipping right through others, but those instances don't really detract from enjoyment of the game. A weaker aspect is the presentation, as there is only one pregame and one postgame sequence, but the commentary is adequate.
The sports gaming genre has contracted to the point where creative entries in the space or those representing sports with smaller followings are few and far between. "Super Mega Baseball" and "Rocket League" have recently emerged as winners in filling that void, though the cost of entry with them was much less than the $50 it is here. That has to be considered for how widely it will be adopted and whether word of mouth will build to where the game captures more than just core lacrosse fans. Still, as the first sports game for consoles/PC to release this year, "Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" is a pleasant surprise and may be the next to be considered in that same class of alternatives to the traditional league-licensed sports games.
"Casey Powell Lacrosse 16" was reviewed on PC and is also available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. A download code was provided by the publisher for the purpose of review.

Ticktum, who returned to competitive racing in 2016 after serving a one-year ban, will race in Chennai alongside his Red Bull counterpart Verhagen.
Both drivers will get valuable track experience ahead of their 2017 campaigns in Formula Renault, where Ticktum will race for Arden while Verhagen teams up with MP Motorsport.
In the title-deciding MRF weekend, Joey Mawson will be out to capture the title, as the Australian leads the standings with 211 points to his name after three rounds.
The 2016 German F4 champion is chased by Harrison Newey, who sits 27 points away from Mawson, while Mick Schumacher is third, a further 11 points behind.
Both Newey and Schumacher took podium finishes at Chennai last year, and are familiar with the 3.717km track - unlike Mawson, who will have to come to grips with the circuit.
Behind, Brazil's Felipe Drugovich has Estonian Ralf Aron on his tail with 15 points between the two, the latter still in the hunt for a top-four finish despite missing a round.
Meanwhile, joining Ticktum and Verhagen this weekend will be reigning Formula 4 South East Asia champion, Presley Martono, who missed the last round due to visa issues.
Round 4 entry list:
Paul Hudson has had an excellent first year as Sandringham coach.
ST KILDA development coach and Sandringham senior coach Paul Hudson has been named the VFL's coach of the year.
The 45-year-old, who played for Hawthorn, Richmond and the Western Bulldogs, oversaw a successful home and away season in which the Zebras finished second on the ladder with 14 wins and four losses.
It was his first season as Sandringham's senior coach after taking over from academy manager Simon McPhee last October.
Hudson said he was honoured to receive the accolade but remained focused on bouncing back from a loss against Williamstown on the weekend.
"I'm obviously very humbled because there are so many quality coaches in the VFL," Hudson told SAINTS.com.au.
"Individual awards are nice but it won't change my focus from this week's semi final against Collingwood. We haven't been starting well recently so it's very important we come out hard against the Magpies.
"It's nice to be acknowledged for the amount of the amount of work and effort the other coaches put in. We're a coaching team. I am really appreciative of the players and the effort they put in. I'd like to thanks the players for the way they've gone about it with the alignment."
Meanwhile, former Saint Clinton Jones finished equal second in the JJ Liston Medal after polling three votes in the final round. He was tied with ex-teammate and current Williamstown forward Sam Dunell, Richmond midfielder Matt Thomas, and North Ballarat player Myles Sewell.
Saints pair Darren Minchington and Ahmed Saad also polled strongly, while Sandringham utility Mitch Brown was named at centre-half-forward in the team of the year, alongside Jones who was named in the centre.
JJ Liston Medal leaderboard:
Nick Rippon (North Ballarat) 15; Matt Thomas (Richmond) 14; Myles Sewell (North Ballarat) 14; Clint Jones (Sandringham) 14; Sam Dunell (Williamstown) 14; Ben Jolley (Williamstown) 13; Jonathan Simpkin (Box Hill Hawks) 13; Daniel Currie (Werribee) 11; Sam Iles (Box Hill Hawks) 11.
Image caption Louis came to the rescue of his disabled owner, Victoria Shaw, when she fell when getting out of the shower
A dog has been branded a hero after he raised the alarm when his disabled owner collapsed.
Louis, a nine-year-old Yorkshire terrier, pressed the panic button belonging to Victoria Shaw, 58, when she fell getting out of the shower.
Mrs Shaw, who suffers from glaucoma and arthritis, said she had shown Louis how to press the button in the past.
Wrexham Council's Telecare workers alerted paramedics, who rushed to the house to find Louis barking for help.
He was right beside me, right in my face, he wouldn't leave me Victoria Shaw, Owner of Louis
"He's just a pet but I've been training him to hit the button just in case, but it's always been just a bit of a game," said Mrs Shaw, who has owned Louis for two years.
"This is the first time he's done it for real."
'Right beside me'
Mrs Shaw, from Rhosymedre, Wrexham, twisted her leg and passed out after bumping her head during the accident on Sunday.
She broke her glasses during the fall and is unable to see well without them due to her eye condition.
Louis reacted when he saw his owner in difficulty and sounded one of the emergency panic buttons in the house.
Image caption Victoria Shaw showed Louis how to press the panic alarm in the past when she was playing with him
When Chester Telecare workers asked who sounded the alarm, his proud owner replied "it must have been Louis."
"He must have thought 'this is not a game this is for real', and hit the panic button," added Mrs Shaw.
"He was right beside me, right in my face, he wouldn't leave me.
"He's not only my best friend and companion, but my soul mate. I can't bear to be without him because of the things that he does for me."
The delay in getting a new contract extension done for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is due in part to the issue of the player protests during the playing of the national anthem, reports ESPN.com's Adam Schefter.
According to the report, the deal is already on the table and is expected to be signed, but getting the deal done has been slowed by other issues the league is dealing with, mainly the anthem protests.
Sports Business Journal had reported in August that the 58–year-old Goodell was close to receiving another contract extension.
But the new ESPN report says that during the owner's meeting last week in New York, the competition committee spent less than half an hour discussing the topic.
Goodell's current contract ends in 2019 and his new deal will extend him until the year 2024.
The new deal is expected to be similar to his past deal with compensation exceeding $30 million.
Goodell made $44 million in the 2013–14 fiscal year and $34 million the next year. His salary and bonuses do not have to be reported anymore as the NFL dropped from being a tax-exempt, not-for-profit company in 2015.
Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan is indefinitely suspending its Picadilly mine operation near Sussex, N.B.
The move is expected to result in the loss of 420 to 430 jobs.
Mark Fracchia, the president of PCS Potash and a former general manager for the New Brunswick mine, told a news conference that the decision to suspend operations at the mine was "extremely difficult."
"This is just a very sad day for all of us. Most of all to the people who have given us so many years of loyal service, for the community of Sussex, for the province generally and certainly for all of us at PotashCorp," Fracchia told reporters.
"We had high hopes for Picadilly and my heart goes out to all the people who have worked so very hard for so long in building and operating the mine."
The executive said the New Brunswick mine was the most expensive of its operations because of the geology in the province.
He said the decision had more to do with global market forces and he said there was little the provincial government could have done to help the corporation.
Sussex Mayor Marc Thorne said he was in "disbelief" when he heard about the corporation's decision to suspend mine operations.
"It is just heartbreaking to hear this news today," Thorne said.
The mayor said he's unsure how the community will fill the economic hole.
All our high-paying jobs in the community are gone as of this morning. - Deon Alcock , contractor in Sussex
"The jobs have been well-paying jobs and quite frankly I don't see how they can be replaced," he said.
Deon Alcock, an independent contractor worker in the area, said the news took people in the area by surprise.
"All our high-paying jobs in the community are gone as of this morning," he said.
"I think they are in the same boat as everybody else. They are surprised and thinking about other alternatives. But right now as we sit, there aren't many alternatives for anything in New Brunswick or Alberta."
Sussex residents react to news that PotashCorp is suspending its New Brunswick operations 2:02
'Devastating' impact on Sussex
Progressive Conservative MLA Bruce Northrup, who represents the communities surrounding the potash mine, said the news is "devastating" for the region.
"The local economy depends upon it, whether it is car dealerships, or Tim Hortons or shopping at the mall. It is definitely going to affect the area for sure," Northrup said on Tuesday.
The company said a core crew of about 35 will be kept on at Picadilly for care and maintenance of the operation.
Sussex Mayor Marc Thorne said PotashCorp.'s decision to suspend operations at the local mine is 'heartbreaking.' (CBC) The local MLA said he hopes if the potash market rebounds, the mine could reopen.
Northrup used the suspension of operations at the potash mine to take a shot at the moratorium of shale gas that was imposed by Premier Brian Gallant's government.
"The Liberals, the four years we were in government, they said we put all our eggs into one basket. There are no eggs in the basket there right now. The eggs are all gone," he said.
"They mismanaged the energy and resource sector to the point where there are no eggs in the basket. I'm demanding that Premier Gallant and the energy minister get involved in this directly and at least give them ... a secure source of natural gas for the potash mine."
PotashCorp's Fracchia said the shale gas moratorium "really had no bearing" on the decision.
New Brunswick MP Dominic LeBlanc said the federal government must step up to help the hundreds of laid-off workers at the potash mine.
"We are certainly open to finding the best way quickly to help these workers. Our government is committed to an agenda of aggressive economic development and investing in all kinds of things that will create jobs," LeBlanc said.
"It is exactly this kind of time where the people of New Brunswick should see the government of Canada suit up and step up to help and that is exactly what we're going to do."
The federal cabinet minister said there are no easy replacements for the high wages and long-term employment that the mine offered.
LeBlanc said the short-term measures may be limited to providing employment insurance and helping with training.

Capital savings for Potash
The company said more than 100 open positions in its Saskatchewan operations will be available to New Brunswick employees, along with relocation assistance.
The company said the suspension of its New Brunswick operation will allow it to:
Improve production at lower-cost operations.
Save money on capital expenditures.
Maintain long-term flexibility.
Preserve company jobs over the long term.
"We expect to increase our competitiveness and reduce cost of goods sold by $40 [million]-$50 million, which will be offset by severance and transition costs.
PotashCorp says the suspension will also eliminate $50 million in capital spending this year and another $135 million in 2017-18.
The company's international customers who were historically served by the New Brunswick operation will now be served from Saskatchewan through Canpotex.
PotashCorp's storage and loading facilities at the port in Saint John will be made available to Canpotex.
The annual cost of care and maintenance at the Picadilly mine is estimated at $20 million in 2016 and $15 million in subsequent years.
The company said if it ever decides to resume production in New Brunswick, it will take about one year to get the mine back in operation.
New Brunswick employees who do not remain at Picadilly or choose not to relocate to Saskatchewan will be given severance and assistance packages.
PotashCorp said it will establish a $5-million fund to:
Perna Studios is very excited to announce our very first trading card set entitled Classic Mythology. This set will focus on 6 timeless Classic Mythologies that we have all come to love and enjoy during our lifetime. The mythologies spotlighted in this set are Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Celtic, Japanese and Hindu. We have an impressive list of artists involved on this set working on both base/promo cards and sketch cards. Set scheduled to be released in early Spring 2012.PLEASE, NEGATIVE CRITIQUES ARE NOT WELCOME. THESE ARE ARTISTS INTREPRETATIONS. DESCRIPTIONS ARE BASED ON VARIOUS STORIES THAT ALL DIFFER FROM VARIOUS SOURCES. THANK YOU.This awesome sketch art card of Medusa from Greek Mythology is drawn by the very talented artist Soni Alcorn-Hender for our Classic Mythology trading card set.Medusa – Greek Mythology –Medusa was one of 3 Gorgon sisters, a chthonic monster, and a daughter of Phorcys and Ceto. Medusa was originally a ravishingly beautiful maiden, "the jealous aspiration of many suitors," priestess in Athena's temple, but when she and the "Lord of the Sea" Poseidon were caught together (against her will) in Athena's temple, the enraged Athena transformed Medusa's beautiful hair to serpents and made her face so terrible to behold that the mere sight of it would turn onlookers to stone. She was beheaded by the hero Perseus, who thereafter used her head as a weapon until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield.
The Australian Education Union has called on the federal government to include an emergency $175 million ''equity package'' in this year's budget to pay for national literacy and numeracy programs due to expire on June 30.
In its pre-budget submission, the union urged the government to introduce the interim package to stop the programs, which target the most vulnerable students in 1100 schools, disappearing.

Seventy per cent of those are public schools, which educate the lion's share of disabled, disadvantaged and low socio-economic status students.
The $540 million National Partnership payments for literacy and numeracy programs were launched at the 2008-09 budget, with the aim of improving literacy and numeracy results for all students, particularly low-income and Aboriginal children.
The third largest economy in the world, Japan's growth rate has shrunk to its lowest point in five years. This comes at a time when the Prime Minister of the country, Shinzo Abe, is looking for ways to direct the economy in the aftermath of the hike in sales tax.
The country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has shrunk at an annualized rate of 7.1 percentage points in the last three months from June. The Cabinet office released these numbers in Tokyo. An independent survey conducted through a group of 25 economists has found a similar percentage drop of seven points.
Tax hike blow
Sales tax was increased in April of this year and its lasting effects have spilled over into this quarter, as well. The worst hit sectors through June was household spending and retail sales. The Government hinted last week that it was willing to help boost stimulus so that it can weather further increase in the taxes charged, planned for October next year. Minoru Nogimori, economist—Nomura Securities of Tokyo said that it has become increasingly difficult to predict whether or not Prime Minister Abe will go to ten percent with the tax, and the decision will not be easy as the state of the economy at present is not in a favorable position.
Index of shares on The Topix grew 0.2 percent and the Yen (JPY) rose 0.1 percent, reaching 105.02 for every dollar (USD).
Investments down
Capital Investment of most companies has dropped over five percent when compared to the last quarter; this is nearly double the initial expectations that estimated only a decline of 2.5 %. Consumption, on the other hand, was noted to have declined by a similar amount, totaling 5.1, exceeding the initial value reading of 5%.
Large corporations including Honda Motor Co. (NYSE: HMC), Japan's third largest in the automobile sector, have made plans to cut the capital outlays by nearly 10% by the end of the fiscal year. DOCOMO Inc., the largest telecommunications provider in the country, has declared that they expect a drop of spending by nearly 2%. This economic weakness quickly followed a surge of spending and retail sales that happened early this year before the increased sales tax took effect. There was a rush that saw both companies and individual customers purchasing before the taxes were enforced in the end of March.

La Presse Jeunes et vieux, hétérosexuels ou fiers membres LGBTQ+, Montréalais et touristes : plus de 300 000 marcheurs ont célébré dimanche après-midi la diversité sexuelle dans une grande marée arc-en-ciel.
«Tout s'est très bien déroulé, il a fait beau et les messages politiques ont passé. Il y a eu un bel équilibre entre revendications et célébrations», s'est réjoui Jean-Sébastien Boudreault, vice-président de Fierté Montréal, à la fin de la marche. Jamais la métropole n'avait été l'hôte d'un si important défilé, point d'orgue d'une Fierté Montréal rehaussée à l'occasion de son 375e anniversaire. «Tout le monde nous dit que c'était le plus beau et le plus gros», exulte M. Boudreault. En outre, jamais le dispositif sécuritaire n'avait été aussi imposant lors d'un tel événement, quelques jours après les attentats au camion-bélier qui ont secoué la Catalogne. À 13h30, le boulevard René-Lévesque s'est figé et s'est tu pour les victimes d'homophobie, de transphobie et du VIH. Spectateurs et marcheurs ont brandi le poing en l'air lors de cet émouvant geste de solidarité, conclu par une salve d'applaudissements, sinon d'espoir. «J'ai tendu l'oreille le plus loin possible, et je n'entendais que des oiseaux», relate le vice-président de Fierté Montréal.

De part et d'autre du cortège de 3,2 kilomètres, la présence accrue des policiers et des agents de sécurité privés, sollicités pour la toute première fois, était palpable. Ceux-ci devaient non seulement veiller à la sécurité de la foule, mais aussi à celle - autre fait inédit - d'un premier ministre étranger, soit le taoiseach d'Irlande Leo Varadkar. «C'est une merveilleuse célébration de l'inclusion, de la tolérance et de la diversité», avait-il affirmé dans un français approximatif plus tôt en conférence de presse. Le dirigeant irlandais est apparu avec son conjoint au côté du premier ministre du Canada Justin Trudeau et du maire de Montréal Denis Coderre, qui avait présenté ses excuses vendredi dernier à la communauté LGTBQ+ pour les discriminations et les violences subies entre les années 1960 et les années 1970. Le trajet du défilé, dans une visée symbolique, faisait d'ailleurs le pont entre l'ancien village gai de l'ouest de l'île et l'actuel village. Le premier ministre du Québec Philippe Couillard et le chef du Parti québécois Jean-François Lisée ont aussi participé à la marche. Ouverture et revendications Précédé d'un camion du Groupe tactique d'intervention, d'un char du commanditaire Pfizer et ses ballons géants, puis d'un autre où s'élevait un inukshuk pour souligner l'apport des peuples autochtones, le défilé s'allongeait sur plusieurs kilomètres.

While the majority of the world rested easy after the intellegence assessment revealing that Iran had no nuclear weapons, nor had any plans of making them for more than 5 years, and many thinking an attack is far off into the future, it is my belief that the war had already started with a sale pending sign on it for the American people.
Reporting from Tehran on April 4, Reuters quotes Mohsen Hakim, whose father, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leads the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council, an ally of the Maliki US puppet government in Iraq: “Tehran, by using its positive influence on the Iraqi nation, paved the way for the return of peace to Iraq and the new situation is the result of Iran's efforts.”
However as thanks for the effort, Bush is on the brink of going Strangelove and has already made specific preparations and taking initial actions for the attack on Iran. Naval activities had been building over the past four years, and according to Russian sources the United States and NATO has been quite ready to ransack Iran for some a while now, as opposed to misdated info which implied the build up was still in progress.
The invasion of Iran has already begun with a broken cease fire with major Shia militias in Iraq, attempting to root out and destroy the base of support for Iran, and the widespread and mysterious infection of wheat, a major staple in food supply in Iran, which some are attributing to possible biological attack.
The consequences of this pending attack, which is rumored to be a nuclear one, are beyond any reasonable comprehension. Iranian ties with the likes of nuclear states such as Russia is particularly concerning, since the new Cold War basically began with the announcement of the defense missile shield by President Bush years ago and has become especially chilly with the U.S. insistence and backing of former Soviet states joining NATO and offering to warehouse such a system within its borders. United States executive officials have warned Russia to remain neutral in the ordeal, however I find it hard to believe that Bush is looking for anything but a fight with the former (and I use that phrase lightly) communist country. Well, it's a proven fact that fascists and communists don't get along very well.
The plan to attack Iran has been a likely goal of the Bush administration for some time. With the framing of Afghanistan and Iraq on the pretext of going to war with them and build a military presence within the two countries, the Untied States has a perfect launching point against Iran, which resides directly in between. Iran, is quite literally, a sitting duck and is perfectly surrounded from all angles.
The only real question is exactly how is he going to sell this to the American public, if not the world? Hitler made a case of invading Poland by dressing German political prisoners in full Polish army gear and shooting them just shy of a German military base near the Germany/Poland border, claiming invasion. Considering the Reichstag-like procedure following the 9-11 tragedies, I wouldn't put it past Bush to try something of the same magnitude. Already false claims of Iranian threats against U.S. navy ships and obviously false claims of green zone attacks by Iran (honestly, why would anybody with a gun to their head rush in just to provoke the one holding the gun?) by general Patraeus have been thrown about by the American media as absolute propaganda.
In short, an Iranian War is eminent, and despite what many experts might say, I am convinced that a full launch will occur before Bush leaves office, or even before the general election. Many rumors have floated around as an attack coming as soon as this month, however that is yet to be seen. This attack will set off one hell of a powder keg and will result in a full fledged World War between the west and the east. China has the ace card against the United States, trillions of U.S. dollars and treasuries in reserve which could be used to collapse the U.S. economy almost immediately into Wiemar status, though it is questionable whether or not they will use the card with the very intricate trade ties the country has to the United States.
How it will all pan out has yet to be seen, though given the absolute criminality and evident insanity of the Bush Administration, as well as its obvious disenchantment with any living thing on the planet that isn't an elitist, speak volumes of the likelihood that a war with Iran is unavoidable.

Indeed, the new section of track in DuPont, Wash., near where the Cascades train derailed on Monday, was an old freight line that had been revamped for passenger trains and named the Point Defiance Bypass. Investigators from the N.T.S.B. have not determined what caused the crash or if positive train control had prevented it. But they said the train was going 80 miles an hour into a curve with a limit of 30 miles an hour, and that, although equipment for the automatic-braking system was in place, it was not yet in use.
On Wednesday, the Pierce County medical examiner's office identified the third victim of the crash as Benjamin Gran, 40, of Auburn, Wash.
Richard Anderson, co-chief executive of Amtrak, said on Wednesday that the crash was “a wake-up call” and that Amtrak was determined to operate “the safest railroad in the world.”
Installing the safety technology is only one challenge. The system requires operators of trains to be able to communicate instantly and continually with rail company back offices. Those must be connected with the track's owners so that real-time information about track conditions and switches — or curves requiring a slowdown — can be fed into the system that automatically slows or stop a train as conditions change. And as in many other parts of the nation's train system, different entities own different pieces. If all three of the components are not harnessed together and working, then none of it works.
The track used by Amtrak between Tacoma and DuPont, for example, is owned by Sound Transit, a regional transportation agency that serves the Seattle metro area. Rachelle Cunningham, a spokeswoman for Sound Transit, said the agency was on schedule to have positive train control installed by the middle of next year. The BNSF Railroad owns most of the rest of the track in the corridor, Ms. Cunningham said, until the Oregon border, at which point, she said, it becomes Union Pacific's. When asked why the technology was not added in time for the maiden voyage, Sound Transit referred questions to Amtrak and Washington State's Department of Transportation. Amtrak earlier this week referred questions on the technology to Sound Transit.
Ms. Cunningham said Sound Transit was only responsible for the track components on a part of the system, while Amtrak and other companies were responsible for the equipment on trains, the radio towers and control center.
As they lobbied against the initial deadline in 2015, the railroad industry complained that the date had been set arbitrarily, without studying how long it would take to develop the systems, secure permits and put the projects to public bids. One of the most expensive aspects of the technology is the need to acquire wireless spectrum over which information about train movement can be transmitted.
An Arizona mother of four has been banned from eight McDonald's restaurants where she repeatedly swabbed play areas for bacteria in a personal crusade for better cleanliness, various news organizations report.
Monday, Erin Carr-Jordan, 36, of Chandler, Ariz., received a hand-delivered letter informing her that she is prohibited from setting foot in eight McDonald's restaurants in Gilbert, Chandler and Phoenix and that she will be charged with criminal trespass if she does, The Arizona Republic reports.
"It doesn't mean much to me personally," Carr-Jordan told ABC News. "I've gotten positive responses from parents who said, 'Hey, I'm not banned. Give me swabs.' "
Carr-Jordan tells the Republic that she believes the incident that set off the ire from McDonald's was one that took place at a Gilbert, Ariz., restaurant, where she found MRSA in the restaurant's PlayPlace and informed the manager as well as customers with children. When she saw one child licking the equipment, she demanded the restaurant close down the play area.
"I can't imagine knowing there was MRSA and not doing anything," Carr-Jordan tells the Republic. "I make no apologies for what I did."
All of the locations where Carr-Jordan is banned are owned by Ernie Adair, Carr-Jordan says, and he could not be reached by ABC News. The Republic says the letter was drafted by Phoenix lawyer James Stipe, who declined to name his client.
Dayna Proud, a McDonald's spokeswoman in Illinois, told the Republic the corporation remains "committed" to communicating with Carr-Jordan to address her concerns but recent actions by Carr-Jordan "have become disruptive to the employees and customers within our franchise's restaurants." Proud said, "We remain committed to working with an internal team on ensuring that our PlayPlaces are clean and safe for all customers."
Carr-Jordan's campaign, which covers six states, began in earnest after she had grime samples tested that she'd collected from a play area at a McDonald's in Tempe, Ariz., and discovered they contained pathogens found in fecal material and mucus, the Republic reports.
Young women — and young men, too — should listen when Sheryl Sandberg encourages them to lean in. Some people dislike her advice, but I think she's just tellin' it like it is. Not like it has to be, or like I would want it to be, mind you. But, yes, how it is.
Her goal is to affect the behavior of individual women so that they can succeed as employees in contemporary companies. Others have a complementary goal, namely trying to change the system that the next generation will go into.
Fix the women
Self-promotion is one component of career advancement that men and women approach differently. ‘Leaning in' is a fix the women approach to reducing this behavior gap between the sexes. But there are ways to level the field by changing the system, too.
To increase the number of women on their faculty, Delft decided to hire the 10 best women researchers they could find in a wide-open search.
That was the thinking at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, when they saw their efforts to recruit more women faculty members flounder. Their attempts at mild interventions — such as a requirement to hire a woman whenever there was a qualified female applicant — didn't work well enough. Earth scientist Elisabeth Kosters describes what can happen when a committee tries to handle a soft requirement like they had in Delft.
Fix the system
To increase the number of women on their faculty, Delft decided to hire the 10 best women researchers they could find in a wide-open search. Applicants could be at any stage of their careers and in any field of research covered by the institution. In addition to an academic position, these new employees would get favorable conditions to push their research projects forward after the move.
Crucially, the program was open only to women. Men were not eligible. The rector of the university, Karel Luyben, describes the program in a short video. Needless to say, it was challenged legally, but ultimately, the university was able to move ahead with their plans, and they are currently working to hire 10 more women this year.
The Delft program, which deserves discussion in many contexts, offers an amusing example of gender-based differences for self-promotion; it shows that men sometimes lean in so far they fall on their faces.
The 60% rule — when men apply for jobs
There are many anecdotes about men applying for jobs when they only meet a few of the requirements. Some reports actually quantify this.
Internal research at HP showed that women apply for open jobs only if they think they meet 100 percent of the criteria listed, whereas men respond to the posting if they feel they meet 60 percent of the requirements.
And this is the funny thing about the Delft experience. The university leadership identified a need — more women faculty. They developed a plan — only hire women. And it worked: they succeeded at hiring 10 excellent new colleagues.
But along the way, apparently adopting the 60% rule and flagrantly flouting the absolute gender requirement, 30 men applied, too.
You work hard. You pay taxes. But 26 corporations don't — or at least they didn't between 2008 and 2011. General Electric, Boeing and Verizon were among the major companies that together enjoyed more than $78 billion in tax subsidies over the last four years, according to a report by Citizens for Tax Justice.
In 2011, 30 corporations paid an average federal income tax of 7.1 percent — far less than the statutory 35 percent federal corporate tax rate.
Over the four-year period, Wells Fargo managed to avoid paying $21.6 billion, General Electric $10.6 billion, Verizon $7.7 billion and Boeing $6 billion.
Bob McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, connected widespread corporate tax evasion to America's budget problems and the government's inability to fund badly needed public works projects.
“Getting rid of corporate tax subsidies that cause such widespread tax avoidance ought to be a key part of any deficit-reduction program,” McIntyre says. “As a bonus, revenue-raising corporate tax reform would make it much easier to fund the investments we need to improve education and repair our crumbling roads and bridges — things that would actually help businesses and our economy grow.”

We waited a long time for new MacBook Pros but it seems all is not well with Apple's latest and greatest laptops - some of the users who've picked up the machines are having trouble with the trackpad, according to Apple sites MacRumors and 9to5Mac .
Specifically it's the classic three-finger-drag gesture - which moves the active window on screen - that people are having problems with. Users are reporting that the feature only works intermittently or doesn't work at all.
Read more: Chuwi LapBook SE
Apparently it's the edges or the corners of the Force Touch trackpad where the issue is most noticeable, and that's led some to speculate that the palm rejection feature (designed to ignore touches from your palm) is getting i the way.
You may want to hold out for the Surface Book 2
What a drag
"With the 13-inch MacBook Pro, I switched to three finger drag, and the palm rejection kind of gets in the way," wrote one user on the MacRumors forums. "If you go from typing to try and drag a window, you have to hit the centre of the trackpad with your finger tips, or it doesn't register."
There's been no official comment so far from Apple, although a user post on the Apple support forums suggests the company has "acknowledged" this is an issue and is promising a fix. It sounds like the sort of bug that can be cleared up with a software update rather than a mass trackpad recall.
In the meantime, if you're having problems with the three-finger-drag gesture on your new MacBook Pro, know that you're not alone. In the meantime, we've got some first impressions of Apple's newest laptop.
The Cleveland Indians are on their biggest national stage since their last visit to the ALCS in 2007, and the franchise is celebrating by rubbing its racism in the faces of every person tuning in to watch baseball at the peak of its season. It's a very strange thing.
The Indians have chosen to wear their Chief Wahoo caps, which depict a widely-derided racist caricature, in each of the five games they've played in the postseason thus far. This is even more ridiculous than it appears at first, because in April of this year—the beginning of the baseball season—Indians owner Paul Dolan said the team would move away from using the demeaning depiction of a supposed Native American, instead making the block-letter “C” the team's primary logo. I'm not sure what definition of “secondary” the Indians are using, but centering the team's visual identity around Chief Wahoo by using him on the team's main postseason cap doesn't fit any definition I'm aware of.
When Dolan first said the team was moving away from using the Wahoo logo, he said the team had “no plans to get rid of Chief Wahoo, it is part of our history and legacy.” Here we are in October, though, and despite claims that Chief Wahoo is no longer at the forefront of the team's image, it's very easy to look at the team's uniforms and see he is. The Indians aren't changing shit, and they should just say as much.
The Indians can't deny that the depiction of Chief Wahoo fosters disrespect of Native Americans—in fact, their claim that they would deemphasize the logo tacitly acknowledged as much. This isn't an abstract thing; you can see it at their park, where Indians fans show up to games in redface and headdresses. Would any MLB team let in a large group of fans who showed up in blackface, thrusting their Stubhub QRC codes at the ticket-takers? Probably not; the Indians, though, hardly have the moral high ground when they're selling redface imagery at shops and kiosks all over the park.

This is a function of a vastly larger problem, which is that racism against Native Americans is just not viewed with the same seriousness as other kinds of racism in America. It's embarrassing, and it's even more embarrassing that it's necessary to convince many Americans that racism against Native Americans is real. We as a country have been taught highly revisionist histories, but the uncomfortable truth is that the founding and expansion of the country were the outcome of acts of genocide, erased largely by disenfranchising and dehumanizing the victims. Wahoo, whether or not devoted Indians fans want to admit it, is a symbol of that process, and so are the uses to which he's put.
Baseball has already embarrassed itself by nonchalantly allowing the use of demeaning nicknames and racist caricatures, but the most revealing humiliation might have occurred last week, when beloved Hall of Famer Pedro Martínez praised the Cleveland Indians after ALDS Game 3 by using Native American stereotypes while his panel-mates laughed along.
Advertisement
During the TBS postgame show, Martínez made a seriously ill-advised joke about “hunting Indians” when he was an active player, then said he would “pay tribute to the Indians” and put his hand to his mouth, imitating a war cry. Martínez attempted to apologize quickly after the clip circulated, saying, “I send my apologies if I was misunderstood when I was trying to pay tribute to the Cleveland Indians on the TBS post season show.” The clip, in case you think critics misunderstood:
Martínez's mockery of Native Americans in the name of the Cleveland Indians is a telling example of just how the franchise “honors” indigenous peoples. Martínez is from the Dominican Republic, after all, and while that country, like most other Latin American countries, has its own appalling history of mistreatment and marginalization of indigenous populations, the imagery he's invoking here is highly and specifically American.
Advertisement
Who do you think taught Martínez—or any other immigrant—that such markers of savagery as the word “hunt” or a childish interpretation of a war cry are associated with Indians? He didn't grow up in the American school system, where curricula often include whitewashed histories of the interactions between European settlers and indigenous Americans; these stereotypes and tropes spread his way nevertheless, through such distinct cultural products as, well, sports teams. Here is a consequence of coming up with excuse after excuse to permit the use of racist caricatures and nicknames in sports: an immigrant learning that part of the American experience involves degrading Indians.
None of this will influence Cleveland fans to stop showing up in headdresses and redface to baseball games at the ironically named Progressive Field. “Native Americans have other issues to worry about,” they'll cry, and they'll have a point, as many Native Americans will tell you. The games will go on.

The use of a shitty depiction of a Native American as the primary logo for a baseball team will remain wrong and harmful, though, in ways that aren't up for debate for any empathetic and critically thinking American. There is a case that will be heard by the Supreme Court that may eradicate or confirm a particular aspect of trademark law that technically disallows the registration of disparaging trademarks, and the court's decision may solve this issue. But for now, it is the Cleveland Indians' choice to use the symbol despite their high-minded claims that they are distancing themselves from it, and that right is laid out explicitly in the Bill of Rights written and signed on the stolen, sacred soil that was renamed “America.”
“Good habits make all the difference.” —Aristotle
It is wise for each of us, from time to time, to stop and evaluate our lives as we seek to make the most of them.
The start of a calendar year provides an opportunity to look back at the decisions that shaped our lives during the past year and gives us an extra push to make adjustments for the next one. Every new January represents a natural opportunity to evaluate the direction of our lives, adjust course if necessary, adopt new habits, or make healthy changes. Birthdays can often serve the same purpose.
Regardless of the time of year, self-reflection is important. Consider then, these 11 resolutions for a better you—proven by science. It is, after all, our habits that determine the course of our lives.
1. Exercise. Most of us recognize the benefits of physical exercise: healthy bodies, healthy minds, and healthy confidence. Some studies indicate exercise contributes to a positive body image even prior to any body weight or shape change—with as little as two weeks of regular exercise. And with increasing study centered around the effectiveness of minimalist workouts, each of us should be able to find the time to get started.
2. Less television. Those seeking intentionality realize the negative influence television has on their mind: it impacts our worldview, encourages consumerism, oversimplifies life, and results in less life satisfaction. Even more drastic, scientists are beginning to discover the habit of watching too-much television may be negatively impacting our life expectancy as well. Nobody is telling you to throw your television in the nearest dumpster, but deciding to cut back in the next year may be one of the best decisions you could ever make.
3. Go outside. According to recent studies published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, simply spending time outside with nature contributes to increased energy, wards off feelings of exhaustion, and results in a heightened sense of well-being. Of course, simply walking from your front door to the car door doesn't count. So make a point this coming year to find an excuse to be outside—you can always start with a simple walk around the block each evening.
4. Read fiction. Recently, researchers have begun studying the physical impact reading stories has on our brain. As you might expect, they are discovering reading results in heightened connectivity and brain activity—sometimes, even up to 5 days after the book has been completed. If you read fiction, you already know this to be true. If you don't, this could be your year to start. You may enjoy beginning with The Hunger Games or Divergent.
5. Give. Numerous studies show charitable giving boosts happiness and reduces stress—especially when the generosity promotes positive social connection. If you don't already, find a cause or person you believe in and offer them consistent monthly support. They will benefit. You will benefit. And the world will be a better place.
6. Serve. Volunteering provides great value for our lives and the lives of those we choose to enrich. One study from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard Business School, and the Yale School of Management found that when a person volunteers his or her time, they begin to feel like they have more time and are more efficient. Additionally, volunteers feel better about themselves, experience lower stress levels, and develop a deeper connection with others. The golden number appears to be 100 hours per year (2 hours/week).
7. Buy less stuff and more experiences. In studies presented at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, researchers suggest that buying life experiences rather than material possessions leads to greater happiness for both the consumer and those around them. Decide today to spend less money this year on possessions and more money on meaningful, memorable experiences. You'll be glad you did in more ways than one.
8. Display gratitude. Psychologists have scientifically proven that one of the greatest contributing factors to overall happiness in your life is how much gratitude you show. And it can be experienced with as little as three expressions each day (“Thank you for…”). Getting started is so easy and beneficial. It could be the easiest decision you make all year.
9. Practice smiling. In a fascinating study conducted at the Michigan State Business School, customer service professionals who fake a smile throughout the day worsen their mood. But people who smile as a result of cultivating positive thoughts improve their mood and withdraw less. Simply put, one easy way to improve your mood throughout the next year is to intentionally recall pleasant memories or think more positively about your current situation—and then smile because of it.
10. Stop and just play. Our world is becoming increasingly busy and the temptation to measure our worth by external factors continues to grow. As a result, taking time to slow down and just play is becoming increasingly rare. But play is fun and enjoyable. Play enriches the lives of children by exercising their mind and body. And it has the same positive effect on adults. So make an extra point to just slow down and play constructively with your friends or kids.
11. Determine to be happy. Two experimental studies published in The Journal of Positive Psychology this past year offer ground-breaking research on the cultivation of happiness. Based on the experiments, participants who listened to “happy” music and actively tried to feel happier reported the highest level of positive mood afterwards—more so than those who simply listened to the music. In other words, determining to be happy is a productive decision towards achieving it.
Adopting 11 new habits at one time is almost certainly too much to ask. But choose one or two specifically. And then, give it 29 days. You'll be surprised how quickly they become habit.

Danny Rand (Finn Jones) won't be seen wearing his iconic green and yellow garb on the Netflix series Marvel's Iron Fist, and showrunner Scott Buck has come forward to explain why.
In an interview with SFX Magazine (via GamesRadar), Buck said "there was no good reason" they could think to put him in that outfit. In the series, Rand "is still discovering who he is as a hero and where he is going to be." As such, he's "not yet ready to put on a mask or a costume."

However, protecting his identity "does become an issue for the character." Buck went on to note that Rand "is someone who is rather well known as a billionaire, so he can't necessarily go out in public and do the things he does without being recognized."
Like the other Marvel's other Netflix-exclusive series, Iron Fist will be grounded in real life, though there will be a few hints at the comic's mythical component. "We're trying to keep things extremely grounded and real and tell our stories through characters," Buck explained, noting that while "the mystical aspect is something we like to hint at," it isn't something that is extensively explored.

Alex Osborn is a freelance writer for IGN. You can follow him on Twitter and subscribe to his YouTube channel.
Alexandra brings the case against her mother, Dale. Whenever Dale travels, she likes to adopt the local accent in conversation with those around her. Alexandra is embarrassed every time she does this and wish she would stop. Who's right? Who's wrong?
If you want to listen to the Dick Van Dyke interview on Bullseye that was referenced in this episode, you can find it here.
EVIDENCE
Here's a comprehensive list of Alexandra's Googlings:
A) “I urge you all never to mimic another person's accent without permission, and here is why […] I understand that for many people I've met, mimicking my accent is not something that is done out of spite. Most would assure me the reason they do it is because they like it, and I too am guilty of copying an accent out of admiration. However, when someone tries to impersonate me, two things happen: They do an awful job at it, and I instantly feel like a joke.”
-Excerpt from the article “Don't Do A British Accent” by Gena-Mour Barrett
B) "My favourite (sarcasm) are the people who think because I am white and British it is acceptable to imitate my accent when having a conversation. Now if I were Indian would they do the same? I think not. Just like the author said. We are not here to amuse and entertain you."
-From this webpage (comments section)
C) "What is cultural appropriation? Cultural appropriation is the adoption or theft of icons, rituals, aesthetic standards, and behavior from one culture or subculture by another. It generally is applied when the subject culture is a minority culture or somehow subordinate in social, political, economic, or military status to the appropriating culture."

Sir Alex Ferguson is to have hip surgery this summer - and could miss the start of the new season.
The Manchester United boss, 71, has been troubled by a hip problem for some time and will go under the knife before the Premier League campaign kicks off. But with only 18 days between United returning from their pre-season tour and the opening day of the league season, Fergie has left himself battling to be fit in time.
And senior United sources say they would be “amazed” if Ferguson - who could need a walking stick to aid his recovery - is in the dug-out for the start of next term in August.
Ferguson has planned the operation so he does not miss United's three-week pre-season tour of Thailand, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong this summer.
United last night confirmed Ferguson is to have an operation, but stressed it will have no impact on his future at the club.
United do not return from their pre-season tour until July 30 and play Manchester City or Wigan in the Community Shield at Wembley on August 11.
With Ferguson set for surgery in early August, that leaves little time for him to make a full recovery and be back in the dugout for that game.

The new Premier League season starts on August 17 and it is not clear if Ferguson will have recovered in time to oversee the first game of United's title defence.
Ferguson, who has been in charge of United since 1986, has always said he will carry on in the role as long as his health allows him to do so.
The United boss had a pacemaker fitted in 2004, when he was 62, after being diagnosed with a heart condition, and was back at work within days.
He was at the centre of a heath scare a year ago while attending a dinner in Glasgow, when he suffered a nosebleed that would not stop and was taken to hospital.
The United boss put the episode down to taking seven flights in the space of a week and said it was his body's way of telling him to slow down.
Earlier this season Ferguson addressed the issue of his retirement and said: “This question comes up more and more simply because, as each year goes on, I get older.
(Image: Stu Forster)
“It's a fact of life. I can't avoid that. The issue is how I feel within myself.
“As you get older, you are not guaranteed your health. No-one is when you get into your 70s. Touch wood, my health remains for a long time yet.
“At the moment, everything is hunky dory, but you never know.”
Ferguson has only missed three games during his 1,497-match United reign and will be determined his hip surgery does not see him add to that list.
He missed a Manchester derby at Maine Road - which United won 1-0 in his absence - in November 2000 to attend son Mark's wedding in South Africa.
The United boss also missed a 3-2 defeat to Middlesbrough, at Old Trafford in 1998, to attend a funeral. The other game from which he was absent was a League Cup tie at Scunthorpe in 2010, when he was in Spain scouting United keeper David De Gea.
Mirror Sport revealed yesterday that Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp is the man the United hierarchy currently favour a successor when Ferguson decides to retire.

“Siemens is acquiring Mentor as part of its Vision 2020 concept to be the Benchmark for the New Industrial Age. It's a perfect portfolio fit to further expand our digital leadership and set the pace in the industry,” said Joe Kaeser, President and CEO of Siemens AG.
“With Mentor, we're acquiring an established technology leader with a talented employee base that will allow us to supplement our world-class industrial software portfolio. It will complement our strong offering in mechanics and software with design, test and simulation of electrical and electronic systems,” said Klaus Helmrich, member of the Managing Board of Siemens.
Mentor is headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, U.S., and has employees in 32 countries worldwide. In its fiscal year ended January 31, 2016, Mentor had over 5,700 employees and generated revenue of approximately $1.2 billion with an adjusted operating margin of 20.2%. Siemens expects these attractive margins to continue in the future and contribute significantly to the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software business of Siemens Digital Factory (DF) Division, which Mentor will join. Mentor serves a large, diverse customer base of marquee systems companies and IC/semiconductors companies with over 14,000 global accounts across communications, computer, consumer electronics, semiconductor, networking, aerospace, multimedia, and transportation industries. Mentor is viewed as a global leader in strategic industry segments including IC design, test and manufacturing; electronic systems design and analysis; and emerging markets including automotive electronics.
“Combining Mentor's technology leadership and deep customer relationships with Siemens' global scale and resources will better enable us to serve the growing needs of our customers, and unlock additional significant opportunities for our employees,” said Walden C. Rhines, chairman and CEO of Mentor . “Siemens is an ideal partner with financial depth and stability, and their resources and additional investment will allow us to innovate even faster and accelerate our vision of creating top-to-bottom automated design solutions for electronic systems. We are excited to join the Siemens family, as it is clear they share the same values and focus on customer success, and are pleased that this transaction provides immediate and certain value to our stockholders.”
Siemens expects to achieve synergies through a combination of revenue growth and anticipated margin expansion, with a total EBIT impact of over €100 million within 4 years from closing the transaction. Additionally, the transaction is expected to be EPS accretive within three years from closing. Closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected in Q2 of calendar 2017. Mentor will be part of the PLM software business of Siemens' DF Division. DF is the industry leader in automation technology and a leading provider of PLM software.
“By adding Mentor's electronic design automation solutions and talented experts to our team, we're greatly enhancing our core competencies for product design that creates a very precise digital twin of any smart product and production line,” noted Helmrich.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MENTOR TRANSACTION
Boyd Rankin chose Test cricket over shepherding Ireland's efforts to the top flight © Getty Images
Something strange and almost eerie happened on September 3 this year. The twitterati focused on non-Test cricket. For several hours the Irishmen leading England's charge over their countrymen was a trending topic. That the top run-scorer, Eoin Morgan, and the strike bowler, Boyd Rankin, had both previously played for Ireland was trivia gold, the currency of choice in social media reporting.
It provoked many to consider the selection policy of the ECB and, perhaps for the first time, to view this not just in the context of English success but also in light of the development of cricket on the continent. The prevailing view of the commentators and columnists was that Test cricket would always be the pinnacle of a player's career and therefore that as long as eligibility criteria were met the opportunities should follow. It was tough luck on Ireland, they conceded, but they could be proud of the calibre of the players they produced.
There were a few nods to Ireland's formal application for full member status but these amounted to little more than an acknowledgement that the availability of Morgan and Rankin would be jolly useful in such a lofty aim. Very few got to the nub, which is that Ireland are being assessed for a decision on which the whole future of their cricket hinges, without being able to showcase their best players. This issue is anything but trivial to Irish cricket.
It seems the old adage that the ultimate honour and accomplishment in sport is to represent your country is, sadly, just a romantic notion. Rankin had the opportunity to spearhead Ireland's emergence as a major cricketing force, to leave a true and lasting legacy. Instead he chose to explore the possibilities of Test cricket and that choice is up to him. The ECB have set out their stall. They will select the best players available for selection, and will not in any way jeopardise their own aspirations to be the leading team in the world.
This leaves us with Ireland and their challenge to steer a course to full membership when their best players are jumping ship. Warren Deutrom, CEO of Cricket Ireland, explains what they have done to retain their players. "We surveyed our players last year and asked them directly what sort of structures we needed to retain our best talent in Ireland. The primary responses revolved around developing our own professional domestic structure, striving to play Test cricket, and putting in place our own national academy. These are now live initiatives that form the spine of our strategic objectives for the national squad."
Ireland is one of six associate nations that form part of the ICC's High Performance Programme, seeking to bridge the gap between leading associate nations and full members. This provides additional funding that enables Cricket Ireland to offer contracts to their players and they hope to use this financial incentive to gain long-term commitment from senior players.
"We intend to offer our most important players two-year contracts that take us up to the World Cup," says Deutrom. "One of the roles of our new national academy manager will be to instil in our young players the desire to remain loyal to their country and to sell the benefits that will accrue cricket-wise and financially as the game continues to grow in Ireland."
The model for Irish success is Kevin O'Brien, who has enjoyed a professional career and gained a global profile through starring for Ireland. In Deutrom's words: "He doesn't need to play for an English county in order to further his cricket career".
Cricket Ireland has notified the ECB of their professional squad of players for the 2015 World Cup and hope that their English counterparts will not seek to undermine their preparation. "The ECB recognised that the ICC has invested significant funding into Ireland to help us to be more competitive on the world stage and that, as the World Cup is the most high-profile benchmark of competitive progress, it stands to reason that we should prepare for that event without fear of losing vital players in the lead-up."
With the Future Tours Programme already creaking with fixture fatigue and the full members' share of revenue set to shrink if there is an 11th slice of the pie, Ireland will need philanthropy to prevail over finances
While acknowledging that losing Morgan and Rankin has lessened their chances of full member scalps, Deutrom is focusing on the future and pointing to the young squad that secured recent victories over Scotland, as well as the exciting crop of teenagers who will be nurtured in their academy. "ICC will only be concerned if we don't identify and develop new talent to take the place of those we lose, and all we had was just one 'golden generation'. ICC also looks at the broader picture of whether the game is growing in popularity: whether there is media coverage, whether there is corporate buy-in, and government support. We are only getting stronger on and off the pitch and we believe that, eventually, our case for elevation will become unanswerable."
Of course that desire, however strong Ireland's case, will be decided by the full members, who dominate decision-making in the ICC's governance structure. Unsurprisingly, in such a system self-interest often prevails. In this way Ireland's objective is as much to win support amongst the full members, as Bangladesh did, as meet the ICC's criteria. But with the Future Tours Programme already creaking with fixture fatigue and the full members' share of revenue set to shrink if there is an 11th slice of the pie, they will need philanthropy to prevail over finances.
Ger Siggins, a seasoned Irish cricket correspondent and champion of their bid for full member status, believes the lure of Test cricket holds the key. "The players who have gone to England said they wanted to play Test cricket, so obviously that is what Ireland has to push for. The only difference then would be the money, and Cricket Ireland can't compete with the ECB there. To keep players interested Ireland will need to upgrade its fixture list, keep qualifying for ICC events and bring more money into the domestic game.
"It is incredibly damaging that Ireland cannot field a full-strength side. Bangladesh got into the elite on little more than one win at the 1999 World Cup. Ireland has beaten five full members in the last decade, some several times, and still can't get a sniff of full member status."
But this is not just a case of a full member exploiting the resources of an associate neighbour, wherever you stand on how ethical or significant that is. A fortnight before the game in Malahide, Kyle Jarvis, the promising Zimbabwean seamer, ditched country for county in signing for Lancashire. He could play Test cricket but has chosen not to. Perhaps then it isn't about Test cricket at all but personal ambition. Kevin O'Brien is an associate player earning a good living, courted by lucrative Twenty20 franchises and boasting a global fan-base. Jarvis is a Test player for an unfashionable team with little career security.
Ryan ten Doeschate used Netherlands as a springboard for wealth and fortune. If Ireland enable Paul Stirling to do the same perhaps he won't listen to English overtures and who knows, in doing so in time he may find himself playing Test cricket for his home nation.

After years of opposing the full-scale legalization of marijuana, California's outspoken Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom has officially come out in favor of ending prohibition on weed. And he's urging other politicians to do the same.
"These laws just don't make sense anymore," Newsom said in a recent interview with the New York Times. "It's time for politicians to come out of the closet on this."
"It's shocking, from my perspective, the number of people that we all know who are recreational marijuana users," added Newsom. "These are incredibly upstanding citizens: Leaders in our community, and exceptional people. Increasingly, people are willing to share how they use it and not be ashamed of it."
This position is a policy shift for Newsom, who previously only supported legalizing cannabis for medical use. However, he predicted this ideological shift would occur eventually. In a 2010 interview with SF Appeal's Chris Roberts, the then-San Francisco mayor said he wasn't quite ready to support full-scale legalization:
"This is a hard one for me... but I'm just not there yet," Newsom told The Appeal. "I'll never cede my strong support [for medical cannabis]," but concerns over exactly how full-on legalization would be implemented -- from taxation to dispensation to "the message it sends" -- soured Prop 19 in Newsom's eyes. "I'm frustrated with myself on this one, to be truthful," Newsom added. "But I'm just not there yet. I hope to be there someday, though."
Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, views Newsom's change of heart through a political lens. "Gavin Newsom is clearly an ambitious and calculating politician who has his sights set on higher elected office. For him to come out in favor of marijuana legalization shows that this issue has arrived in a big way," explained Angell. "Once looked at as a dangerous 'third-rail' of politics, polls show that the time is coming--if it hasn't already arrived--when opposing marijuana legalization will be a real political liability, at least for Democrats running in primary elections."
Angell notes he was disappointed Newsom essentially sat out of the debate over California's Proposition 19, which failed to legalize recreational marijuana in 2010. But he hopes that the lieutenant governor will get involved in future legalization efforts.
Voters in Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana this past November, and there's been some speculation that California may soon follow suit.
Expert: Lawyers 'all over the place' on constitutionality of Prop. 8 David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published: Thursday November 6, 2008
Print This Email This Protests, rallies and three separate legal challenges are currently under way in response to the passage in California of "Proposition 8," which outlaws same-sex marriage.
According to CNN's Kiran Chetry, it seems as though no matter what the outcome of the challenges, the 18,000 existing same-sex marriages will remain intact, because "California's attorney general says that the constitutional amendment is not retroactive."
However, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin told Chetry, "The law is really unclear here. ... Everyone is all over the place. Some [lawyers] said, 'When you look at the language of Proposition 8, it is very clear that it was meant to be retroactive.' ... Another law professor that I spoke to said, 'That is absolutely, fundamentally ridiculous. The bottom line is this is a fundamental right that was given to couples, and this is a right that is not going to be given away.'"
"I think that we're going to see a lot of litigation here," Hostin concluded. "Everyone is in a legal limbo." She suggested that the California Supreme Court, which "allowed these marriages in the first place," will weigh in but that the constitutionality of Proposition 8 may ultimately have to be decided by the US Supreme Court.

Muhammad makes appearance on campus
ACCORDING TO THAT old maxim, it is impolite to discuss sex, religion, or politics with strangers. On the typical Canadian university campus, however, we take the opposite approach, bombarding students with condoms and political pamphlets without even pausing to get their names.
While we're quite forward with sex and politics, usually we're more hesitant to jump right into talking about religion. Maybe it's just out of respect for people's most sincerely held beliefs that we hesitate to talk God on a whim, but it seems this tendency toward respect is unravelling on campus and around the world.
The new big thing in atheist and secularist activism is to desecrate those symbols considered sacred by believers, perhaps in the hopes of sparking debate on important questions like the existence of God or the social utility of religion, or perhaps just to frustrate and anger those who do believe.
Consider the Muhammad cartoon controversy that occurred in Denmark six years ago: Jyllands-Posten published a series of 12 editorial cartoons containing depictions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, portraying him both neutrally and as a terrorist. For those unfamiliar with Islamic theology, most Muslims believe portrayals of Muhammad are to be avoided and offensive portrayals are simply wrong.
Jyllands-Posten's editors knew this, but printed the cartoons anyway—presumably to encourage debate about the issues of free speech and self-censorship in the Western press. The cartoons lived up to their billing: They were reprinted around the world and set off mass protests in Europe and the Middle East.
Or consider PZ Myers, an associate professor of biology at the University of Minnesota and an icon to many in the more militant faction of the atheist movement. Myers has made a name for himself by impaling a consecrated host—which Catholics consider holy—on a rusty nail. Combine that with spilling some coffee grounds over a copy of the Qur'an and you practically have an atheist Moses.
Even the more respectable figures in the New Atheist movement have pursued such tactics, with Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens calling for the arrest of Pope Benedict XVI, the spiritual leader of the world's largest religious group, on charges of crimes against humanity. Let's not forget, this is the same Hitchens who called Mother Teresa a “bitch” and said, “It's a shame there's no hell for her to go to.” He later apologized, but that sort of disrespect speaks for itself.
At the University of Ottawa, our very own Atheist Club, formally known as the Atheist Community of the University of Ottawa (ACUO), has recently taken to copying such tactics. At the club fair, they displayed a stick figure image of Muhammad on a laptop (their creativity is striking).
I met with third-year student Scott Keith, the president of the ACUO, to discuss the tone of the debate surrounding the existence of God and the effects of religion on society. Over the course of our discussion, he maintained that the ACUO is a social group that is “not trying to de-convert anyone,” instead focusing on the “promo[tion] of secular values.” But he sees no problem with his club's posting of the Muhammad stick figure, saying that even though it is inflammatory and that most Muslims on campus would likely take offence to the drawing, it is not illegal.
There is nothing illegal about it—and there shouldn't be. People have the right to express their opinions. Besides, who do we trust to decide what sort of expression is too offensive to be allowed? The state, through blasphemy laws and human rights codes? Or should the student federation be able to decide what sort of expression is appropriate on our campus?
But just because it is legal to offend people doesn't mean it's right, or constructive, to do so. Universities should be among the best venues for discussing the soundness and social utility of religious belief, but when we go out of our way to offend people of faith, the entire discussion grinds to a halt: People, by nature, are less likely to engage with those who mock their deepest-held beliefs. If their goal is reasoned discussion, the New Atheist movement has shot itself in the foot by offending the sensibilities of believing students.
To get the other side of the story, I met with third-year student Adam Gilani, president of the U of O Muslim Student Association. His take on the situation was rather fitting: “If we're trying to foster a respectful and genuine conversation, we need to take a pause to be mindful and respectful of other people's beliefs and values.” When we engage in a respectful conversation, people are more likely to feel comfortable and communicate better.
Gilani noted while he did not interpret the Muhammad display as a personal affront, he knew some of his membership would consider the display highly offensive. He acknowledged that an expression code would be necessarily limited and likely ineffective, preferring instead a mutual agreement on boundaries stemming from respectful conversation.
As far as I'm concerned, Gilani is right: If it is to be of any value, dialogue on religious issues must be respectful. While nobody can force others to act respectfully, we can and should speak up when they are acting with an insensitivity that demeans belief and offends believers.
It's not just about politeness—it's about how we conduct the most important debates in our society. We cannot allow the shrillest and most offensive voices to drown out a reasoned and respectful discussion. Now that's a maxim worth listening to.

In the bizarre legal world of civil forfeiture, innocent owners must prove their innocence, prosecutors sue the property itself, and, in a Kafkaesque twist, the government can permanently confiscate property even if the owner was found not guilty. Thanks to a two-track system, civil forfeiture shreds due process. While the owners are prosecuted in criminal court, forfeiture litigation against the property proceeds in civil court, which has fewer safeguards and requires less evidence for the government to prevail. That can lead to bizarre case outcomes, like a Minnesota man who was acquitted of burglary, but still had to forfeit his car.
Thankfully, this travesty of justice is now outlawed in Utah. Under newly signed legislation, SB 87, if claimants are acquitted of the crime that gave rise to the forfeiture, prosecutors must return their seized property. (Forfeiture can still proceed in plea deals.) Meanwhile, anytime an agency seizes property valued at under $10,000, they must return the property to the claimant, unless prosecutors file criminal charges within 60 days of filing a forfeiture complaint. By banning forfeitures from the acquitted, Utah's reform is functionally similar to the 12 states that require a criminal conviction in most or all forfeiture cases.
“No one acquitted in criminal court should lose his property in civil court,” said Lee McGrath, senior legislative counsel at the Institute for Justice. “This change makes Utah's law consistent with the great American presumption that a person and his property are innocent until proven guilty.”
SB 87 earned near unanimous support in the Utah State Legislature, before Gov. Gary Herbert signed the bill late last week.
Recent data suggests the new reforms should protect many Utahans from an unjust civil forfeiture system. According to a report published last summer by the Utah Commission of Criminal and Juvenile Justice, half of all cash forfeitures were under $1,324. That's roughly the size of the average American's cable bill—and a far cry from seizing assets owned by drug kingpins.
Moreover, out of all 393 state forfeiture cases in 2015, only six percent resulted in a criminal verdict in a criminal forfeiture proceeding or a guilty plea. In other words, the vast majority of forfeiture cases did not involve a criminal conviction.
However, the state did not track the number of final outcome of criminal cases, including acquittals, that were related to forfeiture cases. That omission, along with several others, was why Utah received just a C grade for tracking seized property, according to a nationwide report card on transparency by the Institute for Justice.
In order to expand the state's forfeiture reporting requirements, lawmakers unanimously passed SB 70, which was also signed into law last week. SB 70 will require agencies to detail if any criminal charges were filed, and if they resulted in a conviction or acquittal. Agencies will also have to report the estimated value for seized property and the agency's costs for storing seized property and litigating the forfeiture. Tracking this kind of information is crucial for citizens, lawmakers and the law enforcement agencies themselves to determine if forfeiture programs are actually fighting crime.
These two bills mark just the latest chapter to stop police confiscation in Utah. Back in 2000, voters, by a 2 to 1 margin, approved a ballot initiative that enacted one of the nation's toughest protections against forfeiture. But four years later, after intensive pressure by law enforcement, legislators gutted many of the initiative's biggest reforms. And in 2013, the state legislature unanimously approved a bill that made it even easier for police to seize property. Thankfully, after the Libertas Institute revealed what happened, lawmakers later rolled back many—though not all—of the provisions that tilted the scales of justice away from property owners and towards the government.
In Congress, Utah Sen. Mike Lee has been a staunch opponent of civil forfeiture. “Due process is often ignored when it comes to civil asset forfeiture,” Sen. Lee remarked at a Senate Judiciary hearing in 2015. “Federal forfeiture laws have enabled and, in some cases, even incentivized law enforcement practices that have great potential to threaten our liberty,” he added. Earlier this month, Sen. Lee cosponsored Sen. Rand Paul's FAIR Act, a drastic overhaul of federal forfeiture laws.
As Utah's reforms show, protecting property rights from the grasping hands of law enforcement truly crosses party lines. The national party platforms for both the Democrats and the Republicans endorsed forfeiture reform last summer. In fact, over the past three years, 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, have tightened their forfeiture laws.

The Fee-bag Party
One more thing among the myriad that I don't get. Air passengers in open revolt over fees on baggage. Somewhere along the way it came to be understood as another of our constitutional rights that you can pack the entire contents of your garage into your luggage and the airline will carry it for no charge. Fierce disciples of the free market suddenly start vibrating with anger when a carrier decides how it wants to price its service. It's a little like getting mad at a restaurant for not having one all-you-can-eat price. No, it's EXACTLY like that.
The really strange thing is that baggage is hardly an arbitrary place for pricing. Weight is a significant cost to flying a plane. Nor is it a place in which the consumer is helpless. Pack less, pay less! Did you REALLY need to bring that fire hydrant? What about fees for carry-on items? Does ANYONE enjoy the 20 minutes of slow-motion overhead bin Tetris before the plane takes off? It's NOT gouging. Airlines are not making off with giant profits. It's not nickel and diming. It's straightforward and logical fee for service. Right? --Tom Toles

In Lawsuit, U.S. May Have to Prove Why It Needs Phone Records Collection Program
In seeking to defeat a lawsuit challenging the legality of the bulk collection of phone records by the National Security Agency, the federal government's lawyers may have to prove that it's really a necessary tool to help protect the country against terrorist attacks.
That's one interesting tidbit in the 68-page ruling (which you can read below) by U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who today said in his opinion allowing the lawsuit to proceed that the NSA's collection program “almost certainly” infringes the right to privacy guaranteed in the Fourth Amendment.
In ruling that a collection of phone call metadata dating back five years “significantly intrudes” on a individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, Leon essentially challenged the government to justify its existence. He wrote that whether or not it actually rises to the level of being unconstitutional will turn on how effective the program actually is.
Leon wrote that the government has argued that the program is effective in identifying possible terrorists. But a key point is that the government has said that the program allows for those possible threats to be identified more quickly than they would be using other investigative techniques, yet offers no examples of when being so fast has made a difference. “The government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack or otherwise aided the government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature,” Leon wrote.
In fact, the only three instances cited by the government, in Leon's description, appear to have not been urgent or time sensitive at all. In one case, the FBI learned of a terrorist plot when it was in its “early stages,” and conducted an investigation before turning to the NSA's metadata collection to learn more about the people under investigation. In a second case, the metadata was used only after a terrorism suspect had been arrested in order to determine who else he had been communicating with. A third case revealed only a phone number belonging to a terrorism suspect that hadn't previously been known to investigators and that helped to corroborate connections to other terrorists that had already been suspected.
“There is no indication that these revelations were immediately useful or that they prevented an impending attack,” Leon wrote.
Most of this starts on the bottom of page 57 of the opinion embedded below. It basically means that in order for the government to keep the metadata program on the level, it's going to have to demonstrate the need for the extraordinary capabilities that it provides and prove that it's better than other ways of investigating terrorist threats.
Under the metadata collection program, revealed in June, documents disclosed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden showed that the NSA had collected vast troves of information about calls made by U.S. customers of Verizon Wireless to people overseas. The records don't include the contents of conversations, just logs of who called whom.
But the Fourth Amendment is pretty clear about when the government has a right to gather this kind of information, and it practically always involves getting a warrant. Here's the text of that amendment:
“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”
The government will argue otherwise in the expected appeal, but as this case winds its way through the court system, the disclosures could turn out to be interesting.
Klayman v. Obama by Brendan Sasso
A Muslim woman claims airport staff told her she would have to take off her hijab if she wanted to get on a flight to London.
Aghnia Adzkia was passing through security when she was asked to take off her religious headscarf.
Ms Adzkia claims to have been discriminated against and says she saw nuns passing through security without being asked to remove their habits.
The Indonesian citizen who lives in London made a video of her experience at Ciampino Airport in the Italian capital of Rome on Sunday.
In the clip the Goldsmith's University student can be seen repeatedly demanding to see the law stating that the hijab must be removed at an airport security check.
But the officers were adamant that they would not let her pass unless she followed their rules.
The female security official can be heard saying: 'You could hide something in your hair. If you don't take it off, we do not know if there's something inside, okay? You are not safe for us.'
She alleges that a female security staff member asked her to follow her to a private room so she could check the hijab.
But Ms Adzkia refused to take off her hijab claiming she was being unfairly targeted.
She claims a male security officer then dragged her out of the security area in an 'indecent way' grabbing her bag and shouting at her to be quiet.

Ms Adzkia claims to have been discriminated against and says she saw nuns passing through security without being asked to remove their habits at Ciampino Airport (pictured)
Ms Adzkia posted a furious social media post about the experience, which she says took place as she was traveling to London.
She wrote: 'I wasn't prepared to trust them unless they could cite me a law or provide me with a legal document that saying they were authorised to have to check what is underneath of my hijab.
'It is a matter of human dignity and rights. For what reason were they asked me to take off my hijab?'
She added: 'I AM A MUSLIM HIJABI, NOT A TERRORIST!
'The way they treated me has shown that they do not respect a Muslim female wearing the hijab.'
Ms Adzkia posted a furious social media post about the experience, which she says took place as she was traveling to London
Later the same evening, Ms Adzkia booked a ticket to fly to London from Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, also in Rome.
Security staff again asked her to remove her hijab, this time she agreed and was able to get her flight.
Ms Adzkia wrote: 'I wanted to prove to them that I have nothing to hide and that I am not a terrorist.
'In the meantime, I saw two nuns wearing headscarves, but they weren't asked to take them off.
'Is this what you call fair treatment and respect? Where are my human rights?'
A social media post by Ms Adzkia has received 20,000 views and more than 100 comments after being shared more than 400 times

But an official at the Indonesian Embassy argued that, when in Rome, Aghnia should have complied with the security officers' wishes.
Aisyah Allamanda, an official based in Rome, said: 'The numerous times I've flown out of Rome's airport, I also experienced the same kind of security check as I also happen to wear a hijab.
'The same applies to others who wear the hijab at Rome KBRI, female Muslims believe that they can't take off their headscarves in public so they are provided a private room for a female officer to carry out the check.
'If we refuse, I can understand if the security officer acts aggressively towards us.'
Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Adzkia said: 'I completely understand about what is going in the world lately. I stand against terrorism and that's not Islam.
'Yet, what I've experienced in Rome was shocking, the way they treated me indecently has shown discrimination. I understand if it is for security reason, but why did they not give me a second to read the law?'
Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Adzkia said: 'I completely understand about what is going in the world lately. I stand against terrorism and that's not Islam'
A spokesman for the Rome airport said: 'What happened to Ms Aghnia Adzkia solely and exclusively concerns compliance with safety procedures. The passenger, when passing the security gates, set off an alarm in the head area and it was therefore necessary to investigate the case, which could not be overlooked. For this reason, our staff asked her to go through to a private room, where they could check her head and headdress, as is strictly required by European and national laws, the purpose of which is to ensure safety and civil cohabitation.
'When Ms Aghnia refused to remove her headdress, requesting to read the legislation, she was shown the National Security Programme, which was promptly translated into English by our staff. Further to her continued refusal, our staff were forced to move the passenger away from the control area. Ms Aghnia subsequently returned to that area (and, on that occasion, filmed the video) and then left Ciampino airport. She later departed from Fiumicino airport on another flight, passing through security without any issues, this time removing her headdress.
'We are truly sorry for the fact that the young passenger had a negative experience whilst travelling via Ciampino airport. At the same time, however, we reiterate that what happened is completely unrelated to any form of discrimination. The passenger simply did not wish to comply with basic security requirements, which are implemented with due care and sensitivity by our staff, in the interests of safety for all passengers, including Ms Aghnia Adzkia.'
Costa Rica News – Costa Rica's organic farming area has decreased by 33% in just a few years (from 2010 to 2013). This fall follows the international economic crisis. The area that was used for organic farming went from 11,115 hectares to 7,448 hectares.
This trend is due to lower international demand for organic products. This is because people come to prefer organic goods because of an awareness of the environment and the effects of produce on the farmer and the consumer.
These good ideals of caring for the environment and the farmer get pushed aside when money gets tight, as organic products can cost 30% more than the conventional ones. This high cost and low demand might be why Costa Rica only has 2,159 organic farmers.
Other factors affect this number, as well. For instance, to switch from conventional to organic farming, one must wait 3 years and meet many requirements to get the certification.
Bananas, coffee, sugar cane and pineapple are the main products organic farmers harvest, without any chemicals. 69% of those organic products are exported, and only 10% make it to local supermarkets, with the rest being sold at fairs and to restaurants.
Singapore-based bitcoin startup CoinPip is one of 10 technology companies selected by a government agency to represent the country at this year's South by Southwest (SXSW) event in the US in March.
Notably, this is the first time a national government has shown such support for bitcoin enterprise development.
Participating companies are being sponsored to attend by Infocomm Investments, the investment arm of Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), a government agency and regulator.
CoinPip CEO Anson Zeall told CoinDesk he aims to use the appearance at SXSW to raise awareness of CoinPip and its services, and to show that bitcoin is not only a currency, but a technology capable of many different things.
It is also an opportunity to show off Singapore itself, he indicated, saying:
“Singapore is a great place for bitcoin startups. And having us showcased by Infocomm Investments is proof.”
The story so far
CoinPip began as a bitcoin merchant services provider and has begun expanding into new territory as a money payroll transfer business. The latest service sends money end-to-end to employees, freelancers and contractors around the world in under 48 hours, using bitcoin as an invisible medium.
The company also recently became a Ripple Gateway. Although that protocol will “take time to develop”, Zeall said, users who want to participate in the Ripple network or buy its currency, XRP, with Singapore dollars, can sign up now.
This is not the first time CoinPip's efforts in bitcoin have been recognized. The company joined ‘Batch 11‘ of 500 Startups' accelerator program in Mountain View, California, starting last November.
Whether or not CoinPip's involvement in 500 Startups influenced Infocomm Investments' decision is uncertain, but Zeall said the experience definitely changed the company's trajectory for the better.
“500 allowed us to delve deep into our analytics, get the right insights and take action. It does look like a leap-of-faith pivot, however there were a lot of learnings involved to get to where we are now.”
The company's merchant services will continue with the addition of a new and more user-friendly dashboards soon. While declining to provide figures on merchant numbers or volumes, Zeall said the company serves a number of “very loyal” businesses who are dedicated to accepting bitcoin.
CoinPip has operated mainly in the Singapore/Hong Kong market, but also processes transactions to and from the UK, Indonesia, Kenya and Australia. The firm also expressed plans to expand into South America and the US in the near future.
Criteria for selection
Director of Infocomm Investments' San Francisco office, Victor Tan, said that the companies chosen span a variety of verticals, including e-commerce, ad-tech, big data and even space, in one instance.
Startups chosen for sponsorship needed to show they have a ready product or service to show the public, and also that they have plans to expand into or do business with the US. The selection team also looked for companies that would be most relevant and interesting to the SXSW audience.
Singapore government initiative
According to its website, Infocomm Investment operates its accelerator program to “stimulate the growth of home-grown, innovation driven tech startups” at the early stage, by working with corporations, universities and professional accelerators.
It also seeks to identify and invest in Singaporean (or Singapore-based) companies with an international presence, investing alongside venture capitalists and engaging in outreach programs, such as participation in trade shows.
Together with the IDA, it forms part of Singapore's Intelligent Nation 2015 (iN2015) initiative – a 10-year plan to further develop Singapore's information technology economy.
SXSW is a series of annual festivals held in Austin, Texas, that incorporates music, film and interactive technology. The latter component has grown markedly in recent years to become one of the biggest tech startup events in the world.
SXSW will take place from 13th to 17th March.

Stéphane Lefebvre has confirmed he will not be competing for Citroën at either Rally Finland or Rally Germany, only minutes after securing an equal career best fifth place in Poland.
The Frenchman turned in what he described as “the best rally of my career so far,” taking two bonus points for finishing fourth in the Rally Poland powerstage earlier today to go with his top five result. However, he will now be absent from the Citroën lineup until Rally Spain in October.
“I won't be competing in the next two rallies, but I can head off on holiday in good spirits,” he said at the finish.
“It's a morale-boosting result for everyone after such a difficult start to the season. Whenever there was enough grip, I felt sufficiently confident to push.”
The announcement means Kris Meeke has likely secured a stay of execution over retaining his seat until after Rally Germany at the very least, with Andreas Mikkelsen likely to take Lefebvre's seat for his third one-rally deal at the fully tarmac event. The Norwegian has two podiums on the road surrounding Trier, finishing third in both 2014 and 2015 while racing for Volkswagen.
Citroën's full line-up for Finland is expected to be Meeke, Craig Breen and Khalid Al Qassimi, making only his second appearance of the season for French marque after finishing 17th overall at Rally de Portugal.
On August 20, 1977, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched the Voyager space probe from Cape Canaveral, Florida. A dozen years later, the space probe passed the planet of Neptune. Today, it is barreling into interstellar space some 14 billion kilometers from Earth and has only burned through about half of its fuel supply. It has slightly less than 60 pounds of fuel left in the tank, enough to keep the ship wandering the Milky Way for several decades.
Now, that is compelling fuel efficiency.
The secret ingredient NASA uses to propel these ships into deep space is called "thermoelectric material." The probes travel so far from the sun that there isn't enough solar radiation for photovoltaic panels to turn into electric power. Instead, NASA imbeds a nuclear material in a radioisotope thermal generator. As the radioisotope decays, it produces heat energy that is converted by thermoelectric materials into the electricity that powers the space probe.
Over the past three years, thermoelectric materials have attracted intense interest from energy researchers trying to turn exhaust heat from automobiles into electricity that can be used by the vehicle. The technology can provide both heating and cooling. Thermoelectric materials convert low-grade heat wasted in industrial processes or exhaust systems of a vehicle into electricity. Or they can transport heat from an external source of power and manipulate it to cool a surface.
The U.S. Department of Energy has funded a clutch of research efforts at the various Energy Frontier Research Centers in an effort to improve the underlying economics of the technology, which is currently too expensive for mainstream markets. Oliver Delaire, a scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is spearheading research with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology using neutron scattering and computer simulations to tweak the structure and dynamics of thermoelectric materials.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania's gubernatorial candidates' first debate will take place Monday night.
Republican Governor Tom Corbett and Democratic challenger Tom Wolf are to square off Monday evening at a Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce and Industry dinner in Hershey.
For months, independent polls have consistently shown Wolf, a wealthy York businessman, with a wide lead over Corbett, formerly the state's two-term attorney general.
Monday's forum is the first of three events agreed to by the candidates. The others will be on Oct. 1 in Philadelphia and Oct. 8 in Pittsburgh.
Wolf will have an opportunity to make news when he addresses a Pennsylvania Press Club luncheon earlier in the day.
Corbett will be in the limelight Friday, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie joins him at a GOP dinner in suburban Harrisburg.

Unfortunately for Miami president Donna Shalala, it lasted nearly a decade
By now, the name Nevin Shapiro has become practically a household name for all the wrong reasons. The former UM booster allegedly provided millions of dollars in gifts to Miami athletes over the span of two coaching eras and could now bring down the program through one extensive tell-all with Yahoo! Sports.
How Shapiro was able to get away with as much as he allegedly did without so much as a double-take from either Shalala or then-AD Paul Dee is astounding. Unless, of course, UM's administrative suits knew what was going on.
Shalala, in an interview with Time magazine dated about a month ago, said nothing could be further from the truth.
“I have no tolerance for breaking rules,” Shalala said before later adding that misconduct like Shapiro's “wouldn't have lasted two minutes under me.”
[/awkward]
There isn't much else in the form of football-related content in the interview; it's more about Shalala's work as UM's president. In fact, if you get a minute, it's a pretty great read over some of the academic accomplishments she's overseen.
Unfortunately for Shalala, football is often the public face of a university, and a damning report such as the one Yahoo! broke yesterday can overshadow other achievements.
Besides, pleading ignorance doesn't exactly bode well for the NCAA's confidence in a program.
Especially when one of its Committee on Infractions members, and former UM employees, already said it doesn't.
For the past few seasons, one of the biggest areas of weakness for the Chicago Blackhawks has been their power play production. Despite having stars like Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews at their disposal, the Hawks ranked 19th in the league last season, only converting 25 times out of 151 chances for a 16.6 percent success rate.
As you know, the Hawks overcame that lack of power play ability and ended up winning the Stanley Cup (against a Boston Bruins team that was even worse on the PP, converting only 14.8 percent of the time), but despite the positive overall outcome to the season, the Hawks still can't be satisfied with those numbers.
So far during the preseason, however, the drought has continued. The Hawks have had 12 opportunities on the power play and have failed to convert on any of them. While it would be easy to place the blame on not having their full lineup in place (Jonathan Toews and Marian Hossa have not played yet, and Duncan Keith did not play Thursday night), the fact remains that Joel Quenneville and the coaching staff are not satisfied with the results.
"They had a lot of pieces missing, too," he said of the Penguins' penalty killing unit. "Our power play had two A-plus looks, Kaner had two great chances. But no production. Can't be happy with it. We score 5-on-5 by shooting the puck. Why can't we shoot the puck 5-on-4?"
That is indeed the million dollar question, but shooting the puck isn't necessarily all the Hawks need to do on the power play in order to succeed.
They need a variety of guys doing a variety of things tactically in order to score. Yes, guys like Kane and Patrick Sharp need to be shooting the puck more often than they do, but they also need a power play quarterback at the blue line to move the puck quickly around the ice, and Sharp, who was primarily in that role last night with Keith out of the lineup, simply couldn't get that done.
There is one potential solution to that issue in the pipeline, as defenseman Adam Clendening looked positively excellent in that role during a few of the Hawks' man-advantage situations last night. He seemed to always know the correct thing to do with the puck, playing catch at the point to get the Penguins moving in their defensive formation and also occasionally driving into the zone to draw defenders away from the Hawks' shooters.
Unfortunately for the Hawks, they don't exactly have room to carry Clendening on the roster at this point, with Michal Rozsival, Sheldon Brookbank, and Nick Leddy all competing for spots on their third defensive pairing. That likely means that the Hawks will have to look in another direction for a puck mover at the top of their formation.
That job would likely fall upon the shoulders of Leddy, who has shown flashes of ability in that area but has not been able to prove beyond a doubt that he can handle the responsibility. As a result, he has been relegated largely to second unit duty during the Hawks' power plays, but he'll need to step up his game if the team is going to succeed more often in that area.
The other thing that the Hawks have to do in order to be successful in these situations is to get traffic in front of the net. Yes, Quenneville talks about getting bodies and pucks to the net so often that it seems like a cliche at this point, but the reality is that he is correct, and the Hawks can't seem to win those netfront battles often enough to succeed.
That's where bigger players like Bryan Bickell and Jimmy Hayes are going to have to step up their games. When Dustin Byfuglien hit his stride with the 2010 Hawks, it was because he was able to not only use his size to gain an edge in other areas of the ice, but because he provided an effective screen against goaltenders in power play situations. The results spoke for themselves, as the Hawks would consistently convert on those chances, and Hayes and Bickell will need to try to
improve their games in order to ascend to that role.
Obviously, the Hawks have proven that they can win a championship without a good power play in tow, but over the long run, can they really sustain enough even-strength scoring, as well as enough defense both at even strength and on the penalty kill, to compensate for their lack of goals on the PP? The answer to that is probably no, so as the preseason wears on, look for Quenneville to try just about every formation he can think of in order to jumpstart a group that has been stymied at every turn so far this preseason.
The news has just broken that Caps GM Brian MacLellan is the worst human being in the history of the world has traded Troy Brouwer, Pheonix Copley and a third-round draft pick to the St. Louis Blues in exchange for some guys name T.J. Oshie.
More like boshee if you ask us.
As you may know, we're kinda fans of Brouwer, and we're happy for the St. Louis Blues to be getting such a strong player and all around great guy. No, you know what, screw the St. Louis Blues and their stupid musical note logo. Congratulations on being a city best known for having an arch in it. You don't deserve him.
Had an amazing 4 yrs in Washington. My family and I thank all the fans and the #Caps organization for everything they have done for us! — Troy Brouwer (@TroyBrouwer36) July 2, 2015
But seriously, this sucks. It's been so much fun to cheer for Brouwer these last three seasons (plus one when we were still Knuble's Knights). He and Carmen have both been great sports about all the crazy stuff we do, and we were especially humbled by how enthusiastically they supported our fundraising efforts for Fort Dupont Ice Arena.
Ultimately, however, the Brouwer Rangers (like Knuble's Knights before them) have been more about our fellow fans than about the player we cheer for. Sure, it's fun to support a solid-but-not-quite-superstar player – with full gusto in the good times and blind loyalty in the bad. But our biggest honor is to play whatever small role we can in making hockey fandom even more fun for other fans. Whether it's stopping for a photo during warmups, tweeting stupid stuff or meeting up at an RMNB party, our No. 1 goal has always been to be the best fellow fans we can be. We hope we've succeeded in that so far.
Players come and go, but this community remains. We say let's keep creating great memories, like the ones we memorialized in this video. Thanks to all of you for making it so much fun. (And thanks for the flood of tweets and other messages of condolences. You guys are the best. And yes, we're really ok. Until we watch this video again.)
Video
As a post-script to all of this, a lot of you have already asked what the plan is. The truth is we don't know. We really don't talk about it until we have to. What we can say is that while there are a lot of changes coming up for us in real life, we're remaining season ticket holders and simply couldn't go back to coming to games like normal people would. What exactly that looks like remains to be seen.

The answer isn't quite so straightforward.
Pussy brings with it some sense of affection, warmth, and yes even validation. It is also attached to a woman who can hide her crazy long enough to be fun with.
I can't pretend I can just look past the pussy any more than I can willingly submit myself to her dictatorship i.e. relations~~~.
The plan is however to eventually look past the pussy and even laugh at their expense because as women age they get desperate. When the looks evaporate all that is left is a thick layer of expectations in a vagina with years of dried cum from variety of men.
No thanks.
It is a journey. Let's see whats out there when the haze lifts and pussy no longer matters.
Six Words: 'Black Babies Cost Less To Adopt'
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Caryn Lantz Courtesy of Caryn Lantz
NPR continues a series of conversations about The Race Card Project, where thousands of people have submitted their thoughts on race and cultural identity in six words. Every so often NPR Host/Special Correspondent Michele Norris will dip into those six-word stories to explore issues surrounding race and cultural identity for Morning Edition. You can find hundreds of six-word submissions and submit your own at www.theracecardproject.com.
Americans adopt thousands of children each year. And as the nation has become increasingly diverse, and with the growth of international adoption in recent decades, many of those children don't look like their adoptive parents. That intersection of race and adoption has prompted many people to submit their six words to The Race Card Project, including this submission from a Louisiana woman: "Black babies cost less to adopt."
Other contributors have also addressed the skin-color based fee structure for many adoptions, including Caryn Lantz of Minneapolis. Her six words: "Navigating world as transracial adopted family."
Lantz and her husband, both white, are the adoptive parents of two African-American boys. The couple had struggled for years to conceive a child. When they finally decided to turn to adoption they were willing to adopt kids of another race. But they were concerned by what they discovered about the differential costs.
Lantz says she remembers a phone call with an adoption agency social worker. "And [she] was telling us about these different fee structures that they had based on the ethnic background of the child. And ... they also had, sort of different track for adoptive parents."
Moving through the process would be quicker if the family was open to adopting an African-American (not biracial) child, the social worker explained to her. "And that is because they have children of color waiting," Lantz says. Adopting biracial, Latino, Asian or Caucasian children could be a slower process, she was told, because there were more parents waiting for them.

"And I remember hearing this and just sort of being dumbfounded that they would sort of segregate — to use a loaded term — segregate these children by ethnic background before they were even in this world," Lantz says. "That's when I started realizing that, OK, being a parent to a child of a different ethnic background — this is gonna be some work. There's going to be a lot of work on our end in order to be successful parents and to get our child ready for this world."
The Race Card Project spoke with social workers, adoption agencies and adoptive parents about adoption costs based on ethnicity. We discovered that this is not widely talked about, but it is common, Norris tells NPR's David Greene. "No one is comfortable about this."
Non-white children, and black children, in particular, are harder to place in adoptive homes, Norris says. So the cost is adjusted to provide an incentive for families that might otherwise be locked out of adoption due to cost, as well as "for families who really have to, maybe have a little bit of prodding to think about adopting across racial lines."
In other words, Norris explains, there are often altruistic reasons for the discrepancy — "but people who work in adoption say there's one more reason, quite simply: It's supply and demand."
The fees typically cover administrative costs, but also costs associated with taking care of the mother, like travel, rent, health care and counseling services. Now, some states and agencies are using a different formula to make adoption more affordable for families, with a sliding scale based on income rather than skin color. In that system, lower-income families pay less to adopt. Some agencies are also moving toward a uniform cost system where all adoptive parents would pay the same fees.
Ultimately, the Lantz family adopted their sons from Nevada, where the sliding scale was based on income, not race. But because they were eager to find a child, they did consider agencies that used a race-based cost differential.
During the process, the family received four calls about potential children to be matched with them — three from states that used this race-based cost structure. "One was a full African-American child, one was a biracial child and one was a white child," Lantz says. "And when they told me the fees for the white child, I was in a Babies R Us [store] and I remember having to sit down in the aisle and say to myself, 'I don't think we can afford to adopt this child if the expectant mother chose us.' "
The cost to adopt the Caucasian child was approximately $35,000, plus some legal expenses. "Versus when we got the first phone call about a little girl, a full African-American girl, it was about $18,000," Lantz says. The cost for adoption of a biracial child was between $24,000 and $26,000.
Eyes do linger on her blended family in her community, Lantz says, and curious people make comments. Two years ago, before she had a second son, she started growing concerned about the effect those comments might have on her son as he grows older.
"I am a little nervous about what we're gonna do when he starts to understand why someone approached us at Target and thanked us for saving babies," she explained at the time. "Or when a woman, you know, walks down the aisle of the grocery store and says, 'What's he mixed with?' "
Lantz responded to that incident, she recalls, by saying, "My son, we adopted him at birth. And, you know, his ethnic background is a little different. And we don't know a whole bunch about it, but he is a beautiful kid, isn't he?"
'White Parents Raise Beautifully Diverse Children'
That six-word submission to The Race Card Project comes from Louise Bannon of Holly Springs, N.C. Bannon and her husband Greg, both white, have two sons: Darius, Bannon's biological son, who is biracial, and Bryce, who is adopted and African-American. Bannon writes:

If you were to tell us that producers have decided to gamble on The Killing's still relatively unknown standout Joel Kinnaman to play the title role in the big-budget remake of Robocop, we'd simply laugh and say, “Okay, how far along into pre-production will this movie get before Warner Bros. executives say, ‘Wait, we cast WHO?' and decide to pull the plug on the project?” But since this movie is being made by MGM, maybe they'll actually do it! In any case, Deadline is reporting that Kinnaman has gotten the offer to topline the Jose Padilha-directed project, and we suspect he will accept, because if there's anything we know from The Killing, it's that Kinnaman loves projects where he only ever gets to wear one thing. Mazel tov!
In a rare Sunday session, the Senate advanced legislation that would set aside more than 2 million acres in nine states as wilderness. Majority Democrats assembled more than enough votes to overcome GOP stalling tactics in an early showdown for the new Congress.
Republicans complained that Democrats did not allow amendments on the massive bill, which calls for the largest expansion of wilderness protection in 25 years. But Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and other Democrats said the bill - a holdover from last year - was carefully written and included measures sponsored by both Republicans and Democrats.
By a 66-12 vote, with only 59 needed to limit debate, lawmakers agreed to clear away procedural hurdles despite partisan wrangling that had threatened pledges by leaders to work cooperatively as the new Obama administration takes office. Senate approval is expected later this week. Supporters hope the House will follow suit.
"Today is a great day for America's public lands," said the bill's sponsor, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M. "This big, bipartisan package of bills represents years of work by senators from many states, and both parties, in cooperation with local communities, to enhance places that make America so special."
The measure - actually a collection of about 160 bills - would confer the government's highest level of protection on land ranging from California's Sierra Nevada mountain range to Oregon's Mount Hood, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado and parts of the Jefferson National Forest in Virginia. Land in Idaho's Owyhee canyons, Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan and Zion National Park in Utah also would be designated as wilderness.
Besides new wilderness designations, the bill would designate the childhood home of former President Bill Clinton in Hope, Ark., as a national historic site and expand protections for dozens of national parks, rivers and water resources.
In Wyoming, the bill would limit further oil and gas leasing in the Wyoming Range. It would also protect 387 miles of rivers and streams in Snake River headwaters under the federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
Senate Majority Leader Reid said about half the bills in the lands package were sponsored by Republicans. Most had been considered for more than a year.
"I am happy that after months of delay we will finally be moving forward," Reid said.
The bill's chief opponent, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., denounced what he called Democratic bullying tactics.
"I am disappointed the Senate majority leader has refused to allow senators the opportunity to improve, amend or eliminate any of the questionable provisions in his omnibus lands bill," Coburn told fellow senators.
"When the American people asked Congress to set a new tone, I don't believe refusing to listen to the concerns of others was what they had in mind," Coburn said. "The American people expect us hold open, civil and thorough debates on costly legislation, not ram through 1,300-page bills when few are watching."
Coburn and several other Republicans complained that bill was loaded with pet projects and prevented development of oil and gas on federal lands, which they said would deepen the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
Environmental groups said the bill set the right tone for the new Congress.
"By voting to protect mountains and pristine wildlands, Congress is starting out on the right foot," said Christy Goldfuss of Environment America, an advocacy group. "This Congress is serious about protecting the environment and the outstanding lands that Americans treasure."
The controversial Japanese whaling industry, which has met fierce criticism and often combative oversea confrontations, is "effectively dead in the water" without large government subsidies says a new report by animal watchdog group, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw).
Breaking the story on the uneaten 'warehouses of whale meat,' the Guardian cites a new report, to be published Tuesday, which found that—despite a dramatic drop in whale meat consumption—the Japanese government continues to siphon millions from public tax dollars to keep the industry afloat.
Whale meat consumption has reportedly fallen to about 1% of its 1960s peak, with stockpiles of unsold whale meat topping 5 million kilograms.
According the report, despite this obvious glut, the Japanese government spent at least ¥30bn ($4.8bn) on whaling between 1987 and 2012, including last year's subsidies of ¥2.28bn ($366m) which were siphoned off from money budgeted for reconstruction from the 2011 tsunami.

"With growing wealth and modernisation, the people of Japan have lost their yen for whale meat," the report says. "Yet fisheries officials and other government figures continue to siphon off millions of taxpayer yen to prop up an industry that is effectively dead in the water."
An unnamed Japanese anti-whaling activist and volunteer with ocean conservationist group Sea Shepard says that, despite the significant drop in popularity, Japanese whaling continues primarily because of "greed and bureaucracy, and also because the Japanese, like any country, don't like being told what to do by other countries."
"The fisheries agency is using international opposition to whaling to build domestic support," said Patrick Ramage, the director of Ifaw's global whale program. "But I don't think that argument is selling any better than all that whale meat now sitting in warehouses."
The Truth About /r/Bitcoin And /r/btc
nopara73 Blocked Unblock Follow Nov 22, 2017
The fight between /r/Bitcoin and /r/btc features another plot twist. Yesterday /u/censorship_notifier committed a post, where he finally acknowledged the most recent vote manipulation attack against /r/Bitcoin. In this case, the attack implied both bots and hacked Reddit accounts and these were used to pump Bitcoin Cash. But his post was not about this. His post was accusing /r/Bitcoin moderators and Gregory Maxwell (/u/nullc) of being the ones who executed this attack. Against themselves.
This may sound ridiculous, and of course it is. I let you read the point by point rebuttal of /u/thieflar, if you are interested in this particular chapter. Rather, in this article I would like to go into how the hell did we end up here?
But before that, take some time to think about the following two concepts.
Middle Ground Fallacy
An informal fallacy which asserts that the truth must be found as a compromise between two opposite positions. This fallacy's opposite is the false dilemma.
What Wikipedia describes may be the most common trap, many Bitcoiners fell into. There is no need to further discuss it, if you are living in the Bitcoin World for a while now, chances are dozens of examples are coming to your mind in this very moment.
Well-Kept Gardens Die By Pacifism
The mini essay of Eliezer Yudkowsky is a true masterpiece, that perfectly describes how Internet communities die by refusing to defend themselves.
xkcd
Somewhere in the vastness of the Internet, it is happening even now. It was once a well-kept garden of intelligent discussion, where knowledgeable and interested folk came, attracted by the high quality of speech they saw ongoing. But into this garden comes a fool, and the level of discussion drops a little — or more than a little, if the fool is very prolific in their posting.
So the garden is tainted now, and it is less fun to play in; the old inhabitants, already invested there, will stay, but they are that much less likely to attract new blood. Or if there are new members, their quality also has gone down.
Then another fool joins, and the two fools begin talking to each other, and at that point some of the old members, those with the highest standards and the best opportunities elsewhere, leave…
But when the fools begin their invasion, some communities think themselves too good to use their banhammer for — gasp! — censorship.
/r/Bitcoin Before The Scaling Wars
“I created this meme on the price!”, “Oh, no! China banned Bitcoin again! That's actually good for Bitcoin, here's why!”, “Hey, my price analysis is 100% correct, look at the lines I drew!”, “My Blockchain.info account just got hacked:(“, “Hey here's my new project about a new, decentralized internet!”, “Much crypto, such coin, to da moon!”.
Was this community perfect? Hell no! But it was relaxing, often informative and always fun to check out. To some extent, today's /r/Bitcoin is similar to what we had back then, it got a more toxic, but not terrible. For a terrible subreddit example, check out /r/btc: 30% of the posts are toxic conspiracy theories on how /r/Bitcoin sucks, 30% of the posts are toxic conspiracy theories on how much Bitcoin developers suck, 30% of the posts are worshiping known scammers, fraudsters, con men and fake Satoshis. The rest is about positive initiatives on how to genuinely improve Bitcoin Cash. /r/btc is the true mirror of rotten, malign and ill-minded souls. It is likely how hell looks like.
So, can you blame /r/Bitcoin moderators for taking a heavy handed approach on moderation, in order to avoid their child turn into a shithole, like the other subreddit? Maybe. Maybe /r/Bitcoin's moderation policies were the very reason why the other sub turned out to be this way. However, as you'll see later, I will argue /r/Bitcoin moderators did not have a choice. The vote manipulation attack were so severe that, without moderation /r/Bitcoin would be the shithole of Bitcoin today. Not /r/btc.
The Shadow Of Menace
Back in 2014, Gavin Andresen got an idea. Let's roll out a new block size limit at 20MB! Other than Mike Hearn there was not a single developer who got behind his proposal. And instead of trying to find a scaling solution he decided to bypass the usual FOSS methodology to achieve consensus among developers, and started a blogging campaign.
Bitcoin XT
When that failed, they created Bitcoin XT, which was aiming for 8MB, and they elevated their campaign to new levels. Maybe it wasn't them, but in 2015 someone started the first vote manipulation attack against /r/Bitcoin to push Bitcoin XT. Things went so far that someone sent a message from Satoshi's email address, (as of today, the authenticity of the email has not been debunked), which made /u/theymos to take a step and impose temporary rules to crack down on the mess and just like this /r/btc was born.
Regardless if the email came from Satoshi, or not, it is a great summary of the situation back then. The content is instructive and it still rings true:
I have been following the recent block size debates through the mailing list. I had hoped the debate would resolve and that a fork proposal would achieve widespread consensus. However with the formal release of Bitcoin XT 0.11A, this looks unlikely to happen, and so I am forced to share my concerns about this very dangerous fork.
The developers of this pretender-Bitcoin claim to be following my original vision, but nothing could be further from the truth. When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement. Bitcoin was designed to be protected from the influence of charismatic leaders, even if their name is Gavin Andresen, Barack Obama, or Satoshi Nakamoto. Nearly everyone has to agree on a change, and they have to do it without being forced or pressured into it. By doing a fork in this way, these developers are violating the "original vision" they claim to honour.
They use my old writings to make claims about what Bitcoin was supposed to be. However I acknowledge that a lot has changed since that time, and new knowledge has been gained that contradicts some of my early opinions. For example I didn't anticipate pooled mining and its effects on the security of the network. Making Bitcoin a competitive monetary system while also preserving its security properties is not a trivial problem, and we should take more time to come up with a robust solution. I suspect we need a better incentive for users to run nodes instead of relying solely on altruism.
If two developers can fork Bitcoin and succeed in redefining what "Bitcoin" is, in the face of widespread technical criticism and through the use of populist tactics, then I will have no choice but to declare Bitcoin a failed project. Bitcoin was meant to be both technically and socially robust. This present situation has been very disappointing to watch unfold.
Satoshi Nakamoto
Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin 2X
Oh no, I'm losing an argument. Look over there CENSORSHIP!
The appearance of Bitcoin Classic also marks the beginning to the ruling of Roger Ver, The Liar. Around this time, he bought /r/btc and ironically started imposing censorship on /r/btc himself. He also got caught red-handed many times for vote manipulation, buying votes and twitter likes. In sum Roger Ver is most notable for paying millions in social media attacks against Bitcoin. He perfected his social media attacks, not only the only advertisement on /r/Bitcoin was about /r/btc, he constantly stickied /r/Bitcoin bashing posts to his subreddit, he created Bitcoin.com to push his propaganda, paid dozens of Reddit and Medium pseudonymous writers, who are constantly posting walls of spaghetti texts and so on.
Final Thoughts
So here we are in 2017, and you are demanding /r/Bitcoin moderators to silently sit back and watch how millions being poured into vote manipulation on their subreddit.
Meta
Sorry for not posting much these days, among all this drama I tried to concentrate on being productive and coding as much as I can. I implemented most of ZeroLink into HiddenWallet and I will soon release an experimental version on the testnet. This is the first high anonymity set trustless Bitcoin mixing that had been implemented, so please consider supporting it. Or not, I'm not a beggar.
A traditional handcrafted mat produced in the low-lying villages of Sylhet has been included in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, according to a Unesco press release. The art of making shital pati, which is woven together with strips of a green cane known as “Murta”, is one of the country's traditional practices and has been past down generation after generation. Men and women participate equally in the family-oriented production process, as it is a major source of their livelihood. The Representative List was announced during the 12th session of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage meeting in Jeju Island, South Korea, on Wednesday. The session will continue until December 9. A total of nine elements have been selected from Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Côte d'Ivoire and Cuba. [caption id="attachment_232417" align="aligncenter" width="800"] A shital pati maker is seen working on his new project[/caption] They identify forms of expression that testify to the diversity of the intangible heritage and raise awareness of its importance.The review of nominations will continue and further new titles will be added to the already reported list. They identify forms of expression that testify to the diversity of the intangible heritage and raise awareness of its importance. Since the mastery of making shital pati empowers underprivileged communities including women, the government promotes awareness though local and international crafts exhibitions. [caption id="attachment_232419" align="aligncenter" width="800"] Shital pati on display in an exhibition[/caption] In addition, the Shital Patri communities are increasingly being organized into cooperatives to ensure the efficient safeguarding and transmission of the craft, and guarantee its profitability. Safeguarding efforts involve a direct participation of the concerned communities, ensuring the craft is primarily transmitted from one generation to next, within the families.
Alonso was pitched in to the barriers on the opening lap of the Red Bull Ring race after Kimi Raikkonen lost control of his Ferrari and swiped into him on the opening lap.
The extensive damage to Alonso's car as he hit the barriers and ended up on top of Raikkonen was a particular blow to McLaren, because the Spaniard had been running the only new update package the team had for its car.
With the team open that this week's two-day in Austria, which begins on Tuesday, is important to help it move forward, it is now pondering how best to approach things in light of the damage Alonso has sustained.
Motorsport.com has learned that although much of the new update package was destroyed in the crash, the team believes that it can get a new version of its nose cone, front wing and rear wing ready for the test – although this may not be possible until Wednesday.
There is a chance, therefore, that McLaren will swap around its plans – with test driver Stoffel Vandoorne now running on the first day and Alonso replacing him on Wednesday, which will give the team an extra 24 hours to fly out new parts.
A final decision on the matter is expected later on Monday.
A TEENAGER was struck and killed by another driver as he changed a flat tyre in the centre lane of a major western Sydney road this morning.
Emergency services were called to James Ruse Drive in North Parramatta just before 11am to reports a pedestrian had been struck by another vehicle.
Paramedics raced to the scene and treated the 19-year-old from Wentworthville, but he couldn't be revived.

A white ute could be seen in the centre lane with a spare tyre on the road next to it, the man's body covered by a white cloth metres away.
It's unclear why the driver decided to change flat on the road rather than pull into the emergency lane available on the road.
The driver of the car that struck the man — a 41-year-old Turramurra man — stopped after the accident and is co-operating with police.
He was taken to Westmead Hospital for mandatory blood and urine tests.
James Ruse Drive was closed northbound as police crash investigators examined the scene.
Investigators are asking for any witnesses who have not yet come forward to contact police.
Police said they especially want to hear from an Asian woman, who was wearing a blue top, as she was travelling in a nearby vehicle ahead of the collision and may have more information.
A report will be prepared for the coroner.
If you have any information, phone Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

NEW YORK (AP) — A suburban New York house owned by former KISS lead guitarist Ace Frehley has gone up in flames.
The Journal News reports that firefighters were called to the stone house in the town of Yorktown Heights late Saturday morning.
The home was heavily damaged, with flames burning through the roof.
The newspaper says the musician had been fighting foreclosure on the property in Westchester County Court.
The Red Cross helped a resident with emergency lodging. A neighbor says a caretaker had been living in the home.
It was not clear where the 62-year-old founding member of the famed rock band was at the time of the blaze.
He played with the group until 2002, during what was billed as their farewell tour.

While the White House Correspondents' Association held its annual dinner last night, Full Frontal host Samantha Bee threw her own event, Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and used sketches based on The Man in the High Castle, The West Wing, and SNL to lambaste the Trump administration.
The most elaborate of the sketches came from Amazon's The Man in the High Castle, an alternate history show set in a timeline in which Japan and Germany won the Second World War. In it, Bee receives a film reel from a frightened George Takei, which turns out to be a video of an alternate timeline in which Hillary Clinton won the election in November, and in which Bee hosted the White House Correspondents' Dinner. (William Gibson had a similar idea for his upcoming science fiction novel.)
There were parodies from other television shows as well. Allison Janney opened the evening by reprising White House Press Secretary C.J. Cregg from The West Wing, who contended with a briefing room full of alt-right Breitbart bloggers, radical survivalists, and Skype reporters. Will Farrell also stopped by to bring back his George W. Bush impression from Saturday Night Live.
Bee used all three shows roast the Trump administration for things like changes in the White House briefing room, hiring relatives for key administration positions, and even the nostalgia that some have felt for George W. Bush's time in the Oval Office.
The White House Correspondents' Dinner typically sees the White House press corps, celebrities, and administration staffers mingling in an evening of humor directed at the sitting president. Hasan Minhaj of The Daily Show hosted this year's event, poking fun at some of the same things (dropping his own topical references). While most presidents have attended, President Donald Trump elected not to attend this year, opting instead to hold a rally in Pennsylvania.

Java enums will be enhanced with generics support and with the ability to add methods to individual items, a new JEP shows. Since both features can be delivered with the same code change, they are bundled together in the same JEP. The change only affects the Java compiler, and therefore no runtime changes are needed. Although there is no target version, Java 10 seems likely.
The change didn't initially get a postive reaction, with prominent Java Champions like Joshua Bloch questioning its usefulness. However, some further discussion and the presentation of new uses cases helped it gain support.
In case you didn't see my resp to @BrianGoetz, I now see the point of the JEP and withdraw my objections. Use case:https://t.co/O1tJO8oSCp — Joshua Bloch (@joshbloch) December 7, 2016
Let's now show what the changes would allow the developer to do by summarising some of the use cases presented in the JEP and other discussions. Java Champion Lukas Eder presented a StackOverflow question that introduced a case for retrieving and setting properties from a config file, web session, or similar, in a type-safe manner. An enum with generics support would allow us to indicate the set of available keys together with their associated type:
public enum Key<T> { HOST<String>, PORT<Integer>, SCORE<Double> } public interface PropertiesStore { public <T> void put(Key<T> key, T value); public <T> T get(Key<T> key); }
Now these keys can be safely retrieved and stored from and into the properties store, since expressions like the following will fail to compile:
put(PORT, “not a number”); // error, type mismatch: PORT is Key<Integer> // “not a number” is String
On the other hand, allowing individual items to have their own methods can help define operations that apply only to certain properties. Under JEP 301, the above definition could be expanded as follows:
public enum Key<T> { HOST<String>, PORT<Integer>, SCORE<Double> { double normalise(double x) { // score normalisation logic return result; } } }
With the current enums, all the items would have the generic type Key , which means the method normalise wouldn't be visible. However, after this work is finished, the compiler would preserve this kind of information, which means the following would be true:
SCORE.normalise(5.37); // compiles HOST.normalise(5.37); // error: neither HOST nor Key have normalised
The way to accomplish this will be by changing how the exposed static type of the individual items of the enum is calculated. As the reader may know, enums were added in Java 5 as mere syntactic sugar: the JVM doesn't have any special treatment for enums, instead, the compiler translates an enum into a normal class with static objects, and then compiles this into bytecode. Putting aside some technical aspects, the following enum:
public enum Colour { RED, GREEN, BLUE }
Is roughly translated by the compiler to the following (this isn't an accurate representation, but it's close enough for the purpose of this explanation):
public class Colour extends Enum { public static final Colour RED = new Colour(); public static final Colour GREEN = new Colour(); public static final Colour BLUE = new Colour(); private Colour() {} }
Since the type of all the items is Colour , any item-specific method or type information is lost. What JEP 301 will do is identify the cases where using the generic enum type is not enough to represent the individual items, and in such cases generate further, more specific types like Colour$RED , Colour$GREEN and Colour$BLUE .
Enhanced enums may benefit even further from other work being currently carried out in other parts of the JDK. On one side, local variable type inference might allow developers to get hold of the sharper types created by the compiler even though the exact form of these is unknown at the time of writing code; this would mean that, considering the code above, the following would be possible:
var s = Key.SCORE; // type of s derived as Key$SCORE s.normalise(8.29); // method normalise can be accessed
On the other side, anecdotical evidence and sample use cases suggest that generics in enums might be extensively used with primitive types, which is rather inefficient (the JVM has to use the boxed counterpart for each primitive type). This could be improved with the part of Project Valhalla that deals with Generics over Primitive Types, removing this barrier and making it available for mass utilisation.
Update: About Sharper Types
First, credit where it's due: The Atlanta Falcons had a combined 10-22 record the last two seasons, and its defense was so appalling that Arther Blank installed a new head coach to make them “tougher”. Most projections had their record this year somewhere between 5-11 and 7-9. Now, with their 25-19 OT victory over the Redskins on Sunday, Atlanta sit 5-0 and, barring a total collapse, should cruise into the playoffs.
Good job, Falcons!
Matt Ryan is just a notch below the league's very best. Julio Jones is a monster, Devonta Freeman is a welcome surprise, and under head coach Dan Quinn, the Falcons are moving in a positive direction. All of that remains, but the truth remains that their 5-0 record is undoubtedly the most deceptive in the NFL.
Only one of the five teams the Falcons have beaten this season have a winning record. Looking ahead, just two of the remaining eight teams left on their schedule — the Carolina Panthers and the Indianapolis Colts — have won more games than they've lost.
And it's not as though the Falcons have won any of those games convincingly.
Atlanta raced to a 20-3 first half lead against the Eagles in week one only for its defense to totally capitulate. It took a late fourth quarter comeback to prevent them from dropping to 0-1. Eli Manning gifted them a victory in week two, and the defense struggled to contain Brandon Weeden in week three. On Sunday, playing once again at the Georgia Dome after an easy win over the atrocious Houston Texans, Atlanta allowed Kirk Cousins to march down the field late in regulation and relied on a pick-6 in overtime.
Kirk Cousins to Robert Alford. Walk-off pick six in overtime…FOR THE WIN! #WASvsATL http://t.co/aN5UdvEvnC — NFL (@NFL) October 11, 2015
Nowhere are the margins between winning and losing thinner than in the NFL, and it's tough to be too harsh on a team that's racking up wins. But suggesting that this Falcons team is anything more than average is a stretch. Their defense — the unyielding problem for the better part of the last six seasons — is still comprised of many of the same players as last season. It's why the Falcons defense ranks 21st in the league in total defense despite their easy stretch of games.
The Falcons will continue reaping the benefits of an absurdly easy schedule, but the bottom will fall out sooner rather than later. This was and remains a transitional year for the franchise, everything else is just a red herring.
Sequester-proof.
(CNSNews.com) – The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded $1.5 million to study biological and social factors for why “three-quarters” of lesbians are obese and why gay males are not, calling it an issue of “high public-health significance.”
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Mass., has received two grants administered by NIH's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to study the relationship between sexual orientation and obesity.
“Obesity is one of the most critical public health issues affecting the U.S. today,” the description of the grant reads. “Racial and socioeconomic disparities in the determinants, distribution, and consequences of obesity are receiving increasing attention.”
“[H]owever, one area that is only beginning to be recognized is the striking interplay of gender and sexual orientation in obesity disparities,” it states.
Hiroki Kuroda is going home.
The 39-year-old starting pitcher will return to Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, according to reports from media there. The decision all but solidifies the Yankees' starting rotation heading into spring training.
The club had been waiting for Kuroda to say whether he would return for his eighth major-league season, and his fourth in pinstripes; retire; or return to Japan to pitch. He repeated declined to address his plans throughout 2014.
Kuroda finished his big-league career 79-79 with a 3.45 ERA, making him one of the best pitchers to leave NPB for America. He spent his first four years with the Doddgers (41-46, 3.45 ERA) before taking three separate one-year deals with the Yankees (38-33, 3.44 ERA), each time weighing whether he wanted to continue to pitch in the U.S.
The right-hander's career seemed to tail off at the end of 2013, but he rebounded under manager Joe Girardi's pitch and inning control in 2014, going 11-9 with a 3.71 ERA in 199 innings.
Kuroda's decision likely didn't surprise the Yankees. Their general manager, Brian Cashman, had repeatedly said he would be surprised if Kuroda didn't pitch in 2015.
But the team appeared either to have a sense that Kuroda wouldn't return or got to a point where they couldn't expect his presence going forward when they traded for Nathan Eovaldi and signing Chris Capuano to a one-year, $5-million deal.
Without Kuroda, the Yankees' Opening Day starting rotation projects as follows: Masahiro Tanaka, Michael Pineda, CC Sabathia, Eovaldi and Capuano. Ivan Nova will also join the rotation, but he's not expected to return from rehabbing post-Tommy John surgery until either late May or June.
Kuroda's agent, Jim Murray, didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.

Remote sensing, the practice of gathering information about objects without being physically near them, has had many practical uses for humans over the last few decades. Satellites in particular are remote sensing devices that have a large variety of functions. They have been used to predict and monitor the weather, enable communications around the globe, track changes in the Earth from space, and enable people to navigate to the nearest grocery store. The use of remote sensing in satellites can be also be used to help improve the lives of people in the poorest regions of the globe.
Data from satellites is being used by the International Fund for Agricultural Development to help combat poverty and support food production. One of those nations benefiting from remote sensing is Niger, a landlocked African nation struggling with food production. Niger is located in West Africa on the edge of the Sahara Desert and only less than four percent of the land is suitable for growing crops. Since the country is also prone to drought, food security is a major problem for the 17 million people who live there. On top of that, the country's gross domestic product is heavily dependent upon livestock production. The trading of livestock occurs mainly through traditional networks and local markets but nomadic pastoralism is also widespread and a source of income for the people.
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has been using satellites in order to support the small rural producers of Niger as well as working to guarantee food security. The IFAD is an agency under the United Nation created in the 1970s in order to encourage agricultural production as a way of combating poverty in developing countries. In Niger, the IFAD is working in the Aguie Department in the southern part of the country to monitor nomadic pastoralism. These herders often come into conflict with farmers over the use of the land and scarce water resources.
The IFAD monitors pastoralism by using maps that have been created from high-resolution satellite data. This data covers elements like land use, changes in the land, livestock routes, water points, and grazing lands. The maps are prepared by a team from GAF, a provider of geo-information. These teams are focusing on and analyzing the network of land corridors that pastoralists use. The hope is that this information on livestock movement will help the IFAD with project planning and agricultural development, specifically the cross-border transfer of animals, livestock markets, and water and forage supplies. The maps can also help the IFAD with implementing regional and local decisions like where to build roads and place markets.
Niger is not the only country that stands to benefit from economic development through the use of satellite data. The European Space Agency (ESA) has also been cooperating with the IFAD in order to support agriculture in the African nations of the Gambia, Botswana, and São Tomé. Plus, the ESA hopes that their new Sentinel satellites will improve the availability of environmental information over the next few years. This data can expand the capacity of agencies like the IFAD and others to help developing countries across the globe.

A group of Icelanders are aiming to have the country brought under the administration of the Norwegian government as “Norway's 20th county”.
The group in question, Fylkisflokkurin (“The County Party”), already has just over 1,200 members at the time of this writing.
The group, formed by director of the National Center of Addiction Medicine (SÁÁ) and former Fréttablaðið editor Gunnar Smári Egilsson, purports in their mission statement that they aim for “the re-uninfication of Iceland and Norway”, wherein “the Norwegian government would constitutionally protect and promote Icelandic culture while Icelanders would enjoy all the same rights as Norwegians.”
“Iceland is just too small to raise up talented politicians,” Gunnar elaborated. “It is also too small to raise and nurture properly talented people.”
Gunnar also compiled a list of Icelandic institutions, and their costs in tax money, that could be brought under Norwegian administration and ease the financial burden they place on Iceland.
The Icelanders who have joined the group have contributed to a lively discussion of the idea. Icelandic artist Jón Óskar speculated on what Iceland's flag would look like. Another Icelander wondered if the Norwegians would accept Iceland as a 20th county, while Pirate Party MP Birgitta Jónsdóttir said she supports the idea and has in fact supported it “for a few years.”
As many readers might know, most of the first settlers to Iceland hailed from Norway, and the two countries enjoyed a shared Nordic culture. Iceland was officially brought under the rule of Norway in 1262 until 1380, when the Danish-led Kalmar Union went into effect.
No response from Norwegian officials has been reported at the time of this writing.
It's been about a year since I revealed the first userland Vita exploit and I still occasionally get messages asking “what happened” (not much) or “when can I play my downloaded games” (hopefully never) or “I want homebrew” (me too). While I don't have anything new exploitwise (same problems as before: no open SDK, lack of interest in the development community, lack of time on my part), I do want to take the time and go over why it's taking so long.
Where are the hackers?
A common (and valid) complaint I hear is that there is a lack of hackers (a word I hate) working on the Vita. The fail0verflow team has a great post about console hacking that applies just as well to the Vita. In short, there isn't as much value to hacking a console now than before. Not too long ago, the PSP and DS were the only portable device people owned that plays games and, for many people, the only portable device they owned period. I had a DS Lite that I carried everywhere long before I had a smartphone. But then I got a smartphone (and so did everyone else). iPhones and Androids (and don't forget Windows Phone) are the perfect platform for what we used to call homebrew. Indie developers who wanted to write a portable game no longer has to use a hacked PSP and an open SDK. Writing apps is much easier and much more profitable. Meanwhile users can play all the emulators they want on their Android phone or their jailbroken iPhone. The demand for hacked consoles shrunk dramatically with those two audiences gone. Plus with smartphones gaining a larger audience while the Vita barely sells (which by the way is a tragedy since it's a pretty awesome console), a hacker can get a lot more attention (for for those who seek “donations”, a lot more money) spending time rooting phones that are coming out every month.
But [insert device here] was hacked very quickly, we just need more people working, right?
To some extent, that is true, but even with a large group of talented reverse engineers, I would not bet that the Vita would be hacked any time soon. To be clear here, when I say “hacked,” I refer to completely owning the device to the point that decryption keys are found and unsigned code can be run in kernel mode (or beyond). The problem is that even talented reverse engineers (who can read assembly code and find exploits) are out of luck when they don't have the code to work with. I mentioned this circular problem before, but to restate it: you need to have access to the code before you can exploit it, and to get access to the code, you need to exploit it. But, if that's the case, you ask, how would any device ever be hacked? That is why I believe that the first (real) hack of any device is the most important. Let's look at some examples of “first hacks” and see why it doesn't work with the Vita.
Insecure First Version
This is the most common situation. Let's look at the PSP. The 1.00 firmware ran unsigned code out of the box. Someone found a way to access the filesystem, and saw that the kernel modules were unencrypted. They analyzed the kernel modules and found an exploit and owned the system. All it takes is to have an unreleased kernel exploit from one firmware version; then update to the next one; exploit it and dump the new kernel to find more exploits. Rinse and repeat.
Same with the iPhone. The first version(s) allowed you to read from the filesystem through iBoot. It was a matter of dumping the filesystem, analyzing the (unencrypted) binaries, and creating exploits. Plus, the kernel is from the same codebase as OSX, so analyzing it was not as difficult as looking at a new codebase.
The Vita however, has a fairly secure original firmware. No filesystem access (even to the memory card), proper encryption of things that do come out of the device, and very little areas of interaction in general (you have CMA and that's pretty much it).
Similarities to other Devices
Most Android phones fall into this category. One Android root will most likely work across multiple manufactures. Plus, Android is open source, so it's a matter of searching for an exploit. Once the device is rooted, someone has to find a way to dump the bootloader (which for many phones is just a matter of reading from a /dev/ endpoint), and analyze the bootloader for a way to root it.
The Kindle Touch (which I was the first to jailbreak), ran essentially the same software as the Kindle 3 and had a debugging console port.
The Vita has similarities to the PSP, but most of the system is different. With multitasking support, the Vita memory model is completely different from PSP and has proper abstraction of virtual memory. The Vita has NetBSD code, but the kernel is completely proprietary. No PSP exploit will work on the Vita.
Hardware Methods
This is usually the “last resort” because it takes the most skill and money to perform. This usually involves physically dumping the RAM with hardware to analyze the code. The most recently hacked console, 3DS had this done. I believe the first Wii hack was developed with a hardware RAM dumper. Many consoles had some kind of hardware analyzing done before the first hack is developed.
It would be very hard to do a hardware hack on the Vita. The system memory is on the same chip as the CPU, so you cannot try to piggyback the RAM. Plus anyone doing a hardware hack would have to have expert electrical engineering skills and access to expensive tools.
The story always starts with getting access to the code, then finding an exploit, and then using that exploit to get more code to find more exploits in the future. Most of the jailbreaks, roots, and hacks you see are developed with information gathered from a previous hack. I believe that Sony knows this and really made sure that their device does not suffer any of the flaws I listed. Lots of people make fun of Sony for not handing security well, but after spending countless hours on the Vita, I could honestly say that the Vita is one of the most secure devices I've ever seen. So far, they seem to have done everything well; using all the security features in modern computers and not trusting any code. But, as we learned countless times, nothing is completely secure.
EDIT: I'm seeing a lot of comments speculating that Vita slim or Vita TV may help hacking it. In my opinion, this is grasping at straws. There are no evidence that a minor revision of the console will magically create software or hardware holes.
By now, the offensive question has become so familiar it's basically routine.
A woman is sexually assaulted; her agency, body, and selfhood violated. Yet, time and time again, the response to such an obtrusive act of physical or psychological violence often uttered by friends, family, university administrators or others who should know better, is: "Well, what were you wearing?"
For her thesis project at Arcadia University, photography major Katherine Cambareri decided to challenge the ease with which people resort to victim blaming. "Over the summer I read Missoula written by Jon Krakauer, which really got me heated about how unfairly sexual assault cases are handled," the artist explained to The Huffington Post. "This book really opened my eyes to victim blaming and the questions victims are asked, such as if they were drinking and what they were wearing at the time the assault occurred."
"Questions like this are asked to protect the perpetrator rather than the victim," she continued. "I find it asinine that survivors are sometimes blamed before they even have the chance to tell their stories. I wanted to do something to prove how unnecessary these victim-blaming-type questions are."
Kat Cambareri
For her photo series, Cambareri reached out to survivors of sexual assault on Facebook, asking them to bravely share instances in which they experienced sexual advances without their consent. Only female college students responded to the request, thus narrowing the scope of the project. Cambareri then asked the women if she could photograph the clothes they were wearing when they were assaulted.
The items of clothing Cambareri photographed include a white V-neck T-shirt, grey sweatpants, a plaid button-down, white Converse sneakers, and a floral camisole. Placed eerily against a black backdrop, the lightly rumpled garments scream silently of the injustices approximately 23 percent of female students at American universities are not only forced to endure, but sometimes held accountable for.
"Society assumes that victims wear revealing clothing when they are sexually assaulted," she said. But as her images attempt to show, that's not only an inaccurate assumption, it's a harmful one that downplays the fact that the person at fault is always the perpetrator, and never the victim of assault.
Kat Cambareri
Throughout the process, Cambareri's greatest fear was that she was asking too much of survivors, asking them to relive such painful experiences. But in the end she felt confident the positive impact of the project -- and the consent of her volunteers -- made the photos worthwhile.
"I feel like I have a special connection with each of the volunteers because by participating, they're trusting me with the fact that they have been sexually assaulted," Cambareri explained in an interview with Break the Cycle. "They're trusting me to use their clothing in a positive way. Everyone that's participated so far has been an acquaintance of mine and that goes to show what a large problem this is. As a person, it makes me realize that so much needs to be done in terms of prevention; we need to stop stereotyping and surrounding sexual assault with so many stigmas."
Cambareri hopes to continue her project after graduation, and seeks to include more men in the project as well. For now, however, she simply wants her work to be seen, digested and understood, even if the experience is a painful one.
"I really, really hope to make people uncomfortable looking at these images," she added. "I want people to think about victim blaming and how asking 'What were you wearing?' is not a valid question because victims never 'ask' to be assaulted. Sexual assault occurs because a person decided to assault another person, and for no other reason."
"I hope that viewers are able to trade places and imagine themselves wearing the items of clothing I've photographed," she concluded. "It is important for people to gain new perspectives to end stigmas and break stereotypes."

Two central Iowa police departments' latest spring outreach campaign, involving a stereotypical sweet treat, is drawing some serious attention on social media.
"Spring is always a time about new beginnings," said Eric Snyder, community resource officer at the Ames Police Department. "The message this year is respect."
Along with the help of the Iowa State University Police Department, the two law enforcement agencies are teaming up to positively impact students and the city of Ames. Snyder said with everything that has gone recently in Iowa as well as the country, the goal of this campaign "is to bring people back together."
"Respect is a very basic message anytime you want to do it," he explained. "Respect is cross-cultural."

So why doughnuts?
Snyder said that the Ames Police Department posted an April Fool's Day video part of its Quick Tips series — 30-second clips that are meant to inform people. Snyder called that video "very basic," but it resonated well online and had thought they could bring that idea back for the new campaign.
That video drew 7,000 views. And most of the time, the police department's videos average between 5,000 to 10,000 views, Snyder said.
But its latest video, however, has already surpassed the standard. As of 11 a.m. Wednesday, after being published earlier Monday, it has over 394,000 views, 4,100 shares and 3,000 likes.

Starring Snyder as well as Anthony Greiter of the ISU Police Department, the video starts out with the pair sitting at a table, munching on doughnuts and providing more information about the campaign.
"Watch social media for events as they pop up the rest of the month to get free doughnuts from the police," Greiter says midway through the clip, with a mouthful of doughnut.
What's the catch? It's simple.
"All we ask is that you donut disrespect, donut discriminate, donut harass and donut hate," Snyder says in the video while chowing down.
WATCH:The hilarious outtakes
Some of the video's 110-plus comments include:
From the West Liberty Police Department: "Mic drop — You won the Internet today. Well played."
From Sarah Anne Martin: "No clue where Ames is but I'm over here laughing in Benbrook, Texas! Super cute video! Send donuts."
From Amanda Cherry: "You all make me wish I still lived in Iowa! And cop donuts are way better than regular donuts … because cop donuts are justice nice!"
Snyder added that even though the social media attraction the latest clip has received, he said it still bottles down to always being genuine and keeping the community they police departments represent and serve in mind.
"Yeah I want it to be well-received, but I'm more blown away about by how popular it's been," Snyder said.

Snyder said that he writes scripts for the videos while sitting in his office. The police departments shared an outtakes video Tuesday afternoon, which as of 11 a.m. Wednesday, has more than 31,000 views and 330 shares.

Google has agreed to pay the UK £130 million (roughly $185 million) in back taxes. The deal covers the company for the past decade, and comes after a years-long investigation by the government's tax agency, HMRC, into the search firm's accounting practices in the UK.
The figure applies future tax policies back to Google's earnings since 2005, plus interest. Under the deal, Google is now paying taxes on revenues from advertisers in the UK. Previously, the search company — like many other large multinational firms — was able to avoid taxes on much of that revenue by routing it through countries with low taxes. Companies like Apple and Amazon have been criticized for employing similar legal practices to reduce their tax burden. This system, for instance, allowed Google in 2013 to pay just £20.5 million UK taxes on £3.8 billion in revenue in the country.
Deal settles Google's tax obligations back to 2005
The British treasury has called the deal "the first important victory in the campaign ... to ensure companies pay their fair share of tax on profits made in the UK" as well as "a success for our new tax laws." Not everyone is pleased with the agreement however: opposition chancellor John McDonnell said it looked like a "sweetheart deal," noting that the settlement amount "is relatively trivial in comparison with what should have been paid."
For Google, the HMRC's investigation did not find that the company cheated on its taxes, and, importantly, the UK's so-called "Google Tax" will not be invoked. That means the company won't have to pay any penalties for diverting profits. In addition, according to the Financial Times, Google will retain its "double Irish" accounting policies — at least until Ireland closes that loophole.
The dark blue section would be a highway for drones delivering packages; the green area would be for local traffic. (Amazon)
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Amazon sparked interest in drones more than a year and a half ago when it revealed on “60 Minutes” a program to use drones to deliver packages within 30 minutes. Since then the Amazon Prime Air engineers have largely kept a low profile as they test their technology overseas.
But at a conference Tuesday attended by leading players in the burgeoning drone world, Gur Kimchi, vice president of Amazon Prime Air, shared the company's proposal for how drones could operate safely in cities, suburbs and beyond around the world.
“Imagine the Internet without HTTP and TCP/IP,” Kimchi said. “That's basically where we are now. So we're putting our foot down, and we'd like everybody to feel an urgent need to come together and create these standards and adapt them.”
He spoke at the NASA Ames Research Center, which is hosting hundreds of guests for a three-day conference to discuss an air traffic management system for drones.
Amazon suggests divvying up airspace access based on a drone's mission and capabilities. Drones would connect to an online network that manages their flights in real time to prevent any trouble. Amazon believes this approach will ensure safe and efficient drone flights.
Kimchi is calling for airspace under 200 feet to be designated for low-speed localized traffic. Drones in this space might be surveying, shooting videos or conducting inspections. Drones without the best collision-avoid technology would also be restricted to this level.
While that airspace would be like a local service road, between 200 and 400 feet would serve as a highway for drones. Most of these drones would be flying autonomously. A drone making a long commute to conduct a mapping operation or package delivery could speed along in airspace populated by drones only with the most sophisticated sense-and-avoid technologies. These drones would communicate with each other and be able to detect hazards not on the drone network, such as birds. The airspace between 400 and 500 feet would be left empty as a buffer between drones and planes.
Only drones with the best capabilities — such as technology capable of detecting and avoiding birds — would be allowed to fly in urban areas. Sense-and-avoid technology is critical as companies such as Amazon want their drones to fly autonomously, so a human won't be present to avert a collision with a pigeon, skyscraper or helicopters.
Kimchi sketched out one potentially dangerous situation, and how a network like the one Amazon envisions would prevent a mishap: What if a homeowner happens to be having a package delivered at the same time their real estate agent had planned to shoot a sales video of the home with a drone?
“The ground control station will present an alert. Maybe — it depends on the software — it will tell the operator what they can do: land, create a geofence so you stay on this side not the other side, remain under an altitude, whatever,” Kimchi said. “They accept the alert. They do the right thing; we can complete the mission. We take off again. The alert clears; both networks notify each other, and then they can complete the real estate photography.”
Kimchi also laid out his thinking on how autonomous drones could safely fly in the same locations as helicopters. Helicopters are much more problematic than planes for drones because of low-altitude flying.
“The helicopter can talk to air traffic control, which can then maybe draw a little rectangle around where they're flying and then say, ‘Hey this is a new no-fly zone; all drones please get away.' Because the system is all real time, this will be sent to all drones as an alert,” Kimchi said. “Even if the pilot doesn't do anything they still have sense-and-avoid. They'll see the pilot from a long time away and still disperse.”
Amazon thinks drones can fly safely in urban areas, provided they have an array of cutting-edge technologies, which are still being developed and tested by Amazon and others. It believes drones flying over cities should have geospatial data to avoid known hazards such as buildings; online flight planning and management; an Internet connection; sense-and-avoid that communicates with other drones, plus sense-and-avoid that uses sensors to detect unexpected obstacles such as birds.
Delivering packages via drones could be a boon for Amazon if it cuts its shipping costs and speeds up deliveries for customers.
Amazon expects that in the next 10 years the number of drone flights under 400 feet will dwarf the roughly 85,000 commercial, military, cargo and general aviation flights that happen every day in the United States. Given this projected growth, Amazon believes responsibility for traditional air services such as navigation and air traffic control must be delegated. It imagines a civil aviation authority having underlying authority, yet much of the air navigation being handled in a distributed fashion as drone operators manage their fleets. Amazon sees such a model working provided that all parties follow the same protocols.
Its vision is more ambitious than the FAA's proposed rules for commercial drone flight, which do not allow operation outside of a pilot's line of sight. Those rules are expected to be finalized within a year. Now we'll see if drone operators such as Amazon can demonstrate to the FAA and others that autonomous drones can safely fly in a range of environments. If that happens, the full potential of drones could be realized.
Starting in January 2017, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will require all of the research it funds to be published in a manner that is free for the public to read, according to a recent statement. The Gates Foundation rules are in conflict with current policies at many top journals such as Science, which generally charge for access for at least the first few months. Still, the organization has a lot of clout and may be able to push for more open access.
How the Gates Foundation is pushing for open access
The Gates Foundation spends about $900 million each year funding scientific research — which results in about 1,400 research papers on various aspects of global health.
Under the new policy, the researchers that the organization funds will only be able to publish papers that are immediately freely accessible to the public. That means that these scientists wouldn't necessarily be able to publish in top journals like Science that charge for access to its articles — unless these journals change their policies or open up those particular papers. And, since the Gates Foundation funds so much research, there will be pressure on these journals to do so (or else they'll lose out on potentially important papers).
More specifically, these rules will go into full effect by 2017. The articles will have to be free for anyone to use or build upon in any way, including for commercial purposes.
This open policy is more extensive than most major biomedical funders — including the US National Institutes of Health, which only requires results to be free a year after publication.
The Gates Foundation's policy is part of a growing movement called "open access," which promotes making research findings and data freely available to the public.
This is part of a trend toward open access
Researchers generally want their papers to be read by as many people as possible. But the journals that publish those papers are, in many cases, for-profit institutions — and they prefer charging for access.
Lately, however, the Open Access movement has been fighting to make more and more research free to the public. And they're succeeding. Here's a snapshot of what was freely available to the public in 2010, sorted by discipline:
(Policy Guidelines for the Development and Promotion of Open Access, UNESCO)
The big black line shows the percentage of papers in all subjects published between 1998 and 2006 that was freely available. But there's also great variation between different types of research. Topping the open list are mathematics, social sciences, and Earth sciences — each has 30 percent or more of its 2006 papers free. But compare that to clinical medicine, which is less than 5 percent.
Physics papers are more likely to be freely available — not so with clinical medicine
Some of this variation is because of different research cultures. For example, many physicists have been posting pre-publication manuscripts on a public website called arXiv since 1991, so it's not a surprise that physics (designated by blue crosses on the chart) also tends to have more of its peer-reviewed papers freely available.
By contrast, clinical medicine and biomedical papers were some of the least likely to be freely available — at least when this chart was made. One possible reason why? Many medical institutions are willing to pay big bucks for access.
It's worth noting that even that is changing, however. In 2008, the National Institutes of Health began requiring papers generated by the research it funded (which is taxpayer money) to be freely available to the public a year after publication or earlier. That's opened up a large chunk of biomedical research.
The chart comes from a 2012 UNESCO report on the practice of open access, which the organization strongly encourages as a way to spread knowledge and information worldwide:
Through Open Access, researchers and students from around the world gain increased access to knowledge, publications receive greater visibility and readership, and the potential impact of research is heightened. Increased access to, and sharing of knowledge leads to opportunities for equitable economic and social development, intercultural dialogue, and has the potential to spark innovation.

Update: This story was updated to provide more clarity about the specific requirements of the Gates Foundation's new policy.
8 years ago
(CNN) - Former President Jimmy Carter dismissed any notion that he has ill feelings toward the Tea Party movement.
"I don't have any criticism of the members of the Tea Party," Carter told CNN's Howard Kurtz in an interview on "Reliable Sources." "A lot of those same people, 30 years ago, were the ones who put me in the White House."
The former president did however, express concern about the movement's funding, while at the same time taking a shot at the recent Citizens United Supreme Court ruling on campaign spending and free speech.
"This Tea Party doesn't realize that they are financed by oligarchs, in the oil industry primarily - the Koch brothers and others," Carter said. "They've been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the political system... after what I call a stupid Supreme Court ruling last January."
As for election predictions, Carter wrote off the Democratic Party's chances of maintaining their majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's almost a foregone conclusion," Carter said. "I hope they (the Republican Party) won't get the Senate as well, I don't think they will."
When asked about President Obama's relationship with the press, Carter said cable news channels have changed the presidential news landscape, and did not mince words about Fox News.
"The discussion groups... on Fox News, are totally biased," said Carter. "They implant completely false images not only of facts about legislation that's passed or doesn't get passed, but also about the character of President Obama."
Carter has recently made appearances across the country to promote his new book, "White House Diary."
THE company that wants to establish a large-scale fracking industry in Scotland has warned that it could shelve its plans and instead invest in England, after the SNP leadership narrowly avoided an embarrassing rebellion over the issue from grassroots members.
Delegates forced a vote after a conference motion, which was watered down by party HQ ahead of the conference, was seen as not going far enough by members who support a ban on unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland rather than the current moratorium.
Following the debate, Tom Pickering, a director of Ineos who is spearheading the firm's fracking plans north of the border, expressed frustration at a timetable published by the Scottish Government for research and a consultation which means a final decision over the issue will not be taken until 2017.
He said that an attempt to engage with party members by holding a stall at the conference had gone well, but that Ineos, which owns the sprawling Grangemouth industrial complex, could instead focus its shale gas operations in England, where the UK Government is actively encouraging fracking.
Mr Pickering added: "If you're making an investment in something, clarity is absolutely important, from start until finish. Where you don't have that clarity, where are you going to take that investment? You'll take it where it has got clarity."
Asked about whether he feared the Scottish Government would be swayed by public opinion, rather than scientific studies it has commissioned, he added: "They've made the statement that they're working with fact and science."
On the Scottish Government's timetable for further research before a decision is made, he said he believed there "could be more pace" and expressed frustration at the time taken to set out the process.
Mr Pickering added: "They've said you can do seismic [testing] and core drilling, but actually that's not the path to testing commercial flow and production. Down south, we can see a clear line of science, regulatory support, planning support to advance it along the scientific and appraisal timeline.
"Ineos has got to think carefully about where it chooses to pursue early stage investment. [Scotland] could lose that first moment where you can choose to develop the knowhow and experience and equipment that can be taken out beyond Scotland. That once in a generation opportunity is lost."
In the conference hall, a series of delegates lined up to warn against the environmental and health impacts of fracking. Fergus Ewing, the energy minister, was not present at the event.
Eventually, a move to abandon the motion and force a stronger resolution in its place was defeated by 554 votes to 427.
Meanwhile, the leadership position was defeated over the issue of land reform, with delegates unhappy at the Scottish Government's proposals which will see tax exemptions for sporting estates scrapped and the creation of a new Scottish Land Commission. Several favoured more radical policies on transparency and buy-outs.
Almost 600 delegates voted to shelve the supportive motion and force a re-think, compared to 440 who opposed the move.
The Magic of Moss and What It Teaches Us About the Art of Attentiveness to Life at All Scales
“Attention without feeling,” Mary Oliver observed in her magnificent memoir of love and loss, “is only a report.” In Gathering Moss: A Natural and Cultural History of Mosses (public library) — an extraordinary celebration of smallness and the grandeur of life, as humble yet surprisingly magical as its subject — botanist Robin Wall Kimmerer extends an uncommon and infectious invitation to drink in the vibrancy of life at all scales and attend to our world with befitting vibrancy of feeling.
One of the world's foremost bryologists, Kimmerer is a scientist blessed with the rare privilege of belonging to a long lineage of storytellers — her family comes from the Bear Clan of the Potawatomi. There is a special commonality between her heritage and her scientific training — a profound respect for all life forms, whatever their size — coupled with a special talent for rendering that respect contagious, which places her prose in the same taxon as Mary Oliver and Annie Dillard and Thoreau. Indeed, if Thoreau was a poet and philosopher who became a de facto naturalist by the sheer force of poetic observation, despite having no formal training in science, Kimmerer is a formally trained scientist whose powers of poetic observation and contemplative reflection render her a de facto poet and philosopher. (So bewitching is her book, in fact, that it inspired Elizabeth Gilbert's beautiful novel The Signature of All Things, which is how I first became aware of Kimmerer's mossy masterwork.)
Mosses, to be sure, are scientifically impressive beyond measure — the amphibians of vegetation, they were among the first plants to emerge from the ocean and conquer the land; they number some 22,000 species, whose tremendous range of size parallels the height disparity between a blueberry bush and a redwood; they inhabit nearly every ecosystem on earth and grow in places as diverse as the branch of an oak and the back of a beetle. But beyond their scientific notoriety, mosses possess a kind of lyrical splendor that Kimmerer unravels with enchanting elegance — splendor that has to do with what these tiny organisms teach us about the art of seeing.
She uses the experience of flying — an experience so common we've come to take its miraculousness for granted — to illustrate our all too human solipsism:
Between takeoff and landing, we are each in suspended animation, a pause between chapters of our lives. When we stare out the window into the sun's glare, the landscape is only a flat projection with mountain ranges reduced to wrinkles in the continental skin. Oblivious to our passage overhead, other stories are unfolding beneath us. Blackberries ripen in the August sun; a woman packs a suitcase and hesitates at her doorway; a letter is opened and the most surprising photograph slides from between the pages. But we are moving too fast and we are too far away; all the stories escape us, except our own.
We, of course, need not rise to the skies in order to fall into the chronic patterns of our myopia and miss most of what is going on around us — we do this even in the familiar microcosm of a city block. Kimmerer considers how our growing powers of technologically aided observation have contributed to our diminished attentiveness:
We poor myopic humans, with neither the raptor's gift of long-distance acuity, nor the talents of a housefly for panoramic vision. However, with our big brains, we are at least aware of the limits of our vision. With a degree of humility rare in our species, we acknowledge there is much we can't see, and so contrive remarkable ways to observe the world. Infrared satellite imagery, optical telescopes, and the Hubble space telescope bring vastness within our visual sphere. Electron microscopes let us wander the remote universe of our own cells. But at the middle scale, that of the unaided eye, our senses seem to be strangely dulled. With sophisticated technology, we strive to see what is beyond us, but are often blind to the myriad sparkling facets that lie so close at hand. We think we're seeing when we've only scratched the surface. Our acuity at this middle scale seems diminished, not by any failing of the eyes, but by the willingness of the mind. Has the power of our devices led us to distrust our unaided eyes? Or have we become dismissive of what takes no technology but only time and patience to perceive? Attentiveness alone can rival the most powerful magnifying lens.
But the rewards of attentiveness can't be forced into manifesting — rather, they are surrendered to. In a sentiment that calls to mind Rebecca Solnit's spectacular essay on how we find ourselves by getting lost, Kimmerer writes:
A Cheyenne elder of my acquaintance once told me that the best way to find something is not to go looking for it. This is a hard concept for a scientist. But he said to watch out of the corner of your eye, open to possibility, and what you seek will be revealed. The revelation of suddenly seeing what I was blind to only moments before is a sublime experience for me. I can revisit those moments and still feel the surge of expansion. The boundaries between my world and the world of another being got pushed back with sudden clarity an experience both humbling and joyful. […] Mosses and other small beings issue an invitation to dwell for a time right at the limits of ordinary perception. All it requires of us is attentiveness. Look in a certain way and a whole new world can be revealed. […] Learning to see mosses is more like listening than looking. A cursory glance will not do it. Starting to hear a faraway voice or catch a nuance in the quiet subtext of a conversation requires attentiveness, a filtering of all the noise, to catch the music. Mosses are not elevator music; they are the intertwined threads of a Beethoven quartet.
Echoing Richard Feynman's iconic monologue on knowledge and mystery, Kimmerer adds:
Knowing the fractal geometry of an individual snowflake makes the winter landscape even more of a marvel. Knowing the mosses enriches our knowing of the world.
This knowing, at its most intimate, is a function of naming — for words are how we come to know meanings. Kimmerer considers this delicate dialogue between a thing's essence and its name:
Having words for these forms makes the differences between them so much more obvious. With words at your disposal, you can see more clearly. Finding the words is another step in learning to see. […] Having the words also creates an intimacy with the plant that speaks of careful observation. […] Intimacy gives us a different way of seeing, when visual acuity is not enough.
The remarkable diversity of moss varieties known and named only adds to the potentiality for intimacy with the world at all scales. But among this vast multiplicity of mosses is one particular species inhabiting the small caves carved by glaciers into the lakeshore, which alone embodies immense wisdom about the mystery and meaning of life. Kimmerer writes:
Schistostega pennata, the Goblins' Gold, is unlike any other moss. It is a paragon of minimalism, simple in means, rich in ends. So simple you might not recognize it as a moss at all. The more typical mosses on the bank outside spread themselves to meet the sun. Such robust leaves and shoots, though tiny, require a substantial amount of solar energy to build and maintain. They are costly in solar currency. Some mosses need full sun to survive, others favor the diffuse light of clouds, while Schistostega lives on the clouds' silver lining alone.
This singular species subsists solely on the light reflections emanating from the lake's surface, which provide one-tenth of one percent of the solar energy that direct sunlight does. And yet in this unlikely habitat, Schistostega has emerged as a most miraculous jewel of life:
The shimmering presence of Schistostega is created entirely by the weft of nearly invisible threads crisscrossing the surface of the moist soil. It glows in the dark, or rather it glitters in the half light of places which scarcely feel the sun. Each filament is a strand of individual cells strung together like beads shimmering on a string. The walls of each cell are angled, forming interior facets like a cut diamond. It is these facets which cause Schistostega to sparkle like the tiny lights of a far-away city. These beautifully angled walls capture traces of light and focus it inward, where a single large chloroplast awaits the gathering beam of light. Packed with chlorophyll ad membranes of exquisite complexity, the chloroplast converts the light energy into a stream of flowing electrons. This is the electricity of photosynthesis, turning sun into sugar, spinning straw into gold.
But more than a biological marvel, Schistostega presents a parable of patience and its bountiful rewards — an allegory for meeting the world not with grandiose entitlement but with boundless generosity of spirit; for taking whatever it has to offer and giving back an infinity more. Kimmerer writes:
Rain on the outside, fire on the inside. I feel a kinship with this being whose cold light is so different from my own. It asks very little from the world and yet glitters in response. […] Timing is everything. Just for a moment, in the pause before the earth rotates again into night, the cave is flooded with light. The near-nothingness of Schistostega erupts in a shower of sparkles, like green glitter spilled on the rug at Christmas… And then, within minutes, it's gone. All its needs are met in an ephemeral moment at the end of the day when the sun aligns with the mouth of the cave… Each shoot is shaped like a feather, flat and delicate. The soft blue green fronds stand up like a glad of translucent ferns, tracking the path of the sun. It is so little. And yet it is enough.
This tiny moss is a master of “the patient gleaming of light” — and what is the greatest feat of the human spirit, the measure of a life well lived, if not a “patient gleaming of light”? Annie Dillard knew this when she wrote: “I cannot cause light; the most I can do is try to put myself in the path of its beam.” And Carl Jung knew it when he insisted that “the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.” The humble, generous Schistostega illuminates the darkness of mere being into blazing awe at the miracle of life itself — a reminder that our existence on this unremarkable rock orbiting an unremarkable star is a glorious cosmic accident, the acute awareness of which calls to mind poet Mark Strand's memorable words: “It's such a lucky accident, having been born, that we're almost obliged to pay attention.”
To pay attention, indeed, is the ultimate celebration of this accidental miracle of life. Kimmerer captures this with exuberant elegance:
The combination of circumstances which allows it to exist at all are so implausible that the Schistostega is rendered much more precious than gold. Goblins' or otherwise. Not only does its presence depend on the coincidence of the cave's angle to the sun, but if the hills on the western shore were any higher the sun would set before reaching the cave… Its life and ours exist only because of a myriad of synchronicities that bring us to this particular place at this particular moment. In return for such a gift, the only sane response is to glitter in reply.
Gathering Moss is a glittering read in its entirety. Complement it with Annie Dillard on the art of seeing and the two ways of looking.
Cape Town – They share top spot with the All Blacks already anyway, but now the Nick Mallett-era Springboks look increasingly likely to lose their world record for most Test top-tier victories (17) on the trot.
The mighty, current New Zealanders are just four further wins away from setting a fresh benchmark all of their own, as they have stretched their own sequence to 14 triumphs after the 57-22 outcome against Argentina last Saturday.
It will probably be little comfort for South Africans at present that the embattled Boks do, at least, have two opportunities of their own to foul up the Black plans – Saturday's clash in Christchurch and then the home meeting with them at Kings Park on October 8.
The latter occasion seems a more realistic chance to fulfil that objective, as the Boks ought to be deemed in with a puncher's chance on home soil, even if they are still in the midst of widespread angst going into it.
Before that Durban encounter, the All Blacks must also safely negotiate their return fixture against the Pumas in Buenos Aires.
But if all goes to plan for them – and they must be branded favourites for both Bok matches and the one in South America – then the dead-rubber Bledisloe Cup match against Australia at Eden Park, Auckland, on October 22 will be the one where a win ensures they move to an historic 18 victories in succession.
The Springboks of 1997-1998 still stand at the top of the major-nation pile, although their 17 wins in a row is a feat shared with two previous All Black sides (1965-1969 and 2013-2014).
Sixteen of those Bok wins – including some really thumping ones -- were achieved under Mallett's guiding hand as coach, the lone exception being the first, which was Carel du Plessis's last game in the post when his otherwise rocky reign ended with a 39-point thrashing of the Wallabies.
But newly-appointed Sharks CEO Gary Teichmann was captain on each of the 17 occasions.
Here is a reminder, as an excuse for a pick-me-up for glum Bok supporters, of their now endangered golden, record run then:
August 1997: SA 61 Australia 22 (Pretoria)
November 1997: SA 62 Italy 31 (Bologna)
November 1997: SA 36 France 32 (Lyon)
November 1997: SA 52 France 10 (Paris)

SINGAPORE - Samsung Pay, the Korean electronics giant's e-wallet system, will launch in Singapore on June 16.
At launch, those holding Visa and MasterCard credit or debit cards issued by POSB Bank, DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank will be able to use a compatible Samsung phone to pay at almost all retail outlets that accept credit cards.
Singapore will be only the fifth country to have Samsung Pay. It was launched in South Korea last August, followed by the United States in September. In March this year, Samsung Pay made its debut in China, while it was launched in Spain just earlier this month.
"We are excited to bring this service to Singapore consumers and we hope to introduce value-added services to drive and lead innovation in mobile commerce," said Mr Thomas Ko, vice-president and global general manager of Samsung Pay.

Samsung Pay allows users to register their credit card details on selected Samsung smartphones with Near-Field Communication (NFC) wireless technology. Once registered, users can tap the phones for payment on almost all credit card payment terminals here.
Related Story Five major banks in Singapore now work with Apple Pay
This is because Samsung Pay uses a proprietary Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST) technology that works with both traditional magnetic-stripe credit-card terminals and NFC contactless payment terminals.
Related Story Apple Pay is the way to pay if you're an iPhone user
Unlike other contactless payment methods that are limited to transactions of $100 or less, Samsung Pay does not have this limit due to its MST technology.
Four Samsung Galaxy smartphones - the S6 edge+, Note 5, S7 and S7 edge - are compatible with Samsung Pay at launch. Fingerprint authentication is required for each transaction.
As of February this year, Samsung Pay has over five million registered users and recorded more than US$500 million (S$672 million) worth of transactions globally.
Rival mobile payment service Apple Pay was launched in April with support for American Express-issued cards only. But as of last month, Apple Pay also accepts Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards issued in Singapore from five major banks - POSB, DBS Bank, OCBC Bank, UOB Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
Apple Pay only works with contactless NFC payment terminals. This limits Apple Pay to only around 30,000 payment terminals in Singapore.
It also has a $100 cap for most transactions. But UOB has lifted this limit for some merchants, such as Singapore Petroleum Company, Caltex, Metro and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
One of the largest-ever implementations of the ethereum blockchain for a charitable cause has just concluded a successful trial.
Completed on 31st May, the project run by the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP) was designed to direct resources to thousands of Syrian refugees by giving them cryptocurrency-based vouchers that could be redeemed in participating markets.
As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the platform was successfully used to record and authenticate transfers for about 10,000 individuals. The platform was implemented by Parity Technologies, a startup led by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, and blockchain big data firm Datarella.
Alexandra Alden, a WFP innovation accelerator consultant who helped oversee the implementation, told CoinDesk:
“All funds received by the refuges from WFP were specifically used to purchase food items such as olive oil, pasta and lentils.”
The WFP is now in the process of gathering more detailed analytics, such as exactly how many transactions were conducted.
Extending the project
As reported by CoinDesk in early May, the WFP intends to expand the project to include 100,000 individuals in Jordan as soon as August. If that goes according to plan, the effort is set to grow to serve the entire Jordanian refugee population by the end of 2018.
Now Alden has confirmed to CoinDesk that the agency eventually hopes to implement the service beyond the borders of Jordan.
She explained:
“The plan is to expand the project pilot firstly across Jordan, but we are also evaluating use cases and potential applications in other regions.”
Currently, the agency is in talks with partners in the humanitarian and private sectors who can help it with its goal of achieving Zero Hunger by 2030, Alden said.
Notably, since the Jordan project was first initiated, the UN has revealed a wide range of blockchain projects being undertaken by other agencies under its umbrella.

Backbench Conservative MPs have blocked plans for a debate and vote on a bill to reverse private sector involvement in the NHS.
Green MP Caroline Lucas had sponsored the so-called NHS Reinstatement Bill, which campaigners say would roll back the health service's “internal market”, end contracting, and return the NHS to purely public provision.
The Bill is backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell in a private capacity, as well as by the SNP.
We'll tell you what's true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 $0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.
However despite scheduling on Friday the Bill did not receive a full debate because backbench Conservative MPs discussing a short bill to deport foreign criminals – which had already been debated before – used up available parliamentary time by talking for four and a half hours.
The Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill has only two clauses and would “make provision to exclude from the UK foreign nationals found guilty of a criminal offence committed in the UK.”
That Bill has already been introduced to the House in a previous session and withdrawn after it met opposition.
Ms Lucas raised a point of order an hour before the end of the discussion on deportation, arguing that the MPs were taking too long.
“Madame Deputy Speaker, is it within your power to suggest to the opposite benches that they do begin to bring their comments to a close?” she asked
“They have now been debating for three and a half hours on a two-clause Bill, a bill that was actually already debated last year and then withdrawn from the floor of the House.
“I think it does risk bringing this house into disrepute – there are so many people who want us to get onto the next business, the NHS, it is very important and I do think them talking for so long simply isn't courteous – either to the rest of the House or to the people outside this building who want to see what's going on.”
The Deputy Speaker replied: “She knows the answer to the questions she has put … I think she is voicing the frustrations that many honourable members have had on Fridays for private members' bills.”
Tory MPs who spoke at length on the deportation bill included Philip Hollobone, Sir Edward Leigh, Philip Davies, David Nuttal.
Tory backbenchers regularly “talk out” backbench legislation they do not like. Mr Davies has argued that such legislation can be badly designed.
He suggested that Ms Lucas moved a “cloture” motion to end the debate. These motions are difficult to bring on Fridays as they require large numbers of MPs, many of whom have returned to their constituencies.
After the conclusion of proceedings Ms Lucas tweeted: “Just tried – without success – to stop Tory backbench filibuster.
“Parliamentary process needs radical change – makes mockery of this place.”

Other bills that have been blocked by filibustering backbenchers since the election include one to remove hospital car parking charges for carers, one to ensure in law that rented homes are “fit for human habitation”, and one to mandate that children are trained in first aid at school.
Campaigners on a number of issues have recently called for Friday sessions – where private members' bill put by backbenchers are discussed – to be reformed.
A petition calling for changes to the way MPs can “filibuster” bills has gained over 33,000 signatures. If the petition reached 100,000 signatures it will be considered for debate in Parliament.
In a response to the petition, the Government said: “Procedure within the chamber is a matter for the House of Commons authorities and the Speaker or Deputy Speaker chairing the debate.”

Rory McIlroy is a huge fight fan (Picture: Getty)
Rory McIlroy is a massive Conor McGregor fan, but has admitted he worries the Irishman's super-fight with Floyd Mayweather may be ‘fixed'.
WBC confirm Deontay Wilder v Tyson Fury rematch is OFF and reveal why
McGregor will take on the undefeated Mayweather in Las Vegas this Saturday in what is expected to be the biggest fight ever in combat sports history.
On paper it is a match-up that can only go one way, but McGregor's flair and confidence has helped sell the fight as a legitimate contest to most observers.
McIlroy is a big fight fan and has met McGregor numerous times at UFC events and although he is in awe of McGregor's mindset, he mused that he and Mayweather could be taking the public for a ride.
‘Certainly that's all I've done is follow the build up to this thing,' McIlroy told reporters at the FedExCup Playoffs.

‘I'm intrigued. He talks a good game. If you just listen to his press conferences and what he says, you would think that this guy, he's the one with the 50-0 boxing record. It's amazing.
‘I'm a big admirer of him. He talks about visualization and the law of attraction and all this stuff that he believes in it and he vocalizes it, and he has the courage to say what he thinks.

‘I'm interested just to see how it all plays out, but I just fear that they do all this trash-talking and they go behind the scenes and they are having a laugh and thinking: I can't believe we are talking all this public for a ride.

‘It's amazing, like we were talking about, imagine McGregor knocks him out in the first couple of rounds. They would get even more for the rematch.
‘The rematch would be even bigger. So it's just – I just don't know what that zero on Mayweather's record is worth, and that's the thing. That's his legacy.

Lobbyists trying to influence EU policymakers will soon have to disclose details on their budget and methods, after the European Parliament approved tougher rules and called on the Commission to make the EU's lobby register mandatory by 2017.
With an overwhelming majority of 646 out of 667 votes cast, the European Parliament approved new measures that will make life more difficult for lobbyists who are not registered in the EU's transparency register.
Parliament will implement a new set of rules in order to encourage lobbyists to sign up. These include:
Restricting access to Parliament buildings for non-registered organisations;
Encouraging MEPs to get lobbyists with whom they meet, to sign up to the register;
Facilitating access to information for registered lobbyists, allowing them to co-host events in Parliament more easily and to participate in public hearings;
Restricting the Parliament's representation at events hosted by non-registered organisations.
Italian MEP Roberto Gualtieri (S&D), who is responsible for the update of the transparency register, called it “an important step forward”. He added that the new measures serve as “an incentive system, balanced by a requirement for high standards of transparency and behaviour from those who register.”
Parliament also pushes the Commission to take similar measures to urge interest groups to register.
On track to become mandatory
Both Parliament and interest groups have repeatedly called to make the Transparency Register mandatory, but this requires the consent of member states.
Though the EU Commission has dodged the issue in recent months, MEPs are now calling on the Commission to prepare a proposal by the end of 2016, which would make registration mandatory for Brussels-based interest groups.
In December, a joint working group of the European Parliament and the Commission completed a review of the Transparency Register, which included a roadmap to force member states into endorsing obligatory registration.
The European Commission's proposal will ask member states to unanimously support such a register, based on article 352 of the EU treaty. If they agree, the register could become mandatory by 2017. If not, a full review is scheduled in 2017.
Details need to be checked rigorously
Even with these efforts to make the register more robust, insiders have flagged a lack of scrutiny on the information lobbyists are providing.
Transparency watchdogs have flagged offenses and misinformation in the past, which slip through the cracks of the register's control.
The EU Parliament vice-president responsible for the review process, Rainer Wieland, told EURACTIV in an earlier interview that “if you want true policing – not just on the complaints or cases flagged by outsiders – you need more resources”. The need for more muscle was confirmed by sources in the register's administration
Register still growing
The register has grown considerably since it came into effect in June 2011. It now has around 6,000 entries, which makes up an estimated 75% of Brussels' business representatives and 60% of NGOs. The figure matches a rough number of 30,000 lobbyists in Brussels.
The EU's transparency register is one of a number of innovations, intended to strengthen transparency and openness in European policymaking.
Brussels is estimated to be the second largest city in the world for lobbyists, after Washington, although definitions of lobbying may vary. The EU has been looking at ways to incorporate stakeholders – NGOs, civil society and business representatives – in its decision making, while boosting efforts to increase transparency.

THE ROW OVER the appointment of Máire Whelan to the Court of Appeal persisted in the Dáil this evening, with the government again coming in for strong criticism from the opposition.
It was announced last Tuesday that Whelan would leave her post as Attorney General after six years, a day before Leo Varadkar took office as Taoiseach.
It was confirmed to Gavan Reilly of Today FM that she had not applied for the position.
The Cabinet approved Whelan's appointment this week, leading to much criticism from the Opposition. However, the government has insisted all correct procedures were followed.
The controversy rumbled on this week, with the government promising to quickly bring through new legislation on judicial appointments.
This has done little to satisfy the opposition, however, with another series of claims and counter-claims across the benches this evening.
“Suitable person… lawful process”
The new Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan spoke first.
The Minister said that the government appointed the best person for the job in Máire Whelan, as is its prerogative to do.
He said that he was surprised that experienced people were “bandying about information that x or y numbers of High Court judges may have expressed interest in the Court of Appeal vacancy”.
“Not only is that also covered by Cabinet confidentiality,” he said, “but, in fairness to any such member of the judiciary who had expressed such interest in respect of any such vacancy in the past, we are hardly going to lay out for political and public consumption the names and details of serving judges who have chosen to put themselves forward for more senior posts.”
He promised that the new bill was part of the government's aim of “entirely reforming the judicial appointment system”.
Tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald also provided a robust defence of the government's actions later on.
She said that she referred the vacancy to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board but it was “not in a position to recommend any applicant”.
Where others expressed interest in the role, she said: “While of course such expressions of interests are always considered, constitutionally the Government cannot be bound by any such expressions of interest in exercising its prerogative to advise the President on an appointment.
It is also in accordance with the law and the Constitution for the Government to nominate for appointment an eligible and qualified person who is not already a judge, even if there are existing judges who have expressed interest in the appointment.
To conclude I want to once again reaffirm what the Taoiseach said earlier – a suitable person was appointed by a lawful process.
“The government circumvented the law”
In response, Fianna Fáil Justice spokesperson Jim O'Callaghan dismissed the claim that Cabinet confidentiality prevented the answering of essential questions on the matters.
“There have been hundreds of judicial appointments,” he said. “Only two people were appointed having not gone through the proper process. This happened yesterday.
The reason the law was changed is because it is known there is political controversy when an attorney general seeks judicial office. The government circumvented the law. It is laughable to suggest they followed the correct procedures.
He asked a series of questions on who in Cabinet knew in advance of the decision to appoint Whelan, why did no one else in Cabinet say this was unusual and who decided that Whelan's name was the only one to be brought forward.
“This is a sorry saga, but the fault lies with government,” O'Callaghan concluded.
Questions for Fianna Fáil
Sinn Féin's Mary Lou McDonald, meanwhile, said that Micheál Martin – who wasn't present for the debate – had serious questions to answer based on a telephone call he had with the Taoiseach on the matter last Sunday.
She said: “The manner in which Máire Whelan was appointed bypassed the proper procedures for such appointments and we called on her to stand down in order to allow for a proper appointments procedure to take place.
Unfortunately, the Taoiseach had other ideas and he rushed through the trip to the park in order for Ms Whelan to receive the seal of office from the President.
“However, the revelation by the Taoiseach today of a phone call between himself and Deputy Martin on Sunday evening, in which Deputy Martin questioned Ms Whelan's suitability for the position, suggests that the Fianna Fáil leader was trying to influence this appointment,” McDonald said.
She questioned whether Martin attempted to use his influence on the government to prevent Whelan being appointed, and asked if he believes the confidence and supply agreement gives him the authority to have a say on who gets appointed to the bench.
McDonald says that the appointment “stinks to the highest of heavens” and that Martin is only concerned that it wasn't “his appointment”.
“He doesn't have the right legally or constitutionally to intervene in that way,” she said.
“Unfortunate saga”
Before Labour Leader Brendan Howlin spoke, he was interrupted by a Fianna Fáil member criticising the “smear” made against Micheál Martin by McDonald.
Howlin said that he had no doubt that Whelan would do an excellent job in her role. “But that does not mean that I think that the events that lead to her appointment to the Court of Appeals were in order,” he said.
“The lack of a transparent process was absolutely wrong,” Howlin said.
Howlin was similarly critical of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and also the Independent Alliance in his statement.
“Frankly, it has become embarrassing to hear Fianna Fáil's successive claims of outrage,” he said.
On the Independent Alliance, he said: “A year on in power, they still have little concept of how Cabinet Government works.
They clapped through an appointment that they now oppose.
He called for fundamental change to be brought in terms of legislation, and how such issues are approached in future to ensure that “some good will come from this unfortunate saga”.
“Not the right person”
Clare Daly said she wanted to “put a bit of balance on Howlin's earlier eulogising” by saying that Whelan was not the best person for the job and criticised the judge for her statements to the Fennelly report.
She said that it was a “red herring” to say that the appointment was illegal:
This was a political appointment. If it was the correct process, why are ye in such a rush to change it? … How you have the brass neck to defend it is beyond me.
Bríd Smith said that, “at worst, it is dishonest to the people of this country”. She suggested that Whelan step aside from her role before giving evidence on garda whistleblowers to the Charleton Tribunal, and then resuming it again.
Eamon Ryan heaped on the pressure, adding that “we need answers” and that there “are perfectly valid questions that haven't been answered yet”.
Mattie McGrath joked that Enda Kenny is probably sitting enjoying a drink or a cup of tea having left the new Taoiseach with a “nice mess”.
McGrath said he welcomed new legislation coming in, and got very heated on the matter.
“What about the ordinary people?” he asked. “Laws for the rich, but none for the poor. They have to take the medicine… These people [homeless] may be as well on death row waiting to get shelter.
The public are sick and tired of Fianna Fáil and the government… They haven't the courage or conviction to cause an election… The truth hurts.
This statement caused mayhem to erupt in the Dáil with McGrath warned by the Ceann Comhairle.
He replied “New politics, my foot.”
Question time
Affairs got heated again when the floor was opened for questions.
Sinn Féin's Jonathan O'Brien got into a war of words with Minister Charlie Flanagan, after asking how many others applied for the role.
When both looked to the Ceann Comhairle, he said it wasn't his responsibility if the Minister answered the question or not.
Brendan Howlin, similarly, got heated with Frances Fitzgerald.
On each occasion, the government ministers refused to say how many people applied to the role.
When Fitzgerald was asked who in the government put forth the name of Whelan alone to government, she said that “all applications that were in the system were considered in due process”.
When Fine Gael TD Colm Brophy attempted to interject on Fitzgerald's behalf, he was rebuked by the Ceann Comhairle.
The Ceann Comhairle angrily asked Brophy to withdraw the insinuation that he was denying government back benchers speaking time, which Brophy duly did.
A common theme from the opposition benches throughout this latter part was that Fitzgerald and Flanagan were refusing to directly answer their questions, who said on numerous occasions that the events at Cabinet were covered by Cabinet constitutional privilege.
As an equal of Simon Pegg's Tim, it's the ordinariness of Jessica Hynes's Daisy that makes her an enduring character.
I'm pretty sure everyone has a comfort TV show. You know, the one you tenderly take from the shelf after a bad day, with that warm feeling in your heart as its familiar menu screen loads up. Some things, no matter how many times you've seen them, never stop being amazing. This is how I feel about Spaced.
Spaced first aired in 1999, and was a brain child of comic geniuses Simon Pegg and Jessica Hynes. It was also directed by Edgar Wright and stars – amongst a cast of incredible British comedians – Nick Frost, in the role that got him involved with the whole acting thing. For anyone that knows of and adores the ‘Blood and Ice Cream Trilogy', this really is where the magic all began.
Daisy Steiner is not just perfectly written and portrayed by Jessica Hynes, but also one of the greatest female characters. Ever
It can be difficult to pinpoint why exactly you love a show, but I instantly felt a connection to the main characters of Tim (Pegg) and Daisy (Hynes). I loved how scruffy yet cosy their flat was. I liked how much tea they drank, and the way they would sometimes wear the same clothes for multiple episodes, like actual people would. Nothing was glamorous, and while, on the one hand, a massive part of the show is fantastical and hallucinogenic, with pop culture references thrown in, it still feels like the clearest portrayal of being in your 20s and, in particular, being a struggling creative and film nerd in your 20s.
Of all the characters though, Daisy Steiner is not just perfectly written and portrayed by Jessica Hynes, but also one of TV's greatest female characters. Ever. We meet her as she spontaneously moves in with Tim Bisley after bumping into him in a cafe and thinking he's a drug dealer. He's also in a similar, I-have-no-idea-what-I'm-doing-with-my-life situation, and they pretend to be a couple to fit (what they think are) the specifications for the flat they move in to.
Unlike other female TV characters, Daisy isn't flawed in a cutesy, quirky, Zooey Deschanel-esque way; she's not just a way to stir up drama amongst a social group that all sleep with the same guys. She's flawed in the way that many of us are, through a lack of self-esteem and motivation. She says the wrong things and stumbles over the points she's trying to make. She doesn't always wear make-up or look perfectly groomed, and she deals with getting rejected.
Daisy's problems are down to her choosing not to face them. And yet there's a bravery to her
She's trying to be a writer, but most of the time procrastinates in whatever way she can, be that throwing a spontaneous housewarming party or buying a dog. Her best friend, Twist (Katy Carmichael), is a superficial, celery-eating blonde who works in “fashion” (a launderette) and usually spends her time with Daisy either speaking about herself or patronising Daisy: “Daisy! Don't you look nice? A bit of a midriff show. Big's in this season. Good for you.”
While there's a certain part of you that warms to Twist, you still can't help but feel uncomfortable when her and Daisy are chatting, as they have absolutely nothing in common. The thing, though, is that Daisy is her own worst enemy. Her problems are down to her choosing not to face them, and yet at the same time there's a bravery to her – she's not afraid to speak her mind and tell evil bosses (or any boss, for that matter) to fuck off.
Daisy stands out amongst other female TV characters through being so, well, normal. The state of limbo that she's in, drifting about in distraction, is something many of us can relate to, and yet also interesting is that she's in no way a stereotypical female. Throughout the show her and Tim are equals. They both enjoy games and films and going for a night down the pub. Perhaps the most fascinating part about Daisy's character, and Spaced as a whole, is that it shows a platonic friendship between a man and a woman, with only subtle hints to something stronger developing between them.
Everything from her huge specs and exploration of bogling, to anecdotes about a girl named Mulan and toastie maker metaphors for relationships make Daisy Steiner hilarious and adorable, whilst at the same time a representation of women who is dimensional and unusual for TV. As Daisy says at her interview for Flaps magazine: “Girl Power!” – *peace sign*.

On Wednesday, amid continued protests demanding “Justice for Michael Brown” prosecutors will bring evidence before a grand jury as they determine whether to indict Brown's killer, Officer Darren Wilson. The power to indict rests with local prosecutors and pliant grand juries, and as Jonathan Cohn has pointed out, a prosecutor will usually refrain from indicting altogether if the accused faces a low likelihood of conviction. In this case, a combination of entrenched racial and occupational biases, and most importantly the details of Missouri law, all but ensures that a conviction is off the table.
We may never know what actually happened during the violent encounter between teenager Michael Brown and policeman Darren Wilson. But legal judgments rarely happen with perfect knowledge and absolute certainty. In their place, we rely on presumptions and standards that guide our thinking and discipline our judgments. In general, we presume innocence. But when we know that a killing has occurred and can definitively identify who committed the act, traditional common law demanded that our presumptions shift. We are supposed to presume guilt, and it is the shooter who must prove that his actions were justified. Unless the shooter is a policeman. And unless the victim is a black male. And unless the shooting happens in a state with self-defense laws like Missouri.
In any clash of witness testimony, police officers begin at huge advantage. Although the courts insist that juries give policemen no extra credence because of their badges as an “essential demand of fairness,” that's not how jurors actually think or behave. Large percentages of potential jurors readily admit to giving police testimony extra weight, and many more likely act on this implicit bias. And in this case, the favoring of police testimony is compounded by another more pernicious bias: racial prejudice. Extensive research shows that Americans are far more likely to believe that African Americans—and especially young black men—have committed crimes and display violent behavior. It therefore won't take very much to convince a jury that Officer Wilson was acting out of self-defense.
But these cultural biases are only part of the story of why a conviction will be near-impossible. The central reason is a recent trend in many states' criminal laws. Throughout history, claims of self-defense and compelling police activity have served as justifications for the use of deadly force. Most people intuitively understand that self-preservation is a basic right and that police must sometimes use violence to protect society and apprehend criminals. But generally, we expect situations of justified violence and legal killing to be the rare exception, and most people would probably imagine that policemen and citizens raising claims of justifiable homicide must meet a substantive burden of proof. But today, in states like Missouri, these justifications barely require any evidence at all.
Seattle Girl Geek Dinner Review
“Seattle Girl Geek Dinners is the Seattle/Eastside group inspired by the original Girl Geek Dinners. We host dinners to give local women in technology the chance to meet, chat, and just have fun!”

Cristina, our fabulous Twitter Administrator had the chance to check out the 10th Seattle Girl Geek Dinner. She was kind enough to provide the following review:
Seattle Girl Geek Dinner #10 at Facebook Seattle was fantastic.
When I first arrived, I was greeted by the warm welcoming Facebook Seattle staff. After getting my name tag, I proceeded to find a good seat, and saved one for a friend in the second row. The food and drink accommodations were served buffet-style and was quite popular amongst all the geek gals. I enjoyed a refreshing beer while it was announced they would begin the Q&A with four Facebook women engineers at 8pm.
During the Q&A, we learned about the rigorous interview process that consisted of about 6 interviews in total. If you're hired by Facebook, you then go through a 6-week boot camp. There you learn about the best practices of Facebook and receive an overview of what people are working on. The highlight of this boot camp at the very end is that you get to choose which team you want to work with. What's also great about working for Facebook that you can make your own hours. You also have parental leave for 4 months if you have/adopt a child.
Overall, I had a wonderful experience at the Seattle Girl Geek Dinner #10 and really enjoyed getting to know more about Facebook Seattle and the 4 women engineers on the panel.
Everyone was really friendly and approachable.

After the President-elect's disappointing and rambunctious press conference, government ethics experts and the broader compliance community rejected, as woefully inadequate, Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say he should get less than 10 years in prison MORE's legal strategy to mitigate his conflicts of interest.
Walter Shaub, director of the nonpartisan U.S. Office of Government Ethics, explained that the plan “doesn't meet the standards that … every president in the past four decades has met.” Conversely, Shaub praised Trump's Secretary of State nominee, Rex Tillerson, for his “clean break,” noting that, by “forfeiting bonus payments worth millions … he's now free of financial conflicts of interest.”
That's exactly what Trump's proposal failed to do. Yes, turning over business operations to his sons will reduce his distractions. But Trump's ownership and interest in his business remain. Shaub nails it when he said, “Stepping back from running his business is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective.” Shaub also dispelled Trump's attorney's position that “the conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president … [he is] not required to separate [himself] from [his] financial assets.”
Shaub correctly concedes that, indeed, one particular conflicts of interest law, does not apply to the president. But, as Shaub eloquently stated, “Common sense dictates that a president can, of course, have very real conflicts of interest … anything that creates an incentive to put your own interests before the interests of the people you serve … A president is no more immune to the influence of two masters than any subordinate official. In fact, our common experience of human affairs suggests that the potential for corruption only grows with the increase of power.”
The core problem is that Trump won't make the sacrifices necessary to serve as a conflict-free chief executive. Public servants, whose enormous sacrifices enrich the nation, have little sympathy when Trump's counsel complains that “selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets[.]”
Too bad. Shaub reminds us that the president will “be asking his own appointees to make sacrifices… [and] asking our men and women in uniform to risk their lives in conflicts around the world. So, no, I don't think divestiture is too high a price to pay to be the president…”
But the Trump International Hotel on D.C.'s Pennsylvania Avenue best demonstrates that Trump puts his business and financial interests first, and “draining the swamp” a distant second. As far as we know, the hotel lease for the historic Post Office Pavilion is Trump's only business arrangement directly with the U.S. government. As of Jan. 20, Trump will be both the property's landlord and tenant. Trump will be the landlord, because the General Services Administration (GSA) is a federal executive agency. And, of course, the lease states that the “tenant” is “Donald J. Trump.”
The arrangement illuminates why delegating management responsibilities to Trump's sons won't solve the problem. In fact, Trump's failure to divest creates conflicts of interest for other government officials. The hotel lease requires extensive annual disclosure of detailed financial information, followed by negotiations over rent escalation and other payments to the government. Trump's refusal to disclose his tax returns or detail the extent of his business debts raises questions regarding compliance with these requirements.
Yet the lease requires career GSA civil servants—who report to the GSA administrator, who will serve at Trump's pleasure—to decide whether to ask the president's sons for more detailed revenue and expense information, demand an audit, or call for a rent increase. Trump's intransigence will force civil servants to choose between two masters—serving the public by rigorously enforcing the lease's terms or enriching the president by yielding to the president's sons.
The Trump D.C. hotel lease is unique in that it explicitly bars elected officials from participating in it or reaping its benefits. The lease states, “No ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom...” That's consistent with the government's longstanding prohibition on entering into contracts with federal employees.
You don't need to parse the Constitution's emoluments clause to understand that Trump's tax counsel grossly oversimplified the problem in comparing “paying your hotel bill” to a routine “value for value exchange.”
No, the problem is that foreign governments—alongside lobbyists and the other special-interest groups—will enthusiastically pay premium prices to host events, eat meals and stay at Trump's hotel, because the president's actions and words make clear that he appreciates and craves their patronage. That's exactly what the drafters of the Constitution and the well-established conflict of interest prohibitions sought to avoid.
What's so frustrating is that the D.C. hotel lease could (and should) have been transferred or cancelled long before the rapidly approaching inauguration. Any number of hoteliers could take over the property. Marriott, headquartered in the Washington metropolitan area, already operates two dozen hotels in D.C., including two Ritz Carltons and the iconic Mayflower Hotel. Or Trump could simply walk away from the lease, at which point GSA would breathe a sigh of relief.

But Trump did nothing to resolve this blatant conflict. GSA told lawmakers that “GSA received no communications from Mr. Trump … after he won the Republican primary, when it became clear that a breach of the lease agreement was at least a possibility.” Nor did GSA hear from Trump “after he won the election in November, when it became clear that a potential breach ... was imminent. In fact, ... [as of Dec. 14,] GSA has received no communications … from Mr. Trump's business organization about this issue.”
More recently, GSA's press release last Wednesday makes clear that it was not involved in, or familiar with, the details of Trump's conflict mitigation plan prior to the press conference. That's extraordinary.
Ultimately, Trump misunderstands and underestimates the problems inherent in maintaining his business enterprise. Yes, voters knew of his business interests when they voted, and many may not care if he maintains the status quo. The problem is that, going forward, almost every payment to the Trump family business is suspect and raises questions whether it was intended to curry favor with the president. That's quite a cloud under which to govern.
Ethics experts and compliance officials—in the government and the private sector—understand that employees “look up and around” for cues and models of acceptable behavior. If the president discounts the importance of avoiding conflicts, disrespects transparency, and disparages the importance of compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements, the government's credibility is at risk. That's an unnecessary and steep price to pay.

Dallas Police Chief David Brown and about 100 of his officers boarded DART trains Friday morning to show riders that cops are just like them.
Brown chatted with two women about the hit TV show Empire. He took a selfie with a teenager who attends South Oak Cliff High School, Brown's alma mater.
“How are your grades?” Brown asked the student, Carl Smith, 16.
“Pretty good,” Smith replied.
The goal: to forge and maintain a positive relationship with the community, both to improve crime-fighting efforts and help prevent tensions such as the unrest last year that followed a police officer's shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Mo.

The event, called “DARTing With the Chief on the Beat,” was the latest of Brown's “Chief on the Beat” community engagement efforts. It started before 7 a.m. with officers — some dressed as superheroes — riding from six different light rail stations. One officer, Charles Vaughn, serenaded passengers with R&B songs that he sang through a handheld speaker.
Dallas Area Rapid Transit Police Chief James Spiller joined Brown riding from Ledbetter station to the West End.
The chiefs and the officers met at the West End station, where the cops posed for photos with people and handed out free coffee and doughnuts.
“It's true,” one officer said. “We love doughnuts.”
In addition to the swarm of cameras following his every move, there was another quick reminder that Brown really isn't like everyone else. As if to prove he was just another passenger, a DART fare enforcement officer approached at one point and asked to see everyone's tickets — including Brown's.
“You see, what had happened was ...” Brown joked. “My dog ate it,” he later added. “I have to put it on layaway.”
For Brown, the moment of levity belied the serious purpose he sees in such events.
He said it's important to build relationships during times when there is no crisis. That way, if an issue arises — like an officer-involved shooting — the community already trusts the police.
“People don't like to feel like they don't have a voice or that the police department isn't listening,” Brown said. “We don't ever want our community to feel like that.”
Brown said meeting with community members and building trust should not be considered optional for police departments. It's crucial to the job, he said, to show people that the police care about them and are willing to listen to their concerns and questions.
“This is what 21st-century policing needs to look like,” Brown said.
Many passengers seemed pleased to see the uniformed riders and said they appreciated the department's efforts.
“It's good that the police are interested in what the citizens think and they're interested in our communities and what we experience on a daily basis,” said Oak Cliff resident Betty Doyle.
Smith, the high school student from Highland Hills in Oak Cliff, said he enjoyed talking to Brown.
“I grew up in this area so I see crime every day,” he said. “I think it could be overcome.”
Tyron Wesley, 49, who rides the train every day to his job as a recruiter, shook Brown's hand. Then he offered a guarantee.
“There won't be no crime this morning,” Wesley said, looking around. “I feel very safe.”

TEL AVIV – President Donald Trump has convinced Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to make certain concessions that will allow the peace process to move forward, World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder told Israeli lawmakers at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference in New York.
Lauder, considered one of the closest Jewish leaders to Trump, has the president's ear, according to the Jerusalem Post. The Lauder and Trump families have been friends for decades. Lauder, who has extensive ties in the Arab world, has advised the president on how to advance diplomatic initiatives in the Middle East, the report said.
Lauder, who served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's unofficial envoy to Syria, told Israeli ministers at the conference that he was confident Trump would succeed in his attempt to jumpstart the moribund peace process.
The politicians briefed by Lauder included Minister of Education Naftali Bennett, Minister of Justice Ayelet Shaked and Minister of Science and Technology Ofir Akunis, as well as opposition leader Isaac Herzog.
“Trump is very optimistic that he can renew the peace process,” one of the politicians told the Post after speaking to Lauder. “Lauder understands from Trump that he believes Abbas can be convinced by him and Arab leaders to come back to the table and make concessions.”
Three of the ministers, Bennett, Shaked and Akunis, emphatically expressed their opposition to a Palestinian state in their speeches at the conference, saying that Abbas has not proved himself a viable partner for peace.
Herzog, on the other hand, had harsh words for Netanyahu but praised Trump.
“So far, Trump's peace efforts have been impeccable,” Herzog said. “We know what Trump wants. What Netanyahu wants, no one knows. I have grave doubts about Bibi's intentions. If he wants peace, he will enjoy political support even from my camp. But if he opts for what Bibi usually wants, he will find us a fierce opposition and we will replace him as soon as possible.”
Trump is scheduled to arrive in Israel on the morning of Monday, May 22 for a two-day visit. He will be arriving from Saudi Arabia. Some reports have said he will also visit Bethlehem in the West Bank to tour the Church of the Nativity and meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for the second time this month. The first meeting was in Washington on May 3.
ANALYSIS/OPINION:
Next week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to begin floor debate on a defense authorization bill that would repeal the Clinton-era “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy and allow homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces. Last month, a top military official offered a glimpse of how the military might look should the new policy take effect: Those serving who oppose the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) agenda are no longer welcome.
Those were the views of Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Bostick, the Army's deputy chief of staff in charge of personnel matters who spoke about “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” before several hundred troops at the European Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. “Unfortunately, we have a minority of service members who are still racists and bigoted and you will never be able to get rid of all of them,” Lt. Gen. Bostick said. “But these people opposing this new policy will need to get with the program, and if they can't, they need to get out. No matter how much training and education of those in opposition, you're always going to have those that oppose this on moral and religious grounds just like you still have racists today.”
The strong words take additional significance from Lt. Gen. Bostick's direct involvement with a Pentagon panel charged with shaping military policy on this issue. Although Lt. Gen. Bostick presented the question of homosexuals in the military as if it were about civil rights, it is nothing of the kind. The services must discriminate to function. Those who are too old, too weak or too overweight must be shown the door even when similar actions in the private sector might spark a lawsuit. The reason for the military's existence is to win battles and wars, not to ensure feelings aren't hurt or to serve as a playground for social experimentation.
The military's long-standing ban on homosexual conduct is rooted in the principles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which also criminalizes adulterous conduct among heterosexuals insofar as it undermines the good order and discipline of the armed forces. Lt. Gen. Bostick suggested he would employ the same strict disciplinary standards to provide “education and training” that would ensure soldiers, sailors and airmen embrace the new LGBT agenda.
“Unfortunately, if the law is repealed, the military will attempt to do what it does - makes things work, for better or worse,” Tommy Sears, executive director of the Center for Military Readiness, told The Washington Times. “So there will be no toleration of dissent. If for whatever reason you disagree, whether it's religious conviction or personal objection, your career will in essence be over.”
Servicemen should not be booted from the military because of their sincerely held religious convictions. It's unseemly for a senior officer to equate those who hold traditional values with racists and bigots. Lt. Gen. Bostick's careless words demonstrate his unsuitability to the task, and, for that reason, he should withdraw from further involvement in the Pentagon panel set to issue a report on the new policy by Dec. 1. The Senate also should reject this attempt to undermine the effectiveness, morale and morals of the military on the behalf of a radical fringe.

The DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) will be the first update to the diagnostic manual since the DSM-IV-TR in 2000. Changes to the DSM have broad implications including the categorization of disorders for research purposes, the way disorders are conceptualized and what disorders will qualify for insurance reimbursement.
We've compiled a list of the biggest changes in the DSM-5. This list is not exhaustive—it covers the changes that are perceived as being the most influential, or simply the most interesting.
Autism Spectrum Disorder
The DSM-5 has done away with the old distinction of Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder, in favor of the single autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. There is consensus that these disorders represent a single condition at varying levels of severity.
Specific Learning Disorder
Reading disorder, mathematics disorder, disorder of written expression, and learning disorder not otherwise specified have been combined under the single diagnosis of specific learning disorder.
Schizophrenia Subtypes
Due to low reliability and poor validity, the subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, and undifferentiated) have been eliminated. These subtypes were poor predictors of treatment response and longitudinal course of schizophrenia. A new approach will be used to rate the severity of schizophrenia's core symptoms.
Bipolar Disorder
The specifier of "mixed episode" no longer requires the full criteria for both a manic and depressive episode to occur simultaneously. The new specifier, "with mixed features", can be applied to depressive or manic episodes when features of the other are present.
Major Depressive Disorder
The core criteria of major depressive disorder are unchanged. However, the specifier "with mixed features" can be affixed to a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to indicate symptoms of mania without meeting the full criteria for a manic or hypomanic episode.
Phobias
The DSM-IV requirement that individuals over age 18 recognize their anxiety as excessive or unreasonable has been removed. Additionally, the DSM-5 requires that fears must exist for at least 6 months before being categorized as phobic.
Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders
Obsessive compulsive disorder has been removed from the anxiety disorders and moved under the new heading, Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders. Disorders in this category include body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling), excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and more.
Somatic Symptoms Disorder
Somatization disorder from the DSM-IV has been renamed to Somatic Symptom Disorder. DSM-5 criteria emphasize maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, in addition to somatic symptoms. This deviates from the previous emphasis on medically unexplained symptoms.
Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
The DSM-5 introduces a new chapter—Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders—which includes disorders characterized by difficulty with emotional and behavioral self-control. Some of these include oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and intermittent explosive disorder.
Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders
The DSM-5 has expanded the addictions chapter to include non-substance-related addictions. Addictions will no longer be categorized as abuse or dependence, but instead by the rankings mild disorder, moderate disorder, or severe disorder. Rankings are determined by the number of criteria that have been met.
Gambling Disorder
Because gambling has been found to activate the brain's reward system in ways similar to drugs of abuse, and the symptoms are similar to those of substance use disorders, it will now be recognized in the addictions chapter of the DSM-5.
Personality Disorders
Personality traits and functioning can now be assessed in clients who do not meet criteria for a personality disorder. The DSM-5 emphasizes the functionality of personality traits rather than the diagnosis of personality disorders. Additionally, the threshold of diagnosis for specific personality disorders has been changed to reduce misdiagnosis.
Other Changes in the DSM-5
The Galapagos archipelago, a breathtakingly beautiful cluster of 19 islands and more than 100 rocks and islets off the coast of mainland Ecuador, was designated a United Nations World Heritage site in 1978. It is home to thousands of animal species that live in, or depend on, the sea. One of the most beloved is the blue-footed booby, known for its brilliant colors and penchant for elaborate dance. Now it appears that the Galapagos may lose its most iconic species. In April 2014, a team of researchers from Wake Forest University announced that blue-footed boobies had nearly stopped breeding, putting the survival of the species in grave danger.
Researchers from University of California reported similar findings about another shorebird 2,000 miles from Galapagos. While conducting a survey of Mexico's Natural Protected Areas, they discovered that the endangered California brown pelican was largely absent from its primary nesting grounds. Like the boobies, they had nearly stopped breeding. Meanwhile, marine scientists from NOAA had been studying the unprecedented illness of thousands of sea lions on California coastlines.

Are marine animals experiencing a streak of mysterious bad luck? Perhaps. But perhaps it's not as mysterious as it may seem. Blue-footed boobies, California brown pelicans, sea lions, and a number of other species have something in common: Their natural diet is comprised largely of Pacific sardines, which have suffered the worst population crash since the mid-1900s, leading scientists to posit that the sardine crash may be having widespread impacts on local and migratory species dependent on the Pacific Ocean.
Where did all the sardines go?
In 1948, this question was posed to ocean biologist Ed Rickett, who was investigating the most famous sardine crash in history, which began in 1946. He responded, “They're in cans!” Today's scientists don't think the answer is so simple, as sardine populations are known for following a boom-and-bust cycle. However, they don't deny that rampant fishing played a significant role in the mid-century crash, and have found that cool water temperatures triggered a natural decline in the 1940s, which was greatly exacerbated by overfishing. It would take four decades for the population to recover from that crash.
By the late 1980s, sardines had enjoyed a spectacular comeback. For two decades, populations remained stable, with normal cycles of decline and increase. Sardine biomass (a measurement of total adult sardine stock, used by the Pacific Fishery Management Council in calculating catch limits) peaked in 2006-2007. It then began dropping gradually, about 8 to 14 percent every year — until 2011. A mild La Niña weather system developed in late 2010 through early 2011, and returned from late 2011 into 2012, lowering ocean temperatures and creating ocean conditions reminiscent of those the 1940s. In a single year, sardine biomass decreased by 30 percent, from 680,004 metric tons at the beginning of 2011 to 473,374 metric tons at the beginning of 2012.
Before the effects of La Niña event fully developed, scientists had already been warning of trouble. A study conducted in 2011 concluded, “Imminent collapse is likely.” Researchers pointed to unsustainable fishing practices, including high catch limits and a worrisome focus on catching older, breeding-age fish. Yet the sardine fishing quota in the Pacific continued to increase. In 2011, the fishery catch was 10.59 percent of the total biomass. In 2012, that number grew significantly, with a total catch of 18.4 percent of the total biomass. Between 2012 and 2013, the sardine population once again dropped about 30 percent, to a mere 333,268 metric tons by the beginning of 2013. This drop is considered the second great sardine crash, and has been compared to the first notorious crash of the late 1940s and 1950s.
In late 2013, federal fishery managers took heed of the downward trend, setting 2014 catch levels 33 percent below what they would have been under the previous management plan. The most recent formal Stock Assessment Review, conducted in March 2014, projected a slight increase in sardines between 2014 and 2015. However, scientists remain worried, and the 2014 projections have yet to be proven. According to a November 2014 Oceana press release, the Pacific sardine biomass is at the lowest level in two decades, with no clear signs of recovery. Yet the Pacific Fishery Management Council voted to increase the harvest rate by 33 percent, a move that Oceana's Pacific project manager and senior scientist Ben Enticknap called, “a blow to long-term sustainable fishery management.”
When there is a crash, fallout is inevitable
No species or ecosystem exists independently. The collapse of a single population can have direct and indirect impacts on other species for generations to come. This is certainly true of sardines, which are forage fish and represent a significant food source for dozens of species, including, whales, sharks, rays, seabirds, salmon, tuna, and many more. They serve a vital function in the ecosystem, transferring energy from plankton to higher-level predators.

What happens when the sardines disappear? Surprisingly, in 2014 many coastal areas saw an influx of marine life such as whales, due to an anchovy boom. However, alternative food sources may not be as readily available in coming years, leaving the same species that thrived in 2014 with a serious food shortage. Some populations of predators are already feeling the effects of the sardine crash, including the California brown pelican and sea lions mentioned above. NOAA determined that the sardine crash was likely responsible for 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups in California in 2013 Mothers were found to be feeding on less nutritious but more abundant prey and producing inadequate milk. Research has also indicated the crash has been hard on animal populations, and may have contributed to a lack of mating among certain seabirds.
The boom-and-bust cycle of forage fish can span decades, with crashes often worsened and lengthened by fishing practices. Therefore, species dependent on sardines likely face many seasons of scarce food availability in the future. Most will likely survive, but recovery will be a slow, difficult process. Every year of failed breeding leaves a smaller and older population to begin the next mating season.
For the blue-footed booby of the Galapagos, recovery may not come. An in-depth study published in Avian Conservation and Ecology suggests that the Galapagos population of these birds is especially susceptible to sardine availability, because it lacks nutritionally equivalent alternatives. Three decades ago, the colorful birds were abundant, thriving on a diet almost entirely composed of sardines. But the southern Pacific waters, which lie a bit south of the Pacific population managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, have also experienced a sharp decline in sardines, which seems to correspond with the rapidly dwindling population of blue-footed boobies.
It is important to note that researchers did not draw definitive conclusions from the Galapagos study. Like most areas of environmental science, unknowns remain. Researchers could not completely rule out the possibility of disease or weather conditions as causes in altered breeding behavior.

Into the unknown
Is the pacific sardine sill in peril? Are regional and international agencies doing enough to stabilize populations? How big of an impact does fishing have on boom-and-bust cycles of forage fish? There is a general consensus that water temperature patterns drive the cycle, and fishing can exacerbate low points. However, the significance of industrial fishing and the best practices for sustainability remain subjects of great disagreement.
It is impossible to know what the future will bring for global sardine populations or the species that depend on them. Despite heavy criticism of the Pacific Fishery Management Council policies, many consider the Pacific sardine well managed in comparison to other sardine populations. Sardines off the coasts of Chile, Peru, and Japan have been exploited much more heavily, according to NOAA. Even fisheries that have earned Marine Stewardship Council approval for sustainability are suspect, as activists have raised concerns about the organization's credibility in recent years. Furthermore, fishery management only applies to legal fishing operations — the impact of illegal fishing cannot be measured as precisely.
Though we often hear that the oceans are dying, increased awareness, outspoken support, and action from grassroots activists to politicians, just might be lifesaving.

With Jon Stewart about to leave The Daily Show, President Obama returned to the show for a final interview on the program. Stewart raised the issue of a lack of "shared sacrifice" in the country, and suggested that college become three years, followed by a year of national service. President Obama didn't endorse the program as policy, but praised the concept. "The best education I got," President Obama said, was working "in low-income neighborhoods." He said he learned that "I wanted to commit myself to something bigger than just me."
Obama went on to say that young people are more idealistic than people think. "This notion that young people have lost their idealism, or that they are too cynical or ironic, that's not true," he said. "But we have to give them pathways." Obama said that this is why "we've tried to expand AmeriCorps."

Class-action civil rights suit accuses local officials of unconstitutionally jailing people to raise state funds in a system that unfairly affects poor people of color
A class-action civil rights lawsuit filed late Tuesday alleges that more than a dozen St Louis-area municipalities are engaged in the discriminatory and unconstitutional practice of jailing people for unpaid debts in order to raise state revenue, a situation the suit says amounts to a system of modern-day “debtors' prisons” that primarily affects poor residents of color.
The suit alleges a widespread system of local government abuse that targets primarily black communities, where poor people are routinely imprisoned because they cannot escape from the burden of fees generally associated with petty offenses.
“Defendants have created or revived de facto debtors' prisons, using them as a tool to cow poor people into financing municipal government,” the suit states. “Such flagrant abuse is not consistent with the values this country holds dear, with the rule of law, or with the constitutional guarantee of due process.”
The suit was launched on the second anniversary of the police killing of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, whose 2014 death sparked major protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and beyond, and reignited a national debate about the bias against minorities prevalent in the US justice system.
That case led to increased scrutiny of St Louis County, a jurisdiction made up of a maze of 90 constituent municipalities – including Ferguson – 81 of which are responsible for their own police and court systems.
In the wake of Brown's death, the justice department in 2014 launched a federal investigation into Ferguson's criminal justice system, culminating in a damning assessment in March 2015, which decried an overly punitive approach to policing that largely affects residents of color.
The report also singled out the legal system for its reliance on generating revenue from mostly poor citizens as one of the key impediments to serious reform. “Ferguson's law enforcement practices are shaped by the city's focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs,” the justice department report stated.
Tuesday's suit describes how this revenue-focused policing model has continued apace in St Louis County's neighboring municipalities.
All of the plaintiffs in the case were jailed for failure to provide a cash payment related to a fee or fine, the suit says.
In 2015, the municipalities listed in the suit issued an average of 1.7 arrest warrants per household, and one arrest warrant for every adult, mostly for “minor municipal ordinance violations, like traffic tickets”.
The suit points to a “direct correlation between the revenue that a particular municipality raises through fines and fees and the population of black and impoverished residents living in that municipality”.
The justice department has decried the practice of using unpaid fees as a means of imprisoning indigent defendants, and not only in its Ferguson report.
In March, it sent a letter to court administrators and police officials in all 50 states, warning local court systems and police departments against the unlawful use of fees and fines and trapping poor defendants in an escalating cycle from which they may not escape.
Without directly threatening federal action, the letter also noted that local court systems that receive federal money risked violating the Civil Right Acts of 1964 if “they unnecessarily impose disparate harm on the basis of race or national origin”.
“The consequences of the criminalization of poverty are not only harmful – they are far-reaching,” said attorney general Loretta Lynch at the time. “They not only affect an individual's ability to support their family, but also contribute to an erosion of our faith in government.”
The suit follows a similar one launched last year against the municipalities of Ferguson and Jennings by ArchCity Defenders and two other civil rights groups.
Last month, the small city of Jennings, Missouri, ended up settling that lawsuit, agreeing to pay some $4.7m to approximately 2,000 residents, the majority of them poor and black.
“In terms of a class-wide settlement agreement, this is the largest on a case like this,” said Michael-John Voss, cofounder of ArchCity Defenders, the St Louis not-for-profit group representing the plaintiffs.
Voss said his organization was hoping to build on that result.
“I think it sets a precedent for other towns in this region that they're on notice,” Voss said.
The new legal action was brought by ArchCity Defenders and Arnold & Porter, a national law firm, on behalf of 12 plaintiffs against 13 municipalities adjacent to Ferguson, Missouri, in St Louis County.
A separate lawsuit filed on Tuesday, which was also initiated by ArchCity Defenders along with the St Louis-based Dowd & Dowd law firm, challenges how law enforcement handled charges against protesters.
That legal action, also filed in federal court in Missouri, is asking for $20m in compensation and an acknowledgment that the city of Ferguson engaged in the malicious prosecution of four individuals who they say peacefully protested at a vigil just two days after Michael Brown's 2014 death.
The city subsequently spent thousands of dollars prosecuting the cases, according to the suit, even after the justice department's 2015 report.
In March of this year, a month after a justice department lawsuit against the city to force its hand on criminal justice reforms, Ferguson agreed to settle with the federal government under a reform agreement called a “Consent Decree”.
But the second suit released on Tuesday asserts that that agreement came with a carve-out that it would not affect some cases that had already been under consideration.
In its March 2015 report, the justice department described how the “failure to comply” ordnance of Ferguson – which allowed the city to arrest many protesters after the shooting death of Brown during protests even if they were peaceful – was often applied in an unconstitutional and racially discriminatory manner.
But the lawsuit argues that while the Consent Decree required Ferguson to address the “use of arrest in retaliation for exercise of protected speech, it did not require Ferguson to dismiss existing charges against those, like Plaintiffs, who had been arrested on frivolous and retaliatory ‘failure to comply' charges”.
Jasmine Woods, the lead plaintiff in that lawsuit, was acquitted of all charges in April 2016 along with her three co-plaintiffs.
“I felt like someone should be held accountable,” Woods said of the lawsuit.

“I really felt like I had a strong voice then,” she added, referring to the night two years ago when she was arrested for attending the vigil in Ferguson. “I feel like they've kind of damaged that voice because I don't feel like I have the freedom to go out like I did that day.”
Since her arrest, Woods described how difficult it has been to get jobs, and the adverse toll the day has had on her family, her livelihood, and even her passion for criminal justice, the topic of her undergraduate degree at nearby Harris Stowe State University.
She said it felt like the authorities “put a bad aura on my name”.
“We see this as a larger problem in the United States and there is just now becoming some discussion about when are we going to hold the key players in this system that abuse people accountable,” said Voss of Woods' case. “And I think that our lawsuit is a step in that argument.”
Designed to compete with Intel's Bay Trail, the Kabini desktop parts have been created to reflect what AMD claims is the changing face of every-day computing: an increase in the number of applications, like office suites and web browsers, that can make use of GPU acceleration to improve performance. That's something that an APU can do well, of course, but Kabini is more than just a slightly faster version of what has gone before.The new AM1 platform, as Kabini will be known at retail, represents the company's first-ever socket-based system-on-chip (SoC) design, which AMD has dubbed 'System in a Socket.' The Kabini SoC design will be provided as a PGA-based, user-replaceable processor which fits into the new FS1b socket type. Unlike Intel's lower-wattage Bay Trail, which is BGA and soldered to the motherboard at the factory, AM1 owners will have the option of after-market upgrades.The Kabini chips that form AM1 all have a similar feature set: an SoC design featuring up to four Jaguar CPU cores and Graphics Core Next (GCN)-based Radeon graphics with DirectX 11.2 and OpenGL 4.3 support - no word yet on Microsoft's as-yet unreleased DirectX 12 - and support for two USB 3.0 ports, eight USB 2.0 ports and two SATA 6Gb/s ports, all without the need for an external chipset. Manufacturers who need more are, of course, welcome to add extra chips as required.The bottom of the Kabini desktop brand will be the AMD Sempron 2650: two 1.45GHz Jaguar cores, 128 Radeon cores running at 4000MHz, 1MB of cache and support for 1,333MHz memory. Moving up the ladder is the Sempron 3850: four 1.3GHz Jaguar cores, the same 128 Radeon cores but running at 450MHz, 2MB cache and support for 1,600MHz memory.The higher-end Athlon range starts with the Athlon 5150: four 1.6GHz Jaguar cores, 128 Radeon cores running at 600MHz, 2MB cache and the same 1,600MHz memory support. The range tops out with the Athlon 5350, with four 2.05GHz Jaguar cores and the same cache, graphics and memory support. All four Kabini chips will, interestingly, come in at identical 25W thermal design profiles (TDPs) - higher, unfortunately, than Intel's BGA-only Bay Trail designs.AMD looks to be pushing Kabini on the desktop against Bay Trail on three fronts: wider software support for older 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems; higher overall compute performance; and price. The latter is perhaps the most surprising: the bottom-end Sempron 2650 will cost just $31 per unit in trays of a thousand, with the Sempron 3850 stretching to $36; the Athlon 5150 will cost $45 per unit in the same volume, with the top-end Athlon 5350 fetching $55. FS1b motherboards will cost around $25-$35, the company has confirmed, a price point reached by the Kabini SoC taking over tasks that would have previously required an external chipset.AMD has named ASrock, Asus, Biostar, Gigabyte, MSI and ECS Elitegroup as hardware partners on Kabini, each of whom plans to launch low-cost FS1b motherboards in micro-ATX and the compact mini-ITX formats. Formal retail pricing has not been provided as yet.According to AMD's own internal testing, the new Jaguar cores - the same architecture found in the Xbox One and PS4 games consoles - offer considerable advantages over their predecessors. As well as boosts to low-power operation, the company is claiming a 17 per cent boost in instructions per cycle (IPC) over the E1-1500 Bobcat equivalent. Under PCMark 7, the company claims, that translates to a jump for the Sempron 2650 from the E1-1500's 1125 points to over 1300.Higher up the rankings, the Athlon 5350 doubles the Cinebench R15 single-core benchmark compared to the AMD E-350, while its extra CPU cores mean a quadrupling in the multi-core tests. How these will compare to the same benchmark on Intel's latest low-power chips remains to be seen.A particularly interesting aspect of AMD's Kabini design comes from its dynamic power management. During GPU-heavy activity, the less-loaded CPU cores act as a heatsink to draw heat away from the GPU; when the CPU is heavily loaded, the GPU is used in a similar manner. When both are loaded, of course, there'll likely be some down-clocking - but it's a system which should allow CPU- or GPU-bound applications to run at a higher speed than would otherwise be possible.The first UK retailers have gone live with AM1 parts, offering the Athlon 5350 for £39.99, the Athlon 5150 for £37.99, the Sempron 3850 for £29.99 and the Sempron 2650 for £25.99. Motherboards range in price from £26 up to £38.
“It took 4400 million years for the first life to appear on Earth,” is the opening line to the website for HOUND, a recently announced game project by its 18-year-old solo creator, Nikita Shesterin. And if, on reading that, you just thought, “hang on… that's not right,” then Shesterin believes you're the right audience for his game.
HOUND hands you a universe replete with evolving creatures and ecosystem, and then gives you the controls to fiddle. You can create a physical model, perhaps of something as simple as bacteria, and then watch it evolve into a variety of new species—billions of years of evolution in a matter of minutes. An easy comparison would be with Millennium Interactive's artificial life videogame series, Creatures, though Liam Esler, who managed Creatures' community and was involved in its modding scene, thinks this is a false comparison. “As much as Creatures is about the science, the series was much more about empathy and relationships—creating a bond between player and artificial life, exploring the idea of what it means to be ‘alive',” he says.
create things that no one has seen before
HOUND‘s is an eerie, minimalist world filled with Karl Sims-esque creatures scampering and flapping beautifully through the environment before something with a mouth inevitably swoops in to extract their resources. This is a world for players who like to explore the boundaries of systems, and to create things that no one has seen before. Speaking of Karl Sims, who used evolutionary algorithms to generate walking and swimming movements for arbitrary shapes, his work was “an initial inspiration” for Shesterin: “[his work showed] that what I was starting had successful analogs and was technically possible.”
Simulating a universe might sound an ambitious project, especially given that this is his first videogame, but Shesterin describes it as inevitable; “all of it started small, with a simple self-learning robot that was supposed to analyze the environment and develop new systems of walking,” he says. “At that point I knew almost nothing about artificial intelligence and had only basic programming knowledge, but I had lots of ideas. From that moment I started to add new things, to test those ideas and learn in turn.”
Those ideas extend even beyond the game. HOUND is a small chunk of a larger project, the goals of which Shesterin remains coy about. “[Not wanting to be] too vague, it is intended to develop a neural network of high organization which will be able to efficiently improve itself,” he sort-of explains. “For now, I am focused on building a foundation for future research.”
A free PC demo of HOUND is available now. It is purely a sandbox demonstration of the game's systems, though Shesterin talks of adding game mechanics for the final release aimed for September. “If it sticks, and becomes popular, I well expand it to a full campaign mode,” he says. If everything does go to plan for Shesterin, who finished high school early and is hoping to generate money from the game's sales to fund college, an Indiegogo campaign for HOUND will be launched in mid-May.

It was bound to happen: A homeowner has filed suit against online realty giant Zillow, claiming the company's controversial “Zestimate” tool repeatedly undervalued her house, creating a “tremendous road block” to its sale.
The suit, which may be the first of its kind, was filed in Cook County Circuit Court by a Glenview, Ill., real estate lawyer, Barbara Andersen. The suit alleges that despite Zillow's denial that Zestimates constitute “appraisals,” the fact that they offer market-value estimates and “are promoted as a tool for potential buyers to use in assessing [the] market value of a given property,” shows that they meet the definition of an appraisal under state law. Not only should Zillow be licensed to perform appraisals before offering such estimates, the suit argues, but it also should obtain “the consent of the homeowner” before posting them online for everyone to see.
[How accurate is Zillow's Zestimate? Not very, says one Washington-area agent]
In an interview, Andersen told me she is considering bringing the issue to the Illinois attorney general because it affects all property owners in the state. She has also been approached about turning the matter into a class action, which could touch millions of owners across the country.
In the suit, Andersen said that she has been trying to sell her townhouse, which overlooks a golf course and is in a prime location, for $626,000 — roughly what she paid for it in 2009. Houses directly across the street but with greater square footage sell for $100,000 more, according to her court filing. But Zillow's automated valuation system has apparently used sales of newly constructed houses from a different and less costly part of town as comparables in valuing her townhouse, she says. The most recent Zestimate is for $562,000. Andersen is seeking an injunction against Zillow and wants the company to either remove her Zestimate or amend it. For the time being, she is not seeking monetary damages, she told me.
[How accurate is the Zestimate? Zillow says the tool is helpful when used the right way]
Emily Heffter, a spokeswoman for Zillow, dismissed Andersen's litigation as “without merit.” A publicly traded real estate marketing company based in Seattle, Zillow has been offering Zestimates since 2006. At present, it provides them for upwards of 110 million houses, whether for sale or not. Type in almost any house's street address, and you'll probably get a property description and a Zestimate. The value estimates are based on public records and other data using “a proprietary formula,” according to Zillow.
The Zestimate feature is the cornerstone of Zillow's business model because it pulls in millions of house shoppers, allowing the company to sell advertising space to realty agents. Zillow makes big money with the help of its Zestimates: In the first quarter of this year, it reported $245.8 million in revenue — a 32 percent jump over the year before — including $175 million in payments from “premier” agents, who pay for advertising.
[Zillow offerse estimates of your house's value. But the error rate can be high.]
But there's a flip side to Zestimates. Homeowners, realty agents and appraisers have been critical for years about the valuation tool, citing estimates that too often are far off the mark — sometimes 20 percent or 30 percent too low or too high — and misleading to consumers. Zillow itself acknowledges errors. Nationwide, according to Heffter, it has a median error rate of 5 percent. Zestimates are within 5 percent of the sale price 53.9 percent of the time, within 10 percent 75.6 percent of the time and within 20 percent 89.7 percent of the time, Zillow claims.
A Zestimate “is not an appraisal,” the company says on its website, but instead is “Zillow's estimated market value” using its proprietary formula. Another way of looking at the Zestimate error rate: Roughly one quarter of the time, the value estimate is off by 10 percent or more of the selling price, and wrong by 20 percent or more 10 percent of the time. The 5 percent median error rate may sound modest, but when computed against median sales prices, the errors can translate into tens of thousands of dollars — hundreds of thousands in high-cost areas. Also, in some counties, error rates zoom beyond the 5 percent median: 33.9 percent, for example, in Ogle County, Ill., and 10 percent to 20 percent in a handful of counties in Ohio, Maryland, Florida, Oklahoma and Illinois.
Some appraisers are cheering Andersen's suit and welcomed the idea of state-by-state legal challenges. “They've been playing appraiser without being licensed for years, and doing a bad job,” said Pat Turner, a Richmond appraiser. “It's about time they got called on it.”

Hundreds of internal documents from groups run by prominent billionaire liberal donor George Soros were leaked online Saturday after hackers infiltrated the groups.
The 2,576 files were released by DCLeaks, a website which claims to be “launched by the American hacktivists who respect and appreciate freedom of speech, human rights and government of the people.”
The documents are from multiple departments of Soros' organizations. Soros' the Open Society Foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. Files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, “the President's Office”, and something named SOUK.
There are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016. In June, the Open Society Foundations also had several documents leaked by DCLeaks. Bloomberg reported that the foundation notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the hacking.
Documents in the leak range from research papers such as “SOMALIS IN EUROPEAN CITIES PORTFOLIO REVIEW” to specific financials of grants.
DCLeaks previously released emails from Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, the supreme commander of NATO forces in Europe. The emails showed Breedlove upset with Obama's reluctance to address Russian aggression.
DCLeaks has been alleged to be a Russian-backed source.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The miracle behind Pope John Paul II's sainthood: Emily Thomas reports
The Vatican says Pope John Paul II is to become a saint.
Pope Francis cleared the way for his canonisation, expected later this year, after a second miracle was attributed to the late pontiff's intervention.
The Polish-born pope led the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005.
Pope Francis also approved the sainthood of Pope John XXIII (1958-1963), though no second miracle has been attributed to his intervention.
A precise date for the canonisations will be set by a meeting of cardinals, the Vatican said.
Image caption John Paul II is credited as helping to end Communist rule in Europe
The announcement came on the same day that Pope Francis issued his first letter to the faithful, or encyclical. Pope Francis acknowledged that the first draft of the document was written by his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.
The two popes appeared together at a Vatican ceremony on Friday, for the unveiling of a statue.
'Inexplicable recovery'
John Paul II has been on a fast-track to sainthood since his death. Just six years later he was beatified by Benedict.
Canonisation, the final step in declaring a deceased person a saint, requires a further miracle to be attributed to prayers to the candidate after they have been beatified.
Analysis Miracles are not quite as important as they used to be in saint-making. Pope John Paul ll reduced the number required when he made the whole process faster and simpler. And more mundane factors can sometimes help a candidate for sainthood. To an extent, their devotees lobby on their behalf. It's a kind of campaign, and the more well organised, well-connected and widely supported it is, the more effective it might be. The feeling among veteran Vatican watchers is that - along with miracles - a bit of clerical politics working in harmony with the mood of the Church can help open sainthood's door.
An "inexplicable recovery" on the very day of John Paul II's beatification has been assessed as a miracle by the Vatican's saint-making department, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, and Pope Francis has now approved that decision.
A Costa Rican woman reportedly recovered from a serious brain illness, and the Congregation concluded that the only explanation for her recovery was the fact that her family had prayed for the late pope's intercession.
John Paul's first miracle was the apparent curing of a 49-year-old French nun, Sister Marie Simon-Pierre Normand. She had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease, the same malady which afflicted the pope himself in his later years.
Sister Marie claims that she and her fellow nuns prayed for the intercession of John Paul after his death. Her sudden cure had no logical medical explanation and she later resumed her work as a maternity nurse, the Vatican says.
Scandal
Although widely regarded as one of the great popes of modern times, John Paul's 26-year pontificate was tarnished by his handling of the clerical sex abuse scandal that has rocked the global Church.
Critics say some of the Church's other deep-seated problems - such as its dysfunctional management and financial scandals at the Vatican bank - stem from shortcomings of his reign.
Image caption John Paul II suffered from the effects of Parkinson's Disease towards the end of his life
John Paul II streamlined the path to sainthood, and himself created more saints than all previous popes combined.
The process by which the Catholic Church declares someone a saint can only happen after their death, and involves taking evidence about the individual's holiness, scrutinising their deeds and writings, and gathering testimony that others are drawn to holiness and prayer by the individual's example.
The canonisation ceremonies for the two late popes will take place by the end of the year, a Vatican spokesman says, and are likely to attract large crowds to Rome. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in St Peter's Square to mark John Paul's beatification.
Many believers are likely to travel from John Paul's homeland, Poland, where he still enjoys widespread respect as a moral authority and for his role as an inspiration in overcoming Communist rule.
The head of the Polish episcopate, Archbishop Jozef Michalik, said those who observed John Paul II's life already regarded him as a saint.
'The Good Pope'
Pope John XXIII reigned from 1958 until 1963 and was known as "Good Pope John" because of his kindly demeanour.
He was beatified by John Paul II in 2000, and Pope Francis took the unusual step of waiving the requirement of a second miracle in his case.
Image caption Pope John XXIII died of cancer after just four and a half years as pontiff
Pope John, born Angelo Roncalli, convened the Second Vatican Council but died before it was completed.
Vatican II, as it became known, led to significant changes in Church doctrine and opened the way for Mass to be conducted in worshippers' own languages, rather than solely in Latin.
Pope Francis described John XXIII as a "model of holiness" when he marked the 50th anniversary of his death with a visit to his grave last month, according to the Catholic Herald.
Parallels have been drawn between the two popes, and Francis has praised his predecessor's "interior freedom," "exterior joy" and "the effectiveness of his pastoral and diplomatic action".
BERLIN (Reuters) - Countries that share the euro currency must grant debt-strapped Greece and Ireland easier terms on loans they have provided, European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn told a German newspaper.

In comments to be published in Monday's edition of Handelsblatt business daily, Rehn recognized appeals from both countries that conditions on financial bailout loans be eased.
“There is a danger we could overburden both countries with overly strict credit conditions ... (The euro zone must) lower interest on loans for Greece and Ireland,” he said.
The time frame of loans to Greece should also be doubled to seven years from three-and-a-half years, he added.
Ireland's attempts to ease its interest rate burden have clouded efforts by European states to forge a common position on how to address the debt crisis and boost competitiveness.
On Friday, Ireland's new prime minister in waiting pleaded with fellow European conservative leaders for easier terms on Dublin's loans, but was told there would be “no free lunches.”
Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece warned of a bond market backlash if European leaders failed to act decisively.
Turning to the euro zone's rescue fund in general, Rehn appealed to Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, to soften its opposition to expanding the fund's powers to combat Europe's debt crisis.
“I urge the Bundestag not to lose sight of the continuing difficulties in financial markets... several euro zone states are still in danger,” he said.
The Bundestag has forwarded a motion to be voted on in mid-March that seeks to rule out bond buybacks by the euro zone's permanent rescue fund after 2013.
It also takes a hardline stance against most potential solutions to the debt crisis that could make it harder for Chancellor Angela Merkel to compromise with her euro zone partners in upcoming talks on the matter.
Germany, the EU's strongest economy, has made no commitment so far to raising the lending capacity of the European Financial Stability Facility or letting it help countries more flexibly.
EU diplomats say Berlin is waiting to see what commitments other countries are prepared to give at a March 11 euro zone summit before showing its hand on the rescue fund and whether to boost it to allow its full 440 billion euros ($614.6 billion) to be lent out.
A migrant who was jailed after raping a young boy at a swimming pool has had his sentence overturned – as the court couldn't prove he knew the child said no.
The incident occurred when the vile attacker, identified as 20-year-old Amir A, visited Theresienbad pool in Vienna, Austria, as part of an integration process last December.
The Iraqi, who reportedly worked as a taxi driver after entering Austria via the Balkans, had also been provided with a 15-year-old helper and translator.
He brutally sexually assaulted the 10-year-old boy in the pool's changing room – before returning for a swim, later claiming it was a “sexual emergency” as he hadn't had sex for four months.
After the boy alerted a lifeguard, police arrested the man at the scene and the boy was taken to hospital with severe internal injuries. The victim, whose mother is from Serbia, continues to suffer from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.
The attacker was later found guilty of serious sexual assault and rape of a minor, and received a sentence of six years in jail.
But, shockingly, the Supreme Court has now lifted the verdict – after accepting the defence lawyer's claim that the lower court had not done enough to ascertain whether or not the rapist had realized the schoolboy was saying no.
Supreme Court President Thomas Philipp said that while the verdict was “watertight” with regard to the serious sexual abuse of a juvenile, the written verdict on the second indictment, rape, cannot be sufficiently proved.
The 20-year-old is expected to remain in custody until the second trial takes place, when a new sentence will be imposed.
It is believed the new legal process will take place in 2017.
Despite drawing rave reviews on the field, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott has not impressed everyone with his off-field behavior during his first year in the NFL.
Elliott, who remains under investigation by the NFL for an alleged assault that cropped up in July, drew more headlines this past week when he pulled down the top of a woman during a St. Patrick's Day parade. And as a result, he got ripped into by former Cowboys defensive end Marcus Spears for “being dumb.”
“The guy's just gotta stop being dumb, man. That's really what it boils down to. And I'm not going to speak on it like I know all of the particulars but I saw it and I don't understand it,” Spears said on 103.3 radio in Dallas, via the Dallas Morning News. “I was talking to my wife last night about it. With all of the social media, all of the media coverage that we give because we have to and we have to talk about these things, you would think that these guys would have in their minds and they would understand that I have things that I can't do. And not as a football player but just as a human. At the end of the day, the eye of the world is on Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott because of the success that they had. They not only have the eye of the world but they play for the Dallas Cowboys, who are always in the eye of public.”
The NFL's investigation of Elliott is a strange one, because no charges have been pressed by authorities on the alleged incident. Elliott and his camp have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and Elliott's said he wants “closure” when it comes to the NFL's investigation.
But there's no closure coming, because Roger Goodell said at the Super Bowl there's “no timetable” to wrap up the investigation, and there is still a possibility that Elliott ends up facing some punishment. Jerry Jones believes the league hasn't found anything in terms of the investigation, but there's no real way to know how the wind blows on this one.
Having Elliott out in public behaving in a way that does not reflect well on his treatment of women is a sub-optimal way for him to behave while under investigation.
Which is why Spears believes Elliott needs to “lay low” when it comes to his behavior.
“So I think Zeke just needs to lay low. Have fun, man, have fun. He's young. But do it in the right way and the respectable manner,” Spears said. “At the end of the day no one can fault you for trying to enjoy the hard work and the labor that you put in to put yourself in this position. But you also have a responsibility to not only yourself but your family to take care of business the right way and not get involved in stupidity.”
This is absolutely correct. Whatever happened in the past with Elliott will be handled through the investigation and he can't change it right now. But he can make sure that he doesn't further endanger his playing career and earning ability by making a mistake in public. He should also continue to show that treating women with respect is the proper way to behave.
Brisbane's City Council met Monday night to debate whether or not future development of the city's plum 684-acre Baylands site, located south of San Francisco, should include new housing.
Despite all of the anticipation leading up to Monday's meeting, Brisbane lawmakers ultimately reached no decision and deferred the vote until later this month.
Earlier Monday, outside groups called yet again for the city to seize the opportunity to build.
State Sen. Scott Wiener and state assemblymembers Phil Ting and David Chiu (all from San Francisco) were among those who signed onto a public statement addressed to the City Council Monday, reading in part:
Cities both large and small can no longer ignore their role in our regional need for more housing. If we had been more proactive in building housing ten years ago, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today, and if we don't start building today, it's going to be even worse ten years from now. [...] Approving a plan with thousands of homes accessible to public transit would show the kind of local leadership we need if we are going to pull ourselves out of this housing crisis.
Ironically, the council cited housing bills pending in the state legislature by the likes of Wiener and Chiu as the reason to ultimately put off a decision, saying they didn't know enough yet about how future state law might affect development.
Despite pleas from out-of-towners, Brisbane's housing skeptics remain unmoved. Resident Karen Cunningham, speaking during public comment Monday night, said “Brisbane did not create the housing crisis. We should not be the solution to the entire housing crisis.”
Cunningham said that if San Francisco is worried about housing it should do more to fill vacant apartments in the city.
“San Francisco needs to solve their problems before pointing the finger at us,” she added.
(In reality SF's vacancy rate is one of the lowest in the country, although Cunningham is technically correct that this still amounts to thousands of unused homes.)
She even cited Monday's news about the sale of Presidio Terrace as evidence of SF's housing incompetence. “Hello? Hello? Did you guys read that? Now they want to point fingers at us?”
Neighbor Carolyn Parker argued that Brisbane's small-town vibe was too unique in the Bay Area to risk changing.
“We work very hard to keep Brisbane Brisbane,” said Parker. “We like to have a little town here.”
Parker also suggested that the Baylands, a former garbage dump, wasn't safe enough for housing.
“There are other places to put low-cost housing, let's not put it in the Baylands,” Parker said, suggesting that the city build new housing downtown and turn the Baylands into a transit district.
Corey Smith, a community organizer with the housing development-friendly non-profit SF Housing Action Coalition, acknowledged “the small-town feel [of Brisbane] is cool,” but argued that the city can have the best of both worlds by building housing that is “closer to San Francisco” than to Brisbane's current center.
Smith, wearing a green “Build Housing” sticker, pointed out that most of the proposed 4,400 units would be closer to Caltrain's Bayshore Station than to downtown Brisbane.
In the end the city decided to defer voting, a decision the council announced even before public comment.
A woman with a “Build Housing” sticker (unidentified, since she spoke up spontaneously) accused them of kicking the can down the road.
Update: SFHAC's Corey Smith tells us this was Laura Clark from the group YIMBY Action.
“It seems like you're just extending the public process to delay and delay,” she said. “This seems like another effort to not make a decision.”
“Thank you for your opinion,” Councilmember Clifford Lentz replied.
The father of a Jordanian pilot captured by the self-proclaimed Islamic State group in Syria has appealed to the militants to treat his son well.
26-year-old 1st Lieutenant Mu'ath al-Kasasbeh was taken prisoner after his warplane came down on December 24.
Speaking as a delegation of senior Christian leaders visited the family to express their solidarity, Safi al-Kasasbeh said:
“I call on the brothers from ISIL to consider him their son and their colleague in prayer to treat him well and consider him as their son and a guest on this, the anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Mohammad.”
The pilot's plane crashed in a rural area of Raqqa province, an ISIL stronghold in northeastern Syria, while carrying out airstrikes against militant targets.
Jordan, one of several Arab countries involved in the US-led coalition, has not confirmed ISIL's claims that the jet was shot down.
The extremist group released what it said was an interview with the pilot in which he said a missile had shot down his jet. The interview has not been verified.
Some reports say US forces carried out a failed mission to rescue the pilot on New Year's Day.
The young man is said by a family friend to be a devout Muslim who felt it was his religious duty to fight extremist groups like the so-called Islamic State who were “distorting the true spirit of Islam”.

Part 1: Automating repetitive tasks for digital artists with Python
Part 2: Python file-management tricks for digital artists
If you're working with images on a computer, you're bound to eventually run into corrupted files that ruin your day. I run into this with animation renders (remember, the best practice here is to render to a sequence of image files and not a single video file). However, animation and visual effects are not the only places where you see image corruption. You can just as easily run into this in other fields. Perhaps you're a photographer and you've shot a bunch of brackets HDRI (High Dynamic Range Imaging) tone mapping and something glitches when transferring files from your camera.
The problem isn't so much the amount of effort to repair or replace a corrupted image, which is usually just a matter of re-rendering the image or re-copying the good image to your computer, rather the trick is to find those bad images as early in the process as possible. The longer you don't know, the greater the hassle you'll face when you do encounter a corrupt image.
So, what do you do? Well, you could go through and open each file—one at a time—in your image editor or viewer of choice, and let that program tell you there's a problem. However, photograph images are large and it can be annoying and time-consuming to go through a whole set just to find one or two baddies. And although animation renders are typically smaller files, you often have a lot more of them to go through. In my case, I regularly produce renders that have over 44,000 frames in a render. (No, that's not a typo—forty-four thousand frames.)
The solution? You guessed it. Write a script.
As with previous articles in this series, you'll do your scripting in Python. Step one: get a listing of your files. Fortunately, if you've gone through the last article in this series, you know that's a matter of using the os module. Assume that all of the image files you want to inspect are in a single directory on your hard drive. Furthermore, assume that you're going to run this script from within that directory. Using Python, you can get a list of those files with the following code:
import os
for filename in os . listdir ( './' ) :
print ( filename )
If you'd like, you can narrow down that list of images (or at least more clearly specify it; for instance, you don't want to include this script as one of those files) by looking just for files that end with the PNG extension:
import os
for filename in os . listdir ( './' ) :
if filename. endswith ( '.png' ) :
print ( filename )
You now have a list of PNG image files in your current working directory. Now what? Well, now you need to figure out which, if any, of those images are corrupt. In the previous articles of this series, we exclusively used modules that ship with Python by default. Unfortunately, discovering if an image is corrupt without any image processing capability is difficult, and neither Python 2 nor Python 3 ship with any way to handle that out of the box. You'll need to get yourself an image processing module to view these files. Happily, the Python development community has made that easier for you.
In fact, you have an entire library of packages available to you to install. You just need to know how to get them. Let me introduce you to pip, the recommended tool for installing Python packages. It's installed by default on most platforms when you install Python.
Note: I'm using Python 3, but if you're using Python 2, nearly everything I've written in this series is transferable between both variations of the language. Also, many Linux distributions prefer that you use their own package management system over using pip to install Python packages. Feel free to stick to that if you prefer. The suggestion to use pip here is mostly in the interest of being consistent across all of the platforms you can use Python on.
The specific package that I'm going to recommend that you install is called Pillow. It's a "friendly fork" of the original PIL (Python Imaging Library) that works in current releases of both Python 3 and Python 2. All you need to install Pillow is to fire up a terminal window and type pip install Pillow. The Python package tool should handle the rest for you from there.
Once you have Pillow installed you need to actually have a way of using it in your script. Because it's installed, you can treat it just like any module that comes with Python. You use import —in this case, you could use import PIL . However, to look for corrupt images, you don't really need to import the entirety of the Pillow library into our script. In Python, you can import just a single subcomponent of a module. This is good practice because it reduces the memory footprint of your script and, just as importantly, it makes it more clear what things your script is going to do right from the start. Plus, when you import subcomponents, you end up needing to type less once you get into the meat of your script. Which is always a nice bonus.
To import a subcomponent of a module, you precede your import with a from directive. In the case of Pillow, your script really only needs to use the Image class. So, your import line would look like from PIL import Image . In fact, you can do the same thing with the os module. If you look back at the previous code, you might notice that you're only using the listdir function in the os module. So instead of import os , you could use from os import listdir . This means that when you get into your script, you no longer have to type os.listdir . Instead, you only need to type listdir , because that's all you've imported.
Pulling all that together, your script should now look something like this:
from os import listdir
from PIL import Image
for filename in listdir ( './' ) :
if filename. endswith ( '.png' ) :
print ( filename )
You've got the Image class in Pillow loaded, but your script still isn't doing anything with it yet. It's now time to get to the functional section of your script. What you're going to do is the scripted equivalent of opening each image file and checking to see if it's readable. If there's an error, then you've found a bad file. To do that, you're going to use a try/except block. In short, your script is going to try to run a function that opens a file. If that function returns an error, otherwise known as an exception, then you know that image has a problem. In particular, if the exception is of types IOError or SyntaxError, then you know you've got yourself a bad image.
The syntax for doing a try/except is pretty straightforward. I've described it in code comments below:
try : # These next functions may produce an exception
# <some function>
except ( IOError , SyntaxError ) as e: # These are the exceptions we're looking for
# <do something... like print an intelligent error message>
In the case of looking for corrupt image files, you'll want to test two functions: Image.open() and verify() . If you wrap those in a try/except block, your corrupt image-finding script should look like this:
from os import listdir
from PIL import Image
for filename in listdir ( './' ) :
if filename. endswith ( '.png' ) :
try :
img = Image. open ( './' +filename ) # open the image file
img. verify ( ) # verify that it is, in fact an image
except ( IOError , SyntaxError ) as e:
print ( 'Bad file:' , filename ) # print out the names of corrupt files
And there you go. Save this script in your directory of images. When you run it from the command line, you should get a list of all the corrupt image files in there. If nothing prints out, then you can assume all of those image files are good, valid images.
Of course, being able to use this script on any arbitrary directory would be nice. And having the script prompt you to instruct it to go ahead and delete those corrupt files for you would be even nicer. Good news! You can make the script do exactly that. We'll cover that in the next articles in this series.
In the meantime, have fun rooting out corruption in your image folders.
Hi Everyone :)
I'm wearing Essence Here's My Number today, this is a Sparkle Sand effect polish a.k.a. a texture polish. This was another polish I put off wearing because I thought I wouldn't like it on but I loved it!
It's a gunmetal grey base with lots of fine silver glitter and holographic glitter. It wasn't as gritty or matte as some texture polishes but the contrast between the rainbow colors and sparkle of the glitter and the dark grey was lovely.
I love grey polishes so this is an automatic favourite for me and the holo glitter put it right at the top of the list. Don't judge this one by the bottle. It's fab on :)
I found it hard to capture the holo glitter in this pic but I added one of the bottle which shows it a little. It's alot nicer in real life. This is two coats and no topcoat.
Thanks for looking :)

Local authority's administration announces intention to pay off the millions owed by city venue.
STV
Aberdeen City Council is set to write off £26.2m in loans owed by Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre to the local authority.
The council's Labour-led administration announced its intention to “pay off the historic loans” at a press conference on Tuesday.
However council leader Barney Crockett was unable to specify where the money would come from to bail out the conference centre or how long it would take to pay off the debt.
He said: “This would be a momentous decision which would allow the AECC to plan more clearly for the future and go forward on a firmer financial footing as a major public exhibition space unencumbered by debt.
“This is the clearest possible evidence of this administration's commitment to the economic future of the city.”
When asked where the £26.2m would be found to settle the debts, Councillor Crockett said: “We have to look at that. The first thing is we have the determination. The people can be assured the money is not coming off planned revenue or capital expenditure. I think we can find a way to reduce the debt level and put the exhibition centre on a firm financial footing.”
He added: “I'm very optimistic about timescale but we are not laying down a timescale at the moment.”
Ed Gillespie, chairman of Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre, said the move would allow them to focus on the future and not be weighed down by the capital debts of the past.
He said: “It is the best possible news for the exhibition centre because it removes a long-standing capital debt, which has been there since the place opened almost 30 years ago and was never resolved.
“If that capital debt is written off as I hope it's going to be then we can get on with planning for the future and making sure that the exhibition centre is at the forefront of all energy and other exhibitions.”
The search for justice caught up with former athlete Oscar Pistorius, whose "shockingly lenient" prison sentence for murder was increased to more than 13 years.
South African's Supreme Court sided with state prosecutors appealing the six-year sentence handed down for the death of Reeva Steenkamp, a model who was shot by Pistorius at his home in Pretoria during the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013.
The Olympian shot four times through the door of a bathroom and said at a 2014 trial followed around the world that he believed his girlfriend was a burglar.
An original five-year sentence for culpable homicide was later upgraded to murder, and prosecutors brought the 30-year-old's case back into court again this year.
Oscar Pistorius taken to hospital due to chest pains
"The sentence of six years' imprisonment is shockingly lenient to the point where it has the effect of trivializing this serious offense," the South African judge said.
The family of Steenkamp, 29 at the time of her death, has voiced support for the efforts to increase the punishment.
"They feel there has been justice for Reeva. She can now rest in peace," the family's lawyer Tania Koen said after the verdict.

She added that "they still live with Reeva's loss every day" but that the grieving loved ones had their faith in the justice system restored by the increase.
Pistorius denies suicide attempt after treament for wrist cuts
Pistorius' brother Carl wrote on Twitter that he was "Shattered. Heartbroken. Gutted."
The 13 years and five months that the convicted killer received on Friday came from a 15-year sentence for murder, with time he has already spent in prison for the crime subtracted.
Steenkamp's murder came less than a year after Pistorius had earned the world spotlight by becoming the first double-leg amputee to compete in the Olympics alongside the Paralympic Games.

Challenge
This project will equip a rural community library with a computer lab, including ten laptops, internet access, instructors, solar electricity and battery charging. Africa SOMA has been working since 2007 to open and equip this library, the first one to exist in the isolated and drought-prone area. This computer lab, in partnership with Smallbean, will provide students and community members with access to technology, educational resources, training, and a much-needed means of communication.
Solution
In southern Kenya, recent droughts have decimated the cattle herds of the Maasai. There is increasing urgency for diversification through education, small business creation and agriculture. However, communities are remote, and lack access to electricity and information. Despite the enthusiasm of students, schools are understaffed and lacking even the most basic resources. However, without computer literacy, it is difficult for graduates and community members to be competitive in the job market.
Long-Term Impact
The Elangata Wuas Resource Centre, opened in August 2010, has already increased access to learning materials and provided programs such as adult literacy classes. Highly in demand, courses offered at this computer lab will teach skills needed to be competitive in the job market. Information on alternative income sources will be available at the click of a mouse, helping reduce the economic devastation of future droughts. Solar electricity will allow a much greater diversity of library programs.

JAMAICA, Queens (PIX11/CNN) - Two police officers and a woman were injured, and a hatchet-wielding man was fatally shot during a bloody altercation Thursday in Queens and now officials are looking to see if the attack was prompted by terrorism.
Four rookie police officers were working near 162nd Street and Jamaica Avenue when a freelance photographer asked them to pose for a photo in front of a Conway store. While they were posing, another man, 32-year-old Zale H. Thompson, attacked without saying a word, Commissioner Bratton said at a press conference Thursday.
"The suspect was described as having charged at the officers," Bratton said.
Swinging an 18 1/2-inch metal hatchet, Thompson first hit a 24-year-old officer Joseph Meeker in the right arm -- he was later taken to Jamaica Hospital in stable condition.
The suspect kept swinging, striking a second officer in the back of the head, critically injuring officer Kenneth Healey, 25.

The other officers fired multiple shots, killed the suspect at the scene.
A 29-year-old woman passing by was struck by gunfire in the lower back. She underwent surgery at Jamaica Hospital and is in stable condition.
Thompson, who was wearing a green, hooded jacket at the time of the attack could be seen hiding behind a bus stop before he charged the officers. It's unclear what motive he had, since he said nothing before the attack.
In the wake of the Ottawa attack the NYPD has been on high alert, but Commmissioner Bratton says there is no evidence yet that Thompson, a convert to Islam, did it for religious reasons. Authorities are still investigating the possibility of a motive inspired by radicalism.
The officer who sustained the wound to the back of the head was stable and alert at the hospital, where friends and family have gathered. He will be undergoing surgery for a "very serious injury to the back side of his head," Commissioner Bratton said.
In just his first year on the job, the injured officer, who has not been identified, comes from a family of NYPD cops.

Commissioner Bratton said he doesn't believe the photographer was working in any way with Thompson. Officers are now reviewing his photos from earlier in the day.
“Three rookie cops absolutely modest about what they did, thankfully all are in good condition,” Mayor De Blasio said.
The attack happened in a bustling, commercial part of Queens. An Applebee's restaurant, a Verizon store, several banks and a church are located nearby.
The miserable weather may have prevented additional injuries, as the sidewalks were emptier than usual thanks to a steady rain.
Want to send a Facebook message to a stranger's inbox? Just pay a dollar. Want to send a Facebook message to Mark Zuckerberg? Pay $100.
That's right. Social network Facebook is now testing a new messaging feature that's going to impose a financial cost on the message sender. According to an announcement made recently by the company, this “may be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and facilitate delivery of messages that are relevant and useful.”
“For example,” the announcement read, “if you want to send a message to someone you heard speak at an event but are not friends with, or if you want to message someone about a job opportunity, you can use this feature to reach their Inbox. For the receiver, this test allows them to hear from people who have an important message to send them.”
Sounds great, but there may be certain people whom it may be impossible – or, to be more precise, expensive – to reach. As a CNBC story noted, it will cost a user $100 to send a Facebook message to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
“Facebook has been ramping up its efforts to create new revenue streams and one way they are doing this is by offering users more paid services, like its paid messaging system, which is still in testing,” wrote CNBC's Cadie Thompson. “(But) it's unclear why the social media giant is now charging some people an increased fee of $100 to direct a message to Zuckerberg's inbox.”
Got some extra pennies in your marketing budget? Let us know if the Facebook Paid Messages feature is something you, as a local business owner, will be checking out. Even if you're already using something like Sponsored Posts to send messages out to existing and potential customers, Facebook Paid Messages may still be a great way to respond privately to consumers who make queries, ask you questions, or post online reviews of your business.
Greetings from the Narrative Design team! This is Paul Kirsch, and I'm here to present the next part of our short story series that showcases the world of Tyranny.
I previously introduced the Scarlet Chorus – one of the armies serving Kyros the Overlord – in my story Under New Management. This time around we have a very different military force in the spotlight: the elite Disfavored. I wanted readers to understand both of these armies from the perspective of soldiers (or conscripts) at the front lines. Though Tyranny has no lack of fascinating personalities at the highest levels of leadership, some of the most interesting stories are found in the rank and file.
I also wanted to offer a sense of what it means to serve within the Overlord's organized hierarchy. Even though Terratus is a world where evil won, that doesn't make it a world devoid of hope or ambition. As long as hope and ambition aligns with the will of an all-powerful tyrant, everyone should get along splendidly. Right?
With that firmly in mind, enjoy Commission!
-Paul Kirsch, Narrative Designer
Commission
Aurora moved to plunge her sword into her opponent's guts. He dodged to the side and bashed her across the face with his shield. She took the blow with a deserving sting and barely managed to catch herself by one hand on the way down to the sawdust-strewn floor of the sparring field. She accepted the fighter's offered hand with gratitude.
“I almost had you,” Aurora said, wiping blood from the side of her mouth.
“Aye, almost,” said Teodor of the Stone Shields. The big man was twice her size and out of breath. Aurora could at least content herself on having exhausted the behemoth.
“Any serious damage?” Aurora asked. She took off her helmet and winced as she touched her cheek.
Teodor appraised her and shrugged. “A nasty bruise, but it's already at the end of its cycle.”
She guessed as much. A familiar warmth spread throughout her body as the Archon of War's covenant healed her wounds. Aurora had taken numerous injuries throughout this span of hard training leading up to the offensive, and would have appeared a horror of cuts and bruises if not for the protection of Graven Ashe to mend her in short order.
Teodor rolled his shoulder with a smile. “You're getting better. Gave me a few dents I won't soon forget. I'd say you're more prepared for the long march than any of us.”
Aurora was about to compliment his form when a loud voice bellowed outside of the training circle:
“Stand at attention!”
Aurora straightened her posture and struck a respectable salute. She knew only one person in the legion who could trumpet over the din of battle: Iron Marshal Erenyos. When she made her presence heard, no one stood at ease.
The Disfavored lieutenant marched into the training arena wearing the armor of her station – the imposing plates and skull-shaped mask of an Iron Guard. She turned to survey the dozen assembled members of Aurora's cohort.
“Close order!” she called.
The soldiers responded with single-minded coordination – arranging themselves in a two-layered phalanx, locking into their assigned spots and raising their shields with practiced ease. This was the default form they were to execute in the event of an ambush. The Iron Marshal was testing their reflexes. Aurora steadied her breathing and held herself in a battle-ready stance.
The Second Cohort lived in anticipation of marching on their enemies in the South. Graven Ashe and his twisted counterpart, the Voices of Nerat, had already dispatched a Scarlet Chorus mob to prepare the way for an organized invasion. Was this to be their hour of glory?
The Iron Marshal walked down the line and nodded, stopping once to knock the wind out of a soldier whose breastplate was improperly secured. At the end of her survey, she spun on her heel and called:
“Stone Shield Aurora!”
It took Aurora a moment to register her name. She gasped and stepped forward. “Present!”
The Iron Marshal advanced on her, taking a scroll from the case looped at her hip. The vellum was bound by a seal of purple wax, but Aurora had seen enough of these pass her by that she didn't need to guess at its contents.
“Congratulations are in order, soldier!” the Iron Marshal barked. “The Archon of War has deemed you worthy to command the Second Cohort. Prepare to march at first light.”
Aurora released her stored breath and allowed a smile to burst onto her face like a sunbeam. Her countrymen who shared the line broke into immediate applause – for her, for the war, for the Archon, it didn't matter. The Iron Marshal held her silence for as long as she could tolerate the display, and then cut it off with a piercing whistle that got everyone scrambling back to attention.
“Commander,” she said to Aurora, “report to the smithy. They'll send you off with iron befitting your new rank.” She held out the scroll and nodded to the assembled Stone Shields. “When we leave Fort Resolution, this sorry lot will answer to you. Remember the North. Remember that we bring the glory of Kyros, not meaningless slaughter. And most importantly, don't let the legion down.”
“Yes, ma'am!” said Aurora. “Hail Kyros and the Great General!”
The Iron Marshal gestured to the highest tower of the citadel keep. “After you're outfitted, report to Evocatus Varimas. He'll formally discharge you from service to the Stone Shields and debrief you on the mission. Dismissed, Commander.”
Aurora accepted the scroll with pride. She nodded and struck a sharp salute. Teodor smiled at her and resumed his training with a new partner. Aurora waved her commission at him and marched from the arena holding her chin up.
Commander, she thought. I could get used to that.
***
Zdenya, Maser of the Forge, squinted at Aurora and motioned for her to turn around.
“Does it feel tight?” she asked.
They stood in the midst of artisans laboring over forges, conjured flames, and molds of white-hot iron. Aurora had donned her new armor – a breastplate that seemed ornate compared to the austere trappings of the Stone Shields.
“Feels good enough to sleep in,” she said.
Zdenya wrinkled her nose. “I won't understand Disfavored traditions if I live to be as old as Tunon. Consider yourself lucky. That might be the last piece we produce for a while.” She glanced to a diminishing pile of iron ore and frowned.
“What makes you say that?” asked Aurora.
The Forge Master sighed. “Fatebinder Calio is breathing down my neck to increase productivity for the war effort, but I don't know what miracle she expects to get out of me. We're low on supplies since the collapse at the Tanavon Mines. Consequently, keep an eye out for a source of iron in the South.”
Aurora nodded as she made the mental connection. Apparently the rumors spreading throughout the legion had not reached the forges. She heard that the miners at Tanavon had cast off their chains and killed their taskmasters. The Archon of Justice dispatched the Fifth and Seventh cohorts – seasoned veterans, all – to revive the operation and curb the growing iron shortage, but no one received word of their success. That was privileged information. Sensitive information. One did not talk idly about the defiance of Kyros' Law.
“We couldn't adjust your iron in any case, what with the accelerated timeframe,” said Zdenya. “Perhaps later, if you find it uncomfortable. The legion will have a contingent of Forge-Bound traveling in tow. I'll join the war effort after you've established a permanent outpost in the Tiers. With any luck, I'll see you there.”
Aurora shook her hand with gratitude. “We won't need luck while the Great General leads the charge.”
Before they could say their farewells, an ear-splitting boom shook the walls of the forge. Aurora and Zdenya whirled about to see one of the smiths immolated head to toe in his own conjured fire. The man was beating at his face and chest, screaming with wild abandon as flames roared under his uniform, consuming him with impossible speed. The others kept their distance and shielded their eyes. Aroused by the noise, soldiers swarmed the area, but held back from intervening.
“Someone put him out!” Aurora sprinted across the workspace, shoving aside the gawking artisans as she grabbed a bucket of water.
A hand snagged Aurora roughly from behind. It was Zdenya, fixated over Aurora's shoulder and wearing a stolid expression.
“Don't,” said Zdenya. “The forge doesn't show mercy for human error. Ours is an exacting, indifferent art, and this fate is no more or less than what any of us can expect.”
Aurora forced herself to look at the burning man. He was curled up on the ground, most of his body already reduced to smoking ashes. Candle flames peeked from the spaces once occupied by eyes.
“So fast,” whispered Aurora. “If someone had reached him in time…”
Zdenya tightened her grip on Aurora's shoulder. “Do you seek a glorious death in battle? This is ours. A talented man gave himself to the forge, and the rest will learn from his example. Don't diminish his sacrifice with regret.”
Aurora lowered her gaze as much out of respect as to quell the dizzying sensation that rolled through her.
“The iron you wear has a price dearer than gold,” said Zdenya. “Remember that when you march to war, Commander.”
***
Aurora made her way across the grounds of Fort Resolution and toward the highest tower in a daze. Soldiers and attendants busied about assisting in the cleanup effort at the forges, but she worked hard to push the tragedy from her mind.
She explained her purpose to the castle guard and mounted the spiral staircase, but only when she reached the entrance to Evocatus Varimas' quarters at the top did she realize she had crushed the scroll bearing her new title in a sweaty fist. She flattened out the creases against the wall and knocked on the wooden door.
“Enter,” someone called.
She pushed through to a spacious, carpeted lounge. Varimas stood at the window. He was bald and thin, wearing a purple robe that covered his skeletal frame. Aurora could see the stitching on the back where the sigil used before Kyros dubbed the legion “Disfavored” had long since been removed. He was facing away from her, looking out on another sparring field of Stone Shields drilling in formation.
“If you've come to escape whatever din they're raising outside,” said Varimas, “you're in the right place.” He turned around and smiled. His entire face was a ragged mess of scar tissue that had long since healed into a smoothed-over approximation of his features.
“Evocatus.” Aurora bowed. This time she had to work to summon up her confidence. Before it had come so easily. “I received a new assignment, and with my compliments I beg that you release me from duty so I can lead the Second Cohort to war.” She held out her scroll.
He unrolled the vellum and read her orders. “Such a hurry to form up against the Southern barbarians and deliver Kyros Peace,” he murmured. “Ashe must be under a great deal of pressure to send our freshest and brightest out into the field.”
“The Great General does nothing without good reason, sir,” said Aurora.
“Your certainty is well placed, but… ah, never mind.” Varimas frowned and made his way to a desk where he signed the commission with a flick of his quill. “Come tomorrow, the fort will empty and I'll be on my own, dispatching birds to the Archon and hoping they remember their way back. I envy you the freedom to die on your feet in battle, as every Northerner should. When I was doused with boiling oil at the hands of agitators, Ashe's protection denied me the cold embrace of the Void. If you receive such a terrible wound, make sure it counts.”
“Evocatus,” Aurora started, “I…”
He waved her off. “Don't let my apprehensions deter you. I have lived too long and optimism is the privilege of the young. But I can still wish you a pleasant conquest.”
His turnabout didn't comfort Aurora in the least, but she nodded all the same.
“Now,” said Varimas as he pored over the document, “the Second Cohort leaves in advance of the legion's thrust. No doubt Ashe believes that a subtler approach can spare a few Northern lives, and I'm inclined to agree. Just remember that…” Varimas cut himself off and furrowed his brow, taking note of a pulsing illumination outside. “What are those fools of the Nineteenth Cohort up to now?”
When he reached the window, he raised a shaking hand up to his mouth and sucked in a gasp.
Aurora joined him, at once convinced that another fire had broken out. The soldiers in the arena below had set their weapons aside to look up, beyond the walls of Fort Resolution and toward a distant sky. Anxious, indistinct murmurs built in volume.
A ray of dark green light descended from the thickening clouds and struck the remote mountains with waves of arcane energy. Aurora tightened her grip on the window as if to steady her balance, though she didn't understand exactly what she was witnessing. Something about it felt terribly wrong, like a perversion of order and sanity.
“The Fifth and Seventh!” someone cried below. “Ashe's mercy… they failed!”
At first Aurora didn't intuit the meaning or implication. Panicked discussion grew in volume, making both apparent to her in waves of mounting dread.
Varimas clutched his brow and let out a moan. “Of course,” he said. “As the crow flies, that way leads straight to the Tanavon Mines. Kyros must have lost patience with the uprising.”
Aurora focused on his words, suddenly the most stalwart and dependable objects in her life. She pictured the jagged hills distorting as the assault opened up massive sinkholes, allowing the land to rush in and fill them anew. Two cohorts of Disfavored soldiers – good Northerners – lost in the arcane equivalent of leveling an anthill.
“An Edict to quell the dissent,” Varimas said. He set his mouth in a tight line and squeezed his eyes shut. “It's an appropriate response, but…” he trailed off, risking nothing of what he may have felt on the matter.
Aurora stood next to him and watched the Overlord's magic unmake the horizon. She imagined the men and women underground, their bodies crushed under pressure. She saw controlled flames licking at every forge with hungry anticipation. Even the soldiers below resembled nothing more than the armored dead. Never had her thoughts rallied so gruesomely against what she once considered her better reason.
“Not even the Great General can protect us from this, can he?” she asked.
Varimas looked at her. Had he eyebrows, they might have raised. “Everything that happens in the name of Kyros' Peace is yours to endure. Graven Ashe cannot heal that wound. It is our duty to stand as the righteous sword of the Empire, our devotion unquestioned… Commander.”
He slid the parchment back to Aurora. She only picked it up after a long hesitation, and its promise no longer filled her with warmth.
THE END

In Bangladesh, a country whose society often still regards marriage far more as a merging of two families than as a union of two people, love can be a complicated, even dangerous thing.
Religious, economic and social factors are the conditions that count –- hard terms for young people who dream about love and freedom of choice.
Many sweethearts meet in secret to escape the disapproving eyes of their parents or even their friends. Parks are a favored location for their encounters.
Arif Mahmud, 26 and Rashna, 21, both students at the University of Liberal Arts, have been together for two years. Their families are aware but do not approve of them dating. The couple hope that given time their families will eventually accept and support their relationship.
Masum, 29, and Sopna, 20, have been married nearly a month. The couple had never met before their wedding, but have no qualms about revealing that their marriage was arranged. Advocates of arranged marriages maintain that the wedding is just the starting point on the path to love; other factors –- religion, status and economic well-being -– should be the real determinants of who marries whom, they say.
Dhaka's Chandrima Uddan Park is one of the most popular meeting spots for clandestine lovers. Just a few years ago it was impossible for couples to meet in public places without the risk of being harassed, but times are changing and now they can hold hands and talk undisturbed.
Lakhi and Firoz knew each other for four years before they married. In keeping with tradition, after the wedding Lakhi will move to live with her husband and his family. Tears to mark the bride's separation from her family are an expected part of the ceremony.

Author of political thrillers had been battling prostate cancer.
Vince Flynn, photographed at his home in Sunfish Lake, Minn., in January 2012, was a prolific writer. (Photo11: Andy King for USA TODAY) Story Highlights Novelist was diagnosed in 2010 with prostate cancer
Fans include former president George W. Bush
His books caught the attention of the Secret Service
Novelist Vince Flynn, who was diagnosed with stage three metastatic prostate cancer in 2010, but continued to write his best-selling thrillers, has died at the age of 47.
Flynn died Wednesday morning at United Hospital in St. Paul.
He's best known for his CIA page-turners that starred Mitch Rapp, a counterterrorism operative who made Flynn the darling of conservatives.
He wrote 14 USA TODAY best sellers. Three reached No. 2 on the list: Kill Shot and The Last Man (both in 2012) and American Assassin in 2010.
His publisher, Atria, says it's not yet known what or how much was completed on Flynn's next novel, The Survivor, originally scheduled to be released in October.
In a 2012 interview with USA TODAY, Flynn discussed living and working with cancer: "The first 48 hours of my diagnosis were hellish," he said. "Things just seemed to get worse and worse. We (he and his wife) were sneaking around the house, whispering so the kids wouldn't hear us. It was horrible.
"But, he said then, " I feel great now. ... We have this under control."
He's survived by his wife, Lysa, and three children (a stepson, 16, and two daughters, 11 and 9).
His fans included George W. Bush, who called Flynn "a little too accurate" because Flynn's books are often so true to CIA actions around the world. Once, while catching a ride in Bush's limo from Andrews Air Force Base, Flynn was grilled by the then-president on where he gets his information.
"I started to stutter," Flynn said.
His 2004 Memorial Day describes a raid very similar to the one that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Often his books have been put on security review by the Pentagon before they are released, and they are even used by the Secret Service to identify possible lapses in their security.
"It used to astound even me," he said of his "clairvoyance." All he did, he said, was "connect the dots. I just look at what's going on in the world."
Flynn was working in sales and commercial real estate 20 years ago when he began reading voraciously in an effort to conquer his childhood dyslexia. In the process he fell in love with espionage novels and decided to try writing one himself.
His first book, Term Limits, was self-published in 1997 after Flynn received 60 rejection letters. After its immediate success, an agent signed him.
Flynn said his novels are "entertainment, educational and serve as cautionary tales."
Heading the charge is rough-and-tumble CIA agent Rapp, who was introduced in Flynn's second novel, Transfer of Power.
Flynn was close friends with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, whom he called "one of the smartest guys I've ever met."
Flynn said not all his fans are conservatives. But if the scales tip toward the right, it probably comes from the pro-military, CIA and law enforcement theme of the books," he said. "And the idea that the United States is not the problem."

Enslaved have never been scared to push the envelope, their sound evolving with each album to encompass more ideas, combine more styles and explore more uncharted musical territory. The timeline of their career has been one of development – from nascent black metallers to today's titans of extreme prog.
“RIITIIR” is without doubt an extreme metal album; and yet… amidst the extreme vocals, slab-like guitars and fast, technical drumming are moments of real beauty, as Enslaved deliver melody, vocal harmonies and acoustic passages. And it's more than just a collection of contrary styles hastily cobbled together to produce an ersatz prog album; here the diverse elements dovetail seamlessly, forming a collage of sounds that herald Enslaved's total mastery of the form.
On the band's Facebook page, guitarist and founding member Ivar Bjornson says:
‘Describing the sound on the new album is both easy and hard… It is easy because it sounds like Enslaved, whatever that means. It is hard because there are so many layers and different focal points. I have a feeling that it has a deeper complexity than our previous efforts, but at the same time, I do find it more catchy and moving.'
He's spot on with the many layers and focal points. There's also a lot of melody: if anything the more extreme sections throw the melody into even sharper relief. Listen to the vocal melody on “Storm Of Memories” and ask yourself if you ever expected to hear that on an extreme metal album. I can't put my finger on why it's quite so compelling, but it's been playing over and over in my head for days now.
Enslaved have always shown themselves to be interested in doing things differently; the first time I heard them was “Heir To The Cosmic Seed” from 2006's “Ruun”, and straight away it was clear that they were not just your average band. Their journey into experimentation and development continues with this new album. They haven't lost their links to extreme metal; rather they're building bridges to other musical spaces. It becomes apparent during the course of the album that melody is increasingly important to them, as well as the ‘feel' of the song; “RIITIIR” is an atmospheric album built on great swells of emotion.
Each song has not one, but numerous things that differentiate it from the others; the sound is undoubtedly Enslaved, but any template has been thrown out of the window, this defenestration allowing them to vary sounds, rhythm and dynamics, from the more traditional extreme metal sounds of “Veilburner” to the rich vocals of “Death In The Eyes Of Dawn” that are almost euphoric in their delivery.
And talking of vocals, the interplay between extreme and clean vocals is more pronounced than ever on “RIITIIR”; often it's almost a call and response, a conversation between two sides of the band's psyche; while at other times the two are combined to moving, disconcerting effect.
Go further into the album and by the time you arrive at the remarkable “Roots Of The Mountain” it's clear that this is a band at the top of its creative game, a group which has matured into a remarkable musical force. They are unafraid to drop in elements of math metal (the intro to “Storm Of Memories”), acoustic and electronica (“Forsaken”) and surprising vocal melodies (particularly in the aforementioned “Death In The Eyes Of Dawn”); there is even some piano in “Forsaken”.
“RIITIIR” (a compound word made up of ‘Rites' and ‘Rituals' which apparently means ‘The Rites of Man') is an immense musical journey, from the cacophonous intro of “Thoughts Like Hammers” to the final, cathartic acoustic section of “Forsaken”, taking in more of the sonic landscape than you can possibly imagine. It is the product of a band that just gets better with every album, who keep pushing themselves to create ever more majestic and detailed work. On their 12th studio album, Enslaved have achieved something on a profound scale; an album of such complexity, detail and scope that it can rightly be described as brilliant.

It sounds big and bold to say “I'm going to step out of the shadow of all those who came before me and make my own name, my own life, my own legacy.” But mice, men, plans and all that jazz.
I've been warming various park benches across Windenburg for the last few weeks at night. The last few coins to my name have been bleeding out of my pockets for croissants and cups of coffee at the coffee shop. I haven't been back to the Lot for a while now, there's been no need. A flat, hard park bench in front of a fishing pond or in a park is better than the cold, lumpy, bug and bad-will infested ground of the Lot.
Most mornings I've been arriving at the coffee shop before they open, having tossed and turned on a nearby bench for a few restless hours. While there I rub together a few coppers to produce enough food to get me through the rest of the day. Luckily the barista soon came to recognize me and, realizing my vagabond ways, has been sneaking me a few extra scraps of day-old pastries that I couldn't afford otherwise.
One morning I was approached by this beautiful woman who introduced herself simply as “The Kat.” I thought at first that my rugged appearance was calling out to fellow crazed wanderers, but she quickly told me that she works as the opening act at the local Entertainment Club.
I told her that I fiddled with a violin when I was a teenager. She took this to, naturally, mean I would be perfect as an opening act stand-up comedian. I assumed that she was joking, since I have no sense of humor and self-deprecation is something I only do when I truly mean it.
But nevertheless, we ended our conversation with her offering me a job. A steady source of income in exchange for a few painfully awkward nights a week would hopefully come together to start my nest egg. Or at least give me enough to buy those day-old pastries.
Pro tip: if you ever find yourself newly homeless come to a place like Windenburg. It not only offers everything you need throughout various public buildings but no one blink an eye at the crazy man who treats the the gym like his own personal bachelor pad.
While a stand-up comedian is used to being laughed at, I decided that I wanted people to laugh at my jokes and not my rumbling stomach or dirty clothes. And if something stunk it should be those jokes and not me.
While there is something to wandering through the deserted park as the sun rises, following the smell of the ocean, and being drawn into a life closer to the natural order of the world, I was nothing but happy when, after my first few days at work, I was able to finally put down some roots.
Even if those roots are superficial and secured only with flimsy metal stakes.
Finally, I feel like I can make an emotional commitment. To the Lot. To Windenburg. To my new home.

A keyboard with Num Lock turned on as indicated by an LED
Num Lock or Numeric Lock (⇭) is a key on the numeric keypad of most computer keyboards. It is a lock key, like Caps Lock and Scroll Lock. Its state (on or off) affects the function of the numeric keypad commonly located to the right of the main keyboard, and is commonly displayed by an LED built into the keyboard.
The Num Lock key exists because earlier 84-key IBM PC keyboards did not have cursor control or arrows separate from the numeric keypad. Most earlier computer keyboards had separate number keys and cursor control keys; however, to reduce cost, IBM chose to combine the two in their early PC keyboards. Num Lock would be used to choose between the two functions. On some laptop computers, the Num Lock key is used to convert part of the main keyboard to act as a (slightly skewed) numeric keypad rather than letters. On some laptop computers, the Num Lock key is absent and replaced by the use of a key combination.[citation needed]
Since most modern desktop computers have a full-size keyboard with both a numeric pad and separate arrow keys, Num Lock is rarely used (always on) for its original purpose, and ends up confusing the user if it has for some reason been turned off without the user being aware of this.[original research?] This can be more of an issue on most laptop computers, since activating the Num Lock function typically requires use of the Fn key and if a user accidentally switches it on they may have no idea how to switch it off. If a full-size keyboard is plugged into a laptop, then the Num Lock function is normally on (as expected) for the external keyboard, and the user would not have to activate the Num Lock function to use the numeric keypad for numeric entry. Since Apple keyboards never had a combination of arrow keys and numeric keypad (but some lacked arrow keys, function keys and a numeric keypad altogether), Apple has keyboards with a separate numeric keypad but no functional Num Lock key. Instead, these keyboards include a Clear key.[citation needed]

Americans are largely ignorant of the historic facts presented in the Internet essay below. It is put forth via Chuck Carlson's ‘We hold these truths.org website':
The greatest enablers of Zionist chutzpah, which threatens the world. are America's oxymoron Zionist Christians, who have no more implacable a challenger than Carlson, who is a real Christian, who has opposed the likes of John Hagee and Pat Robertson valiantly for many decades (pointed out by Gordon Duff months ago. Here: Video: The Roots of Christian Zionism
I have supported Carlson's efforts for many years, (at Radio Free America & Liberty Lobby) and want everyone to read the poignant history he brings up.
As long as I can remember, the audacious liars for Zionism have denied the facts of this history. No history curriculum in America tells it this way (the truth of it). And only over the Internet, especially here at VT, does one get such a counterbalance to Zionists.
There is a new video on Zionist chutzpah, put up just today, as you will see, even when the info comes from the far left, there is censoring—the video was “removed.” Netanyahu to Israeli Jews: Don't Marry Americans.
Now here are ignored facts of history:
November 29, 1947 was the date the UN passed the Partition Resolution partitioning Palestine, more or less equally, into a Jewish and an Arab state.
In fact, the ethnic cleansing commenced the very next morning when the 75,000 Arab citizens of Haifa were subjected to a campaign of terror jointly by the terrorist group, the Irgun, under Manachem Begin, and the Haganah, the regular militia under David Ben Gurion. The Jewish settlers who had arrived during the previous decade had built their homes higher up the mountain and thus occupied a higher topographical space. From the superior height, they could snipe at the villagers at will. They began doing this while the Jewish troops rolled barrels of burning oil down their roads and then ignited them. When the terrified residents came out to try to extinguish the rivers of fire, they were sprayed with machine gun fire. Another techniques were to deliver cars filled with explosives to Arab garages to be repaired, and then to detonate the cars in the garages.
On its website, the official historian of the Palmach (a special unit of the Haganah) states, “The Palestinians [in Haifa] were from December onwards under siege and intimidation.”
This was the beginning of the ethnic cleansing and occurred six months before the first regular soldier from a surrounding Arab state entered Palestine, which was on May 15, 1948.
I remind you that the Deir Yassin massacre occurred on April 9, 1948, and also that by May 15, all of the major cities of Palestine had been cleansed of Arabs and about one half of the 750,000 to 800,000 Palestinian refugees has been ethnically cleansed.
This was the beginning of the expulsion of the Palestinians Arabs from Haifa and from Palestine. The ending for Haifa's Arabs came on Passover evening of April 21, when the British commander, Stockwell, called four Arab community leaders in to this office to inform them that the British army would be evacuating the city and advised the Arabs that they could not be protected. As Ilan Pappe puts it:
“Previous correspondence between them and Stockwell shows that that they trusted him as the keeper of law and order in the city. The British officer now advised them that it would be better for their people to leave the city, where they and most of their families had lived and worked ever since the mid-eighteenth century, when Haifa came to prominence as a modern town. “ – (Pappe, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, p 94)
Pappe continues:
“[I]t was Mordechai Maklef, the operation officer of the Carmel Brigade … who called the shots. Maklef orchestrated the cleansing campaign, and the orders he issued to his troops were plain and simple: ‘Kill any Arab you encounter; torch all inflammable objects and force doors open with explosives.' “When these orders were executed promptly within the 1.5 square kilometers where thousands of Haifa's defenseless Palestinians were still residing , he shock and terror were such that, without packing any of their belongings or even knowing what they were doing, people began leaving en masse. In panic they headed towards the port where they hoped to find a ship or boat to take them away from the city. As soon as they had fled, Jewish troops broke into and looted their houses. … “In the early hours of dawn on 22 April, the people began streaming to the harbor. As the streets in that part of the city were already overcrowded with people seeking escape, the Arab community's self-appointed leadership tried to instill some order in the chaotic scene. Loudspeakers could be heard, urging the people to gather in the old marketplace next to the port, and seek shelter there until an orderly evacuation by sea could be organized. ‘the Jews had occupied Stanton road and are on their way', the loudspeakers blared. “The Carmeli Brigade's war book, chronicling its action in the war, shows little compunction about what followed thereafter. The brigade's officers, aware that people had been advised to gather near the port's gate, ordered their men to station three-inch mortars on the mountain slopes overlooking the market and the port – where the Rothchild Hospital stands today – and to bombard the gathering crowds below. The plan was to make sure the people would have no second thoughts, and to guarantee that the flight would be in one direction only. Once the Palestinians were gathered in the marketplace – and architectural gem dating back to the Ottoman period, covered with white arched canopies, but destroyed beyond recognition after the creation of the State of Israel – they were an easy target for the Jewish marksmen. “Haifa's market was less than one hundred yards from what was then the main gate to the port. When the shelling began, this was the natural destination for the panic-stricken Palestinians. The crowd now broke in the port, pushing aside the policemen who guarded the gate. Scores of people stormed the boats that were moored there, and began to flee the city. We can learn what happened next from the horrifying recollections of some of the survivors, published recently. Here is one of them:
‘Men stepped on their friends and women on their own children. The boats in the port were soon filled with living cargo. The overcrowding in them was horrible. Many turned over and sank with all their passengers.'” (Pappe p 96)
Thus it was the Jews who pushed the Palestinians in to the sea, and not vice versa.
In March of 1948, a month earlier than the events described above, the so-called ‘Plan D' or ‘Plan Dalet', as a further crystallization of Plans A, B and C, was finalized by David Ben Gurion, and those who were continually in consultation with him, and distributed to the Haganah commanders. This document was a blueprint for the destruction Arab villages and expulsion of its residents, within the 78% of Palestine coveted by Ben Gurion, not the 55% apportioned to the Jewish state by the UN General Assembly. By this time 30 Arab villages had been either destroyed or depopulated. By the year's end, 531 Arab villages would be destroyed, and 11 Arab neighborhoods in urban areas.
On revealing paragraph of this document states:
“These operations can be carried out in the following manner: either by destroying villages (by setting fire to them, by blowing them up, and by planting mines in their rubble), and especially those populations centers that are difficult to control permanently; or by mounting combing and control operations according to the following guidelines: encirclement of the villages, conducting a search inside them. In case of resistance, the armed forces must be wiped out and the population expelled outside the borders of the state.”
Between the time that Israel declared itself a state in May of 1948 and the summer of 2005, Israel killed 50,000 Palestinians, according to Israeli Historian Ilan Pappe, writing in Foreign Policy, in the summer of 2005. And since October of 2000, Israel has killed 6430 Palestinians, according to the web site, If American Knew. The latter figure averages to about 2 Palestinians killed per day by Israel (1.932, by my calculation.)
According to the Israeli Committee Against House Demolition, Israel has destroyed 34,000 Palestinian homes in the West Bank, and East Jerusalem since 1967, and, in the same period, about 800,000 olive and citrus trees in the west Bank and Gaza resulting in a loss to the Palestinian economy of $55 million, according to a recent estimate by the international humanitarian relief agency Oxfam. And in Israel's winter assault on Gaza in 2009, Israel destroyed between 4 and 5,000 homes and either damaged destroyed as many as 50,000. Many Gaza families spent the winter of 2010 living in caves dug out of the rubble of their destroyed homes because the area is under siege with building material not allow entering.
Because of the siege of Gaza, babies are frequently born with anemia because their mothers are not getting enough nutrition and because of the lack of food allowed into Gaza and because of the destruction of agricultural areas inside Gaza. The stunting of growth because of the lack of nutrition of Gaza's children is prevalent, and I have seen this figure put at 14%.
Israel, a state which had never clearly defined its boundaries, invites Jews from all over the world to immigrate to Israel and expand it ranks, along with its boundaries into Arab lands.
One thing is certain: Israel is not the victim, as it is constantly screaming, but the victimizer.

Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors writes that the Democratic Party has “milked” the votes of African-Americans

My morning rituals are typical. I wake up yearning for a few extra moments of rest. I express gratitude to a higher power for the breath in my body and the blessings in my life. I shower. I dress. I eat breakfast. I exchange laughter and words with my beloveds, embracing each other as we say our daily goodbyes. As I stand at the threshold of my home, the liminal space between warmth and safety and the chaos of the outside world, my experience becomes explicitly Black. Everyday before I leave my house, I ask myself, will today be the day I am murdered by the police?
#BlackLivesMatter was created in 2013 after Trayvon Martin's murderer, George Zimmerman, was acquitted for his crime, and dead 17-year old Trayvon was posthumously placed on trial for his own murder. Black Lives Matter is both a network and a movement. The network has 26 chapters and affiliate organizations globally. The movement is made up of Black folks and allies who are not necessarily a part of the network. We are decentralized — meaning we focus on local leadership and help build the capacity of those most impacted to fight and win victories for their communities. We understand the local is the national and we must utilize our resources as such. We support both international and local action and policy changes that empower the Black community.

On Aug. 8, 2015, as the Black community prepared to collectively mourn the anniversary of the murder of Mike Brown by Ferguson police, members of Black Lives Matter disrupted a Bernie Sanders rally in Seattle. In the week since that disruption, at least nine Black people have been killed by state-sanctioned violence. Do we know the names of the nine people who faced a trial by fire? Do we know how the loss of their lives has impacted their families and communities? Or are we so collectively focused on the feelings of White presidential candidates that we have missed the essential purpose of the disruption? We as a movement will continue to disrupt the current political process until Black Lives Matter.
Agitating a perceived political ally to the Black community is strategic. For far too long, the Democratic Party has milked the Black vote while creating policies that completely decimate Black communities. Once upon a time, Bill Clinton was widely perceived as an ally and advocate for the needs of Black people. However, it is the Clinton administration's Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act that set the stage for the massive racial injustice we struggle with in law enforcement today.
[Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post's new political tipsheet]
Let us recall: Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill provisions included $10.8 billion in federal matching funds to local governments to hire 100,000 new police officers over a period of six years, $9.7 billion allocated for the construction of new federal prisons, creation of 60 new death penalty offenses, mandatory minimums for crack cocaine possession and the decision to allow children as young as 13 to be tried as adults. The Clinton administration gave birth to the very era of mass incarceration that current Democrats are renouncing with great emotion and fervor. But these are ardent words with no concrete agenda.
Bill Clinton's legacy is not amicable to the needs of our community. On the contrary, the Democratic-led war on drugs and crime was a thinly veiled war on the Black community as a whole. Today, over a million Black people are imprisoned, stark casualties of war.
As a Black millennial, I remember with horrid detail how Democratic policies ravaged my community and destroyed my family. My father was in and out of jail and prison on drug charges my whole life, dying in a homeless shelter not long after his last release in 2009. While in jail awaiting trial, my brother was inhumanely brutalized by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department within inches of his life. My personal history, along with the history of many Black people in this country, is rife with trauma born out of anti-Black policies aided and facilitated by presidents and their administrations.
The anti-Black policies in this country are inspired by the atrocities of American chattel slavery. Too often, we speak about racial disparity and injustice in this country without putting it in its historical context. The relationship between White and Black America began with 245 years of enslavement. Although some Founding Fathers acknowledged slavery as a violation to their essential value of sovereignty, their commitment to preserving private property rights was paramount.
Our relationship to this country as Black folks has been playing the role of currency, property and resource. The three-fifths compromise during the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention was a political debate focused squarely on determining the worth of our humanity for the purposes of taxation and congressional representation. The intrinsic belief that we were property was not up for discussion, rather [what was was up for discussion was] how much we as property were worth to White men. Our worth has always been in question in this country. No presidential candidate has ever centered their agenda around the worth of Black lives. We are committed to redefining our worth as Black people and holding our country's representatives accountable.
The goal of Black Lives Matter is to transform America's systemic hatred against Black people. Yes, we will fight for policy reform, but we know that every gain in this area can be retracted if we do not change the anti-Black culture in this country. Our role in the current election cycle is accountability. We know by centering conversations on the most disenfranchised among us, we ensure true liberty and justice for all. We will disrupt presidential candidates and all elected officials, we will move towards bold and creative action to deliver the ideals of democracy for ALL people inside of this country.
Black Lives Matter affirms the lives of all Black people. We declare that the lives of Black queer and trans-folks, disabled folks, Black-undocumented folks, folks with records, women and all Black lives along the gender spectrum matter. We are not asking for our humanity or worth to be given back to us. We are not begging for the rights promised to us in the U.S. Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation. We are demanding that the breath in our bodies guarantees our right to life, our right to freedom, our right to love, dignity and respect.

Unions and politicians are calling for Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp to safeguard Welsh jobs when they go ahead with their planned merger.
The Indian and German companies have signed a memorandum of understanding combining their European steel operations in a 50-50 venture.
It will lead to about 4,000 job losses.
Almost 7,000 people are employed by Tata in Wales, including more than 4,000 in Port Talbot - the largest steel works in the UK.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bimlendra Jha, of Tata Steel, and Guido Kerkhoff, of Thyssenkrupp, welcome the deal
The two companies had been in negotiations since last year when Tata withdrew from a sales process to sell its entire UK operations.
It was confirmed on Wednesday that the flat steel businesses of the two companies in Europe and the steel mill services of the Thyssenkrupp group will merge under the deal and will be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel.
But the two partners expect the move will lead to about 4,000 jobs going, half from administration and half from production.
The Community union said it would be seeking assurances for workers.
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary, said: "While a merger of this size will inevitably mean a review of support functions such as HR and IT, the vast majority of these roles are no longer located in the UK.
"We have been assured there will be no asset closures or reductions in production capacities across the UK.
"If the company does seek to implement compulsory redundancies we will fight that using every necessary means."

Welsh Government Economy Secretary Ken Skates said he and First Minister Carwyn Jones had spoken to Bimlendra Jha, chief executive of Tata Steel UK, earlier on Wednesday.
Mr Skates told AMs: "I have been given assurances over the assets that exist across Wales and the UK that there will be no closures, that the announcement paves the way to a sustainable and competitive future for the steel industry in Wales.
"But I will be seeking further discussions not only with Tata but with Thyssenkrupp to ensure that the interests of Welsh workers are at the very heart of the joint venture."
A planned Advanced Steel Innovation Centre at Swansea University would still go ahead, Mr Skates added.
Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock cautiously welcomed news of the deal, saying: "It's very good to see the clear long-term commitment to Port Talbot."
But he added: "Tata Steel committed to investing £1bn, to maintaining the blast furnaces, and to averting compulsory early redundancies.
"Those commitments must be honoured, and I will be seeking assurances from the company that they are in no way affected by today's news."
Analysis: Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent
Tata has always been a complex story with lots of changing elements.
In the short term, this at least provides certainty for workers that Tata's plan for a merger is moving ahead.
Unions want assurances that Tata will invest in Port Talbot including a refit of one of the blast furnaces.
They are not expecting major jobs losses in the UK as part of the deal but say they will fight any compulsory redundancies if they do arise.
Tata had previously committed to investing £1bn in Port Talbot over 10 years depending on market conditions, trying to avoid compulsory redundancies and keeping the two blast furnaces operating for five years.
Those pledges were made to secure support from workers to implement a less generous pension scheme.
The concern remains over the long-term commitment of Thyssenkrupp Tata to Port Talbot and jobs there.
The drop in the value of the pound and the rise in steel prices currently benefits Port Talbot as does the greater efficiency it has introduced in production.
But steel prices are volatile, the world is still producing far more of it than is needed and the value of the pound could rise again.
South Wales West AM, Suzy Davies, said it was vital the Welsh Government "keeps its promise to support staff affected by the changes".
"Care must also be taken to ensure that any restructuring does not undermine the future viability of operations here in Wales," she added.
Councillor Alun Llywelyn, who represents Ystalyfera in Neath Port Talbot, said the deal was a "step forward" but added: "We need a lot more information about their business plan."

Who is Thyssenkrupp?
Krupp's roots are in Germany more than 200 years ago and Thyssen was formed in the 1870s. The two steel companies merged in 1999
The group employs 155,000 people in 80 countries across the world
The European steel division has 27,000 workers, producing 13 million tonnes of crude steel a year
There has been speculation about a merger with Tata Steel since July 2016
Andrew Robb, chairman of Tata Steel Europe, said the announcement marked the latest step in "building a future for Tata Steel's activities in Europe which is sustainable in every sense".
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the companies shared an ambition for Port Talbot "as a world-class steel manufacturer, with a focus on quality, technology and innovation".
Tata's £15bn pension scheme had been a major sticking point in the merger negotiations.
But an agreement with Tata workers and the support of the pensions regulators meant the company had distanced itself to a large extent from its pensions liabilities.
What is invoice financing and why is blockchain the missing link?
Jure Soklic Blocked Unblock Follow Jun 2, 2017
As mentioned in our previous blog, financial institutions now offer invoice financing solutions to help increase the purchaser's working capital and the supplier's liquidity.
Invoices are sold at a discount in order to improve liquidity on either side of the chain. This helps businesses mitigate currency volatility, forge better relationships with their suppliers and, of course, improve their liquidity.
Common supply chain finance strategies include factoring and invoice discounting. Receivables are sold to a bank at a discount as soon as they are approved by the buyer. The bank then commits to pay the company's invoices to the suppliers. Finance providers charge borrowers interest rates based on the time value of money, as well as the risk or uncertainty of future cash flows.
hive-project.net
Sounds great! So, what's the problem?
Well, even though this is of course a step in the right direction, things are still far from perfect. The process still takes too long. It's cumbersome, unwieldy, costly and error strewn. To make things worse, usually only large invoices from well established companies are taken as collateral due to the massive amounts of work involved in checking each invoice and the scope for duplication and human error. The calculation of contras, debtor concentrations and dilution levels, all of which can have a significant effect on the amount of credit available, takes time, effort and incurs higher costs.
This unfortunately leaves most SMEs out in the cold.
Imagine how the economy would surge ahead if all this potential liquidity became available to the SMEs that need it. The mind boggles at the impact this would have. But is this possible?
Yes, it certainly is. And that's precisely where HIVE comes in. Although factoring as a concept is sound, there is a crucial technological component that is missing. That component is blockchain technology and smart contracts.
More about invoice financing and HIVE in the next blog post.

Library Journal: Early Scares: Halfway to Halloween | The Reader's Shelf
In they critically acclaimed A Natural History of Hell: Stories Jeffrey Ford gathers 13 previously published stories into one collection that mixes fantasy and horror and shows his talent for distinctive sagas in which evil lurks just under the surface. Each installment relies on a dark and anxious mood with varying levels of speculative influence, outcast characters, and shocking conclusions. It opens with public exorcisms in the compelling and disquieting “The Blameless.” From there it ventures into vignettes as diverse as the “true” ghost story behind an Emily Dickinson poem and the sinister “Blood Drive,” in which every high school senior is required to carry a gun.
Joel Cunningham, B&N, The Best Science Fiction & Fantasy Collections and Anthologies of 2016
“Jeffrey Ford is probably writing your dreams…. If you're looking for something you haven't seen before, look no further than these 13 stories.”
Publishers Weekly: Holiday Gift Guide:
“This is the perfect reader-who-has-everything gift for fantasy fans with a literary bent or vice versa. Ford brilliantly cross-pollinates the grim suburban settings of literary fiction with fantastical elements, adding dashes of humor and empathy to provide some light in dark days.”

Reviews &c.
“Ford specializes in employing vivid and precise language to portray the inexplicable, often with great intensity or deadpan humor. In his odd but compelling stories, strange things happen for reasons that are never made completely clear but that demand attention even as they grow ever more disturbing. A Natural History of Hell is an excellent sampler of Ford's singular brand of storytelling, a baker's dozen of diverse and diverting literary treats.”
— Michael Berry, San Francisco Chronicle
“Formally Ford's stories are object lessons in how to stage a narrative.”
— James Sallis, F&SF
“In this collection of 13 stories, Ford showcases his award-winning talent for crafting creepy tales that bend the world as we know it in unexpected ways. Although the stories are not linked, they do share a common theme: wickedness lurking just beneath the surface of everyday life. And while each uses different degrees of the supernatural to get there, all employ a dark and uneasy atmosphere, quirky characters, and thought-provoking endings, with delightfully unsettling results. . . . This collection is a good choice for fans of short stories by Neil Gaiman, China Miéville, or Kevin Brockmeier.”
— Booklist Online (starred review)
Publishers Weekly Best Books of Summer:
“Celebrated short-form fantasist Ford blends subtle psychological horror with a mix of literary history, folklore, and SF in this collection of 13 short stories, all focused on the struggles, sorrows, and terrors of daily life. Each tale gently twists perceptions, diving down into the ordinary and coming back out with a thoughtful nugget of the extraordinary. Readers will be alarmed by how easily they relate to the well-meaning but inevitably destructive characters.”
“The polished assurance of the prose is breathtaking, while the evocation of character is completely natural. Ford seems able to segue from patrician objectivity to dirty realist down home talk without apparent effort.”
— See the Elephant
“A Natural History of Hell is a chimera: his stories combine surrealist (il)logic with both terrifying and familiar characters and situations. The stories braid together fantasy and history, the near-biography with the almost-mystery, and the result is surprising and enchanting and wonderful.” — Hazel and Wren
“Jeffrey Ford is probably writing your dreams. It's the best way to describe his surreal style, which frequently relies on an internal structure and logic to convey images that teeter between odd fantasy and unsettling horror, while remaining impossibly grounded in a tangible reality. A Natural History of Hell (out in July) goes to some odd places, with genre-bending stories about artists trapped on a rocket ship, imaginary serial murderers, and God being torn apart by an angry mob, but it leaves plenty of room for beauty, however dark. It also contains one of my personal favorite stories from last year, “Word Doll,” in which children are lured into a world of make-believe. If you're looking for something you haven't seen before, look no further than these 13 stories.”
Standout stories: “A Rocket Ship to Hell,” “The Blameless”
— Barnes & Noble: 7 Essential New Sci-Fi & Fantasy Short Story Collections
“Seamlessly blends subtle psychological horror with a mix of literary history, folklore, and SF in this collection of 13 short stories, all focused on the struggles, sorrows, and terrors of daily life.”
— Publishers Weekly (starred review)
“13 tales that revel in the dark and strange, exhibiting ardent and pliable storytelling that ranges from suburban exorcisms to ghosts in bucolic 1915 Ohio. Each story in this collection displays Ford's vigorous invention and witty idiosyncrasy in explorations of the wicked and violent corners of the imagination, but the variety of subject, setting, and tone ensures that the book never slips into an authorial haze. . . . The entire collection has a zeal for imagination and an unabashed pleasure in both entertainment and graceful writing that is reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's short fiction. Ford has a knack for choosing the precise words that evoke an image and leave enough room for it to bloom. “Later, the rain started in again. The sound and smell of spring came through the screen of their bedroom window while he dreamt in the language the angels dream in, and she, of the land without worry.”
— Kirkus Reviews
“What distinguishes this collection of tales by New York fantasy writer Jeffrey Ford is its mix of eerie, sometimes violent subject matter and droll narrative voice; the juxtaposition of modern, ordinary settings and dialogue with the strange and the supernatural makes for memorable reading.”
— Daily Hampshire Gazette
“‘The Blameless' is . . . a perfect example of Ford's eerie subversion of mundane life. In it, suburban parents have begun throwing their children exorcisms as rites of passage, and the premise delivers plenty of black humor and bone-dry social satire.”
— Jason Heller, NPR
“A series of hits that linger long after you've finished reading. The mundane seems fantastical when penned by Ford, and the fantastical dreadfully human. Stories range from surreal daily life, to epic fantasy, to Gothic Americana and far, far beyond. It's hard to pick a favorite, so I recommend you read them all.”
— RT Book Reviews ****
“An excellent collection of stories.”
— Weird Fiction Review
“A truly outstanding writer.”
— Locus
“Throughout his bounteous career, Jeffrey Ford has fully figured out which experiments work, and in what direction; the miracle is that he has also figured out how to rewrite the rulebook with his own brand of magic.”
— Alvaro Zinos-Amaro, IGMS
“Delightful, terrifying, thoughtful and incredibly well written. Jeffrey Ford's style is eloquent and accessible, literary and engaging. His stories have an engrossing, almost mythological feel to them, strengthened by well-placed descriptions, impeccable pacing and Ford's rare talent for delivering a satisfying ending.” — Catherine Grant, Huffington Post
“No one writes more beautifully about American nightmares and dreams. Every story is great but my favorites are ‘Word Doll,' ‘Rocket Ship to Hell,' ‘The Last Triangle,' and — especially — ‘The Prelate's Commission.' Ford takes ideas that most writers would cling to and milk for three or four or five hundred pages and tosses them off left and right like they were nothing on his way to new worlds he seems to create out of thin air. If these stories weren't so god damn enjoyable they'd make me jealous as hell.” — Ben Loory, author of Stories for Nighttime and Some for the Day
“Jeffrey Ford is a beautifully disorienting writer, a poet in an unclassifiable genre—his own.”—Joyce Carol Oates
“Jeffrey Ford is a true heir to his teacher, John Gardner—not only in his ability to inhabit an astonishing range of styles and different worlds with jaw-dropping verisimilitude, but also in the great-hearted compassion and depth that he brings to his characters. I have long admired and learned from his work, and I'm grateful to have these beautiful stories to contemplate.”—Dan Chaon
“Combining legend and suspense, terror and darkly comic social commentary, Jeffrey Ford brings our greatest fears to life in this terrific collection. A Natural History of Hell is jammed with stories I wish I had written.”—Kit Reed

“For lovers of the weird and fantastic and lovers of great writing, this is a treasure trove of disturbing visions, new worlds and fully realized craft.”—Shelf Awareness (Starred Review)
“Properly creepy, but from time to time deliciously funny and heart-breakingly poignant, too.”—Kirkus Reviews (Starred Review)
“Surreal, unsettling, and more than a little weird. Ford has a rare gift for evoking mood with just a few well-chosen words and for creating living, breathing characters with only a few lines of dialogue.” —Booklist
“Children are the original magic realists. The effects that novelists of a postmodern bent must strive for come naturally to the young, a truth given inventive realization in this wonderful quasi-mystery tale by Jeffrey Ford.” — Boston Globe on The Shadow Year
“Jeffrey Ford s latest triumph, The Shadow Year, is as haunting as it is humorous readers will recognize real talent in Ford s vivid, unerring voice.” —Louisville Courier Journal on The Shadow Year
“Superb, heartbreaking, and masterfully written . . . It s proof of Jeffrey Ford s narrative power that, ultimately, the distinction [between real and invented] doesn t much matter. His made-up world trumps ours.” — Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction
“The Shadow Year captures the totality of a lived period, its actualities and its dreams, its mundane essentials and its odd subjective imperatives; it is a work of episodic beauty and mercurial significance.”–Nick Gevers, Locus
“Jeffrey Ford is one of the few writers who uses wonder instead of ink in his pen.”— Jonathan Carroll, author of The Wooden Sea
“Unusual and provocative…sometimes shocking, sometimes mesmerizing, sometimes humorous, this collection will please fans of Raymond Carver and Flannery O'Connor. Recommended.” — School Library Journal on The Drowned Life
“Spooky and hypnotic…Recommended for all public libraries.” — Library Journal
“Ford travels deep into the wild country that is childhood in this novel …the observations and adventures of these sharp, wayward children provide more than enough depth to be satisfying.” — New York Times on The Shadow Year

LONDON (Reuters) - A first-in-class drug from Amgen based on a tumour-killing virus was given a green light by European regulators on Friday, paving the way for its approval within a couple of months.

The decision is a further milestone for a technology that has long fascinated scientists but has previously proved difficult to harness.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its experts had recommended approval of Imlygic, also known as talimogene laherparepvec or “T-Vec”, for treating melanoma, making it another option among several new drugs for the most deadly form of skin cancer.
“Viral immunotherapy represents a completely new way of treating cancer, so it's extremely exciting to see T-Vec become the first treatment of this type to gain the green light from European regulators,” said Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London.
The drug is recommended for treating melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery and has spread without affecting internal organs.
Imlygic uses a herpes simplex virus, the type that causes cold sores, which has been modified to only infect cancer cells. It is injected directly into tumours where it replicates and causes cancer cells to rupture and die, also stimulating a system-wide immune response.
Until three years ago, chemotherapy was the only available treatment for patients whose melanoma had spread. But recently there have been a number of new treatments, including immunotherapies, BRAF V600 inhibitors and MEK inhibitors.
Despite this progress, the EMA said there was still a need for new treatments with acceptable safety profiles to continue to improve the outlook for patients.
Amgen said melanoma remained one of the most difficult-to-treat cancers, often requiring the use of multiple treatments.
In clinical tests, Imlygic has shrunk tumours but it has not yet been shown to extend lives.
“Exploratory analysis in these patients suggested improvements in survival in patients treated with Imlygic, however this is not yet fully clear,” the EMA said. “Imlygic has also not been compared with other recently approved medicines for melanoma, which have shown beneficial effects on survival.”
Amgen's product was recommended by an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April and the U.S. agency is due to give its verdict on whether to approve the medicine by Oct. 27.
Amgen secured rights to Imlygic after buying BioVex for up to $1 billion in 2011, marking a notable bet on so-called oncolytic virus technology in the wake of earlier disappointments. Onyx Pharmaceuticals had a big setback in the field in 2003 with a product called ONYX-015, a modified common cold virus.
Other companies working on cancer-fighting viruses include Oncolytics Biotech, SillaJen, Targovax and Genelux.
Among Mr. Sauer's discoveries was this item from The Little Times of November 1925: “The Misses Rauch and Embree of the Art Department and Miss Brydon of the Personnel Department have become so skilled with the pistol that some of the more experienced members of the club refuse to enter into competition for fear that they will suffer by comparison.”

With the benefit of a few more days of research than Mr. Sauer had, we looked a bit further into the life of Miss Embree, who appeared in the pictures to have been the most fearsome of the competitors.
Born in Princeton, Ind., in 1893, she attended the well-regarded John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis (now the Herron School of Art and Design). She came to New York in 1917 to further her studies, living with her sister Louise and working as a commercial artist. For five years, Miss Embree was employed by The Times.
Her life changed profoundly in the early 1930s. Louise wrote a biography of George Washington, to which Clotilde contributed silhouette-style illustrations. She then married Claude Funk, a childhood friend from Princeton, and finished the drawings during their honeymoon. She returned to Indiana in 1931. And in 1932, E.P. Dutton published “A Child's Life of George Washington.”
“It is surprising how much dramatic interest is contained in some of the black and white sketches, how much pathos has been put into some, and how much cheerfulness and liveliness into others,” The Indiana Magazine of History said in its review of the book.
Terence E. Hanley picks up the story on his Indiana Illustrators and Hoosier Cartoonists blog. “Clotilde Embree was off on a new career,” he wrote. “Over the next three decades, Clotilde illustrated more than 60 children's books. She drew the pictures for some of the first in the ‘Childhood of Famous Americans' series published by the Bobbs-Merrill Company of Indianapolis.” Her works included:
• “Luther Burbank: Boy Wizard”
• “George Carver: Boy Scientist”
• “Tom Jefferson: A Boy in Colonial Days”
If your job is in manufacturing, medicine, mining, automotive repair, underwater or space exploration, maybe even elder care, some of your coworkers are probably semi-autonomous programmable mechanical machines–in a word, robots. But humans and robots don't understand each other well, and they work very differently: a robot does exactly what it's told, over and over, taking the same amount of time every time, while a human acts with intention, deliberation, and variation. Their strengths and weaknesses can be complementary, but only if they each have good models of how the other works.
In a breakthrough experiment, the Interactive Robotics Group at MIT discovered that cross-training, which is swapping jobs with someone else on your team to help everyone understand the work better, works even when your coworker doesn't have a mind. In short, when humans and robots model doing each other's job they end up working together more smoothly.
“What we suspect, and are planning to follow up on, is that the real benefit is coming from adaptation on the human side”
In order for this to work, researchers first had to program robots to learn by watching humans instead of just through feedback. Humans were paired with a robotic arm, named Abbie, to practice placing the screws and screwing them in–in a virtual environment. There were two basic rhythms to the task: either have Abbie fasten the screw right after it was placed (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), or place all three screws and then have Abbie screw in the batch of three (1-2-3, 1-2-3). After the humans modeled their actions, and the robots practiced placing the screws, the team moved to a real environment where humans placed screws and Abbie screwed them in.
The outcome was fascinating. In the control group, the humans and robots move like awkward dance partners. The human isn't sure where the robot will go next, and doesn't want a screw driven through her hand, so she spends more time waiting around while Abbie is moving.
The team that had cross-trained understood each other's preferences much better. They spent 71 percent more time moving at the same moment, a sign of better coordination–like a well-oiled machine, you might say. The humans spent 41 percent less time waiting around for the robot's next action. The humans rated the robot's performance higher, and the robots had a lower “entropy level,” meaning they spent less time in uncertainty about what the humans would do next.
“What we suspect, and are planning to follow up on, is that the real benefit is coming from adaptation on the human side,” said MIT professor Julie Shah, who leads the Interactive Robotics Group. “The person is doing actions in a more repeatable way, developing a better understanding of what the robot can do.”

Here's a piece of good news in the fight to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour: Walmart's U.S. president, Bill Simon, said last week that the nation's largest employer, will not oppose such an increase.
This isn't really a surprise, in that Walmart spokespeople have been saying for a while that the company would be neutral in this fight. But it does feel counter-intuitive in the grand scheme of things.
So why is Walmart standing down?
The reason Simon gave is that the company "is not a minimum wage payer," and that only about 5,000 of its employees actually make the minimum wage. That answer sounds like great PR, but is meaningless, since what really matters is how many of Walmart's workers are currently paid under $10.10 an hour. And the answer is: a lot, although hard numbers about Walmart pay are extremely hard to come by. (One market research group pegged the average pay for a Walmart associate at $8.81 an hour in 2011.)
Not only would a higher minimum wage raise pay for workers who make less than $10.10, it would also exert upward pressure on wages for many other workers at Walmart. So Walmart definitely does have a big economic stake here.
But that stake may not be what it seems, and the giant retailer may benefit if all low-wage Americans -- its prime customer base -- sees wage increases. And Walmart seems to realize exactly that. As Bloomberg reported in February:
Wal-Mart is weighing the impact of additional payroll costs against possibly attracting more consumer dollars to its stores, David Tovar , a company spokesman, said today in a telephone interview. Increasing the minimum wage means that some of the 140 million people who shop at the chain weekly would “now have additional income,” Tovar said.
That's exactly the kind of argument the Demos made in its groundbreaking report on wages in the retail sector back in 2012. The report pointed out that better paid retail workers would turn around and spend some of their gains in the very stores where they worked. And if wages went up for all low-wage workers, that could mean big boost: Walmart's increased labor costs for hundreds of thousands of workers may be easily offset by more spending by tens of millions of flusher customers.
Surely the other factor guiding Walmart on the minimum wage is public relations. Publicly opposing a minimum wage hike would add to the company's image as being anti-worker. Which is to say that the pressure on Walmart by pro-worker groups is having an effect.
A few other big employers are also changing behavior as the plight of low-wage workers is pulled into the spotlight. Gap Inc. said earlier this year that it would raise the minimum at its stores to $10 an hour.
One question, though, is about how these companies are acting within the business associations they belong to, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Walmart's neutrality on the minimum wage is nice, but not if it's quietly bankrolling lobbying efforts to kill any increase in Congress.
Since the Chamber doesn't disclose its donors, much less how specific funds are used, we don't know what's going on there.
IndyCar's only owner/driver was sharing Chevy's testing duties with fulltime Ed Carpenter Racing teammate Spencer Pigot and Team Penske's Josef Newgarden, the first time they had tried the new superspeedway package. Last month the ECR pair and Penske's Will Power tested the short-oval aerokit at Phoenix.
Carpenter, who won at TMS in 2014, told IndyCar.com: “There's obviously a lot that's changed since we were here before, still figuring out [the new car], to be honest.
“Compared to Phoenix, it's not as different here, but it's definitely still different. It has a different feel. Like, the way you drove it at Phoenix was probably a little more different than here, but it makes downforce in such a different way that the way that you sense the feedback and stuff from the car, to me, is a little different.”
Reigning IndyCar champion Newgarden, who will carry #1 next year but was still testing as #2, stated: “I wouldn't say it feels drastically different from a feel standpoint. I think this type of oval will be less of a change than some of the other tracks with the aero configurations, but there are small differences just running by ourselves. I'm sure I'll have more of a feeling difference when I get to run in traffic.
“We're just working through different aero sweeps,” Newgarden continued. “Understanding what it does with where we were last year and where we're probably going to go as a series next year, as far as downforce levels and were the series is going to want us at.”
Amazon.com Inc. is said to be working on its first wearable device, a pair of smart glasses that will interact with its virtual assistant Alexa, according to the Financial Times, citing people familiar with the plans.
The device, designed to look like a normal pair of glasses, would allow the users to summon Alexa at anytime, anywhere, using bone-conduction technology so there would no need for earphones or conventional speakers, the report said.
The U.S. retail and tech giant AMZN, +0.21% is also said to be expanding its “smart home” hardware product line with a new home-security camera that would allow users to view the video feed on their Echo Show screen.
Both the Alexa glasses and security camera could be launched by the end of the year, according to the FT, alongside other updates to Echo products.
Amazon shares were 0.2% higher in thin premarket trade on Wednesday.
In other Amazon news, the retailer earlier this week accidentally sent out baby registry emails for people with no babies on the way.

Almost 40 per cent of Australian jobs could be replaced by technology by 2025, report finds
Updated
Technology could make almost 40 per cent of Australian jobs, including highly skilled roles, redundant in 10 to 15 years, a new report has found.
The Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) report highlighted the need for more funding and a cooperative approach to prepare for huge changes in the workforce.
Almost five million jobs face a high probability of being replaced in the next two decades, while a further 18.4 per cent of the workforce had a "medium probability" of their jobs being eliminated, the report found.
CEDA chief executive Professor Stephen Martin said the world was on the cusp of another industrial revolution being driven by technology, and it was not just low-paid, manual jobs at risk.
"What we've found is that going right through to dentists, and clergy and chemical engineers — and, dare I say, even editors or newspaper proprietors and, heaven forbid, even economists — all of these are in grave danger of perhaps outliving their usefulness," Professor Martin said.
The report said jobs that involved "low levels of social interaction, low levels of creativity, or low levels of mobility and dexterity" were most likely to be replaced by automation.
While automation had already replaced many jobs in manufacturing, agriculture and mining, in the coming decades industries such as the health sector would also be impacted, it was found.
"Health is an especially significant area likely to be impacted, through automation in clinical data and predictive diagnostics (analysis roles), to robotics assisting in areas from surgery to nursing and from hospital logistics to pharmaceutical dispensary," the report said.
The report found that advances in technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data were largely driving the change.
Autonomous driving to revolutionise labour market
With approximately a quarter of Australians employed in jobs involving driving, the patenting of a driverless car by Google, enabled by big data, could profoundly change the labour market, the report found.
"Based on the progression of Moore's Law, we shall see computing technology improve approximately 10,000-fold over the next 20 years," the report said. "The affordability of autonomous driving systems will improve dramatically. "Furthermore, if the statistic that 90 per cent of road accidents are caused by human error is correct, governments will inevitably regulate that such systems are mandatory because of the savings to life and health costs."
CEDA estimated that in December 2012, of the 11.5 million Australians employed nationally, about 28 per cent had jobs that involved driving.
Australian driving jobs: Commercial vehicles (excluding motorcycles) 3,266,521 Commercial motorcycles 10,000 Train drivers 11,900 Total: 3,288,421
If all vehicles become autonomous in the next 20 years, the report said, those jobs would need to change as the "human skill of driving a vehicle is no longer an essential part of the job".
"The customer service aspects of the job will become far more important," the report said.
If Parliament did not start shaping workplace policy around technological changes, the country would be left behind, Professor Martin warned.
"Every other country in the world is going to be faced with the same sorts of challenges, particularly in the era of globalisation," he said.
"We simply can not sit back and say a short-term political cycle will solve the problem. There are many deep and grave issues that this country needs to face to retain its economic first world status.
"We are competing with the rest of the world and tech disruption is going to affect us just like it's going to affect everyone else."
The CEDA report said Australia had adapted well to the impact of changing technologies on the workforce so far.
"The nation created over six times the number of jobs it lost over the five years to June 2014," the report said.
"We generally know where the jobs are being lost, and knowing which jobs are a lost cause is important to avoid investing expensive tertiary education in the wrong areas and scarce investment capital that could go into growth industries."
But the report said where the new jobs would be and why they were being created was the most important challenge for future governments.

When was the last time you were surprised by a game? Actually, let's get more specific: when was the last time you were genuinely taken aback by a narrative or mechanical development in a big budget console game?
For me, it was Assassin's Creed 3. If you've played it, you'll know what I'm talking about; if not, I won't spoil it in case you eventually do. Suffice to say for a game so heavily promoted, so frequently detailed and discussed in previews, trailers and promotional clips to suddenly offer something unknown felt like quite the achievement, particularly in this day and age where internet archaeologists regularly unearth hidden treasures before publishers are ready to reveal them. I respected Ubisoft for managing to keep a lid on it, even if that respect evaporated through the remainder of the game.
But I digress. After a while I began to wonder whether the impact of the surprise had something to do with the fact that almost everything else in the game was a known quantity. I knew about the naval battles, about the treasure-seeking missions. I knew about the enormous sandbox environment that connected the two main cities and the hunting asides therein. I knew which historic events formed the backbone of the narrative. I knew not only the protagonist's name, but almost everything about his character. Heck, Ubisoft itself manages to spoil a key plot twist with an entry in the Animus database - admittedly, I didn't notice that until after the fact, but those immersed in the lore will likely have made that discovery a little earlier than planned.
Compare and contrast, if you will, with the approach of Swedish studio Simogo, which felt pressed to explain the lack of information surrounding its forthcoming iOS title Year Walk. In a blog entry posted last month, artist/composer Simon Flesser explained his company's stance.
Deadly Premonition's marketing campaign focused more on the diverse critical reaction than the game, which itself contained a spoiler for sharp-eyed players: a number plate gives an early hint to the secret identity of a certain character.
"We personally feel that a lot of the reporting on games is very spoilerish, and we've had a lot of gaming experiences lessened by that fact," said Flesser. "Of course we realise that we cannot decide whether you decide to watch preview videos or not (and that decision should totally be up to you!), but we believe that the element of surprise and discovery in Year Walk is one of its biggest appeals, and we do not want to take that away from you."
It's an argument I'm wholly sympathetic to - even if, oddly enough, the blog ends up revealing a few tidbits I'd rather not know. Like Flesser, I too "miss the days when we played games without knowing every little detail about them before starting to play". Sure, in the internet age it's often difficult to avoid spoilers, but publishers and developers are often so eager to spill the beans that you can find out things you've actively been trying not to discover.
The drip-feed of character announcements for Batman: Arkham City is one such example, but it's far from the worst. The potentially iconic moment in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed where Starkiller Force-pulls a Star Destroyer into crashing might have carried greater weight had an image of that very scene not featured on most of the promotional materials. (If you want more examples, head over to TV Tropes for a more comprehensive list.)
I've heard friends and colleagues say they're heartily sick of certain games before they've even arrived thanks to the overwhelming volume of marketing that surrounds them. Little wonder, when campaigns can and do begin upwards of 18 months before a game's release. I'd be tempted to dismiss this as a hazard of the profession - we writers have our own roles to play in controlling the flow of information, of course - but for the fact that I've heard others make similar complaints. Even outside the enthusiast bubble, it's increasingly difficult to go into a game completely cold.
I fully understand why publishers do this. Games are expensive, after all, and in the current market where the fate of a studio can rest on the performance of a single title, it's crucial to communicate a game's appeal to the widest possible audience. The best way of doing that, of course, is to show it off, and whether it's in the form of promotional footage or a round of previews and interviews, the result is the same: the reader/viewer is better appraised about the nature and content of the game, which can thus inform a purchasing decision. It's understandable that people want to know what they're letting themselves in for when they're spending north of £40.
The pre-release demo for Bioshock was a fine playable teaser, but by featuring one of the game's most iconic sequences - the bathysphere descent into Rapture - it arguably dulled its impact in the full game.
Perhaps that's the key difference between marketing big budget games and cinema: people are more willing to take a chance on a film they might not like because the investment is significantly less. Having said that, Hollywood is equally guilty of showing its hand too soon: we've all seen trailers that are little more than three-minute synopses of a film's plot.
And besides, is the glut of information that spews forth at every expired embargo really all that different to getting the new issue of Super Play or Amiga Power and poring over every bit of information about an anticipated title? Sure, we had to rely on static images and words back then, but getting excited about a forthcoming game has always been part of the fun.
Even so, I'd like to think it's possible for publishers to show a little restraint from time to time. In one respect it's arguably easier for the likes of Simogo to keep things quiet: certainly I've felt that all-important sense of discovery more frequently on iOS of late, though when it comes to taking a leap into the unknown, it helps that the price barrier is so easy to clear. But then again, in a market where small developers have to shout to let their games be heard above the noise, such a low-key approach is a definite risk. It's clearly an artistically motivated rather than a commercially driven decision, and if you ask me, that's something to be celebrated.
Can bigger games afford to be so brave? Perhaps it's naïve of me to think so, but I'm convinced that it's possible for marketers to maximise a game's commercial prospects without stymieing its creative potential. Hopefully, lessons can be learned from Ubisoft's misdirection and Simogo's secrecy, and perhaps then big budget console games will be able to amaze us with their content as much as their technical competence.
Dozens of people came together at the Memorial Complex “Eternity” in Chisinau on March 2 to commemorate the heroes killed in the war for defending Moldova's integrity and independence and the victims of this conflict. Those attending observed a minute's silence, IPN reports.
Moldova's first President Mircea Snegur said that 23 years ago, enjoying massive political, logistic and military support from Russia, the separatists from the left side of the Nistru River provoked a war. “We didn't want that war. On the contrary, we made colossal effort to remove the misunderstandings and disagreements with the leaders from Tiraspol in a peaceful way. God and history are our witnesses. Regretfully, they didn't understand us and chose the war. We could not only monitor the wrongdoings committed by local and Russian bandits. You, dear combatants, did it right when you rose to defend Moldova's integrity and sovereignty,” he stated.
Current President Nicolae Timofti expressed his regret at the fact that the Moldovan constitutional authorities do not yet control that territory for which they struggled in 1990-1992. “We know that we did our duty and fought out of patriotism. It was an unequal battle for the territory that belongs to us lawfully. In these conditions, an important thing we can do it to transmit the information about those events to our children,” he said.
Prime Minister Chiril Gaburici said he has separate respect for the heroes killed in battle. “We cannot forget them because they are those who struggled for Moldova's independence, territorial integrity and for democracy. I bend in front of all those who took part in that war,” he stated.
On Memory Day, a service was held at the Cathedral “Saint Teodora of Sihla” in Chisinau. Afterward, flowers were laid at the monument to Ruler Stephan the Great and Holy. Commemoration meals were held in all the districts of Chisinau. Commemoration events were also staged in settlements that had been battlefields.
The Nistru armed conflict began on March 2, 1992. The ceasefire agreement between Moldova and Russia was signed on July 21, 1992. According to the Moldovan authorities, 287 persons were killed and about 3,500 were injured in this conflict. Another 40 persons were listed as missing.

Melted butter
Cinnamon sugar
Read John 19 while the oven is preheating to 350.
Unroll the crescent rolls and place on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Explain that this is like the cloth they wrapped Jesus in.
Give your child a marshmallow and explain that it represents Jesus,
all white and pure because He was without sin.
Roll the marshmallows in the melted butter.
This symbolizes the embalming oils.
Roll the marshmallows in the cinnamon sugar.
This is like the spices used to prepare his body for burial.
Wrap the marshmallow in the crescent roll cloth, pinching the dough together securely. This represents how they wrapped Jesus' body.
Put the rolls in the oven (symbolizing the tomb) and bake for 12 minutes.
While the rolls are baking, read John 20:1-18.
Open the tomb and remove the rolls. When they're cool enough to handle, break one open and discover what happened to the marshmallow.
JESUS IS RISEN!
Happy Easter!

Louisville Metro Police, who have been giving warnings to jaywalkers at targeted intersections in recent months, are about to start issuing citations with fines ranging from $20 to $100.
Police say they are monitoring five of the city's most dangerous intersections to keep pedestrians safe, a year after 18 pedestrians were killed. Eleven have been killed so far this year.
But construction worker Jerry Manns, 34, said he wasn't impressed with the idea.
"This is just ridiculous," he said. "I've never heard of anything like this before."
Rather, police "should concentrate on real problems, like drugs and theft and break-ins."
Since late spring, officers have been writing citations for drivers who fail to properly yield and giving warnings and educational leaflets to jaywalkers at the five busy intersections that data suggest can be troublesome for pedestrians, said Lt. Joe Seelye, Traffic Unit commander.
The "pedestrian decoy operation" is a collaboration with Metro Public Works and is part of a larger grant-funded initiative Look Alive Louisville, which launched earlier this year aiming to keep motorists and pedestrians safe as they navigate city streets.
"We're going to use common sense here," he said. "We're truly just trying to keep people safe and educate them."
Officers at two of the intersections — Fourth and Market street and Fourth Street and Broadway — warned pedestrians of the impending change Tuesday morning.
"You have just failed to use due care as a pedestrian," read one side of the police leaflets handed out to those walking and driving who violated state law meant to keep pedestrians safe. "You have just failed to STOP for a pedestrian," read the other.
The officers Tuesday were uniformed, but the full roll-out will include undercover officers who will walk crosswalks to issue citations to those on foot and notify nearby hidden police of vehicles that break the law, said Rolf Eisinger, bicycle and pedestrian coordinator with the Public Works Department.
Lisa Toby, 56, said she thinks the fines could serve as a deterrent to breaking the rules.
"As a mother of two teenage sons, I think it's good to educate people, especially the younger lot, about road safety," she said. "I see a lot of people jaywalking every day and if they're fined they'll think twice about doing such a thing again."
Seelye stressed officers are going to focus on "obvious" infractions, such when drivers run red lights and cut off pedestrians in crosswalks or when pedestrians "clearly aren't using the crosswalk" and use a crosswalk when the orange hand is illuminated.
Seelye said early data suggests the police presence has reduced the number of vehicles that run red lights at the five busy intersections — Bardstown Road and Goldsmith Lane; Preston Highway and Gilmore Lane; Second Street and Broadway; Fourth and Market streets and Fourth Street and Broadway.

The initiative is funded by a $307,000, three-year grant from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that is helping to fund Look Alive Louisville, which is focusing on education using videos and programming.
Eisinger said many on the road who break pedestrian laws are distracted by technology or simply in a rush. In the months ahead, he said officials will look to see if behavior changes at the five intersections as a measure of success.
“Get you head out of you app and pay attention to your surroundings,” Eisinger said. "These things are pretty elementary, but it could save your life.”
About 13 percent of the 1,100 pedestrians who crossed the intersections at Fourth Street and Broadway and Fourth and Market streets during four hours Tuesday morning did something illegal, Seelye said.
LMPD data suggests that pedestrians are at fault in roughly 30 to 40 percent of pedestrian issues, he said.
"A lot of people blame each other," Seelye said. "There's ownership on both sides. There's opportunity to improve on both sides."
STATE LAW
For pedestrians
"Pedestrians shall be subject to traffic and pedestrian-control signals..."
Those who cross "at a point other than within a marked crosswalk or within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles upon the roadway."
"Between adjacent intersections within the city limits of every city at which traffic-control signals are in operation, pedestrians shall not cross at any place except in a marked crosswalk."
Pedestrians should not "suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety" nor "cross a roadway intersection diagonally."
For motorists
With no traffic control signals, "a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way, slowing down or stopping if need be to so yield, to a pedestrian..."
"The operator of a vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to any pedestrian on a sidewalk."
"...every operator of a vehicle shall exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian and shall give warning by sounding the horn when necessary..."
When a vehicle is stopped at a crosswalk to allow a pedestrian to cross, "the operator of any other vehicle approaching from the rear shall not overtake and pass the stopped vehicle."
