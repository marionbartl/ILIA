MARCH 29 — The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (the Commission ) notes the execution of Gunasegar Pitchaymuthu, Ramesh Jayakumar and Sasivarnam Jayakumar on 25 March 2016 under section 302 of the Penal Code, read together with section 34 of the same Code.
The Commission expresses regret in this regard as only recently in November 2015, Minister in the Prime Minister s Department, YB Hajah Nancy Shukri announced that the Government was in the midst of finalising amendments to remove the mandatory death penalty in relevant laws. The Bill was expected to be tabled at the current (March 2016) Parliamentary session. Today, over two thirds of the world s nations have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.
The Commission is concerned because the mandatory imposition of the death penalty violates the basic right to life, as enshrined in international human rights laws as it constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of life, as well as denies judges the possibility of taking into account the facts of the offence or the characteristics of each individual offender. Instead, each offender is sentenced to death regardless of any mitigating circumstances that may apply.
While discussions on abolishing the mandatory death penalty in the country continue, the Commission cautions that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable. Further, the rationale that the death penalty acts as a deterrent has been discredited and dismissed on several occasions.
The Commission therefore recommends that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty be put in place that will at the very least, contribute to the respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of human rights in Malaysia.

NC Superior Court Judge Arnold Ogden Jones, II arrested and indicted on charges of bribing an FBI officer
North Carolina Superior Court Judge Arnold Ogden Jones, II was arrested Wednesday, following a grand jury indictment Tuesday on charges that they bribed an FBI officer.
Jones is the Superior Court Judge for Wayne, Lenoir and Greene counties. According to court documents, in October, they sent a text message to an FBI officer, asking them to access and make copies of text messages of two telephone numbers.
Law enforcement officers are prohibited from getting telephone records without a search warrant and then only if there is probable cause that they contain evidence of a crime. Court documents state that Jones told the FBI officer it was a family matter and they wanted to keep it on the “down low.” They promised the officer their involvement would never be disclosed and the two agreed on a couple of cases of beer as payment. In November, the FBI officer met Jones in Goldsboro to give them a disk that supposedly contained the text messages and Jones paid the officer $100 in lieu of the beer.
Department of Justice officials say the FBI agent acted as an investigator throughout the incident and will not be charged. Jones, who co-chairs the Innocence Inquiry Commission, is not being held. They face a maximum of 37 years in prison and fines totaling $750,000.
We now live in a world so afraid to “offend” that we can no longer call little girls “girls,” nor little boys “boys.” Seems rational …
As the Daily Wire reported weeks ago, a North Carolina school district has decided to go all-in on transgenderism--with help from "The Gender Unicorn" site--directing their teachers to never refer to students as “boys and girls,” but as “scholars” or “students” instead.
Capitulating to President Obama's lawless transgender edict from May—which mandates that students use the restroom and locker-room facilities which correspond to their “gender identity” rather than biology—the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School Board added a host of radical trans policies in addition to putting the kibosh on “boys and girls”—some policies that directly defy North Carolina state law.
Here are some of the most drastic policies highlighted by the NC Values Coalition:
1. Parental involvement dependent on student's permission: "Involvement of parents in the plan is determined in working with the student, considering the student's age and health, wellbeing and safety concerns" (pg. 34).
2. Students can choose their bathrooms and changing facilities: "Students must have access to the restroom/changing facilities that correspond to their gender identity" (pg. 42).
3. CMS will remove some gender-based activities: "CMS will evaluate all gender-based activities; maintain only those that have clear and sound pedagogical purpose" (pg. 46).
4. Students can choose their gender-based activities (intramural sports, dress codes, classes, ceremonies, photos, extracurricular activities, etc). This includes choosing which gender they participate with during overnight field trips: "Students are permitted to participate in gender-based activities consistent with their gender identity." (pg. 46).
5. Students shall not be referred to as "boys and girls" in classrooms, but "scholars" or "students." : "Avoid gender specific classroom management techniques" (pg. 46).
The school board's policy which mandates students be allowed to use the bathroom and locker-room facilities that correspond to their claimed “gender identity” directly violates state law: HB2.
North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory blasted the school board for their lawless regulations:
“Instead of providing reasonable accommodations for some students facing unique circumstances, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg School System made a radical change to their shower, locker room and restroom policy for all students,” said Graham Wilson, McCrory's press secretary. “(CMS) should have waited for the courts to make a decision instead of purposely breaking state law.”
The North Carolina Values Coalition also condemned Charlotte-Mecklenburg:
"Superintendent Ann Clark has chosen to violate the state's HB 2 law instead of following common sense accommodations and limiting restrooms and locker rooms to members of the same sex for privacy and safety reasons without violating Title IX," said Tami Fitzgerald, the president of NCVC.
"Every child deserves a safe space, and it's our duty as parents to fight for their right to privacy. Charlotte-Mecklenburg's proposed new policy allowing students to use opposite-sex restrooms, locker rooms and showers will seriously endanger students' privacy and safety, undermine parental authority, and severely impair an environment conducive to learning,” added Fitzgerald. "The district should continue their current policy to offer accommodations to students that have different preferences without compromising the privacy rights of all other students.”

-by Jennifer Monteagudo, Staff Writer; Image: Gwinnett Christian Academy, a private, religious school in Georgia that taught parents how to ‘game' the system to get scholarships for their non-needy children (Image Source: CaptureGwinnett.com)
In the state of Georgia, public funds that should be going to public schools are being diverted into private institutions, and often, religious ones, for children who aren't always needy, the New York Times reported yesterday.
According to the paper, Georgia's “private school scholarship program,” which began in 2008, has been misused.
Although originally intended so that children of lower income bracket families would not be forced to attend failing public schools, and could receive financial aid to go to private schools, what is happening instead is parents of children already enrolled in private schools are applying for scholarships after contributing to the scholarship program. When contributing, parents “receive dollar-for-dollar tax credits, up to $2,500 a couple.”
The outcome, is that public money is being diverted from public schools, to help non-needy children and families receive scholarships to schools that they're sometimes already in. “Spreading at a time of deep cutbacks in public schools...” the paper notes, “the programs [operating in eight states] redirected nearly $350 million that would have gone into public budgets.”
Though these scholarship programs are still used to help needy children, “the money has also been used to attract star football players... and spread the theology of creationism.” The Times also notes that “most of the private schools are religious.”
It is “nonprofit scholarship groups,” not the state, through which money exchanges hands, meaning “the programs are insulated from provisions requiring church-state separation.” These nonprofit groups may not always be ethical, as well, since some collect “hundreds of thousands of dollars in administrative fees.”
Critics of these programs say they are political, and specifically, conservative in nature, funneling money away from public schools to religious private schools; some have even implied that the intention of these programs was never to help needy children, but to promote religious conservatism while crippling public education.
In Florida, the issue has divided state legislators along political lines. In March, according to the Palm Beach Post News, the “Republican-ruled House” expanded its “corporate-tax-credit private-school-voucher program, with Democrats decrying the move to pull dollars from the state treasury that could go to public schools.”
According to the Post News, “as of November [2011], 1,181 private schools participated” in the program, with scholarships going to over 37,000 students. Like in neighbor state Georgia, Florida's education budget has been drastically decreased in the last few years. In 2011, Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature cut $1.3 billion from Florida public schools.
Precisely how many more of these stories do we need to see?
Out in Nebraska, Senator Ben Sasse is up in arms after an illegal immigrant accused of killing a woman with their car while driving drunk was released from custody and then failed to show up for court mandated appointments. Who could have possibly seen that one coming? (Fox News)
Immigration officials have placed a 19-year-old Honduran who entered the United States as part of the so-called border surge of 2014 on its Most Wanted list for disappearing while out on bail on charges of killing a Nebraska woman while driving drunk. But Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) says the action by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is too little, too late. On their website Sasse said that Edwin Mejia, whose whereabouts are unknown and also goes by the name Eswin, should never have been released after they killed 21-year-old Sarah Root in January while they're driving drunk at a high speed. Root had graduated from college just hours before the fatal accident.
Sasse has every reason to be upset. The police knew that Mejia was an illegal alien as soon as they were picked up. At their initial hearing, despite objections from prosecutors, the Honduran “undocumented immigrant” was released on bail with an order to show up for Breathalyzer testing twice per day until their next court appearance. They never saw them again.
How on Earth could the court not even suspect that someone who had just been identified as being in the country illegally while killing a woman with their car might go on the lam? More to the point, where was ICE during all of this? As Sasse correctly notes, immigration control has the option to place a detainer on illegals as soon as they are in custody, allowing the local cops to hold them until ICE can show up, take them into custody and hold them for either further criminal prosecution or deportation hearings. The Douglas County Police Department supposedly put in a request with ICE to do just that, but they passed on the opportunity, saying that the culprit's actions, “did not meet ICE's enforcement priorities.”
Given the marching orders coming out of the White House for the past couple of years, you can almost understand how they might have allowed Meijia to walk if he'd simply been picked up for a bar brawl or some other minor infraction, but we're supposed to be holding on to felons, aren't we? And this guy was in a cell because he'd just killed somebody. (Allegedly) This isn't San Francisco or some other “sanctuary city” we're talking about here. It's Omaha, Nebraska. The problem wasn't the locals in this case, but ICE itself and their refusal to do what's called for when we've got an illegal alien in a cell with ample evidence to suspect they are guilty of a serious crime.
Don't pin this one on Mayor Jean Stothert or the city council. This is a failure of policy at the federal level and it's sadly not the only case of its kind out there. The locals can only do so much if they can't secure the help of the feds and immigration control.
Monster of the Week is a Powered by the Apocalypse (or PbtA) tabletop gaming system by Michael Sands in which players tell a collaborative story about monster hunters, a la Supernatural or the Dresden Files. This is the same engine used in Dungeon World , so the basic mechanics are similar, though Monster of the Week rejects the classes and combat of Dungeons and Dragons while Dungeon World borrows heavily from it. For example damage rolls, full attribute scores and inventories are not present, favoring the simplicity of most PbtA games. Everything you need is included in the single book for the system, and character sheets with included instructions for making a character are both in the book and easily available online.
All rolls are decided using 2d6, with 10+ being a pure success, 7-9 being a success with a complication or cost, and 6- being a failure where the Game Master – or Keeper as they are called in the book – makes a move. Fighting is treated as another skill check with the Kick Some Ass move, which sacrifices some combat detail for streamlining and making playbooks – classes in PbtA – that aren't combat focused viable. Investigation and protecting bystanders are both important enough to have one of the 8 basic moves devoted to them, with a bevy of playbook moves also focused on protecting, investigation, and finding or bypassing the monster's weakness. The monster mystery genre is baked into this system. Adapting this system to other genres is unlikely to work unless there is a reason for mysteries, monsters, and some analogue to a magic system- the game rules assume the presence of all three and are built around it.
Combat is portrayed as fast and lethal- but in practice the hunters are fairly beefy; the only deaths in the campaign I ran were when the characters turned on each other. Players always take damage when fighting and die when they run out of hit points, no save, though they have a limited number of “get out of jail free cards” in luck points. However this danger may be eliminated by some game breaking move combinations, especially from the Monstrous playbook- it does not fit the overall tone or power level of the game very well, and I had a very hard time balancing encounters involving it. I would recommend banning the Monstrous playbook if you are running the game.
In contrast to Dungeons & Dragons and Dungeon World, Monster of the Week offers detailed instructions on setting up individual sessions, a notable improvement that should make this game runnable even by someone who has never played it before. The Sprawl's planing system is even easier to use but MoTW's suggested planning gives a more complete map of what could happen in the session.
However, it is necessary since the mystery format of MoTW involves a great deal more preparation than Dungeon World or other games, where the dungeon structure can simplify preparation greatly. The mystery structure forces a certain amount of rail roading- the players only have agency within the confines of solving the mystery, or the system breaks down; if your players do not like structure this may be a problem. Additionally the “Use Magic” move is the most open ended move in any of the PbtA systems- it needs some attention from the GM both to keep things balanced and to prevent players from getting lost in the endless possibilities.
If you do the prep, 30 minutes on average for me, or use a premade mystery from the book or online, the mystery flows well. There's time for investigation, social scenes and several fights in a 3 hour session. A 2 hour session is possible but will require the Keeper to manage time carefully and keep things moving. I liked running the system a great deal and it reproduced the balance of investigation and fighting while trying to keep the public from catching on you would expect from a monster TV show or an urban fantasy novel in an exciting fashion, feeling true to the genre without being bogged down into mechanics.
Where I ran into trouble was a clash of expectations. Monster of the Week needs more player buy in into the genre than a swords and sorcery game or something else less plot focused. My group essentially had two factions, the people trying to solve the mystery and a team of black ops murder hobos. Since some playbooks trade combat effectiveness for investigation the clash was more serious than in Dungeon World or Dungeons and Dragons where all classes are built and have tools for traditional dungeon delving and adventuring. When violence became the default solution to problems the investigation team felt left out, and the murder hobos felt bored during the investigations.
This management of expectations is always important but is much more so in Monster of the Week where investigation is the meat of the genre. I should have been more aggressive in getting the group on the same page; the book recommends banning certain classes to give a campaign a certain feel. Coming from a Dungeons and Dragons background this felt strange and I didn't do it, which was a mistake. I'm not saying some playbooks can't coexist, but the players have cooperated to make it happen – tell this to your group and if you think it isn't likely, restrict the playbooks to keep everyone on the same page. Obviously the Keeper can create different challenges for different players but if the Monstrous shape shifts during an attempted social encounter or a hunter assaults a journalist trying to interview them It's hard to stop things from devolving into combat without breaking immersion.
Dungeon World's quick leveling is present here as well – experience gain is slower but requirements do not increase as the players level, so campaigns must be planned to be short to keep challenges from being trivialized; that or forced retirement of characters. I ran a 10 session campaign and all the characters were into their advanced moves despite lots of absences.
While Monster of the Week is quick and flexible compared to Dungeons & Dragons and other crunchier systems, it feels very slow compared to other PbtA games. I have played and prefer Dungeon World and The Sprawl to Monster of the Week, though it may simply be that the genre wasn't what my group and I were looking for. It is a good system so if monster hunting seems like something you would like, give it a try.
TL,DR; A fast, streamlined, and easy system- pick it up if you like the monster mystery/hunting genre.

Saturday night on the 28th of October, the October revolution was commemorated with a spontaneous demonstration at Grønland. Grønland is a central, primarily proletarian part of Oslo.
Many people were outside when activists started the action at the Grønland town square. One activist held a speech, while other activists masked themselves with red bandanas, lined up with Tjen Folket's flags and held a banner with the slogan “From October 1917 till today – All for the proletarian revolution!”. The goal was to mark the 100-year anniversary of the Russian revolution in a militant way, underlining the necessity for new revolutions and new workers states today.
During the preparations for the march, security guards tried to intervene without success, before they preceded to call the police. One inhabitant of the apartment building next to the town square also showed discontent. Local activists have experienced the same person trying to sabotage antiracist demonstrations before, one example being during a protest against police violence.
The speech at the town square gathering summarized the October revolution, the new workers state that was created preceding it, as well as attacking Norwegian imperialism, wars against poorer countries, racism and oppression.
Throughout the speech, many youth and other curious people gathered. There were applause several times during the speech, and several people voiced positive comments to the message being conveyed. Some enthusiastic people from the audience spontaneously joined and masked themselves as well.
During the action, multiple activists diligently handed out flyers and talked to people. The text on the flyer was the following:
“Russia 2017 – Worlds first workers state was established through revolution. 100 years later, the revolution lives on in the people's struggle and the fight for new revolutions and workers states.
We stand for all power to the proletariat. To the class that works in cleaning, health service, stores, industry and craftsmanship. With power, we can solve all the problems with wars, crisis, poverty, hunger and the destruction of the environment.
To take power, we need a party of a new type: a communist party, which is the party of the proletariat. We will build the party. We will build red political power. Join us!”
The activists got into conversations with several people, and they also gained new contacts. The handing out of the flyers continued throughout the demonstration, when the activists left Grønland town square and marched through the streets at Grønland and Tøyen.
Red emergency flares were ignited during the demonstration, and the activists shouted slogans like “Death to imperialism, people's war till communism!” and “USA, Terrorist! Israel, Terrorist! Norwegian state, Terrorist!”. Through the megaphone, the purpose of the demonstration was also declared, as well as encouraging people to join the struggle against capitalism.
The end location for the demonstration was “Rudolf Nilsens plass” It is a park dedicated to the communist worker poet Rudolf Nilsen, who died in 1929. They wrote the most prominent communist poetry of their time. Several of those are sung today by Norwegian communists.
With red communist flags, red flares and red slogans, the activists marked the 100-year anniversary of the October Revolution at Rudolf Nilsens east end. On the place where the demonstration was would end.
When the activists arrived at Rudolf Nilsens plass, the demonstration has acquired a tail of blue lights, in stark contrast to the red fire from the flares. The police had gathered their forces and attempted to isolate the activist with the megaphone from the rest of the activists. One activist filmed the incident, and the video has been published on Facebook by Tjen Folket Media. The film shows that there were no troubles with pedestrians, when the police intervened. The activist was quickly set free from the police, the demonstration dissolved and activists ran in all directions.
As this part of Oslo is probably the most policed part of Norway, the police had managed to mobilize many patrols during the span of 15 minutes. Thus, they were able to detain several people. Handcuffs, identification and the customary “good-cop/bad-cop”-routine followed, for the activists that the police managed to catch. One of them remarked that if the flags had swastikas, they probably would have received police escort through Karl Johan instead of this treatment.
Police switched between praising the activists in an attempt to keep things calm, and scaring the youngest participants by saying that the protest was illegal and that it would lead to consequences. The police confiscated multiple flags and red bandanas, and claimed they would be destroyed as they were used in an act of illegality. As usual, they couldn't refer to any legal basis for this claim.
After some time, most activists were released and were able to continue the celebration of the October revolution with a concert and a party throughout the evening.
Pictures of the demonstration has been published on Facebook, by the page, Tjen Folket Media:
Bourgeois media and the police on the demonstration: Local security guards quickly notified the police about the gathering at the Grønland town square, and both police and media showed great confusion.
On Twitter, the police tweeted three messages during the incident:
“We're at Tøyen with several patrols in conjunction with an illegal demonstration. There are fights at the scene, too.”
“We have control. 15 people detained.”
“One person arrested for violations of our orders, one reported for police conviction and the rest dismissed. No one has been hurt.”
The activists never saw any fight. First when the demonstration arrived at Rudolf Nilsens plass, where the plan was to end the demonstration, the police intervened and tried to confiscate the megaphone, banner and other things. Besides the police, no one attacked the activists.
The distortion of reality was propagated in the Media:
“– When the demonstration approached Tøyen, youth that does not like such parades like this in this area, started to gather. Luckily we were quickly on the scene with several units and managed to spread the participants before it escalated,_ says Stokkeli”
From Aftenpostens covering of the case.
The activists didn't notice any discontent from local youth. On the contrary – there was applause during the speech at the gathering at Grønland, and the demonstration received several positive chants and comments from youth that were there. The activists gained new contacts while handing out flyers during the gathering.
Aftenposten writes that “… the police were not notified of the event and it is therefore a formal infringement” which means that it is not a crime and that the infringement can be settled with a warning. But the police of course threatened the activists with saying that it was an “illegal demonstration” and they especially tried to scare young people and people without Norwegian citizenship..
Nettavisen, TV2 and Dagbladet also wrote about the demonstration, and they all spread the same misleading picture as Aftenposten and the police.
This is of course, is nothing new. Bourgeois media and police consistently spread incorrect notions and distortions regarding our actions and activity. We must build our own Medias and encourage everyone to be very critical of what is written in mainstream media.
When asked what regulations the Congressman is currently worried about, they said, “All of them.” However, Paul specifically points to the 1099 provision, a portion of the health-care act, passed earlier in the year. “For every transaction of over $600, gold dealers have to fill out a form, it is a lot of paperwork,” said the member of congress. Entities must file a Form 1099 with the Internal Revenue Service whenever they make transactions paying out $600 a year to another party. US economy It is going to continue to go downhill said Paul on the US economy. “I don't believe in a double dip, I believe we have single-dip and it has been continuous.” “The only reason it doesn't look so bad is if you spend $2 trillion dollars and you have a $5 hundred billion increase in some GDP figures, you didn't get much for your trillion dollars but it might improve your statistics, so it was a fake recovery.” As for another presidency run, Paul says it is too early to tell. --By Daniela Cambone of Kitco News dcambone@kitco.com Watch Highlights From the Exclusive Ron Paul Interview with Kitco News <<Back to more Kitco exclusive news
"If there was no question, you'd think they would be very anxious to prove to us that the gold is there," said U.S. Rep. Ron Paul
“It began in January as part of a health kick. I run to the train station from my home in Alton, Hampshire. I get the train to Waterloo and then run from there to Tottenham Court Road,” explains Mike Fleming, 31.
In less than a year Fleming estimates they have saved around £1,500 doing the equivalent of a 10k run each day. “I no longer pay for car parking at Alton, nor do I have any Tube costs – and I get into work in a better frame of mind.”
Fleming is one of a growing band of run-commuters – workers who don their trainers to pound the pavements while their colleagues sit in traffic or are crammed into trains and buses.
A new study by the Royal Holloway University of London - funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) - shows that the number of people choosing to run to or from work as an alternative mode of transport has tripled in the last two years.
The reasons for run-commuting are varied. Simon Cook, who carried out the research, interviewed some of the respondents during their daily dash. “Since many of them had time pressures it made sense for me to join them and run alongside,” they say. “Their motivation for doing it ranged from ‘marathon training' to ‘being fed up with public transport' and a desire to ‘improve their work-life balance.'”
For Damian Hall, 38, from Bath, a seven-mile run to the office each morning has enabled them to create more family time. “In my spare time I do ultramarathons. They require the kind of training that can take up the bulk of my weekend, but I've got two small children and I want to spend my time with them, so I make my commute part of my training. I find that I arrive at the office more energised when I run and I can work off any frustrations on the run home.”
The Royal Holloway study found that 50pc of run-commuters ran both to and from work and that around 60pc of them have been doing so for less than two years.
“On average, they run 60 minutes a day,” says Cook. “Some will travel 40 miles or more for their commute - opting to run part of that distance. There does seem to be a minimum which most would not run, though - distances of just a couple of miles were deemed not worth the aggravation of changing and showering for.”
Among run commuters, 97pc say that more workplace showers and lockers are needed to encourage people to the initiative. Four out of five run-commuters will take a backpack containing their work wardrobe. Desk drawers become stores for the deodorant, soap, combs and towels and while some take advantage of nearby gym facilities for showering, one German run-commuter reported on a forum how they keep a wash bowl at work that he'll fill with water in the toilet, stand in and used to sponge bath himself.
Supporters of the initiative say such examples emphasise the need for employers to provide better facilities and for policymakers to wake up to a rapidly growing trend.
“There's a definite increase in the numbers of workers choosing to run-commute,” explains Gordon Lott, who leads the run2work campaign. “This study is a clear message to employers and the Government – they can do much more than is currently being done to enable people to be active and healthy.”
Lott believes that promoting all "active commuting" by prioritising facilities and providing tax breaks for equipment on a par with urban cycling initiatives could have a major impact on the health of the nation.
“There could be 50,000 run-commuters - there could be a quarter of a million. We don't know exactly because the census doesn't ask if people run to work, only if they walk or cycle.”
Last week, the Department of Transport published a 55-page report into the benefits of companies investing in cycling and walk-to work schemes, with no mention of running.
In the meantime Lott and fellow run-commuters look to enlist the support of busineses in creating a culture in which running to work is acceptable and normal. “Barclays, Morrisons, Vodafone and GE are among those providing facilities for runners – they're aware of the many benefits in having a fitter workforce that's not so reliant on public transport,” says Lott.
For London-based run-commuter Gareth Lewis, 40, engaging property developers and landlords is also a necessity for accommodating the rising numbers of run-commuters. “As someone who works in the property industry I see that it's starting to wake up to the changing demands of city workers such as run-commuters,” they say.
London's new Zig-Zag office building in Victoria, for example, aims to attract tenants with basement changing facilities that include 196 lockers and 16 showers (separate male and female). “I hope to see more focus on the role that providers of the built environment can play in making cities work and improving health, and providing the right infrastructure for initiatives like run-to-work.”
Creature Comforts brewery believes in giving back to the community and one way they do that is through their Get Comfortable campaign. The program generated over $65,000 in value last year and this year's goal is set at an impressive $100,000. Through various fundraising efforts, partnerships with other for-profit businesses, and support from the community they believe that goal is definitely attainable.
As part of the campaign, Get Comfortable IPA will be available in January at the brewery on draft and in cans and on draft in Atlanta and Athens at accounts that support the Get Comfortable program. Creature Comforts will donate 100% of the profits from to-go tours to the program and Savannah Distributing has also agreed to donate 100% of gross profits for the beer.

English Championship – facts and figures
EFL Championship (referred to as the Sky Bet Championship for sponsorship reasons) is the second tier of league competition in English football. Last season was the first of the EFL Championship under the current Sky Bet's name, and the twenty-fifth season under its current league structure. It is known as the wealthiest non top flight football league in the world and the seventh richest division in Europe.
It can boast with the second average match attendance among the second division European leagues, leaving the place only to Bundesliga 2. We are still waiting for the beginning of the new season, therefore it is a good moment for summing up the last one, predicting the outcomes for the next one, showing a bit of the league's history and analyse the statistics.
The history of the league
Basically the league exist from 1892, functioning as Division Two. In 1992, it was the subject of change into Division One. From 2004, it is the EFL (or now Sky Bet) Championship. The winners of the Championship receive the Football League Championship trophy, the same trophy as the old First Division champions were handed prior to the Premier League's inception in 1992. Ipswich Town are the leagues veterans, having the longest tenure in the Championship, last being out of the division in the 2001–02 season, when they were relegated from the Premier League.
Among the teams with the biggest amount of titles, we have Manchester City and Leicester City, who both won the league 7 times in their history. Behind the Citizens and the Foxes, come the Blues from Birmingham as well as Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday, which all earned 5 titles. Sunderland will have a chance to improve this record, being relegated from the Premier League last season.
Sky Bet's last season
Season 2016/17 saw a fierce rivalry until the last round between Newcastle United (relegated a season before from Premier League) and last season's revelation – Brighton & Hove Albion. Finally, the title went to Newcastle, as the Magpies ended the season with 94 points, only a point ahead of Brighton. Brighton actually lost their Champioship in the last round, having only drawn with Aston Villa (1-1), while Newcastle firmly beaten Barnsley 3 to 0. It was for sure an unimaginable loss for Brighton, as they were on the run throughout the whole season. On the other side, Rafael Benitez, the manager of Newcastle proved that they didn't give empty promises, when announcing their immediate return to Premier League plans.
Traditionally, there was a big fight for the play-off places (from 3 to 6). The regular season ended with Reading (led by great Dutch former player – Jaap Stam) earning the 3rd place, 4 points before the fourth Sheffield Wednesday and 5th Huddersfield Town. The last team, which qualified for the play-offs was Fulham, having big ambitions, adverting to their rich Premier League's history. All in all, it was Huddersfield Town, who earn the promotion, dramatically winning against Reading in the promotion final.
On the other side of the England Championship table we can find 3 relegated teams, finishing the season respectively on places from 22nd to 24th. These were Blackburn Rovers, which did not manage to come back to Premier League after their relegation in 2012. Also Wigan Athletic and Rotterham did not manage to maintain in the league for the next season.
Chris Wood, a New-Zealander from Leeds United scored the biggest amount of goals -25. Newcastle United managed to earn the biggest away victory (0:6 against QPR), as well as to maintain the longest winning streak – 8 matches. The runners-up from Brighton had the longest unbeaten run, which last for 18 games. Rotterham United noted the longest winless run, lasting for 17 matches.
A close look on the Champions
The current champions from Newcastle managed to build a strong team upon the players who stayed after the relegation. Ayoze Perez, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Jack Colback or Chancel Mbemba were among the most significant names, who shown their loyalty and considerably helped the team in their way back to Premier League. Apart from them, the team managed to sign Matt Ritchie or Dwight Gayle, who turned out to be a bull's eye (both scoring many goals and having lots of assists) as well as Christian Atsu or Mohamed Diame.
That is why nobody cried after Papiss Cisse or Fabrizio Coloccini. The team managed to score 85 goals, conceding only 40 and having the goal difference of 45 goals (the best in the league). Their striker, Dwight Gayle had a decent impact on their attacking form, as they scored 26 goals. Also Matty Ritchie contributed highly to the final success, scoring 17 goals, as well as the other striker – Ayoze Perez, who ended the season with 15 strikes. Due to all of these, Newcastle United managed to bring Premier League back on St. James Park.
Incoming season's prediction
It is no surprise that the teams relegated last year from Premier League will be among the candidates for the title this season. That is why Hull City, Middlesbrough and Sunderland have a big chance for the win. If only they would maintain the cores of their squads, it is highly probable to see them on top. Other teams, which may go off for the fight are Reading and Sheff Wed, which were really near the promotion last season, as well as Watford, Fulham or the sleeping giants from Aston Villa.
On the other hand, Nottingham Forest has very fortunately managed to maintain their Championship's tenure for the next season, ending last one with the same amount of points as relegated Blackburn, having only a better goal difference balance (2 goals more). Unless they improve their form, this season might be also very difficult from them. Also the newly promoted Bolton, Sheffield United and Milwall will struggle for their maintenance in the tier.
Transfers
Although there are many weeks of transfer window ahead, we have already seen many interesting moves. Hull City, relegated last year, have lost Harry Maguire or Tom Huddlestone, who respectively moved to Leicester City or Derby County. They were also involved in an interesting exchange with Liverpool – Andrew Robertson moved to Liverpool, while Kevin Stewart has strengthened Hull's squad.
Middlesbrough lost two or three important players, like the left winger Victor Fischer, who went to Mainz, Jordan Rhodes, who went to Sheff Wed or the goalkeeper, however they managed to find equally good replacements. Darren Randolph from West Ham for the goalkeeper position, Britt Assombalonga for 17,10 Mill. € for the attack and Martin Braithwaite from Toulouse for the wings. Sunderland looks as for now as the weakest from the relegated teams, having sold two solid goalkeepers – Vito Mannone to Reading and the amazing youngster goalie – Jordan Pickford for an astonishing amount of 28,50 Mill. € to Everton.
They managed to sign however Irish international – Aiden McGeady (also from Everton) and a goalkeeper Jason Steele from Blackburn.
Among other interesting moves, we have Urby Emanuelson from Sheff Wed to FC Utrecht, Tomas Kalas loaned from Chelsea to Fulham, Mateusz Klich from FC Twente to Leeds, Vurnon Anita from Newcastle also to Leeds.
Derby County bought Andre Wisdom and Tom Huddlestone (respectively from Liverpool and Hull City), however they sold their two big talents – Tom Ince (to Huddersfield Town) and Will Hughes (Watford). Brentford FC bought a very interesting player, known from Eredivisie pitches - Kamohelo Mokotjo from FC Twente.
And the best for the final – John Terry has signed a contract with Aston Villa. The legendary Chelsea captain got convinced by Villans president to sign a 2-year deal with them. They also bought a solid, experienced defender – Cherno Samba.
Bunch of team statistics
If you are one of those, who like to have the access to all the data, analyses, comparisons, then this section shall particularly appeal to you. It will let you conduct a better, more thorough analysis of the current situation, the form of each team, predictions for the following fixtures, as well as follow the latest news about each team or player.
English Championship table
Among all data, the most important, is always the league table. Last season ended with a slight Newcastle's win, gathering only one point more than Brighton. They won 29 matches, which was the highest number among all teams. Similarly to Brighton, the conceded 40 goals, however with 84 goals scored, they managed to have the highest goal difference. Fulham and Norwich (respectively 6th and 8th in the English Championship table) scored the highest amount of goals- 85. While on the other hand, Rotterham lost 98 goals, significantly lagging behind the rest of the league. Rotterham has also collected the lowest number of points – 23, having won only 5 matches, drawing 8 and losing 33.
Other relevant statistics
As it was already said, Fulham and Norwich distinguish themselves with the highest number of scored goals – 85. On the other hand, Norwich and Newcastle has the highest average of goals per game – 1.85. Rotterham has its place on the other end of this ranking – having the highest average of conceded goals per match - 2.13. Newcastle and Fulham have also a distinguishable average of shots per game – 13.30. Newcastle has the highest number of shots on goal -5.28 per match, while Fulham is a bit worse, having 4.93. Norwich and Brentford have also a significant average of shots on goal per game, respectively 5.26 and 5.24 threating the opposite goalie.
Fulham and Huddersfield and Reading, so three from the play-off places, can be proud of their ball possession throughout the season, leaving behind the rest of the teams. Fulham has an incredible ball possession stats, reaching almost 60% (59.96%). Under the current coach they love to play an attractive, dominating style of football. The second Hudderfsfield town reached 58.04%, while the third Reading 57.13%. The champion from Newcastle, is fourth in this ranking, reaching 52.65%. On the other side, we have i.e. Rotterham or Cardiff, which undoubtedly loved to play counterattacks, having an average ball possession at the level of 39.76% and 41.50% of time respectively.
QPR was the most aggressively playing team, committing a total number of 618.0 fouls during the season, which gives an average of 13.43 fouls per game. On the other side, we have gentlemen from Fulham, who can be distinguished by a very clean style of play, committing 429.0 fouls throughout the season (9.33 per game). We have also the ranking of the team with the highest numbers of cards – Nottingham Forest earned the biggest of them, over 2 yellow cards per game (2.20) and one red card each 5 games (0.20).
Individual statistics
English Championship top scorers
First place in this ranking is deservedly earned by Chris Wood from Leeds, who scored 27 goals. It is almost a half of the team goals in general (61). They scored 0.7 goals per match on average. Then we three players with the same amount of 23 goals. Glenn Murray from Brighton, who considerably helped their team earn the promotion with their 23 goals, giving them an average of 0.5 goals per game. Next one is Tammy Abraham – Swansea's youngster, loaned to Bristol City with an average of 0.6 goals per game and Dwight Gayle from Newcastle, having also an average of 0.5 goals per match. The experienced 35 years old Frenchman, Yann Kermorgant from Reading, scored 19 goals, which gave them the 5th position in this ranking.
Top assistants
Here we have one player, who significantly left behind all other ones. Conor Hurrihane from Aston Villa ended the season with 14 goals, which gave them the 1st position in the top assistans ranking. Then we have 4 players, who have the same number of last passes – 10. These are Tom Cairney, Sone Aluko (both from Fulham) Wes Hoolahan (Norwich) and Albert Adonah (Aston Villa). As you can see, 24 goals of the 47 Villans' goals come from the great play of this important duo.
Most brutal players
David Davis (Birmingham) and Lewis Dunk (Brighton) are among the most brutally playing ones, collecting respectively 15 and 14 yellow cards and one red. Just right after them, we have Pontus Jansson (from Leeds) and Preston's Ben Pearson, with 14 yellow cards, but no red ones. Kevin McDonald from Fulham has also earned 14 cards - 13 yellows and one red.
English Championship Summary
To sum up, English Championship is one of the most exciting and exhausting leagues. Featuring 24 teams, it gives a total amount of 46 matches in regular season phase. As for the fans, it is undoubtedly a good fact, giving them a lot of possibilities to watch high-quality football. Next season will be very exciting, with a lot of teams interested in promotion. The league starts at the 4th of August with the match Sunderland – Derby. Don't forget to follow the matches of your favourite teams and players.
BJP's magnanimous victory in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand has energised the party's state units across India. The party leaders not only expect to comfortably retain Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, which are slated to go for polls within a year, but also pinned hopes on Maharashtra where the BJP government relies heavily on the Shiv Sena.
To cash in on the current Modi wave and also the thumping victory of recent civic elections, the BJP might go for early Assembly elections, say top BJP leaders. The government still has two and half years to complete the term. However, the ride so far has been like a rollercoaster.
“We have had enough of arm twisting by Shiv Sena. We won't tolerate their threats anymore. Post civic elections results, the Shiv Sena is not in a position to threaten us anymore and even if they do, we would prefer to go for polls,” said a senior BJP leader.
The party hopes to win the state with a thumping margin if elections are held today. “Even if the Assembly polls are held within a year, we would be able to get majority on our own. However, we would like to complete the term if the Sena allows us to do so,” say party leaders.
The party is expecting Modi wave to continue at least till 2019.
In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, BJP has 122 members, which is 23 less than the simple majority. Shiv Sena has 63 members. Before 2014, Shiv Sena has had an upper hand, playing the role of “big brother”. However, things have changes a lot since then.
BJP has expanded further in Maharashtra in the last two and half years, making inroads in the state. This is obvious from results of the recent municipal corporations and Zilla Parishad elections in the state. BJP occupied 8 out of 10 corporations and one-third of the Zilla parishads.
Most BJP leaders feel that the party should get rid of the Shiv Sena as early as possible. “They neither work nor let us work. On top of that, they don't leave any opportunity to attack us. This is quite embarrassing and discomfitting at times,” feel some BJP leaders.
Party spokesperson Madhav Bhandari, however, downplayed such speculations. “I don't think that UP and Uttarakhand results will impact Maharashtra's politics anytime soon," they said.

User Guide
I wrote Flatpack for all sorts of gamers, and kids from 10 to 110 will get a kick out of adventuring and rebuilding. Players are encouraged to solve problems creatively, work together and with their community, and seek out non-violent solutions to their problems. I wrote this game thinking about my two daughters, and the kinds of stories I want to tell them. I wrote this game because I think there's room for all sorts of problem-solving around a table with dice. I wrote this game because I've never met a grim, dark setting I didn't want to ‘fix.' If you're anything like me, or want to see what I mean, take a closer look at Flatpack.
If you like Fallout, Act Raiser, Sim City, Civilization, Ikea and fixing things that are broken; this might just be the tabletop roleplaying game for you!
Construction Instructions
Character Creation: The sheet couldn't be more simple. You've got six traits that reflect how you approach the obstacles in your life. Two of those are traits you're great at, two or those are not much to worry about, and two you're pretty lousy at. Get an idea of who you and your friends were before the game started by playing a round of Two Truths and a Lie, and you're ready to start playing.
Rules and Systems: You're using either four sided die, a six sided die or an eight sided die. If you roll a seven or better, usually you win. If you have built some Flatpack Instant Buildings is the society building mini map game, you can sometimes add a six sided die to the roll. That's the bare bones of the system. From there, it's all about hacking the system! Messing with the rules is encouraged and reflected in character advancement, and it's a way of adding sophistication to game play without excluding younger players who might enjoy something more simple.
The Troublemaker never has to pick up a die. With a hand full of Conflict Cards, a puzzle or two, and a little inspiration, they have everything they need to run an adventure. There's only need for as much set up as you want and it can be run just fine by the seat of your pants. In fact, it may blow those pants right off when you see how simple the game really is to run.
The book covers how to pace your story, how to run the mini map game, and how to use puzzles, mind teasers, and simple games in your Flatpack adventures.
Character Advancement: Instead of counting coins and experience points, Flatpack uses an Achievement reward system. When your players do something really very awesome with their characters in game, they unlock an achievement, just like in a video game! These Achievements change the character by tweaking and hacking the rules in their favor. For example, a character who excels at exploring the labyrinthine underground mall-complexes left from Before might earn the Mall-Walker Achievement. From then on, the Troublemaker can never raise their difficulty higher than seven. Each character, over time, becomes their own collection of hacked rules and what they can do is a reflection of what they've done in the game. Likewise, each Flatpack comes with its own rules tweaks that change the way the map game is played for the player. The buildings also reflect on the character sheet by unlocking special Achievements as your city grows. The things that are awesome make the characters more awesome, because we think that is, well, awesome!

Where's the Money Going
The thing about Crowdsourcing is that you get to see more what we're doing with your money when you get involved. At Machine Age Productions, we believe in transparency. The raw materials and printing costs of a run of the game, including lunchboxes and paying artists and editor, will run us about $500. The other $500 covers the time I spent working on this project and the time I intend to spend working on the Book of Puzzles as well as the other items put up on this Kickstarter. That's not a lot of money, really, when you look at the time investment, since I wrote this entirely myself. Any money we make above and beyond the goal will help cushion our company and allow us to keep making the sorts of games that you may like. We have a lot of ideas, a lot of games in progress, but you can't make games on an entirely empty stomach, and every penny you kick our way is the fuel we spend on making new games for you! (Well, and it feeds into our Kickstarting habits. Buy my game so I can buy other people's. It's the circle of life, I think.)
Thank you so much for your attention as well as any support you can give us. Hear more from me in the coming weeks on various podcasts, blogs, as well as twitter and G+. Hit me up with questions and get excited. We love this game. We hope you do to.
Claim: Photograph shows an F/A-18 Hornet flying past a Detroit apartment building.
TRUE
Example: [Collected via e-mail, July 2009]
I work in downtown Detroit and the last few years during the Gold Cup boat races there is a F/A 18 Hornet low flying demonstration. Before the time trials last Friday (July 10th around noon) this was the case once again. A single F/A 18 buzzing all the skyscrapers in downtown, car alarms going off in all the parking garages and office personnel watching this awesome display from one of our country's finest. One I was talking to other and reading the web, I found an awesome looking photo (attached). As low as I know this plane was, this photo is very possible. Many websites is calling this photo fake. I did not have this same vantage point as the photographer but I just want to know is this photo real?

Origins: The startling picture displayed above was taken by Detroit News
photographer Steve Perez on 12 July 2009. On that date, a Navy F/A-18 Hornet from Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia made a scheduled flyover above Detroit to entertain crowds gathered along the Detroit River to watch the American Power Boat Association Gold Cup powerboat races. Just as the jet turned sideways and zoomed past a high-rise apartment complex, Perez snapped the remarkable photo shown here.
Although the photographer's vantage point and the flattening effect of a two-dimensional telephoto lens make the jet appear to be very close to the apartment building, according to the military “the jet was actually about 200 to 300 feet away from the shoreline” and “no one on the ground or in a building was ever at any risk.”

I was in Pensacola.
You know where you were.
Every MSU fan remembers where they were for the 2007 Wisconsin game — MSU's first and only win over a No. 1 team in the regular season and just second ever. The opportunities don't come around that often, and victories are even rarer. MSU is 3-18 all-time against No. 1, the others being Indiana State in the 1979 National Championship and Louisville in the 2009 Elite Eight.
But there's so much more on the line Tuesday. At 11-2, MSU and No. 1 Indiana are atop the Big Ten standings, at least two games above the rest of the conference. A win Tuesday won't crown the conference champion, but it puts the winner one step closer with four games to go.
There's also the streak. The 17-game home winning streak against Indiana that dates back to 1991. Of all the long winning streaks against a specific team at Breslin, this one is the oddest. There have been some good Indiana teams and bad MSU teams in that stretch.
It's the biggest game in Breslin history — Whiteout 2 — and it comes one week after perhaps the loudest crowd in EL watched the Spartans pound No. 4 Michigan. MSU is up to No. 4 in the AP Poll and No. 5 in the coaches poll, making this the first-ever matchup of top five teams in East Lansing. And Hoosiers, if not for MSU, you wouldn't have the most recent undefeated season in college basketball.
Indiana brings in the No. 1 adjO in the country, and the Hoosiers do just about everything well on that side of the ball. They shoot 42.7 percent on 3s (No. 2) and 53.9 percent on 2s (No. 12) and hold onto the ball (19.2 percent, No. 117). They're No. 2 in the nation at getting to the free-throw line, averaging nearly one free throw per two shot attempts (insert comment about the Hall of Calls). When they're at the line, they make 74.6 percent of their free throws, which is No. 27. In conference play, they remain the top shooting team.
In the first meeting — a 75-70 Indiana win — the Hoosiers shot 50.9 percent, which is the second-highest an opponent has shot against MSU this year. Victor Oladipo led the way with 21 points on 8-for-12 shooting. The biggest problem for MSU in the game was that IU shot 59 percent on 2s, compared to 38 percent on 3s. This with Cody Zeller going 2-for-7 from the field. The problem was guards driving to the hoop, as well as some first-half turnovers that led to easy breakaway buckets. The box score gives IU a 14-8 advantage in fast-break points in that game, and MSU had 19 turnovers.
As a team, eight players average at least 10 minutes per game, and five average at least 10 points per game. There is no shortage of options. Oladipo (13.8 points, 5.8 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 2.2 steals, 127.8 ORtg) might be the Big Ten POW frontrunner, and for good reason. He's an elite player on both sides of the ball. He's added the jump shot to their arsenal (52 percent on 3s), too. However, they sprained their left ankle against Purdue on Saturday and didn't return, though they didn't need to.  They are expected to play, but their effectiveness is yet to be seen. If he's hampered at all, it would obviously be beneficial for MSU. He'll likely be guarded by Branden Dawson, who did a terrific defensive job against Tim Hardaway Jr. last week, but Oladipo is much better off the dribble.
Zeller (16.6 points, 8.2 rebounds) is actually No. 2 in the KP POY rating. As mentioned above, though, they struggled against MSU in the last meeting. Derrick Nix outmuscled them quite a bit, though Zeller did go 5-for-6 from the free-throw line. For their part, Nix went 4-for-8 and had four offensive rebounds. Given Nix is playing the best ball of their life in the past few weeks, this will be a very important matchup. MSU has been running the offense through Nix recently, but Indiana played a lot of zones in the previous meeting. If they go man, expect Nix to get a lot of touches.
Elsewhere, Christian Watford (13.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, 49 percent from 3) is a threat both inside and out, and Adriean Payne will have their hands full. Watford went 5-for-9 from the floor in the first meeting, while Payne scored 18 on 7-for-10 shooting, including 3-for-4 from 3. Jordan Hulls (10.7 points, 48 percent from 3) can be lethal beyond the arc, and Will Sheehey (10.2 points, 51 percent shooting) is not short on confidence off the bench.
Defensively, Indiana is much better than they're given credit for. No. 12 in adjD (one spot higher than MSU) and opponent shoot 30.9 percent from 3 (No. 53) and 41.8 percent on 2s (No. 17). Those numbers go up a little bit in conference play, but are still top-four in the conference. The Hoosiers get to the free-throw line well and also prevent opponents from getting there (No. 14, No. 4 in conference play) with opponents taking about one free throw per four shot attempts. Since going 5-for-6 from the line at Indiana, MSU has averaged 24.8 free throw attempts per game.
Fouls were a big issue for MSU in the first meeting, and with Travis Trice likely out, it remains a point of focus. Keith Appling played just 19 minutes in the first meeting while dealing with foul trouble, and Trice played 30 minutes (although their numbers were less than pleasant). Denzel Valentine is the only player off the bench who can play heavy minutes, although Alex Gauna and Matt Costello have been serviceable in recent games. MSU goes as far as the starters take them, and KJ pointed out the balance on Monday.
But MSU's biggest playmaker in the first matchup was Gary Harris. While "Gary Sucks" chants rained down from the Assembly Hall crowd, Harris scored 21 points on 6-for-13 shooting, including 5-for-10 from three-point range. He's shooting 53 percent from behind the arc in conference play. Their driving ability has been hampered by back and shoulder injuries, but he's been a sharpshooter from 3, and MSU needs it in this one.
The glass will also be an important battle. Indiana grabs 39.9 percent of its misses on the season, while MSU allows opponents to get just 27.7 percent. In the first meeting, the Hoosiers grabbed 33 percent. MSU's OR% on the season is 34.8, while Indiana's defense allows 29.6 percent. In the first meeting, the Spartans grabbed 36 percent. As for turnovers, MSU had things figured out before a rough first half at Nebraska. Indiana forces turnovers 22 percent of the time. Giving away some breakaway layups again is not advised.
KenPom predicts a 71-69 Indiana win, giving MSU a 40 percent chance of winning.
It's a matchup of two different basketball cultures. In Bloomington, they say, "In 49 states, it's just basketball, but this is Indiana." In East Lansing, they say, "Players Play - Tough Players Win." The Big Ten's historic power against the Big Ten's new age power.
It's all set up. A top-five matchup, a national TV audience, Dickie V, first place on the line, Magic Johnson as an additional guest analyst, the No. 1 team coming in with multiple NBA draft picks.
Nix and some MSU fans want more respect? Molon Labe.

HD49933 was one of the stars observed using the Corot telescope Scientists have recorded the sound of three stars similar to our Sun using France's Corot space telescope. A team writing in Science journal says the sounds have enabled them to get information about processes deep within stars for the first time. If you listen closely to the sounds of each star - by clicking on the media in this page - you'll hear a regular repeating pattern. These indicate that the entire star is pulsating. You'll also note that the sound of one star is very slightly different to the other. That's because the sound they make depends on their age, size and chemical composition. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The technique, called "stellar seismology", is becoming increasingly popular among astronomers because the sounds give an indication of what is going on in the stars' interior. Just as seismic waves moving through Earth provide information about our planet's insides, so sound waves travelling through a star carry information about its inner workings. The Corot spacecraft detects the oscillations as subtle variations in the light emitted by the star as the surface wobbles. This light signal can then be converted back to sounds we understand. According to Professor Eric Michel, of the Paris Observatory, the technique is already giving researchers remarkable new insights. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. They commented: "This is a completely new way to look at the stars compared with what has been available for the past 50 years. It is very exciting." Professor Michel has found that the star pulsations are close to what was predicted for stars of this kind. But there is a slight variation from what was expected. The variation suggests that astronomers might need to refine their theories of stellar evolution. Professor Ian Roxburgh of Queen Mary College London is among those trying to work out what the sounds from the stars tell us about processes occurring inside stars. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "It's not easy," they say. "It's like listening to the sound of a musical instrument and then trying to reconstruct the shape of the instrument". Astronomers are increasingly listening into stars and other space sounds, according to Dr Tim O'Brien, of Manchester University's Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. "It's interesting in itself," they said. "It's also scientifically useful." Dr O'Brien has collected their favourite space sounds in the Jodrell Bank podcast, known as the Jodcast. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. "All you are really doing when you're collecting stuff from space is that you've got to get that information into your brain so you can think about it," they explained in their podcast. "And what we're used to doing is putting visual information into our brain - well there's no real reason why we shouldn't listen to signals."

Maybe, despite an autumn of knee-jerk outrage, that Indiana never existed.
Tom Crean yells to their players during Indiana's win over Maryland on Thursday. (USAT)
The Indiana team that scorched the Assembly Hall nets Thursday night and torched No. 13 Maryland 89-70 – that didn't much resemble the disaster that was allegedly unfolding in early November. The team that dropped a dazzling 15 3-pointers on the Terrapins – that couldn't be the same group some gave up on before it had played a single game this season. The guys who dropped the most points on Maryland in its last 48 games – those couldn't be the problem children who reportedly lacked leadership and cohesion after a string of off-court problems. The coach who has devised a shockingly effective small-ball lineup in the absence of injured frontcourt players Hanner Mosquera-Perea and Devin Davis – that couldn't be the guy some IU backers wanted tossed out with the Halloween pumpkins in early November. The fans who were pining away for Brad Stevens or anybody not named Tom Crean – those weren't the howling Hoosiers fans who helped make Maryland melt down amid an atmosphere Terrapins coach Mark Turgeon called "the best we've played in all year."
Now that we've plowed through the preseason panic and actually played 19 games, this is Indiana: 15-4 and ranked in the AP Top 25.
Now that we've completed one-third of the Big Ten season, this is Indiana: 5-1 and tied for first.
Now that we're 36 days from March, this is your front-runner for Big Ten Coach of the Year: Tom Crean.
Story continues
"We're improving," Crean said. "They've been improving all year. They've gotten closer. They've really worked hard to control what they can control."
What the Hoosiers couldn't control was the legion of doom that mobilized after a Halloween night accident in which Emmitt Holt hit Davis with their car, resulting in a major head injury to Davis. (Holt was not found to be at fault in the accident.) That was the last in a series of missteps by IU players dating back through the summer and last spring. When combined with the generally bleak outlook for the season (the Hoosiers were picked to finish 10th in a Big Ten Network poll of media members) and the bleak result of last season (17-15 and no postseason, not even the NIT), the negative vibes were palpable.
But the Hoosiers blocked them out.
"We just stayed together through everything," said Troy Williams, who turned in their fourth-straight stellar performance with 16 points and seven rebounds. "We just know that at the end of the day it's still us [who are] the only ones in the gym … it's still us that's still together as a team. So we didn't let none of the outside get to us. We just stayed together and you see the results are coming out well for us."
Still, even the most optimistic player had to have doubts when starting big man Mosquera-Perea went down with a knee injury a couple of weeks ago. This was a small team with threadbare interior depth to begin with, and losing the 6-foot-9 junior looked like a potential disaster.

Instead, Crean got creatively small. They moved 6-foot-6 Colin Hartman to center and put them in the starting lineup. The sophomore from Indianapolis didn't start a game as a first-year student and rarely played – and then they blew out a knee last March in a workout after Indiana's season was over.
They made their first collegiate start Jan. 13 against Penn State, tying their career high with eight points. Thursday against Maryland, they shocked the Terrapins with 15 and hit all three of their 3-point shots.
Suddenly, a guy who nobody was sure would be able to play at all this year has become the key to a five-out lineup of shooters and drivers that is burning up the Big Ten.
"The more we play Colin away from the post, the better it is," Crean said. "Because they can drive the ball for us. … We offered them a scholarship because of their ability to play the game."
Indiana is a fairly insane 36 of 70 from 3-point range since Hartman moved into the starting lineup – and it's coming from all angles. Robert Johnson hit four against Penn State. James Blackmon Jr. hit four against Illinois. Yogi Ferrell hit a whopping seven against Maryland.
Despite that diversity, collective shooting like that cannot be counted on to continue in perpetuity. There will be nights when the bombs don't drop, and then a small team with myriad defensive weaknesses will face a serious challenge. This is still the same squad that was crushed by Michigan State, gave up 94 to crooked-shooting Louisville and 88 to Eastern Washington.
But this is not the barbed-wire defensive Big Ten of recent years. Advanced stats guru Ken Pomeroy rates only one Big Ten team (Nebraska) among the national top 35 in defensive efficiency, down from five in the top 35 each of the previous two seasons.
If teams in this league are more susceptible defensively, Indiana is well-equipped to exploit those weaknesses. Outside of Wisconsin, no one in the conference appears significantly better than the Hoosiers. And an NCAA tournament bid that few forecasts has become a realistic goal.
"There's a ton of room for improvement," Crean said. "It's one really good win against a really good team."
Crean is right – walloping Maryland is not a sign that Indiana has arrived. But it is a sign that a season believed to be on the brink has a chance to be a season to remember.
Sheer Perfection [Signs of Sorcery] [Mage: The Awakening]
Mage: The Awakening, Open Development
Welcome back, faithful readers!
Mage‘s errata is being incorporated, and the second edition core will soon be off to have an Index added. In the meantime, now that we have a stable ruleset, I think it's high time to get back to Signs of Sorcery.
Our topic tonight is the Perfected Metals, one of the lesser-known pieces of Awakening lore. They showed up in a spell (“Forge Thaumium”) in the 1st ed core, and of course in the names of some of the Watchtowers, but it wasn't until Legacies: The Ancient that they were explained. Essentially, the seven classical metals of gold, mercury, silver, tin, copper, lead, and iron had Perfected, magical forms . Gold, for example, became orichalcum, which when alloyed with lunargent (silver) and hermium (mercury) in a spell became Thaumium. Legacies: The Ancient gave a few lines of notes about what those metals did when not alloyed together, and launched a dozen fan theories and rules expansions in the process.
When Signs of Sorcery was but a glint in a Developer's eye, I knew I wanted to finally take a look at the Perfected metals. I knew it with such certainty that we cut Forge Thaumium from second edition's corebook in order to revisit it properly in Signs.
I asked my writers to give rules for all seven metals (only four had them in Legacies: The Ancient) and to give more alloys than just Thaumium. They spun off from there, taking in things like Perfected fire, Perfected water, Perfected flesh. It's a shortish section full of plot hooks right at the start of Signs' chapter on Crafting, and it's available for your reading pleasure here.
As always, this has not been to an editor. Pointing out spelling mistakes is just denying the editor the satisfaction of their job.
I am particularly interested in whether or not the spells involved should keep the ability to make them Lasting.
Those of you trying to convert the Crasftmasons. Yeah, they probably have Honed the Perfected Form as an Attainment.
(NB: Yes, Apeiron here is different to the substance described in Imperial Mysteries, which used its name to refer to the ultimate expression of Matter magic. If we ever revisit archmasters' mechanics, that'll be getting a name change, in the same spirit that Platonic Forms and Eidolons are no longer called Tulpa because that's what Mad Ones' Arcana manifestations are called, and goetic entities are called Goetia to distinguish them from Pandemonium's natives. Mage has a vast lexicon, and every now and again we come across two things sharing a name like this.)
Starting another round of battle to make its presence felt, Tata Group backed low-cost carrier AirAsia on Sunday announced to offer 3 million promotional seats across AirAsia's network with fares for domestic routes starting from Rs 699 (all inclusive) while for international routes the tickets can be booked starting Rs2,599 (all inclusive). The offer on domestic network is available for travelling from Bengaluru to Chennai/ Kochi/ Goa/ Jaipur/ Chandigarh and vice versa. The officials said the offer is available on international flights from Chennai/ Kochi/ Kolkata/ Tiruchirappalli/ Bengaluru/Hyderabad to Kuala Lumpur operated by AirAsia Berhad and Chennai to Bangkok operated by Thai AirAsia.
The airline officials said the offer whose booking started from 9:30 pm on Sunday will last till November 16 for the travel period? from June 10, 2015 – January 17, 2016. Commenting on the sale, AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya said, "Big Sale will allow our guests to plan travel early with extremely low fares."
In conjunction to the Big Sale promotion, free seats are also up for grabs for AirAsia Berhad flights from Kuala Lumpur to destinations across the airline's extensive network, such as Langkawi, Yogyakarta, Krabi, Siem Reap, Kalibo, Da Nang, Surat Thani, Chengdu, Perth, the airlines official added.
According to industry insiders, the sale by Air Asia is expected to get a competing response from rival airlines. Since the time Air Asia, which is known for its dirt cheap fares announced its venture into the Indian market, there have been several rounds of air fare wars among the airlines in India which have benefited the passengers.
According to the latest data available with global airline body IATA, domestic passenger traffic rose 7.4% in August, which stands second highest growth rate globally after Russia's 10%. However, the low fare war has not gone down well with the apex association of air passengers as Sudhakar Reddy, president of Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) last week wrote to aviation regulator DGCA questioning the frequent 'special fare' offers by domestic carriers and termed them as 'non-existent'. The association urged the DGCA to take action against the malpractices of such airlines. Drawing the attention of DGCA, Reddy, said they have been forced to write to them as most of the time, schemes of low air fares are similar across competing airlines, indicating the possibility of working of a cartel among the airline companies to "fool the public".
“It's also what people hate about politics, and it's why, frankly, members of my family are not too interested in politics, period, or wanting me to do more of this,” they said. “To tell you the truth, people can think what they want, I can go back to being a doctor anytime, if they're tired of me. I'll go back to being a doctor, and I'll be perfectly content.”
On a day when one potential rival for the Republican nomination, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, was expected to win re-election overwhelmingly, Mr. Paul was fending off a new disclosure that came Monday night, this one served up by BuzzFeed. The site reported that an op-ed article Mr. Paul wrote for The Washington Times in September on mandatory minimum prison sentences appeared to have copied language from an essay that had been published in the magazine The Week.
That article, written by Dan Stewart, an editor for the magazine, included this sentence: “America now jails a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country, including China and Iran, at the staggering cost of $80 billion a year.” It was posted on the web on Sept. 14.
On Sept. 20, Mr. Paul wrote this: “America now jails a higher percentage of its citizens than any other country, including China and Iran, at the staggering cost of $80 billion a year.”
The Washington Times said Tuesday that it was canceling Mr. Paul's column by mutual agreement.
Mr. Paul made it clear that they took that example more seriously than the previous disclosures. The first of those came last week on the MSNBC show of Rachel Maddow. They highlighted a speech from last Monday that used parts of the Wikipedia description of the 1990s movie “Gattaca,” which was based on a science fiction future in which societal standing is determined through DNA testing.
On Tuesday, Mr. Paul argued that that did not technically represent plagiarism. “Trying to say someone commits plagiarism, you're saying that someone is dishonest,” they said. “And, well, it would be dishonest if I tried to say, ‘Oh, I had this great idea for a movie, and this is my idea, and this is a story I wrote in college called ‘Gattaca.' ”
Mr. Paul said that the unattributed passages of their Washington Times article were the result of life at the speed of a newly minted national political figure, and that the article had been adapted from a speech, which was one of the reasons it was not vetted.
Antifa protesters carrying sticks and wearing makeshift armor attacked a peaceful right-wing demonstration in Berkeley's Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park Sunday afternoon. This led to five injuries and 13 arrests, according to the Washington Post.
As with the violence surrounding Milo Yiannopoulos' Berkeley speech in February, the left-wing protesters were mostly peaceful. A minority of about 100 masked and black-clad antifa militants sparked the violence and were condemned by many members of the “Rally Against Hate” protest who left after the fighting started, as well as by Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín. “Fighting hate with hate does not work and only makes each side more entrenched in their ideological camps,” they said in a statement.
President Trump's condemnation of violence on “many sides” may have been inappropriate given that the only death at a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville was allegedly inflicted by alt-right demonstrators, but as Rare's Matt Purple has pointed out, the president was correct that both left and right have indulged in violence over the past year.
Antifa protestors clashed with police on Inauguration Day, a Charlottesville white nationalist is accused of slamming their vehicle into a crowd of counter-protesters, and the two groups traded blows in a Portland park earlier this month as Silly String, glitter, projectiles and pepper spray flew.
These kinds of clashes have become commonplace in Trump's America, and it's easy to see why.
RARE POV: We should absolutely shun neo-Nazis and Charlottesville white nationalist marchers
Critics of the president often claim they have emboldened white nationalist groups with their policies and rhetoric. Supporters answer that they have, in fact, condemned white nationalists on numerous occasions. That's true, but many racists still consider Trump their ally, and they have begun acting with a boldness and visibility not seen since the days of the Civil Rights movement.
In emboldening the darkest corners of the alt-right, however, Trump has also done the same for the alt-left. CNN reported, “Antifa leaders admit they're willing to physically attack anyone who employs violence against them or condones racism — as long as force is used in the name of eradicating hatred.”
The two groups have been feeding off one other in an increasingly vicious cycle. Antifa supporters have memed the living hell out of white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face and equated the movement's violent actions to those of the soldiers who stormed the beaches on D-Day to fight fascism. Clearly, they believe themselves to be facing an enemy that only violence can defeat.
The problem with that view is that the alt-right will feel the need to defend themselves, not just ideologically but physically. Perhaps they too will come to the conclusion that the time for words is over, and the only way to save this country is through violence.
RARE POV: Yes, left-wing violence matters, and Donald Trump was right to condemn the attacks on “many sides”
If you want to know whether a protest is truly peaceful, look at what they're wearing. Most of the left-wing protesters in Berkeley were in ordinary street clothes, but the antifa agitators wore all black, hid their faces underneath bandanas, protected themselves with shields and shin pads, and carried large sticks as weapons. In Charlottesville, many of the white nationalist protesters were openly carrying pistols and assault rifles. Some even wore body armor.
These people weren't dressing for protests. They were anticipating a fight, perhaps even a war.
An informal March survey by Thomas Ricks asked national security experts what the odds were that an American civil war would break out in the near future. The average fell at around 35 percent, but some answers were as high as 60 percent or even 95 percent. Since that survey, the situation has only become tenser.
I'm not saying another civil war is imminent or even likely, but when weapons are combined with belligerently opposed ideologies, all that's missing is a spark — a shot heard round the world.
How long will it be before open-carrying alt-righters fire on a black-clad antifa crowd armed with with clubs and rocks? So far, the injuries have been mostly minor and the death toll low, but the stage is set for a bloodbath. I pray for restraint on both sides.
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Questions were raised about PACE chief Agramunt's impartiality
A top European human rights official has resigned amid a corruption investigation and complaints about them having visited Syria with Russian MPs.
Pedro Agramunt resigned as president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). The council is Europe's main human rights watchdog.
PACE members - MPs from across Europe - had called for their dismissal.
PACE is probing claims that some of its members did favours for Azerbaijan in so-called "caviar diplomacy".
The oil-rich ex-Soviet state has cracked down on political dissidents.
There are suspicions that Azerbaijan influenced members of PACE, allegedly wooing them with gifts, and in 2013 the assembly rejected a report on Azeri political prisoners.
Independent investigators are to report on the PACE scandal by the end of this year.
Separately, Mr Agramunt - a Spaniard - was criticised for their visit to Syria with Russian MPs in March, when they met President Bashar al-Assad.
The Syrian leader has been condemned internationally for human rights abuses, including chemical attacks blamed on their forces.
In a statement the Socialist group at PACE said "even if the visit has been 'personal' and 'private', in no case the name of the Parliamentary Assembly can be involved in initiatives which can be objectively read as a support of Assad's regime and its action against the Syrian population".
Russia has boycotted the 47-nation assembly since January, angry at Western sanctions relating to its annexation of Crimea and help for rebels in eastern Ukraine.
PACE meets next week, but a debate on Mr Agramunt's position on Monday will no longer take place.
A Briton, Roger Gale, will replace them provisionally.
The former Columbia University student who famously carried a mattress around campus to draw attention to their alleged rape is back with yet another piece of provocative performance art.
On the surface, Emma Sulkowicz's latest art project has a lot more to do with sex as opposed to politics than their previous one; in the middle of an art gallery, the 24-year-old was tied up with rope while wearing just a bikini, then beaten with a belt by a man they called 'Master'.
But according to Emma, the play-acting S&M, however overtly sexual it might have appeared, was just a metaphor — for the inability of art to flourish under the Trump administration.
Shocking: Emma Sulkowicz's latest piece of performance art features BDSM
For several perforamce in New York, the 24-year-old was tied up and beaten in front of a crowd
They said people were shocked by the performance, though a crowd gathered to watch
Emma let a professional dominatrix named Master Avery hurl abusive insults at them before physically abusing them
They tied them up and bound them to a beam of wood hanging from the ceiling
Emma first rose to national prominence in 2014 while they were a fourth-year student at Columbia.
At the time, they accused a fellow classmate of raping them in their dorm room, bringing the charges to the attention of the university. Two other women also brought formal complaints against the accused, but in hearings, the school found the male student to be 'not responsible'.
Emma was also part of a larger complaint filed later against the university, alleging that it had mishandled sexual assault cases.
To bring even more attention to their situation, they staged a piece of performance art called Mattress Performance (Carry That Weight), in which they carried a 50lbs twin-sized mattress — like the one they claim they were raped on — around campus.
Now, in their latest piece, they are only playing the victim.
Shown at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts Project Space and documented by a reporter at Broadly, the performance kicked off with a pink-haired Emma standing in their section of the gallery in heels and a coat.
So stranger to statements: Emma first earned attention in 2014 when they protested Columbia University's handling of their alleged rape by carrying a twin mattress around campus
This performance was more explicitly sexual, starring Emma in heels and a revealing bikini
A reporter observing the performance said the ropes tied around them very clearly cut into their skin
Emma claims the piece is about the value of art in a country that's a 'sinking ship'
They said they questioned the importance or effectiveness of political art in a climate that diminishes it
Soon, the coat came off, revealing a skimpy bikini. An older bearded man, whom they called Master Avery — a professional dominatrix whom Emma considers a close friend —then approached them
They slung insults at her, telling them that their 'boobs were too small' and their posture was bad. They then got physical, using a rope to tie knots around their legs and waist.
They tied them to a wooden beam which was strung up to the ceiling, so Emma hung, bound and immobile, above the ground. They then began hitting them with a belt.
In a subsequent performance, with more 'intense' beatings, the male dominatrix even invited the crowd to participate. Only one man took them up on the offer, slapping Emma's face.
Though most of the audience was 'shocked', according to Emma, just one person was concerned enough to intervene, walking up to the young woman and asking them outright if they wished to be taken down.
They said: 'We're acting out this sadistic-masochistic relationship between the institution with all of its financial power, and this program [art] that wants to be political but can't be really because it's being tied up by this institution'
They added that the performance was 'a statement about the impotence of artwork during our given circumstances'
At the end of the performance, Emma was left tied up, so the audience had to take it upon themselves to untie them
In 2014, they carried a mattress - like the one they said they were raped on - around school
They accused a fellow classmate of rape (as did two other students), but the school ruled that they were not responsible
At the end of the performance, which ran several times, Master Avery walked away and left the audience to untie Emma from the beam.
Although perhaps not immediately apparent from the brutalities of the performance, Emma claims their project is meant to make people think about the value of art in the 'sinking ship' that is the US right now, insisting that it makes 'a statement about the impotence of artwork during our given circumstances'.
'If our country is falling to pieces and you have artists running around saying they're political artists, but really their art is hanging on a sinking ship, the ship is still sinking,' they said.
'I was thinking a lot about this — is it really possible for political artists to make work that makes the ship stop from sinking?'
They went on: 'We're acting out this sadistic-masochistic relationship between the institution with all of its financial power, and this program [art] that wants to be political but can't be really because it's being tied up by this institution.'
LINCOLN Neb. — A man with a hankering for pizza drove through the front door of a restaurant Wednesday.
The man, described as elderly by Lincoln's fire chief, crashed through the front doors of Valentino's Pizza just before noon on Wednesday. Once their car was through the doors, they ordered a pizza from inside their car.
"He was gonna go ahead and order some pizza. So they aren't too upset about it evidently," said witness Don Brouse told The Associated Press.
When emergency responders arrived, they took the man to the hospital. It was unclear whether or not they suffered any injuries, firefighters said, but their calm response to the crash could have indicated their cognitive functions were intact.
"It was like they do it every day," Brouse said.
Lincoln Fire Battalion Chief Leo Benes told The Associated Press that en route to the scene they were concerned that the crash would cause injury to patrons, but none were reported.
The man's small Honda Fit is just smaller than the restaurant's front doors, so no structural damage was caused by the car, officials said. The restaurant was closed while the health department inspected the premises, but Valentino's has already replaced the door.

As the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity convenes its first meeting on Wednesday, the issue of voter fraud in American elections has become even more contentious and hyperbolic.
One of the left's main arguments against reform is that voter fraud simply does not occur. How liberals arrive at this conclusion, we cannot say.
Time and again, studies and analyses point to one incontrovertible conclusion: that voter fraud is a real and pressing issue that deserves serious solutions, and The Heritage Foundation has the evidence to prove it.
On Thursday, The Heritage Foundation is releasing a new edition of its voter fraud database. Featuring well over 100 new cases, the database documents 1,071 instances of voter fraud spanning 47 states, including 938 criminal convictions.
This revamped edition of the database separates cases by type of disposition, allowing readers to easily distinguish not only what type of fraud occurred but the outcome of the case—criminal convictions, pre-trial diversion programs, and other types of adjudication used in various states and counties across the United States.
Below are a few of the egregious examples recently added to the database.
Virginia
Andrew Spieles, a former James Madison University student, pleaded guilty to a charge stemming from their false submission of 18 voter registration forms during the summer of 2016.
They had been working for Harrisonburg VOTES, a voter registration organization affiliated with the Democratic Party, and used false birth dates and Social Security numbers to register deceased persons to vote. Spieles was given prison time for their crime.
This incident is just one of hundreds of cases in the database where individuals illegally registered dead people, names out of the phone book, or others to vote.
While Spieles was caught before votes could be cast on behalf of those falsely registered individuals, there have been many other cases in which ballots were successfully cast in the name of deceased people.
In fact, a 2012 Pew study concluded that 1.8 million voters remained on the rolls after their passing—a grave vulnerability to the integrity of our elections.
Maryland
Fredericus Hubertus Slicher, an illegal alien living in Baltimore, was convicted of numerous charges in 2014. They were residing illegally in the United States, collecting Medicare and Social Security benefits, and voting in U.S. elections.
Slicher had been present in the United States illegally since their temporary work visa expired in 1969. They were convicted of child abuse in 2004, was a registered sex offender, and yet they continued to vote numerous times despite being ineligible.
Their case was referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and they were sentenced to three months' imprisonment, one year's supervised release, and was ordered to pay $48,928 in restitution.
The newest additions to the database included a dozen cases of illegal voting by noncitizens. This is a particularly important issue to address, as each ballot cast by a noncitizen effectively nullifies the ballot of an eligible voter, effectively disenfranchising American citizens.
Ohio
Debbie Tingler of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, pleaded guilty (Case No. 12 CR 005249) to illegal voting in 2013. They had registered to vote, requested absentee ballots, and submitted those ballots under two names—Debbie Tingler and Deborah Tingler.
They were given a suspended sentence of 120 days' imprisonment, and they were ordered to pay a $200 fine and court costs.
Tingler's experience is not uncommon. There are dozens of cases in the database where individuals voted multiple times in the same election.
Given the fact that few states have adequate policies and procedures in place to detect and deter fraud—and prosecutors seldom prioritize these cases—it is likely that far more double voters, absentee-ballot fraudsters, and ineligible voters get away scot-free than are ever brought to justice.
The Heritage Foundation's voter fraud database is by no means comprehensive, but its 1,071 proven instances of fraud, which took place across all manner of elections and in nearly every state, highlight the importance—and the urgency—of the work of the Election Integrity Commission.
What is needed now is more data to permit analysis aimed at determining, among other things, whether the nation's voter registration records are accurate or riddled with errors.
In the coming months, the commission—which includes Heritage's own Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow and one of the nation's foremost election law experts—will seek to gather this information.
Unfortunately, so far, even innocuous requests for public voter records have been met with hyperbolic rhetoric and stonewalling in some states.
This begs the question, why? If fraud is as rare as liberals say, and if state protections against it are as robust as we are told, why withhold data that would prove these claims?
Perhaps liberals are afraid that the data might, in fact, say the opposite.
One can deny facts for only so long, and with this newest release of The Heritage Foundation's voter fraud database, the evidence is clear and incontrovertible: Voter fraud is real, and we ignore it at our own peril.
PLANO (CBSDFW.COM) – With West Nile season approaching soon, there's a controversial bill in the state legislature that would give the government more power to kill mosquitoes.
Texas State Senate Bill 186 would allow authorities to legally trespass on private property without a warrant to treat stagnant water if it “…is reasonably presumed to be abandoned or that is uninhabited.”
State Senator John Carona introduced the bill telling CBS 11, “This is an important health and safety issue.”
Plano health officials believe it will help efforts to combat the West Nile Virus because it will allow for the immediate treatment of problem areas.
Plano resident David Johnson says the plan could have helped their neighborhood had it been in place last summer.
Johnson's family lives next to a home with a stagnant pool, which is prime breeding ground for mosquitoes. They complained to the City of Plano, which had to get a warrant to finally address the problem since the owner couldn't be found.
“It took months of notices on the door before any action was taken,” recalls Johnson. “It's just an absolute nightmare.”
But some legal experts worry that any exception to obtaining warrants will eventually lead to more government access of private property everywhere.
“Are we going to have the potential for government workers going into these houses without going through the proper steps?” questions attorney Pete Schulte. “Does this give the government too much leeway?”
The bill has several hurdles to overcome, including privacy concerns, before becoming law. However, those who live near high-risk areas say they fear an invasion of mosquitoes more than an invasion of privacy.
The 2012 West Nile season was the worst on record in Texas. More than 1800 were infected, 86 people died.

Speaking in a Wednesday meeting with people from different walks of life in Tehran, Ayatollah Khamenei said those who organize Iran's upcoming elections have the nation's trust, but they still should exercise utmost care and help protect people's votes.
“It is likely that some individuals seek to violate the law; however, these sectors – whether the executive, regulatory, or security sectors – are trustworthy and reliable, thank God; they should of course watch out,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, according to their official website.
The Leader further highlighted the significance of public discipline and the people's commitment to abide by laws before the election, on the day of the election and after the election.
“This is what many countries lack; and our nation proves to enjoy that: we have learned from experiences in the past. The Iranian nation has learned through experience that discipline is beneficial, and indiscipline unlawfulness can be so harmful,” Ayatollah Khamenei went on to say.
Elsewhere in their remarks, Ayatollah Khamenei also hailed the country's calm and peaceful atmosphere in the run-up to the May 19 elections while regional countries are insecure.
“Look at the regional countries. Is there any place where there is no insecurity? In this insecure assortment, the Islamic Republic is preparing for elections with security and calm,” the Leader noted, describing it as valuable.
As we're getting closer and closer to that official unveiling event of next week, we're getting more and more details of the HTC One Max, thanks to the internet. We've just recently seen an alleged spec-sheet that claims to be the real deal when it comes to the phablet's internals, and now, we're looking at the actual phablet, in real life, and not in a cubicle or on a table.
As if the close-to-six-inch form factor wasn't already huge, the HTC One Max appears to be even larger, thanks to the company's signature BoomSound, the top and bottom mounted speakers. We can, of course, argue that the lady holding the phone might have small hands, but still… Check out the image above, while we remind you of the specs leaked earlier today: quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor clocked at 1.7GHz — pretty much like the SoC powering the One — 2GB of RAM, 16/32/64GB internal storage options (expandable via microSD), 5.9-inch Full HD screen, Android 4.3 with Sense 5.5 on top of it.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — It may be almost August, but dirt-covered snow still hasn't completely melted since being dumped at a defunct Buffalo railroad station after November's record-breaking storm.
WGRZ-TV (http://on.wgrz.com/1D3yMPP ) reports that two snow piles nearly 10 feet high in some spots are still melting in vacant lots at the Central Terminal on the city's east side.
City crews dumped snow in the lots after a lake-effect storm dumped more than 7 feet on parts of Buffalo and the surrounding area the week before Thanksgiving. Eight months later, some of it is still there.
The two piles resemble earthen berms because the snow is covered with a thick layer of dirt with grass growing on it. Underneath the dirt, the remaining densely packed snow is slowly melting.

The United States is filled with controversies, but none quite as quirky and bizarre as the debate over who holds the world record for the largest ball of twine. Both Darwin, Minnesota and Cawker City, Kansas claim to have the largest in terms of length and width, but there is one twine ball title that goes undisputed: the world's heaviest ball of twine, which can be found hidden in the middle of northern Wisconsin.
At an estimated weight of 21,280 pounds, the World's Heaviest Ball of Twine was constructed by James Frank Kotera, nicknamed “JFK.” Over the past 37 years, JFK has spent tens of thousands of hours wrapping twine into a ball in an isolated house in Lake Nebagamon, Wisconsin.
Since 1979, JFK has spent three days a week working at a nearby dump and the other four days at home wrapping garbage bags full of twine in gigantic circles. In addition to the world's heaviest twine ball, JFK has also constructed “Junior”, a ball made of string that weighs 47 pounds in honor of Kotera's birth year, 1947. Kotera was born on February 2nd, which inspired the self-given nickname of “Groundhog.”
The few people that visit the ball of twine will be treated to a casual conversation with JFK, who will insist that they never gets tired of wrapping the twine and plans to never stop until they die. According to JFK, they used to be a drunkard, but that all changed in 1979, when they had a conversation with God who encouraged them to stop drinking and turn to twine. Ever since this conversation, JFK's painstaking effort has given them the grounds to claim that, in terms of weight, they truly have the world's biggest balls.
“I'm leaving the Senate now, but I'm not leaving the fight,” Mr. DeMint said in a statement. “I've decided to join the Heritage Foundation at a time when the conservative movement needs strong leadership in the battle of ideas.”

In a parting shot — or perhaps warning flare — Mr. DeMint on Thursday suggested to Rush Limbaugh that Mr. Boehner might need to watch their back. When asked if Mr. Boehner was forcing them out, Mr. DeMint replied, “It might work a little bit the other way, Rush.”
The job switch should have substantial financial benefits for Mr. DeMint, whose 2010 net worth, $65,000, was among the lowest in the Senate. Edwin J. Feulner, the current head of the foundation, in 2010 earned $1,098,612 in total compensation.
A hero to many Republicans for their campaign fund-raising abilities, Mr. DeMint frustrated Senate colleagues by eagerly backing Republican candidates like Sharron Angle of Nevada , Ken Buck of Colorado and Christine O'Donnell of Delaware in 2010, and Richard Mourdock of Indiana and Todd Akin of Missouri this year, contenders who proved too conservative to be elected statewide. Those losses set back Mr. DeMint's effort to bring the fiery conservatism of the House to the Senate, though they did have a hand in electing Senators Mike Lee of Utah , Marco Rubio of Florida , Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas , who takes office next month.
“The truth is that Jim DeMint's philosophy on everything from Medicare to women's reproductive rights, as embodied by their handpicked candidates for Congress, has been rejected by voters,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee this year. Privately, so as not to inflame him, several Republicans also said Mr. DeMint's departure would produce few tears among them.
Mr. DeMint's leadership PAC, the Senate Conservatives Fund, spent $5.48 million in the 2010 and 2012 elections, and out of 27 races that it stepped into, their preferred candidate won either the primary or general election 8 times.
The costly Senate defeats, as well as Mr. DeMint's proclivity for gumming up legislation on the floor, and their virtually nonexistent legislative productivity, stunted their chances for leadership in the Senate.

Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, a Republican, will now be compelled to appoint a successor who would then run to maintain the seat in a special election in 2014, when Senator Lindsey Graham , the senior senator from the state and a fellow Republican, will also be up for re-election. Aides said that Ms. Haley was surprised by Mr. DeMint's announcement.

South Carolina is a small state, politically speaking, and almost every Republican member of the House delegation, many of them close to Mr. DeMint politically and personally, are possible fill-ins.
Representative Tim Scott is a popular first-year student from Charleston who is well known around the state from having served on Charleston County Council for 13 years and in the State House of Representatives for two years. The first black Republican to serve their state in Congress since the late 19th century, Mr. Scott could give Republicans a high-profile black member of the Senate, which has no black members from either party. Mr. Scott, who shares a political consultant with Ms. Haley, is believed to have other ambitions, including a possible run for governor.

While a fellow Republican first-year student, Mick Mulvaney, might also like the job, they do not have a close relationship to Ms. Haley in a job and state where such ties matter, and the delegation is expected to coalesce around Mr. Scott. What's more, there are many Republicans in the state who would love to have a run at Mr. Scott's seat.
Ms. Haley, who said that they would not appoint herself, is most likely to frame their choice around their own re-election efforts.  They are a ripe target for a conservative primary challenge.
“Our state's loss is the Heritage Foundation's gain,” Ms. Haley said in a statement. “I wish Jim and Heritage all the best in continuing our shared commitment to America's greatness.”
The distraction of a new seat may well benefit Mr. Graham, who has taken some positions on immigration and climate change that have drawn fire in their very conservative state. On the Senate floor Thursday, Mr. Graham said that their state was losing “a great strong conservative voice,” and that “on a personal level I've lost a colleague and friend.” Their relationship, they said, at times was “playing the good cop, the bad cop, but we were always trying to work together.”
Right now, there's a lot of interest, hope, concern and trepidation about brain science. In this guest blog, Prof. James Giordano, co-Editor-in-Chief of Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine , calls for the field and practices of neuroethics to address and steer neuroscientific research and its applications.
The promise of brain science to better the quality of life Flickr
Some very recent studies have demonstrated alterations in implicit bias through the use of memory modification during sleep, and the ability to alter ‘sacred values' through the use of narratives that affect neuro-cognitive reasoning and justification processes.
Studies are also currently expanding uses of deep brain stimulation to affect a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions and states, and there is a rapidly growing use of neuromodulatory technologies in clinical, occupational and general public settings to modify mood, and improve performance on certain cognitive and behavioral tasks.
Furthermore, for the near future there are projects that seek to push the boundaries of neuroscientific capability into the realms of what heretofore was considered to be only fictional.
The promise – and problems – of brain science
The promise of brain science lies in its capabilities to reduce the burden of neurological and psychiatric disease, to afford methods and tools to assist, if not better, daily living, and to improve the quality of life.
Yet, these very same methods and tools can be, and are, viewed as the engines of dystopia, conjuring visions of mind reading and thought control, fostering a widening gap between the neurotechnologically enhanced and those not, and opening a veritable Pandora's Box of potential problems and harms spawned by unanticipated effects or ‘runaway' science.
This, coupled with the push from the BRAIN initiative has prompted release of recommendations by the US Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues that offer a basis for neuroethical address.
Brain science at work on the world stage
But these recommendations, while sound, do not detail how to engage neuroethical direction, or provide guidance through the complex fields, if not morass of social, cultural, economic, and sometimes political variables and contexts that color the ways that the knowledge and tools of brain science can and perhaps should be used.
Neuroscience is, and is becoming ever more, a global social force. Recent and near term growth of non-Western bio- and neurotechnology investments, research and use will increasingly affect international economics, and the ways that different socio-cultural markets view, value and influence neuroscientific translation and its applications.
Neuroethics for this new vista – and reality – of brain science must appreciate current and emerging trends in both technology and the social sphere, and should not be bounded by the sole adherence to, or use of, Western ideas, ideals or values.
We need to be prepared for the questions, problems – and solutions – that such cutting edged science will incur in specific and ‘real world' circumstances and contexts.
This demands a broader, more inclusive orientation to multicultural perspectives so as to insure that neuroethical address and approaches are directly relevant, realistic and remain applied to the problems and possibilities generated by neuroscience upon the twenty first century world stage.
Neuroethics needs to keep pace
Arguably, this is both important and necessary if neuroethics is to keep pace with the brain sciences – and social concerns – it serves. In other words, there should be no new neuroscience without neuroethics. We need to be prepared for the questions, problems – and solutions – that such cutting edged science will incur in specific and ‘real world' circumstances and contexts.
This will require dedicated investment to accurately define and address neuroethico-legal and social issues inherent and derivative to the most current neuroscience and technology; not to restrict research or its translation, but to maximize its value.
Without doubt neuroscience will enable new knowledge and tools, and it is important to cultivate brain research and its translation. But it is equally, if not most important to ask – and guide – what we will do with such insight and tools, and to prudently establish how such guidance will be developed and enacted. Simply put, given the momentum and breadth of brain science, to do otherwise would be folly.
Hope you're not bored playing your 6-year-old Xbox 360 or 5-year-old PlayStation 3 just yet.
Gaming blog Kotaku reports that Microsoft and Sony aren't launching a new console until 2014, due to strong Xbox 360 and PS3 sales.
"Both MS and Sony are telegraphing to each other that they're delaying, to milk the current [generation] and fill in previous craters better," said an anonymous source, who Kotaku described as an "insider who has worked with the first-party companies like Sony and Microsoft."
Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 in 2005, while Sony unveiled the PS3 in 2006. So based on the traditional five-year lifecycle of gaming consoles, a refresh is due this year.
However, both companies appear to be enjoying strong console sales. Last week, Sony reported that it has sold more than 50 million PlayStation 3 units worldwide since 2006, despite taking a reputation hit with all the PS3 hacker lawsuits. NPD recently called Microsoft's Xbox 360 the best-selling hardware system during the non-holiday months, thanks to the launch of the Kinect motion sensor. Furthermore, in March Microsoft announced that it had sold more than 10 million Kinect sensors since November, earning it a Guinness World Record for fastest-selling consumer electronics device.
Speaking to another "insider," Kotaku reports that Microsoft will likely push out Kinect upgrades rather than release an entirely new console. The source also said Microsoft hasn't decided what will be the "next big thing" in its next-generation console.
Does anybody? In March Nintendo USA president Reggie Fils-Aime ruled out 3D technology as the killer app in its next-generation console.
Meanwhile, there are many compelling signs that Nintendo is announcing its next-generation console this June at the E3 Expo in Los Angeles, suggesting a potential launch in 2012.

It is now generally recognized that rooftop solar has reached “socket parity” -- meaning that it is comparable to or cheaper than grid prices -- in many countries over the last few years. The big question for consumers and utilities is when socket parity will arrive for solar and battery storage.
Some suggest it is many years away. Others, such as UBS and Rocky Mountain Institute, say it could arrive in Australia and the U.S. within four to six years, and perhaps even sooner.
The following graph, from the economic development agency Germany Trade and Invest, outlines the metric that will govern the arrival of grid parity for battery storage. Electricity prices are rising and solar PV prices are falling, which means that if battery storage falls to around €0.20 per kilowatt-hour (U.S. $0.27), parity will be achieved.
Australian investment firm Morgans, in an assessment of Brisbane-based battery storage developer Redflow, suggests that that company's zinc-bromine flow battery may already be commercially economic in Germany, the country that leads the world in terms of household adoption and government support for renewables.
Morgan notes that in Germany, the cost of household grid power is around €0.30 per kilowatt-hour (U.S. $0.40) and that the government is now subsidizing residential energy storage systems that are connected to solar systems.
“Given Germany's substantial adoption of solar PV...costs for solar power range from €0.10 to €0.15 per kilowatt-hour (half the grid price), so when energy storage costs reach €0.15 to €0.20, this will mean renewable energy costs will be at parity with grid prices,” Morgans concludes.
The German government is currently subsidizing up to €3,000 of the cost of energy storage systems. Morgan says that the €0.15 to €0.20 per kilowatt-hour range for energy storage costs, combined with the German government's €3,000 subsidy for energy storage systems, means the Redflow battery will be competitive if the company can triple the device's cycle life.
“In our view, this should be achievable,” according to the analysis.

I started writing this essay last week, about the next mass shooting. It hadn't happened yet, but we all knew it was going to. We didn't know then whether it would be in a school or a workplace, a mall or a theater or a military base, in Maryland or Idaho, Chicago or some small town we'd never heard of before, suddenly elevated to infamy. We didn't know the killer's name or how many people would die. But we did know some things for certain.
We knew there would be grief: genuine on the part of relatives and friends, professionally simulated by media personalities, journalists, politicians, spokespeople, and pundits. There would be anguished calls to understand how this could have happened. The question "Why?" would be posed. There would be outraged calls for gun control by liberals, and pro forma calls for better monitoring of the mentally ill by gun lobbyists. The Culture of Violence would be decried. The word tragedy would be used, and the word senseless, and, within minutes, politicize, and, after a few days, the phrase come together as a community, and the word healing. Ultimately, nothing at all would be done and we'd forget all about it again, until the next one.
I didn't write fast enough. The next mass shooting has already happened. Over the holiday weekend, some guy went on a petulant killing spree in California, killing a half dozen people, three by stabbing and three with guns, because girls didn't like him. A senseless tragedy that will all too soon be politicized. I personally deplore the culture of violence that leads to such acts. We cannot help, at such a time, but wonder Why. But I, like you, have faith that Santa Barbara will soon come together as a community and begin the process of healing.
Look, we've collectively decided, as a country, that the occasional massacre is okay with us. It's the price we're willing to pay for our precious Second Amendment freedoms. We're content to forfeit the lives of a few dozen schoolkids a year as long as we get to keep our guns. The people have spoken, in a cheering civics-class example of democracy in action.
It's hard to imagine what ghastly catastrophe could possibly change America's minds about guns if the little bloody bookbags of Newtown did not. After that atrocity, it seemed as if we would finally enact some obvious, long-overdue half-measures. But perfectly reasonable, moderate legislation expanding background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines was summarily killed in the Senate for no reason other than that a sufficient number of United States senators are owned by the NRA. It made our official position as a nation nakedly explicit: We don't care about any number of murdered children, no matter how many, or how young. We want our guns.
I realize we are not all equally complicit in this indifference; there's a spectrum of culpability. I don't even bother to hold the NRA or the politicians they own accountable for the deaths they allow, any more than I blame deer ticks or herpes for doing their jobs. Gun lobbyists are just engines of greed, businesslike and efficient as HIV. Politicians will do whatever will get them re-elected. And gun owners are simply frightened; anyone who buys a handgun is, self-evidently, afraid of something. Plenty of them are decent, fun, likable, kindhearted people, but fear can make normal people behave vilely. And as an electoral bloc they've made the calculation that placating their own imaginary terrors is more important than the lives of what will probably, after all, be some stranger's kids. And luckily kids don't get to vote.
The coalition of Greed and Fear seems invincible. No appeals to reason or decency can affect either of those factions; it's like arguing with addicts or bacilli. They will never modify their position because their position isn't rational — it's driven by deep feelings of impotence and fear they can't even admit to, and funded by cemeteries full of money. If gun laws are ever going to change in this country, it'll have to be because people like me, people who care except not quite enough, quit their bitter impotent griping and actually do something about it. We care in the way that carnivores care about the screaming in slaughterhouses or that pro-war voters care about families accidentally blown apart in Iraq. Which is to say, sorta — just not enough to change our minds or habits or do anything hard or inconvenient.
An annoying thing about living in a republic is that you can't feel completely blameless for the ruinous state of your nation. But the happy loophole is that responsibility for decision-making is so broadly diffused across millions of your fellow citizens that you can always tell yourself that you did what you could but the Other Guys steamrolled you so it's all their fault. My own contribution toward ending gun violence so far has been to feel sick with rage and loathing toward the NRA. Occasionally I'll draw a mean cartoon about it. It's easy and fun to mock gun fanatics, because they're so selfish and scared and weak and mean. It's also pointless, an exercise in frustration and helplessness. Seeing the NRA repeatedly defeat any gun legislation, brutally effective as the Soviets crushing an uprising, has incrementally demoralized me and given me an excuse to give up. As Ernesto Cortes Jr. wrote: "powerlessness also corrupts."
So how about let's actually do something for once? Write your senators or member of congress, your state representatives, your governor. Become a single-issue voter. I'm sorry to say it, but the most effective thing you can do is probably to send a check to a gun-control lobby group, since it should be clear by now that the only voice that matters in American governance is that of money. We need to buy up and bully some senators of our own. Why not do it right now? Because it's too late for the victims in California, but we don't know when the next mass shooting might happen; I haven't seen the news yet today, so for all I know it already happened this morning. If not, it'll happen next week, or two or six months from now. But we do know it's going to happen. Some parents out there reading this and shaking their heads in vague sorrow are already doomed to unimaginable grief.
If we're not going to do anything again, I'd just like to make one request: given that we've all agreed, if only by our passive acquiescence, not to keep this from happening, can we please quit pretending to care? Let's just skip the histrionics this time: no pro forma shock, condolence photo ops, somber speeches, flags at half-mast, meaningless noises from liberals about legislation, meaningless counter-noises from the NRA about armed guards in elementary schools. Why bother going through the motions of soul-searching when we know very well there's nothing to search? If we can't be brave we might at least be honest: when we see the familiar helicopter shots of ambulances outside a school, the clusters of classmates hugging, the sobbing parents being led away, the makeshift shrines of candles and plush toys, instead of looking stricken or covering our mouths or saying "Oh my God" or "How horrible," let's just all look each other in the eye and say: "Shit happens."
Editor's note: This article originally incorrectly attributed the quote "powerlessness also corrupts." It has since been corrected. We regret the error.
At GoCardless we use Elasticsearch to power the search functionality of our dashboards. When we were building our Pro API, we decided to rethink how we got data into Elasticsearch.
At a high level, the problem is that you have your data in one place (for us, that's Postgres), and you want to keep a copy of it in Elasticsearch. This means every write you make ( INSERT , UPDATE and DELETE statements) needs to be replicated to Elasticsearch. At first this sounds easy: just add some code which pushes a document to Elasticsearch after updating Postgres, and you're done.
But what happens if Elasticsearch is slow to acknowledge the update? What if Elasticsearch processes those updates out of order? How do you know Elasticsearch processed every update correctly?
We thought those issues through, and decided our indexes had to be:
Updated asynchronously - The user's request should be delayed as little as possible.
- The user's request should be delayed as little as possible. Eventually consistent - While it can lag behind slightly, serving stale results indefinitely isn't an option.
- While it can lag behind slightly, serving stale results indefinitely isn't an option. Easy to rebuild - Updates can be lost before reaching Elasticsearch, and Elasticsearch itself is known to lose data under network partitions.
Updating asynchronously
This is the easy part. Rather than generating and indexing the Elasticsearch document inside the request cycle, we enqueue a job to resync it asynchronously. Those jobs are processed by a pool of workers, either individually or in batches - as you start processing higher volumes, batching makes more and more sense.
Leaving the JSON generation and Elasticsearch API call out of the request cycle helps keep our API response times low and predictable.
Ensuring consistency
The easiest way to get data into Elasticsearch is via the update API, setting any fields which were changed. Unfortunately, this offers no safety when it comes to concurrent updates, so you can end up with old or corrupt data in your index.
To handle this, Elasticsearch offers a versioning system with optimistic locking. Every write to a document causes its version to increment by 1. When posting an update, you read the current version of a document, increment it and supply that as the version number in your update. If someone else has written to the document in the meantime, the update will fail. Unfortunately, it's still possible to have an older update win under this scheme. Consider a situation where users Alice and Bob make requests which update some data at the same time:
Alice Bob Postgres update commits - Elasticsearch request delayed - - Postgres update commits - Reads v2 from Elasticsearch - Writes v3 to Elasticsearch Reads v3 from Elasticsearch - Writes v4 to Elasticsearch Changes lost
This may seem unlikely, but it isn't. If you're making a lot of updates, especially if you're doing them asynchronously, you will end up with bad data in your search cluster. Fortunately, Elasticsearch provides another way of doing versioning. Rather than letting it generate version numbers, you can set version_type to external in your requests, and provide your own version numbers. Elasticsearch will always keep the highest version of a document you send it.
Since we're using Postgres, we already have a great version number available to us: transaction IDs. They're 64-bit integers, and they always increase on new transactions. Getting hold of the current one is as simple as:
SELECT txid_current ();
The asynchronous job simply selects the current transaction ID, loads the relevent data from Postgres, and sends it to Elasticsearch with that ID set as the version. Since this all happens after the data is committed in Postgres, the document we send to Elasticsearch is at least as up to date as when we enqueued the asynchronous job. It can be newer (if another transaction has committed in the meantime), but that's fine. We don't need every version of every record to make it to Elasticsearch. All we care about is ending up with the newest one once all our asynchronous jobs have run.
Rebuilding from scratch
The last thing to take care of is to handle any inconsistencies from lost updates. We do so by periodically resyncing all recently written Postgres records, and the same code allows us to easily rebuild our indexes from scratch without downtime.
With the asynchronous approach above, and without a transactional, Postgres-backed queue, it's possible to lose updates. If an app server dies after committing the transaction in Postgres, but before enqueueing the sync job, that update won't make it to Elasticsearch. Even with a transactional, Postgres-backed queue there is a chance of losing updates for other reasons (such as the issues under network partition mentioned earlier).
To handle the above, we decided to periodically resync all recently updated records. To do this we use Elasticsearch's Bulk API, and reindex anything which was updated after the last resync (with a small overlap to make sure no records get missed by this catch-up process).
The great thing about this approach is you can use the same code to rebuild the entire index. You'll need to do this routinely, when you change your mappings, and it's always nice to know you can recover from disaster.
On the point of rebuilding indexes from scratch, you'll want to do that without downtime. It's worth taking a look at how to do this with aliases right from the start. You'll avoid a bunch of pain later on.
Closing thoughts
There's a lot more to building a great search experience than you can fit in one blog post. Different applications have different constraints, and it's worth thinking yours through before you start writing production code. That said, hopefully you'll find some of the techniques in this post useful.
NEWARK, N.J. (AP) — After an expensive legal fight, a former prosecutor who sued Gov. Chris Christie's administration over their 2010 firing has been granted access by a judge to secret grand jury transcripts they say will help show they were terminated because they questioned the dropping of an indictment that involved a Christie donor who served on the governor's transition team.
The ruling by state Superior Court Judge Douglas Hurd, given to attorneys Friday, is the latest chapter in a lengthy dispute that has cost taxpayers nearly $2 million in legal fees incurred as the state has sought to block the transcripts' release, according to figures obtained by The Associated Press.
Former assistant Hunterdon County prosecutor Bennett Barlyn contends in a lawsuit filed in 2012 that they were fired shortly after the state took over, and subsequently dismissed, a 43-count indictment against then-county Sheriff Deborah Trout and two subordinates that charged them with offenses including official misconduct and falsification of employment records.
The state claimed it dismissed the indictment — which had been handed up by the grand jury after hearing evidence presented by the Hunterdon County prosecutor's office — because of legal and factual deficiencies. Barlyn said that, rather than fix the problems and resubmit it to the grand jury, the attorney general's office dropped the indictment “for corrupt political purposes.”
According to Barlyn's lawsuit, a material witness in the investigation was Dr. Robert Hariri, who with their wife donated more than $10,000 to Christie's 2009 gubernatorial campaign and later was part of the Republican governor's transition team. The lawsuit claims Hariri, who wasn't charged, was believed to be one of the people given a fake law enforcement ID card by one of the defendants, Undersheriff Michael Russo.
The lawsuit also contends all three defendants were Christie supporters and that Russo told a reporter that Christie would step in and “have this whole thing thrown out.”
Christie has repeatedly denied having any involvement in the dropping of the indictment, and they are not a defendant in Barlyn's lawsuit. The suit names former state Attorney General Paula Dow, a Christie nominee, and several other state and county law enforcement officials.
A spokesperson for the state attorney general's office had no comment on the ruling Wednesday and said the office hadn't decided whether it would appeal.
Gibbons, a Newark-based law firm, billed the state $1.7 million for work on the case from May 2014 when it was retained through the end of this May, according to records obtained by the AP.
“The grand jury record is the proverbial smoking gun evidence needed to prove my whistleblower claim,” Barlyn said in an email. “This explains why the Christie administration has expended so much tax payer money to keep it from me.”
Barlyn, a former state deputy attorney general who handled appeals for the Hunterdon County prosecutor's office in the manslaughter trial of former NBA star Jayson Williams, has contended in numerous court filings that the grand jury materials in the Trout case will show the indictment was backed up by evidence and shouldn't have been dropped.
Attorneys representing the state argued that the transcripts' relevance was questionable and that releasing them would set a dangerous precedent and have a chilling effect on future witnesses. Grand jury proceedings are closed and witness testimony is kept secret, with rare exceptions.

With the Chicago Bears, it has always been about defense. From George Halas' heyday to the reincarnation of the "Monsters of the Midway" under Mike Ditka, this organization has always leaned on its defense to spearhead championship pursuits.

This tradition continued under Lovie Smith, the former head coach and defensive coordinator who guided the franchise to Super Bowl XLI on the strength of a ferocious D that pummeled opponents with physicality and toughness. Although the Bears failed to secure the franchise's second Lombardi Trophy during Smith's tenure, Chicago remained in contention on the strength of its defense alone.
However, a desire to take the franchise to another level prompted Phil Emery to think outside the box. To replace Smith, the Bears general manager settled on Marc Trestman, an innovative offensive mastermind who can revive a dormant unit that lacked the punch to compete with the high-octane attacks ruling today's NFL.
While change is always met with a degree of skepticism, I believe the move to an offensively oriented head coach could produce fireworks in the Windy City, allowing Chicago to compete for a title soon. Here are four reasons why:
1) Marc Trestman's innovative approach will test defensive coordinators.
The fascination with Chip Kelly's offense in Philadelphia has dominated offseason headlines, but Trestman's wizardry in Chicago could make for the bigger story by season's end. The highly experienced coach has been behind some of the most prolific offenses in recent memory -- this cannot be ignored.
As the offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach of the San Francisco 49ers in 1995, Trestman directed an attack that led the NFL in scoring and passing yards while ranking second in total offense. Jerry Rice set an NFL record with 1,848 receiving yards -- a mark that lasted until Calvin Johnson topped it last season -- while logging 122 receptions and 15 touchdown catches. Trestman orchestrated another high-powered unit as offensive coordinator for the 2002 Oakland Raiders, who led the league in total offense and passing yards per game on their way to making an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVII.
Those feats certainly validate Trestman's strengths as a savvy play caller, but it is their work as a head coach in the Canadian Football League that should have observers intrigued by the Bears' offensive potential. In guiding the Montreal Alouettes to three Grey Cup appearances and two titles in five seasons at the helm, Trestman melded their traditional West Coast offense with a fast-paced approach that featured multiple formations, constant motion and a variety of personnel groupings.
I spoke to a former CFL defender who is familiar with Trestman, and they described the 57-year-old as a "mad scientist" with a creative mind and an aggressive disposition. They raved about Trestman's willingness to push the envelope with tempo and pacing, and they suggested that opponents should expect to see a complex, quick-rhythm passing attack complemented by a diverse screen package as the basis of the game plan. They also anticipated Trestman using a variety of unbalanced formations and odd personnel packages designed to keep defenders guessing on a down-by-down basis.
When I asked the former CFL defender to compare Trestman's offensive structure to a current NFL system, they pointed to the multifaceted schemes of the New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers. Each of those offenses features multiple personnel packages and formations to create advantages at the line of scrimmage.
2) Jay Cutler finally gets a quarterback-friendly system in Chicago.
In today's NFL, teams must structure their offenses around the strengths of the quarterback. The top offensive coordinators design game plans with the intention of putting the signal-caller in the best situation to succeed.
Cutler wasn't given the opportunity to maximize their talents under previous play callers in Chicago (Ron Turner, Mike Martz and Mike Tice). They were asked to play in high-risk/high-reward systems that placed a premium on vertical throws but failed to protect them or provide sufficient options to counter the blitz-heavy tactics of opponents. Additionally, Cutler wasn't provided with enough chances to make the kinds of confidence-boosting, high-percentage throws that foster the rhythm necessary to consistently pick apart defenses. As a result, during their tenure with the Bears, Cutler has completed just 59.6 percent of their passes and compiled an underwhelming 82:63 touchdown-to-interception ratio. Factor in the 148 sacks and countless hits taken by Cutler, and it's easy to see why they haven't played up to their potential in Chicago.
I would expect that to change under Trestman, based on the coach's distinguished reputation as a quarterback guru. They helped Steve Young earn Pro Bowl recognition in 1996, and Rich Gannon netted the 2002 NFL MVP under their guidance. Most recently, Trestman transformed a wily veteran, Anthony Calvillo, into a CFL superstar. With each of those quarterbacks, Trestman implemented a quick-rhythm passing game that featured a number of high-percentage throws designed to get the ball into the hands of top playmakers on the perimeter. Most importantly, they crafted systems that kept those quarterbacks from taking a pounding in the pocket, leading to better play and more production from the passing game.
I expect to see Cutler operating an aerial attack built exclusively on three- and five-step drops, with short and intermediate routes on the perimeter. They will throw a number of slants and stick routes to take advantage of the size of their top receivers (Brandon Marshall is listed at 6-foot-4, 230 pounds, Alshon Jeffery checks in at 6-3, 216 and Martellus Bennett stands an imposing 6-6, 255). Additionally, Cutler will be asked to throw more crossing routes designed to get the ball to their playmakers on the move while also giving them an effective counter to the blitzes opponents favor against the Bears. These routes, which are staples of the West Coast offense, are also ideally suited for a strong-armed thrower with a quick release like Cutler. Just look at how well it worked in the video clip above.
The Bears will continue to take shots down the field, but they'll do so selectively, specifically dialing them up against favorable matchups on the outside or against blitz pressure. Cutler is a superb fade thrower, and their receivers excel at winning 50-50 balls, using their size and physicality to ward off defenders. These traits should encourage Cutler to take more shots in a system designed to create (and exploit) one-on-one matchups. Check out the video clip to the right -- there's more of that to come.
The 2013 season is a contract year for Cutler, and Trestman will put them in the best possible position to earn big bucks.
3) Matt Forte is a potential 1,000/100 back in Trestman's offense.
Forte is arguably the most complete back in the NFL, but they have been underutilized for most of their career in Chicago. Rarely has they received 20-plus carries in a game, and the team seemingly scaled back their involvement in the passing game in recent years, to boot. While team officials suggested the plan was to preserve them for big games down the stretch, it certainly didn't make sense to see such a gifted back playing a minimal role at times.
Expect Forte to become a major contributor in Trestman's offense. The sixth-year pro will be utilized as a dual-threat weapon out of the backfield. As one of the top pass-catching running backs in the NFL, Forte will become an integral part of the game plan, a do-it-all playmaker on the perimeter. They will align in various spots in open formations to create mismatches on the outside. Given their superb route-running skills and strong hands, Forte could become a nightmare to defend, especially with opponents placing an emphasis on slowing down Marshall in the passing game.
Additionally, Forte's ability to do damage on screen passes -- which are a big part of Trestman's playbook -- could take the Bears' offense to another level. Getting Forte free on the perimeter with a few lead blockers could result in big plays, as evidenced in the video to the right. Trestman used Charlie Garner in a similar capacity with Oakland in 2002, and the veteran running back totaled 1,903 yards from scrimmage (962 rushing yards; 91 receptions for 941 receiving yards).
Given Forte's unique skills as a runner/receiver, it is very possible the Bears star could become just the second running back in NFL history to rush for 1,000 yards and catch 100 balls (LaDainian Tomlinson did it 2003).
4) This receiving corps is more dangerous than the 2012 group.
The one-dimensional nature of the Bears' passing game elevated Marshall to elite status, but it made the unit easy to defend in big games. This season, however, the emergence of Jeffery and Earl Bennett as key contributors, plus the addition of Martellus Bennett at tight end, will make Chicago's passing game tougher to stop. Let's take a closer look at each of those guys:
Alshon Jeffery: In Jeffery, the Bears have an imposing pass catcher with the size and strength to overwhelm defenders on the perimeter. They showed flashes of that ability in an injury-riddled rookie campaign, catching 24 passes for 367 yards and three scores in 10 games (six starts). Although they primarily received their touches on vertical routes (fades and posts), Jeffery has shown promise in other areas of the route tree. With a full offseason to master the nuances of the position, they could be a legitimate threat on the outside.
Earl Bennett: Bennett is the ideal WR3 in a West Coast offense.  They are big enough to handle the physicality on the outside and quick enough to win on option routes between the hashes. Also, he's a good runner after the catch, which makes them an effective playmaker on quick screens. (Check out the video to the right.) This is particularly important in a new system that places a premium on getting the ball out of Cutler's hands quickly.
Martellus Bennett: The acquisition of Bennett gives Cutler a big body to target between the hashes. The sixth-year pro enjoyed a breakout season in 2012 with the New York Giants, piling up 55 receptions for 626 yards and five touchdowns. Most importantly, they finally played up to their potential by using their athleticism and receiving skills to control the middle of the field. With opponents employing various forms of Cover 2 to neutralize Marshall on the outside, the Bears can exploit the middle with Bennett running down the seams. Additionally, they give Cutler another big target to find when the field condenses in the red zone. If Bennett can pick up where they left off in 2012, they can add a whole new dimension to this offense.

Over the last week, article after article have condemned the ruling of the Ultra-Orthodox Belz community, who announced that women are not allowed to drive, and that children of mothers who do drive will face expulsion from their schools.
Yet I think that our response to Belz actually tells us an awful lot about ourselves – namely, that just as we accuse Belz of burying their head in the sand regarding modern norms, we bury our head in the sand when it comes to the contents of Jewish tradition. In our justifiable desire to condemn a clearly harmful decision, we overstep the boundary, and engage in rhetoric that reflects a lack of intellectual honesty, rewriting Jewish tradition to make us feel good about ourselves.
Let me take, for example, the article by Dina Brawer, a leader of the Orthodox feminist movement in England. The article, entitled “Real Orthodox Jews don`t ban women from driving” makes the claim that the idea of banning women from driving is “absolutely unheard of in Judaism, having no basis in any Jewish text.” What Mrs Brawer has done here is not merely to condemn the decision by Belz (I stress, a condemnation that I totally agree with). They have made the bold claim that there is absolutely no basis for the position taken by Belz in Jewish texts, and “real” Judaism does not believe in this.
Yet this simplistic approach is demonstrably false. Is there really no basis whatsoever in Jewish texts for a curtailing of women`s freedoms, when Maimonides writes in their code of law that, “A man should let their wife out of the house once or twice a month”? Does our conceptions of women`s freedoms really fit with the statement of the Sages of the Midrash that Dina, the daughter of Jacob, was punished because they left their house? Does our view of women`s rights fit comfortably with the Sages` praise of Tamar, the daughter in law of Judah, for veiling their entire body, save one eye to allow them to see? (And let me really raise the stakes here by asking the following question to Mrs Brawer particularly – if the legitimacy of ideas is judged by extent to which they have a “basis in Jewish texts,” is there not more basis in Jewish texts for the curtailing of women`s rights, than for the ordination of a woman as a Rabbi, something that Mrs Brawer plans to do?)
Do I believe that women cannot leave their houses, or must veil their entire body? Of course not! The achievement of women`s rights is unquestionably one of the most important developments in recent, even human, history, and one that is certainly compatible with Judaism. There are countless times over Jewish history where Judaism has been enriched by incorporating the norms, ideas and changes of the societies around us, and a changing place for women in Judaism is just one example of this. There is a very strong basis in Judaism for women`s rights – not least, the fact that the classic verse in Bereshit symbolising female subjugation, “And They (your husband) shall rule over you,” is expressed as a punishment for the Sin in the Garden of Eden – female subjugation was not in God`s initial plan for the world.
But my beliefs about the changing place of women does not mean that I feel the need to rewrite Jewish tradition so that every Jewish text over the past three thousand years is fully in accordance with the liberal values which I believe today. If we, as modern Jews, accuse Belz of burying their heads in the sand, and failing to deal with the reality of our world, then I would accuse many of us of burying our heads in the sand, and failing to deal with the complexity of our tradition.
Simplistically ignoring those elements of our tradition that do not fit our values today is an affront to our intellectual honesty. To argue with our more extreme coreligionists that their rulings are not “real” Judaism is counterproductive, as it is engaging in a debate that we will actually lose. I am proud, as a Jew, to believe in women`s rights. But equally, in the name of intellectual honesty, I refuse to rewrite three thousand years of Jewish tradition in order to fit my values.
Hello,
My name is Stacie Huckeba I have been a customer of Comcast for over eight years.
I realize that it's a dirty little secret and you don't like to talk about it, but c'mon, between just you and me, you can admit it. Basically you have a monopoly on internet service, at least in terms of speed. It's ok, I like money too. Nobody is happier than me when I deposit big fat checks. Sadly, I'm not quite as “connected” as you guys.
I'm a photographer and I think I'm really good, unfortunately, I live in a town with a plethora of talented photographers so I can't just sit back and be lazy. I've sent emails to the Mayor, and Governor and even my Senators and Congressmen asking that they put in regulations to make sure I am the only photographer who can use professional and top of the line equipment in town. Weird, they don't get back to me. One of you guys will have to tell me how you got them to do that for you. It would be so awesome to deposit those big fat checks knowing that I had no competition and could just be lazy, put out half-assed work and charge whatever I wanted because I was the only one in town who could deliver print ready work. God, I bet those feel so good going in the bank!
So, as much as I admire your business model, I am having some trouble. Back in November, I realized that I was utilizing Hulu and Netflix because of travel, work etc. far more than I was cable and I never had a land line to begin with. I mean can you even buy a phone that plugs into the wall anymore? I'm not sure.
I called to cancel my Triple Play Package and was talked into keeping it because I was really saving all this money by having it all. On a side note, I think it's brilliant that the people who sell your services are all super easy to work with, you never have to hold for more than a second and you never have to get transferred. They can do everything through one representative fast and efficiently. They are also open seven days a week. While technical support and cancellation departments are a minimum hold time of twenty minutes, you get transferred sometimes 5, 6, even 7 times and each and every time, you have to start from the beginning with your name, address, account information and then tell the whole story as to why you called over and over again, making the whole process almost unbearable. And only having the option to talk to them during normal business hours is genius. I mean, how great would it be to have a person who booked all my shoots, (and there would be a lot, since no one else in town could do them) happily just raking in the money while I had another person who basically told all of my unhappy clients to get bent? God, you guys are so good!
Anyway, back to my problem. I realized over the holidays last year that I really was not using it and in late January, I called back and asked for my account to be downgraded from the Triple Play (I had the full package with the fastest download speed available. Again, your sales team is tops!) to just the internet at the Performance Starter for download speeds of up to 6 Mbps. I returned my cable box / DVR and other equipment in early February.
I was really having no trouble whatsoever with my service and actually had not really noticed a difference in my internet speeds whatsoever. In late April, I received a delivery from UPS from Comcast. When I opened it, there was a new cable box / DVR inside. I called about it and you know how this goes already. I spent literally over three hours on the phone in one of the most grueling, frustrating, infuriating series of transfers, hang ups, and different representative pass-offs, in history. It is a miracle I did not wind up curled in a corner talking to spiders. But alas, I had a photo shoot with Jason Ringenberg and some live chickens that day and had no choice but to get my head in the game. (I know you think I'm making that up, but I'm not. It really happened and I have the pictures to prove it.)
The cliff notes of that three hour transfer are this. You guys never actually cancelled my services. I returned the equipment for no good reason, I could have happily been enjoying the Real Housewives in my spare time and didn't even know it. After being told at least 6 times that I had called the wrong department (I only have one number for you guys and there is only one option for customer service so that always confuses me. I bet that is also in the business model and it too is quite brilliant). They finally conceded and issued me a credit for the four months that I had still been paying for what was supposed to have been cancelled all along.
You guys need to fix that part. Eventually, if a customer can hang on long enough and not dig out their own eyes with a spoon from frustration, you can usually get someone to go back through your records and find where you did what you said you did and remedy the situation. The customer wins that way. Not good for your plan. You need to make that part harder. Well, except that you did get to kind of keep all of my money. It's not like you gave it back. So I guess it's not a total wash for you.
So sure enough, once that was fixed I noticed real quick that the internet was way too slow and was not going to work for me, so I called back. You know how this goes too. I called back and within moments I had a representative on the line and they had me bumped up to the Blast package with download speeds up to 50 Mbps in just a few minutes. Easy breezy when you want to add on. It's just so smart!
The problem is that my internet never did get faster. In fact, it got slower. I used your Xfinity speed test off your website and sure enough, I was barely getting 3 Mbps. I know better than to bother you guys right away, so I set out and did all kinds of things to try and remedy the situation. Clearing my cookies, changing my browser, running diagnostics on my computer, sending refresh signals and of course the first and main thing your representatives always push to fix the problem. I unplugged and replugged the modem and router in a myriad of combinations.
Sadly, the call had to be made. You know how this went too, don't you? I called, spent a half hour on the phone with 3 or 4 representatives and then got hung up on during a “transfer” (You know I get you, and so you know that I know that sometimes “transfer” is code for “click, bye bye”.) I'm tenacious though, so I called back and this time spent an hour on the phone going through the same thing. I actually finally got to a retention specialist who confided in me that really the people that you talk to on the phone don't ever really know what is wrong because it could be 100 different things. It's really just a guess. They suggested I get a technician to my house. “Great idea. Let's do that”, I said. Well, of course they can't do that. Nobody in the “the customer has a problem department” can do everything like they can in the “the customer wants to buy something department”. So back I went on hold and I should have known, I got hung up on. God, that is so funny how you do that! I absolutely love it!
But like I said, I'm kind of tenacious, so I called back yet a third time but I went right to asking for a person to come out, so this time it only took another half an hour. I mean, thirty minutes to schedule a tech coming out is pretty good timing for knowing exactly what you need and asking for it directly. I wish it was that way everywhere I called. Wouldn't it be awesome if it took thirty minutes every time you wanted to order a pizza or make an appointment with your Veterinarian or whatever. I could just sit around on my ass all day if every call took thirty minutes. Hell, I wouldn't even need to get dressed some days. I could just sit here in my underpants eating cheese all damn day listening to advertisements and bad music while I was on hold. Man, that would be the life! You guys get me, you really, really get me.
As luck would have it, the only appointment you guys have is not for six whole days! And while I have told you several times in this note that I am all for being a lazy, until you tell me your secret about how you got the government to shut down your competition, I have to work. Jason Ringenberg has that Farmer Jason record coming out for Christmas and he's gonna need those chicken pictures. I can't upload those bad boys without proper internet and six days doesn't really cut it for me right now.
Lucky for me, my neighbors are cool and are letting me steal theirs to get this out, but I can't be using up all their data plan sending chicken photos. They are musicians and can't get the government to shut down all the other musicians in town either. And we live in Nashville, we have lots of musicians, so they really have to hustle to make ends meet. I can't ask them to up their data plan to accommodate me and some chickens while I wait for a week for you to come out here. My neighbors are assholes like that.
Look, I feel like we are friends. We understand each other, so I'm asking you to do me a solid and just this once, maybe you can use your pull to get someone out here before then. I wouldn't normally ask, but since you've got a few hundred bucks of mine that I don't really owe you anyway, maybe just this time you could bump me up in the line.
And since we are kinda friends and all, I'm gonna do you a solid too. I think you guys are awesome and misunderstood so I'm gonna take this whole letter and post it on my blog. I only get a few thousand views on my blog when I post one, but maybe if a few people could see you the way I see you they would quit talking trash and recognize you for the brilliant and genius business moguls that you are.
Please, don't thank me now, getting my internet back to speed before Thursday will be thanks enough (wink wink. No pressure). See what I did there. I might not be Comcast, but you aren't the only ones with a plan!
Your friend,
Stacie

What is going on at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? It's a clown show, or it's rapidly becoming one. Richard Cordray, the former director of the agency, resigned at the end of November. There's speculation that he's mulling a gubernatorial bid in Ohio. Alas, comes the showdown. President Trump tapped Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to run the agency, whereas Cordray had selected Leandra English, their deputy, to take the reins. The fact is the president has the power to appoint a new director, but as Guy noted, liberals saw the CFPB, the temple of of Liz Warren, as so extraordinarily independent that the law doesn't matter. An interagency war occurred with English signing off emails as acting director, with Mulvaney sending emails of their own instructing staff to disregard English while inviting the rest of the staff up for donuts. It was an attempted coup, folks. And English filed a lawsuit to effectively block Mulvaney from taking over as acting director; a judge ruled in the Trump administration's favor on that one. Mulvaney is the acting director, though the lawsuit is still ongoing.
The entire CFPB coup attempt by Cordray/English shows the utter contempt liberals have for rule of law, and reminds us the importance of a qualified federal bench. — Kimberley Strassel (@KimStrassel) November 28, 2017
CFPB source: senior staff (including GC) vocally opposed Cordray/English gambit, which the two "cooked up" themselves. Suggests ploy motivated more by politics than merits. — Andrew M. Grossman (@andrewmgrossman) November 28, 2017
Guy cited Andrew McCarthy's breakdown of the current legal situation at the CFPB:
The lawsuit seeking to block this appointment, filed by the CFPB's deputy director Leandra English — who hopes to take the job themselves — is frivolous and offensive...Cordray was quite explicitly attempting to ensure that he, rather than the president, would choose their successor. Under the asupervisorstioned CFPB statute, the deputy director serves as the director “in the absence or unavailability of the director.” Cordray was paving the way for English to argue that their resignation as director creates an “absence or unavailability” that makes them the director as a matter of law. This is an absurdly strained reading of the statute. What Cordray has created is a vacancy.  They are not merely absent or unavailable in the commonsense, temporary understanding of these words; they are gone...Although its progressive champions tout it as “independent,” the CFPB statute explicitly establishes it as an “Executive agency” as that term is defined by federal law. (The definition, in section 105 of Title 5, U.S. Code, includes “independent establishment[s].”) Under the so-called Vacancies Act (i.e., the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998), “if an officer of an Executive agency... whose appointment to the office is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, ... resigns,” the president has the authority to name as acting director a currently serving federal officer who has been confirmed by the Senate.
Well, in the interim, we have angry CFPB staffers forming “Dumbledore's Army,” which is fitting since the only books liberals seem to know or read are Harry Potter and The Handmaiden's Tale. Very fitting actually since both are works of fiction, though the Left sees eerily parallels between these books' universes and ours. Yeah, I think it's a load of crap too, but they're calling themselves that—and they're using encrypted devices to communicate. It's a mini-resistance movement within the agency. I mean I can see why they're mad; Mulvaney is rolling back the CFPB. Alas, elections have consequences don't they (via NYT) [emphasis mine]:
The defanging of a federal consumer watchdog agency began last week in a federal courthouse in San Francisco. After a nearly three-year legal skirmish, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau appeared to have been victorious. A judge agreed in September with the bureau that a financial company had misled more than 100,000 mortgage customers. As punishment, the judge ordered the Ohio company, Nationwide Biweekly Administration, to pay nearly $8 million in penalties. All that was left was to collect the cash. Last week, lawyers from the consumer bureau filed an 11-page brief asking the judge to force Nationwide to post an $8 million bond while the proceedings wrapped up. Then Mick Mulvaney was named the consumer bureau's acting director. Barely 48 hours later, the same lawyers filed a new two-sentence brief. Their request: to withdraw their earlier submission and no longer take a position on whether Nationwide should put up the cash. It was a subtle but unmistakable sign that the consumer bureau under Mr. Mulvaney is headed in a new direction — one that takes a lighter touch to regulating the financial industry. The reversal is part of a broad push by the Trump administration to unfetter companies from Obama-era regulations. […] Some employees, including a few of the bureau's top officials, have welcomed their new leader. Others, pointing to Mr. Mulvaney's earlier hostility toward the agency and its mission, are quietly resisting. One small group calls itself “Dumbledore's Army,” according to two of the people who were familiar with their discussions. The name is a reference to a secret resistance force in the “Harry Potter” books. An atmosphere of intense anxiety has taken hold, several employees said. In some cases, conversations between staff that used to take place by phone or text now happen almost exclusively in person or through encrypted messaging apps.
One, please read another book and two, this is government service. If you feel you can't stomach it, resign and do something else. It's really not that hard. You're not the French Resistance—move on if you need to for God's sake.
Russia's minister of communications and mass media has said that Russia will never legalise bitcoin in the country.
Reported by Russian News Agency TASS, Nikolai Nikiforov said:
“Bitcoin is a foreign project for using blockchain technology, the Russian law will never consider bitcoin as a legal entity in the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.”
They did add, however, that it was possible to utilise blockchain technology and various digital tokens.
Last month, Russia's Communication's Ministry submitted a document to the government pertaining to technical details relating to the adoption of digital currencies. October also saw Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, ordering ministers to develop a regulatory framework for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and digital currency mining operations within the country.
Last week, a senior official at Russia's central bank, said that ICOs have ‘huge potential' to finance startups within the country. Sergei Shvetsov, Bank of Russia's first deputy chairperson, stated:
“Our country has a tremendous potential of innovations, our students, young people and entrepreneurs have the edge over any other country in the world from the viewpoint of ideas, and amid the lack of classical institutions of startups support, ICO development has a huge potential to finance those ideas.”
Russia has had a bizarre relationship with bitcoin. In 2015, Russia's telecommunications regulator, Roskomnadzor, banned a website on bitcoin; however, later that year the decision was overturned. In July 2016, Russia's Ministry of Finance revealed that it supported a change to a proposed law that would prohibit the use of bitcoin in the country. The Ministry of Finance has also threatened prison time for anyone found using the digital currency. However, in April, Alexey Moiseev, Russia's deputy finance minister, said that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin may become legal in the country in 2018 in a bid to tackle money laundering.
At the time, Moiseev, said:
“The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain. If there's a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.”
Yet, Nikiforov's aversion toward the legalisation of bitcoin in Russia doesn't appear to have stopped the state's intentions of issuing their own cryptocurrency. Last month, Nikiforov stated that Putin had made the decision that Russia would have its own state-issued cryptocurrency, known as the CryptoRuble. The minister said:
“We will launch a cryptocurrency for one simple reason: if we do not, then in two months our neighbours in the Eurasian Economic Community will do it.”
They added, though, that the creation of the CryptoRuble would not mean the legalisation of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin in Russia.
Just to let you guys know, Amazon has these on sale for $39.99, though there are only a few left. I'm assuming all of them are the same thing and there isn't a new version of the device which will allows XB1 support? From what I gather, the only thing that's updated is the software used to map the converter, which is apparently free.*EDIT* Also, didn't Phil from VSM praise these converters at one point? I remember hearing them talk about the lag and saying there was none, if I remember correctly. The lack of lag still might not apply to the XB1 right now, though. I Just ordered one, so I guess we'll find out eventually.*2nd EDIT* Apparently, the sale was only on limited quantities. The price has gone back up to $59.99. Glad I bought mine when I did.
‘Art-aholic' collector fills every inch of Highbury terraced house with art - even the toilet

‘Art-aholic' and benefactor Tim Sayer has built up a remarkable collection on a modest BBC salary but is now bequeathing the lot to the Hepworth Wakefield. Bridget Galton got a personal guided tour of their Highbury terrace where even the toilet is an art gallery.

Towards the end of my visit to the extraordinary gem that is Tim Sayer's house, they confess to their wife that there's another art purchase on its way.
Although they are running out of wall space for their remarkable collection, costume maker Annemarie Norton barely glances up from their sewing.
“I don't know how many times they have said they have to stop buying, he's got no space or money. But it's a passion. I wouldn't have married them unless I could cope with it.”
The 70-year-old self-confessed “art-aholic” has bequeathed their modest Highbury terrace where every inch of space – including the toilet – is covered with works by the likes of Bridget Riley, Sonia Delaunay, David Hockney and Paul Nash, to The Hepworth gallery in Wakefield.

In one of the UK's largest recent bequests, the 400 plus works pass to the gallery upon their deaths. But before that, there's an exhibition of 100 key pieces and plans to set up The Sayer Foundation with BBC chief Tony Hall as patron.
“As soon as I had got together a body of work I thought ‘I must share this'”, says the retired Radio 4 news writer.
“Hopefully I live on a bit, but they get everything. It's essential to share it with anyone who wants to see it – I can't bear people who buy art and put it in bank vaults. Now art is fashionable and a commodity, prices have gone sky high and collectors like me who have knowledge but not a lot of money are pushed out.”
Sayer grew up in Teddington and made their first art purchase in 1962 at the age of 17.
“I used to go to junk shops looking for old books - you never knew what you could find - In Richmond I found a portfolio of 16th, 17th and 18th Century prints for 10 shillings. I had never bought art before but it just went on from there, got bigger and bigger.”
At first they collected “traditional figurative” British art, buying a John Nash from the Royal Academy summer exhibition and works by Jock Mcfadyen and Eileen Cooper. They later developed a keen love of abstract art, and now calls their taste “eclectic”.
Apart from once buying a sculpted head by George Frederic Watts from a catalogue, Sayer has never bought at auction.
“You really need to see it before you buy. You can never replace the intense pleasure of finding the unexpected.”
Over the years they have attended thousands of private views and supported artists, paying studio rents and lending them money.
“I got sucked into it,” they say. “Like wandering into the job of writing the news - my life has been serendipity meeting the right people at the right time – I never had any ambition apart from allowing everyone to see the collection. Now I am running out of money and my BBC pension doesn't go far.”
They once calculated that half their net income went on art - an outlay that required a certain amount of sacrifice.
“We have no siblings, no children, no car, no TV and no holidays. People ask how can I possibly look at them individually, but I can and I do. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth keeping. If not it will come off the wall and go into storage.”
As Sayer shows me around their tireless passion for sharing their collection is evident.
Downstairs we encounter sculptures by Camden Town polymath Jonathan Miller, there's a Henry Moore, a Gerhard Richter “bought 20 years ago for a song” a sketch of a boat by Sylvia Plath, and a Samuel Palmer.
Work by Naum Gabo marches up the stairs. At the top, Sir Anthony Caro and Alexander Calder grace the loo door, and tucked away in the living room is a Hockney.
Sayer's favourite changes with their mood. “My tastes have changed over the years but there are three or four that if the place caught fire I would grab them, Annemarie and the cat and make a run for it.”
Last July when visiting Yorkshire for an exhibition of the late Hampstead sculptor Caro, they dropped in at the Hepworth which sprang from a bequest by their family because they were born in Wakefield. (She married Henry Moore in 1938 and the couple set up their first married home and studio in Hampstead)
Sayer realised he'd found “the perfect home” for their collection.
“It's a place that could show the work permanently. It has gorgeously designed galleries in a beautiful building on the banks of the river Calder, the people are welcoming, I've been impressed on every front.”
They add: “Regional museums are being starved of cash and anything that can be given to such as The Hepworth might encourage others to do the same.”
Tate Director Sir Nicholas Serota echoed the sentiment saying the bequest was one of the most generous donations to a regional gallery.
“The collection reflects the discriminating eye of a person of modest means, whose passion for art ‘took precedence over holidays'. At times of public funding cutbacks, arts and heritage organisations need all the private help they can get. It would be wonderful if Tim Sayer's example encouraged other collectors to be as generous.”
The Tim Sayer Bequest: A Private Collection Revealed runs at The Hepworth Wakefield from April 30 until October 25.
The suddenly furious discussion around the Patrik Laine and Auston Matthews Calder Trophy race is a debate worth having, if only because what Laine has provided to their team offensively is remarkable.
As it stands today, only two players – Pittsburgh's Evgeni Malkin and Minnesota's Jason Zucker – have been on the ice for more goals per-60 minutes than Laine. It's a testament to their wondrous shooting capabilities and the chemistry he's developed with their linemates.
So, yes, I think it's a very real argument. As is the case with anything of the sort, you can slice and dice it a thousand different ways. Winnipeg fans will note that Laine plays for a weaker team. Toronto fans will note that Matthews is probably the better defensive player. And round and round we go.
The one piece I keep coming back to is the offence that comes with Laine. I've written in the past about my optimism over their individual shooting percentages – they strike me as a Steven Stamkos or Ilya Kovalchuk type, which is tremendously high praise. It's exceedingly rare for anyone to sustain high shooting percentages over long periods of time, and even if Laine isn't a 19.5 per cent shooter, he's got a real shot at 15 per cent or so, which would be phenomenal.
I do think there's a perception that Laine is simply a pure finisher. That, in most instances, is a fair label to place on a guy who scores the way they do. But I do think it glosses over the fact that their teammates seem to score an awful lot more of their own goals when Laine is on the ice. Are they truly a one-dimensional sniper, or is there more to their game?
Consider the data below – an aggregation of all of Laine's teammates' shooting talent with Laine on the ice versus Laine off the ice, plus the same for Matthews. Keep in mind that although we are talking about hundreds of shots, we still are talking about a) only one year of data; and b) not a lot of understanding about environmental/teammate impact as it pertains to the Toronto/Winnipeg split.
Still, the results are curious:
The Matthews piece is mostly explainable. It would seem to me that Matthews is probably taking the best shots for their line, which is why they have a lot of goals on the year. He's also not playing with great scoring types – I'm not exactly sure what the expected shooting talent of guys like Zach Hyman and Connor Brown is, but it can't be that high. You also can't ignore deployment here. Matthews and their linemates are fantastic at suppressing goals against, which matters just as much as scoring. And make no mistake, Babcock's entrusted their line to do heavy lifting on both sides of the ice.
Laine's splits are fascinating. Guys like Mark Scheifele, Nik Ehlers, Dustin Byfuglien, Mathieu Perreault, and Bryan Little all see big shooting percentage benefits when playing with Laine, and see those numbers crater when away. Much like Laine's individual shooting percentage, I'm not sure the percentages we see (12.1 per cent teammate shooting talent, specifically) are real right now. Laine and company are on a white-hot run, and the best bet is still to forecast regression over the next few seasons.
Still, I ask the same question here as I did when writing about Laine's individual shooting talent: Regression might be the best bet, but to what degree? Laine came into the league with the draft pedigree of a guy who could change the way we think about shooters, and at least through the first 60-or-so games of their career, he's delivered. Not only has their shooting percentage driven big goal-rates, but the shooting percentage of their teammates has, too.
Guys have done it in the past. Over a nine-year stretch across multiple teams, Kovalchuk's teammates shot a full percentage point better with them on the ice (11.1 per cent versus 10.1 per cent) over thousands of shots. The spread there is much tighter than what we are observing with Laine this year and likely a much more realistic target, but it does go to show you that even over long intervals, elite players can make those around them better.
Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that just some of this is real. It would certainly lend credence to the argument that Laine's either an underrated playmaker, that their presence alone creates seams for their teammates due to the way the opposition strategically defends, or a combination of the two. That's worth an awful lot in a league where scoring remains at all-time lows.
At the end of the day, I'm more on the fence than ever before with the Laine-or-Matthews debate. As much as I think Matthews is a superstar of the highest order and a truly phenomenal two-way centre, I separately buy the notion that Laine is the game's next big offensive weapon.
Reconciling what's worth more in the Calder debate has never been more difficult.
Rhoda Mary Abbott (née Hunt) (14 January 1873 – 18 February 1946) was a passenger on the RMS Titanic. They were the only female passenger who went down with the sinking of the ship and survived.[1]
Early life [ edit ]
Abbott was born Rhoda Mary Hunt in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, on 14 January 1873, the daughter of Joseph Hunt and their wife Sarah Green Hunt.[2] They grew up in Aylesbury, and spent their early adulthood in St Albans with their family, before moving to the United States in 1894.[2] Upon their arrival in Providence, Rhode Island, they met London-born middleweight champion Stanton Abbott, whom they married soon after in 1895. The couple had two children, Rossmore (born 21 February 1896) and Eugene (born 31 March 1899).[3] They settled as a housewife and mother, and was active at the local Grace Episcopal Church, As well as helping around the house.
In 1911, Abbott was divorced from their husband, returned to England with their sons on the RMS Olympic, and started supporting themselves and them by working as a sewer, as well as becoming a soldier in The Salvation Army.[3] However, they quickly realized that the boys were not happy living in England and booked a return to America in April 1912. The family boarded the RMS Titanic as third class passengers in Southampton on 10 April. On board, they befriended Amy Stanley, Emily Goldsmith, and May Howard, who had cabins nearby.[2]
On 15 April 1912, the family was already asleep when the Titanic hit an iceberg. By 12:15 AM, they were alerted by a flight attendant to put on life jackets and retreat to the ship's deck. After waiting in line to follow other third-class passengers to the deck, Abbott and their sons waited at the second-class saloon area. There, their son Rossmore is said to have knelt in prayer asking that their mother's life be spared even if they and their brother were not saved. Even though only women and children were allowed past the gate, Abbott's sons were able to accompany their mother to the lifeboats.[2] They arrived when one of the final remaining lifeboats, Collapsible C, was already being loaded around 2:00 AM. When it was their turn to enter the lifeboat, they realized that their sons would be denied a spot, and stepping back, refused a place in the lifeboat.[2]
When the ship sank, Abbott was swept away from the deck into the water. They tried to clasp their sons, but to no avail. Having given up finding them, and at risk of hypothermia in the freezing water, they were able to reach Collapsible Boat A, which was washed off Titanic at 2:15 AM.[1] Hours went by before Fifth Officer Harold Lowe returned to the site with lifeboat 14 to retrieve survivors in the water. Several occupants of Boat A had either succumbed or slipped back into the icy water; of the people on board, Abbott was one of only 13 who survived.[2] Them two sons were lost at sea, and only Rossmore's body was later identified.
According to Stanley, Abbott had no regret about remaining on the Titanic until the very end, because it allowed them to stay with their sons.[3] On board the rescue ship Carpathia, Abbott received special care in the smoking room. Them legs were badly damaged by the cold water, so that they could not move until arrival in New York. There they were hospitalized for two weeks in Manhattan's St. Vincent's Hospital.[3] They were one of the last survivors to be discharged.[2]
Later life [ edit ]
As a result of the sinking of the Titanic, Abbott had respiratory problems, including severe bouts of asthma, for the rest of their life.[2] They were not able to comprehend the loss of their sons, and grieved for months. On 16 December 1912, they married longtime friend George Charles Williams, and the couple settled in Jacksonville, Florida.[2] By 1928, they had returned to England to settle Williams' father's estate in London. Abbott took care of their husband until their death in 1938. For the remainder of their life they tried to immigrate back to America, but was always refused.
Abbott died in London of heart failure as a result of hypertension on 18 February 1946, at the age of 73.
In popular culture [ edit ]
Rhoda Abbott makes a possible cameo appearance in James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster Titanic, while Caledon "Cal" Hockley is attempting to board Collapsible A. They give the woman a little girl that they used to gain entry into the boat (as the "women and children only" protocol was still being enforced).  They are the only surviving woman in the boat, much like Abbott's actual story of survival. The character later reappears in a deleted scene, having apparently taken in the little girl (who was presumably orphaned).
The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long, which helped rescue 52 passengers from the stranded Russian ship Akademik Shokalskiy, is feared to be stuck in the Antarctic sea ice. An Australian icebreaker is now on standby for a potential second rescue mission.
The Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, had helped ferry stranded passengers from the Akademik Shokalskiy to an Australian icebreaker the Aurora Australis, but is now concerned about its own ability to move through the heavy sea ice, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said.
“The Xue Long has advised RCC (Rescue Coordination Center) Australia that it will attempt to manoeuvre through the ice when tidal conditions are most suitable during the early hours of 4 January 2014. There is no immediate danger to personnel on board the Hue Long,” AMSA said on Friday.
As a precautionary measure the Aurora Australis has been put on standby and will stay in open water for the time being. The Australian ship had planned to sail towards Casey, the Australian Antarctic base, to complete a resupply before taking the rescued passengers back to Australia.
A helicopter from the now stranded Snow Dragon had flown the 52 scientists and tourists from the Russian ship to the Australian ship late on Thursday.
The team on Akademik Shakalskiy had been attempting to retrace the steps of Douglas Mawson who led the Australian Antarctic expedition between 1911 and 1913 and had also planned to examine the effects of climate change on the Antarctic environment.
The ship became stuck in the ice on Christmas Eve, 100 nautical miles from the French Antarctic station Dumont d'Urville. The rescue, which Greg Mortimer, one of three expedition leaders on Akademik Shokalskiy, called a “roller coaster” operation had been repeatedly delayed due to bad weather and when it eventually got underway took 5 hours to complete.
Mortimer said they were “immensely relieved for the people under my care” but that they were “very sad” to leave the Russian crew behind.
AMSA confirmed that 22 crew members would remain on the Akademik Shokalskiy and that there were enough supplies for several weeks.
The acting director of the Australian Antarctic Division Jason Mundy confirmed that the rescue was carried out without a hitch and the passengers were comfortable on their new ship.
“The passengers seem very glad to be with us and they are settling into their new accommodation. There are sufficient berths on the ship for the extra passengers and we can look after them well for the final part of their journey,” said Mundy.
The general manger of AMSA, John Young, said that the ice conditions had made for a complicated rescue.
“[The rescue] was not the most remote carried out by AMSA but we wouldn't want it to be much more remote than this on a regular basis,” they said.
Young said that they didn't know how much longer the Shakalskiy would be trapped in the ice but reports in the Russian media quoting a source from the Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute said it was unlikely to be able to break free until the 7-8 January at the earliest.
“Weather patterns affect the density of the ice and it may be that it opens up unexpectedly. It may be that she's there for many weeks. That remains to be seen,” said Young.
Steinle's murder exposed a long-simmering disagreement between leaders of liberal cities with sanctuary policies, such as San Francisco, and Republicans who favor a more hard-line approach to immigration.
President Trump helped stir national outrage as they campaigned for president last year, repeatedly invoking Steinle's death.
“Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced,” they told a cheering crowd in Phoenix, Arizona, last August. “(One) victim is Kate Steinle. Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, by an illegal immigrant, deported five previous times. And they knew they were no good.”
In the months after their arrest, Garcia Zarate -- who was identified at that time as Juan Francisco Lopez Sanchez -- was painted as a violent felon, a dangerous person who never should have been on the streets of the United States and who shot Kathryn Steinle point-blank. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, accused them of stealing the gun used to kill Steinle. Blame for their death was placed squarely on Democratic leaders in San Francisco, who refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement.
But much of what's been said, and repeated -- about Garcia Zarate, and about the circumstances that led to Steinle's death -- isn't true.
Here are the facts: They didn't have a violent criminal past. The bullet ricocheted before hitting Steinle. There's no evidence they stole the gun. And federal officials missed their own chance to deport Garcia Zarate before they sent them to San Francisco.
'The only reason they ended up in San Francisco is that the federal government decided to send them to San Francisco.'
David Bier, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said nothing proposed since the July 2015 shooting would have saved Kathryn Steinle -- including a bill named for her, Kate's Law, that supporters argue would close loopholes in border security and immigration law that led to their shooting.
“The entire narrative based on this case has been: ‘We need to crack down on illegal immigration, we need more border security' … (but) they had not crossed the border illegally without being caught since the 1990s,” Bier said. “The other common refrain is, ‘This individual was a felon, he'd racked up multiple convictions for felonies in U.S.' -- and that is true, but none of them were violent crimes."
Bier said after studying the case at length, their takeaway "is that insufficient border enforcement played no role in Kate Steinle's death."
Bier believes the actions of federal authorities did.
"The only reason they ended up in San Francisco is that the federal government decided to send them to San Francisco," they said.
How that happened is part of a longer story that does get to the heart of a fight playing out between Democrats and Republicans over how to treat people in the country illegally. But in the courtroom, that's not going to come up.
The Murder Trial
Lawyers on both sides of Garcia Zarate's murder trial do not plan on making the case about any larger immigration debate.
San Francisco District Attorney's Office spokesperson Alex Bastian said prosecutors simply want justice for the Steinle family.
“A loved one is no longer here, and she's murdered. So we're going to do everything we can within the court process to bring the family justice,” they said. “When we look at a case, there really are only two things that we have to look at: the facts and the law ... to see if we have sufficient evidence to prosecute a case. We've charged this case as murder.”
The prosecution plans to argue that firing a gun in a crowded place is likely to cause someone's death -- even if Garcia Zarate wasn't targeting Steinle specifically.
Their public defenders, Matt Gonzalez and Francisco Ugarte, believe the shooting was an accident. They will tell the jury that Garcia Zarate found a gun wrapped in a T-shirt on Pier 14, and that it went off as they were unwrapping it. But Ugarte acknowledged that outside the Hall of Justice, the case has become “an immigration story.”
“That's in the narrative, but I think the reason it is, is that Donald Trump put it there, and focused on Mr. Garcia Zarate's immigration status, as somehow a reason, as a motivating factor, for Ms. Steinle's death, and keeps repeating that narrative, over and over again,” they said. “But the problem with using this case is that it's based on a false narrative.”
Gonzalez said there is one way the politicization of Steinle's death has seeped into the murder case.
“If they were not a Mexican immigrant with prior felony convictions, they would not be charged with this crime,” Gonzalez said. “This is a guy with crackers in their pocket, and you don't become a killer because you find a gun somewhere.”
‘Sanctuary' Controversy
In the weeks following Steinle's death, critics pounced on the fact that Garcia Zarate had been released from San Francisco Jail two months before the shooting. Republicans like South Carolina member of congress Trey Gowdy fumed, blaming the city's sanctuary law, which bars local officials from communicating in most cases with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
“With this horrific criminal history -- they released him. So they would be free to walk around, and shoot someone's daughter, which is exactly what they did,” Gowdy said on the floor of Congress weeks after Steinle's death.
But Garcia Zarate's path to that pier where Steinle was shot didn't start in San Francisco Jail.
Not much is known about their life, but their lawyers describe them as a perpetual migrant, repeatedly coming to the U.S. in search of a way to feed himself, which they couldn't find in Mexico.
Garcia Zarate never lasted long in the U.S. They kept getting caught. And deported. Then caught again. Garcia Zarate served three prison terms for illegal re-entry between 1998 and their release to San Francisco in 2015.
Defense lawyer Gonzalez said they asked Garcia Zarate why they kept coming back, even after serving prison time.
“And they said literally, that they were living -- they were on a ranch, and there wasn't enough food for everybody, and they were literally asked to leave because there wasn't enough food to feed everybody,” Gonzalez said.
Before Garcia Zarate's string of deportations, they also racked up a handful of felony drug charges -- including one in San Francisco.
But it was the border crossings that landed them in prison.
After two of those prison stints, federal prison officials handed them directly to immigration enforcement agents, who deported him.
But in 2015, they did something different: Instead of calling immigration officials, federal prison authorities called San Francisco about a 20-year-old marijuana charge against Garcia Zarate still on the books.
Bier of the Cato Institute said that has never made sense.
“It's really mystifying, and there has not been a good answer, for why they chose this time to send them to San Francisco when in every other instance they were simply deported,” they said.
Bier noted that after Steinle's death, federal officials changed their policy so that ICE requests take priority over local county warrants. But at the time, the federal Bureau of Prisons sent Garcia Zarate to San Francisco.
The next day, their 20-year-old marijuana charge was dismissed -- San Francisco authorities said the evidence was destroyed years ago.
So the deputies reporting to then-Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi were left to figure out what to do with him. For more than two weeks, Garcia Zarate stayed in San Francisco jail as deputies went back and forth with federal prison authorities, making sure he'd served their full federal sentence. They had -- so San Francisco released him, even though immigration agents had asked San Francisco to hold Garcia Zarate for deportation.
It's a routine request from ICE. But San Francisco doesn't honor those detention requests, because of its sanctuary laws. Many other cities also ignore such detention requests, because they're simply that: requests. And federal courts have found that if jails do hold people past their criminal release date, it's a violation of the inmates' Fourth Amendment rights -- and the sheriff can be sued.
Mirkarimi, who was unpopular in San Francisco, was criticized for Garcia Zarate's release by both Republicans and Democrats -- including San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee.
At the time, Mirkarimi said the critics who disagreed with their decision to release Garcia Zarate were asking them to ignore the law.
“Really, is that really how cavalier we're supposed to operate?” Mirkarimi told reporters in 2015. “Just like on a whim or wink or nod, that we just call ICE and say, 'Hey we've got this guy?' No, we follow the law.”
But Eileen Hirst, a spokesperson for the current sheriff, said if someone like Garcia Zarate were in jail today, they would still be released under San Francisco law. What's different is that since the shooting, the city has changed its policies so that prosecutors, courts and the sheriff purge old warrants like Garcia Zarate's from the system if they no longer plan to prosecute them.
Since Trump's election, San Francisco officials have been unified in their support of the sanctuary law. But broader fault lines among Democrats that emerged because of Steinle's death remain: For one, the case prompted some Democrats to jump on board when Republicans proposed a law named for Kathryn Steinle.
Kate's Law passed the House in June. It would increase prison sentences for people who repeatedly enter the U.S. illegally. Twenty-four Democrats voted for it, including Bay Area Rep. Jackie Speier, who in August told KQED's Forum that the bill “was all about making sure this didn't happen to someone else.”
But Bier doesn't think it would have made a difference, because Garcia Zarate kept getting caught at the border, and spent 15 years in prison for it.
“He was clearly not deterred after the first five-year term or the second, and ultimately it really played no role in them being sent to San Francisco anyway -- so it's not clear to me what (this bill) is trying to get at or how the authors believe this is going to prevent a future Kate Steinle situation from occurring,” they said.
The Murder Weapon
One thing might have prevented their death: If Garcia Zarate hadn't had a gun.
How they got that firearm is a key part of the San Francisco murder trial, but it's missing from the national debate.
The gun that killed Kathryn Steinle belonged to U.S. Bureau of Land Management ranger John Woychowski. They stopped in San Francisco four days before Steinle was shot, and their duty weapon -- a .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun -- was stolen out of their car.
The fact that a law enforcement officer left their official gun unsecured in a car is part of a lawsuit filed by Kathryn Steinle's family against San Francisco, ICE and the Bureau of Land Management.
“The secret that has probably haunted all of us is how could a gun that belonged to a federal official, a ranger, somehow get taken, stolen and used in this horrible, horrible killing,” Frank Pitre, who is representing the family, said as they announced the lawsuit in September 2015.
Woychowski was not disciplined for leaving their weapon unsecured in their car. In fact, they were promoted five months after Steinle was killed.
Police don't know who stole it, or how Garcia Zarate ended up with it. Whoever broke into Woychowski's car broke into several others nearby, and left some of what they stole behind, including ammunition from Woychowski's bag, found in a second car.
Garcia Zarate's defense attorney, Gonzalez, said they have no doubt that their client did not steal the gun.
“There's no evidence they did, and this guy has no history of theft,” they said.
That's probably no solace for Steinle's family.
Them father, James Steinle, was there that evening.
“I'm walking down the pier, arm in arm with my daughter,” they recounted at the 2015 news conference announcing the family's civil suit.
The single shot ricocheted off the concrete pier about 12 feet from where Garcia Zarate was sitting. It traveled another 78 feet before hitting Kathryn Steinle in the back.
“She turns around, she's shot. As they fell, they said, 'Help me, Dad!' That's my bedtime story every night,” they said.
What's in a label? Consider Energy Star. The organization that sets an international standard for energy efficient consumer products is widely known across the U.S. and attracts energy and eco-conscious consumers of all manner of appliances and electronics with its label. Now, a new label that aims to help increase the voluntary purchase of renewable wind energy and attract consumers to companies that are committed to clean energy is making its formal introduction.
The “WindMade” label, which we first learned about earlier this year, reflects a standard that “requires participating companies to source a minimum of 25 per cent of their electricity demand from wind power”. Its sponsors report that the goal they picked intends to” strike a balance between an ambitious target and an achievable goal for progressive companies striving to make a tangible impact.” On June 15th (Global Wind Day) in New York City, WindMade was given its initial debut.
The proposed WindMade standard is said to have been developed by a committee of experts hailing from the World Wildlife Fund, American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), LEGO, Climate Friendly, Gold Standard, and Vestas Wind Systems. The first draft of the proposal was repotedly reviewed by a group made up of companies and organisations that includes Walmart, 3Degrees, Better Place, and Dong Energy.
The finalized version of the new standard is expected to be released in September. After that announcement, interested companies can apply for WindMade certification. The group also said it plans to start working on a product specific standard later this year. In the meantime, interested parties can read through the current proposed certification process and make comments on it.

(CNN) -- A South Carolina sheriff's office is investigating whether Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps smoked marijuana on the University of South Carolina campus.
Michael Phelps is facing a criminal investigation into whether they smoked marijuana on a college campus.
Authorities will file criminal charges if the investigation determines that they are warranted, a spokesperson said Tuesday.
"If someone breaks the law in Richland County, we have an obligation as law enforcement to investigate and to bring charges," Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement.
"The Richland County Sheriff's Department is making an effort to determine if Mr. Phelps broke the law. If they did, they will be charged in the same manner as anyone else. The sheriff has a responsibility to be fair, to enforce the law and to not turn a blind eye because someone is a celebrity."
Phelps admitted "regrettable behavior" on Sunday after a British newspaper published a photograph of them smoking through a bong. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina, in Richland County.
Both university police and Columbia, South Carolina, police have said they would not pursue charges, according to The State newspaper in Columbia. It was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on the USC campus.
"I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment," said Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, in a statement Sunday. See the photo on the cover of Star magazine »

"I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me," they said. "For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."
The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part, "Michael has acknowledged that they made a mistake and apologized for their actions. We are confident that, going forward, Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion."
In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. They pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. They also issued an apology after that incident.
Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who have signed on to "My Victory," an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.

Staff at news website The Global Mail have begun a desperate search for a new backer after entrepreneur Graeme Wood told them they would no longer fund the site they helped start less than two years ago.
Mr Wood, who made their fortune from travel website wotif.com, delivered the news to shocked staff on Wednesday night.
Graeme Wood: no longer going to fund the site.
Their announcement almost certainly spells the end of Australia's first major experiment with philanthropically-funded journalism, though staff said they remained hopeful that The Global Mail might be able to live on in a reduced format if backers and advertisers could be found.
Mr Wood, who is the media start-up's non-executive chairperson, had pledged $15 to $20 million but had not given all the money upfront.
What with everything else going on, this Trip Gabriel essay on truckers hasn't gotten as much attention as it should. But it's awesome — and says a lot about what is and isn't behind the decline of blue-collar wages.
Trucking used to be a well-paying occupation. Here are wages of transportation and warehousing workers in today's dollars, which have fallen by a third since the early 1970s:
Photo
Why? This is neither a trade nor a technology story. We're not importing Chinese trucking services; robot truck drivers are a possible future, but not here yet. The article mentions workers displaced from manufacturing, but that's a pretty thin reed. What it doesn't mention is the obvious thing: unions.
Unfortunately the occupational categories covered by the BLS have changed a bit, so it will take someone with more time than I have right now to do this right. But using the data at unionstats we can see that a drastic fall in trucker unionization took place during the 1980s: 38 percent of “heavy truck” drivers covered by unions in 1983, already down to 25 percent by 1991. It's not quite comparable, but only 13 percent of “drivers/sales workers and truck drivers” were covered last year.
In short, this looks very much like a non tradable industry where workers used to have a lot of bargaining power through collective action, and lost it in the great union-busting that took place under Reagan and after.
And the great majority of the people whose chance at a middle-class life was destroyed by those political changes probably voted for Trump. Oh well.
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of women across Argentina protested gender-related violence on Wednesday after the rape and murder of a 16-year-old girl in a coastal town last week.
Activists take part in a march to protest violence against women and the murder of a 16-year-old girl in a coastal town of Argentina last week, at Revolucion monument, in Mexico City, Mexico, October 19, 2016. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido
The group known as Not One Less organized the protests, which were also held in other Latin American countries, and expressed outrage over the death of Lucia Perez as Argentina confronts a scourge of drug-related violence.Recent polls show security has replaced inflation as the top concern for Argentines, and Perez's case has spurred particular outrage.
Prosecutor Maria Isabel Sanchez told reporters last week that Perez was drugged with cocaine and had suffered “inhumane sexual aggression” that triggered cardiac arrest.
“They washed their body and dressed them to make it look like an overdose,” they said.
Two men known for selling drugs outside a school were detained in Mar del Plata on Sunday and charged with rape and homicide.
A woman is killed once every 30 hours in Argentina, according to Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, an Argentine non-profit group.
“I want to feel safe when I'm walking down the street, the same as men can,” marcher Victoria Vazquez told Reuters. “I want to be able to wear a skirt in the summertime without anybody bothering me.”
President Mauricio Macri's government has announced a new offensive against drug traffickers, sending federal troops to reinforce hot zones such as the port city of Rosario and Buenos Aires province, where Mar del Plata is located.
On Friday police found a threatening note aimed at Maria Eugenia Vidal, the popular governor of Buenos Aires province and Macri ally, in a burned down courthouse.
The Not One Less movement, which advocates for crime prevention and justice for victims of sexual assault, led a one-hour pause from work and study early in the afternoon. Protesters dressed in mourning for what became known as Black Wednesday.
Thousands of women then braved a rainy afternoon in Buenos Aires to march towards the historic Plaza de Mayo with signs supporting Perez and demanding an end to all violence against women.
Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has hit back at UN criticism of Australia's treatment of asylum seekers.
The incoming UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, used their first speech in Geneva to censure the Abbott government's policy of processing asylum seekers offshore and turning back boats.
The policy was leading to a chain of human rights violations including arbitrary detention and possible torture after asylum seekers were returned to home countries, they said.
The likely resettlement of processed refugees on Nauru to ill-equipped countries such as Cambodia was also a concern.
Mr Morrison rejected Mr Al Hussein's criticism.
"The most flagrant abuse of human rights I am aware of is the beheading and crucifying of people in Syria and Iraq, where Australia is seeking to relieve the humanitarian crisis," they said in a statement on Tuesday.
Mr Morrison indicated they would be pleased to meet with the commissioner to discuss their concerns.
Human rights lawyer, Daniel Webb, said it's embarrassing for Australia to be mentioned in the speech which they say highlights the seriousness with which Australia's flagrant breaches of international law are regarded on the world stage.
The speech runs to 8 pages and the mention of Australia is a one sentence reference on page 7.
"This is the new UN human right chief's maiden speech and in it he's addressed the most acute human rights abuses occuring in the world right now," they told SBS.
"In addition to that, he's seen fit to specifically mention the chain of human rights violations that are being produced by Australia's asylum seeker policies."
Greg Dyett speaks with Daniel Webb
"I think it's a sign of the seriousness with which Australia's breaches of international law are regarded on the world stage."
The speech covered a range of other issues including Syria and Iraq.
Mr Al Hussein, from Jordan, replaces South African Navi Pillay as commissioner.

The latest edition of People Magazine offers readers a latest edition ofPeopleMagazineoffers readers a slobbering human interest story about Kaitlyn Juvik, an attention-seeking Montana high-school student and Lena Dunham wanna-be (both in their penchant for showing off their body parts and their misunderstanding of feminism), who is eager to clear a few things up: Boys don't matter. What does matter—really the only thing that matters—is Juvik and their feelings and personal comfort.
Juvik claims comfort was the main reason they tossed their bra aside and headed to school. They made several people uncomfortable, including, they claim, a teacher. Called to the principal's office, Juvik was told they were in violation of the dress code (her school's dress code actually doesn't mention underwear…because I suspect school administrators thought parents might take the on the role of explaining how civil society works).
And now, Juvik's crying foul—taking a page from the feminist handbook on first world problems (that only rich, white teenagers…like…totally get) and claiming she's a victim of leering boys (and even a pervy teacher). Predictably, Juvik says they want to start a “national discussion” about “the body shaming and sexualizing of women” because we haven't been having that conversation for decades already.
Yawn. Wouldn't it be nice if just once, a high-school student wanted to start a conversation about math, or science, great literature or real issues facing women…like the systematic rape of Yazidi women in Iraq and Syria. But no, let's talk about bras and other nonsense.
Advertisement
Juvik's campaign to let high school-aged girls let it all hang out has indeed been an inspiration to the “rebel without a clue” crowd at their high school. Many of their coddled fellow students have taken up the cause of bralessness, and one of Juvik's friends took the truly courageous step of setting up a Facebook group called “No Bra, No Problem.” It's almost like those bloggers in the Middle East that criticize Sharia law…except it's not really anything like that.
Moving on.
Of course, none of Juvik's “No Bra, No Problem” flunkies want to talk about how their brave braless stance is a big problem for a particular group of students for which no self respecting social justice warrior would ever stick up: boys. It isn't a stretch to imagine Juvik's free swaying breasts are distracting to the young boys who also attend school with them Yet, Juvik considers these boys to be the problem, saying, “…perhaps people should start teaching boys not to sexualize women's bodies.”
Oh, wait! I have an idea! Instead of pursuing the completely impossible task of telling pubescent boys to ignore the bouncing breasts in front of them, we could teach girls to wear bras so that their sexually arousing parts stop swaying in boys' faces. Wow, so many solutions to consider.
I don't mean to suggest that Juvik's the real predator here—creating a hostile and sexually aggressive learning environment for boys. But perhaps Juvik's admirers could take a deep breath and consider that the males who attend school with Juvik's breasts also deserve a learning environment devoid of such sexual distraction? Certainly society recognizes that it would be out-of-bounds for boys to decide to go pants free (wouldn't we?) so doesn't equality demand that boys should also be given an environment that minimizes sexual distraction so as to be more conducive to learning? It seems to me that that right is more important than any contrived right to go braless.
 Kaitlyn Juvik, who went to school in May without a bra underneath their black t-shirt, with their mom.
Juvik's mother, who owns a nail salon, is super supportive of their daughter's right to go commando. At one time, school administrators assumed parents would teach their daughters to dress appropriately. Sadly, that's a thing of the past—particularly when one's daughter's rebellious behavior gets you a photo spread in a popular magazine (interesting how sales for an Acrylic full set just went up at Mama Juvik's salon). One can almost hear Mama Juvik's joy as they gaze at the photo spread and exclaims, “Look, honey, we're famous, just like the Kardashians.”
Yes, just like the Kardashians.
If Mama Juvik really wanted to help their daughter, they would provide them with some simple guidance on how women's breasts are a beautiful thing—so beautiful, in fact, that they can be distracting to boys. They might counsel when it's appropriate to go braless—at home. They could explain to their daughter that exposing them for everyone to see is not only impolite, but also unfair to the opposite sex (and not to leave out the lesbians at school, naturally, who might also be distracted). Fairness and equal opportunity is paramount, after all. Or isn't it?

EXCLUSIVE! Lisa Vanderpump Explains Why They Teamed Up With Sharon Osbourne To Take A Stand Against The Yulin Dog Festival — Watch Their Haunting PSA HERE!
Lisa Vanderpump and Sharon Osbourne are taking action against the horrific Yulin Dog Festival.
The two animal enthusiasts teamed up to produce a PSA about the terrible event in China that celebrates the brutalization and slaughter of defenseless dogs so they can be eaten for pleasure.
Disgusting.
In the announcement, the Real Housewives star calls viewers to action, inviting them to participate in a march to the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles on World Animal Day — October 4.
Video: EXCLUSIVE! Lisa Spills The Tea & Catches Us Up To Speed On RHOBH!
We've learned EXCLUSIVELY that Lisa filmed the haunting video (above) in their home on the day before their birthday. They also included the Osbourne matriarch because they've been friends for a really long time, and Sharon shares Lisa's passion for their furry friends.
Miz Vanderpump has opened up to us in the past about the horrible holiday, but now she's explaining why they decided to organize the march:
“When I saw the horrific images of dogs being tortured and slaughtered for their meat my heart got heavy. Right then and there I said to myself, I'm going to do everything I can to put an end to this so called ‘festival.' This is what I want on my epitaph. I want it to say this woman was instrumental in ending the barbaric torture of these poor creatures.”
We're really proud of Lisa and Sharon for standing up against this terrible tradition, and we really hope they are able to make a difference.
If you're in the area on October 4, head to MacArthur Park at 10 a.m. to join the movement.
While no one has counted cognitively impaired inmates, experts say that prisoners appear more prone to dementia than the general population because they often have more risk factors: limited education, hypertension , diabetes , smoking, depression , substance abuse , even head injuries from fights and other violence.
Many states consider over-50 prisoners elderly, saying they age up to 15 years faster.
With many prisons already overcrowded and understaffed, inmates with dementia present an especially difficult challenge. They are expensive — medical costs for older inmates range from three to nine times as much as those for younger inmates. They must be protected from predatory prisoners. And because dementia makes them paranoid or confused, feelings exacerbated by the confines of prison, some attack staff members or other inmates, or unwittingly provoke fights by wandering into someone else's cell.
“The dementia population is going to grow tremendously,” says Ronald H. Aday, a sociologist and the author of “Aging Prisoners: Crisis in American Corrections.” “How are we going to take care of them?”
Some prison systems are confronting that now. Many would like to transfer demented inmates to nursing homes , but their often-violent crimes make states reluctant to parole them and nursing homes reluctant to take them.
New York has taken the top-dollar route, establishing a separate unit for cognitively impaired inmates and using professional caregivers, at a cost of about $93,000 per bed annually, compared with $41,000 in the general prison population. Pennsylvania and other states are giving mental health workers special dementia training.
But some struggling prison systems, including those in Louisiana and California, are taking a less expensive but potentially riskier approach. They are training prisoners to handle many of the demented inmates' daily needs.
“Yeah, they did something horrible to end up here,” said Cheryl Steed, a psychologist at the California Men's Colony, where prisoners who help inmates with dementia are called Gold Coats because their yellow jackets contrast with the standard-issue blue. But without them, they said, “we wouldn't be able to care for our dementia patients very well.”

After escorting Joaquin Cruz to an appointment, James Evers, a Gold Coat, was returning them to their adobe-colored cellblock when they encountered corrections officers strip-searching inmates for missing tools.
Mr. Cruz, 60, who barely recalls that they are in prison for killing someone who sold them fake cocaine, grew confused and resistant when guards tried searching him. “He has Alzheimer's,” Mr. Evers managed to explain. “It's not that he's refusing to do what you're asking.”
At the prison, shadowed by seacoast mountains, Gold Coats are paid $50 a month and have better knowledge of impaired prisoners' conditions than many prison guards. Gold Coats, trained by the Alzheimer's Association and given thick manuals on dementia, were the first to notice when Mr. Cruz began putting their boots on the wrong feet and “started pulling down their pants and going to the bathroom wherever they are,” said Phillip Burdick, a Gold Coat who is serving a life sentence for beating a man to death with a hammer.
Gold Coats report these changes, often at weekly support group meetings with Dr. Steed. They identify “different tricks and strategies to get guys to do what they need to do,” they said.
Before the program was started in 2009, demented inmates frequently caused fights, hitting those they considered threatening or disturbing other prisoners by encroaching on their turf. “The whole atmosphere was hostile,” said Bettina Hodel, a psychologist who started the program and once narrowly avoided being struck herself. Now, Gold Coats absorb much of that behavior.

“I have been swung at, got a big fat lip, and my glasses have been broken,” said Ramon Cañas, a Gold Coat who killed a hitchhiker who stole their car. They said Gold Coats — there are currently six of them for about 40 inmates — often wear surgical gloves because they are exposed to “a lot of body fluids.”
Protecting the Vulnerable
But they also protect demented inmates from prisoners who try assaulting, abusing or robbing them. When Steven Berry, a Gold Coat, caught two inmates picking a demented prisoner's pockets, they barreled toward them. “Got the stuff back,” reported Mr. Berry, a former Navy signalman who killed their sister-in-law and tried to kill their wife.
Gold Coats get harassed and called snitches for seeming to side with prison officials and because of the perks they receive. In the dining hall, to help dementia patients who, as Mr. Burdick says, “start forgetting basic things like what is a spork for,” Gold Coats sit with them at special “slow eater” tables, where meals are allowed to stretch beyond the usual 10 to 12 minutes.

When a prisoner tried stealing a patient's dessert, Mr. Montgomery, one of the Gold Coats, snarled, “You got to give them their cookie back.”
“Who are you, the PO- lice ?” the inmate barked. Mr. Montgomery retorted, “Yes, I'm the PO-lice!”
More inmates have dementia than prison officials realize, experts say. Prison routines can mask symptoms like forgetfulness . Corrections officers are used to punishing aggressive inmates, not evaluating them for Alzheimer's.
“Not responding to questions appropriately, being belligerent — it's just considered bad behavior,” said Sharen Barboza, director of clinical operations for MHM Services, a prison mental health provider that trains prison officials.
New York's Unit for the Cognitively Impaired, begun five years ago, has so far cared for 84 inmates, but “there's a number of people in the system that we really haven't tapped,” said Paul Kleinman, the program's psychologist. “They're not being identified properly.”
Alzheimer's currently affects 5.4 million Americans, a number expected to double by 2040. Experts believe that Alzheimer's disease in prisons could grow two or three times as fast, said John Wilson, senior clinical operations specialist for MHM, because “protective factors that might mitigate developing dementia are slim to none in prison — things like complex jobs, rich social environment, leisure activities.”
Realizing that California, with nearly 13,000 inmates 55 and older, could not adequately care for demented prisoners, Dr. Hodel, when they were starting the Gold Coat program, asked the regional chapter of the Alzheimer's Association to train inmates to help. The chapter's area director, Sara Bartlett, worried that they and Arlene Stepputat, then the program director, would not be safe as “women in a man's prison.” They doubted whether violent felons could provide sensitive care.

Both women were surprised that inmates seemed more receptive, with less-complicated emotional ties to the patients than many of the people they trained to care for relatives at home. “They were much easier to work with,” Ms. Stepputat said.
Heriberto G. Sanchez, chief psychologist of the California Men's Colony, said prisoners “were appreciative that someone from the outside world thought they could do this.” One wrote in an evaluation, “Thank you for allowing me to feel human.”

The prison requires that Gold Coats have “a clean behavior record for about 5 to 10 years,” Dr. Steed said. So far, only one Gold Coat has been removed, because “he had problems” with dementia patients' messy eating and other behaviors, Dr. Hodel said.
For inmates, the job has attractions. It pays better than other prison work and polishes a prisoner's record.
Two Gold Coats have received parole.
One of them, Shawn Henderson, who got 25 years to life for a 1985 double murder and was twice denied parole, was released last February. Doing a job where “you get spit on, feces thrown on you, urine on you, you get cursed out” helped teach them to cope outside prison, said Mr. Henderson, 46. “Now when I come into an encounter like that on the street, I can be a lot more compassionate,” they said. “And I don't look at telling authorities as snitching anymore.”
Gold Coats conduct exercise classes and run meetings designed to stimulate memory and lessen disorientation . They escort inmates to doctors, acting as their intermediaries.
And they often need to be deft. One 73-year-old inmate stands by a gate most mornings, waiting for their long-dead mother to pick them up. Sometimes they refuse to shower, afraid of missing them Mr. Evers coaxes them inside, telling them that their mother “wants you to shower before they get here.”
More subtlety is required for Mr. Gregory, 71, who is serving a life sentence for brutalizing their girlfriend with a switchblade — throwing their body parts in the trash and getting caught, they said, when “I went right back to the room that I killed them in and had sex with another” woman. They do not believe they have dementia, but their gradually accumulating symptoms include breaking a mop over an inmate's head and writing to outside agencies under the delusion that they will be granted parole.

To assist Mr. Gregory, Samuel Baxter, a Gold Coat who fatally shot a co-worker, firing six times, gently reminds them about bed making and schedules. “You have to allow Mr. Gregory to come to you,” Mr. Baxter said.
There are limits to what Gold Coats can do. They can file patients' fingernails, for instance, but not clip them because that constitutes a professional caregiving responsibility that cannot legally be delegated to inmates. And there are indignities, like cleaning up after inmates who urinate on the floor.

“A year ago,” Mr. Baxter said, “I couldn't have said, ‘You know what man, I'm going to go help this grown man get in the shower,' ” and “get in there and help these guys wash theirself off.”
Gold Coats say they are moved by the work. “I'm a person who was broken,” said Mr. Burdick, who during 35 years in prison lost a wife to AIDS and a 16-year-old daughter to suicide. Dementia patients often “don't even say thank you,” they said, but “they just pat me like that and I know what that means.”
Mr. Cañas said: “I didn't have any feelings about other people. I mean, in that way, I was a predator.” Now, they said, “I'm a protector.”
Still, the Gold Coats have not figured out how to help Leon Baham.
When Mr. Baham, 71, received a dementia diagnosis a year ago, a psychiatrist, Dr. Russell Marks, noted that they pined for their wife “almost as though at moments they didn't realize” that their crime had been “murdering the woman they were tearful about.”
In a recent interview, Mr. Baham recalled the murder hazily: “Blood everywhere. They said, ‘Sweetheart.' ”
They have repeatedly been placed in the crisis center, once after “he urinated on the floor, they were banging their head on the cage, they needed a spit mask to prevent their spitting on others,” and they were “threatening to kill persons that they believed stole their watch,” Dr. Marks said.
After trying to enter the wrong cell, they told Dr. Steed, “I'm going to kill myself,” adding, “I don't want to live this way.”
They were sent to a psychiatric hospital, returning less depressed. But they often sit confused in the yard. “I forget why I was going out there,” Mr. Baham said. “I'm slipping a little bit.”

Still, they resist the Gold Coats' help and believes that they would have to pay them. Oblique assistance, like Mr. Burdick bringing them a jacket, is all they accept so far.
“I don't need them, you know,” Mr. Baham said.
‘I Was a Monster'
The compassion Secel Montgomery is required to show in their job as a Gold Coat was nowhere to be seen in the killing they committed in 1987. They wanted money for alcohol, and when their former sister-in-law refused, “I knocked their unconscious, tied them up and stabbed her.” Then they washed their hands and called their wife for a ride.
They grabbed things that had their fingerprints on them, but left their infant nephew there alone. “I figured that's kidnapping,” they explained.
Mr. Montgomery, sentenced to 26 years to life, spent 17 years in a high-security prison for “disobeying orders,” they said. They made contraband alcohol called “pruno.”
Only in 2000, after Mr. Montgomery, 47, was found with marijuana, accused of threatening a prison official and locked in the “hole,” did they decide to change. “I was a monster,” they said.
Families of demented inmates seem unperturbed that prisoners like Mr. Montgomery now have so much responsibility. Laura Eklund, Mr. Cruz's niece, said prison officials have asked if their relatives wanted them paroled, but the family has declined. “To be honest, the care he's receiving in prison, we could not match,” they said.
When Mr. Cruz spies their own reflection, they often believe it is their brother Sergio. To keep them from getting agitated, their cell mirror has been covered with tape. But now when they look into a toilet, they call: “Hey, my brother, he's down there. I can't get them out.”
Mr. Montgomery said they try to reassure Mr. Cruz, but if Mr. Cruz is locked in their cell, Mr. Montgomery — still a prisoner, after all — cannot enter even if they are allowed out of their own cell. They will call to Mr. Cruz through a tiny window in the thick metal door. “All I can do is say, ‘Cruz, come here, come here, come here,' but he'll stand there,” staring helplessly into the toilet and agonizing. “ ‘See, see, look, see.' ”
Foreword by Anthony Watts.
This essay is written by a student at the University of Wyoming, who finds themselves in the middle of a set of circumstances that are pushing them further into the realm of being a climate skeptic. It is an eye-opening read. I have verified the identity of the student, but per their request (due to the backlash they fear) I am allowing them to write under the pen name of “Clair Masters”
Guest essay by Clair Masters
The class was languid, most kids were on their phones, or surfing Facebook on their laptops. I sat with my notebook open in front of me, empty except for the lecture title at the top of the page. The professor put a slide up on the projector showing a chart relating CO2 and temperature over the course of a few million years, the one we've all seen by now. The CO2 curve lags after the Temperature one, and anyone's first reading of the chart would probably be that temperature is driving the CO2 changes, not the other way around, if there is any trend at all. I perked up slightly, it was new for a professor to show alternate data, and looked around expectantly at other students, waiting for some kind of reaction—confusion, frowns, anything to show they're seeing something that fights what we've been told since elementary school. I saw a few yawns, dull stares, people on their phones, though one loud girl who was a religious global warming fanatic was glaring at the slide, slouching in their seat so their hand could pet their (dubiously trained) service dog.
Besides her, no one cared, and certainly I was the only one who glanced up in surprise when our professor began to talk about the chart as if it didn't matter, something like “This trend suggests the opposite of what we know to be true” before moving on. I looked down at my notebook—friends and family tell me my face does not hide emotions well, and I didn't want my professor to know I was annoyed. I don't know why they even included it in the lecture, but that's what happens in these courses. It was incredible to me at the time, but my professors would often include evidence contrary to the anthropogenic climate change theory before quickly sweeping it aside with some short remark. It doesn't matter this data exists, it doesn't matter that there is debate in the climate science community—not here. This is a University, after all.
College wasn't when I first started questioning the “acceptable” views of climate change. As far back as middle school I was a tough case for teachers trying to push global warming. It was fashionable back in 2008 to rabidly teach the “polar bears are drowning” narrative after those photographs from 2007 that showed the bear standing on a single hunk of ice. Tragic! A picture like that was all it took to have most of my classmates nodding solemnly along while our teachers taught us about our carbon footprint—about how we were contributing to the plight of the poor polar bears with our gluttonous use of electricity, by our parents having more than one car.
An animal fanatic, I spent hours paging through my Zoobooks and animal encyclopedia collections, reading all about polar bears. A number stood out to me; 60 miles. Polar bears often swim for 60 miles to get from one body of solid ground to the next. Proud of myself, I brought it up to my science teacher, and instead of getting the glowing pat on the head I was used to when I did outside research for classes, I was chastised.
“You're wrong,” they said, looking surprisingly angry, “polar bears can't swim that far. Global warming is melting their home, and they're dying off.”
At the time, I thought of myself as a teacher's pet, the good student, so their tone took me completely by surprise. I wasn't trying to say global warming wasn't killing the bears, as far as I knew it was. My teachers told me so, so it must be true. Them denial about the swimming capabilities of the bears is what threw me off, and for the first time I was faced with doubting a teacher. Who do I trust, the books I've read or this teacher? Something changed in me around that time, and that seed of doubt they unknowingly planted ended up making me who I am today—a skeptic. Not just for climate change and the like, but for everything. I abruptly stopped believing everything my teachers told me, it was a hard wake-up call to the real world as I realized that adults had agendas.
This idea was reinforced when one of the books in a beloved young adult series by James Patterson abandoned the original plot and conflict to go fight against global warming—essentially like rewriting the X-Men as Captain Planet. Horrified and disgusted that the characters would rather go protect those (at this point, goddamn) polar bears than stop the original mad scientist threat, I recognized the real propaganda element of this whole global warming deal. I started fighting back in small ways, mostly in the form of asking questions; “Don't we breathe out CO2?”, “Warmer weather will help some animals, won't it?”. I was not popular with my seventh-grade teachers. My friends were oblivious to my small insurrection; I was always the kid who raised their hand in class anyway.
It wasn't until my senior year of high school that I finally got the scientific background to really combat the ideas that were being pushed on me. I took a high level environmental science class that pushed me to dig deep and question what I thought I knew about the way our climate works. I loved that class, and for once I had a teacher who didn't try to shut me up. They acknowledged and engaged me, didn't brush away my questions, and every year since my graduation from high school I've given a short presentation over Skype to their class about Petroleum engineering, petroleum geology, a little paleontology, and college life.
I distinctly remember two specific moments in that class that were “a-ha” moments for me. The first is when we watched that required documentary: Gasland. Some of the claims made in that documentary were beyond absurd, and like the skeptical jerk I am, I fact-checked while watching it in class. On the school-administered iPad, I googled every single thing Josh Fox presented that got my spider-sense tingling. Antelope in Wyoming are going extinct? Not even close. Fracking fluid is in people's water, letting them light it on fire? Try naturally occurring methane. At this point, I was already toying with the idea of going into some kind of geological science, and I was intrigued by the idea of fracking technology. We did a short lab in that class where we tried to get oil out of sand, and I thought it was cool. It was my love of all fields of science, not to mention the thrill of being involved in such a villainous industry, that helped me decide on Petroleum Engineering.
The other moment was when we were focusing on alternative energy, including a lengthy discussion about Hydrogen powered cars. I raised my hand quickly.
“If we're worried about CO2 causing global warming, wouldn't it be much worse if we were all driving cars that had water vapor as their exhaust?”
They paused, thinking it over. “I think you might be right, that's a very interesting observation.” They said, before re-explaining to the class what I was talking about, how water vapor captures much more heat than carbon dioxide. I felt good about being able to apply what I learned about climate and our atmosphere to challenging popular “green” narratives. The best part was that my teacher was so supportive, and was willing to admit when something our textbook claimed wasn't entirely true.
It has been a very different ride in college. Exhausting, as now I'm surrounded by professors and students who promote anthropogenic climate change predictions with such intensity, it makes the most zealous cultist fanatics look calm and reasonable. Again and again I'm surprised by the reactions of my peers to my skepticism, sometimes I even prompt truly angry reactions from people. One crunchy granola geology guy engaged me in a conversation about alternative energy, they tried to argue that hemp oil would soon overtake our need for fossil fuels. Right. Somehow the conversation got to land use, and I expressed an opinion that the states probably could deal with their environmental problems and land use better than federal agencies—he quoted something about the Koch Brothers, and I left them for class. Maybe a week later, they handed me a piece of notebook paper with “research” written up on it—mostly a series of bullet points about the American Lands Council which they somehow connected to white supremacy, right wing fanaticism, and most bizarrely of all the Kim Davis controversy. I couldn't believe that someone who was a “scientific” person felt the need to use the guilt by association trap, the screeching leftist “Racist! Sexist! Homophobe!” nonsense in a discussion about land use. I gave up my favorite study spot after that, opting to avoid them instead of giving them the what-for I'd so like to. I don't have time for that—I have school to worry about.
There have been plenty of times that I wondered if it's my perspective that is wrong, I've done some soul searching on the topics I'm passionate about. College has challenged my views, while it seems to only confirm the ideas that the “warmists” hold. Some of my previously held beliefs have changed, like much of what I understood (or thought I understood) about climate, but I've still yet to be presented solid evidence for primary anthropogenic climate change that isn't either refuted by another study, or backed with accusations like the ones crunchy granola guy lobbed my way. I've stopped being shocked by the way my professors obediently tow the party line—as I learned a few years ago that at least here, federal funding is dependent on a certain amount of global warming acceptance. I'm thankful for the engineering courses I'm taking, because if my geology and earth sciences were not balanced out by the dry technical calculations of engineering, I'd probably lose my mind. (Just imagine how bad it would be if I were in sociology or women's studies!) I am disappointed by the quality of the “science” taught at University though—when theory is presented as fact, and computer models are regarded as gospel despite their infamous unreliability, it's not actual science.
It's propaganda—dogmatic as any religion.
It's my 5th year since heading west for my engineering degree. This year I'm taking a handful of great little petroleum classes, and finishing off my geology minor. Of course, it's my geology class that is giving me a headache. A mineral resource course sounds pretty straightforward… except of course our professor managed to turn it into a climate change/ humans are killing everything/ we're all going to die class. We even have a section of the class towards the end of the semester dedicated to social justice, because that's why I'm getting a science degree. In retrospect, I should have known what I was getting into when I looked around and saw several students with either half shaved heads or hair colors that in nature scream “I'm toxic”.
It's gonna be a fun semester, and I'll try to keep you updated.
The whole Alan Gross affairs has been bizarre from start to finish. Why was the government giving them six million dollars to provide Cuba's tiny but privileged Jewish minoirty of less than 2000 internet access? (Most Cuban Jews went into exile in Florida back in the 1960s.) This represented almost a third of the USAID Cuba Program, which is aimed at “promoting democracy.” According to their Wikipedia page, when Gross was arrested
they were carrying a high-tech chip,[21] intended to keep satellite phone transmissions from being located within 250 miles (400 kilometres). The chip is not available on the open market. It is provided most frequently to the CIA and the Defense Department, but can also be obtained by the State Department, which oversees USAID. Asked how Gross obtained the card, a USAID spokesperson said that the agency played no role in helping Gross acquire equipment.[20]
The following article will help unravel some of the mystery of how a Jewish business person trying to enrich themselves while undermining a foreign government could become the President's “Guest of Honor” at Washington's biggest annual power elite event.
Alan Gross, Guest of Honor
By John Stoehr
If you didn't know anything about Alan Gross other than what you saw on television, you probably thought it was appropriate for them to sit next to First Lady Michelle Obama as a guest of honor at this year's State of the Union address.
Television news reporting told the story of Gross as a humanitarian unjustly jailed in 2009 by a repressive Communist regime for the crime of bringing intent access to Cuba's small Jewish community. Their release from prison in December was part of President Obama's plan to normalize diplomatic relations with Cuba after half a century of regime-change policy in the United States.
This TV news narrative had bipartisan support. In announcing their administration's shift in Cuba policy, Obama said Gross “was arrested by Cuban authorities for simply helping ordinary Cubans.” Marco Rubio, the anticommunist Republican senator from Florida, said Gross was innocent of all charges against them and that he'd been “taken hostage” for “helping the Jewish community in Cuba have access to the internet.”
Neither was the case. They aren't “simply” helping ordinary Cubans. They aren't “taken hostage” and they were not “innocent” of breaking Cuban law.

Although Brandon Bevers has been subjected on social media to accusations that they were somehow connected to their wife Missy Bevers' death, Texas investigators said they accept their alibi and the husband is cooperating with their murder investigation. Their wife was beaten to death with a hammer inside a Midloathian, Texas, church as they were preparing for a sunrise fitness class. Security video shows the apparent killer walking the church hallways carrying the murder weapon, but a makeshift police SWAT uniform and helmet hide the person's identity.
The husband has been declining media interviews since soon after their wife's murder, but Brandon Bevers corresponded with Crime Stories through several emails over the past years. We received a new statement in December, which we shared with lawyer and psychiatrist Dr. Brian Russell, host of Investigation Discovery's “Fatal Vows” series, and Cold Case Research Institute director Sheryl McCollum.
Dr. Russell and McCollum join Nancy Grace and Alan Duke in this Crime Stories episode to discuss what the husband is now saying and to update the investigation into this unsolved crime.

Read Brandon Bevers full email to Crime Stories:
“My family's story….
Well, we all have good days, and bad. The children are not terribly fond of apprehending this person. They don't want to revisit those emotions-they have told me this. They see/hear the daily anxiety I have in finding this person, and I think they are tired of the mentality this puts our day-to-day life in. They want normalcy, and happiness. I want justice, but I too fear the reality of bringing this case/person to trial and the emotional uncertainty that may go with it.So you have to ask yourself, do you bang your head on the wall everyday with this? Do you allow the unsolved aspect of this to infiltrate your thoughts- put yourself in a foul state of mind every day when you have three kids to focus on?
Starting 2018, I'm done allowing this uncertainty to control me this way. I will leave the head banging, and brain rot to the investigators. Trust me when I say they are qualified. I have spent most of this time feeling my responsibility to Missy was to find this person- That's just not realistic. My duty to Missy is to memorialize their life, and that is exactly what I will do for her, and the children's sake. They deserve this for all that they have contributed in our lives. I'm done talking about this investigation, theories, etc… I wish all of the whack job social media stuff would go to hell. Why do these people not realize they have left a door open for my children to peer into one day? How damaging could this be? No factual basis for all of the speculation whatsoever!
This behavior has not left Missy the real legacy they deserve- particularly in my children's eyes.From this point forward, the only thing I will discuss is “who” Missy was. Them contributions to my life, the children, this family, and numerous other people that they loved. You bet I loved them I know without a doubt they loved me. Don't you see the real value in this? There is no value in discussing events that led up to their murder, or to speculate if they were targeted and why. What if the perp enjoys listening to all of this rhetoric? What this person needs to hear is “who” they took from us. The Mother, The Wife, The Daughter, Sister, Friend, etc…
These topics are more relevant and purposeful than anything else as far as logic is concerned.The activity surrounding this investigation is best left to the investigators. They have way more concrete information that isn't up for discussion, or for sale.
Yes, you can share this. Its all I have to say right now.
Thank You,
Brandon Bevers”

On Monday, Julia Collins' 20-game Jeopardy! winning streak came to an end when they bet everything on a Final Jeopardy clue that read: “The New England writer who in 1999 became the last person to win an Oscar for adapting their own novel as a screenplay.” Collins guessed Michael Chabon, when the correct answer was John Irving. However, despite their loss, Collins' 20-game record puts them in second place for the most consecutive wins on the show, behind only Ken Jennings, and makes them the winningest woman in the show's history.
But what was it about the final clue that threw her? And what is their advice to future contestants? We chatted with Collins about all of those things, as well as what they did with that money:
ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Why did you choose to bet everything on Final Jeopardy?
JULIA COLLINS: That's a good question. It was a new scenario for me. Every other game that I played, I was in the lead going into Final Jeopardy, so it was a novelty. It was something that hadn't happened, and I guess I just thought I'd go for broke. I think if I had to do it again, I might not have bet the same way, but I don't feel bad about it. Brian [Loughnane] was in the lead. I had talked to them a little bit before we played, and I figured they would bet to win, which is what they did. It was kind of a silly thing, because if they had gotten the wrong response and I had gotten it wrong but bet more modestly, I would still be playing, but as it was, they got the right response and I didn't. They were going to win with that right response regardless of my wager, so I haven't beaten myself up about it too much. I think if things had gone differently in terms of their response, then I might feel differently, but you can't change what's happened. It wouldn't have changed the outcome with that Final Jeopardy clue.
So it sounds like it was a little bit about you reading them and anticipating what they were going to do.
A little bit. I just thought, “What would I do if I was in the lead? I would bet to win,” which is what I did every single day. The one time I made a little math mistake, but that was my strategy. I wasn't going to go into Final Jeopardy in the lead, get the answer right, and not win the game. That was my mentality, and I had the feeling that was also going to be their mentality. I kind of would assume that about anybody, but definitely him. And that was the case.
Was there something they could've included in that clue that would've helped you?
I don't know. I just couldn't think of it. It never occurred to me that [John Irving] was the answer. I've read other books by him, but I haven't read Cider House Rules and hadn't — well, I watched a little bit of the movie after we taped and then had to turn it off, but I hadn't seen the movie, hadn't read the book. I've read a couple of their other books. I probably could've stood up there for a lot longer and not come up with the right response.  They are associated with New England, that's definitely true, but he's not the writer I associate most with New England. I would've thought Stephen King, which frankly would've been a better guess than Michael Chabon. I was thinking of Wonder Boys, which came out in a year around 1999 [Ed. note: It came out in 2000]. I was thinking that was set in New England. I don't know. I just wanted to write something. I didn't actually think it was right, which was usually the case in Final Jeopardy — when I wasn't right, it wasn't because I thought I was right; I just thought “I don't want to leave it blank.” That's the way the cookie crumbles.
You wrote about being on Jeopardy! in your eighth-grade yearbook, so was this something you'd consistently been preparing for?
I haven't been explicitly preparing for it. I feel like the things I'm interested in have been well-suited for being a Jeopardy! player. I love to read. I'll read just about anything. I read a lot of different kinds of publications. I do read a lot, although I hadn't read that book that was in question yesterday. [Laughs] I think that helps a lot. I like to do things where I'm learning. I'm good at remembering a lot of facts. I've always been that way. I found my niche with Jeopardy! It wasn't so much that I've been preparing for Jeopardy! as that Jeopardy! was the right outlet for all my interests and strengths.
So when did you decide to formally try and become a contestant?
It had been an idle thought when I was a kid. I'm not sure if they had the kids tournament when I was a child. They did have the high school and college tournaments, but it didn't occur to me at that time to try out. I think I thought my parents wouldn't go for sending me to L.A. I didn't really think about it seriously until I found that they have an online test that you can take to become a contestant. They offer it every January. It takes about 10 minutes. There are 50 questions. It's not a big time commitment. It's a low threshold. It doesn't require a lot for me to do it — a sound internet connection, basically.
In 2009 I took the test online the first time, and I actually got called to an in-person tryout that year. I think I was just way too nervous to be on TV at that point. I don't think it was a knowledge-level issue, I think it was that I really wasn't TV-ready. Then I took the test at least one other time and didn't get called for a tryout. From what I gather, 100,000 or more take the test every year and they have about 2,000 come to the tryouts. I assume they randomly select or something.
So I took the test again in January 2013 and got called to try out in Detroit last summer, and then got a call in December inviting me to be a contestant in January, which is when my first show taped.
You've talked a lot about your buzzer skills, but what is the biggest tip you'd give future competitors?
Getting the hang of the buzzer, if you can get that down, you'll be in a lot better of a position. But I would say try to learn the things you're not as strong in before you get to the show, but once you get on stage, once the show starts, don't focus on what you don't know. I think that really rattles people. Or if you try to buzz in and someone beats you, don't get discouraged. A lot of the game is psychological. I think a lot of people get frustrated or discouraged.
There were a few times when I think I got a little rattled, a few times when I buzzed in because I was like, “Oh, that's too much silence, I want to buzz in!” [Laughs] But I found out yesterday that the number of questions I answered correctly from ringing in, excluding Daily Doubles and Final Jeopardy, was like 92 percent, so I didn't really ring in unless I knew the answer or I was pretty confident I could figure out the right response from the context. That's a big thing. Focus on what you do know. It's a little bit like if you ever took AP exams in high school, it's “Write down as much as you know for the responses on the essays.” If you don't know something, don't talk about it. That's not that different from how I approached Jeopardy! You don't have to know everything to be successful.
What category would you ace, no questions asked?
The things that I would've said before I went on Jeopardy! were Literature, History, Art. I missed questions in all those categories. [Laughs] I don't know if this is a spoiler, [but in] today's game there's a category on Rodgers and Hammerstein, and I was hoping for a Musicals category. I watched that game after I was done, and that Rodgers and Hammerstein category, I would've loved that. I would've been all over that! [Laughs] Even the things I'm the most interested in, I don't know everything. But my strongest categories were definitely Literature, History, Art.
What did you do with the money? I read about Paris?
Yeah! I went in the interim between taping and airing. I thought, I'm not working, so I have all this time, and I have some savings, and I knew after mid-February after I finished taping the show that I was going to get this huge win total — even after taxes, it's so much money, it's incredible! And I thought, “What am I going to do with myself for these weeks until the shows air?” I kind of felt like I could take a little break from my job search, and I wanted to be able to enjoy the full experience of winning, to be able to do the fun things that go along with winning to the scale that I did. I wanted to take a break. So I thought, “What would be really fun and distract me from all the waiting around and get me away from this horrendous Chicago winter?” It was fantastic. I rented an apartment, I basically played tourist for a month. I had some people come and visit me while I was there. It was just a wonderful, wonderful time. That's my big splurge with my winnings.
What would you want your clue to read? If in a future game, the answer was “Who is Julia Collins?”
Oh gosh! That's an excellent question!
It could obviously say the winningest woman in the show's history…
I guess you could say, “19-game winning streak stood as the longest since Ken Jennings for 10 years until this contestant broke it in 2014.” You could say that. That's kind of boring. [Laughs]
Is there anything people don't know about you?
This has been my hidden talent and secret ambition, so the cat's out of the bag on those two. [Laughs] That I love Jeopardy! I love watching it; I love playing it even more than I love watching it. I just love watching TV. I don't understand when people say, “I don't have a TV.” I think TV gives you so much for so little. [Laughs] I love TV. I love comedies.
What's your favorite show right now?
Some of my favorite shows have been ending. I loved 30 Rock. I have to say, The Simpsons never gets old for me. They just had that Lego episode. That was great! Not every episode is perfect, but it's still funny. I still laugh out loud. The jokes are still funny, though I'm a pretty easy audience for a joke. Anything that makes me laugh, I'm happy to watch over and over again. Drama gets a little boring for me, but comedy never does. I really love TV. Movies are not as much my thing. I mean, I like movies because I'm a human being, but yeah, I just watch television. I just love it!

Iris said that Best has four months left. If I recall correctly, Best is not in the army but doing some alternative form of service due to their back injuries or something. Best is probably not allowed to stream during this period. Iris said that Best has four months left.

A/N: Trigger warnings for scenes that will occur in later chapters- there will be references to abuse/neglect. If this is likely to upset you, you might want to read a different fic.
With all that being said, let's begin!
CHAPTER ONE: IT'S TRADITION
It had become an unofficial tradition at Hogwarts to take bets on which Houses the first years would be Sorted into — not that he, Severus, would admit to taking part in such a tradition. No, Severus Snape was not a betting man, although they did make certain... investments in students they knew would be Sorted into the House of Snakes.
"Now what about Longbottom," Filius asked conversationally. "He didn't lack for bravery from either parent, although Alice was a Hufflepuff."
"Five sickles says they go to Gryffindor," said Pomona.
Minerva looked scandalized. "Really, Pomona, betting against your own House?"
The Herbology witch shrugged, clearly not wishing to share their thought process.
Severus smirked. Few people realized that Pomona housed an incredibly shrewd mind behind their friendly face. The Hat may wish to put Longbottom in Hufflepuff, but they will certainly end up in Gryffindor — that awful grandmother of their likely doesn't shut up about their alleged virtues. "Five galleons says that Malfoy, Parkinson, Crabbe, Goyle, Greengrass, Nott and Zabini will be in Slytherin."
Minerva scowled. "Severus, that's hardly fair...all of them are practically shoo-ins…"
Severus fixed them with a cold glare. "I hope you aren't typecasting any students, Minerva," they said silkily.
The Gryffindor matriarch looked flustered. "Of course not! I just -"
Filius took pity on them "He's just baiting you -"
"Severus!"
"So what about the muggle borns," Filius asked, clearly trying to steer the conversation into calmer waters.
"I do believe Minerva has a distinct advantage in that realm," Severus cut in. "After all, they are the one who delivers their letters."
"That's how it is every year, Severus."
"I know. And that's the reason I seldom bet on the muggleborns."
"You've never bet on a muggleborn."
"Never say never," Severus snarked.
"Pssh. I'll bet a galleon that you won't bet on a muggleborn's Sorting this year," Minerva scoffed.
Severus pretended to consider the notion for a moment. Really, it was too easy to manipulate their coworkers. "Who are my options?" they asked, trying to sound reluctant.
"Terry Boot, Kevin Entwhistle, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hermione Granger, and Dean Thomas. Take your pick."
Severus pretended to consider once again. "Alright. One knut -"
"Severus, a legitimate bet!"
"Fine. Ten sickles -"
"At least over a galleon!"
Severus sighed in annoyance. "One galleon, one sickle, and one knut that Granger will be sorted into Slytherin."
Minerva snorted. "You can say goodbye to your money. Everything about that girl screams Ravenclaw."
Severus raised an eyebrow. Last time they checked, they were a far better judge of character than Minerva. "If you say so." They stood to leave. "I have a potion that needs to be checked on. I will see you at the Sorting."
They left the staff room and headed towards the dungeons as their thoughts slowly turned towards the bushy haired girl they met in Diagon Alley.
The bushy haired girl paused for a moment outside of Flourish and Blotts. A look of longing passed over their face, but it was quickly wiped away as they headed towards the secondhand bookstore. Severus took a quick stock of their person - faded but clean muggle clothes, a box from Ollivander's sticking out from the second-hand robe shop bag, and no parents in sight.
What? Severus mentally backtracked. Clothing convincingly muggle. First purchases were a wand and robes. No parents in sight. Severus was uncomfortably reminded of their first trip to Diagon Alley - no, don't think of that.
Severus followed the girl into Thorne's Secondhand Bookshop, trying their best not to look like a creepy stalker.
"I'm looking for the Hogwarts first year textbooks," the girl said quietly yet confidently. "I have my list right here -"
"You'll find most of them over there," Alastor Thorne grumbled, gesturing to the left side of the shop."
"Thanks." The girl scurried off.
Severus stepped forward, and Alastor's grumpy face broke into a grin. "Severus! Long time, no see."
"It's that time of year again."
"Ah yes, the start of school."
"Unfortunately."
"Don't look so grim. I'm sure not all your students are complete dunderheads."
"You'd be surprised."
Alastor shrugged. Severus said the same things about their students each year. "There's a couple of relatively new potions journals in the back, if you're interested."
Severus nodded their thanks, their mind clearly already occupied with potions. They walked over to the back corner of the shop, scanning the shelves as they went - and ooh, was that the May edition of Potions Today? Severus snapped up the (only slightly) battered copy. And was that last year's copy of the Mastery magazine? Severus shuffled through the pile for a couple minutes before heading over towards the first year books - not because they were concerned about the girl or anything - they needed… a couple more extra copies of the first year potions textbooks - yes, that was it - he, Severus, was definitely not a caring, sentimental man. Absolutely not. They were sure of it.
The girl was standing facing one of the bookshelves and had a pile of books next to them Severus recognized the distinctive black and gold binding of The Standard Book of Spells as well as the navy binding of A Beginner's Guide to Transfiguration. The green and gray book was Magical Drafts and Potions, and the plain gray one was clearly The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection, which left - Severus followed the girl's gaze to the top shelf - One Hundred Magical Herbs and Fungi.
Severus sighed. I suppose I ought to play the gentleman and help them get the book down. They scoffed inwardly. He, Severus Snape, was contemplating helping a student out of their own free will? Absurd! Maybe they really are going soft…
Books shifted, and Severus was jerked from their musings. They looked up, expecting to see a collapsing bookshelf, or really anything that was more - no, not logical - but more expected than the sight of an old copy of One Hundred Magical Herbs and Fungi wiggling its way out from between its neighbors to land in the girl's hands. Severus raised an eyebrow, which was the equivalent of an average person jumping up and down doing a jig. The wandless magic alone was impressive, but the control exerted was a clear indicator of the girl's impressive raw magical talent. A look of satisfaction flitted over the girl's face, then they sat down suddenly with a slight ooph.
Concern flashed through Severus' mind as they hurried over. Had they - no… "Are you alright?"
The girl was very pale, but nodded slowly.
"A verbal answer, please," Severus asked out of habit, mentally wincing as the words came out of their mouth. The girl didn't know him. She'd think them mad - or cruel - not that they should care -
"I'm fine - I just get dizzy sometimes, that's all. I've done this before. I'll be okay in a couple minutes."
"You've done this before." Severus' mind was spinning.
"Well, yes - but only with small objects." The girl looked slightly uncomfortable. "I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name earlier - what was it?"
Smooth. "Professor Snape. I teach at Hogwarts. And your name is…?"
"Hermione Granger," the girl quickly supplied. "What subject do you teach?"
"Potions."
"Oh, fantastic," the girl - Granger - said as they straightened up, scooping their books into their arms. "I need to purchase my potions supplies - perhaps you could point me in the right direction?"
Severus responded in the affirmative, and they headed towards the register. Granger carefully counted out the necessary coins from a muggle change purse and started to heft the bag of books onto their shoulder.
"Wait one moment, Miss Granger," Severus said. Granger looked at them in askance as they cast a Featherlight charm on their bag. "The charm will last a couple hours." They handed the bag back to Granger, and their eyes widened slightly.
"Thank you, sir," they said.
Severus felt somewhat uncomfortable. It was only a Featherlight charm. "You're welcome," they managed.
Severus murmured the password to their private lab. That hadn't been the only occasion Granger made them feel uncomfortable - the fact that the girl was using their own pocket money to pay for necessary school supplies didn't sit well with him. When they pressed them for details, they had completely closed up, which disturbed him. In fact, the more they spoke with her, the more their concern grew - and it wasn't because of the things they said, rather, it was what they left unsaid. Severus originally pegged the girl for Ravenclaw, but their practiced avoidance of their questions was a strong indicator of Slytherin.
Severus sat down heavily, mind flashing back to their parting words.
They had given them several books that would be useful in understanding wizarding culture- Hogwarts, A History; Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century; Modern Magical History; and So You Just Found Out You're A Wizard. The girl had been slightly uncomfortable with the gift, but they had stowed the books carefully in their bag.
"Professor -" they began, "there was something someone said in a shop that confused me. It was something about" they paused, searching for the correct word "Houses at Hogwarts?"
Severus had sighed. "Yes, Hogwarts, A History will explain them to you -"
"Oh, sorry, I can just read about them then -"
"Admittedly, the book is quite biased." Severus wasn't sure what made them interject. "Students are Sorted into one of four Houses when they arrive at Hogwarts based on their strengths. Gryffindor prizes bravery, Ravenclaw - intelligence, Hufflepuff - loyalty, and Slytherin - cleverness and ambition."
"The person in the shop said something about Slytherin being... bad"
Severus scanned their face, looking for a sign of malice. Seeing none, they forged ahead. "I'm sure the individual said that in a far more - ah, expressive - manner. People tend to dislike those who are smarter, cleverer and more successful than they are." Pain briefly flashed across the girl's face. "Slytherin House has produced many successful witches and wizards. Unfortunately, the most recent Dark Lord was also a Slytherin, and people, being who people are, make generalizations that really do not apply." Severus felt defensive. "There is nothing bad about being in Slytherin, understood?"
"Yes, sir."
"Good. One more thing before you go," Severus paused, trying to word their advice properly. Should I even tell her… "I advise that you don't reveal your blood status to anyone. There are some wizards who do not take kindly to those of non-magical origins. If someone presses you, make something up and stick with it - allude to the fact one of your parents might be magical - maybe they refuse to talk about their past, so you have no idea of knowing if they are a wizard or not.
"Whatever you decide to say, make it believable. Every lie as a grain of truth at its center."
"Of course, sir. Thank you for telling me."
Severus brushed off them thank you. "I will see you at Hogwarts. Safe travels, Miss Granger."
The girl had vanished into the bustle of the bus station, leaving Severus alone. I hope they make it back alright.
Severus smirked at the memory. Sentimental fool. You'll turn into Molly Weasley at this rate. Severus shuddered at the thought. The Sorting will be interesting this year, that's for certain.

Two days after Tulsi Das allegedly hanged themselves following a tiff with their “husband”, their body lies at Tinsukia police station in upper Assam over a dispute on how the last rites should be performed.
Das, 23, had eloped four months ago with Bitu Ali, 27, said police. Though they lived together at a rented accommodation in Tinsukia town, there are no records to suggest if they got married or either of them converted to the other's faith, police added.
Police said the Muslim community refused to bury the body due to “lack of proof” of their wedding with Ali and Hindus were against cremating them because they had “married” outside the faith.
“On Saturday night, the couple, who used to quarrel often, had another tiff. While Bitu Ali left home, the woman locked themselves in and committed suicide by hanging,” said Girin Sonowal, in-charge of police station at Margherita. Ali works at a hotel in Margherita.
“On hearing of their wife's death, Ali went back to Tinsukia and brought their body to Margherita for burial. But they were turned back from two burial grounds on Sunday as they didn't have any documentary proof of their wedding as per Muslim rituals,” Sonowal added.
Das's body was taken to their hometown Digboi, nearly 17 km away, in an attempt to cremate them But locals refused to allow the last rites as per Hindu rituals.
“The body was brought back to Margherita. But since the suicide took place at Tinsukia, which is 50 km away, we sent back the body there on Sunday night,” said Sonowal.
Puna Gogoi, in-charge of Tinsukia police station, said on Monday, “It is a very unfortunate incident. The woman's family has been contacted. Till a decision is taken, the body will be kept at the police station or shifted to a government hospital morgue.”

Fifteen minutes.
That's all it takes for children and people without IDs to buy illegal weapons on Facebook pages dedicated to the sale and celebration of guns.
A VentureBeat investigation has uncovered dozens of pages on Facebook where guns are for sale, including semi-automatic weapons, handguns, and silencers. While the transactions don't actually happen on Facebook, the social network is a remarkably easy way to find shady people willing to sell you a weapon — no questions asked. The illegal transactions then take place in diners, dark parking lots, and isolated country roads — away from the prying eyes of the feds and local police.
In Kentucky, Greenup County Sheriff Keith Cooper remembers when a call came into dispatch last October saying a 15-year-old student had been arrested on the Greenup County High School campus for carrying an unlicensed and loaded 9mm handgun to school. The boy was arrested and brought to Cooper's office for an interview.
When Cooper, a former Kentucky State Trooper with a heavy Southern drawl, asked the kid where they got the gun, their reply was shocking: Facebook.
As it turns out, the 15 year old's purchase wasn't an anomaly. Facebook pages have been a thriving market for facilitating gun purchases.
Even in their names, the Facebook fan pages make no attempt to hide what their real purposes are: Firearms Only Alamogordo, Guns for Sale, I Love Guns, and even Guns, Ammo & Blades.

The pages have hundreds of thousands of “likes” and members. While many of the sales are no doubt legitimate — federal law governing gun transactions between individuals are fairly lax — hooking up with illicit buyers and sellers via these pages is easy. For instance, you can buy automatic weapons without a permit, guns with their serial numbers filed off, and weapons that may be prohibited by your state's laws. If you're under 18, you can buy a handgun, which federal law prohibits.
On Tuesday, a VentureBeat reporter and their colleague spent less than 15 minutes arranging to buy a semiautomatic 7mm rifle and 90 rounds of ammunition from a guy named “Dave,” a member of Facebook “Firearms Only Alamogordo” fan page (left).
VentureBeat made contact through the fan page, and in the ensuing SMS chat, Dave expressed an eagerness to do the deal. The gun was in good condition, they explained.
When a VentureBeat reporter asked Dave if they needed to bring identification to complete the sale, their response was an immediate “no.”
Emerging threats
Numerous interviews with federal law enforcement authorities, city police agencies, and anti-gun advocacy groups show how they view Facebook, Instagram, and other social media platforms with growing alarm as highly effective and unregulated online arms bazaars where people who shouldn't be owning — or selling — guns can find a seemingly endless pool of eager customers with no questions asked.
“We look at Facebook and others as emerging threats for unlawful gun transactions in the United States,” a federal law enforcement officer told VentureBeat.
And as the VentureBeat investigation revealed, some of these guns being purchased through Facebook fan pages are ending up on the playgrounds of American schools.
Special Agent Helen Dunkel, with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, called the illegal purchases a fact. Dunkel said, “We are certainly aware social media is being used to sell firearms, and in instances we receive information, whether through confidential informants or other means, we definitely take that seriously and investigate.”
Dunkel said the ATF, which investigates the unlawful use and possession of guns and explosives in the U.S., has multiple ongoing investigations into illegal gun transactions on social media platforms. Citing the ongoing nature of the cases, they declined to specify them. The investigations are being coordinated through the ATF's office of strategic intelligence in Washington D.C.
ATF spokewoman Ginger Colbrun put it this way:
“We definitely see it occurring, and when we do, we open investigations. [Social media] is a new avenue we're looking into. We're definitely taking it seriously.”
A spokesperson at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C., declined to comment for this story, referring all questions to the ATF.
Facebook responds
For its part, Facebook prohibits the sale or trade of guns, weapons, and explosives through the site and company spokespeople routinely remind reporters that they work with law enforcement on a case by case basis. A spokesperson said that any time user policy violations occur, they are dealt with. Facebook also likes to remind people that it's not an e-commerce platform.
Nor is Facebook alone in being used for illegal activity. Sites like Craigslist have also been used in the past to sell weapons, drugs, and sex-for-hire schemes. (Craigslist has responded by banning such content, and by actively enforcing those bans.)
“You can't buy things on Instagram and Facebook, nor can you promote the sale or use of weapons in advertising,” a Facebook spokesperson told us. “We encourage people who come across any illegal activity to report it to us.”
Oddly, buying and selling firearms on Facebook's platform has been going on right under Facebook's nose for far too long to go unnoticed.
In the October 2013 Kentucky case, the boy met the gun seller through a Facebook fan page called Portsmouth Pickers, a page where locals share information on the best fishing holes on the nearby Ohio River, recipes and even trading guns.
Cooper then arrested the seller, a man who drove across the river to sell the gun to the young teen. Because the seller drove across state lines, sold the weapon to a minor and violated federal gun laws, the case was eventually turned over to the feds who indicted him.
As the case unfolded, investigators subpoenaed the kid's and seller's IP logs. They were able to clearly read the Facebook chat logs which led to the illegal sale. During the investigation, Cooper learned something else: The seller had been moving illegal handguns through Facebook channels before.
“Our investigation showed more than just the one 9mm,” the friendly Cooper said during a series of phone interviews.
“In fact, the suspect admitted to me that they were using Facebook to sell weapons. They met this kid, who we determined didn't bring the gun to school to hurt anybody, through Facebook, and they made the arrangements through the site.”
The sheriff said buying unlicensed guns on Facebook is a good way to do it: no paper trail, no registration. Nothing more than cash and a handshake.
“That's how I would do it,” the sheriff said of the illegal Facebook gun buy. “If this thing were to show up at a murder scene, it would be near impossible to trace.”
Quite a few offers
The Facebook page “Firearms Only Alamogordo” is a happening place. Members continually post videos of combat shotguns of the kinds Marines used to clear trench lines in World War I, Chinese-made semiautomatic AK-47 assault rifles with 30 round banana clips, and Ruger 9mms. The page is moderated by someone who identifies themselves an active member of the U.S. Air Force.
The page has a prominent policy prohibiting the sale of guns to minors.

On a recent thread (right), a flame war erupted between a man who met up with someone they thought was an adult, for the purchase of a rifle. When they showed up, they were met by a minor who opened the door to the trunk of their car to reveal a small arsenal of weapons. When the prospective buyer asked the seller where their father was, the kid said they were sick.
Another recent thread, started by a junior high school student, asked members there if anybody would trade them a gun for their 30 gallon freshwater fish tank.
There were quite a few offers.
The Menlo Park, Calif.-based social media giant has been under fire by an activist group of concerned mothers called Moms Demand Action and the powerful Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a powerful advocacy group co-founded by billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.
The two groups are demanding that Facebook and Instagram “get out of the gun business.”
A petition on Change.org to prohibit gun sales on Facebook and Instagram has over 75,000 signatures, and was recommended by Sarah Silverman earlier today.
Earlier this week, Bloomberg's group, with 1,100 U.S. mayors aboard and over a million supporters, threw down the gauntlet.
“Anybody can go to Facebook and Instagram and buy a gun online. We're asking them to review their policies. They facilitate the sale of guns in the U.S., said Erika Soto Lamb, a spokesperson for Mayors Against Illegal Guns. They also launched a petition to get Facebook to the negotiating table.
The petition, in part, reads:
Facebook and Instagram are currently being used to facilitate sales and trades of firearms between private sellers. Most of these sales and trades can take place without background checks, meaning that there's no way to stop a Facebook or Instagram user from potentially selling a gun to a felon, a domestic abuser or another dangerous person who would otherwise be prohibited from obtaining a gun. I think of Facebook and Instagram as places to share photos of my kids & family — not as an online market for guns.
It seems to have worked. Facebook and the advocacy groups are currently in discussions about what they can do to curb illegal gun sales through the Facebook platform.
We've not yet heard whether the social network is changing its fundamental policies or how they're enforced.
But if it does, and it succeeds in shutting down social media gun sales, it will make a lot of people in law enforcement very relieved.
Updated Feb. 27 at 12:20pm Pacific: We removed the word “felons” from the introduction to this story, since we report no evidence of felons purchasing guns via Facebook.
The Gun Is Never The Problem: A Guide To Right-Wing Responses To Mass Shootings April 7, 2014 9:57 AM EDT ››› Blog ›››››› TIMOTHY JOHNSON
When a mass shooting occurs, conservative media rush to blame mental health, video games, a lack of armed people present, and even liberal values -- anything but the fact that the shooter was able to get a gun. But the single proximate factor in all mass shootings, and in all gun violence really, is that it is easy for dangerous people to access high-powered firearms. Lack of access to firearms typically makes it difficult for would-be mass murderers to carry out their plans. For instance, experts say mass stabbings are extremely rare in the United States. To the contrary, 69 percent of all homicides are committed with a gun. Of 37 public mass killings since 2006, 33 involved firearms, while the Boston Marathon bombings, an incident involving a car, and two cases of arson accounted for the other four incidents. Furthermore, academic research has linked the easy availability of firearms to homicide. According to numerous studies, "where there are more guns, both men and women are at higher risk for homicide, particularly firearm homicide." Compared to other high income nations which typically more strongly regulate the availability of firearms, the United States' gun homicide rate is 19.5 times higher, leading to an overall homicide rate that is 6.9 times higher. Research has also shown, "across developed countries, where guns are more available, there are more homicides. These results often hold even when the United States is excluded." Following the April 2 shooting at Fort Hood that left three victims dead and 16 others wounded, conservative media have refused to acknowledge the role of easy access to firearms in shootings and have instead claimed mass shootings are caused by video games, mental health problems, the "culture war," and by a deficiency in the number of firearms carried by the general public.
All of these claims are canards. The claim that there is a causal relationship between playing video games and future violence, including mass shootings, has been debunked by academic research. While it is important to limit firearms access for individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others, the existence of a mental health condition alone is an extremely poor predictive factor for future violence. Claims that mass shootings are caused by a liberalized culture are plainly inflammatory attempts at political point scoring. And there is no evidence that locations where guns are not allowed attract mass shooters or that more people carrying guns in public would prevent mass shootings. Additionally, the suggestion that everyone on a military base carry a gun for self-defense has been rejected by a retired four-star general and a Medal of Honor recipient, among other military experts.
Below are examples taken from past mass shootings that show conservative media dishonestly exonerating the role of easy firearm access in gun violence:
VIDEO GAMES
After Fort Hood Shooting, Fox Military Analyst Ralph Peters Cited Video Games As A Reason Mass Shootings Are "Semi-Approved In Society." While appearing on The O'Reilly Factor on April 3, Ralph Peters expressed the belief that because of video games and the Internet, mass shootings have "become almost an act of self-actualization that is semi-approved by society," before adding, "I'm exaggerating." [Fox News, The O'Reilly Factor, 4/3/14]
Fox News Segment Linked Video Games To Recent Mass Shootings In Connecticut, Colorado, And Arizona. During a September 2013 segment, Fox News "Medical A-Team" member Dr. Keith Ablow compared video games to a drug that makes people violent and added, "Guns are irrelevant to this problem." Days later in a column following the September 2013 mass shooting at Washington Navy Yard, Ablow wrote that the shooter "was also reportedly addicted to a drug -- violent video games (which are no different than heroin or cocaine, but potentially more of a public health threat)." [Fox News, America's Newsroom, 9/13/13, FoxNews.com, 9/17/13]
After Navy Yard Shooting, Fox News Linked Seven Mass Killers To Video Games. Fox News host Steve Doocy claimed that the gunmen responsible for six well-known mass shootings, including Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and Columbine, are "all described as essentially being addicted to video games" while a graphic asked, "Link Between Teen Killers & Video Games?"
[Fox News, Fox & Friends, 9/17/13]
MENTAL HEALTH
Fox News Graphic Bizarrely Suggested The "Motive" In The Fort Hood Shootings Was "Mental Illness." The April 4 edition of Fox & Friends made the claim that the military was eyeing "mental illness as motive," but hours later Fort Hood's commanding general said the shooter's "underlying medical conditions are not a direct precipitating factor. We believe that the immediate precipitating factor was more likely an escalating argument in their unit area."
[Fox News, Fox & Friends, The Washington Post, 4/4/14]
After Navy Yard Shooting, Fox News Host Martha MacCallum Scapegoated People With Mental Health Conditions. While discussing the Navy Yard shooting, America's Newsroom co-host Martha MacCallum claimed that we have "become so PC that we do not understand that there are categories of people" who need to be institutionalized. [Fox News, America's Newsroom, 9/19/13]
After Columbia, Maryland Mall Shooting, Fox News Psychiatrist Said "It Isn't The Gun" Before Baselessly Speculating About Shooter's Mental State. When discussing the motive of the shooter at the Columbia mall on Fox News, Keith Ablow said, "It isn't the gun. We have a crisis in terms of mental health care." [Fox News, America's News HQ, 1/27/14 via Media Matters]
One Year After Newtown, Frequent Fox Guest Ann Coulter Claimed That Mass Shootings "Correlate With Not Locking Up Crazy People." In a December 2013 column on their website, Coulter wrote that mass shootings "correlate with not locking up crazy people," then added, "Fixating on guns after a crazy person commits mass murder is like draining the ocean to find a ring you dropped." [Ann Coulter, 12/18/13]
LIBERALS AND POLITICAL CORRECTNESS
After Fort Hood Shooting, Fox News Graphic Linked Attack To "Culture War." During a discussion of the Fort Hood shooting, a Fox & Friends graphic linked the shooting to the "culture war" and asked, "Are Mass Shootings Result Of Changed Society?"
[Fox News, Fox & Friends, 4/4/14]
After Navy Yard Shooting, Conservative Media Falsely Blamed Shooting On Clinton-Era Policy. Even though the policy regulating when and where guns can be carried on military bases was created during the George H.W. Bush administration, Rush Limbaugh and other members of the conservative media used their mistaken belief about when the policy was created to attack President Clinton after the Navy Yard shooting. [Media Matters, 9/17/13]
After Sandy Hook Shooting, Rush Limbaugh Claimed That Mass Shooters Are All Liberals Before Saying, "I Take That Back." Before taking it back, radio host Rush Limbaugh said of mass shooters, "[t]hey all are liberals. If they're mentally disturbed," when discussing the Sandy Hook shooting. Additionally, Fox News host Mike Huckabee said the shooting happened because "we have systematically removed God from our schools," NRA board member Ted Nugent blamed the shooting on "politically correct culture," and a National Review Online writer said the attack was caused by a "feminized setting." [Premiere Radio Networks, The Rush Limbaugh Show, 12/21/12, Fox News, Your World with Neil Cavuto, 12/14/12, Media Matters, 12/19/12]
After Virginia Tech Shooting, Conservative Commentators Blamed Mass Shooting On "The Wussification Of America" And "A General Culture Of Passivity." On Fox News, conservative writer Mark Steyn said "part of the problem" that led to the Virginia Tech shooting in 2007 "is a general culture of passivity." Then-conservative talk radio host Neal Boortz invoked "the wussification of America" when discussing the behavior of the victims of the shooting. [Fox News, Your World, 4/19/07 via Media Matters, Media Matters, 4/18/07]
NOT ENOUGH GUNS
After Fort Hood Shooting, Fox News Host Martha MacCallum Suggested That "Lives Could Have Been Saved" With More Armed Individuals. On the April 3 edition of Fox News' America's Newsroom, co-host Martha MacCallum claimed, "in every one of these cases, what stops these shooters, is another person with a gun who stops them. I mean, we know that. So in this case, if other people had been armed on that base ... it's highly possible that some of these lives could have been saved." [Fox News, America's Newsroom, 4/3/14]
After Navy Yard Shooting Conservative Commentators Falsely Characterized Facility As A "Gun-Free Zone" That Invited Attack. Even though guns can be carried on military bases by authorized persons, MacCallum, Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich, and CNN host S.E. Cupp all suggested that easier availability of guns in the Navy Yard facility could have prevented the shooting. [Media Matters,9/16/13]
After Aurora Movie Theater Shooting, Glenn Beck Claimed Shooter "Wouldn't Have Gotten Off More Than Four Shots" If Armed Individuals Present. Talk radio host Glenn Beck claimed of the movie theater shooting in Colorado, "If people had a gun in their back and they were -- and they were licensed to carry it, that guy wouldn't have gotten off more than four shots." Their guest Ted Nugent added, "But dear God in heaven, doing nothing is not an option. Training, having a firearm to neutralize an evil gun maniac is a way to go, and we train for that. And I wish I would have been in the theater that day." [The Blaze, The Glenn Beck Program, 7/26/12, via Media Matters]

Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), chairperson of the House Intelligence Committee, told Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work at a committee hearing on Thursday that the Pentagon plagiarized documents submitted to Congress from Wikipedia.
The documents that Nunes referenced were presented to the chairpeople of the House Intelligence, Armed Services, and Defense appropriations committees on March 21.
"Are you familiar with Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia?" Nunes asked Work, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Marcel Lettre, all of whom testified on how the intelligence community can better support the Pentagon.
All three men said they had heard of Wikipedia.
Nunes then reminded Clapper and Work of a March meeting the three of them had with other committee chairpeople. The meeting was held to discuss the Pentagon's determination that a joint intelligence center should be built at the Croughton Royal Air Force Base in the United Kingdom rather than the Azores, a Portuguese island chain. During the meeting, Work presented the members of Congress with documents arguing why this was the best decision to make.
Nunes has argued for months that putting the intelligence center in the Azores would be much less expensive than in the U.K.
"Are you aware that significant portions of this document that you passed to three committee members chairpeople to meet public law were plagiarized from Wikipedia?" Nunes asked Work.
The decision for the intelligence center's location was required by the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.
"No, I did not know that the information in that document came from Wikipedia," Work said.
Holding up the documents in question, Nunes explained that the information and graphs used were copied from Wikipedia.
"I'm just alarmed, Secretary Work, that we would rely on Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia, that is famously known for most high school students for plagiarizing their homework," Nunes said. "That the Department of Defense would even use Wikipedia, a free online service, to provide any information to Congress to put in any report."
"This had no bearing on my determination or my certification, which was required by law," Work responded.
"So you're not bothered at all that the Department of Defense, that anyone in your department would be providing you information to give to the Congress that was plagiarized?" Nunes asked.
After a brief back and forth, Nunes asked, "We need to know whether or not it's appropriate to take information off Wikipedia and provide it to the Congress?"
"I would say that I'm surprised this comes directly from a Wikipedia page," Work said.
Earlier during the hearing on Thursday, Clapper announced that they had resigned the prior night as the director of national intelligence.
WEST BRIDGEWATER – A search for a 53-year-old man missing since March 11 ended Saturday morning when police located their body.
Thomas Stone's body was located in the West Meadow Pond conservation area, said West Bridgewater police Lt. Victor Flaherty.
Their body was found about 100 yards off a dirt path, Flaherty said.
"Preliminary findings by investigators revealed their death wasn't accidental or suspicious in nature," Flaherty said.
Stone's body was taken to the state medical examiner's office to confirm the cause of death.
A West Bridgewater police officer noticed Stone's locked Ford Expedition parked near the pond on March 11. One of the people who reported them missing spoke to them about 11:45 a.m. Friday.
Over the following week, dozens of police, firefighters and a search and rescue team looked for Stone in the area, but were unable to locate him. The search was led by the West Bridgewater police and fire departments, with assistance from the South Eastern Massachusetts Law Enforcement Council.

On Wednesday, investigators said they were suspending the search without any new information.
But police posted on social media Friday morning that several police dogs would be out in town Friday and Saturday mornings searching again.
Flaherty said the town's K9 unit was leading a training Friday and decided to bring several other dogs to the pond area and other places in town to search.
On Saturday, residents, family and friends of Stone were able to assist in the search for the first time. About 40 volunteers assisted and they were able to check additional areas with law enforcement officials.
With a detailed search plan, Stone's body was found off the dirt path about 9:40 a.m.
Attempts to reach Stone's family were unsuccessful Saturday.
"The department and the community at large are saddened at the outcome of this event, but are grateful that we were able to recover the body to bring closure to the family," Flaherty said.
A proverbial pigeon tossed among the kitties: former Canonical employee Jono Bacon has suggested that Ubuntu Phone should ditch Debian …for Android.
Say what?!
The full article, which Jono themselves says is based on a somewhat limited technical understanding of the phone and could be ‘total nonsense', is a fun conjecture.
The core thrust: “Scopes offer a way of getting access to content quickly, they don't completely replace apps. There will always be certain apps that people are going to want. The common examples are Skype, WhatsApp, Uber, Google Maps, Fruit Ninja, and Temple Run,” Bacon writes.
‘To solve the ‘app gap', Bacon suggests Ubuntu Phone become an Android fork.'
“New platforms usually solve this […] by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay those companies to create and support a port. This isn't really an option for the Ubuntu phone (there is much more than just the phone being funded by Canonical).”
Jono's thought-logical solution to solve this? Use Android's popularity to Ubuntu's advantage; take the platform and, like Amazon, Meizu, Xiaomi and others have done, fork it, rip out Google services and enjoy the rewards.
It would still look, feel and function as an Ubuntu Phone of course but (presumably) lower the barrier to entry for everyone — developers, users and hardware manufacturers.
Quite where that would leave the “single codebase” convergence Canonical is chasing, not to mention Mir, Snappy, etc, is left for the reader to guess. Though Bacon does note that UI convergence could be maintained:
“If Unity is essentially a UI that runs on top of Android and exposes a set of services, the convergence story should work well too, after all…it is all Linux. It may need different desktop, phone, tablet, and TV kernels, but I think we would need different kernels anyway.”
Raising Eyebrows
It's an interesting posit from the former Ubuntu community manager. Though unlikely to result in any dramatic shift on the part of Canonical's engineering team it will surely raise a few eyebrows!
The blog post, despite the person writing it, Is not any indication of a volte face on the part of Canonical.
‘Pressure from Carrier to Support Android'
While rebasing from Debian to Android is a tall ask the question of whether Canonical should at least provide a ‘compatibility layer' for run Android apps, similar to that offered in Jolla's Sailfish OS and Blackberry's in-house operating system, is not.
Indeed, it remains a frequently asked question — not just from users.
A few weeks back we asked Canonical's VP of Mobile, Cristian Parrino, whether mobile carriers interested in shipping Ubuntu Phone had put pressure on the team to add Android app support.
The answer was ‘yes' (Parrino is never anything but wonderfully honest). But the pressure didn't go far. Explaining the Scopes ‘story' to carriers — and remember: what scopes can do today is just part of what's planned for them — won them around.
After all, “Android apps run best on Android,” Parrino added.
But does Ubuntu run best on Debian?
For Bacon: “I honestly think some kind of middle-ground is needed to get into the game, otherwise I worry we won't even make it to the subs bench no matter how awesome our technology is.”

Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia, World Bank Vice-President Cyril Muller announced that the new China-led bank has caused a push for reform, but denied that internal tensions have resulted.
An executive of the World Bank Group announced on Sunday that the organization is experiencing a push for reform with the emergence of the new Chinese bank, but that it has not caused tension between China and other countries within the organization.
"We are getting a strong push to change quickly," Cyril Muller, vice president of the World Bank Group, said at the annual Boao Forum for Asia.

Despite US pressure against joining China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the United Kingdom joined on earlier in March and Australia signed up on Sunday, after being pressured to pass up the opportunity in 2014. Russia announced the decision to join the new bank on Saturday, after initially taking a neutral approach.
"There are groups that blend these sets of interests and this helps build consensus and understanding," Muller said, objecting to the idea that there is emerging tension between China on one hand and the US, Japan and Europe on the other.
"Each of the world's [major financial institutions] learn from each other and I pretty much share the view that starting with a clean sheet of paper is a good idea," they added.
The AIIB is an international financial institution which was established in 2014 at the behest of the Chinese government. Beijing wants to see the bank operational before the end of this year. The authorized capital is expected to total about 100 billion dollars.
© Sputnik / Sergey Guneev Boosting Bilateral Ties: Russia Vows to Join Chinese-led Development Bank
The AIIB includes 27 prospective founding members; Australia, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Switzerland and Luxembourg recently indicated their intent to join the bank. The deadline is due to expire on March 31.
The AIIB is seen by some as a rival to the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which are dominated by developed countries like the United States and Japan.
In light of this, US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said last week that America's “international credibility and influence” is under threat as China seeks to set up the AIIF and draw support from staunch US allies.
The New York Red Bulls opened their 2016-17 CONCACAF Champions League campaign with a 3-0 home win over Guatemala's Antigua. It was a near-perfect start to the group stage for RBNY, who next face a potentially tricky trip to El Salvador to play Alianza.
But that is a future concern. For now, RBNY can enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done.
Three thoughts about the game:
1. Well done, Mr. Marsch
Head coach Jesse Marsch has had to roll with a lot of punches this season: inadequate tactics, injuries, frustratingly inconsistent form from key players. But this was a game in which just about everything went just about right. One imagines Marsch got most of what they were looking for out of this game. No Red Bulls were hurt or sent off. Everyone selected played well. And the team grew in confidence and effectiveness as the match progressed.
Kemar Lawrence's first start since injury derailed their Copa America Centenario went well, and the left back was instrumental in setting up RBNY's second goal, shortly before they were subbed out of the match (unharmed - which was also important).
Gonzalo Veron played a full 90 minutes, looking increasingly fluid and comfortable as the game went on. And their combination with Sacha Kljestan for RBNY's third goal showed an on-field chemistry with their teammates that has been too often lacking for the Argentine DP.
Marsch also got minutes for both Sean Davis and Tyler Adams, who will likely be asked to step up to fill the void left by the injured Dax McCarty. Alex Muyl was a pest all night, and saw their work rewarded with a goal.
And Marsch's every substitution made a positive impact on the game.
It was a good night for RBNY, and for its coach. The best laid plans often go awry. But not on this night. On this night, Jesse Marsch got pretty much everything they wanted.
2. Derrick Etienne's first team debut
Earlier in the day, USL revealed Derrick Etienne at #3 on its list of the top 20 players under 20 in its ranks. In the accompanying profile, Etienne told Scott Kessler that they were looking forward to eventually cracking the RBNY first team starting lineup. The 19-year-old knows it will take a little time:
That's my ultimate goal – to start for the first team...Hopefully I'm doing well enough that the coaching staff feels confident to put me into [first-team] game situations.
Serendipitously, Etienne got their first competitive outing for RBNY on the day that interview was published. They were given 20 minutes at the end of the game to show what they can do - and they did everything but score. Granted, they were playing against a tired, demoralized, diminished (Antigua had been playing with 10 men since midway through the first half) opponent. But Etienne dazzled. Repeatedly.
It wasn't quite the memorable debut it could have been (he had a shot hit the post late in the game), but it was still impressive and a promising sign of what might yet be to come from one of the most exciting attacking prospects on RBNY's books at the moment.
3. Antigua will be challenging in Guatemala
By the final whistle, it was easy to forget that this game had started as a relatively even match-up. In the early stages of the first half, Antigua gave as good as it got, and arguably had the better chances. Ryan Meara made some very important saves to keep the visitors off the scoresheet. RBNY's opening goal was a somewhat freakish deflection off Alejandro Galindo's back.
Sixto Betancourt's 26th-minute red card turned the game decisively in the home team's favor. And Antigua's decision to sit back and concede possession in the second half gave RBNY license to run rampant. The Red Bulls made home and numerical advantage count. But they will also know that Antigua will probably not be so easily subdued in Guatemala.
The return match against Antigua will be RBNY's last of the group stage. If it counts for something for both sides, the Red Bulls would be well advised to send out a strong lineup.
A former Fairfax County sheriff's office employee faces two charges of petty larceny in connection with shoplifting incidents at a Target store in Leesburg, Virgina.
WASHINGTON – A former Fairfax County sheriff's office employee faces two charges of petty larceny in connection with shoplifting incidents at a Target store in Leesburg, Virgina.
Leesburg police obtained two warrants against Robert H. Palmer Jr., 50, Leesburg, according to a news release.
Palmer accepted the warrants at the police station.
After being taken before a magistrate, they were released on $5,000 unsecured bond.
They will be back in court on Aug. 12 in Loudoun County.
A conviction on each misdemeanor could result in a 12-month jail term and a fine of up to $2,500.
The charges stem from an alleged May 27 theft.
Target security officer Dallas Northington says they were fired after reporting the theft to Leesburg police. They were told they violated store procedures by not filling out paperwork before contacting police, according to the Associated Press.
The sheriff's employee, who was unnamed at the time, retired several days after the theft was reported, the AP reported.
Leesburg police quickly identified the suspected thief as the sheriff's deputy and contacted the Fairfax County Sheriff's Department May 30.
The Loudoun County Commonwealth's Attorney's office was waiting to know whether Target would seek charges before proceeding with a criminal case, according to Leesburg police.
Police also say they were not involved in Target's decision to fire Northington.
Northington told The Washington Post that they responded to the shoplifting case the same as any other case. They filed a police report and provided the surveillance video. They also say that a supervisor at the store recognized the suspect.

A nursery worker was left with broken ribs after they were kicked to the ground and slashed with a Stanley knife by three women chanting ‘Allah will get you'.
Karrien Stevens, who runs Little Diamonds Nursery in Hermon Hill, London said a member of staff was punched, kicked and slashed with a ‘Stanley knife' while on their way to work this morning.
The victim, named as Katie, was walking down Wanstead High Street, in north-east London, when they were set upon and knifed, according to their boss.
They were attacked from behind and then stabbed in the arm as their assailants chanted ‘Allah', however police are not treating it as a terrorist incident.
Nearby schools sent out emails telling parents they were on ‘lockdown' after the attack at about 9.30am.
The nursery boss said the victim, who is in their 30s, described the attackers as ‘Asian girls'. They ran off when a man came to the rescue and walked them to their workplace.
‘After it happened they were very shaken up, very emotional, but she's in hospital now,' Ms Stevens said.
‘She's had stitches and had some cracked ribs but she'll be fine, she's going to be discharged later today.'
Ms Stevens said they believed the attackers were strangers and the assault was unprovoked.
They said: ‘It was just a random attack, they were walking down by the station and they came up behind them and attacked them
‘She described it as a Stanley knife that they used to slash their arm from their wrist to their elbow.
‘She wasn't wearing a school uniform or anything to provoke anyone, they have idea why they did it.'
They added: ‘When they got to work we couldn't believe it and called the police straight away. It's terrible, I'm absolutely horrified. You don't expect something like this to happen on your doorstep.'
A colleague, who did not want to be named, said the victim had ‘three Asian girls behind them chanting the Koran and ‘Allah”.
They added: ‘They pulled them to the ground, punched her, kicked them One of them pulled out a knife and cut their arm from their wrist to their elbow. The police turned up, the [paramedics] cleaned their wounds up.
‘She's okay, considering. Obviously it's a shock, she's in shock. They were in tears and they had a cut right up their arm.
‘Her stomach was hurting, they had marks all over her, their hair was pulled out.'
The victim, described as a white woman, was attacked by the three girls ‘dressed all in black' less than 10 minutes' walk from the nursery.
Paul Ashmore, 31, a mixing and mastering engineer in South Woodford, said their fiancee and child were held on lockdown at Wanstead Church School, a 30-second walk away.
They said their fiancee called them to say the school was not allowing anyone to leave ‘because there was a stabbing outside', and added that the police did not know ‘where the persons who did it were'.
They were initially told it was gang-related, they said.
‘My instant thought was to collect my fiancee and kid and get them to safety not knowing the full extent of what was happening. But I was thinking the worst.
‘I instantly, after what has been happening regarding terrorists, thought the worst and informed them I will drive up to collect them,' Mr Ashmore said
A Metropolitan Police spokesperson could not confirm if the force were investigating a hate crime or whether the attackers were known to the victim.
The nursery boss described the attackers as ‘Asian girls' and said they ran off when a man came to rescue and took them into work
They added that the Met's Counterterrorism Command was aware of the assault but is not investigating ‘at this time'.
Officers drove the victim around the area in an attempt to find the perpetrators but no arrests have been made.
A spokesperson for the London Ambulance service said: ‘We sent an ambulance crew to the scene, arriving in under six minutes.
‘We treated a woman and the scene and took them to a hospital in east London.'

Feb 10, 2015; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; New York Rangers left wing Rick Nash (61) lines up before a face-off during their game against the Toronto Maple Leafs at Air Canada Centre. The Rangers beat the Maple Leafs 5-4. Mandatory Credit: Tom Szczerbowski-USA TODAY Sports
With Rick Nash possibly on their way out of New York and onto the trade market, there's a unique question surrounding the Edmonton Oilers. With them looking to strengthen their defense, and get rid of a couple of pieces on the forward lines, should they go for them on the cheap?
“The Sportster” was the first to bring up this rather interesting rumor of a possible deal between Edmonton and New York, which included Nash in exchange for RW Nail Yakupov, who wants off the Oilers and reportedly requested a trade earlier this season.
This would be a steal for the Oilers if it were to even happen. First off, Yakupov is clearly not going to improve in Edmonton. We've seen their struggles, demotions and promotions and obviously troubles with management. They have not developed properly and needs a new landscape to at least attempt at reviving their NHL career.
Nash is a winger who has the potential to net 40 goals a season and brings a lot more to Edmonton than fans wuld think. Sure, he's a veteran, but he's only 31. They bring size and speed, standing at 6-foot-4 and coming in at 220 pounds.
The former Columbus Blue Jackets captain is usually in the 30-goal range, and has accomplished the 40+ feat three times in their career. However, after a not-so-impressive 15 goals and 21 assists through 60 games with the Rangers this season, as well as struggling greatly with the team as a whole, it looks like they could be looking at a new team.  They are also excellent when it comes to possession and backchecking, having a 51.1 Corsi percentage. In the playoffs, that percentage increases by two.
Obviously, Edmonton's priority this off-season will be defense, but if they are willing to give up Yakupov along with a couple of picks, they could have a good chance at getting someone like Nash.
Especially if the Oilers take the trade path of getting rid of core players that are wingers (i.e. Jordan Eberle or Nail Yakupov), they will need to replenish their offense. The only problem is, Nash shoots left.
However, it wouldn't be too much of an issue, and they could be a great addition to the second line, or even the first. With their scoring ability, they could work with players like Connor McDavid and become one of the biggest offensive threats on the Oilers roster in years.

A set of bills to give cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, legal grounds is being prepared by a South Korean lawmaker, a long-awaited move to protect South Koreans from potential risks in transactions.
Rep. Park Yong-jin of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea said in a release Monday they would introduce three revisions in July to build a set of regulatory frameworks for digital currencies.
Under the bill that aims to revise the Electronic Financial Transactions Act, traders, brokers, or other business entities involved in cryptocurrency transactions would be required to get regulatory approval from the Financial Services Commission. The requirements include the retention of capital of at least 500 million won ($436,300) and data processing facilities.
Also, revisions to the laws on income tax and corporate tax would allow financial authorities to tackle tax evasion from the digital currency transactions.
(Bloomberg)
In the proposal, Park cited the need to address “the void of a state-led protection that guarantees digital currency's value,” “digital currency's nonexchangablilty to other existing currencies” and “the possibility of wreaking havoc on national economy from digital currency bubble burst.”For the past two years, bitcoin worth 1.92 trillion won was traded, according to data from digital currency market tracker Coinass. The data also showed the number of transactions of bitcoin in 2016 rose by 17.1 percent from 2015.Coinass, which is privately owned and the only market tracker, has tracked bitcoin transactions and closing prices since 2015, and ethereum transactions since October 2016. But local cryptocurrency transactions are not still fully tracked, Park noted, adding the government control is in need.Moreover, virtual currency trading platforms in Korea, including Bithumb, Korbit and Coinone, taking up 75.7 percent, 17.6 percent and 6.7 percent in the market respectively, have no legal grounds for their establishment, according to Park and the Financial Supervisory Service.Experts hailed the move, which came in line with Tokyo's fresh set of bitcoin regulation introduced in May. Putting digital currency under state control is translated into “removed uncertainties” and “boosted transparency,” said Kim Kyung-hwan, head attorney of law firm Minwho.“User protection, tax evasion and money laundering have long been issues in terms of digital currency transaction,” Kim told The Korea Herald. “Digital currency traders have often found themselves in trouble, because they are out of a legal boundary.”South Korea's local currency had the fourth-largest bitcoin exchange trading volume from April 1 to June 10, according to data from Cryptocompare. More investors tend to flock to virtual currencies due to skyrocketing trade prices, while some, including lawmaker Park, compare the cryptocurrencies with tulip, whose price bubble burst rattled the European nations.By Son Ji-hyoung (consnow@heraldcorp.com)

On Thursday, a television host and a sports broadcaster for Los Angeles' KABC Leann Tweeden accused Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) of groping and kissing them without their consent in 2006.
This is the most recent allegation of sexual misconduct embroiling powerful men in media and politics in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) said that they were aware of two members of Congress who have engaged in sexual harassment, noting that one was a Republican and one a Democrat.
On KABC's website, Tweeden wrote they were a part of a group of performers headed to Afghanistan to entertain US troops stationed there. Sen. Franken, who was a comedian at the time, had written a skit that included a kiss with Tweeden. After badgering them to rehearse the skit before going on stage, Tweeden says that Franken forcibly kissed them Later, on the flight home, an unknown person took a photo of Franken groping Tweeden while they slept.
Sen. Franken issued an apology after the allegations were published. “I certainly don't remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann.” they said. “As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn't. I shouldn't have done it.”
Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is calling for an Ethics Committee investigation into Sen. Franken. “As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter. I hope the Democratic Leader will join me on this,” they said. “Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable—in the workplace or anywhere else.”
Democrats have also joined in calling for an investigation into their colleague. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said that they believe the victim; Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) called their behavior “unacceptable” and says McConnell's call for an investigation “has merit.”
Hours later, Sen. Franken issued a longer apology saying they were “disgusted” with themselves and would cooperate with an ethics investigation.
If the cops don't show up, what's a worried neighborhood to do? As cash-strapped, crime-challenged cities like Detroit, L.A., Atlanta, and Oakland face continually dwindling budgets and smaller police forces, there's been a trend of both wealthier and middle-class neighborhoods banding together to hire their own private security patrols to fend off crime. In Oakland, this is now the case in the Crown Ridge, Sequoyah Hills, Parkridge, Maxwell Park, Montclair, and Oakmore neighborhoods, where neighbors have formed "security councils" and hired private firms to be present where the police never are.
The Christian Science Monitor reported on the trend back in April, and now the Chron catches up.
The move has been contagious around Oakland, where crime has soared in the last few years. Oakland laid off dozens of police officers beginning in 2009, but with violent crime rampant in the cities' lower-income neighborhoods, people elsewhere in the city have felt neglected by the OPD. Burglaries are up 40 percent in the last two years, and auto thefts are up 33 percent, as the Chron reports. Anecdotally, neighbors talked about seeing cars "casing" their neighborhoods, something which has stopped since they hired the security patrols. And you may recall this op-ed from a self-described middle-class man who described their constant, "underlying fear" about living in their city  though they advocated a broad overhaul of every aspect of the city's community, rather than more policing.
For neighborhoods that want private security, it works like this: Groups of 45 to over a hundred homes pool resources and pay as little as $15 a month to get a security firm to patrol their streets for a certain number of hours per week. While the OPD and members of city government may not the fact that citizens are having to do this, they seem to welcome the added help.
Sad.

The European Space Agency's Rosetta orbiter — the spacecraft that carried the Philae lander — is still orbiting the comet 67P/G-C, even though Philae's battery died about a month ago.
Now, scientists have used data collected by Rosetta for publicly available research for the first time. In a new paper published today in Science, an international group of led by Kathrin Altwegg has analyzed water molecules released by the comet.
They found that this water doesn't exactly match that of water on Earth, chemically speaking. This is an important clue about how water first arrived on our planet — and could suggest that it's more likely it was delivered by an asteroid, rather than a comet.
Why scientists are so interested in comet water
Earth, unlike any other planet in our solar system, is covered in water. This seems quite normal to us, but for scientists, it's a bit of a mystery — because our understanding of Earth's early history suggest that any water originally present should have evaporated away, due to the extremely high temperatures and lack of a thick atmosphere.
The origin of earth's water is a scientific mystery
A few hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mystery, and the leading two both involve cosmic collisions. One holds that billions of years ago, impacts from comets (chunks of ice and rock that travel around the sun in extremely elliptical orbits) delivered the water we drink today. The other holds that impacts from asteroids (chunks of rock and metal that orbit the sun in more circular orbits) were responsible.
The chief way of testing these ideas is to examine the water that's actually present on comets and asteroids and seeing if it chemically matches the water on Earth. A few spacecraft have previously done this for other comets and asteroids, and found that a couple of comets — along with most asteroids — are a match. Analyzing the water on comet 67P/G-C was one of the Rosetta mission's main objectives.
What Rosetta discovered about this comet's water
On Earth, the vast majority of hydrogen in water (about 99.98 percent) is totally normal: a single proton with a single electron orbiting it. However, a very small percentage of hydrogen (about 0.0156 percent) atoms are in an alternate form, called deuterium. These hydrogen atoms also have a neutron in their nucleus, as well as a proton, giving them a bit more mass — which is why they're sometimes called "heavy hydrogen."
Because water on Earth has a consistent ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen, it's expected that, if comets or asteroids were responsible for bringing water to Earth, their water would have a similar ratio.
Using an instrument mounted on the Rosetta probe called ROSINA, the researchers analyzed the water molecules emitted by the comet as it gradually vaporizes, because its orbit takes it closer and closer to the sun.
They found that its water has about three times as much deuterium as water on Earth. "It's probably one of the highest deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios ever measured — the heaviest water in any source or body," Atwegg said during a press conference on the finding.
What this means for the origin of water on Earth
This doesn't rule out the idea that comets first delivered water to Earth billions of years ago. However, it's a data point that makes it seem somewhat less likely, the researchers say.
One key point is that there are two types of comets: There are long-period comets that travel extremely far from the Sun (70,000 times as far away as the Earth, for instance), then come back in towards the center of the solar system in an orbit that takes millions of years. And there are short-period comets that don't go nearly as far out, and have orbits that take only hundreds of years. These two types of comets are believed to have formed in distinct areas of the solar system, and as a result have different compositions.
the data makes the idea that comets delivered water to Earth less likely
Years ago, analysis of long-period comets (also called Oort cloud comets) indicated that their water had much more deuterium than the water on Earth, so the idea that comets had brought water here was largely discarded. But more recent analysis of two short-period comets (103P/Hartley and 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdušáková) found they both had water with strikingly similar amounts of deuterium to Earth water — leading scientists to revive the hypothesis, but specifically with short-period comets.
This new data throws that idea into doubt once again. If short-period comets did deliver water to Earth billions of years ago, then 67P/G-C would have to be a major exception, with water content drastically different than the other ones. What's more likely, the researchers say, is that short-period comets are more diverse than previously thought — in terms of both water content and where they originated in the solar system — and that asteroids, instead, brought water to Earth. (It's also possible that some water was retained within minerals in the Earth's crust, then gradually leaked out over time, but it's considered less likely.)
Most of our data on asteroid water comes from pieces of them that have fallen to Earth as meteorites — and analysis indicates that their deuterium levels match those of Earth water. But theoretically, this data could be contaminated as they descend to Earth, so firsthand data from an orbiting asteroid would be a better test.
That's where Japan's Hayabusa-2 mission, launched earlier this month, comes in. In 2018, the probe will arrive on an asteroid, and if all goes as planned, it'll bring the first substantial asteroid rock sample to Earth in 2020. By analyzing this sample and other data, researchers will be able to further test the hypothesis — and determine whether asteroids are responsible for all water on Earth.
Other Rosetta and Philae updates
During the press conference, Altwegg and Matt Taylor, a Rosetta scientist, provided a few other updates on the mission:
As the book of Genesis tells it, God had no sooner made a covenant with the survivors of the Flood, agreeing that They would never again try to drown humankind, than they did something new to annoy Him. Settling on a Mesopotamian plain, they made bricks and mortar, and began building a tower whose top, as they planned it, would reach to Heaven—that is, to where God lived. God did not fail to notice what they were doing:
And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined doing. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
According to Esther Schor, in their new book, “Bridge of Words: Esperanto and the Dream of a Universal Language” (Metropolitan), this famous story, of the Tower of Babel, represents a sort of second original sin. “If mortality is what it is like to live after Eden, misunderstanding,” they write, “is what it is like to live after Babel.” This is not just a psychological misfortune but, more pressingly, a political one. Because we don't speak the same language as our neighbors, we can't see their point of view, and therefore we are more likely to rob them and kill them.
For thousands of years, people have taken this matter quite seriously. Ambitious organizations such as the Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church made sure that their members, whatever their mother tongue, learned a second, common language. More recently, various thinkers have considered constructing universal languages from scratch. Schor gives a colorful summary. In the seventeenth century, Francis Bacon proposed that our written language switch to something like Chinese ideograms, bypassing words altogether, and John Wilkins, the first secretary of the Royal Society, proposed a new language with two thousand and thirty characters. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz said that we should use a pictographic system, a little like Egyptian hieroglyphs. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries came the rise of nationalism and, with it, linguistic nationalism, which held that the particularity of language was in fact an advantage, not a problem. Johann Gottfried Herder claimed that a people's language contained its spiritual essence. Wilhelm von Humboldt believed that language, mediating between the mind and the world, actually created a people's identity.
The language called Esperanto was born of such considerations, and one more—the so-called Jewish question. Esperanto's creator, Ludovik Lazarus Zamenhof (1859-1917), a short, sparkly-eyed, chain-smoking ophthalmologist, was a Jew, and, as they wrote to a friend, this made all the difference: “My Jewishness has been the main reason why, from the earliest childhood, I gave myself completely to one crucial idea . . . the dream of the unity of humankind.”
By this they may have meant that Jews were broader in outlook. In any case, they felt that they needed to be. In the town where Zamenhof grew up—Białystok, now in Poland but at that time part of the Russian Empire—the population, they wrote, “consisted of four diverse elements: Russians, Poles, Germans, and Jews; each spoke a different language and was hostile to the other elements.” They went on, “I was brought up as an idealist; I was taught that all men were brothers, and, meanwhile, in the street, in the square, everything at every step made me feel that men did not exist, only Russians, Poles, Germans, Jews.”
In fact, the Russians, Poles, and Germans did see eye to eye on one thing: they all disliked the Jews. In 1881, this sentiment set off a great wave of pogroms in Russia, which, in turn, gave rise to Zionism, the effort to get the Jews out of harm's way by relocating them to what was said to be their promised land, Palestine. Zamenhof was in their twenties when all this happened, and for a while, before devoting themselves to the cause of Esperanto, they were an enthusiastic Zionist. They spent more than two years modernizing Yiddish, converting it to the Latin alphabet, revising the spelling, and constructing a grammar, the first Yiddish grammar ever recorded. (He did this while they were in medical school. Zamenhof was one of those nineteenth-century notables—Balzac, Dickens, Pasteur, Freud, Marie Curie—who seem to have slept only about three hours a night. In their adult years, when they were head of the Esperanto movement, they balanced this with a full-time ophthalmology practice. They also had a wife and three children.)
In time, Zamenhof became disillusioned with Zionism. Indeed, they turned away from all movements defined by ethnic or national identity. “Every nationalism presents for humanity only the greatest unhappiness,” they wrote. They deplored the Jews' claim that God had made a covenant with them exclusively—that they were a chosen people. They wanted Judaism purged of all narrowness. Let the Jews keep some of their nice things, their High Holidays and the stories and the poetry in their Bible. But, as for theology and ethics, they should confine themselves to the teachings of Rabbi Hillel (first century B.C.), which, according to Zamenhof, consisted of just three principles: that God exists and rules the world; that They reside within us as our conscience; and that the fundamental dictate of conscience is that we should do unto others as we would have them do unto us. “All other instructions,” Zamenhof declared, “are only human commentaries.”
The objective of Zionism had been to find for the Jews a safe place, where their separate culture could survive unharmed. Zamenhof's objective was to open up Judaism, so that it would no longer require either separateness or protection. “Instead of being absorbed by the Christian world, we shall absorb them,” they said. “For that is our mission, to spread among humanity the truth of monotheism and the principles of justice and fraternity.” Then everybody could be Jewish!
For this to happen, though, all human beings would need to be able to speak to one another. There had to be a shared, universal language. Hence Esperanto.He started work on it early. At their nineteenth-birthday party, in 1878, they surprised their guests by giving each of them a small dictionary and a grammar of a new language they had invented. They then made a speech in the language, and taught their friends a hymn in its honor:
Malamikete de las nacjes Kadó, kadó, jam temp'está! La tot' homoze in familje Konunigare so debá. Let the hatred of the nations Fall, fall! The time is already here; All humanity must unite In one family.
To Zamenhof's disappointment, most of their friends forgot about their linguistic innovation once they left the party. That was when they drifted into Zionism. But eventually they returned to the project with renewed purpose. In 1887, they self-published their “Unua Libro,” or “First Book,” a primer on the proposed language, with explanatory materials in Russian. It contained a pronunciation guide, a dictionary, and a grammar, plus translations of the Lord's Prayer, an excerpt from the Hebrew Bible, a poem by Heine, and other items. They called the language the lingvo internacia, but people soon began referring to it as Esperanto, after the nom de plume that they had given themselves as the book's author, Doktoro Esperanto (Doctor Hopeful).
They said later that they wanted their language to be “unlimitedly rich, flexible, full of every ‘bagatelle' that gives life to language,” but, above all, they wanted it to be easy to learn, and that is how they promoted it. They claimed that even uneducated people could master it in a week. Maybe they were right, if the people were Western, because Esperanto is closely based on Indo-European languages, or the ones that Zamenhof knew best. Though they eventually acquired almost a dozen languages, their mother tongues were Russian and Yiddish (which is related to German), and they learned German and French at an early age from their father, who was a language teacher.
Esperanto does not stray far from those sources. It has an alphabet of twenty-eight letters, in Latin script. About three-quarters of the words are derived from Romance languages; most of the remainder are based on Germanic languages. The phonology, or sound system, is fundamentally Slavic. The language is very simple. There is almost no distinction between masculine and feminine nouns. With some exceptions, common nouns used as subjects end in “-o” (singular) or “-oj” (plural), and adjectives modifying them end in “-a” (singular) or “-aj” (plural). Most adverbs end in “-e.” Verbs are not adjusted for person or number: “I sing” is mi kantas; “you sing,” vi kantas; “they sing,” ili kantas. Verb endings change with tense, but only once. No matter who sang or will sing—I, you, we, they—the verb is always kantis (past) or kantos (future).
In “Unua Libro,” Zamenhof offered about nine hundred roots, and although they added some more later, Esperanto remains a language with a very small pantry of staples. This frugality, its most basic trait, is then tempered by its second most basic trait, its agglutinative nature—the construction of words by the incessant addition of prefixes and suffixes to the roots. “Jet lag” is horzonozo: hor (“time”) plus zon (“zone”) plus ozo (“illness”). A samideano is a fellow-Esperantist, someone who has the “same idea” as you about Zamenhof's creation. These words can now be found in Esperanto dictionaries, but you didn't have to wait for permission: Esperantists were invited to construct words, and they did. Schor, trading improvisations with another Esperantist, comes up with elmuri—“to take something out of a wall”—for getting cash from an A.T.M.
The compounds give Esperanto a playful, almost childlike, character. (So do some of the roots. “Toast” is toasto.) Something else they call to mind is Dr. Frankenstein's creature, stitched together from so many parts—an ear here, a nose there. Schor, a professor of English at Princeton, is the editor of “The Cambridge Companion to Mary Shelley.” They point out the connection, and they seem to think that Zamenhof may have experienced something like Dr. Frankenstein's amazement when they saw what they had created. They quote a letter in which Zamenhof tells a friend that, in using Esperanto, they eventually stopped translating in their head and began to think in the language. Suddenly, they say, it “received its own spirit, its own life, its own definite and clearly expressed physiognomy.” Oh, my God, it's alive!
As for how it sounded, there have been some rude remarks. William Alden, the London correspondent for the Times, described it as “a sort of Italian gone wrong in company with some Slavonic tongue.” But that was in 1903, when probably no one yet spoke it confidently. If, today, you go to YouTube and listen to people who have spoken Esperanto from early childhood, you will hear something that sounds vaguely Eastern European and, though unmusical, perfectly O.K.
Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse committee believes it has evidence Trump requested putting ally in charge of Cohen probe: report Vietnamese airline takes steps to open flights to US on sidelines of Trump-Kim summit Manafort's attorneys say they should get less than 10 years in prison MORE sold their Cessna jet to themselves to get around a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration issue, The New York Times reported.
The registration for the jet, which Trump had been using to go to campaign events, expired on Jan. 31.

In response, the FAA last week grounded the plane.
But the plane was registered to a new owner on Friday: DT Endeavor I, a limited-liability company registered in Delaware in January and controlled by Trump.
If Trump had instead re-registered their plane, they may have had to face a longer waiting period before being allowed to fly. But because the candidate registered the plane under a new owner, they were able to avoid the normal wait time.
"I haven't flown it, but I can," Trump said in an interview Saturday, adding the issue had been "100 percent" resolved.
They used the jet to get to Rhode Island and Pennsylvania for rallies Monday ahead of the states' Tuesday primaries.
Trump said the registration had expired because the renewal notices were sent to the wrong address.
The plane's new registration expires on April 30, 2019.
Each year I like to take a pause to remember 9/11. After all, it was the false flag inside job terrorist attack that has changed everyone's lives on Earth so dramatically.
This year comes with a little bit extra, however. Like a surprise Christmas eve gift, this year's 9/11 eve came with something even more insane than normal. Nobel peace prize winner Barack Obombya made a special appearance on American TV programming (it's not called programming without reason) to try to plead their case to rain down hell upon innocent men, women and children… somewhere else.
The most fascinating part about what they were saying is that Americans must now support Al-Qaida (Al-CIAda) to kill people in Syria!
Why? Because it's a war on terrorism! That war, by the way, was supposed to be against people like Al-Qaida who, according to the official conspiracy theory (see video below for the story in just five minutes), started the war on terrorism on September 11th, 2001.
Now on the eve of 9/11, 2013, Barack Hussein Obama makes the case for fighting alongside Al-Qaida in Syria. You could never have told me that last sentence ten years ago without me snorting my drink out of my nose. In fact, I have a hard time repressing my chortle at this moment.
How absolutely dumb-downed is the average US populace to even be able to swallow this stuff?
Ed Asner, who I was shocked was still alive, apparently woke up out of their stupor to give a reasonable answer. When asked what happened to all of Hollywood's celebrities who were so adamantly against war when George Bush was the President and why they aren't standing up now, Asner answered, “A lot of people don't want to feel anti-black by being opposed to Obama,” they said.
Well, they shouldn't feel that way since Barack Obama is white. As much as they are black. That is, if anyone has any idea who their real father even was.
But, obviously, if the reason you support someone is purely based on the color of their skin then you are, by definition, racist.
Hollywood and music celebrities like Sheryl Crow, George Clooney, Bruce Springsteen, Sean Penn and Timothy Robbins who were so adamantly pro-Obama and anti-war seem to have just disappeared.
Aside from Obama and Syria and all of today's problems, though, is, what really happened on 9/11, twelve years ago, to start this horror story, cause millions of deaths and more than $5 trillion in expenditures?
If you are one of literally a dozen thinking people in the US who actually use their own brains and still aren't sure the “official story” is full of holes, start here:
If hundreds of facts and evidence aren't enough for you to make you question the “official story” and you are more of a “follow the money” type, then watch this video. It is full of evidence of how it was all done for profit.
If after that you still don't have some doubts, then you may be so absolutely mentally retarded that I don't know how you have even read this far.
But, if by chance you are some sort of engineering or science idiot-savant who does not understand things represented to you that aren't from a scientific perspective, watch this:
If 1,600+ architects and engineers stating that the official story is impossible still isn't enough, ask the hundreds of pilots who say that the official story was not possible at PilotsforTruth.org. Or ask the medical professionals who quetion the official story.
Or if you put your faith in people who work in government services, ask the hundreds of Firefighters for 9/11 truth.
And, if after all of that you don't have any questions at all about the official government story on 9/11 you are such a deeply troubled, brainwashed slave that I highly doubt you've even read this far. But if you have, and after being presented with all this evidence you are not willing to even entertain the fact that you've been duped out of fear that your worldview, since your 12 years of government indoctrination camps and TV programming, is all wrong… then you need to grow a pair and man up.
That all said, there are still many who I know in the freedom movement who will say that it does us no good to keep bringing up 9/11. They know, through evidence, that the official story isn't even close to true, but they say that we are hurting the freedom cause by driving away people who aren't ready for the truth.
Well, I say they are ready. And if we can awaken people to the truth of what happened on September 11th, 2001, and they realize their own government is the terrorists, as Obama is showing today in Syria, and that there is an urgent need to get away from the worst of these governments, we will witness a massive human awakening that will rid us once and for all of all big government and we will eventually have smaller and smaller government until we reach euphoria and we have seven billion governments on Earth.
And, I'll never stop bringing it up, every September 11th, until they do. Never forget 9/11.

The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney, is leading the defense of Senate Bill 5, Ohio Gov. John Kasich's anti-collective bargaining law passed last year. Ohioans were so upset with the law they launched a million-signature effort to repeal the law that will go to voters in the state on November 8. A "no" vote would repeal the law.
Cheney's mailers have included phrases like, ““YES on Issue 2 will get POLITICIANS to Do The Right Thing on Spending” And “OBAMA wants us to do things Theirs WAY? Yes on Issue 2 is our chance to do things OUR WAY” — convenient talking points that leave out the overall message that many Ohioans are getting a raw deal with Senate Bill 5 and Issue 2 is the public's chance to wrong a right. The tactless tactic of invoking President Obama, who has literally nothing to do with this matter, displays the desperation of the Right's effort. In the opinion of some, the bigger wrong that needs corrected is the election of Kasich.
Cheney's ads are notable for their failure to be completely accurate:
Cheney's group began last month to flood Ohio with deceptive mailings that claim “voting yes on Issue 2 will give our communities the ability to get spending under control without raising taxes.” A mailing that just went out statewide declared: “We just can't afford to pay 100 percent of government employee benefits too.” “In this tough economy,” the mailing continues, “it's just not fair to ask taxpayers to pay even more for salaries and benefits for government employees.” Voting yes on Issue 2, it says, “means that government employees will make modest contributions to their benefits” by paying “at least 15 percent toward their health insurance coverage” and “just 10 percent toward their own retirement.” A Cleveland Plain Dealer PolitiFact Ohio review of the mailing concluded that it was “problematic” because the piece “leaves out important details needed to put the statement in context.” Ultimately, the analysis concluded that the Cheney mailing rated “Half True” on its “Truth-O-Meter.” But it's worse than that. The real lie is one of omission. What the Cheney mailings don't say is that the law undermines basic labor rights, eliminates effective collective bargaining and encourages communities to balance budgets on the backs of firefighters, police officers and teachers. Nor does Cheney mention that the cuts will undermine public services and public education at a time when Ohio cities have been rocked by factory closings and rising unemployment.
Ad odd twist to the story is that Cheney's father once worked as a union lineman as part of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
Developer Toby Fox has just released a free PC demo for their RPG about a little girl lost in the underground world of monsters.
Undertale is a quirky little PC RPG about a little girl falling into the underground world of monsters. Its 16-bit style is very heavily influenced by SNES-era RPGs like EarthBound, but with its own unique writing style and gameplay mechanics. You can download a free PC demo from Fox's website, and if you are feeling generous after playing it, you can buy the game's soundtrack for just $1.
In Undertale, you must fight your way through a series of puzzle rooms in the underground monster world, with the guidance of friendly mother-figure Toriel. The puzzles are your standard RPG fair, but the atmosphere they are presented in is really well crafted. The game also features a beautifully drawn opening cutscene. The background music is a mix of chiptunes and soft orchestral instruments that really helps set the scene. It's all rather impressive considering it was made by just one guy.
undertale screenshot 1 undertale screenshot 1 undertale screenshot 1 undertale screenshot 4 undertale screenshot 5 undertale screenshot 6 undertale screenshot 7 undertale screenshot 8 undertale screenshot 9 undertale screenshot 10 undertale screenshot 11
The combat is where Undertale tries to set itself apart from other RPGs. You attack by pressing X or Enter when a fast moving needle is on the largest portion of an Oval, dealing more damaging depending on how skillfully you stop the needle. Enemies then counter-attack in a sort of bullet-hell shooter style, putting you in control of a heart that represents your character's soul as you try to avoid the projectiles. It's a little difficult to explain but it works well and is pretty fun.
There's no word on when the full version will ship, but the website seems to indicate that a Mac version of the demo is coming soon.

The cheesecake may soon stand alone.
With experts and analysts and reporters making it clear that no quarterback in this class is worthy of a top-10 pick, the Raiders could be pouncing on West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith with the third overall selection.
Chris Mortensen of ESPN reports that there are rumors of the team's interest in Smith, who by virtue of the fact that they were the fastest quarterback in Indy makes them an obvious candidate to play for the Raiders.
If the Raiders take him, Carson Palmer likely would be cut. And if Terrelle Pryor remains as the backup, the Raiders would become the first team to go two deep with mobile quarterbacks — which would allow them to run the same offense with either guy. Unlike the Redskins or the 49ers or the Panthers or any other team with a mobile starter.
Of course, it all could be a smokescreen aimed at persuading teams like the Cardinals or Bills to trade up to the third spot.
Regardless, the dearth of quarterbacks (as evidenced by the haul the Niners will receive for Alex Smith) will prompt quarterback-needy franchises to do desperate things. A trade up to No. 3 could be the end result.
The Innocence of YouTube
In 2006 Egyptian human rights activist Wael Abbas posted a video online of police sodomizing a bus driver with a stick, leading to the rare prosecution of two officers. Later, Abbas's YouTube account was suddenly suspended because they had violated YouTube‘s guidelines banning "graphic or gratuitous violence." YouTube restored the account after human rights groups informed its parent company Google that Abbas's posts were a virtual archive of Egyptian police brutality and an essential tool for reform. After the Abbas case, Google concluded that some graphic content is too valuable to be suppressed, even where it is most likely to offend.
More recently, the Innocence of Muslims video led Google to bend its rules in the other direction, temporarily blocking the video in Egypt and Libya "given the very sensitive situations in these two countries," according to a statement given to reporters, even though those governments had not requested censorship and it was not violent, graphic, or directly hateful enough to violate YouTube's guidelines banning gratuitously violent images and hate speech. (The video has since been quietly unblocked in both countries.) From the beginning, Google kept the video up in most of the world — and denied a request from the White House to remove it completely, but blocked it in countries including India and Indonesia where it has been ruled illegal, in keeping with Google policy to abide by its own rules as well as national laws.
In the crush of events, Google's decision was the best it could have done under the circumstances. Yet little of the rationale behind Google's decisions has been offered directly to YouTube users. Google has made a laudable public commitment to free expression and does a good job of disclosing how it responds to government demands around the world. Given the Internet giant's power to shape global public discourse, it should be equally transparent about its private governance of global speech.
Sovereigns of cyberspace such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter have no legislatures or courts, yet they are carrying out private worldwide speech "regulation" — sometimes in response to government demands, sometimes to enforce their own terms of service and guidelines. As they attempt this unprecedented feat in a dizzying variety of social and political climates, they will continue to face complex dilemmas. In trying to develop "community guidelines" for the world, they will be both tempted and pressured to bend them to fit other new circumstances. With so many audiences ready to riot, so many provocateurs looking for excuses, and so many channels of communication between them, the companies cannot be expected to prevent — or take responsibility for — violence provoked by content posted on their services. What they can do, however, is to make a major contribution to both freedom and civility by explaining their de facto "jurisprudence" as it develops, to the public.
While Google does put up explanatory messages to users when a video has been restricted by government demand, it did not have an appropriate message on file for its decision in Libya and Egypt. For the first 24 hours, Egyptian users were shown a message claiming that the video had been blocked "due to a legal complaint by court order." After that, a message simply said "This video cannot be accessed from your country." While the Innocence of Muslims was an exceptional case of ad hoc censorship that must remain very rare if YouTube is to remain a platform for freedom of expression, it is inevitable that similarly urgent and difficult cases will arise in future. When such rare decisions are escalated to high-level executives who must sign off on deviations to standard procedures – as was the case in this instance – the company should consider posting more customized messages. This would have helped to promote the values that Google was attempting to balance.
The message might have read, for example, "This video clip has been temporarily blocked in your country due to a violent emergency, although no content posted by anybody on YouTube ever justifies violence." In the rest of the world where the video remains unblocked, a notice could read, "Some may prefer not to watch this video due to its offensive content, although it does not violate YouTube's community guidelines against hate speech and graphic or gratuitous violence." (There is a precedent for this: Google posted an apology and disclaimer in 2009 when Google image searches for Michelle Obama were turning up a racist caricature as the top result.) Explanations would set a good example of transparency and would contribute to debate about the contours of freedom of expression, especially in countries that are working out their own rules for regulating speech as they make transitions toward democracy, often in volatile contexts.
Google has already developed a robust set of policies and practices to handle government censorship demands, and to inform users about those demands, in its Transparency Report. The report lists requests from governments to block content, including but not limited to YouTube videos, and records Google's responses. It is fascinating reading, by turns amusing and sobering. In 2011 for example, Passport Canada asked Google to remove "a YouTube video of a Canadian citizen urinating on their passport and flushing it down the toilet. We did not comply with this request." Also last year, Google said it had "received a request from the UK's Association of Police Officers to remove five user accounts that allegedly promoted terrorism. We terminated these accounts because they violated YouTube's Community Guidelines, and as a result approximately 640 videos were removed."
Google could expand its Transparency Report to include the decisions it makes of its own accord, whether to remove or block controversial content — and other Internet companies could follow suit. Columbia University Law School's Internet law guru Tim Wu has suggested setting up a community of experts, or of YouTube users, to give advice on tough questions of regulating speech online: a fine idea but decisions to block content must be made very quickly, before they become moot. In practice, Internet companies will probably continue to make their own decisions; outsiders and experts will continue to critique them after the fact.
Companies could invite discussion about their decisions, though, in online spaces connected to their transparency reports — and to the very content that has sparked widespread controversy. Given that this entails a new kind of community platform, and editorial functions that may be incompatible with these companies' roles, discussions could be hosted by a neutral third party.
Such a third-party role has a precedent. Both Google and Twitter now link to the independent non-profit website Chilling Effects, which hosts copies of the "cease and desist" notices and other court orders requiring the companies to remove content from their services. A third-party website run by an international community of netizens who share core values of free expression, non-violence, and empathy between different cultures could curate, and even translate, both mainstream and social media responses to controversial content. These cross-cultural flight attendants could then moderate a global conversation about what sorts of responses are reasonable and appropriate from different cultural perspectives.
Such a space could become a salutary forum for international debate: a gym for the civil exercise of freedom of speech in a world that needs the practice.
Certainly no-one will ever accuse Newt Gingrich of having low self-esteem. Talking Points Memo is reporting that Gingrich's campaign manager Michael Krull has taken to Facebook to vent about the Virginia Republican Party's judgment that the former Speaker of the House did not qualify to appear on the March 6 primary ballot.
“Newt and I agreed that the analogy is December 1941,” they write, comparing the campaign's failure to acquire the 10,000 signatures necessary to compete in the Virginia primary to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. “We have experienced an unexpected set-back, but we will re-group and re-focus with increased determination, commitment and positive action.”
On December 7, 1941, 353 Japanese bombers mounted a raid on American military assets billeted at Pearl Harbor, a Navy base on the island of Hawaii. According to WikiPedia, 2,402 Americans lost their lives, with 1,282 injured. Eight U.S. battleships were damaged, four of them sunk. 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, as well as three Navy cruisers, three destroyers, an anti-aircraft training ship, and one minelayer.
As Raw Story reported earlier, this is the third state primary for which the Gingrich team has failed to collect enough signatures or missed the filing deadline.
Earlier this year, the campaign saw a mass walkout of essential personnel in the wake of what staffers described as the candidate's lack of discipline and inability to focus. Some cited Gingrich's decision to join wife Callista on a luxurious Greek cruise just as the primary season got underway as a typical Newt misstep.
Gingrich remains defiant. According to Krull's Facebook post, “Newt and I have talked three or four times today and they stated that this is not catastrophic – we will continue to learn and grow. Remember that it was only a few months ago that pundits and the press declared us dead after the paid consultants left.”
And that gives us all the excuse we need, really, to re-publish this video in which actor John Lithgow dramatizes a Gingrich campaign press release from earlier this year. Merry Christmas!

Think tanks such as the Cato Institute and the Tax Foundation like to cherry-pick tax data to claim that the rich pay more than their fair share. But a broad look at taxation shows it's not true, a writer at The Economist says.
An earlier article in that magazine had noted that in recent years, the top 5 percent of earners received 32 percent of the nation's adjusted gross income but paid 59 percent of federal individual income taxes. “If that's not giving something back, what is?” the author had asked.
Yes, most of the American income tax code is progressive, meaning that earners with higher incomes are taxed at higher rates. But income tax is only part of the tax picture, and a small part at that, an article in rebuttal to the earlier one explains. In the whole of the U.S., income taxes account for only 27 percent of total government revenue. That leaves three-quarters of the tax pie for which the argument made by the rich man's defender does not hold true. That slice consists of the Social Security payroll tax (from which the wealthy are mostly exempt), along with sales and excise taxes. It's through these taxes that the middle class pays more.
“[T]he American tax code as a whole is almost perfectly flat,” the rebuttal continues. The bottom 20 percent of earners make 3 percent of the income and pay 2 percent of taxes. The middle 20 percent earns 11 percent of the income and pays 10 percent in taxes. And the top 1 percent makes 21 percent of all earnings and parts with 22 percent in taxes.
But that's not how it has to be. We could live in a world where the rich really do pay as much in taxes as the author of the original article probably led many readers to believe.

A rooster crows because they have an internal clock that helps them anticipate sunrise. Like all birds, roosters sing – or crow – in a daily cycle. Almost all animals have daily cycles of activity known as circadian rhythms that roughly follow the cycle of day and night. Roosters anticipate sunrise to get a head start on their daily hunt for food and defense of territory.
But if one rooster in the neighbor has an internal clock that's set a little early, they can stimulate other roosters to crow early, too. The rooster's sunrise song is actually a way of establishing their territory. When a rooster crows, he's sending a signal to other roosters that if they trespass, they're asking for a fight.
A rooster will often crow from a vantage point above their territory so they can make others more aware of their presence and so that their songs travel farther. Even though roosters are the most famous crooners of the chicken world, hens aren't exactly silent, either. When a hen spots a hawk, she'll let out a harsh scream to send their chicks into hiding. But if they see a less-threatening human, they might just cackle.
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — A jubilant President Trump recapped some of their campaign's greatest hits and offered new policy ideas as well as blatant misstatements during a marathon rally Wednesday night in Iowa.
“We're not even campaigning and look at this crowd,” said Trump during a rally organized by their 2020 campaign in a near-capacity U.S. Cellular Center in downtown Cedar Rapids. Trump spoke for 70 minutes in front of an exuberant crowd in their first trip west of the Mississippi as president. They stood atop signs reading “Promises Made” and “Promises Kept.”
During their speech, Trump verified reports that they were unhappy with the health care plan that passed the House, saying that they told lawmakers to “throw money” at health care to come up a plan with “heart.” They made a brief plea for bipartisanship, saying that Democrats wouldn't vote yes even if Republicans came up with a plan that offered the best health care for free, but if the parties worked together they could get “really, really great legislation” passed. They also confirmed a report from earlier this month that they were considering a “solar wall” along the border with Mexico, generating electricity to offset the cost — which would still be borne by Mexico, Trump insisted.

The president also said they would change the law so that immigrants could not receive welfare benefits until they had been in the country for five years. That has already been the United States' policy since 1996.
As Trump got further into the evening they began to riff more, veering off script — and deviating from the truth in the process. They said the Keystone Pipeline would bring 38,000 jobs to the United States, when the actual number of permanent jobs is closer to 35. They said Republicans had gone 5-0 in special elections and specifically mentioned California, a race where the runoff election was between two Democrats. (Of contested races between Democrats and Republicans, the president's party has won all four, although by unexpectedly small margins compared to 2016 results in the same districts.) They said America was the highest taxed nation in the world, when, depending on the metric used, it falls between 17th and 31st.

Trump revisited many of their touchstones from the campaign, and attendees seemed happy to indulge in the memories. Chants of “Build that wall” broke out multiple times during the speech, and the crowd obediently booed mentions of NAFTA and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A mention of Hillary Clinton's campaign ads brought out enthusiastic chants of “Lock them up.” Regarding their own potential legal problems, Trump did not directly mention special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia and the Republican campaign, but they did decry the “phony witch hunt” that they said was targeting him. Apropos of something apparent only to him, Trump also asked “What the hell is going on in Chicago?” a common refrain from the trail. They brought up their campaign announcement from June 2015 and how much people enjoyed the long escalator ride they took at Trump Tower.

They also struck a few new notes. After demonizing Goldman Sachs repeatedly during the campaign, Trump bragged about having the investment bank's former president Gary Cohn as their chief economic advisor, saying that while they loved poor people, they didn't want them running the economy. (“I love all people. Rich or poor. But in those particular positions I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense?” Trump explained.) After targeting China and Saudi Arabia during their campaign, Wednesday night Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping and referred to King Salman of Saudi Arabia as a “very special man,” whom they met on their “monumental, epic trip” to the Mideast. They applauded Saudi Arabia for taking a tougher stance against terrorism, an apparent reference to the kingdom's sanctions against Qatar — a position that puts the president at odds with their own State Department, which is cognizant of the 10,000 American military personnel based in Qatar.
Dear YWN,
I was thrilled to learn that many flights from NY to Florida were cancelled on Erev Shabbos. I was also thrilled to learn that at least two Pesach hotels pulled the plug just a few days before Yom Tov.
Why am I thrilled?
Because I just collected money (more than $10K) for a family whose Flatbush home was slipping into foreclosure and friends got together to save them. So this was a thank you (spit in the face) to those that helped them out. They used credit cards to go to an upscale hotel for Pesach.
Now some may say “thrilled” is the wrong word, and of course it is not my wish that these people lose large sums of money, but yes I am thrilled that maybe just maybe the world will finally be exposed to this sickening phenomenon that is destroying so many families in our midst.
How reckless have we become? When did lose our minds in this insane fashion.
I know of a family that BORROWED $80,000 (yes, you read correctly – 80 THOUSAND DOLLARS) to fly their family to a Pesach hotel across the United States.
These are the same people that borrow money to purchase their summer homes in the Catskills (because you MUST); who take their kids to Miami on mid-winter vacations (because you MUST); who go on a vacation or two a year (because you MUST); who spend Sukkos in Israel every two years (because you MUST)….
So yes, I am thrilled that some people might Nebach have to spend Pesach in their homes. I am thrilled that instead of sharing their most precious family time with strangers, waiters and swimming pools they may enjoy a beautiful and uplifting seder around their very own, plain, boring dining room tables.
K.S. – Flatbush, Brooklyn

REUTERS/Daniel Aguilar Suspected Mexican drug trafficker Vicente Zambada Niebla is presented to the media in Mexico City March 19, 2009.
An investigation by El Universal has found that between 2000 and 2012, the U.S. government had an agreement with Mexico's Sinaloa drug cartel that allowed the organisation to smuggle billions of dollars of drugs in exchange for information on rival cartels.
Sinaloa, led by Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, supplies 80% of the drugs entering the Chicago area and has a presence in cities across the U.S.
There have long been allegations that Guzman, considered the “world's most powerful drug trafficker,” coordinates with American authorities.
But the El Universal investigation is the first to publish court documents that include corroborating testimony from a DEA agent and a Justice Department official.
The written statements were made to the U.S. District Court in Chicago in relation to the arrest of Jesus Vicente Zambada-Niebla, the son of Sinaloa leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and allegedly the Sinaloa cartel's “logistics coordinator.”
Here's what DEA agent Manuel Castanon told the Chicago court:
“On March 17, 2009, I met for approximately 30 minutes in a hotel room in Mexico City with Vincente Zambada-Niebla and two other individuals — DEA agent David Herrod and a cooperating source [Sinaloa lawyer Loya Castro] with whom I had worked since 2005. … I did all of the talking on behalf of DEA.”
A few hours later, Mexican Marines arrested Zambada-Niebla on charges of trafficking more than a billion dollars in cocaine and heroin. Castanon and three other agents then visited Zambada-Niebla in prison, where the Sinaloa officer “reiterated their desire to cooperate.”
El Universal, citing court documents, reports that DEA agents met with high level Sinaloa officials more than 50 times since 2000.
Then-Justice Department prosecutor Patrick Hearn told the Chicago court that, according to DEA special agent Steve Fraga, Castro “provided information leading to a 23 ton cocaine seizure, other seizures related to” various drug trafficking organisations, and that “El Mayo” Zambada wanted their son to cooperate with the U.S.
El Universal A screenshot from the documents published by El Universal.
“The DEA agents met with members of the cartel, in Mexico, to obtain information about their rivals and simultaneously built a network of informants who sign drug cooperation agreements, subject to results, to enable them to obtain future benefits, including cancellation of charges in the U.S.,” reports El Universal, which also interviewed more than one hundred active and retired police officers as well as prisoners and experts.
Zambada-Niebla's lawyer says that in the late 1990s, Castro struck a deal with U.S. agents in which Sinaloa would provide information about rival drug trafficking organisations while the U.S. would dismiss its case against the Sinaloa lawyer and refrain from interfering with Sinaloa drug trafficking activities or actively prosecute Sinaloa leadership.
“The agents stated that this arrangement had been approved by high-ranking officials and federal prosecutors,” the lawyer wrote.
After being extradited to Chicago in February 2010, Zambada-Niebla argued that they were also “immune from arrest or prosecution” because they actively provided information to U.S. federal agents.
Zambada-Niebla also alleged that Operation Fast and Furious was part of an agreement to finance and arm the cartel in exchange for information used to take down its rivals. (If true, that re-raises the issue regarding what Attorney General Eric Holder's knew about the gun-running arrangements.)
A Mexican foreign service officer told Stratfor in April 2010 that the U.S. seemed to have sided with the Sinaloa cartel in an attempt to limit the violence in Mexico.
El Universal said that the coordination between the U.S. and Sinaloa peaked between 2006 and 2012, which is when drug cartels consolidated their grip on Mexico. The report ends by saying that it is unclear whether the arrangements continue.
The DEA declined to comment to El Universal.

President Donald Trump speaks following a visit to the U.S. Central Command and Special Operations Command at MacDill Air Force Base on February 6, 2017, in Tampa, Florida.
The jury is still out on whether there's a grand strategy behind the falsehoods spread by Donald Trump, but on Monday the White House did manage to take one of the president's baseless accusations and use it to their advantage.
President Trump's main justification for their executive order barring refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries is the need to take swift and extreme action to protect the United States from terrorism. On Monday, after several courts blocked the order and journalists pointed out that it doesn't make sense to focus on those groups, Trump tried to preemptively shift the blame for any future terror attack from their policies to the courts and the media.
Then, while speaking to U.S. Central Command, the president suggested that the media is covering up terrorist attacks for some unspecified reason (not unlike President Obama).
“You've seen what happened in Paris, and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening,” Trump said. “It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.”
The remark was reminiscent of Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway's widely mocked complaint that the media didn't cover the “Bowling Green massacre” — which is true, as there's no such thing. Conway claimed they meant to say “Bowling Green terrorists,” referring to two Iraqi men caught trying to aid terror groups back home while they were living in Kentucky. However, Cosmopolitan revealed on Monday that she'd used the term “Bowling Green massacre” before.
While the Conway controversy might have been fresh in their mind, Trump's accusation has deeper roots. For months, the conspiracy-theory website InfoWars has been reporting that the mainstream press is downplaying reports of terror attacks. (A sample headline from July: “SCANDAL: MASS MEDIA COVERS UP TERRORISM TO PROTECT ISLAM.”) And as the Washington Post reports, the general concept predates InfoWars:
Conservatives have long accused the media of obscuring the details and motivations of radical Islamic terrorists in an effort to downplay the role of religion. After Benghazi, the media were often accused of not sufficiently covering the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic outpost – or refusing to label it terrorism.
The press might have stayed focused on why President Trump's suggestion of a widespread media coverup is so dangerous were it not for Sean Spicer “working the refs,” as the Post's Philip Bump put it. The White House press secretary said Trump's vague suggestion that the media “doesn't want to report” on terror attacks was actually a reference to “several instances” in which the media didn't devote enough attention to terrorism.
“He felt members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered,” Spicer said. “Protests will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage.”
Spicer promised to provide specific examples, and hours later the White House put out a list of 78 terror attacks that they claim didn't receive adequate media attention. It included several attacks that drew weeks of extensive coverage, like the killing of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in 2015, the Orlando nightclub shooting that claimed 49 lives last summer, and even the 2015 massacre in Paris that left 129 people dead. Also listed are several incidents that had no casualties, and thus received far less coverage.
The list appeared to be put together hastily, and it was far from comprehensive. There were strange omissions, like no mention of terror attacks in Israel or those carried out by white extremists. And the document includes spelling errors; Denmakr instead of Denmark and the repeated misspelling of attacker as attaker:
White House list of allegedly undercovered Islamist terror attacks repeatedly misspells “attacker.” pic.twitter.com/Im2MPWJr7j — Matthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias) February 7, 2017
White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters pivoted even further from Trump's claim that the “very, very dishonest press … have their reasons” for downplaying terrorism. Rather than suggesting some nefarious motive, they said there were simply too many terror attacks for the press to adequately cover them all.
“The real point here is that these terrorists attacks are so pervasive at this point that they do not spark the wall-to-wall coverage they once did,” they said. “If you look back just a few years ago, any one of these attacks would have been ubiquitous in every news outlet, and now they're happening so often — at a rate of more than once every two weeks, according to the list — that networks are not devoting to each of them the same level of coverage they once did.”
Now, rather than focusing solely on the president's remarks, the media had a bizarre list to pick apart. Some outlets noted that there are valid criticisms to be made about how the media covers terrorism — though Trump didn't make them. Other journalists tried to disprove the assertion by recalling their coverage of incidents mentioned in the list.
Anderson Cooper: I know we covered attacks, I was there https://t.co/W4sYKYqdHF https://t.co/r7BEVkbZ2N — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) February 7, 2017
Most outlets were trying to illustrate that the so-called evidence released by the White House does not back up Trump's attack on the press. However, their discussion might have bolstered their larger point that Americans should be very alarmed about terrorism, even if there's no new incident currently dominating media coverage. It's hard not to be more worried about threats to national security when headlines remind you of the dozens of attacks committed by Islamic extremists, and terrorism is all anyone is talking about.
Ravens veteran defensive end Chris Canty is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts.
Canty didn't practice at all last week because of a knee injury and still started against the Carolina Panthers, but he's regarded as a long shot to play this week.
An illness and a knee injury kept Canty out of practice this week. Only the illness is listed on the injury report, though.
"Depends on whom the player is as far as that goes," Ravens coach John Harbaugh said when asked if a player can play without practicing all week. "The more experience a guy has, the less they need to practice. A younger player needs to practice. That's probably how it works. In the NFL, you have guys who've played for six, eight, 10, 12 years. They know how to play."
Meanwhile, defensive tackle Timmy Jernigan (knee meniscus) and left tackle Eugene Monroe (arthroscopic knee surgery) are listed as doubtful and could just as well be ruled out.
Jernigan is unable to do most activities right now, including driving, according to a source. Monroe had surgery last week and is expected to miss at least a month, according to a source.
Ravens outside linebacker Terrell Suggs is officially questionable with a lingering groin injury, but they practiced on a limited basis Friday and is expected to play Sunday.
Third-string tight end Phillip Supernaw was added to the injury report Friday as questionable with a thigh injury that limited them in practice. Cornerback Chykie Brown (neck) and running back Bernard Pierce (quadriceps) are probable.
The Colts ruled out former Ravens defensive tackle Arthur Jones and rookie guard Jack Mewhort because of ankle injuries. Jones signed a five-year, $33 million contract with the Colts in March that included $16 million guaranteed.
The Colts listed the following players as probable: linebacker Jerrell Freeman (hamstring), safety Colt Henderson (groin), linebacker Andy Studebaker (hamstring) and guard Hugh Thornton (ankle).

When Chinese president Xi Jinping meets with US president Barack Obama at the White House this week, some tension is to be expected.
The global powerhouses are at odds on several of the big issues that must be addressed, such as China's South China Sea ambitions, human rights and cyber warfare. Other issues, such as climate change and economic ructions, will have the two walking on more common ground.
But perhaps the most delicately handled chat will come when someone finally broaches the subject of Xi's quest to bring corrupt officials and businesspeople home from the US to be tried in China. And maybe, specifically, one man.
Ling Wancheng could in some ways be seen as China's Ed Snowden. He's certainly desperately wanted by China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the reason why makes them wanted arguably in equal measure by the US government.
In the past year or two, China has significantly ramped up its crackdown on corruption at home. “Operation Fox Hunt” takes that search for economic fugitives international, and in April, the CCDI posted a top 100 wanted list. 40 were in the US.
To some onlookers, the fact that Ling was not among those 40 could be for two reasons – a) it's not 100 per certain he's in the US, or b) he's a bigger problem.
Who is Ling Wancheng?
Many things. Successful business person, journalist, a noted amateur golf champion.
All that matters to President Xi though is that they are the youngest of five siblings from a very prominent political family from Shanxi province. Two of their elder brothers were members of the Communist Party of China, until recently, when they were expelled.
All three brothers have been under investigation for corruption at various stages since June, 2014.
Where is he?
Ling Wancheng is believed to have fled to the US sometime after the announcement in June 2014 that their brother Ling Zhengce would be investigated for “serious violations of laws and regulations” of the Communist Party.
The earliest reports that they might be in the US were tied to their purchase of a 724 square metre home in California, which they reportedly bought off NBA player Beno Udrih for US$2.5 million. But their new neighbour told media outlets they hadn't seen Ling or their wife since October 2014.
The New York Times reports “several American officials” have confirmed that Ling is in the United States.
Why does Xi fear them so much?
It's actually more to do with Ling's brothers than Ling.
The other brother under investigation, Ling Jihua, rose to become former Chinese president Hu Jintao's personal secretary and protege. But in 2012, their son was driving a black Ferrari when it crashed and they and one of two women in the car with them were killed. Ling Jihua tried to cover up the incident (there was talk of all three being “scantily clad”) and the attention it drew them led to the corruption allegation and accusations they had “accepted huge bribes”.
REUTERS/Jason Lee Ling Jihua was vice chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, 2013.
One of Ling Jihua's alleged crimes is that they obtained “a great deal of the party and state's core secrets”.  They are believed to have passed “a significant amount of classified and top secret information” to Ling Wancheng as leverage.
The problem is, officials don't know exactly what or how much Ling Wangcheng knows about the Communist Party's inner workings, or even if he's willing to share it. But there's another possible motive for China's alleged desperation, and desire to handle this all on the lowdown – Ling may have a list of Chinese spies on foreign soil.
In a recent article, the New York Times suggested that if Ling sought political asylum, “he could become one of the most damaging defectors in the history of the People's Republic”.
How badly is they wanted?
Duowei News, a US-based Chinese political news outlet, claims Beijing and Washington have been through “months” of secret negotiations over Ling.
If Ling does indeed know the locations of Chinese spies, and he's repatriated to the US, Washington will no doubt see that as a huge strategic advantage, and start using it to, according to WantChinaTimes, develop “targeted policies against China”.
Here's what Slate's Joshua Keating had to say about that possibility last month:
“The Obama administration is reportedly in search of ways to retaliate for China's ongoing hacking of US systems, including the alleged theft of millions of Americans' personal data from the Office of Personnel Management last month “It's not clear what [Wancheng] knows, but given what's happened to their family over the past year, they certainly have a motive for spilling the beans, and will likely find a receptive audience.”
Earlier this month, Xi reportedly dispatched Meng Jianzhu, secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, to meet with US Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson, FBI director James Comey and National Security Advisor Susan Rice. According to Duowei's sources, they made this offer:
First, Chinese authorities will forgo chasing down all the illegal assets they have stashed away in the United States, which is said to total around US$600 million. Second, China will agree to take back 25,000 illegal immigrants living in the US.
Wancheng reportedly bought this home off former Sacramento Kings player Beno Udrih. Picture: Google Earth
Has the US found him?
Only the Department of Homeland Security knows the answer to that question. It seems to be taking a hands-off approach to news Chinese authorities are on US soil actively seeking Ling, yet involved in a tense race to see who can catch them first.
US citizen Tommy Yuan told the Wall Street Journal that they were visited several times back in June by “representatives of the Chinese government”. They specifically chose Yuan because their ex-wife, Jane Zhang, may have married Ling.
Around the same time, Ling's former neighbours in California said Homeland Security “agents” came around asking about him.
Since then, no news, so maybe Ling has already been caught.
When the presidents of the two countries meet for the first time on US soil tomorrow, maybe we'll find out.

Detroit Police said five people were shot late Sunday night at a block party on the city's east side.
Gunfire erupted around 9:30 p.m. outside a block party near Gratiot and Whithorn, officers at the scene said. Details were scarce.
The conditions of the five gunshot victims weren't immediately known. Detroit Police spokesperson Cassandra Lewis said early this morning that they had no additional information.
The five male victims -- ages 14, 18, 29, and two 19-years-old -- all received gunshot wounds and were listed in temporary serious condition at a local hospital.
Police closed off Gratiot between Houston Whittier and Jane while they investigated the scene early into the morning.
Detroit Police Capt. Rodney Cox of the city's 9th Precinct said there appeared to have been a large gathering at a party store, where people were celebrating the release of a new album by an unspecified performer. Cox said 2-3 gunmen fired shots from across the street at the crowd, injuring five people, including the 14-year-old boy shot in the leg.
Cox said there were no indications that any of the injuries were life threatening. But the situation appeared to be volatile; even as they were interviewed early this morning, there were shots fired nearby east of Gratiot, and more ambulances arriving. It wasn't immediately clear if those shootings were related to the earlier ones.
Sgt. George O'Gorman says no one is in custody and an investigation is ongoing.
The incident follows a shooting last week that left a 19-year-old gunman dead and 11 other people wounded at a block party.

FaithZette Tim Tebow Tells Americans: ‘Fight Back' Devout Christian wants an end to political corruption
Even Tim Tebow is weighing in on the presidential election this year.
The devout Christian and now Minor League baseball player didn't hold back when it came to the need for Americans to fight back against corruption.

“When the law stops protecting you from the corrupt but protects the corrupt from you a nation is doomed. Fight back!” read Tebow's tweet Monday afternoon.
[lz_third_party includes=”https://twitter.com/TheTimmyTebow/status/795769303161257984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”]
Calling for Americans to fight against those who protect the corrupt, Tebow pretty clearly refers to Hillary Clinton and their political history (it's no accident she's been dubbed “Crooked Hillary” by their opponent). The issue of government corruption has been at the center of the 2016 election cycle.
While Tebow doesn't make on official endorsement of Trump in their tweet, it's clear they believe it's time to “drain the swamp” — and take on corruption in Washington.

This Elliman listing is now online and ready to crush your soul! The realtors are offering this "brand-new alcove studio with three, large, east-facing windows allowing for robust sunlight throughout the day" all for just $1,275/month. What else will you get for your hard earned rent money?
"Floors are contemporary dark-wood, and kitchen appliances are newly-installed, jet-black. Cabinet space is generous. Bathroom is new with rainforest showerhead. The building is a gut-renovated pre-war structure with laundry in the basement and a garden for exclusive use by tenants."
And while the "alcove" may look legitimate with whatever trick photography they used for this listing, the Daily News has a shocking photo spread that tells it like it is with aerial views. Let's take a closer look—the alcove is shown like this in the listing:
And here's what it looks like IRL. Yeah, that slight indentation at the top is an "alcove" in realtor speak now.
All in all the apartment—located at 14 Convent Avenue—is much smaller than the micro units, coming in at 100-square-feet... and that's basically all kitchen (and bathroom... at least there's a bathroom?).
UPDATE: The listing has been taken down, but here's a screenshot we got before it did.
Sanderson is one of at least seven names tied to the lucrative position although political insiders have deemed them a long shot.
The best odds are being given to Mississauga Councillor Frank Dale, who is said to have the support of a bloc of peers led by Hazel McCallion's old nemesis Carolyn Parrish. Dale is also said to have key support in Caledon with Regional Councillor Annette Groves' name mentioned, bringing their support to at least seven.
Former Mississauga councillor Pat Mullin and Shelley White, United Way of Peel CEO, are said to be the other frontrunners. Richard Paterak, ousted from Caledon council Oct. 27, Regional Councillor Gael Miles and Steve Mahoney, who lost to Bonnie Crombie in the mayor's contest in Mississauga, are also names being associated with the job.
The inaugural meeting will be held at Mississauga Convention Centre, 75 Derry Rd. W., starting at 6:30 p.m.
The meeting is open to the public.
Soon after Peel councillors are sworn in, the regional clerk will call for motions to appoint a chair.
Each nomination must be in writing, and moved and seconded by a regional councillor present at the meeting.
The vote for regional chair is open (not by secret ballot) with the nominee requiring a majority of votes to win the seat.
The contest could go multiple rounds until one candidate secures the most support.
The contest to become the next chief executive has been mildly controversial with McCallion delivering a warning shot to Dale and Miles last week for their rumoured candidacy. They criticized a potential scenario where a sitting councillor forces a costly byelection in the event they win the job.
But McCallion's own preferred candidate is also facing some heat.
White, who became an instant frontrunner to replace Kolb after McCallion noted they would do well in the role, has landed in hot water with the United Way for publicly endorsing mayoral candidates in Brampton and Mississauga.
The United Way is supposed to be non-political.
United Way officials are looking into complaints that White broke code of ethics rules for endorsing Jeffrey's bid for mayor on an election flyer. White is also said to have been an active campaigner for Crombie.
John Russo, United Way of Peel chair, said the organization's board is currently looking into the matter and that a decision would be rendered soon.
White has met with Moore, and had another meeting scheduled with Brampton Regional Councillor John Sprovieri last week in an effort to lobby support.
In addition to McCallion's support, which could bring in key votes from Mississauga council, White's endorsements of Crombie and Jeffrey could be reciprocated this evening.
Jeffrey told The News' editorial board recently that they want to see a strong broker at the table to deal with a laundry list of challenges.

Interview Tue Oct 04 2011
Dan Telfer is one of the hardest working people in Chicago: they co-produces Chicago Underground Comedy, their comedy album, Fossil Record, went to number one on iTunes in 2010, and they have performed on stage with some of the most respected comedians of this generation. This weekend, Dan is opening for Maria Bamford at the Mayne Stage Theater, and they recently took some time out of their day to chat with me about comedy, superheroes, nerd culture and the A.V. Club.
You opened for Garfunkel & Oates this past weekend and you're opening for Maria Bamford this weekend: how has working with talent like that affected your perspective and performances?
It has made me terrified of @humblebrag on Twitter. I am very grateful. If I ever make a decent living from this it will be because of the generosity of other comedians who have taken me on the road like Maria and comedy bookers like Chris Ritter at the Mayne Stage. But since you ask specifically about Maria, Ricki and Kate, I will say something to that effect. I hate nothing more than when I'm on the road and I have to open for someone who insults my lack of masculinity the entire time. Two weekends of opening for laser-witty comics who don't play shitty status games with me? Yes please. I mean I can say that about Garfunkel & Oates because we just finished our weekend. Maria might betray me this weekend and just beat the shit out of me with a tire iron in the green room for two nights. Probably not. We'll see.
Will you talk about Pop Pilgrims, and the work you're doing with A.V. Club? How did that series come about? Are you going to pursue more on-camera projects?
Josh Modell approached me because they know me from my stand-up. The A.V. Club has been friendly to me for a couple years now, which by the way is amazing. You will not meet smarter, warmer, funnier nerds. They asked me to send a reel, I was almost going to host the whole thing because their other host dropped out, but then they cleared their calendar a bit and we ended up splitting hosting duties. You can hear a little more about that on their Reasonable Discussions Podcast, episode 6. So I didn't pursue that so much as it pursued me. I have never received a break because I bent over backwards to solicit my soul to a stranger, but I'm "open" to anything. We live in an age where you can create your own podcast or viral video with zero overhead, I'm not even sure what kind of person is a serial auditioner.
You recently got to sing backup for They Might Be Giants. What was that experience like?
It was amazing. They are the nicest dudes. Thank you to the Onion A.V. Club and the guys at Picture Show Films who film their A.V. Undercover series and Pop Pilgrims. Jamie and Brendan at Picture Show were the ones who were shooting Pop Pilgrims with me and were like "Uh, isn't TMBG your favorite band? You know they're coming to the A.V. Club office in a couple months right?" The whole band signed a copy of the Bed, Bed, Bed book for my 3-year-old. You can find both the A.V. Club studio version and the live recreation on YouTube. One of the highlights of my life.
How has doing stand-up affected you as a producer, and vice versa?
Before stand-up I produced sketch, improv, and theater. Every genre of performance has parallel problems. The second a fellow stand-up texted me something along the lines of "I let you in my unpaid show, I think you owe me a spot in yours" I was like, this is the kind of shit that destroyed Clarence Royce on The Wire. I'm not trading favors, you book me if I'm a good performer and I'll do the same for you. So no, when it comes to ChUC I don't even really tell people I'm a producer unless I think they can make ChUC more special and they need to be coaxed for some reason.
Fossil Record was a big success: any plans for a new album anytime soon?
On an OCD level I will always think back on Fossil Record as "the thing I'm proud of but didn't perform thinking it would be a CD." I would love to plan a CD setlist. And I have loads of material I'd love to put on one, more than I could fit really, but I'm still relatively unknown so I'm in no rush.
I had a conversation recently about whether nerd culture is on the rise. Care to opine?
Well Patton Oswalt just wrote a piece for Wired on how nerd culture has met its logical ending and it now needs to be destroyed. I wouldn't want to argue with him, he's too good at making references I couldn't match. But yes, as technology makes the saddest introverts YouTube stars it stands to reason we don't need luddites playing gatekeeper anymore and can take over anything we want. Including culture. It already happened, really. The era of Steve Jobs came and went. We're post-nerd now. Douches need to learn how to manage their fantasy leagues online and all that.
Who would win in a fight: Superman or The Hulk?
Superman, because their powers are broad and impossible to pin down. There could be a solar flare and their dick could turn into a moon-sized piston and hammer The Hulk into hydrogen dust. If you can never burst out of your pants despite growing 20 times your original size you're a bit beholden to physics. But I was always a Marvel guy so I'm kind of just trying to give Superman a backhanded compliment out of ignorance.

Whether it counts on human couriers or someday replaces them entirely, the on-demand food-delivery service Postmates is beginning to recognize that it has plenty of policy battles on its hands.
To that end, the startup has hired one of former President Barack Obama's top aides on innovation and automation: Vikrum Aiyer, who is joining Postmates as its head of strategic communications and policy, they told me in an email. He'll be part of a growing roster of former White House ex-pats taking up residence in San Francisco.
Like many in the on-demand industry, Postmates relies on independent contractors, who aren't guaranteed benefits like health care that are normally afforded to full-time employees. Some couriers dislike that designation, and even filed a class-action lawsuit against the company in 2015. The state of Washington, meanwhile, ordered Postmates in December to pay workers' compensation premiums to about 3,000 of its couriers, a ruling the company has since challenged.
As it battles over benefits, though, Postmates is also exploring whether it can replace some human couriers altogether — a push toward automation that many in the gig economy have contemplated as they seek to reduce their overhead costs.
In Washington, D.C., Postmates teamed up with robotics company Starship Technologies in January to launch a pilot to deliver food by robot. The duo required regulatory approval before they could get going, however, and conversations with other state and federal regulators appear to be on the horizon. (A spokesperson said Monday that robots are definitely on the policy radar, at least.)
Aiyer, for their part, arrives at Postmates from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, where they served as chief of staff to the agency's leader, Michelle Lee. Before that, however, they were a top innovation adviser to Obama who worked on policy areas like self-driving cars and manufacturing.
Germany began their bid to regain the Women's World Cup by putting 10 past the Ivory Coast in Ottawa.
Celia Sasic scored a hat-trick and Anja Mittag netted twice as Germany were 5-0 up inside 35 minutes.
Mittag completed their treble after the break, with Simone Laudehr, Sara Dabritz, Melanie Behringer and Alexandra Popp all finding the net.
"We had judged them to be better than they were today," said Germany coach Silvia Neid.
Germany fell short of matching the record they set with an 11-0 win over Argentina in 2007.
They went on to defend the trophy they won four years earlier, but failed to reach the semi-finals on home soil in 2011.
Now, the team at the top of the world rankings annihilated an Ivory Coast side who, at 67, are the lowest ranked in the tournament.
"We must forget the score from today, forget the negative points, and learn from this," said Ivory Coast coach Clementine Toure. "Playing the best team in the world is also the best way to learn for us."
Germany could have had more had they not wasted a host of chances in a desperately one-sided first half an hour.
Ivory Coast, making their tournament debut, were able to stem the tide for 30 minutes either side of the break and even had chances to get on the scoresheet.
Binta Diakite had a goal ruled out for a foul on German goalkeeper Nadine Angerer and Ange N'Guessan headed over when faced with an open goal.
But as the African side tired, more gaps opened in their defence, and Germany were able to add five more in the final 25 minutes.
Germany meet Norway, who beat Thailand 4-0, on Thursday.
Huma Abedin's mother helped to water down a speech then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave at a Saudi women's college, warning not to mention “political” terms like “freedom” and “driving for women,” new emails show.
Abedin's mother, Saleha Abedin, is a sociology lecturer at Dar Al Hekma, a women's college in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where Clinton spoke to students on Feb. 16, 2010.
And according to new emails obtained by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch as part of their Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, a Clinton speechwriter for the event sought advice and guidance from Abedin's mother in advance.
“Talk to my mom for sure,” Abedin, a top Clinton aide, wrote to speechwriter Case Button on Feb. 12, 2010. “She will have good points for you…”
Abedin's mother responded with a list of “IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER.”
“Do not use the political terms such as ‘democracy/ elections/ freedom.' Do not use the term ‘empowerment of women' instead say ‘enabling women' and use other terms such as ‘partnership/participation,'” Saleha Abedin wrote. “Do not even mention driving for women! The last visitor received a torrent of rejoinders from the students who said they have more important challenges to contend with.”
They added: “Don't sound sympathetic to ‘women's plight' or be ‘patronizing' as other visitors have done and made the students extremely annoyed. They rightly consider these as in-house issues that they would like to address themselves and not for outsiders, no matter how well intentioned, to come in and tell them.”
Clinton's speechwriter seemingly took that advice. The 2010 speech, reviewed by Fox News, omitted the words “freedom” and “democracy,” and mentioned “elections” only in reference to those in Iraq.
'PAY-TO-PLAY' AT CLINTON STATE DEPARTMENT EXPOSED IN NEW EMAILS, WATCHDOG SAYS
“We need more partnerships like those that are underway here in Saudi Arabia that strengthen civil society, as well as local indigenous efforts to expand opportunities, so that more girls and women everywhere can participate fully in the spheres of society, if they so choose to do so,” Clinton said, using two key buzzwords recommended, during the town hall.
Clinton did not mention “driving for women” in the speech, as requested.
However, Clinton did speak out in 2011, telling reporters at a State Department news conference that they supported “brave” women in Saudi Arabia for protesting the Islamic kingdom's ban on female drivers.
“What these women are doing is brave and what they are seeking is right, but the effort belongs to them,” Clinton said that year, while making clear that such calls were not coming from the outside. “I am moved by it and I support them, but I want to underscore the fact that this is not coming from outside of their country. This is the women themselves, seeking to be recognized.”
Abedin's mother edits The Muslim Minority Affairs journal. The publication came under scrutiny during the 2016 presidential election, for having alleged connections to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Washington Post Fact Checker, though, rated that as false in August of last year after comments from Republican Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., accusing Abedin of having ties to the radical group.
The vision of the Dar Al Hekma college is to promote “high standards of character and learning in keeping with Islamic teachings” for women, according to the college's website.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Two mentally disabled women were strapped with explosives Friday and sent into busy Baghdad markets, where they were blown up by remote control, a top Iraqi government official said.
Iraqi soldiers secure the scene of a bombing Friday at a popular pet market in central Baghdad.
The bombs killed at least 98 people and wounded more than 200 at two popular pet markets on the holiest day of the week for Muslims, authorities said.
In both bombings, the attackers were mentally disabled women whose explosive belts were remotely detonated, Gen. Qasim Atta, spokesperson for Baghdad's security plan, told state television.
Atta said the women were strapped with dynamite and ball bearings, citing members of the bomb squad. The explosives were detonated via cell phone, they said.
An Atta aide said that people referred to the bomber at central Baghdad's al-Ghazl market as the "crazy woman" and that the bomber at a second market had an unspecified birth disability.
The aide said authorities believe the women were unaware of plans to detonate the explosives. Watch how the use of the women represents a new tactic »
The nationalities and identities of the women have not been released.
U.S. military officials referred to the two attacks as suicide bombings, saying both women detonated the explosive devices.
The U.S. officials also gave a much lower casualty toll, with 27 civilians dead and 53 others wounded.
The Pentagon attributed the attacks to al Qaeda in Iraq and made no reference to the mental conditions of the women.
"By targeting innocent Iraqis, they show their true demonic character," said Lt. Col. Steve Stover, spokesperson for the Multi-National Division-Baghdad.
"They care nothing for the Iraqi people; they want to subjugate them and forcefully create a greater Islamic sharia state," they said, referring to Islamic law.
The violence marked the bloodiest series of attacks in Baghdad since August, breaking a brief stretch of relative calm as attacks and deaths dropped after the 2007 increase in U.S. troop strength called the surge.
In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the attacks show the reality of the continuing struggle against militants, adding that Iraqis have turned against "these terrible, violent people in their midst who will do anything."
"It certainly underscores and affirms the decision of the Iraqi people that there is no political program here that is acceptable to a civilized society, and that this is the most brutal and the most bankrupt of movements that would do this kind of thing," they said at a press briefing. "And I think that will underscore for the Iraqis, and it will make them tougher in the fight."
The first bomb blew up at al-Ghazl animal market around 10:30 a.m., killing 69 and wounding more than 140. The second blast happened about a half-hour later in the New Baghdad neighborhood pet market, killing 29 people and wounding 67.
Al-Ghazl pet market is a popular destination where people buy and sell cats, dogs, monkeys and other animals. Attackers have struck the market on Fridays -- its busiest day -- several times in the last year or so.
A January 2007 bombing killed 15 and wounded 52 at the pet market, and 13 people died and 58 were wounded in a November attack.
Other developments
A parked car exploded Thursday in a predominantly Shiite district in the Iraqi capital, killing five civilians and wounding eight others, the Interior Ministry said. The attack occurred after a string of roadside bombings that wounded 21 people, the ministry said.
Poland will withdraw its troops from Iraq by the end of October, a spokesperson for the Polish military said Thursday. October 31 will be the last day of the Polish presence, Maj. Dariusz Kacperczyk said in Warsaw. About 900 Polish troops are in Iraq, with most in Diwaniya, some in Baghdad and others in the southern city of Kut. Twenty-two Polish troops have died during the nearly 5-year war in Iraq.

(CNN) On Sunday morning, President Donald Trump sent out a tweet containing video in which they pummel a person with a CNN logo as its head. The tweet was accompanied by these hashtags "#FraudNewsCNN #FNN."
It's in keeping with Trump's broad theme of the media as "fake" and their more narrowly focused message of late that CNN is the worst of the bunch.
(Sidebar: I'm not going to post the tweet here because, well, advocating violence against reporters is not something I want to give attention to.)
In a statement, CNN called it a "sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters."
"Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when they said the President had never done so," CNN's statement continued. "Instead of preparing for their overseas trip, their first meeting with Vladimir Putin, ‎dealing with North Korea and working on their health care bill, they are instead involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of their office. We will keep doing our jobs. They should start doing his."
The video Trump used for the tweet came from an appearance Trump made in 2007 on the pro wrestling juggernaut World Wrestling Entertainment . In the original footage, Trump clotheslines WWE CEO Vince McMahon, who is taunting "Stone Cold" Steve Austin.
The appearance was part of a short-lived "feud" between McMahon and Trump, which was billed as the "battle of the billionaires." (In real life, the two men are very friendly. McMahon's wife, Linda, is now a member of Trump's Cabinet as the Small Business Administrator.)
How do I know this? Because I watched it live. Because I love pro wrestling -- always have, always will.
And, because of my decades spent watching pro wrestling, I have long believed that one of the best ways to understand the Trump campaign and now the Trump presidency is through the lens of professional wrestling and, in particular, the Vince McMahon-era WWE.
Let me explain.
At the heart of pro wrestling sits this basic fact: It is fake. It is a scripted television show. Yes, it requires physical ability -- no one who is not in excellent shape could perform some of the falls and bumps these wrestlers do daily. But it is, at heart, a soap opera. Scriptwriters plot character arcs and narrative building. The outcomes are known before the matches begin. The wrestlers are as many actors as they are athletes. (Look to the acting successes of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and John Cena for proof of that fact.)
But, and this is the really important part, not everyone who is a fan of pro wrestling knows this. Lots and lots of people who go to the shows, who buy the t-shirts and who subscribe to the WWE Network believe that this is all real. That the feuds are real expressions of dislike between the wrestlers. That "Mr. McMahon" is an evil, money-grubbing CEO. That "Bray Wyatt" is some sort of mystical southern shaman rather than just Windham Rotunda, the son of longtime pro wrestler Mike Rotunda and the grandson of "Blackjack" Mulligan. (I warned you I am a wrestling mark.)
This basic divide between fake and real is what Trump capitalizes on, too.
Anyone who has followed their career in business or politics knows that there isn't a more attentive media consumer than Donald Trump. They watch cable TV constantly -- as evidenced by the installation of a 60-plus-inch TV in their dining room near the Oval Office . (Ask yourself: If they don't watch TV, as they claim, then what do they watch on that TV?) They love this stuff. Always has. Always will. And, if and when Trump ever reaches out to you as a reporter, they are tremendously solicitous; they praise your work and says you are one of the good ones. (Trump did this to me during the campaign.)
Most people -- particularly in the media -- know this fact. But lots of other people, including many of Trump's supporters, truly believe that they hate the media. That they are the fighter against "fake news" they have been waiting for their entire lives. They don't get that Trump is playing a role, that they are doing a schtick because they know there is political gain to be had there.
Then there is the fact that pro wrestling has long -- and successfully -- played to peoples' stereotypes for eyeballs and audience intensity. When I was growing up in the 1980s, a character named the "Iron Sheik" was the biggest "heel" (a bad guy) in the wrestling world. Their character was created following the Iranian hostage crisis of the early 1980s. They would enter the ring carrying an Iranian flag and bow to it before the matches . Nikolai Volkoff, who would sing the Russian national anthem in the middle of the ring, was another of the top heels of that era.
McMahon grasped early on that playing on peoples' fears and anger was a ratings goldmine. Booing is a powerful thing. Uniting behind a common enemy has real resonance. That McMahon created cartoon villains -- broad-brush sketches of what made people afraid or upset -- was besides the point. That it worked was the whole point.
Trump traffics in this same sort of approach.  They are a famed -- by their own account -- counter-puncher. They do better when there is something or someone to run against.
In the 2016 campaign, that was easy; they had "Crooked" Hillary. But, as president, Trump has struggled to find an enemy. The Republican-controlled Congress? Meh. The leaderless Democratic party? Not so much.
What they have turned to then is the media. And they have worked aggressively to paint journalists as not only biased and "fake" but also as a stand-in for the so-called "elites" Trump supporters detest. If Trump was running the WWE, they would create a wrestler who was a reporter. That character -- call them Clark Can't -- would have gone to Harvard, would work for CNN or The New York Times, would wear glasses and would spend the time before each match lecturing the crowd about how they need to be more politically correct. (In truth, the character would likely be a huge success as a villain.)
There's one crucial difference between what Vince McMahon does and what Donald Trump does, however. McMahon is the CEO of an entertainment company whose lone goal is to make money for that company. Donald Trump is the president of the United States, whose salary is paid by taxpayers and whose job is to represent a nation of 300 million people stateside and in the world community.
Pro wrestling is fake. Being president isn't. Trump seems not to know or care about that distinction.

Dara O'Briain will be hosting a new video game show, Dara O'Briain's Go 8 Bit, on UK TV later this year.
The Edinburgh stage show is headed to TV Channel Dave and will initially consist of six episodes.
Weekly team captains Steve McNeil and Sam Pamphilon will guide celebrity guests through five rounds of “hilarious gaming contests,” supported by comedians Dara O'Briain and games-journalist-turned-comedian, Ellie Gibson. The contests will span a whole range of games, from retro titles to the latest AAA.
“Put a video game controller in the hands of a nun and she'll turn into a trash-talking bloodthirsty monster. Give a controller to a comedian and they'll do that too, but be funny,” O'Briain said in a statement.
“In video games veritas, my friends. This show is a raucous, back-biting, properly competitive celebration of the world's favourite pastime. Let's Go 8 Bit!"
Executive producer Don Taffner Jr. added: “Dara O Briain's Go 8 Bit is unlike anything else on TV. It is a completely new type of gaming show with its mix of gaming experts, comedians, guest stars and nostalgia to create an unmissable entertainment series.
“The show will combine our love for retro games with the latest technology and audience interaction that all viewers – young, old, male, female, and most importantly gamers and non gamers – will love. We are looking forward to working with UKTV and Dave to bring this exciting new concept to life.”
Dara O'Briain's Go 8 Bit will air in Q3/Autumn 2016 (that's Fall to you Americans, and, uh, Spring(?) for you Aussies).
I still haven't quite come to terms of the loss of GamesMaster, and I'm anxious not to get my hopes too high (remember Games World?!). How about you?

NEW YORK (Fortune) -- To understand what Washington is actually up to, you have to watch what it does, not what it says. That's especially true when it comes to Washington's role in the ongoing bailout of Wall Street, part of its "let's hope this works" plan to revive the U.S. economy.
While Washington is setting the populist mob on the individual American International Group (AIG, Fortune 500) employees who got a total of $165 million in bonuses this year, far larger amounts of money are being quietly handed to Wall Street through programs that generate barely a peep of protest.
Let me count the ways - or at least some of them.
We'll start with the proposed public-private investment program for toxic assets. It depends heavily on a massive subsidy from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which would insure the borrowings of the program's investors. The borrowings would be up to six-sevenths of the total invested; the Treasury and Wall Street (which I define as the nation's big financial institutions and money managers) would each put up half of the initial seventh.
I'm glad that taxpayers stand to get half the profits and fees because the Treasury's in the game. But the Treasury and the FDIC (whose guarantees for such huge sums are credible only because they're backed by the Treasury) run much more risk than the private investors, whose loss is limited to their investment.
The subsidy, by my back-of-the-envelope math, could be worth $18 billion a year to the Wall Street investors. That assumes that the program raises $75 billion from Wall Street and that the guarantees lower interest costs by 4% on the Street's $450 billion share of the borrowings. That's more than 100 times the AIG bonuses.
We also have the Federal Reserve Board's programs to revive the economy by offering cheap money under a dozen plans invented since the credit crunch began in earnest in the summer of 2007. They total around $1.1 trillion by my count, so a three-point saving - a very conservative number - is more than $30 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the Fed's decision to buy Treasury paper and assorted U.S. mortgage-backed securities isn't helping troubled home-owners. Rather, these purchases, designed to lower mortgage rates, benefit well-off homeowners, who can refinance at new, cheaper rates. It also boosts the market value of the tons of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities held by Wall Street. Marginal or distressed homeowners don't qualify for cheap mortgages because lenders have toughened their credit standards.
I'm not saying, by the way, that any of these programs are necessarily bad. We have to get out of this horrible financial mess somehow, and the feds are throwing everything they have against the wall to see what sticks. But if you want to yell about taxpayer money subsidizing Wall Street, you should look at those programs, not waste time with AIG bonuses, which are symbolically important but economically meaningless.
Yes, AIG has received vast amounts of bailout money from the government. But that doesn't mean that every bonus-receiving employee is some sort of troll or incompetent who deserves to be threatened with a 90% tax or with having their address made public so that people can picket their house.
I won't even mention that this uproar in the name of preserving taxpayer money has cost taxpayers bigtime. We own 79.9% of AIG's stock and have committed $180 billion in loans and investments to it. This uproar has eviscerated our investment by destroying AIG's reputation and shredding the value of its businesses. Good luck on getting anything like our $180 billion back.
Finally, if you want a real bonus outrage, consider this: The operation getting the biggest taxpayer subsidy of all - the federal government - pays bonuses to its employees too. This year it plans to hand out about $1.6 billion of bonuses, despite running more than $1 trillion in the red.
So there you have it. While the public is focused on AIG small fry, Wall Street's big fish are getting the bulk of Washington's goodies. As always, follow the money. Not the noise.
Allan Sloan invites you to post your questions to them about Wall Street, dealmaking and the state of the financial crisis in a Fortune Talkback forum. He'll choose several questions to answer in a future online installment of their column, The Deal.
Take a deep breath, scratch any errant itches, and feast your eyes upon the latest bed bug research: According to a study published Monday in the Journal of Medical Entomology, the infuriating insects might prefer red and black to other colors. Don't go throwing out your black bedding just yet, though — the researchers aren't ready to claim that one set of sheets is more likely to attract bed bugs than another.
Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) like to hide in cracks and crevices (known as their "harborage") and they spend most of their time cuddled up in the best nooks they can find. As bed bugs become increasingly resistant to insecticides, scientists are more and more interested in figuring out what makes a good harborage — and how humans can ruin them.
Lots of insects use color as a behavioral cue, and color is a cheap thing to change when designing a new kind of trap. So researchers at the University of Florida and Union College decided to see if bed bugs showed any color preferences. Previous studies have shown that bed bugs can't distinguish color very well in the dark — which is when they do most of their moving and feeding — but the researchers wanted to see whether color might be important when bed bugs had light shone on them, which usually prompts a frenzied move toward hiding places.
[How'd the bedbug get its bite? Scientists look to its genome for clues.]
"It was speculated that a bed bug would go to any harborage in an attempt to hide," the researchers wrote in the study. "However, these color experiments show that bed bugs do not hide in just any harborage; rather, they will select a harborage based on its color when moving in the light."
They placed bed bugs in petri dishes with different color choices; little tents of colored material. Each bug got 10 minutes to pick a hiding spot, then its choice was recorded. The researchers shuffled the color choices around to be sure their picks weren't based on location within the dish, and they tested bed bugs of different age, sex and feeding status to check for differences in color preference. They also did longer experiments with females who were about to lay eggs to see if they had a favorite shade under which to leave their brood.
Bed bugs that were hungry cared less about color in general, and the different sexes had different colors that they favored over white. But across the board, the bed bugs showed a significant preference for red and black.
"We originally thought the bed bugs might prefer red because blood is red and that's what they feed on," study co-author Corraine McNeill of Union College said in a statement. But the researchers found that the bed bugs seemed to like black just as much — and that they cared less about what color they scurried to when they were looking for a meal — which suggested that something else might be going on.
[How many types of bugs live in your house right this minute? Science weighs in.]
Yellow was basically as unpopular as white with all of the bed bugs tested, with green following close behind. That may be because the bugs read yellow as bright, making them want to hide from it as if it's a light. Conversely, they might see red and black as being dark, and therefore hidden and safe. It could also be that red and black surfaces look more like piles of bed bugs, while yellow and white surfaces show nervous critters that they're all alone.
The researchers only tested the egg-laying preferences of 10 bed bugs — which isn't enough to draw any strong conclusions from — but for what it's worth, the bugs they studied didn't seem interested in laying eggs under yellow or green harborage.
"I always joke with people, 'Make sure you get yellow sheets!'" McNeill said in a statement. "But to be very honest, I think that would be stretching the results a little too much."
After all, bed bugs are often already settled into their hiding places when you turn your bedroom lights on — and when they scurry around in the dark, they don't give a hoot whether your sheets are black as night or yellow as the sun. But these color preferences could still be useful in designing traps: "The point isn't to use the color traps in isolation, but to use color preference as something in your toolkit to be paired with other things such as pheromones or carbon dioxide to potentially increase the number of bed bugs in a trap," McNeill explained.
Then again, bed bugs tend to make people pretty desperate. So if you're in the throes of a debilitating infestation, maybe it's worth giving bright yellow sheets a go. We won't judge.

“This is a song about an old Welsh witch…”
That's how Stevie Nicks often introduced live performances of Fleetwood Mac's “Rhiannon.” These opening words, paired with their penchant for long, black dresses, fueled rumors that Nicks themselves was a witch. “In the beginning of my career, the whole idea that some wacky, creepy people were writing, ‘You're a witch, you're a witch!' was so arresting,” Nicks told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. “And there I am like, ‘No, I'm not! I just wear black because it makes me look thinner you idiots.'” Thirty years after the rumors, Nicks was cast as a witch in Ryan Murphy's American Horror Story: Coven, now seemingly at peace with their place in pop culture. It should come as little shock, then, that Nicks appears on Lana Del Rey's latest album Lust for Life. After all, if there's one musician whose career Del Rey's has emulated for the past seven years, it's Nicks'.
When Del Rey burst into the mainstream in 2011 with “Video Games” and “Blue Jeans,” they described themselves as a “gangsta Nancy Sinatra.” And their disaffected go-go dancer aesthetic was indeed straight out of the “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” playbook. Throughout their career, she's added tinges of hip-hop, a la Debbie Harry, and some west coast rock ‘n' roll in the vein of Courtney Love, but at their core, Del Rey has exuded a nostalgic, hippie-nomad appeal perfectly in line with Nicks' Fleetwood Mac days.
Del Rey faced their own striking criticism around the release of their 2012 debut album, Born to Die, and accompanying Saturday Night Live debacle. It's still amusing to see the breathless prose about Del Rey's talent when just a handful of years ago they were a punching bag for music critics. There was much ado about their origins and their former life as Lizzy Grant. They were labeled a fraud, manufactured as a pin-up girl by their managers. Them early career coverage was dominated much more by their personal drama than the merits of their music. Perhaps being in a group with men protected Nicks from these types of misogynistic attacks, but there was certainly no shortage of tabloid gossip about Fleetwood Mac's cocaine-fueled writing and Nicks' tumultuous relationship with bandmate Lindsey Buckingham.
Speaking to The Guardian in 2014, Del Rey had begun to adopt a fatalistic approach to their career. On the backlash their debut album received, they claimed, “I wish I was dead already,” and that they “never felt any of the enjoyment” of their album's success. Though they mused that she'd already said all they had to say with Born to Die, Del Rey quietly worked on follow-up album Ultraviolence. As they ditched their affected ‘50s style and dug more into the darkness of pop music, Del Rey finally found their niche—and critics agreed. Ultraviolence was incredibly well-received and its moody, foreboding West Coast vibes (there's even a standout song titled “West Coast”) called to mind nostalgic Americana just as much as it felt like the soundtrack to Sharon Tate's final hours in Los Angeles.
Perhaps this explains the kinship between Del Rey and Nicks: both embraced the allure of darkness, albeit in different ways. Nicks donned all black and looked how you imagined a witch to be, whereas Del Rey resembled one of the Charmed sisters, their witchcraft and malevolence hidden behind a plastered smile. Lust for Life has been dubbed their “happy album” because of its abundance of features and the big smile they sport on the album cover, but look beneath the surface and the music is as chilling as ever. “When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing” is an appropriately melancholy song for our ever approaching end of days. Even “Lust for Life,” a radio single penned with The Weeknd, seems like a song devoted to lovers who cling to sex as a retreat from the horrors of the world. At another point on the album, Del Rey even intones: “I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'.”
Nicks speaks fondly of their strongest bond in Fleetwood Mac—with fellow singer and songwriter Christine McVie. “We shared rooms, did each other's makeup and lived on Dunkin' Donuts,” they recall, elucidating the bond of female friendship that kept both women sane during the more hedonistic days of Fleetwood Mac. It's this relationship that's mirrored on “Beautiful People Beautiful Problems,” Nicks' duet with Del Rey. Both women sing about love and grief in the chorus—“But we're just beautiful people / With beautiful problems, yeah / Beautiful problems / God knows we've got them”—and it's a perfect marriage of two beguiling artists who overcame darkness in their pasts and came out stronger and altogether bewitching.
Del Rey's origin story involves “homelessness, biker gangs and being caught in the eye of a media hurricane,” and it may have led them to disappear into Americana to heal herself, but now they no longer relies on it. “I'm not going to have the American flag waving while I'm singing ‘Born to Die.' I'd rather have static,” Del Rey told Pitchfork recently.
The recent election was a wake-up call that's caused Del Rey to embrace their own magic. They told NME that they placed a hex on Donald Trump after the inauguration and realized “words are one of the last forms of magic and I'm a bit of a mystic at heart.” It's why Del Rey's collaboration with Nicks encapsulates the strengths of both women's careers and overall dominance in pop culture. Thirty years ago Nicks would have never appeared on American Horror Story; they were too defeated by the constant discussion of whether or not they were a “witch.” But now, they say: “I'm way too old and I've been a through way too much to give up an opportunity like this. I'm fearless. I'm not afraid of anything. Don't you ever be afraid of anything.”
As Nicks sings along with Del Rey on Lust for Life, the 32-year-old artist's strongest work yet, you can tell Del Rey is anything but afraid.
Good morning everyone! And happy Tuesday! 😀

Here are the ingredients for the newest version:
…and the ingredients for the older version:
The newer version has Royal Jelly Extract, which I'm pretty excited about! The newer one also has higher percentages of sunscreen in it of course, to cause the new addition of a “+” in the label. Other than this, the two products are identical in ingredients – some of them have been shuffled around in their order, but otherwise, no other changes can be seen.
The two have major differences in packaging. The older version is covered in a layer of hard plastic:
While the newer one is just shrink-wrapped and glued to the cardboard backing:
Here I am peeling off the shrink-wrap:
So this is what the newer version looks like (very similar, only the size of the letters has changed, pretty much):
The backside:
With the twist-cap off:
And here is what the older version looks like (the one that I'm almost done using):
The backside:
With the twist-cap off:
Okay so how does the actual product inside compare??
Below is the old product:
It seems like a suspension (you can see the specks of sunscreen suspended in a gel) and it absorbs very quickly when blended out, and it's very smooth and watery/gel-like. You can smell the alcohol in it slightly, but it's really a very pleasant scent. Other sunscreens I've tried (Skin Aqua, Sara Fit) have such a strong alcohol smell, so when I went back to this one, it was such a relief!
And here is the new product:
Ohhhh my gosh, look at the difference in texture! And when blended out, it seems more watery than the older one. And this one seems really homogenous in consistency. AND so hydrating! It absorbed just as quickly as the older one, but it left my skin feeling so hydrated. Ahhhhh!!! I am so impressed! Can't wait to try this on my face!!! 😀
So with this one, I can also kind of smell the alcohol in it, but I had to really, really try hard to detect the smell. This newer one smells even better, kind of sweet smell! I am loving it already!!
Have any of you tried the new version, or the old version? What are your thoughts? What's your favorite sunscreen?

On the Guardian's Comment Is Free today, Nadine Dorries attempts to justify proposals they are spearheading to restrict women's access to legal abortion and deny proper sex education to young girls.
I have already written about the venal, illiberal campaign in Westmister to force women who wish to terminate pregnancies to go through counselling with an "independent provider" -- likely, in practice, to mean "biased and illiberal" religious counsellors, according to a spokesperson for Abortion Rights UK.
I have also written about how Dorries and some lobbyists are seeking to force these changes through without a vote,and the further hurdles that this will place on the already demeaning and unecessary process of accessing legal abortion in this country. However, one sentence in particular jumps out in Dorries' article, which we will assume was written by Dorries themselves and not drafted on their behalf by Christian lobbyists:
At present, the only place a woman can receive pre- or post-abortion counselling paid for by the state is from an abortion provider - who has a clear financial interest in the ultimate decision the woman makes.
Two thoughts immediately occur:
1. If profit is an unacceptable vested interest when private companies are involved in abortion provision, why is it acceptable when it comes to the provision of any other healthcare service?
2. Why does it never, ever occur to Conservatives and other free-market fundamentalists that doctors and other public servants might have other reasons for offering the services they provide besides financial gain? In fact, of all the private companies who currently offer healthcare services in this country, abortion providers are perhaps the most necessary and humane, as their independence offers a crucial lifeline for women too desperate or traumatised by an NHS service in which doctors are allowed to withhold treatment for "moral" reasons.
The government's determination to increase competition in public services automatically assumes that profit is the overriding motive for anyone who works in healthcare, social care or education. It assumes that human beings are naturally selfish, and must be threatened and goaded into doing their jobs properly. That is no way to run a country.
In their article, Dorries speaks of "increasing choice" for women -- by giving them no choice but to go through counselling if they need an abortion. This, too, points to something really venal in coalition newspeak that should worry all of us, whether or not we support a woman's right to safe, legal abortion.
Whether they are discussing cutting public services or obstructing abortion access, the language of "choice" is always employed when confiscating people's most basic rights. We're not restricting access to higher education -- we're letting you choose whether you want to pay £8,000 or £18,000 a year!
The left, too, is guilty of equivocating, of parroting the neo-liberal language of "choice" when we really mean to speak of "rights".
The language of rights and freedoms has corroded over the past three decades, in part because centre-left governments have been quick to adopt managerial rhetoric, to speak of "outcomes" and "choices" whenever it seemed that social justice and human dignity might not play well to the Murdoch press. (Adam Curtis' excellent documentary The Trap is a great explanation of the history and ideology behind this managerial discourse of 'choice'.)
The "pro-choice" campaign is as good a flashpoint as any. Speaking of protecting women's "choices" is a mitigated way, toothless way of discussing what's really at stake -- every woman's right to have control over what happens to their body, every woman's right not to be forced to undergo pregnancy and labour against their will when there are medical alternatives.
Speaking of the "right to choose" is a reasonable and decent compromise, but a compromise nonetheless.
Across the left, we must not allow ourselves to capitulate to the managerial language of the right, because they will always be better at it than us, by virtue of really meaning it. We need to stop talking about choice, and start talking about rights -- whether that's the right to healthcare, housing and a decent standard of living, or the right to access abortion services without being forced to undergo counselling, as if we were unable to cope with the responsibility of freedom.

This week, nearly four months after the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, it's become clear that there are two profoundly problematic responses to that French mag and its bloody travails.
The first is the cowardice of the Western writers and cartoonists who cannot bring themselves to say ‘Je suis Charlie', at least not without adding a massive ‘But' at the end: ‘But it was a racist magazine', ‘But it upset Muslims'. And the second unhelpful response comes from those who can only say ‘Je suis Charlie'. Those who have turned ‘being Charlie' into the litmus test of liberalism, the passport into polite society, the measure of every man and woman's moral decency. The reason this second response, the ‘Charlie' camp itself, is becoming a problem is because it is obscuring the bigger, historic, Europe-wide crisis of freedom of speech, which goes far beyond two psychotic gunmen acting on behalf of Allah. In fact, it has become a means of avoiding talking about that crisis. ‘Je suis Charlie' is increasingly a distraction, and a dangerous one. One thing that most people who are in possession of a moral compass will agree on is that writers like Peter Carey are moral invertebrates. This week, Carey and other prominent authors — Michael Ondaatje, Teju Cole, Rachel Kushner, Francine Prose — said they were pulling out of a PEN gala dinner in New York following PEN's decision to give its Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo. They feel that giving this award to a rabble-rousing mag like Charlie is ‘inappropriate' – that dead bureaucratic phrase used by 21st-century cowards and censors who can't bring themselves to say ‘heretical', which is what they really mean.
Kushner said they didn't want to celebrate a magazine that promotes ‘cultural intolerance'. Carey says: ‘A hideous crime was committed, but was it a freedom-of-speech issue for PEN America…?' When you're adding a ‘but' right after talking about the cold-blooded execution of 12 people for the crime of having made fun of a religion, you know you have problems. Carey went on to slam the ‘cultural arrogance of the French nation', which ‘does not recognise its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population'. The fantastic irony here is that Carey is themselves being culturally arrogant, depicting an entire nation as a gaggle of racially unaware ignoramuses: national chauvinism disguised as concern for Muslims. But the most telling thing is their idea that Charlie Hebdo should have wound its neck in rather than offend a ‘segment of the population'. This cuts to the heart of the supineness of those who balk at any honouring of Charlie Hebdo, which includes not only those gala-flouncing writers but also Garry Trudeau, creator of the Doonesbury cartoon. The motor of their moral cowardice is the idea that we should avoid giving offence, that to offend is tantamount to abuse. Their elitist allergy to saying ‘Je suis Charlie' reveals the extent to which the ideology of multiculturalism, with its relativistic notion that all cultures are equally valid and It's instinct to shush criticism of any particular culture, has much of the literary set in its grip. Their description of ridicule and blasphemy — which is what Charlie did — as ‘cultural intolerance' confirms the creeping criminalisation of certain forms of speech, the transformation of heatedness, controversy itself, into a social problem, possibly even a form of violence. They're expressing one of the worst ideas of our time: that respect for an individual's or a group's sensitivities should trump the right of others to say what they want; that feelings are more important than freedom. Their ‘erms' and ‘ahhs' and ‘buts' in relation to Charlie Hebdo add up to an alarming failure to stand up for freedom of speech; worse, they contribute to an increasingly chilling climate of word-watching and self-censorship for fear of giving offence. It's terrible stuff, yes. But is the response to such Charlie-dodging writers any better? Not really. There's something wrong in the other camp, too, among those who say ‘Je suis Charlie' all the time, and in fact have made ‘Je suis Charlie' into a cultural signifier, a kind of password that grants you access to the Real Liberal Set. These true liberals, as they imagine themselves, have fetishised Charlie, turning what ought to be a liberal cry — ‘I support the right of everyone, including Charlie Hebdo, to say whatever they want' — into a kind of dogma: ‘Je suis Charlie, and woe betide anyone who isn't.' The reason they have done this is as obvious as it is depressing: it's because ‘being Charlie', being opposed to the killing of journalists, is easy, far easier than digging down and trying to understand, not to mention oppose, the everyday, continent-wide undermining of freedom of speech and the way it is truncating what may be thought and said in almost every area of life today.
There is a certain kind of commentator – the self-styled true liberal – who only becomes animated about free speech when Charlie is involved. So they went into overdrive when Trudeau made their Charlie criticisms. They kicked up a fuss when Queen's University in Belfast, citing ‘security concerns', cancelled a conference on Charlie Hebdo. They went into meltdown this week over Carey, Kushner and the other backbone-free writers. But where were they when Dieudonne, the racist French comedian, was arrested for anti-Semitic speech? Or when a 24-year-old football fan in Scotland was jailed for singing an offensive song? Or when three homophobes in France were arrested for tweeting? Or during any of the other too-numerous-to-mention assaults on freedom of speech that have occurred in Europe in the nearly four months since the Charlie massacre? To be Charlie without also being Dieudonne, Rangers fans, homophobes, racists, mad tweeters and all the rest is not to be in favour of free speech at all — it is just to be Charlie, nothing more. It's not hard to see why these ‘true liberals' are so drawn to the Charlie cause. First there's the easiness of it (‘I am for the dead', says one writer, which brought to mind that old campaign group Mothers Against Murder and Aggression — who, precisely, is for those things?). And secondly, the Charlie killings allow them to dramatise the crisis of free speech, to treat the assault on this freedom as an urgent, explosive, external threat, emanating from strange people polluted with non-European ideas and ugly intolerance. It is far harder to look at the true threat to free speech today, which comes right from the heart of our own societies, which is a product of the modern West's own slow-motion abandonment of Enlightenment values and its everyday, drip-drip, not-especially-dramatic burying of the ideals upon which it was founded. How much more straightforward, and fun, to say ‘I oppose those two lunatics with guns' than to look into the soul of your own society and see what a parlous state it is in — a result, not of one-off massacres or foreign influence, but of Western institutions' own loss of faith in themselves.
Battlefield Hardline is the fastest Battlefield ever, featuring a cinematized take on the cops vs. criminals fantasy.
To make the game truly immersive, the entire cast of Battlefield Hardline spent extended time at “A Place to Shoot” in Santa Clarita, CA, learning how to fire real weapons.
Chic Daniel, a 25-year veteran of the L.A.P.D with over 20 years of movie experience, has worked on forty movies and television shows, including films by Steven Soderberg, Michael Mann, and Roland Jaffe, just to name a few. Their input on voice over sessions with the actors helped make the game feel like a real cop show.
Meet the SWAT Consultant who trained the cast of Battlefield Hardline.
What type of background leads someone into a career consulting with a game like Battlefield Hardline?
I spent three years in the United States Army. During my time in the military I received extensive firearms training with a variety of weapons, including handguns, fully automatic rifles, and sniper rifles.
Upon leaving the military, I tested for and was accepted into the Los Angeles Police Department, where I spent twenty-six years.
I then transferred to 77th Division, which patrolled some of the most notorious areas of South Central LA. After working patrol there, I was chosen for the CRASH unit (Gang Unit) and spent three years dealing with street gangs in the area.
Did you mostly perform uniformed police work?
During this time, I was approached to work in a specialized Metropolitan Division and was immediately involved in the investigations of several high profile cases, investigations requiring us to work undercover for months at a time. During my time involved in these investigations all the suspects were apprehended, tried and convicted.
An additional part of Metropolitan Division is the Special Weapons And Tactics (better known as SWAT) unit. SWAT is responsible for handling all barricaded suspects, hostage situations, high-risk search warrants, VIP security (including assisting the Secret Service with Presidential protection and the State Department with visiting Dignitaries).
After working SWAT for twelve years I promoted to Detective and was placed within the highly sought-after Major Narcotics detail. Most of my time in Majors was spent at Los Angeles International Airport working within a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Task Force. We were responsible the investigation, interdiction and apprehension of narcotics and currency traffickers.
I stayed in Majors right up until my retirement from the Department.
How did you first get involved with Battlefield Hardline?
My involvement with Battlefield Hardline began early on, offering notes on the script, which may were meant to help authenticate some areas of the law enforcement backstory.
Even though I wasn't involved directly in the casting process, I felt the choices matched the roles created very well. Having read the script before meeting the actors, I was pleased to see that the parts and the casting picks matched.
Once the cast was in place, it was time to involve the actors in live fire training on a wide variety of weapons, from semi-auto handguns to full auto machine guns.
What is it like to train actors using real weapons?
I've learned from my past experiences working with actors, including myself, that allowing live weapon during training fire helps instill the respect necessary when handling any firearm.
Once you understand the concept and receive the proper training, replicating the actions becomes easier on stage.
For our live fire training, we utilized a range called “A Place To Shoot” in Saugus, Ca. We filmed there for a day on a closed set.
All of our actors and the members of our production team had the opportunity to fire handguns, shotguns and rifles.
Once the training was complete, it was time to take that knowledge learned and implement it into the actual filming process.
What were the biggest challenges in working on Battlefield Hardline?
This being my first experience working on a video game, I quickly realized that the biggest challenge would be the size of the space used for filming. It is more in line with the size of a live theatre stage then an expansive movie set. This created closer interaction between the actors.
It was a slow and deliberate process. I was most impressed with the true professionalism exhibited by all participants. Everyday I was there I was amazed at the precision needed to either match movements required or the very choreographed actions called for the actors.
Filming a feature film may take as many as 100 days, and occasionally more. One episode of a TV show might take seven or eight days. Filming for Battlefield Hardline took approximately eighteen months. I had no idea just how involved the creation of a fictitious world in which video games live could be.
What do you enjoy most about your job?
One area of working as a Technical Advisor, whether for film, television or video games, is the opportunity to work with talented, hardworking, creative people. And that once again proved true with Battlefield Hardline. Everyone I interacted with were a pleasure to work with. Cate Latchford, Senior Producer, was responsible for getting me involved with the project and it was a true privilege to work with them
Collin Hennen (Cinematic Director) took the time and patience to explain the process needed their creative vision. They would accept my input and explain why at times it wouldn't or couldn't work.
What are your favorite video games?
I'm not currently a video game player, so my area of expertise is limited to Pong, Asteroids, Pac-Man and a few other old-school arcade games.

YouTube/HBO/"Going Clear" As Alex Gibney's documentary Going Clear opens around the country, the Church of Scientology is making its final stand against the film in the form of a five-page letter to The Hollywood Reporter.
The letter opens, "In two hours this film racks up more falsehoods, errors, embellished tales and blatant omissions than were committed by Rolling Stone, Brian Williams and Bill O'Reilly combined. By our calculation, the film on average includes at least one major error every two minutes."
"Going Clear" director Alex Gibney Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images
The letter, which can be read here, attempts to rip apart Gibney's sources in the film with ad hominem attacks, describing one as a wife beater, one as a violent psychopath and yet another as a home wrecker, but fails to tackle any major revelation in the film.
THR initially reached out to the Church to request a viewing of the documentary with top Church officials, but Church spokesperson Karin Pouw declined this offer. Instead, they asked for a list of questions about the film, which they would "be happy" to answer, so that's what THR sent: a list of twenty questions regarding specific allegations in Gibney's work, such as the claim that L. Ron Hubbard once said starting a religion is the easiest way to make money.
Pouw's letter is the Church's blanket response to each of the film's claims, which include the following:
Hubbard was involved with the occult; Hubbard once kidnapped their own daughter; Hubbard founded Scientology as a way to bolster their declining book sales; Scientology's secretive Sea Org was founded by Hubbard as a ploy to remain beyond the reach of the IRS, which was investigating them for tax evasion; Hubbard wrote a letter in 1947 to the Veterans Administration (now the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs) in the wake of their World War II service, seeking out psychiatric help; the Church pays its members between $.06-$.40 an hour for labor services; the Church buys up expensive real estate property simply to maintain its tax exempt status, which requires a large portion of its earnings to be spent for the benefit its congregation; the Church blackmailed John Travolta with private information to keep them from leaving the Church; the Church enacts a Draconian "Disconnection" policy, which mandates that Church members completely cut off anyone who leaves Scientology, including friends and family.
Pouw's response letter, however, dismisses the questions: "The false allegations in Gibney's film are reflected in each of the questions you ask," Pouw writes. "Those questions bear no relationship to L. Ron Hubbard or to the Scientology religion. Rather than provide a response to each of these questions, which are part of Gibney's propaganda, I am going to take up the sources of these allegations so you understand their motivations to spread hatred, religious bigotry and lies. We are not trying to discredit these people. It is simply that Mr. Gibney ismiscrediting them."
In their letter, Kouw then refers THR to a series of videos the Church published about Alex Gibney and the former Scientology members who appear in their film, including Spanky Taylor, Sara Goldberg, Hana Whitfield, Marty Rathbun,Mike Rinder and Marc Headley. The videos are titled as follows: "Mike Rinder: The Wife Beater," "Marty Rathbun: A Violent Psychopath," "Marc Headley: The Soulless Sellout," "Hana Whitfield: Can You Spare a Billion?" "Sara Goldberg: The Home Wrecker" and "'Spanky' Taylor: The Drama Queen."
Kouw writes, "The inclusion of any of these liars is enough to irrevocably taint the film as biased propaganda. Including all of them is inexcusable." Kouw then rehashes the Church's previously-published allegations against each person, outing Goldberg's son for their alleged drug abuse, mocking Whitfield for an unsuccessful lawsuit against the Church and labeling Rathbun a cultist in their own right.
"Going Clear" director Alex Gibney with author Lawrence Wright at the Sundance Film Festival. Sonia Recchia/Getty Images for Sundance The letter concludes with an attack on Lawrence Wright, the author of Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief, from which the documentary was adapted. "Lawrence Wright is obviously suffering from an acute case of jealousy of Mr. Hubbard," Pouw writes, "and thus has tried to slander them out of spite."
"Mr. Hubbard was a writer," Pouw continues, "one of the giants of the Golden Age of pulp fiction, during the Great Depression. They were also the author of 13 New York Times bestsellers in the 1980s. Indeed, their works are published to this day in 50 languages and have sold hundreds of millions of copies, something Wright could only wish to accomplish."
"Your readers should have the benefit of the information I have provided you."
Pouw also asked THR to include Scientology's previous statement about the HBO documentary, which can be found here. The statement says Gibney "refused to answer over a dozen letters from the Churchasking for an opportunity to address any allegations; they never even sent one fact to check and they shunned 25 people who traveled to New York to meet with them with relevant answers to every single allegation that is in the film."
In response, Gibney has said that they reached out for interviews with key Church members, such as Church leader David Miscavige and Tom Cruise, but they were rebuffed.
The full letter to THR has been reproduced below:
The Green Party of Vancouver will run Pete Fry in the October 14 civic by-election.
Fry will seek to fill the city council seat left vacant after Vision Vancouver's Geoff Meggs stepped down to become the chief of staff for B.C. premier John Horgan.
Fry, who is the son of longtime federal MP Hedy Fry, said they want to focus on creating affordable housing and "throttling" luxury developments, while supporting Green Party leader Adriane Carr in council meetings.
"It's just the way the city is being run. I think it's time for a change and I think people are quite sick of Vision Vancouver and the way things have been going and I hope to bring that change," said Fry, who previously ran for council in 2014.
"This is an opportunity to actually really show what we can do by having two greens on council, because you need that second vote to pass motions."
Anti-poverty activist Jean Swanson and homeless advocate Judy Graves have also announced they will be running for the vacant seat.
The two largest parties in Vancouver, Vision Vancouver and the NPA, have yet to select their candidates.

Major League Baseball's All-Stars are gathered in San Diego this week to celebrate the best of the best. Given that the Padres are well on their way to a 10th consecutive playoff-free season while the Chargers are fresh off a miserable, four-win campaign -- and facing potential relocation -- it's nice for the great fans in San Diego to be treated to a non-depressing display of sport (see: Giancarlo Stanton's unbelievable showing in Monday night's Home Run Derby). Nice for those folks to have something to cheer about.
After all, in the wake of the Cavaliers snapping Cleveland's interminable title drought, The San Diego Union-Tribune's Michael Gehlken identified this city as the new American symbol of sports futility:
Seasons without major pro sport title
San Diego 109 (52 Chargers, 47 Padres, 6 Clippers, 4 Rockets)
Buffalo 103
Minneapolis 91
Milwaukee 90 â Michael Gehlken (@sdutGehlken) June 20, 2016
And honestly, there doesn't appear to be much potential for celebration on the horizon -- well, that is, until Philip Rivers is inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
That's right: Philip Rivers, Hall of Famer.
OK, Rivers is one of the wackiest candidates on the greatness scale that we've seen. But I strongly believe they are just that: a truly great quarterback, one worthy of a bronze bust in Canton.
You can argue that Rivers has never been a top-two quarterback in their own conference. You can argue that Rivers is the third-most Hall-worthy quarterback in the 2004 draft class. Even if those statements are valid, I argue that, if you judge Rivers solely against Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger and the Manning brothers, you're missing the entire thing. Just like if you judge Rivers solely on the stats.
Not that the numbers don't paint a rose-colored picture. Remember, Rivers sat on the pine behind Drew Brees for their first two professional seasons, so some of their counting stats trail those of their draft classmates, Big Ben and Eli. But do you realize Rivers has a higher completion percentage (64.8) than both of them? They also have more passing yards per game (252.7). Their career TD-to-INT rate (281:135) is superior to those of Roethlisberger (272:147) and Manning (294:199). Oh, and if you believe in the passer rating, Rivers boasts the best mark there, as well (95.5).
Numbers aside, though, Philip Rivers passes the eyeball test of greatness. You've seen it through the years, with the way Rivers has played. They have won games, carried flawed Chargers teams and defenses. Rivers has maximized pedestrian receivers and spotty lines. Don't forget: They spent six years of their prime getting Norved. (Look it up. It's a verb. Norv-ed (v) -- The act of a team underachieving due to Norv Turner being the head coach.)
If you actually have spent time watching San Diego's games over the past decade, you know Rivers is a shining star. Charger fans love him. Raiders, Broncos and Chiefs fans love to hate him. And opponents fear him. Rivers is cocky, but they back it up. They have a flair for the dramatic.
Of course, Eli and Ben each have a pair of Super Bowl rings. Manning is 8-3 in the playoffs and Roethlisberger is 11-6 (as compared to Rivers' 4-5 postseason mark). Those two deserve plenty of credit. No doubt about it. But I'm not going to take away from Rivers' career because the Chargers had playoff injuries, they had other stars who underachieved and they happened to run into Tom Brady and Peyton Manning -- clearly two of the best quarterbacks of all time. I'm not going to downgrade Rivers because of their genius.
Last month, I had Rivers on my SiriusXM Radio show, "Schein on Sports," for a wide-ranging interview. I asked them about their legacy and if they are overshadowed. Rivers immediately formed that familiar smile on theirs face.
"I don't know. Those guys you mention are worthy of receiving the recognition they've gotten," Rivers said. "You mention the AFC quarterbacks, and Brady and Peyton and what they've done over the years. And then the career Drew [Brees] has had, and Aaron Rodgers, who is probably the best in the game right now. And then you mention the guys in our draft class. I mean, Eli and Ben, they've both been to a couple of Super Bowls, won them. I don't think that it's been overshadowed. I feel like I've had a successful career thus far, and hopefully it is going to continue to be better and better."
OK, but honestly, Phil -- what about that elusive ring?
"My happiness is not going to be driven solely on whether we win a Super Bowl or not," Rivers said. "I want to win one so bad for our city and our team, but I'm not going to be a miserable person if we don't. Let's compete like crazy and see what happens down the home stretch."
Well ... I'll be the one to tell him: It's not going to happen. This will lead some people to question Rivers' legacy. Not me. And maybe that's what moves me to write this column in July of 2016, heading toward what could be another trying season in S.D.
It would take a miracle for the Chargers to even make the playoffs this year. The Raiders, Chiefs and defending-champion Broncos are all better. Not to mention what the rest of the AFC looks like. San Diego did Rivers no favors by eschewing a franchise left tackle with the third overall pick (instead taking defensive end Joey Bosa). Last year felt like a funeral for the Chargers in San Diego, with a move feeling inevitable. Well, that hasn't happened -- yet. For now, there's no closure. And oh, by the way, Mike McCoy's seat is blistering hot.
Rivers has no offensive line right now and might not have the same coach or city next year. Roethlisberger doesn't have such issues.
Rivers, 34, has four years left on their current deal. I expect them to individually play fabulously and maximize the "talent" around him, like always. And like always, they will watch the Super Bowl from home. They will watch other greats cement their legacies in the eyes of many football fans.
Bottom line: I love watching Philip Rivers play football. Their QB contemporaries -- boasting enviable playoff success -- make Rivers underappreciated. But big picture, Rivers' greatness should never be underrated.

Friday on ABC's “The View,” when asked if they want to run for president in 2020 billionaire business person and “Shark Tank” star Mark Cuban did not rule it out.
Co-host Joy Behar asked, “So Mark your name has actually been tossed around as a potential presidential candidate. Let's make news here. Are you into it?”
Cuban replied, “Definitely. No. We'll see what happens.”
Discussing Trump's tweets, Cuban said “He is an idiot. I don't care what they say. Right? I got a thick skin. They don't.”
Cuban said that it is not Trump's inexperience that is the problem saying, “No one is ever totally qualified to be the president. What it takes is leadership skills, so you know what you don't know…You're never going to know everything to be the president. You have to be smart enough to say, here's where my strengths are. Here's what I don't know, and let me find the best people to do that. And then listen to those people. You can make an argument that Donald Trump has hired some good people around him. Maybe some you don't love. They have hired good people, but they never listens. And if you are not willing to listen, if you are not willing to learn— the entire job — the only certainty of the job of president is the uncertainty. You don't know what's next.”
They added that Trump was “oblivious to life.”
“He has no self-awareness. They have no contextual awareness, but other than that, they are a great president.”

Strongly typed numeric data. The Ada datatype facility allows programmers to declare distinct integer types and distinct floating-point types to help prevent the misuse of numeric values. Different units of measure can be captured by different floating-point types such as Miles and Kilometers , for example; assigning a value of type Miles to a variable of type Kilometers would generate a compile-time error. This facility makes the programs intent clear and helps avoid subtle implicit conversion bugs.
and , for example; assigning a value of type to a variable of type would generate a compile-time error. This facility makes the programs intent clear and helps avoid subtle implicit conversion bugs. Scalar range constraints. Ada allows scalar variables to be declared with explicit range constraints. A check is made, typically at run time, to ensure that assigned values are within the specified bounds. Range constraints are instrumental in catching wild value errors and in facilitating formal proof of program properties. Generalizing this facility, Ada 2012 has introduced subtype predicates, allowing an arbitrary Boolean expression to be provided as part of a subtype declaration. The predicate is checked at specific points of execution, such as on assignment, and an exception raised if the predicate is False.
Array index checking. Array indexing in Ada is checked, raising a run-time exception when the index is out of bounds. Buffer overrun and similar vulnerabilities do not arise.
Integer overflow checking. In Ada, a signed integer arithmetic operation yielding a result that would exceed the largest integer value will raise a run-time exception rather than wrapping around to produce a negative value with large magnitude. Operations that produce a result lower than the most negative integer value received analogous treatment. This check prevents errors that can lead to vulnerabilities.
Safe pointers to declared objects. Ada allows access values, or pointers, to denote declared data objects, but provides several kinds of checks to ensure safety. First, an object that will be designated by an access value needs to be explicitly marked as aliased, to make its intent obvious to the human reader and to prevent the compiler from performing potentially unsafe optimizations. Second, Ada requires a scope depth check (typically at compile time) to prevent dangling references, i.e., to ensure that a pointer to a local variable does not have a longer lifetime than the variable itself.
Alternatives to dynamic allocation. Adas discriminated record facility, and more generally the bounded container types introduced in Ada 2005, allow the definition of flexible-length data structuresi.e., which can grow or shrink within specified boundswithout the need for dynamic allocation.
Restrictions on feature usage. Ada supplies a compiler directive, pragma Restrictions , that allows the programmer to specify features that are not being used. Based on the features so listed, the Ada implementation can supply simpler versions of run-time libraries that both simplify certification and result in smaller-footprint executables.
of this three-article series described how object-oriented programming (OOP) introduces a number of vulnerabilities that need to be mitigated if OOP is to be used successfully in high-integrity applications that require DO-178certification. Part 2 summarized the main elements of Adas OOP model. In this final installment, well explain how these features can help developers meet the high integrity challenge.Although Ada did not, strictly speaking, start out as an OOP environment, it included the concepts of packages, objects, and encapsulation, which lent themselves to object-oriented techniques. Subsequent releases, particularly Ada 95, added major OOP functionality such as classes/tagged types, inheritance, polymorphism, and dynamic dispatch, and Ada 2005built on that foundation. Now, Ada 2012boasts a number of new OOP-related facilities that support high-integrity development.Many of the features in Ada that help developers write safe and secure programs in general, also apply with object-orientated methodology. These features include:
There's so much wrong with Jennifer LeClaire‘s latest piece for Charisma, I'm not even sure where to begin. It's all about the radical atheist agenda…
I guess we should start with the headline:
Atheist Agenda Wants You to Turn Your Back on Christ
Well, yeah… that's kind of the point.
(Spoiler alert: The writers at Charisma want you to find Jesus, too!)
Moving on to the actual article:
Anything the gay agenda can do, the atheists can do better. That seems to be the unbeliever's mantra for 2013 as godless radicals rise up not only for recognition — and not only to tear down all things Christian in the public square — but to actually woo born-again Bible believers to the dark side.
I'm pretty sure LeClaire just argued that gay people want to convert you to gayness — that they can convert your sexual orientation — and atheists want to convert you even harder.
The “public square” comment is ridiculous, too, because it implies atheists want to eradicate Christianity everywhere. In fact, atheist groups only try to strike down instances of government endorsement or promotion of Christianity. If elected officials are pushing their faith illegally, we'll make sure the law is being followed. LeClaire should be thanking us for that, not berating us.
And that's just the first paragraph!
They prove atheists are interested in converting people by citing Peter Boghossian, author of the new book A Manual for Creating Atheists, a book that's literally about creating atheists:
Yes, it's actually a book that aims to equip nonbelievers with the skills they need to talk believers into willfully turning their back on Christ. This atheist is hoping to drive Christians into full-blown apostasy. Jesus is the truth. He's also the way and the life.
Well, shit. I'm convinced.
LeClaire also cites the Sunday Assembly:
It's a godless church. According to CBN, British comedians Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans founded the movement and plan to kick-start more anti-God assemblies in the U.S.
This is how you know LeClaire didn't even bother doing the slightest bit of research. She's using the Sunday Assembly as proof of the radical atheist agenda, a group that's explicitly *not* about promoting atheism and “won't tell you you're wrong if you” believe in the supernatural.
LeClaire also tosses me into their pile of evidence:
Some atheists are trying to position themselves as “friendly,” like Hemant Mehta, author of the Friendly Atheist blog who offered to raise money to cover the medical bills of a pastor who was attacked by a militant atheist.
Why do they have to put “friendly” in quotation marks…?
I guess they think if atheists try to be decent people, it's just part of a larger plan to destroy their faith.
(To which I can only say: How did they find out?!)
…
The whole article is laughable because what LeClaire appears to be most upset about is that atheists are finally gaining traction in the battle of persuasion. And if Christians can lose their faith because atheists made a few good points, then their faith wasn't really built on a solid foundation to begin with, was it?

Is it ethical to draw a line between animals we see as deserving “personhood” and those we see more than features of a landscape or the source of food on a plate? Is a dolphin more deserving of special consideration for its care than a pig?
I explored this question earlier this year in “When is a Person Not a Human? When it's a Dolphin, or Chimp, or…”
This issue is relevant to this blog in that any consideration of sustainable paths for human societies on a crowding planet has to account for how we get our food — particularly the meat that, for now at least, remains a centerpiece of diets once people emerge from deep poverty. (In their Sunday column, Nicholas Kristof, an omnivore raised on a farm in Oregon, explores society's slow shift toward improving conditions for the animals we rely on.)
David N. Cassuto, a Pace University law professor who specializes in environmental and animal law, offered the following “Your Dot” post digging in on a central issue underlying the concept of personhood — one's rights under the law:
Here's Professor Cassuto's contribution:
Before we debate whether and which animals should be persons under the law, we should first determine what personhood means and what it does. Legal personhood has historically proved a moving target. The etymology of “person” traces back to the Latin persona, meaning mask, especially the type worn by actors or those playing social roles. Only later did the concept evolve into the Roman idea of a bearer of legal rights. It's important, therefore, to understand the nature of a legal right. A right is a legally enforceable claim. Personhood is often viewed as a precursor to rights but the converse is much more true. One need not be a person in order to have rights; one rather needs rights in order to be a person. Unfortunately, it is not at all clear which rights elevate one to personhood. Animals, for example, have many different rights. They have the right to be protected from cruelty (unless they are agricultural animals) the right to sustenance and shelter (if they are domestic animals), the right to adequate habitat (if they are endangered), and the list goes on. Nevertheless, though corporations and boats are legal persons, for reasons that defy explanation, animals are not. Past attempts to differentiate humans from animals and thereby explain their disparate treatment before the law have taken many forms. Some, like Descartes, maintained that the difference lay with the capacity for language. Others based it on intellectual ability, self-consciousness or basic biology. None of these rationales withstands close analysis. Nonhuman language capability has been conclusively demonstrated in innumerable cases while differentiating based on intellect founders on the existence of cognitively impaired people whose humanity none would deny. Basic biology is also a thin reed on which to hang one's humanity and claim to personhood. To date, no quintessentially “human” characteristic has emerged to definitively set humans apart from other animals. This should not surprise, given that the human genome differs only minimally from that of a roundworm. In light of the foregoing, no one definition of person encompasses the range of legal entities with legitimate claims to its mantle. However, simply broadening the ambit of personhood will not solve the problem. Regardless of how wide its scope, personhood will always define itself through contrast with an excluded other. It requires those possessing the requisite characteristics to evaluate whether other beings do as well. In this sense, even as a broader conception of personhood validates other beings as worthy of moral considerations, it does so by evaluating whether their essence sufficiently resembles our own. Consequently, any attempt to frame a set of criteria for personhood begins with an inherently speciesist bias. One way to address this problem is by doing away with personhood as a dispositive legal category. As an umbrella term encompassing a cluster of traits, personhood obfuscates rather than clarifies the issue of moral and legal responsibility. Any discussion of rights and membership in the legal community would be better served by focusing on the components of the term rather than the term itself. Different traits demand different entitlements. Clustering them all beneath the term “personhood” invites imprecision. By contrast, separating the term into components allows the legal system to treat difference differently while still enabling access to the moral community. For example, acknowledging that animals have the right to be free from the grotesque exploitation of the industrial food apparatus does not require that we also grant them the right to vote. “Human” rights are just that. “Animal” rights should be something altogether different. Recognizing species differences need not mean asserting superiority but rather acknowledging and respecting otherness. Thus, replacing personhood with a cluster concept of rights offers a point of embarkation to a more coherent and egalitarian approach to our relationships with the nonhuman world.
At Pace, Cassuto recent hosted and introduced a highly relevant lecture by Steven M. Wise, a legal scholar focused on animals and rights, titled “Nonhuman Rights to Personhood.” I hope you'll read it, as well.
Cassuto's recent paper, “Meat Animals, Humane Standards & Other Legal Fictions,” is relevant, as well, but available online only by subscription.
BREAKING: U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states can no longer ban same-sex couples from getting married
Update:
Via Reuters:
The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that the U.S. Constitution provides same-sex couples the right to marry in a historic triumph for the American gay rights movement.
The court ruled 5-4 that the Constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law mean that states cannot ban same-sex marriages. With the ruling, gay marriage will become legal in all 50 states.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing on behalf of the court, said that the hope of gay people intending to marry “is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”
Kennedy, a conservative who often casts the deciding vote in close cases, was joined in the majority by the court's four liberal justices.
In a dissenting opinion, conservative Justice Antonin Scalia says the court's decision shows it is a “threat to American democracy.”
The ruling “says that my ruler and the ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court,” Scalia said.

Story highlights Air India deeply regrets "the tragic incident at Mumbai airport," airline chief says
The company says it follows "all standard safety procedures and parameters"
(CNN) An engineer at Mumbai airport died after being sucked into the engine of an Air India plane, the company said.
The deadly incident happened late Wednesday as the Airbus A319 was being towed backward from the parking bay in preparation for taxiing out, said Anil Mehta, an Air India official.
The engineer, Ravi Subramanian, was standing near the landing gear under the plane's nose as they supervised the process, Mehta told CNN.
Passengers had boarded the aircraft for a flight to the city of Hyderabad. It wasn't clear if any of them saw what happened.
Air India officials declined to give any further details, saying the country's civil aviation regulator is investigating the engineer's death.

Los Angeles County jail records indicate Thor is scheduled for a June 19 court appearance. It was not immediately clear whether it has obtained an attorney to represent them in the case.
Thor has acted the movies "Jurassic Park," "A Few Good Men," and "Hook," and the TV show "Star Trek: The Next Generation." They played Lewis Dodgson, who made a deal to purchase dinosaur embryos, in "Jurassic Park."
MILAN (AP) — Silvio Berlusconi's private disco featured aspiring show girls not only performing striptease acts as sexy nuns and nurses, but also dressed as President Barack Obama and a prominent Milan prosecutor whom the billionaire media mogul has accused of persecuting him, according to the first public sworn testimony by the Moroccan woman at the center of the scandal.
Karima El Mahroug's testimony Friday at the trial of three former Berlusconi aides accused with procuring them and other woman for prostitution confirms a sexually charged atmosphere at the parties of the then-sitting premier. They deny the charges. The trial is separate from the one in which Berlusconi is charged with paying for sex with a minor — El Mahroug when they were 17 — and trying to cover it up.

El Mahroug, now 20, said they attended about a half-dozen parties, and that after each, they handed them an envelope with up to 3,000 euros ($3,900) in denominations of 500. They said they later received 30,000 euros cash from the former premier paid through an intermediary — money that they told Berlusconi they wanted to use to open a beautician salon, despite having no formal training.
But they denied that Berlusconi had even given them 5 million euros ($6.43 million). They said they told acquaintances and even their father that they were going to receive such a large sum “as a boast,” but that it was a lie to make them seem more important.
The three Berlusconi aides — Emilio Fede, an executive in Berlusconi's media empire; Nicole Minetti, a former dental hygienist, showgirl and local politician; and talent agent Dario “Lele” Mora — are accused of recruiting women for prostitution at the parties and abetting prostitution, including of a minor.
El Mahroug has made carefully orchestrated statements to the media since the scandal broke but has never publicly given sworn testimony. Both they and Berlusconi deny having had sex.
Dressed soberly with their hair pulled back, El Mahroug said they first made contact with Berlusconi's inner circle when they participated in a beauty contest organized by Fede in Sicily when they were 16.
After that they made their way to Milan, hoping to find work. They said they tried to get work through another defendant's talent agency but didn't have proper identity documents. They wound up landing a job as a hostess in nightclubs, earning around 100 euros ($130) a night.

Eventually, they ran into Fede at a restaurant, where they reminded them of their promise in Sicily to help them Shortly thereafter, they were invited to a dinner party at Berlusconi's villa outside of Milan.
They testified that they met the premier that night — on Valentine's Day in 2010 — and that they gave them an envelope of 2,000 to 3,000 euros ($2,600 to $3,900), saying it was “a little help” and asking for their telephone number, which they gave him.
At that party, they said, they introduced themselves as Ruby and told other guests a fake tale that they were Egyptian, that their mother was a famous Arab singer and that they were related to then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. They were 17 at the time but had passed themselves off as being 23 or 24.
El Mahroug confirmed Friday what other witnesses have testified previously: At some of the soirees, young female party guests had dressed up like nuns and danced for Berlusconi and then stripped down to their underwear.

El Mahroug said Minetti, one of the defendants, had dressed up like a nun at that Feb. 14 party and lifted their costume to show off their legs as they danced in Berlusconi's in-house disco, which was outfitted with a lap-dance pole. El Mahroug demonstrated from their seat how Minetti had raised their hemline. They said Minetti eventually took off their costume and was in just their lingerie.
They said another girl dressed up alternatively as Obama or a Milan magistrate who is leading the prosecution against Berlusconi in the sex scandal, donning a red wig and the black robes worn by magistrates in Italy.
“The girls who were dressed in costumes approached them in a sensual way as they danced. They raised their skirts,” El Mahroug testified. They added: “I never saw contact.”

El Mahroug said they visited Berlusconi's mansion, Arcore, a half-dozen times, and that each time they were given an envelope with money, always in 500 euro bills ($645 each). The second evening they went they said they were given around 2,000 euros.
Prosecutors in Berlusconi's separate trial have said El Mahroug's testimony is unreliable and that they are relying on their sworn statements. The defense had initially called them as a witness, but then changed its strategy and didn't call them That trial is nearing a verdict and will reconvene May 24.
Haryana cadre IAS officer Ashok Khemka, who had cancelled the mutation of a land deal involving Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra, may be deputed to the Centre soon.
The Civil Services Board (CSB) headed by union cabinet secretary Ajit Kumar Seth has reportedly cleared their name for a central deputation despite the officer facing a charge sheet and vigilance inquiry in the Vadra land deal controversy.
Haryana state officials said, "The state government has not given them a vigilance clearance."
A CSB nod means that Khemka's name will now be put on the list for central staffing schemes.
Khemka, a 1991-batch Haryana cadre IAS officer had created a furore in 2012 when they cancelled the mutation of 3.5-acre land in Gurgaon's Shikohpur village, the contract that was sold by Vadra to realty major DLF.
Last September, the state government ordered Khemka to be chargesheeted for major penalty. They were held liable for administrative misconduct and overstepping jurisdiction in passing orders to cancel mutation of the 3.5-acre land and indulging in public criticism of the state's actions and policies.
The state government also ordered a probe by the vigilance bureau against Khemka for alleged irregularities in the purchase of 10,000 quintals of green gram during their tenure as managing director in Haryana Seed Development Corporation (HSDC). Khemka's supporters, however, allege the actions were intended to harass him.

We proudly announced today that the new LG flagship smartphone, the LG V30, includes Qnovo's adaptive charging technology. The V30 uses Qnovo's QNI solution, our most sophisticated algorithms to manage its lithium-ion battery. In this post, we open our doors to give our readers insight to our technology and QNI in particular.
As complex and exotic as the battery may seem, you, the consumer, care only about a handful of things.
First, will the battery last you a whole day of use, no marketing gimmicks?
Second, will it charge fast enough? You don't need blink-of-an-eye-charging but you don't want to wait long too.
Third, will it last you at least two years or more, given that you are paying a premium price?
And lastly, can you rely on that it will not risk your safety and the safety of those around you?
These attributes collectively define your overall battery experience; not one of them, but all of them together.
To last you a full day, the battery must have plenty of charge capacity, i.e., a lot of mAh. This is equal to a range between 3,000 to 3,500 mAh for today's crop of smartphones. Anything more than that will make the smartphone unwieldy or too thick. To fit a 3,000 mAh battery in the small physical space inside a smartphone means high energy density. Today's state of the art is near 650 Wh/l operating at a maximum voltage of 4.4 V. That's the first headache already. At this high voltage and high energy density, the battery is really not happy and needs a lot of caring. I mean a lot of caring!
Fast charging the battery amplifies all the concerns of high voltage and high energy density, and makes them a lot worse. And if you have to charge more than once a day, well, this battery will need even more caring.
High energy density, high voltage and fast charging together are the factors that make the battery fail before two years, and risk making your battery unsafe.
Therein lies the challenge. How do we care for the battery ? and why has this required level of care become so much more sophisticated than ever before ?
As the old adage goes, “You can't fix what you can't measure.”
This leads to an important and critical new concept for batteries: Measuring what is happening within the battery, all the time, in real time, and then deciding what to do. By “within” I mean the “chemistry” that is taking place inside the battery…the stuff that you don't see. This is called, in engineering terms, closed-loop feedback. Engineers know it, study it, and use it in countless situations.
Qnovo's software adapts to your smartphone a measurement technique widely used in battery laboratories. It is called electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (abbreviated as EIS). It helps our scientists understand what happens inside the battery without destroying it. Qnovo's innovation is in implementing EIS in your smartphone so that it is always monitoring your battery's internal chemical processes.
We announced earlier this year that the Qualcomm® Snapdragon 835 that powers the LG V30 includes hardware that accelerates Qnovo's algorithms. Indeed, the additional hardware in the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset extends the utility of EIS inside the smartphone. The hardware in this new chipset enables measurements and frequencies that were not available in older chipsets. Qnovo's QNI software takes advantage of this new hardware to gain deeper insight into the battery, again all in real time.
Now we get to the second portion of closed loop: What to do after making a measurement. As it turns out, and we thank science for that, charging the battery is a powerful knob to alter and affect what happens inside the battery. Qnovo's adaptive charging takes the information from the EIS measurement, and then adjusts the charging current to reduce and mitigate possible harmful reactions detected during previous measurements.
With QNI, this “closed loop” happens a lot faster than its sister software product, QNS. As a result, it is able to detect more potential problems and react appropriately. Throughout a single charge, QNS makes approximately 200 measurements on the battery, whereas QNI makes close to 20,000 measurements.
Over the past years, we have collected a gigantic database of measurements on batteries from the vast majority of battery manufacturers. We have tested large quantities of batteries under diverse and extreme conditions. This knowledge allows Qnovo to train our algorithms to make them more efficient and more accurate especially as battery materials continue to evolve.
The skeptic might ask, “Great, but how does it help me, the end user?”
The most important benefit that the user derives is the health of the battery. You get a healthy battery AND more capacity AND fast charging…in other words, the consumer gets a great battery experience encompassing the attributes mentioned at the beginning of this post.
You, the consumer, do not have to worry whether your usage might hurt the battery. You don't have to worry about fast charging because it might damage the battery. You don't have to worry about charging to less than full because it helps the battery's longevity. None of these should be your concerns and none should keep you thinking about the battery. Qnovo's adaptive charging takes care of these battery issues in the background, and gives you a healthy battery with the best user experience.
So, if you are in the market for a new smartphone, do consider an LG V30 and do enjoy its battery experience.
SA Liberals plan to scrap compulsory research project for Year 12 students
Updated
The Opposition said secondary students would no longer have to complete a research project as part of their South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) if it won next year's state election.
The Opposition said it planned also to offer senior students a number of entrepreneurial subjects and create three high schools specialising in that area.
Liberal Leader Steven Marshall said the research project would remain available to students, but they could have the option of completing a fifth Year 12 subject instead.
"We don't think it serves the students of South Australia by making it compulsory," they said.
"We've had a huge amount of complaints about it and now we've responded by saying from 2016 the research project will be optional for SACE students."
Mr Marshall said many South Australian students left to pursue apprenticeships before finishing Year 12.
If elected, they said the Opposition would fund apprentices to do school subjects after work hours so they could complete their SACE.
"At the moment you have the option of doing a school-based apprenticeship where you are at school full-time and you go off to do your apprenticeship part-time so you clock up some hours, but it's a pretty slow rate," they said.
"We want to give people the option of leaving school at the end of Year 11, embarking upon their career, starting their apprenticeship and then, most importantly, completing their SACE part-time."

Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert has hailed Raheem Sterling, predicting the teen sensation will have an 'unbelievable' season as the Reds prepare for the new campaign.
Lambert was speaking as the Reds prepared to return home following their two-week tour of North America, where Sterling has carried on the fantastic form they showed during the second-half of last season's Barclays Premier League campaign.
Those performances saw the 19-year-old secure a place alongside Lambert in England's World Cup squad in Brazil. Now, as club teammates, Liverpool's new No.9 believes the winger can carry on where they left off as the Reds prepare for another assault on the league title.
"I've been really impressed by Razza [Raheem] on this trip and if they keep on progressing the way they have done over the past year or two he's going to have an unbelievable season," said Lambert.
"I don't want to put pressure on them but I think they can handle anything that comes their way. He's a top lad as well.
"Nothing fazes them and that's full credit to the management. The manager has created an environment for the young kids to go and thrive and you can see the benefits of that."
As well as Sterling, Lambert was part of the same England squad that contained fellow Liverpool players Glen Johnson, Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and the recently signed Adam Lallana.
Spending an additional fortnight away with their new teammates in the US has given Lambert the perfect opportunity to fully integrate into the Reds' squad, and strike up further understanding with fellow striker, Daniel Sturridge.
"We played and trained a bit together with England so I kind of know Daniel's game," Lambert said.
"I'm learning more and more about them each day. He's a special player and has got so much about their game.
"He's a top player and it makes my job a lot easier playing with someone as good as that."

Quick Thesis:
Goldman is trading for the cheapest price in its history as a public company.
Goldman has been hit from every angle recently. Some of the challenging factors include subpar loan demand, low M&A, IPO and other investment banking business, regulatory threats, market deleveraging, lower company leverage, constant criticism etc. This has resulted in one of the world's premier investment banks trading at less than 75% of tangible book. Goldman is worth over $200 per share and investors are ignoring many positive factors going forward.
Over the course of Goldman's history they have been very nimble in shifting assets to the highest ROI areas, assuming that ROE will be at these very depressed levels forever is not an accurate conclusion. Goldman is trading at a large discount to the liquidating value of its assets that are nearly all mark to market. Investors are ignoring the opportunities and tailwinds that exist.
There is a huge potential to grow significantly overseas and competition has been reduced from the financial crisis. In addition, the reduction of the firm's temporary liquidity will add a few billion to the bottom line. Increased leverage and a return to more risk taking will also boost results. Large share buybacks at such an advantageous price will further enhance value.
Since Goldman's IPO in 1999 through 2011 book value per share has grown 16% per year, Return on equity has averaged 18.5% and pretax margins has averaged 31%. Keep in mind that these numbers include the recession years 2008-2011. From 2008-2011 book value per share grew 15% and return on equity averaged 12%. Goldman has never lost money as a public company except for the 4th quarter of 2008.
Tangible book value per share was $124 at the end of the first quarter. At 75% of book value, this is the cheapest Goldman has ever traded at except right after the Lehman bankruptcy. In May of 1999 Goldman Sachs went public at $70 per share. Thirteen years later the stock is only 35% above its IPO price but tangible book value per share has increased from $23 in 1999 to $124 today. In addition, earnings per share has increased from $5.60 per share in 1999 to $15.22 in 2010. According to Boykin Curry's Value Investing Congress presentation, the liquidating value of Goldman a year ago was $150 per share.
If book value grows 12% going forward (even at a 12% ROE book value will grow faster because of accretive buybacks), tangible book value will grow to $174 by the end of 2014. At a multiple of 1.2-1.4x book value the company is worth $208-$243 when very depressed growth levels are assumed. If Goldman is able to generate ROE's of 14-16%, it's worth up to $270 per share.
Goldman is trading cheap because of the harsh criticism they have received, the current depressed earnings and because investors assume new regulation will hurt them significantly. However all of these factors are not permanent issues. Investors are completely missing that Goldman has many opportunities and tailwinds going forward.
There is a huge potential to grow significantly overseas and competition has been reduced from the financial crisis. In addition, the reduction of temporary liquidity will add a few billion to the bottom line. Increased leverage and a return to more risk taking will also boost results.
Share buybacks at such an advantageous price are frosting on the cake. Goldman repurchased 9% of its stock last year. Due to options exercises they reduced shares outstanding by 3%. Goldman repurchased a little under 1% of its stock in the first quarter. They said buybacks will continue.
Buffett was confident enough in their business to invest back during the financial crisis. Berkshire received 43.5 million in warrants to purchase stock at $115 per share. The stock is trading for 20% less than Buffett's investment.

on Have you ever been so stressed out it makes you sick?
Between last night and this morning, my stress level reached a point where I ended up sick. After I took the boys to school this morning, I started not feeling well. I thought that maybe I was just hungry or something but after eating breakfast (the same yogurt medley I have almost every morning) I felt worse.
As life has become more challenging and stressful, I've started dealing with acid reflux. It doesn't always happen often but it tends to show up when I'm really upset or stressed out.
It's fair to say that I have a lot on my plate and there are times when it just becomes too much.
Between the worries about now needing a new car, dealing with the mortgage company, not sleeping last night, worrying about Christmas, getting Gavin to Cleveland and spending the morning dealing with screaming, it was just too much.
We rescheduled Dr. Reynolds because there hasn't been any changes for Gavin in regards to their medications. The idea was that I could get some sleep, take some Tums and wake up feeling better, so I could drive to the Cleveland Clinic.
Unfortunately, the nap didn't help and I was feeling nauseated.
Anyway, Lizze rescheduled Cleveland and while I'm not happy about that, there wasn't really anything I could do. I was not feeling up to driving and so there wasn't much choice.
Everything is rescheduled and we can move forward. I wish that I could have knocked this stuff out today but sometimes things don't go as planned. There are times when pushing myself is the right thing to do, but this was not one of those times.
I need some time to decompress and center myself a bit. Dealing with stress isn't something that's ever going to go away, and like anyone else, I could benefit from adding additional coping skills to my tool box for dealing with stress…
Anyway, how many of you have ever dealt with something similar?
DESPITE queries over the effectiveness of their 50-disposal game against Collingwood, Hawthorn midfielder Tom Mitchell is a deserving selection in the round eight Teams of the Week, brought to you by Accor Hotels.
Mitchell became just the seventh player to reach the magical milestone, made up of 22 kicks and 28 handballs.
Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley chose not to tag the Hawks onballer as they did their damage by "stealth", but Mitchell's 22 contested possessions underlined how important they were to their side's early dominance.
Magpies skipper Scott Pendlebury was the other dominant player on the field, with the skipper's leadership and never-say die attitude a huge reason behind Collingwood's 43-point comeback.
Other midfield spots were at a premium, as Seb Ross, Josh Kennedy, Dustin Martin and Joel Selwood can all count themselves as mighty unlucky not to be picked.
Essendon's Michael Hurley was a lock at centre-half back after a stellar game – one of four Bombers to make the team – against the Eagles.
• Eight things we learned from round nine
Michael Johnson (Fremantle): It seemed age might have left the veteran wearied at the start of the season but they have responded in fine fashion. Continually cut off Carlton's forays forward on Sunday and had 10 intercept possessions among their 15 disposals.
Alex Rance (Richmond): It's tough to blame the gun defender for their side's run of four losses. They were superb in winning 19 disposals and match-high stats for one-percenters (16) and intercept possessions (10).
Nathan Wilson (GWS): The dashing defender started the chain that saw the Giants pinch an extraordinary win by booting it into the middle of the ground from the kick-in and gained a match-high 765 metres from their 20 disposals.
Rory Laird (Adelaide): Unsurprisingly, the backman was once again brilliant for the Crows. They racked up 37 disposals, used the ball well and sparked much of their side's counterattack and looks on track to win a berth in the Virgin Australia AFL All Australian team.
Michael Hurley (Essendon): Sitting out for a year with a doping ban hasn't hurt the Bomber's form. Against West Coast, they finished with 26 disposals and a game-high nine intercept possessions.
Jake Lloyd (Sydney): Even as the Swans started the season slowly, the former rookie racked up the ball at will. They finished with 35 disposals and their hard running meant their teammates always had an option to kick to.
David Zaharakis (Essendon): A return to form for the 2011 club champion continued Sunday afternoon at Etihad Stadium, when they had their best game for a while. They picked up 31 disposals and seven tackles.
Scott Pendlebury (Collingwood): Overcoming a 43-point deficit against the Hawks probably wouldn't have happened without the skipper's contribution in their first game as a father. Their class became more obvious as the game wore on and finished with 36 disposals, 13 score involvements and 691m gained.
A brilliant handball released Scott Pendlebury who was never going to miss! #AFLPiesHawks pic.twitter.com/kKztQbSE5E — AFL (@AFL) May 20, 2017
Dan Hannebery (Sydney): Memories of a slow start to the season for the star Swan will fade away quickly if they keep producing performances like their 30-disposal effort against St Kilda. The two goals they slotted in the first quarter added extra punch to their game.
WATCH: Saints had no plan for Dan and Buddy
Michael Walters (Fremantle): Walters has been in superb form and they continued their stellar run against the Blues. They ignited the Dockers with three goals in the third term to take the game away from Carlton and finished with 27 disposals to stamp their name all over Fremantle's win.
WATCH: Walters' wonderful term turns the tide
Joe Daniher (Essendon): Another brilliant game from the in-form forward, as they bagged five goals in Essendon's big win over West Coast. Got their confidence up early by nailing their first set-shot within the first minute of the game. They then kicked three more snaps to end the first-half with four goals to set up the Bombers' win.
WATCH: Joey shines as Dons dismantle Eagles
Tom Lynch (Adelaide): Outworked opponent Marco Paparone and was an excellent link between the midfield and the forward line. The hard-running Crow collected 23 disposals, eight marks and kicked three goals. Lynch's first goal from a tight angle on the boundary line, that has been nominated for the Coates Hire Goal of the Year, underlined their class.
Tom Lynch kicked an absolute beauty, but the goal umpire was taken down in the process. #AFLLionsCrows pic.twitter.com/NwU6EwkBHI — AFL (@AFL) May 20, 2017
Mitch Hannan (Melbourn): The young forward was Melbourne's most likely scoring option in another disappointing loss. Hannan, who stands up at just 189cm, took three contested marks and continued to create a contest when some of the other Demons forwards couldn't. Kicked three goals in their best performance at AFL level.
Mitch Hannan was everywhere in the second term! #AFLDeesNorth pic.twitter.com/Rr1cZVevbq — AFL (@AFL) May 21, 2017
Ben Brown (North Melbourne): Showed that they can carry North Melbourne's forward line with a bag of five goals, to go with six marks (five inside 50 and two contested). The Demons had few answers for Brown's mix of height and competitiveness, as they drew plenty of attention for their Dennis Lillee-style set-shot run up.
Eddie Betts (Adelaide): Not your typical Eddie Betts goal frenzy that we have become accustomed to seeing, but what they did, they did very well. Kicked three goals and contributed with four goal assists (including setting up debutants Hugh Greenwood and Jordan Gallucci for goals).
Zac Smith (Geelong): Bounced back from a terrible performance against Essendon the previous week to play their most influential game in Geelong colours. Finished with a career-high 25 disposals and a personal best 48 hit-outs, as well as eight clearances and 10 tackles, to be a key figure in the Cats' desperately-needed victory.
Patrick Dangerfield (Geelong): Despite playing with sore ribs, Dangerfield was at their brilliant best against the Dogs. Their stat line looked pretty – 36 disposals, 10 clearances and four goals. But it was their intent to hunt the opposition (12 tackles) and set an aggressive tone for their team that was equally noteworthy.
Tom Mitchell (Hawthorn): The opposing coaches may have squabbled over whether Mitchell had a major impact on the game, but 50 disposals is 50 disposals. Became only the seventh player to reach that milestone, with 22 contested possessions and eight tackles topping off an exceptional individual game.
Ben Cunnington (North Melbourne): Looked to be in a bit of strife after they injured their knee in the first quarter, but returned at the start of the second term and quickly became one of the most influential players on the ground. Their crisp handballing to release teammates into space was a feature, as they ended the day with 26 disposals, eight clearances and one goal.
Lachie Neale (Fremantle): Picking up 37 disposals and a goal and playing a pivotal role in helping overhaul a brave Carlton outfit merits attention from the football world. They were massive in tight, winning 20 contested possessions and eight clearances.
Mitch Wallis (Western Bulldogs): Playing in their first game since suffering a horrific broken leg suffered in round 18 last season, Bulldogs midfielder Mitch Wallis was outstanding during the Cats' first-half onslaught and in their side's second-half revival. The tough onballer gathered 26 disposals and two goals, both of which came as the Bulldogs charged back into the game in the third term.
The fans' pick
Fan vote: Zach Merrett (Essendon): The young gun beat out Richmond's Dustin Martin in the Twitter fan vote, 65 per cent to 35 per cent. They were typically creative and damaging with the football and collected 37 disposals in an integral performance.

Mount Knowledge is a “school” established by Canadian Erwin Sniedzins in China that uses a so-called “Knowledge Generator” to train learners and local ELT/ESL teachers.
Through their school, they were able to market the learning technique as something they supposedly learned through years of research from Tibetan monks, according to the company's website.
The company sells a software that claims to “enable people to learn 32% better and up to 300% faster with over 80% retention in real time.”
In their Twitter account, they claim to be a professor at Hebei University where they teach T21 –
Sniedzins' LinkedIn profile describes themselves as an “Artificial Intelligence Gamification Patent Inventor, Keynote Speaker, Professor, Bestselling Author and Award-winning Poet.” It was, however, later edited to remove the part where he's an Award-winning Poet and a Bestselling Author.
Their credentials all sound really impressive until it was recently exposed that the company's celebrated founder bought a fake degree from a diploma mill.
According to CBC, Sniedzins was issued a degree by Kings Lake University “based on their previous life experience and professional accomplishments” for just $8,100.
CBC Marketplace investigation had earlier revealed that Kings Lake University, along with other fake online schools, were selling fake degrees.
“I don't necessarily like to pay $30,000 to get a master's when I feel I already have the knowledge,” Sniedzins was quoted as saying.
Sniedzins said they found the diploma mill in 2014 after searching the internet for a master's degree that would “validate” their professional and life experience.
After contacting Kings Lake University over the phone, they were asked to send some proof of their professional and life experience, which immediately qualified them for a degree.
“To me, that's the direction that things are going. So I figured these guys were the vanguard of that type of stuff.”
As it turned out, Kings Lake University is just one of the online schools run by the Pakistan-based fake degree mill Axact. None of the schools reportedly have a physical address, and they all use fake accreditation bodies for citations and stock images for faculty photos.
Yet, despite many telling signs, including the fact that an affidavit certifying their degree was signed by former U.S. secretary of state John Kerry, Sniedzins claimed that they thought the university was authentic.
“It felt like they were more legit than the other ones. Their website's pretty good. And when you phone, you get someone there,” they said.
Upon learning that their master's degree work was actually fake, the “professor” claimed that it made them “angry”.
“I really feel stupid if that's the case, and I'm angry about it,” Sniedzins said. “It's like counterfeit money.”
Campaigners call for day of action in November and strike in 2016 over ‘biggest attack on public education in decades'
Students are stepping up their campaign against government reforms for higher education with a series of demonstrations, sit-ins and strikes planned for the coming months.
Campaigners who organised a major protest in London earlier this month have called for another day of action on 26 November and a two-day strike in the new year.
Jo Johnson's university reforms: reactions from the experts Read more
Deborah Hermanns, from the National Campaign against Fees and Cuts, which is organising the protests, said: “The reforms introduced by this Tory government represent the biggest attack on public education in decades. As a result of the further marketisation proposed in the higher education green paper and cuts to maintenance grants, thousands of students will be priced out of education and the whole structure of the sector will change, creating a multi-tier system and attacking poorer students and institutions.”
Ten thousand people took to the streets of central London this month to voice their anger over the government's “attacks on free education”. The demonstration ended in scuffles with the police, who were accused of excessive violence by some of the protesters.
Since then the government has unveiled its higher education green paper, which students say represents a concerted attack on the purpose of free education.
Activists are now organising a two-day strike in February next year which could see thousands of students walk out of lectures at campuses around the country.
The campaign has received backing from the top of the Labour party. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, spoke at this month's rally, and many of the students taking a lead in the campaign were involved in Jeremy Corbyn's leadership bid.
For the first time, Tufts University biologists have reported that bioelectrical signals are necessary for normal head and facial formation in an organism and have captured that process in a time-lapse video that reveals never-before-seen patterns of visible bioelectrical signals outlining where eyes, nose, mouth, and other features will appear in an embryonic tadpole.
The Tufts research with accompanying video and photographs will appear July 18 online in advance of publication in the journal Developmental Dynamics.
The Tufts biologists found that, before the face of a tadpole develops, bioelectrical signals (ion flux) cause groups of cells to form patterns marked by different membrane voltage and pH levels. When stained with a reporter dye, hyperpolarized (negatively charged) areas shine brightly, while other areas appear darker, creating an "electric face."
"When a frog embryo is just developing, before it gets a face, a pattern for that face lights up on the surface of the embryo," said senior author Dany S. Adams, Ph.D. Adams is a research associate professor in the Department of Biology in the Tufts School of Arts and Sciences and a member of the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology. "We believe this is the first time such patterning has been reported for an entire structure, not just for a single organ. I would never have predicted anything like it. It's a jaw dropper."
Tufts Post Doctoral Associate Laura N. Vandenberg, Ph.D., was first author of the paper entitled "V-ATPase-dependent ectodermal voltage and pH regionalization are required for craniofacial morphogenesis." Ryan D. Morrie, a biology major in the School of Arts and Sciences, was second author.
Scientific Serendipity
The discovery was a case of scientific serendipity. Adams has spent years studying bioelectrical patterning and left-right developmental differences. Them frequent research tool is a camera hooked up to a microscope that sends images to a computer.
One evening in September 2009 Adams was making time-lapse movies of early stage tadpole development. The images were coming out particularly clearly -- no small achievement when filming tiny living creatures. They decided to leave the camera on overnight even though they anticipated that as the developing embryos began to move, the images would likely become too blurred to be useful.
When Adams arrived the next morning, the image on the computer monitor was out of focus as expected. But when they finished processing the rest of the images, they found they were clear. The movies were, they say, "unlike anything I had ever seen. I was completely blown away. I think I thought something like, 'OK, I know what I'll be studying for the next 20 years.'"
The imagery revealed three stages, or courses, of bioelectric activity.
First, a wave of hyperpolarization (negative ions) flashed across the entire embryo, coinciding with the emergence of cilia that enable the embryos to move. Next, patterns appeared that matched the imminent shape changes and gene expression domains of the developing face. Bright hyperpolarization marked the folding in of the surface, while both hyperpolarized and depolarized regions overlapped domains of head patterning genes. In the third course, localized regions of hyperpolarization formed, expanded and disappeared, but without disturbing the patterns created during the second stage. At the same time, the spherical embryo began to elongate.
The Tufts team found that disrupting bioelectric signaling by inhibiting ductin (a protein that is part of the machinery that transports hydrogen ions) correlated with craniofacial abnormalities. Some embryos grew two brains rather than one; others had thickened optic nerves or lacked normal nasal or jaw development. Interrupting the ion flux also altered the bioelectric patterns on the embryos' surface and expression of important face patterning mRNAs (messenger RNA that acts as a blueprint for proteins).
"Our research shows that the electrical state of a cell is fundamental to development. Bioelectrical signaling appears to regulate a sequence of events, not just one," said Laura Vandenberg. "Developmental biologists are used to thinking of sequences in which a gene produces a protein product that in turn ultimately leads to development of an eye or a mouth. But our work suggests that something else -- a bioelectrical signal -- is required before that can happen. "
Adams and Vandenberg note that more research is needed to discover if bioelectrical signaling works the same in frogs as in other animals, including people, and if an "electric face" exists in human development. However, they believe that study of such signaling holds great potential.
"Studying bioelectrical signaling has led us to a different, and broader, way of thinking about diseases like cancer, birth defects and tissue regeneration," Adams notes. "Potentially we can find electrical switches that turn on entire developmental cascades rather than having to find many specific tools that turn on many specific genes within that cascade, as is the current approach with gene therapy. After all, we already have tools for regulating some of these bioelectrical signals, such as drugs that prevent acid reflux by controlling potassium and hydrogen ions."
Funding for this research came from the National Institutes of Health, a NIH National Research Service Award, and a Tufts Russell L. Carpenter Summer Internship for undergraduate Ryan Morrie. Morrie will continue to work on the project as a Poskitt Fellow with the Department of Biology.

Where did they go?"After observing the scene frame by frame I can safely say that they let Cinder take their place and walked awaybut in the next shot they had completely vanished.Either they were no longer relevant to the scene and therefore they didn't bother showing them again (the most likely reason)or then they put Waldo to shame. I'd like to think they left the party, but not before dreaming of a dance with Cinder Onee-sama.The next comic will be more lighthearted again, I promise.

There have been a number of noteworthy accountants in cinema over the years: The Duke in Midnight Run, Loretta in Moonstruck, Andy in The Shawshank Redemption, Henry in The Royal Tenenbaums — I could go on. But while all of those accountants played pivotal roles in their respective films, none of those films were called The Accountant. And due to the rule that, if you are making the definitive movie about something, you have to call it The [Something] — those movie accountants cannot be the definitive movie portrayals of what it's like to be an accountant.
As a result, the gap between “what we know about being an accountant” and “what we want to know about being an accountant” has remained agonizingly large. Who are these people? What makes them tick? What makes them … them? Either no one knew, or no one was talking.
But with Friday's release of The Accountant, starring Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick and Jeffrey Tambor a little and Jon Bernthal Is A STAR™, everything is poised to change.
I saw Gavin O'Connor's film last week, and was enthralled. On one level, it was a movie about Ben Affleck being smart after all and knowing about math and philosophy and owning an original Renoir and post-investing in gold bricks and Gus Van Sant didn't write a word of Good Will Hunting not one word that's a bullshit rumor go fuck yourself.
But on another level, I swear to god, it kind of was a movie about accounting.
Every minute of the film felt like a genuine “moment” — a peeling-back of the accounting curtain that had been pulled over my eyes for so long. Oh, I thought, when Affleck's accountant hit the smiley-faced micropumpkin between the eyes with a long-distance sniper rifle from over a mile out. That's what happens. Ahhh, I said to myself, after Affleck's accountant took out an elite hit squad with the back part of a casual acquaintance's toilet. Now I get it. OK — of course. That's how that works. It was dense, sure, but it was also edifying and fun. After seeing The Accountant, I realized that I was now one of the first people in the entire world to know what being an accountant was like. And that felt amazing.
But then the strangest thing happened. I started to hear rumors. I started to hear that some of what was portrayed in The Accountant … well: It may not have been strictly accurate. The possibility hit me like a ton of bricks. After all of the waiting and all of the excitement: I realized that I still might not know what being an accountant is like.
Lost, I went searching for answers, and where I should have gone years ago: straight to the source. I spoke to a real-life accountant — one who has worked for a Big Four accounting firm, and who agreed to talk with us under the condition of anonymity. I asked them to separate fact from fiction. What does The Accountant get wrong about accounting? And what does it get right?
Here is everything they told me:
FACT: Accountants stay in great shape.
One of the biggest stretches of The Accountant, right off the bat, seems to be that Ben Affleck is so … buff. I mean, so buff. I mean, let's just say it: They finished Batman, and they liked how they looked, and they said, “This is me now.” And good for him.
But look at him:
That's not an accountant.
Or is it? Our accountant assured me that Affleck's body actually checks out — and that they themselves also stays in shape.
“A normal biceps day for me, I'd say, is three sets of 20-pound curls,” our accountant told me, without hesitation. “And I'm doing that twice a week. Sorry, my fiancée is looking at me and she's saying, ‘That's a good week.' [Asks fiancée] Do I ever do any back and shoulder exercises? … Oh, yeah, so, for shoulders, I'll do three sets of shoulder presses with, like, a 15-pound weight. For chest, typical day, probably 40 push-ups. Two sets of 20.”
FACT: An accountant would say hi to Anna Kendrick if they were sitting on a bench outside next to them on a lunch break.
In one of the film's pivotal scenes, Affleck and Kendrick bond on an outdoor bench over lunch after they strike up a conversation.
I asked our accountant if this was even remotely realistic.
“I'm trying to imagine this scenario,” they said. “If we're sitting on a bench … I think I would [say hi]. I've seen celebrities before, and I don't try to bother them. But if they were just sitting on a bench and not with someone? Yeah, I would say hi … or whatever.”
And yet our accountant does have a bone to pick with the film's BYO-lunch vibes. “Lunch would be Seamless,” they say with confidence.
FACT: Accountants have a soft spot for Anna Kendrick.
But it isn't just lunch. Another implausibility in The Accountant seems to be its attempt at conjuring romantic chemistry between Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick.
And yet our source confirms the film's position: The couple makes sense. Or at least: Accountants definitely have a thing for Anna Kendrick.
“I'm very ‘for' Anna Kendrick,” our accountant said. “I think she's hot. They seem like she's down to earth. You don't see them in the tabloids. It seems like they try to be an actor, and then does their appearances. We don't see them trying to be public out there, like, an Angelina Jolie–type thing. She's talented.”
FICTION: If an accountant is doing accounting on a whiteboard in a windowed conference room, and they run out of room on the whiteboard, he'll use the windows in the conference room, like in ‘A Beautiful Mind.'
In another pivotal scene, we see Affleck's Christian Wolff pull an all-nighter while working on a big case at a client site. But this isn't just your standard … cocaine-and-doughnuts, midtier accountant all-nighter. This is one of those “go John Forbes Nash Jr.'s Ghost–level apeshit on your client's probably benevolent but on the other hand maybe the nicest guy in the room has a murderous plan to cake up before taking the company public, I've seen it happen before, I'm telling you, decade-spanning accounting problem” all-nighters.
And the film knows just what's up. This is their one chance to make accounting seem cool. And so they milk it for all it's worth. Numbers flying everywhere … an overbearing soundtrack … whisper-speed-counting on whisper-speed-counting on [extremely whisper-speed-counting voice] whisper-speed-counting. It's like the training scene in Creed but if the kids on the bikes were dry-erase markers and at the end of the workout they went up to Anna Kendrick and said, “Look what I did.”
Anyway, it's a pretty gripping scene. But it also feels like a bit of a stretch. On the windows — really?
“Wouldn't happen,” our accountant told us. “I would take a picture [of the work] and wipe it off the board and reuse it.”
FACT: Accountants are good at puzzles.
Affleck's accountant is incredible at puzzles: They do them in minutes — and they do them upside down. Does this check out?
“I'm pretty good at puzzles, I would say,” our accountant told us. “[I've had experience] doing them with my baby nieces and nephews. It was a couple years ago. It was a picture of, like, a bench, or … not, it was like a lion, or an animal or something like that.” Asked to rate themselves at puzzles on a scale of 1 to 10, our accountant was firm. “At that puzzle? I would rate myself a 10.”
So it checks out.
FACT: Accountants trust John Lithgow.
One of the biggest tactical missteps that Affleck's Wolff makes in the film is placing too much trust in Lamar Black, a robotics company founder played by John Lithgow. For such a smart guy, it's a pretty rookie mistake: Lithgow is the most famous actor of the movie's potential villains, by far — and the only really viable choice for its Big Bad. It becomes plainly obvious the film is turning them heel around the half-hour mark.
Is it believable that a genius like Wolff would miss these warning signs and trust John Lithgow a prohibitive amount?
“Sure,” our accountant answered, when asked if they trust John Lithgow.
I pressed for more. Why the trust?
“He's been around for a while, in the public sphere,” our accountant offered. “And I've never heard anything bad about him. When I was at the JCC growing up, 3rd Rock From the Sun was on the TV there.”
FICTION: Accounts have extensive combat training.
But out of all of The Accountant's litany of implausibilities, the toughest one to negotiate is probably its decision to let Ben Affleck's accountant go Full Jason Bourne. It's just not necessary. Like: My dude is already a BUFF GENIUS MATH WIZARD with movie-star looks and a Midwestern disposition. Did we really also need to give them a combat fighter rating of “Deadshot x Wolverine”?
“No,” our accountant told me, point-blank, when asked if accountants are raised from childhood to be undefeatable, virtuoso killing machines. “Not true.” As far as real-life fighting experience, our accountant tells me, “I got into a couple of fights in middle school. I got into a fight on the bus because this guy was trying to hit on my girlfriend. I guess it wasn't really a fight — I mean, I punched the kid and then our bus stop happened.”
Did the kid back off? “Yeah.”
Did they hit on our accountant's girlfriend again? “You know what, I think they did.”
An earlier version of this story erroneously included a photo of Ben Affleck from The Town; it has been replaced with an image from The Accountant.
Reddit has published new data on the number of piracy takedown notices the company receives. During the past year, copyright holders sent 3,294 DMCA takedown requests to the community-driven platform. Of these takedown notices a surprisingly high number were rejected, 81 percent of the total.
With millions of pageviews per day, Reddit is without doubt one of the most visited sites on the Internet.
The community-oriented platform has “subreddits” dedicated to pretty much every topic you can think of, including several dedicated to online piracy and related issues.
While the vast majority remain within the boundaries of the law, on occasion users post copyright-infringing material. This means that, like any user-generated site of its size, Reddit also has to process a steady stream of takedown requests from rightsholders.
To give the public insight into the process and volume, Reddit regularly publishes a transparency report. In the most recent report, published a few days ago, the company outlines the number of DMCA takedown notices received and how many of these were “valid.”
“For a request to be valid, it must comply with the statutory requirements outlined in the DMCA,” Reddit explains.
“Each DMCA takedown notice is reviewed carefully and, in circumstances where content is actually hosted on our servers, we assess whether the existence of the content on Reddit can fall under an exception, such as ‘fair use' of the copyrighted material.”
If the company believes that the reported content might be covered by an exemption under copyright law, they contact the copyright holder asking for additional information. If the claim turns out to be legitimate, it is then removed.
Unlike some other sites and services, Reddit doesn't blindly remove a posting that links to copyrighted content hosted on an external site. The company previously stated that “links do not generally infringe copyright.”
This is definitely a different approach than other companies, including Google, take, and it's likely to be reflected in the numbers as well.
So how much content was removed in 2016?
According to the transparency report, Reddit received 3,294 copyright removal requests over the entire year. Not really an impressive number compared to a service like Google, but substantial nonetheless.
The rejection rate is without a doubt impressive. The company says that it was required to remove content from the site in 610 instances, which is 19 percent. That means that of all DMCA requests, 81 percent was rejected.
That's quite a significant percentage. At Google, for example, more than 90 percent of all reported content is removed.
While the number of takedown requests Reddit receives pales in comparison to other Internet services, it's good to see that the company carefully reviews all notices to prevent unwarranted censorship. It will be interesting to see how the volume of requests and the removal rate changes over time.
Diego Maradona is going to Harvard University
The World Cup 1986 winner, who had been banned from the US for 22 years, is expected to give a talk to students in the first few months of 2017
legend Diego Maradona has revealed that he's been invited to give a talk at prestigious American university Harvard.
The former and playmaker, who hauled their nation to World Cup glory in 1986, had been banned from entering the US since they tested positive for doping.
Icardi is a traitor & he'll pay - Maradona
Maradona was denied a visa to visit Disneyland in 2013, but in December 2016 their long-running ban from the country was overturned 22 years after their 1994 World Cup shame - and Harvard has acted quickly to offer them an opportunity to give a lecture.
"Dear Mr Maradona," the letter to the 56-year-old from Harvard University begins. "We would like to invite you to give a talk at Harvard University in the context of the course 'The Global Game: Soccer, Politics and Popular Culture', which is being offered during the Spring semester of 2017.
"Your presence at Harvard would constitute a formidable opportunity for our students and for the entire academic community to learn about the life and feats of the best player in history, and will serve as the most perfect supplement to our lectures on the history, sociology and aesthetics of soccer."
In addition to travelling to the US to visit Harvard University in early 2017, Maradona is also reportedly going to the country to pursue a fraud lawsuit brought against ex-wife Claudia Villafane.
Maradona visited Oxford University, UK, in 1995, a visit documented by this classic footage taken a year after they were ignominiously booted out the 1994 World Cup.
Since their ill-fated time as coach, in recent years Maradona has taken to working closely with new FIFA president Gianni Infantino and will reportedly be offered a role at former club Napoli once they settle a decades-old tax bill of €39 million.
The House of Representatives is taking legal action to make sure that federal agencies don't release congressional records to the public through the Freedom of Information Act.
The move, which came Friday evening in a lawsuit demanding access to discussions about health care reform between the Trump administration and Congress, threatens to cut off a mechanism liberal watchdog groups were using to gain insight into closed-door negotiations on a variety of policy issues.
In legal papers filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, House General Counsel Thomas Hungar said the move to protect congressional correspondence was authorized by a House body known as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group. While the panel of top House leaders has divided in the past on sensitive issues, Hungar wrote that they “voted unanimously to authorize this intervention … to protect the institutional interests of the House.”

A letter calling on the province to keep protesters 150 metres away from abortion clinics and health care providers who provide abortion services has been signed by eight reproductive rights advocacy groups, including one from Kitchener.
Lyndsey Butcher, executive director of the Shore Centre — formerly Planned Parenthood — said new legislation being drafted by Attorney General Yasir Naqvi is based on laws in other provinces, which mandate protesters must stay 50 metres away.
"Fifty metres only really pushes people ... across the street, and because patients are either walking into the clinic or are getting dropped off by taxis or by friends, they still tend to come into contact with protesters," Butcher said, noting a clinic in Toronto has a 150 metre rule and it seems to work really well.
Zones ensure safe access
Naqvi announced in May they would create safe zones — dubbed "bubble zones" — around abortion clinics, similar to what has been done in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec.
"These zones around abortion clinics will ensure that women across Ontario have safe access to healthcare services, and that their privacy and dignity are protected when doing so," Naqvi said at the time.
Naqvi did not give any details on what could be in the bill, but did say any new laws would need to stand up in court if protesters said their rights were being trampled on.
"We [have to ensure] that we protect the right to free speech," they said.
Attorney General Yasir Naqvi said in May they plan to introduce a bill that would create safe zones around abortion clinics in Ontario. (Andrew Foote/CBC) "Because we are talking about two competing rights — in our view, one is paramount, which is a woman's right to choose — we need to make sure this legislation strikes the right balance."
Stiff penalties for offenders
The letter, which was sent to Naqvi on Monday, makes a number of suggestions for the new laws.
It includes not only that the safe zone should be 150 metres, but also that it should be automatic. In other provinces, doctors offices or clinics need to apply to have a safe zone.
It should also apply to any health care providers that are involved with abortion. It suggests first time offenders should see stiff penalties of a $4,000 fine and up to a year in prison.
"Safe access to abortion is a fundamental and constitutionally-protected right for all Canadians," the letter reads.
"While people are free to demonstrate their opposition to this right, their protests should take place a safe distance from where patients are seeking healthcare."
Butcher said women who seek an abortion feel a sense of being judged or shamed by people who don't know their situation.
Mifegymiso is used for non-surgical abortions up to seven weeks into a pregnancy. (CBC) "It actually tends to cause them to be angry and quite frustrated that someone is judging them who doesn't know what they're going through or how they've come to this very personal decision," they said.
Could ease access to abortion pill
In 2016, Health Canada approved the use of the pill Mifegymiso for non-surgical abortions up to seven weeks.
As well, the province announced in its budget this past spring that abortion pill will be publicly funded, with Finance Minister Charles Sousa noting the government is "trying to provide women with choice, and with a safe choice."
Despite that, Mifegymiso is still hard to obtain.
"Women still have to travel to Toronto from Waterloo in order to access the medication abortion," Butcher said, adding if they can stop protesters from being right outside clinics and offices, "these family doctors ... might actually be able to get access for Waterloo region women to the abortion pill."
The Shore Centre is currently doing outreach with local doctors about the pill and they said there are a couple of doctors interested in prescribing it.
"But their number one fear is they don't want protesters outside of their medical practices," they said.
Butcher said extending the bubble zone around clinics and offices that provide abortion services will ease those fears.
Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada has been coordinating the response to the provincial government with the seven other authors of the letter.
Butcher said everyone in the group had a say in the letter and signed it together. Now, they hope the Naqvi will listen.
"The minister, they have committed to having consultations, and so we are hoping to be able to participate in one of those consultation sessions," Butcher said.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School, MIT, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have discovered a new synthetic process to construct 3D metal nanoparticles using DNA as a mold, according to a study published in Science earlier this month.
By enabling the construction of nanoparticles in user-specified shapes out of materials like silver or gold, the breakthrough offers a range of applications in solar cells, disease detection, and laser technology.
“Using DNA as a nano-foundry, you can fabricate nanomaterials, 4,000 times smaller than a tiny paper sheet, as simple as growing something in your garden,” said lead author Wei Sun, a postdoctoral scholar in the Wyss' Molecular Systems Lab.
According to the Wyss Institute press release, the particles created were as small as 25 nanometers. A sheet of paper is approximately 100,000 nanometers thick.
“A really important question that was unanswered for years was how do you manipulate matter at all on the nanoscale,” said co-author and former Crimson news editor Amy Guan '12. “[The research] is important because it shows a very elegant approach to creating the kind of shape you want.”

The process begins by using software to transfer the target shape into DNA mold design with a user-specified shape. Next, researchers use the mechanical simulation software to evaluate its mechanical properties. A gold seed is implanted within the mold and grows by absorbing a solution.
A useful analogy in understanding the process might be that of growing cube-shaped Japanese watermelons, in which watermelons are grown within a plexiglass container, according to the press release.
“Our nanocasting is based on similar consideration,” Sun said. “A nanoparticle seed is grown exclusively within the mold, which confines the nanoparticle final shape complementary to the cavity shape in the mold.”
This project has been important to Sun personally.
“I'm delighted to make the first demonstration of this strategy after years of working,” Sun wrote. “[But] we still need to keep working on this direction to merge the gap between what we have done in the lab and the requirements for future device applications.”

Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.
We're all familiar with the concept of networking, and there are some myths about this social practice that I'd like to clear up. First of all, there's an assumption that you have to be “good” at networking or it won't get you anywhere. We're often told that while it's important to know a lot of people, I agree with my wise and witty Granny Johnson, who always said, “It's not who you know, it's who knows you.”
Networking is an essential key to business success that unlocks professional doors and opens up new opportunities. But putting yourself out there doesn't come easy to everyone, and interacting with a roomful of strangers can make anyone uncomfortable.
Don't let being on the shy side stop you from reaping the rewards of connecting with people in social and professional settings. All you need to feel at ease talking with anyone is a solid strategy and a little practice. Follow these seven tips to master your mingle-ability skills.
1. Step out of your comfort zone.
Don't allow your fears to inhibit you from interacting with others. An optimistic outlook on life attracts people, so go in with the attitude you're going to have a good time meeting interesting people. To take the pressure off, focus on others and less on yourself. Topics common to everyone like travel and food are ideal conversation starters.
Don't underestimate yourself. You have more to contribute than you think. If you never make the effort, you'll cut yourself off from potential opportunities as well as deprive others of your unique gifts.

2. Choose quality instead of quantity.
Instead of spending small amounts of time with a lot of people, spend more time with a smaller number of carefully chosen people. You may find it comforting to know that the strength and longevity of your relationships depend more on the quality, and far less upon the quantity, of your connections.
3. Network before you need it.
Practice speaking and introducing yourself to strangers in low-threat situations so you'll be more comfortable interacting with people you don't know that when opportunities present themselves. Listening attentively shows respect for both the person speaking and what they have to say. Making a personal connection is the very first step towards building mutually beneficial partnerships.
4. Mind your body language.
Most of what we say is communicated not in words, but subconsciously in gestures, voice tone, posture and other aspects of how we physically hold ourselves. Stand tall, keep an open stance and look people directly in the eye. These actions go a long way toward creating meaningful connections. Practice power poses in private before networking events to get in the right frame of mind and to boost your confidence.

5. Practice remembering names.
Whenever you're introduced to someone, say their or their name in conversation. This will show you are paying attention and will make the other person feel important. If you can't remember someone's name, simply say, “It's been one of those days, please tell me your name again.”
Remembering everyone you meet is impossible, yet when you make a concerted effort to remember two or three names at each event you attend, you'll become better with practice.
6. Keep it simple.
When you are interested in others and they will become interested in you. Inquire about what matters most to people, then center your conversations around their priorities. A mutually-beneficial relationship is one based on trust, respect and goodwill. The result is a long-term quality connection in which information and resources are freely exchanged.
7. Enjoy yourself.
Nothing is more attractive than sincerity. If you're having a good time, people will pick up on your enthusiasm. Exuding positive vibes is a social and professional magnet but don't fake it. It must come from an authentic attitude. Look at networking events like a party for professionals. Focus on having fun and presenting your best self. If you win some new friends and clients in the process, that's the icing on the cake.

This past off-season, the Golden State Warriors decided to move on from a big chunk of their roster in order to sign a former MVP, Kevin Durant. They got rid of the majority of their bench and even some of the starters. One of the starters who ended up on a new team was Harrison Barnes, the four-year man out of North Carolina. They signed a four-year, $95 million offer sheet with the Dallas Mavericks as a restricted free agent. As the Warriors focused solely on signing Durant, they ultimately opted not to match the offer sheet for Barnes. With the NBA season at the halfway mark, this move has worked out well for both teams thus far.
The Rise of Harrison Barnes
During their tenure with the Warriors, Barnes was a role player. They didn't have the pressure of being a top option on the team. If they had stayed with the Warriors for their entire career, chances are they wouldn't live up to their potential. Now that Barnes is on the Mavericks, there is the pressure of being one of the top offensive options on the team. As of right now, they are probably the top option. And so far, Barnes has made the Mavericks happy and is living up to their max contract.
On the season, Barnes is currently averaging 20.6 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. To put this in perspective, the most points they averaged with the Warriors was 11.7. This improvement in scoring is very similar to C.J. McCollum's rise last season with the bigger workload. McCollum would end up winning the Most Improved Player award, for which Barnes is now in the running. This season, Barnes has four 30-point games, after having none last season. It is clear that they are taking advantage of the bigger workload and is thriving on it.
Barnes' Game
In today's NBA, the majority of teams look to focus their offense on the three-pointer. Many players have adapted their game to this, including big men. Barnes, however, does things a little differently. They get most of their points from mid-range. Head coach Rick Carlisle has moved Barnes to the power forward position, which has resulted in Barnes posting up a little more. But with the return of Dirk Nowitzki, it is possible that they will move back to small forward. Barnes usually gets the ball around the free-throw line and does their work from there. A big development in Barnes' game has been their quickness. When talking about quickness, it is more of a reference to how quick they are when making decisions. Since they are more athletic than most power forwards, they can use their first step to get by them and finish at the rim. They have also started to find a solid turnaround jumper.
The Barnes-Nowitzki Relationship
Luckily for Barnes, they have one of the greatest power forwards of all time to guide them in Nowitzki. Unfortunately, they haven't been able to play much together this season due to a nagging Achilles injury for Nowitzki. But when they have played together, the Mavericks have played their best basketball. It does wonders for both of them to not have to carry the workload on the offensive end, especially since Nowitzki is 38 years old. We have seen Nowtizki take Barnes under their wing and show them the ways of being a top option on a team. They have praised Barnes the entire time and really feels that the sky is the limit for him.
Looking Forward
While Barnes has been a bright spot for the Mavericks this season, they are a mere 14-27. Fortunately, they are only three games out of the eighth seed in the Western Conference and have won three games in a row. But even if they don't make the playoffs, the front office knows that they have something good going with Barnes. They will only grow as a player and will look to lead the Mavericks for years to come.

FDA approves first blood test to detect gene mutation associated with non-small cell lung cancer
June 1, 2016 -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2, a blood-based companion diagnostic for the cancer drug Tarceva (erlotinib). This is the first FDA-approved, blood-based genetic test that can detect epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Such mutations are present in approximately 10-20 percent of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women in the U.S. and, though more common in men, the number of deaths from lung cancer in women is increasing. According to the National Cancer Institute, an estimated 221,200 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 158,040 will die from the disease this year. NSCLC is the most common type of lung cancer. NSCLC tumors may shed tumor DNA into a patient's blood, making it possible to detect specific mutations in blood samples. Testing for tumor DNA using a blood sample is also called a “liquid biopsy.”
“Approvals of liquid biopsy tests make it possible to deliver highly individualized health care for patients,” said Alberto Gutierrez, Ph.D., director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “Liquid biopsies also have the potential to allow physicians to identify patients whose tumors have specific mutations in the least invasive way possible.”
With the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2, the presence of specific NSCLC mutations [exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations] detected in patients' blood samples aids in selecting those who may benefit from treatment with Tarceva. However, if such mutations are not detected in the blood, then a tumor biopsy should be performed to determine if the NSCLC mutations are present. Insofar as the test provides positive results, it may benefit patients who may be too ill or are otherwise unable to provide a tumor specimen for EGFR testing.
The efficacy of the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 using blood samples was determined by using the test to identify the EGFR mutation status in patients enrolled into a clinical trial whose tumor biopsies were previously confirmed positive for the EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations as determined by the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v1.
The FDA approved Tarceva in 2004 to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen, and in 2013, the FDA approved it for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors having EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R substitution mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. The most common side effects of Tarceva are rash, diarrhea, anorexia, fatigue, difficulty breathing (dyspnea), cough, nausea and vomiting. Tarceva is not recommended for use in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy and the drug has not been evaluated as first-line treatment in patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations other than exon 19 deletions or L858R substitution mutations.
The cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 is manufactured by Roche Molecular Systems in Pleasanton, California. Tarceva is manufactured by Astellas Pharma Technologies, Inc. of Norman, Oklahoma and distributed by Genentech Inc., of South San Francisco, California.

TLDEF Condemns Two New Anti-Transgender Bills in Texas
March 13, 2015 - TLDEF strongly denounces new proposed legislation in Texas that singles out transgender people for harsh discrimination. Introduced by Republican State Representative Gilbert Peña on March 10, House Bills 2801 and 2802 come on the heels of a string of bills targeting transgender people, including a prior bill in Texas, and similar ones in Kentucky, Florida and Minnesota.
House Bill 2801 would require schools to adopt policies prohibiting transgender students from using bathrooms and locker rooms consistent with who they are as boys and girls. It would also make schools liable for a minimum of $2,000 in damages that schools would have to pay to students who complain that they encountered a transgender student in a prohibited bathroom.
House Bill 2802 would make it a class B misdemeanor for transgender people to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match who they are as men and women. Violators would be punished by up to 180 days in jail, a fine of up to $2,000, or both. It would also give those who simply encounter transgender people in prohibited restrooms the ability to sue them for punitive damages of $2,000 and unlimited additional damages “for mental anguish.”
These bills come just weeks after Texas Republican State Representative Debbie Riddle introduced House Bill 1748 that would make it a crime for any transgender person over 12 to use a bathroom that matches their true self. That bill would punish transgender people with jail time of up to one year and fines of up to $4,000 for its violation. HB 1748 would also make it a felony for anyone who runs a public place like a restaurant to allow transgender people access to bathrooms they are prohibited from using under the terms of the bill. The violator could be punished by up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
Statement from TLDEF Executive Director Michael Silverman
“These bills constitute an intolerable assault on the basic rights of transgender people. By threatening schools with punishment of at least $2,000 every time a transgender student is encountered in a bathroom, HB 2801 upends the basic relationship of teacher and student. Instead of ensuring that all Texas students can participate in school equally, Texas teachers would have to police their transgender students or stand by as their schools were penalized. The bill would make transgender students, who already face immense challenges, targets for further bullying, harassment and persecution. This is an attack on the health and well-being of vulnerable transgender youth who deserve the same chance to be safe and happy in their school environments as everyone else.
“HB 2802, which would criminalize transgender people for using bathrooms and locker rooms that match their true selves, is similarly unacceptable. It turns neighbor against neighbor by allowing anyone who encounters a transgender person in a prohibited bathroom to sue them. It follows the February 20 introduction of HB 1748, which also threatens transgender people with criminal prosecution. That bill additionally targets anyone who operates a bathroom open to the public. It threatens those bathroom providers with felony charges for allowing a transgender person to use a prohibited bathroom.
“These bills represent a dangerous escalation in efforts to gut non-discrimination ordinances in local areas that protect transgender people. They threaten basic freedoms and tear at the fabric of civil society. Lawmakers behind these bills claim that they are looking out for public safety. But they are creating unsafe conditions by declaring open season on transgender people in Texas. Targeting people this way is discriminatory, wrong, and cannot be tolerated. We hope a majority of fair-minded Texas legislators will recognize the harm that all of these bills will cause and soundly defeat them.”
U.S. SOUNDS A WARNING : U.S. Must 'Stop the Brutal Atrocities' in Haiti, Clinton Says
Now the United States must protect our interests, to stop the brutal atrocities that threaten tens of thousands of Haitians, to secure our borders, and to preserve stability and promote democracy in our hemisphere, and to uphold the reliability of the commitments we make and the commitments others make to us.
Haiti's dictators, led by (Lt.) Gen. Raoul Cedras, control the most violent regime in our hemisphere. For three years, they have rejected every peaceful solution that the international community has proposed. They have broken an agreement that they made to give up power. They have brutalized their people and destroyed their economy. And for three years, we and other nations have worked exhaustively to find a diplomatic solution, only to have the dictators reject each one.
My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about why the United States is leading the international effort to restore democratic government in Haiti.
Earlier today, I ordered Secretary of Defense (William J.) Perry to call up the military reserve personnel necessary to support United States troops in any action we might undertake in Haiti. I have also ordered two aircraft carriers--the USS Eisenhower and the USS America--into the region. I issued these orders after giving full consideration to what is at stake.
The message of the United States to the Haitian dictators is clear: Your time is up. Leave now, or we will force you from power.
I want the American people to understand the background of the situation in Haiti, how what has happened there affects our national security interests and why I believe we must act now.
Nearly 200 years ago, the Haitian people rose up out of slavery and declared their independence. Unfortunately, the promise of liberty was quickly snuffed out, and ever since, Haiti has known more suffering and repression than freedom. In our time, as democracy has spread throughout our hemisphere, Haiti has been left behind.
Then, just four years ago, the Haitian people held the first free and fair elections since their independence. They elected a parliament and a new president--Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a Catholic priest who received almost 70% of the vote.
But eight months later, Haitian dreams of democracy became a nightmare of bloodshed. Gen. Raoul Cedras led a military coup that overthrew President Aristide, the man who had appointed Cedras to lead the army.
Resisters were beaten and murdered. The dictators launched a horrible intimidation campaign of rape, torture and mutilation. People starved, children died, thousands of Haitians fled their country, heading to the United States across dangerous seas.
At that time, President (George) Bush declared the situation posed, and I quote, "an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."
Cedras and their armed thugs have conducted a reign of terror, executing children, raping women, killing priests. As the dictators have grown more desperate, the atrocities have grown ever more brutal.
Recent news reports have documented the slaying of Haitian orphans by the nation's deadly police thugs. The dictators are said to suspect the children of harboring sympathy toward President Aristide, for no other reason than they ran an orphanage in their days as a parish priest. The children fled the orphanages for the streets, now they can't even sleep there because they are so afraid.
SNOOPERS' CHARTER VERSION 2.0, otherwise known as the Investigatory Powers Bill, could allow police to view the web browsing history of everyone in Britain.
A report at The Times (paywalled) said that senior police officials have lobbied the government to force telecoms companies to retain data for 12 months that would reveal specific web addresses visited by customers.
This could mean that, under the Investigatory Powers Bill that is expected to be introduced by home secretary Theresa May next week, ISPs will be required to retain customers' web browsing histories for a year.
Access to this data would then be granted to police, the National Crime Agency, intelligence agencies and HM Revenue and Customs, according to the report. However, approval from a judge would be required to view the content of websites, emails and social media messages.
Richard Berry, National Police Chiefs Council spokesperson for data communication, told The Times that forces are not asking for anything beyond their current powers covering telephone conversations.
"We want to police by consent, and we want to ensure that privacy safeguards are in place. But we need to balance this with the needs of the vulnerable and the victims," they said.
"We essentially need the 'who, where, when and what' of any communication: who initiated it, where they were and when it happened. And a little bit of the 'what'. Were they on Facebook, or a banking site, or an illegal child abuse image-sharing website?
"Five years ago [a suspect] could have physically walked into a bank and carried out a transaction. We could have put a surveillance team on that. But now, most of it is done online. We just want to know about the visit."
May is on the same wavelength as Berry, and has long made their feelings known when it comes to privacy.
"I've said many times before that it is not possible to debate the balance between privacy and security, including the rights and wrongs of intrusive powers, and the oversight arrangements that govern them, without considering the threats that we face as a country," they told MPs recently.
MP David Davis said in opposition to the plans that it is "extraordinary” for police to ask for such powers.
"They are overreaching and there is no proven need to retain such data for a year,” they said. µ

In a New York magazine article published Saturday, Conway said that rather than telling Trump to stop tweeting, they try to promote positivity.
“I would say, ‘Here are a couple of cool things we should tweet today.' It's like saying to someone, ‘How about having two brownies and not six?'" Conway told New York magazine.
Conway said they have tried to appeal to Trump's business sense to get them to shift their campaign — they said they related Trump's need to court women voters with finding new "customers."
In the story, other current and former Trump advisers describe the GOP nominee's hard-to-handle character. As one confidant said: "You have to trick them into doing what you want.”
Interviews paint a picture of Trump as free-wheeling even in the face of campaign crises. When their campaign took a hit for their public feud with the parents of a fallen Muslim U.S. soldier, Trump reportedly didn't know what the term "Gold Star family" meant and viewed the Khans as just another enemy to combat.
Scene: Meredith's office. Them office door is open.
– Rob, can you please come into my office for a second? I need to talk to you.
– Sure, I'll be there in 5 minutes, what's it about?
– I just have a question for you.
– Sure thing.
5 minutes later, in Meredith's office. The office door is closed.
– Ok, sit down, how long have we been business partners, Rob?
– Well, it's been 20 years, but you didn't call me here to talk about this, right?
– Well, the last few weeks have been a little difficult. I mean, all last week you have been late into the office, on three days you did not get here before noon, and once you left at 2. You know, this can have a negative effect on business.
– You're right Meredith, I am so sorry, but we have already discussed this. I know, that woman I just met is really hot, you know I have been seeing them every night for the last month. We have incredible sex, it's just amazing. And yes, sometimes we stay in bed in the morning having great sex, and I forget about my responsibilities here in the office. I get up to take a shower, and they follow me and we have sex again in the bathtub. It is really hard to get away from them But we have talked about it, I thought you understood.
– Sure Rob, we discussed it, you are right. I understand you are totally taken by this relationship, I know it is just physical, you told me that. (pause) But look at this!
– Wait, where did you find it?
– In your desk's drawer.
– Wait, I can explain.
– What can you explain, Rob? (raising their voice)
– It's not how it looks.
– No, really? Isn't this the sales prospect flyer from our competitor?
– Yes, …, but, …
– I hired a private eye to follow you Rob. I know everything, stop lying. You are not seeing a lover, you have a second job! That is why you are always late! That is why you are always tired. (getting emotional) What is it Robbing? Is their coffee better? Do they have better health benefits? Is their corporate garage larger so you can have fun getting in and out with your new car? Isn't our garage good enough for you? What is it, is it because to save money we have turned down heating the garage? Is getting in and out a warm garage more fun? Is that what it is? What is it, Rob, tell me (now shouting)!
– I, …, (hesitating), is not the coffee. Meredith, it is not what you think, please?
– No? Of course, what then? And have you thought about our stock-holders, Rob? We went public 17 years ago, did you think about our oldest share-holders? They are close to making their first million, and now what? How are you going to explain this to them? What are you going to tell them, Rob?
– Meredith, nothing really happened.
– I have the pictures, Rob. Look, you are shaking hands with their CEO, how are you going to explain this? You had meetings with them at 10AM! Two weeks ago you told me you were taking a weekend off paid with our company's money to have an erotic sexy weekend with your lover, instead you were working the whole weekend! (yelling) Are you still lying? I know everything Rob. Go out, leave me alone, please.
– Ok, let's talk later, Meredith, pleaaase (imploring)
– Go Rob, go away! (now crying)
Rob leaves, leaving Meredith's office's door open.

- Authorities say a woman was shot while driving in the northbound lanes on State Route 51.
This all happened at approximately 7:20 p.m. between McDowell and Thomas on Wednesday. Police tell us the woman was traveling from the westbound lanes on Interstate 10 and transferring to the 51 northbound when they called 9-1-1 to report a truck following them that was driving erratically.
"One of those calls was from an adult woman who stated that the truck was actually chasing them While they were on the phone with 9-1-1, the dispatcher heard about three gunshots and the call was ended. DPS officers and Phoenix officers responded to the scene and located an adult woman who had crashed their car in the center divider along the HOV lane in between McDowell Road and Thomas Road. They were taken to a local hospital in critical condition and unfortunately has since died from their injuries," said Sgt. Jonathan Howard.
Police continue to search for a white work-type truck with ladder racks and a toolbox on it. They say from descriptions the woman was able to give them, there were three Hispanic males in the truck.
Authorities believe that truck may have exited the 51 near Thomas Road.
"Officers found four other vehicles that were involved in minor collisions related to the shooting. Two occupants of those vehicles were taken to local hospitals with minor injuries," stated Howard.
Police have identified the victim as 49-year-old Dinya Farmer.
The northbound lanes of State Route 51 from the I-10 Mini-Stack to Thomas Road were reopened early Thursday morning.
Anyone with information regarding this incident is urged to call the Phoenix Police Department at -602-262-6151 or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS.

The Quiverfull/Patriarchy culture produces plenty of “how-to” books, such as Fascinating Womanhood, and Created to Be Their Help Meet, to show women how to be the most “godly” wives and mothers they can be. Since I practically absorbed a ton of these types of books through my skin for the first eight years of our marriage, I noticed one thing they all had in common: they tell us how how to talk to our husbands with “respect,” “honor,” and “deference to their authority.” We learned how to use encouragement, childlike phrases, praise, focusing on the positives, and carefully worded requests to communicate within our marriages.
For example, in the book Fascinating Womanhood , a man is about to make a disastrous financial decision, where they could lose everything. The author encourages the wife to say, “It sounds like a good idea, and I can see why you're excited about it, but for some reason, deep inside, I just don't feel right about it.” It's not that they don't see specific reasons for the financial danger—it's that saying those reasons outright could hurt what the author calls their “Sensitive Masculine Pride.”
In Created to Be Their Help Meet , Debi Pearl states: “It is important for a woman to understand that [a wife] must be feminine (devoid of dominance and control) in order for their man to view them as their exact counterpart, and thus willingly respond to them protectively, with love and gentleness. A woman who criticizes their husband… is expressing dishonor. When the relationship is properly balanced, a wife can make an appeal at the right time and in the right manner, and it need not be a challenge to their authority.” (emphasis mine)
These books promise that if you do speak to them just the right way, they will listen to you.
And if they don't listen to you, it's the outcome God wanted anyway.
The good news is that this method of communication has already been tested extensively in another context—commercial airlines—and the results were startling: they caused planes to crash.
Malcom Gladwell, in their book Outliers, tells us of “The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes.” Apparently, when investigators analyzed the events leading up to many crashes, using the black box recorders, they found a common thread. More than engine failure, bad weather, pilot exhaustion, or drug use, the most common cause of a plane crash was what the author called “Mitigated Speech” between the Captain and the rest of the flight crew. For example :
“In the 1982 Air Florida crash outside Washington, DC, the first officer tried three times to tell the captain that the plane had a dangerous amount of ice on its wings.
FIRST OFFICER:
Look how the ice is just hanging on his, ah, back, back there, see that?
[Later]
FIRST OFFICER:
See all those icicles on the back there and everything?
[Right before take-off]
FIRST OFFICER:
Let's check those [wing] tops again, since we've been setting here awhile.
The captain says, “I think we get to go here in a minute.”
They don't de-ice the wings.
The only direct statement this co-pilot made to the captain was as they were crashing into the Potomac River: “Larry, we're going down, Larry.”
In an analysis of a similar crash, the investigators report was heartbreaking:
“The copilot was right. But they died because… when the copilot asked questions, their implied suggestions were very weak. The captain's reply was to ignore them totally. Perhaps the copilot did not want to appear rebellious, questioning the judgment of the captain, or they did not want to play the fool because they knew that the pilot had a great deal of experience flying in that area. The copilot should have advocated for their own opinions in a stronger way…” (emphasis mine)
Even worse, when a pilot and flight crew was steeped in a culture that valued honor and hierarchy, such as Korea, then the odds of the plane crashing were astronomically higher. In the case of Korean Air, the planes were seventeen times more likely to crash than a comperable American airline.
Why?
As Gladwell says, “Among Korean Air flight crews, the expectation on layovers used to be that the junior officers would attend to the captain to the point of making them dinner or purchasing them gifts. As one former Korean Air pilot puts it, the sensibility in many of the airline's cockpits was that ‘the captain is in charge and does what they want, when they like, how they like, and everyone else sits quietly and does nothing.'”
And later: “At a [Korean] dinner table, a lower-ranking person must wait until a higher-ranking person sits down and starts eating, while the reverse does not hold true… in greeting a social superior (though not an inferior) a Korean must bow… All social behavior and actions are conducted in the order of seniority or ranking; as the saying goes, chanmul to wi alay ka issta, there is order even to drink cold water.”
Sound familiar?
In the realm of the Christian Patriarchy Movement, if a wife disagrees with their husband, or communicates too forcefully, she's fundamentally dishonoring him. Is it any wonder that marriages, finances, careers, children, and churches crash and burn? No one can tell the Pilot when danger is approaching.
And if the plane crashes…oh well, it must have been God's will.
There is no scriptural support for this. By contrast, Proverbs 31:11 & 12 says:
11 Them husbands can trust her,
and they will greatly enrich their life.
12 They bring them good, not harm,
all the days of their life.
If a husband trusts their wife, then a wife telling them the truth without mitigated speech should be viewed as a blessing, not an unfeminine quality that should be squashed.
Also, in Isaiah 33:
“3 When the watchman sees the enemy coming, they sound the alarm to warn the people. 4 Then if those who hear the alarm refuse to take action, it is their own fault if they die…..6 But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn't sound the alarm to warn the people, they are responsible for their captivity. They will die in their sins, but I will hold the watchman responsible for their deaths.'” (emphasis mine)
Could you imagine the watchman saying, “Um, I don't want to bother you, and I know you're normally prepared, but I saw something that might have been a dust cloud kicked up by an army. If you get a chance, could you come double-check for me?”
My marriage has been crippled and broken several times by my own use of mitigated speech, and by the faulty, unscriptural belief that, “Well, if they don't respond, it must have been God's will.” I've learned that my husband simply can't read my mind to discern when something is deathly serious, and when something is just a passing concern. I have to speak assertively, passionately, and clearly in order to communicate things like:
“What you said hurt our daughter, and was unfair.”
“We can't afford that, and do the other things you wanted to do.”
“I'm sick, and I need help.”
According to Gladwell, what turned Korea Air around was a cultural shift that demanded the Pilot and First-Officer see each other as equals. They had to address each other by first name instead of rank, speak English-only at the airline, and work hard to overcome their ingrained cultural belief that the Pilot was always right. Every single day, they had to work to change destructive habits that had been with them since birth.
Six years later, Korea Air received an award for the most improved safety of any airline.
We can change our own habits too, if we are willing to recognize that the culture we came from is not Biblical, is not helping us reach the goal of a good marriage, and is actually harming us.

Modi on Wednesday morning returned home +

PM @narendramodi arrives Delhi after successful visit to Portugal, USA and Netherlands,being welcomed by External A… https://t.co/ozHnn3hS0M — PIB India (@PIB_India) 1498617612000
NEW DELHI: When PM Modi lands back in Delhi on Wednesday, they would have completed perhaps the, including the United States, by an Indian prime minister.In the trip totalling a little more than 95 hours, Modi would have spent more than a third of their time — 33 hours to be precise — flying in their Air India Boeing. In the rest of the time at their disposal, they would have attended to 33 back-to-back engagements and meetings in the US, Portugal and the Netherlands, officials privy to the PM's detailed itinerary told ET.The PM would have spent two of the four nights during the trip flying, without staying a night in either Portugal or the Netherlands.This would be in keeping with the rule of sorts during their overseas trips nowadays, as per which they do not spend a night in a country if there is no engagement scheduled for the next day there but rather uses the night to fly to the next destination.Modi followed this during the trip while flying from Lisbon to Washington DC, thereon to Hague and also on the way back home.The PM first flew 10 hours to Lisbon, leaving at 7 am on June 24 from Delhi. They did not check into a hotel there during the day, choosing to have a briefing in the VVIP lounge of the Lisbon Airport on landing and leaving straight for Portugal's foreign ministry from there.After meetings and a working lunch there, they visited the Champalimaud Foundation, held an interaction with the Indian community and left straight for the Lisbon Airport to fly out at 6 pm local time for Washington DC.The nearly eight-hour flight took them to Washington when it would have been about 4 am in India. The nearly 50-member Indian team then checked into the Willard Continental Hotel.The PM had 17 engagements in the US over the next two days, including the meeting with American CEOs and engagements at the White House. They did not spend a second night in Washington DC, choosing to emplane for the Netherlands around 9 pm local time on Monday.There too, they had about seven engagements, including an address to the Indian community in the evening, before they departed straight for the airport to emplane for Delhi at 7 pm Dutch time.Modi is scheduled to land in Delhi at 6:20 am on Wednesday, on what is expected to be a working day, before they head for their home state Gujarat the next day.

It's an eccentric tale with an even more arresting title.
The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out of a Window and Disappeared, by author Jonas Jonasson, sold six million copies and has been translated into 38 languages since it was originally published in their native Sweden in 2009.
Now it's hoped the story will find new fans after being made into one of Scandinavia's biggest-budget films.
"I think of it as a road movie," explains Felix Herngren, the director.
"You have the story of a man called Allan Karlsson, who ends up in a nursing home as they turn one hundred years old. But he's bored, and on the day of their party, just climbs out of the window and goes on an extraordinary adventure, involving stolen suitcases of cash, criminals, and elephants - the latter not something you see that often in the Swedish countryside.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Director Felix Herngren and star Robert Gustafsson spoke to the BBC's Emma Jones
"It turns out Allan has had an extraordinary life, as he's worked in explosives since they were a teenager, and they have met Franco, Stalin, Truman, Reagan - all these names of the 20th century - who also appear in the film.
"In many ways, there's an element of Forrest Gump about them - a simple man to whom extraordinary things happen - so much so, that when Jonas saw that film in 1994, they were very depressed, as he'd already had the idea for the book.
"But Allan Karlsson is their own man - he's inquisitive and curious about life and that's probably why he's managed to reach their century."
The novel sold more than a million copies in Sweden alone, but it was the global success, according to Herngren, that gave the film its impetus - although the budget is still tiny by Hollywood standards, at under £6m.
The director is well-known in Scandinavia for their films and TV commercials, while the actor who plays Allan Karlsson, 50-year-old Robert Gustafsson, has regularly been voted 'Sweden's Funniest Man'.
Nevertheless, Herngren says it was a project with a lot of pressure.
"We love that the book is so loved abroad, and we got more money to make the movie because of its popularity, but it's a big responsibility to capture the humour and the tone.
Image copyright Film company Image caption David Shackleton (r) stars as Albert Einstein's fictional brother, the dim-witted Herbert
Jonas Jonasson is in their fifties now, but they used to work in TV, so they left me alone. They said, 'you do what you want - but don't disappoint me'. They watched the film three times in one day and I think they like it."
Because of the phenomenal success of stories like The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Wallander and The Killing, the countries that make up Scandinavia - Sweden, Norway and Denmark- have a reputation for excelling at crime noir. Scandi-crime is part of popular vocabulary. But how will Scandi-comedy play out on screen - even with Sweden's Funniest Man at the helm?
"Swedish humour is low-key," explains Robert Gustafsson.
"I think there is a lot in common with the British," they add. "We don't like over-acting, like Jim Carrey, but we're quite physical. We love Monty Python and Ricky Gervais. Monty Python are like gods here.
"We like good acting, and we watch a lot of British drama. So we really feel a connection with your humour, and I think certainly Britain will appreciate this film, even in its original Swedish.
"Perhaps this is a good counter-move to all our crime stories," adds Herngren. " A lot of people do die in this film, rest assured, but they die in very funny ways."
Image copyright Film company Image caption Among the cast members is a stolen circus elephant called Sonja
Gustafsson says they had to confront their own fears about ageing when they wore a prosthetic mask for the entire film to give the impression they were a centenarian. It was, they confess, "not pleasant to see myself in the mirror - but then while I was in character, I got, as you say, hit on, by a lady who had no idea it wasn't real. So there is plenty to look forward to, even at that age!"
And that, Herngren believes, is the secret to the success of The 100 Year Old Man: it's a rare tale of joy in old age.
"We in Sweden also have the feeling that getting older is a sad part of life, where you can end up in a home alone, with no one visiting you.
"I guess it's nice to see that a man walks out of their own birthday party to go and explore the world again and make new friends. He's still curious about life and doesn't judge anyone.
"In fact Alan Karlsson is doing what most of us should learn to do. Do not worry about your future, use your gut instinct and do not fret about yesterday's troubles. That is why they speak to us."
The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed Out of a Window and Disappeared is released in the UK on Friday 4 July.

SEN. Dianne Feinstein has resigned from the Military Construction Appropriations subcommittee. As previously and extensively reviewed in these pages, Feinstein was chairperson and ranking member of MILCON for six years, during which time they had a conflict of interest due to their husband Richard C. Blum's ownership of two major defense contractors, who were awarded billions of dollars for military construction projects approved by Feinstein.
As MILCON leader, Feinstein relished the details of military construction, even micromanaging one project at the level of its sewer design. They regularly took junkets to military bases around the world to inspect construction projects, some of which were contracted to their husband's companies, Perini Corp. and URS Corp.
Perhaps they resigned from MILCON because they could not take the heat generated by Metro's expose of their ethics (which was partially funded by the Investigative Fund of the Nation Institute). Or was their work on the subcommittee finished because Blum divested ownership of their military construction and advanced weapons manufacturing firms in late 2005?
The MILCON subcommittee is not only in charge of supervising military construction, it also oversees "quality of life" issues for veterans, which includes building housing for military families and operating hospitals and clinics for wounded soldiers. Perhaps Feinstein is trying to disassociate themselves from MILCON's incredible failure to provide decent medical care for wounded soldiers.
Two years ago, before the Washington Post became belatedly involved, the online magazine Salon.com exposed the horrors of deficient medical care for Iraq war veterans. While leading MILCON, Feinstein had ample warning of the medical-care meltdown. But they were not proactive on veteran's affairs.
Feinstein abandoned MILCON as their ethical problems were surfacing in the media, and as it was becoming clear that their subcommittee left grievously wounded veterans to rot while their family was profiting from the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. It turns out that Blum also holds large investments in companies that were selling medical equipment and supplies and real estate leases—often without the benefit of competitive bidding—to the Department of Veterans Affairs, even as the system of medical care for veterans collapsed on their wife's watch.
As of December 2006, according to SEC filings and www.fedspending.org, three corporations in which Blum's financial entities own a total of $1 billion in stock won considerable favor from the budgets of the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs:
Boston Scientific Corporation: $17.8 million for medical equipment and supplies; 85 percent of contracts awarded without benefit of competition.
Kinetic Concepts Inc.: $12 million, medical equipment and supplies; 28 percent noncompetitively awarded.
CB Richard Ellis: The Blum-controlled international real estate firm holds congressionally funded contracts to lease office space to the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also is involved in redeveloping military bases turned over to the private sector.
You would think that, considering all the money Feinstein's family has pocketed by waging global warfare while ignoring the plight of wounded American soldiers, they would show a smidgeon of shame and resign from the entire Senate, not just a subcommittee. Conversely, you'd think they might stick around MILCON to try and fix the medical-care disaster they helped to engineer for the vets who were suckered into fighting them and Bush's panoply of unjust wars.

One of the biggest challenges for Respawn Entertainment is creating a story-driven experience in a multiplayer-only game like Titanfall. So how can the studio captivate its audiences who are looking for more in-depth details on the setting and characters of it's upcoming shooter?
Speaking with Games, senior map designer Mohammad Alavi answered this question, saying that the team is “telling a story through a first-person perspective in ways that are both traditional to single player campaigns and very new for multiplayer… at least for First-Person Shooters.”
“Without going into too much boring detail about client/server logistics, asynchronous scripting, and other buzzwords, I can tell you that from the end user experience it feels both familiar and groundbreaking at the same time,” they said.
They go on to state that each “multiplayer level has an objective that is presented in a cinematic way with twists and turns that occur as you play. From picture in picture updates from NPCs, events that unfold in-game, to the AI soldiers reacting on the ground, the narrative unfolds naturally and ties in seamlessly with the gameplay. Along with the main story arch, major and minor characters react and acknowledge your direct actions creating a personal experience crafted just for you set in a larger framework. In multiplayer lobbies we continue the narrative to help bridge the gaps between levels. You'll be changing your loadouts and viewing unlocks while listening to mission briefings that drive the plot along.”
“I know it all sounds like ‘back of the box' bullet points, but we've gone to great lengths to present a character driven cinematic experience, and immerse you in a living, breathing world, without ever taking control away from the player. It feels like singleplayer, but it also feels like multiplayer” describes Alavi. “There's no other way to describe it. Even after working on the game for years now, I still have moments when I jump out of the drop-ship with a squad of my real life friends, look up at what's unfolding before my eyes and literally say out loud, ‘I can't believe this is multiplayer'.”
What are your thoughts? Are you excited that Respawn has taken a leap of faith to not include a single player campaign in Titanfall, but a multiplayer campaign instead?
China plans the second launch of its new heavy-lift Long March 5 rocket tomorrow, July 2. It will place the Shijian-18 (SJ-18) communications satellite into geostationary orbit, China's heaviest satellite to date. China describes the launch as a final test before the rocket is used to send a robotic sample return mission to the Moon in November.
Long March 5 is one of a new fleet of launch vehicles developed by China that use environmentally friendly propellants — liquid oxygen (LOX)/kerosene instead of hydrazine. China's largest rocket, it can place 25 metric tons (MT) into low Earth orbit (LEO) or 14 MT into geostationary orbit (GEO). Launches take place from the new Wenchang Satellite Launch Center on Hainan Island.
The first launch in November 2016 placed SJ-17, also an experimental communications satellite, into GEO.
SJ-18 is a 7 MT satellite that will test a new satellite platform, Dongfanghong-5 (DFH-5), developed by the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) according to Andrew Jones at gbtimes.com. They add that the throughput for SJ-18 is 70 Gbps, overshadowing the 20 Gpbs of the SJ-13 experimental high throughout satellite launched earlier this year. SJ-13 and SJ-18 both are testing space-based laser communications as well, they report.
Jones tweeted that tomorrow's launch is expected at approximately 11:20 GMT (7:20 am ET).

China has expansive plans for Long March 5 that include launching robotic missions to the Moon and Mars as well as three 20 MT modules that will be joined together in LEO to form a larger space station than the 8.6 MT space stations (Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2) China has launched so far.
The November lunar mission is Chang'e-5, the long awaited Chinese mission to robotically return samples of the Moon to Earth. China hopes to return 2 kilograms of samples.
The Soviet Union conducted three successful robotic lunar sample return missions (Luna 16, Luna 20 and Luna 24) from 1970-1976, returning a total of 326 grams of lunar material. Six U.S. Apollo crews brought back 382 kilograms of lunar samples between 1969 and 1972.
China conducted a successful test flight in 2014 in preparation for Chang'e-5 to demonstrate reentry and landing from lunar distance. China already has launched two lunar orbiters (Chang'e-1 and -2) and a lander/rover (Chang'e-3/Yutu). Chang'e is China's mythical goddess of the Moon. Yutu is their companion Jade Rabbit.
Robert Gates, the U.S. Secretary of Defense from 2006 to 2011, said Thursday that they would not be comfortable if Donald Trump had control over the launch codes for nuclear weapons.
Gates sounded off on the presumptive Republican presidential candidate during a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric in New York.
“Would you feel comfortable with their proverbial finger on the nuclear button?” Couric asked.
Gates, who also served as director of the CIA in the early ‘90s, took a deep breath before answering:
“Right now? No. But the question is do they moderate their views on national security issues going forward? Do they begin to have some more informed views about the complexities of some of these issues, some of the challenges that we face? And who do they choose as their advisors? If all of those things turned out in a positive way, then my concerns would be significantly reduced.”
They said the right temperament is perhaps the most important quality for a president. When pressed, they declined to comment on whether Trump or likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton would be a better choice based on this criterion.

As secretary of defense, Gates served Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, under whom they also worked closely with Clinton when they were secretary of state. They described Clinton as “tough-minded” but said their views started to diverge in spring of 2011, when they opposed and they supported the U.S. intervening in Libya.
“The irony is that the Obama administration made the same mistake in intervening in Libya that the Bush administration made in intervening in Iraq,” they said. “And that was the failure to have a plan for what happens after the intervention, after regime change and to implement that plan.”
They also pointed to Clinton's email scandal as an example of what they consider their questionable judgment. Clinton exclusively used a private email server for their State Department work. In contrast, Gates said they never used any email for official business when they were director of the CIA or secretary of defense.
With barely a day to spare, a southern Minnesota woman showed up at the state's lottery headquarters in Roseville and claimed their $50,000 prize. Another person in the same situation, however, is out of luck.
Debra Newman of Austin had the good fortune to arrive on Thursday to cash in the Powerball ticket, which they bought on Jan. 13, 2016. Its value would have plummeted to $0 if they had arrived after 5 p.m. on Friday the 13th.
Of the 12 $50,000 winning tickets sold in Minnesota for that drawing in the multistate game, one did expire. It was bought in Jackson at the SuperAmerica at 514 3rd St. The unclaimed money goes into the state's general fund.
Newman said that they don't play the lottery often and bought the ticket only at the urging of co-workers when the jackpot had reached $1.5 billion a year ago.
Newman said they hadn't claimed the prize earlier because "it was a rough year, and I thought for sure [the deadline to claim] was February. I heard on the news that a ticket purchased in Austin was going to expire and I thought, 'Wait a minute, that's me.' "
The Kwik Trip at 1201 W. Oakland Av. in Austin sold Newman the winning ticket, which matched four of the five numbers drawn plus the Powerball.

Grasshopper's latest test reaches 24 stories high
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted: March 11, 2013
SpaceX's reusable rocket testbed completed another brief hop at a Texas test facility last week, rising 24 stories into the air and landing on its launch pad. The test Thursday demonstrated a guidance and landing algorithm to be used by SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, according to Elon Musk, the company's founder and CEO.

SpaceX is testing the Grasshopper vehicle to help create a reusable rocket, aiming to reduce the cost of launches and make space transportation more affordable. "Reusability is extremely important if you think it's important that humanity extend beyond Earth and become a multi-planet species," Musk said Saturday in a keynote session at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas. The 106-foot-tall Grasshopper vehicle, powered by a single Merlin 1D rocket engine, lifted off and reached an altitude of 262.8 feet. The 34-second flight ended with a pinpoint landing back where the rocket took off. The Grasshopper settled back on the launch pad using the Merlin engine's thrust to steer and control the speed of its descent. Thursday's flight was the fourth in a series of Grasshopper test flights, which began in September with a brief hop that reached about 8 feet off the ground. "Grasshopper touched down with its most accurate precision thus far on the centermost part of the launch pad," SpaceX said in a statement. "At touchdown, the thrust to weight ratio of the vehicle was greater than one, proving a key landing algorithm for Falcon 9." Grasshopper testing occurs at SpaceX's rocket development facility in McGregor, Texas, located about midway between Dallas and Austin. The Grasshopper vehicle is a modified Falcon 9 rocket first stage with four steel and aluminum landing legs with hydraulic dampers and a steel support structure.

Musk said making a completely reusable rocket would create a hundredfold reduction in the cost of spaceflight. "That's been the goal since the beginning of the company," Musk said. "So far, I haven't been very successful in that regard. I think we kind of have a handle on it. We've got a design that, in the simulations and in the [computer] and so forth, it closes. It should work. If we can build that thing, it should work. SpaceX's concept calls for the company's Falcon 9 rocket to lift off and drop its first stage a few minutes into flight. The nine-engine first stage would guide itself back to the launch site with leftover propellant in its fuel tanks, flying from the upper atmosphere to a vertical landing for reuse instead of falling into the ocean. Engineers need more tests to prove the reusability technology before employing the concept on a real rocket launch. "With each successive test, we want to higher and farther and improve the technology to the point where we'll be doing transitions all the way to hypersonic and back, hopefully later this year," Musk said.
Researchers at Temple University announced this week that they were successfully able to remove HIV from two mice by snipping the infection's code from their DNA.
The work, done in conjunction with the University of Pittsburgh, is inspiring new hope for a cure for HIV.
Philly.com reports that the recent success is the latest development in years of research into gene editing technology. While previous efforts were successful in editing the infection's DNA in lab dishes, this is the first time the code has been edited in a mouse. The mice represented a new and a chronic infection.
The next step for researchers is testing the technology in monkeys, whose HIV infections more closely resembles that of humans.
Gene editing is also making strides in cancer research. While the approach has not yet been approved for use in humans, researchers at Pitt announced on Monday that they had used the potentially revolutionary technology to remove cancer genes that promote malignancy.

Athens (AFP)
French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday lashed "the lazy... the cynics (and) the extreme" who opposed their plans to overhaul the country's labour laws, in remarks that sparked outrage from the radical left and far right.
The 39-year-old centrist sees revamping France's complex labour regulations as key to tackling France's tenaciously high unemployment rate, currently 9.5 percent -- roughly twice that of Britain or Germany.
Returning to controversial remarks they made last month, Macron said on a two-day state visit to Greece: "France is not a country which is open to reforms."
"France does not reform ... because we rebel, we resist, we circumvent. This is what we are like," they told expatriates at a French archaeology school in Athens.
They said they took responsibility for similar comments made in Romania on August 24 about France's reputed aversion to change.
Macron said the pressing need was "a profound transformation in France" especially with regard to labour policy.
They stressed their reforms would be carried out "without brutality, with composure, with reason and pragmatism."
The president stressed their "absolute determination" to press ahead with the scheme.
"I will not yield anything, either to the lazy, the cynics or the extreme. And I ask you to have the same determination, each day."
The new measures are aimed at helping small businesses by allowing bosses to negotiate contract terms and conditions directly with their employees without union involvement.
They also cap the sometimes prohibitive costs of firing employees by limiting court awards for unfair dismissals and make it easier for multinationals operating in France to lay off workers.
The Communist-backed CGT, France's biggest union, has said it will stage street protests next month -- a move that has often torpedoed similar reforms in the past -- although other unions have not said they will join the rallies.
Macron's new comments sparked a backlash back home from the far left and far right.
"The president is insulting people who oppose their politics. Emmanuel Macron does not love the French, that's for sure" Pierre Laurent, secretary general of the French Communist Party, said in a tweet.
Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the France Unbowed movement, who finished fourth in this year's presidential election, joined the outcry.
For Macron to speak ill of compatriots "in front of foreigners and while they are abroad is double the cheek and twice as insulting," Melenchon said on Facebook.
On the far right, Florian Philippot, vice president of the National Front party said "insulting people has become second nature for Macron."
The presidency however put out a statement saying that Macron had merely recalled the challenges facing France and the reforms necessary to overcome them.
"He concluded by repeating their determination to act against all the conservatism that has prevented France from reforming," the Elysee presidential palace said.

“Pagan” is most commonly used in our interconnected religious communities as an umbrella term for any of the religions that either seek to revive a pre-Christian religion, or belong in the New Religious Movement category, such as Wicca. The religions under this umbrella are often more varied than they are similar and Ōraḥ Qaḏǝmōnī is no exception. ʼŌraḥ Qaḏǝmōnī, which translates as “path of the ancients,” is in the Canaanite family of religions and seeks to revive the practice of the Israelites of the 15th through 9th centuries BCE. Back then, it was primarily a tribal religion with centralized religious spaces and large festivals focused around a reconstructed lunisolar calendar. The practice also included a strong sense of household and familial tradition, including ancestor veneration, personal prayer, blessings over food, and family events.
The Wild Hunt spoke to Ryan Dial, who is an ʼAlūp̄, or High Priest, for Ancient Path Assembly in Atlanta about this religion and how it is currently practiced.
The Wild Hunt: I realize it's probably complex, but can you explain a bit about ʼŌraḥ Qaḏǝmōnī?
Ryan Dial: ʼŌraḥ Qaḏǝmōnī is a revivalist faith, which is similar to polytheistic reconstructions in many ways in that we utilize archaeology, anthropology, linguistics, etc. with academic conjecture to revive an ancient faith system, but unlike recons, we don't necessarily shy away from unverified personal gnosis (UPG) and we seek to update and move forward beyond simple reconstruction. More specifically, we are a religion within the larger category of Canaanite Reconstructionism/Revivalism, which includes reconstructions of Phoenician, Moabite, Amonite, Judahite, Edomite, and Israelite religions, itself, genealogically speaking, a sub-category of the Northwestern Semitic religious family [Amorite and Ugaritic religions] which is, in turn, a sub-category of the Northern Semitic religious family [Akkadian and Eblaite religions]. All of that is in the modern nations of Israel, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.
Like many recons and revivalists, not all of our practitioners consider themselves “Pagan.” That tends to be a loaded term, unfortunately, and carries with it many connotations both from the outside world and from within the greater Pagan community. As such, I consider myself an ʼŌrēḥa, first and foremost, and depending on the audience, I may or may not also identify as a Pagan.
TWH: What part of the world did this religion originate from and is it similar to Judaism?
RD: ʼŌraḥ Qaḏǝmōnī is a revival of ancient Israelite religion. This is not the religion of the Bible, which was Judahite, but the religion of the northern Kingdom of Israel and its citystate and tribal predecessors. The Israelites were a confederation of Canaanite tribes.
We reconstruct primarily from the 15th through the 9th centuries BCE. The Israelites were conquered by Assyria during the 720s BCE. Prior to this, Judahite religion had already diverged and begun to become monotheistic. With the destruction of the Kingdom of Israel in the 720s, many Israelites fled south and added unique religious elements to the largely monotheistic Judahite national faith. Some of these survived in the Bible as Judahite religion slowly evolved into Judaism and Christianity in the early centuries CE, but by and large, Israelite religion had ended by that point. Some have shown survival of some elements of Israelite religion into the later religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Neoplatonism, thanks to the works of Iamblichus, who was themselves of Canaanite stock.
We honor the Canaanite pantheon, which has roughly 150 deities of several “families,” much like the Aesir and Vanir in Germanic religions or the Asuras and Devas in Indo-Iranian religions. We're monolatrous-panentheists with a emanationist slant. That is to say, while we believe in many gods, we believe that they, like all things in existence, including ourselves, are emanations of a singular divine force which we call Yǝhōwāh (lit. “Existence”). Additionally, while we support the idea that the gods of other peoples exist in some form, we believe that they, too, are emanations of Yǝhōwāh, though only our gods, the ʼĔlōhē͡ī-Kənaʻan, the “Godhead of Canaan,” should be worshiped by members of our faith. The theology is a bit more complicated than that, so think of this as a simplification.
TWH: What are the main ethics in your religion and how does it shape your daily life?
RD: Personally, I think the observance of Šeḇaʻ hāʼĪmărōṯ, “The Seven Teachings,” is by far the most important. They are seven philosophical teachings that form the core of our faith system, and as such, all practitioners, regardless of level, are expected to keep them. …
Yəhōwāh is one and all things are unity.
All that exists is part of the divine and, therefore, forms a singular existence. A human, an animal, a plant, and dirt are all part of a unity and there is no separation between them. We must recognize the divine in all things, in all people, and within ourselves.
All actions will have consequences.
We are all responsible for our actions, regardless of the circumstances, and nothing can absolve us of that responsibility. The choices we make are up to us, and every choice has consequences, many far-reaching and incapable of being predicted.
Will governs actions.
It is intent, the force of will, that governs our actions. Through proper intent, we can commit to a life of proper action. Approaching the world with selfish, individualist intent will most assuredly result in actions with negative consequences for all affected.
Speak support, practice harmony, and in all things, be at peace.
Our actions should always strive to create harmony, peace, and beauty in this world. We should strive to teach others through our example, not our words.
Generosity, humility, calm, and joy are the path to wellbeing.
Through generosity, we can aid our world. Through humility, we can be content with ourselves and with others. Through calm, we can maintain proper intent and see the world for its beauty. And through joy, we can spread wellbeing to those who need it most. Through these concepts, we can learn to love ourselves and others.We should be careful to guard ourselves against their opposites: greed, jealousy, anger, and self-loathing. It is through the concept of greed that the illusion of possession arises, and through the illusion of possession, we are prone to jealousy, anger, and self-loathing.
One who is merciful, compassionate, and kind to the smallest creatures joins to Yəhōwāh.
We should always seek mercy, compassion, and kindness, whenever possible. From the insect in our home to the poverty-stricken on the street, we should strive to honor the divine within all. We should always seek to aid those in need and prevent malevolence, cruelty, and hostility to all creation.
Love others freely and with deep passion.
Without crass individualism and selfish concepts of ownership, we can freely love one another. We should seek to love others purely, with our whole soul, and love them for the unique expressions of the divine that they are. In all of our relationships, we should be devoted wholly and love them as the entirety of existence.
TWH: Could you explain what a religious observance might look like and why explain how it is still relevant today?
RD: One of our more important holidays is Ḥaḡ haMaṣōṯ, a week-long festival celebrating the beginning of the barley harvest. It begins with the Pesaḥ ritual, a protection ceremony which originally secured the gods' protection over the barley while it was being harvested and stored. During the ritual, we make an offering of barley into a sacred flame. This offering is followed by a week of feasting and merriment, with song and dance and firelit stories. We reenact these rituals with a modern twist, asking for protection over our livelihoods, our modern subsistence methods.
RD: I began this path as an Orthodox Jew, actually. I wasn't raised in a religious home, but I came to Orthodox Judaism on my own in college while looking for some of those “big question” answers. My pursuits began in Kabbalah and moved into Chasidism and eventually the religion of my more recent ancestors, Sephardi Judaism. I began a path that led to me seeking to join the rabbinate.
During this same time, I was studying cultural anthropology and anthropology of religion at Emory University, focusing on the early phases of Near Eastern religion. Over time, my intellectual pursuits and my religious pursuits came into conflict, and I found myself leaving the rabbinical path and, ultimately, Judaism altogether. My draw was always to the ancient Near East — it felt like home to me — so I said to myself, “There must be something to this, to the religion of the ancient Canaanites, that draws me in. If I am so in love with their faith, why not practice it in the modern era?” From there, I began seeking out groups that were doing what I was doing. I've now been on this path for almost 3 years. It's an evolving religion, tied in so closely with academic research and archaeological discovery, but we've stabilized over those 3 years and have really come into our own as a living faith.
TWH: Do you know how many people practice your faith and are there groups who meet in person?
RD: ʼŌraḥ Qaḏǝmōnī is a communal faith, a tribal religion formed from an intentional tribe bound not by blood but by choice. As such, meeting in person is rather necessary for our practice. Thanks to the wonders of the internet, we have individuals with varying levels of interest and practice quite literally across the world, but our central home is Atlanta, GA [Ancient Path Assembly Atlanta], where our physical group currently meets. As with most Pagan groups, it's hard to get a good number on just how many members and interested parties we actually have. Rituals tend to stay small, most likely due to their rapid frequency and non-western calendar, we don't move rituals to the weekend. I know of two other extant groups that identify as somewhere within the Canaanite sphere — Natib Qadish and Am HaAretz, AMHA or the Primitive Hebrew Assembly, though, again, it is hard to get a definite number on the total size of the Canaanite polytheist community.

White House aide Kellyanne Conway complained on Fox News that the media cares too much about Russia and not enough about Donald Trump's disastrous health care "plan."
White House spinmeister Kellyanne Conway was at it again Friday, complaining that the “lazy” media refuses to trumpet “all the good that's happening in this administration.”
During an appearance on the most pro-Trump show, “Fox & Friends,” on TV's most Trump-friendly channel, Conway attacked non-Fox reporters for their “Russia obsession.”
The problem, according to Conway, is that “it's a heck of a lot easier to sit around and scream ‘Russia! Russia! Russia!'” than to report on Trump's deeply unpopular plan to repeal Obamacare, or their plan to give massive tax cuts to the rich.
.@KellyannePolls: It's easier for the media to scream Russia than to report on the intricacies of health care pic.twitter.com/A7DgTbtZJD — FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 14, 2017
CONWAY: We are not telling the American people all the good that's happening in this administration, for a couple reasons. First is because of the Russia obsession — as I call it, the Russian concussion, the Russian percussion. But secondly, and this doesn't get covered at all, it's a heck of a lot easier to sit around and scream “Russia! Russia! Russia!” with no basis than to go learn the finer points on the new health care bill, than to really dig in and understand the simplicity and the fairness and the middle-class tax relief in the new tax reform plan that's being developed right behind me. It's just easier to be lazy and just scream “Russia! Russia!”
Conway's embarrassing new rhyming obsession aside, it's a ridiculous charge to make. Not only has the media extensively covered the GOP's plan to undo Obamacare, but in the past week alone, the so-called “Russia concussion” has evolved to include Trump's son and son-in-law meeting with a Kremlin-linked attorney and former Soviet counterintelligence officer to get dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Nearly everyone in Trump's inner circle, including their family, has lawyered up. Even Trump's own lawyer now has a spokesperson. The “obsession” isn't driven by laziness; it's driven by the rapidly growing mountain of evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to win the White House.
The non-Fox media is perfectly capable of covering multiple issues, such as health care and Russia, at the same time, no matter how much the White House wishes it were not so.
Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner and former frontbencher Lisa Nandy are give top-billing at today's Open Labour conference.
Held today in Manchester, the soft-left group are holding their summer conference, called ‘the path to power'.
The group said in a statement: “Open Labour are looking forward to celebrating Labour's fantastic gains. Not least with new Open Labour MPs like Alex Sobel MP, Emma Hardy MP, Rosie Duffield MP and councillors like our co-chairs Tom Miller and Bev Craig.”
“We are also looking forward to discussing how they and the rest of us can play a role in delivering a Labour victory at the next election with a radical, transformative programme of government.”
“We've taken big steps forward but there is further to go on the path to power. In that spirit, let's get started.”
The residents of Middleborough, Massachusetts, have had enough of this *#%@&!
And on Monday night they voted to make those who curse put their money where their potty mouths are - to the sum of $20, that is.
Police in the town of 22,000 will be writing tickets bearing fines in that amount to those who foul its public places with profanity after residents voted 183-50 Monday night that they were mad as *#%@& and weren't going to take it anymore.
Overheard on CNN.com: What the $%#;!? Choice words for town's profanity fine
"If I didn't hear 10 kids drop the F-bombs between my store and a block and half I would be shocked," local business owner Mimi Duphily told CNN affiliate WHDH. They were one of those who pushed for cops to clean up the *#%@&.
Not everyone was pleased with the plan.
“This comes under the context of trying to legislate morality or good parenting,” resident Adam Bond told those gathered at the annual town meeting Monday night, in the town that calls itself the "cranberry capital of the world."
So what words are over the line in Middlleborough?
That will be at the discretion of police, but they'll be directing their enforcement efforts at those using profanity to accost others, Officer Steven Nelson said Tuesday.
“It's not going to be just someone walking down the street dropping the F-bomb; it's going to be when you're actually making it uncomfortable for everyone else,” Duphily told WHDH.
Note that Middleborough is only 38 miles from Boston and Fenway Park, where Red Sox fans bestowed a profane nickname on New York Yankee Bucky Dent after the light-hitting shortstop homered in the seventh inning of a tiebreaker game in 1978.
Call them Bucky "Bleeping" Dent in Middleborough and it'll cost you $20.
Fans are sad and upset about the way 'Music Bank' treated BASTARZ. Their complaints are circulating online and even other fans are sympathizing their concerns.
Let's take a look at their complaints.
First, the week prior to their comeback, 'Music Bank' failed to include BASTARZ for next weeks show even though VIXX and EXO-CBX both did. See the screen shots below.
Then this week -- the week of their comeback after 1 year and 6 months -- BASTARZ was not included in the special comeback interview room. Again, VIXX and EXO-CBX were included and given time to promote their comeback.
On top of that, BASTARZ did not get to pre-record their song (like many groups do for their comeback special), and they also only performed one song, "Make It Rain" when other groups sang two songs each.
VIXX did two songs; title song was a pre-recorded stage.
So did EXO-CBX. They had a pre-recorded stage and an extra song for their comeback.
To make things worse, fans are upset that 'Music Bank' did not let BASTARZ fans to come into the live show, so there no fan chants for the group while they were performing.
Here is the video from their comeback stage on 'Music Bank.'
What do you think about the way 'Music Bank' treated BASTARZ's comeback week? Do you agree with their fans?
New Here? Welcome! Dear Wendy is a relationship advice blog. You can read about me here , peruse the archives here and read popular posts here . You can also follow along on Facebook and Instagram . If you have a relationship/dating question I can help answer, you can send me your letters at [email protected] (be sure to read these guidelines first). Thanks for visiting!
In a feature I call “Your Turn,” in which you, the readers, get to answer the question, I'm presenting the following letter without commentary from me:
I wrote in two years ago about having never been kissed . Well, now that I've been kissed and have had my first relationship, I have a new question for you.
I broke up with my boyfriend of over 1 1/2 years in April. I love them very much, but I don't feel like I'm in love with him. Meaning, I care about them and their feelings but want to date other people. I'm 24, just out of college, and they were my first and only boyfriend. They didn't do anything wrong; for the most part they were a great boyfriend (which is part of the reason he's having a hard time accepting the breakup). I was just bored. We share no common interests or hobbies and have no interest in participating in each other's hobbies or interests. We're two completely different people who fought all the time. We both admit that, if we had spent more time getting to know each other (we were “official” after our first date), we probably never would have gotten together.
When we were together, they had a low-paying job and could never afford to take me out. Now he's got a new job making double what they made and wants to take me out all the time. I tell them not to do those things if he's trying to get back together with me, but they say they just does them to make me happy and because they love me. I must admit, I am enjoying these dinners and gifts only because I hardly ever got them when we were together, but it's definitely blurring the lines, so I have to stop letting them do this.
Sometimes I feel like I will never find another guy who loves me the way my ex did. I'm afraid I'll find someone else but end up getting hurt and want to go back to the ex, but it will be too late. So maybe I should ignore the lack of “spark” and “chemistry” and just be with someone who loves me more than I love him. Then I think, maybe I think that because I've never been in another relationship and have nothing at all to compare this feeling to. Advice? — Afraid to Miss My One Chance
We can confirm that the Dogecoin car is real.
The internet currency movement raised enough money to sponsor Josh Wise at Talladega and on Sunday night, Wise's Phil Parsons Racing team released pictures of what the car will look like when it takes to the track on Friday.

There's no denying its a Dogecoin car. We especially love the dog on the back bumper. That's an intimidating image for anyone behind Wise. Will it prevent them from having any drafting partners?
The wrap for the car was $55,000 and the Dogecoin subforum over at Reddit already has a question-and-answer thread up for anyone intrigued by the car over the weekend.
Before sponsoring Wise, Dogecoin sponsored an Indian luger and the Jamaican bobsled team at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

A trio of key conservative senators is publicly raising concerns about the GOP bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare, specifically questioning the decision to draft the legislation behind closed doors.
Sen. Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeePush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback The Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump escalates fight with NY Times MORE (R-Utah) said Tuesday he's getting calls from constituents concerned about the Senate healthcare bill, which is still being finalized.
"If you're frustrated by the lack of transparency in this process I share your frustration. I share it wholeheartedly,” they said in a Facebook Live video.
“The American people need and deserve to be able to see legislation as it moves through the Senate," Lee added.

They said they back voting on a healthcare bill "soon," but said the Senate bill should have already been released if the chamber were to vote next week.
"We should have been able to see it weeks ago if we were going to voting on it next week," Lee said.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse to push back at Trump on border Democrats block abortion bill in Senate Overnight Energy: Climate protesters storm McConnell's office | Center-right group says Green New Deal could cost trillion | Dire warnings from new climate studies MORE (R-Ky.) told reporters on Tuesday that they expect to have a "draft discussion" of the Senate's healthcare bill ready on Thursday.
Republicans want to hold a vote on the bill as soon as next week. They aren't expected to hold a hearing on the legislation, and several GOP senators signaled Tuesday that they are still unsure about what would be included in the legislation.
Lee is a member of the working group convened by McConnell, but said they haven't seen the draft text yet and hasn't been involved in writing the legislation.
"It has become increasingly apparent in the last few days that even though we thought we were going to be in charge of writing a bill within this working group, it's not being written by us. It's apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership in the Senate," they said during the Facebook interview.
Sen. Rand Paul Randal (Rand) Howard PaulThe Hill's Morning Report — Emergency declaration to test GOP loyalty to Trump The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump escalates fight with NY Times The 10 GOP senators who may break with Trump on emergency MORE (R-Ky.) seemed to echo Lee's concerns, and demurred Tuesday when asked if they thought they would have enough time to review the bill.
They told reporters "that's a big question,” they said, adding, “Healthcare is such an important thing. I think we should have debated it in open, in committee hearings, have both sides bring in witnesses.”
Paul has recently focused on a push to keep some of ObamaCare's subsidies in the GOP legislation, and warned on Tuesday that they aren't inclined to support "anything that's a new entitlement program."
"I'm not saying how I'm voting ‘til I see what's in the bill. I still think there's a chance that if we don't get 50 votes, we renegotiate what's in the bill completely. I think we could start over," they told Bloomberg.
Sen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzTrump unleashing digital juggernaut ahead of 2020 Inviting Kim Jong-un to Washington Trump endorses Cornyn for reelection as O'Rourke mulls challenge MORE (R-Texas), who is also a member of the working group with Lee, defended the process on Tuesday, arguing that complaints from Democrats who feel left out of the process are "fairly amusing."
"There has been no political issue in modern times more debated than ObamaCare," they told reporters.
But Cruz also signaled dissatisfaction with the emerging Senate legislation, saying it's "got a long way to go."
"In particular, we need [to do] a substantially better job of driving down the cost of premiums. That remains my number one priority," they said.
Cruz, Lee, and Paul represent three key conservative votes for GOP leadership.
Republicans have a 52-seat majority in the Senate, meaning they can only lose two GOP votes and still be able to use Vice President Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PencePence meeting with Senate GOP ahead of vote to block emergency declaration 'And the award for best political commentary by an Oscar nominee goes to...' UN nuclear watchdog: Iran maintains compliance with 2015 pact MORE to break a tie.
Cruz, Lee and Paul previously teamed up to push for "full repeal" of ObamaCare.
If they band together on the Senate legislation, they would be able to block any bill they opposed.
Conservatives are warning Senate leadership against moving the bill too far to the middle. They've specifically taken issue with a longer phase out of Medicaid expansion and keeping in place some of ObamaCare's taxes for longer than the House-passed bill.
A GOP source familiar with the negotiations also told The Hill that McConnell has so far refused to promise conservatives to let states opt out of the community rating requirement — which keeps health plans more affordable for sick people but sends premiums soaring — or to exempt states altogether from the regulatory mandate and allow them to opt in.
A newly-published video shows a Colorado Springs police officer going to extremes during a November 2013 arrest, slamming a handcuffed 18-year-old woman face-down into the ground, knocking out their teeth while they were in hospital.
The shocking video will be part of a lawsuit that is being prepared on behalf of Alexis Acker against the department. The footage was obtained by the Colorado Springs Independent daily.
"This is a very violent attack on someone who is in handcuffs, who is partially restrained and tiny, and there's just no need for it," Acker's criminal attorney Cindy Hyatt told the paper.
"You can't have something like this, whether it happens 100 times, 10 times or one time. It's unacceptable. It cannot be tolerated. As a patrol officer in particular, that's part of the job, dealing with that without planting someone's face in the floor," they added.
The video shows Colorado Springs officer Tyler Walker, 29 at the time, clearly shoving the handcuffed woman into a chair by hitting them in the stomach. They then grabs Acker out of their seat and slams them on to the hospital floor. Aside from having two teeth knocked out, they suffered "trauma to the face, head, teeth and jaw; migraine headaches, concussion, closed head injuries, memory and cognitive function problems, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder."
Meanwhile, conflicting police reports state that Walker either "escorted them to the floor" or that they "rolled them ... to the floor."
The incident took place after officers received calls of a disturbance involving a gun and were sent to check out Acker's apartment. They reportedly found no probable cause. But, according to police, the woman was "intoxicated and verbally uncooperative with police," while their boyfriend, Tyrin Tanks, was wanted on an outstanding warrant, according to Walker's report.

Acker allegedly became "physically combative" when officers arrested their 19-year-old boyfriend. They reportedly kicked at officers who pinned them down on a sofa and arrested them on multiple charges, including resisting arrest and assault on a police officer.
Walker drove Acker to Memorial Hospital for a "medical clearance" before taking them to jail "due to their intoxication level and combative nature," they wrote in their report.
At the hospital, Walker's report claims they told Acker to sit down. When they refused they "pushed them down into the chair," but Acker kicked them "in the groin area." They said they felt "immediate pain" and "forcefully threw Ms. Acker ... face down on the ground."
The officer added that, "After my adrenalin wore off," they began to feel pain in their left knee, an injury they allegedly suffered by throwing the woman down. Four days later, Detective Christine Somersalmi contacted Walker "to notify them of their victim's rights."
Acker has been meanwhile charged with five offenses, including two felony assaults on a police officer.  They are seeking $500,000 in damages due to lingering health problems.

"She has injuries that will be permanent. Not only the dental, the jaw. They have a head injury. I think they are still with their doctors trying to get to the bottom of what that is," KKTV has quoted Hyatt as saying.
According to their criminal attorney, Acker has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor obstruction of a police officer and felony menacing, receiving a deferred sentence on the felony.
Another video was released earlier this week, after months of legal battles, showing officers fatally shooting an unarmed man in the Los Angeles suburbs after mistaking them and two others for robbery suspects. The City of Gardena paid out $4.7 million to settle a federal lawsuit with the family of the deceased and their brother, who was injured during confrontation with police. Local authorities had been struggling to keep the dramatic video private, however. The incident happened early morning of June 2, 2013, when Ricardo Diaz-Zeferino was stopped by police investigating a bicycle theft. The 34-year-old was trying to help their brother find their stolen bike when they were rounded up as a suspect instead. Witnesses said Zeferino attempted to tell officers that two other bicycle-riding friends they had stopped were the wrong men. The newly-released video showed “the cold-blooded shooting of clearly unarmed men,” an attorney for some of the men, R. Samuel Paz, told the LA Times.
A UC Riverside student sued Wells Fargo in federal court Monday, saying the bank illegally denied loans to young immigrants who have temporary legal status under an Obama-era program.
UCR student Mitzie Perez sought a student loan through Wells Fargo's website and was denied because they acknowledged that she's not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, according to the suit filed by the Los Angeles-based Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
Perez, the suit's lead plaintiff, is part of former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, commonly called DACA. The program was enacted in 2012 by an executive order.
It allows people who arrived in the United States before age 16, and who meet certain other criteria, to defer deportation. They are granted Social Security numbers and can get work permits, continue their education and apply for permission to travel in and out of the country.
Perez had the necessary documentation to meet bank requirements, the suit said. The suit was filed on behalf of Perez and “all others similarly situated.”
“We need to bring this to light and hear from Wells Fargo – why they're denying DACA recipients from student loans when all we want to do is continue our education,” said Perez, 25, of San Dimas.
“I'm at the point of maybe having to drop out of school because I can't afford it,” added Perez, a third-year student majoring in gender and sexuality studies.
Wells Fargo, in a statement, said it was disappointed the plaintiffs sued instead of working directly with the bank to find a solution.
“Wells Fargo understands the dream of pursuing higher education, and we remain focused on our responsible lending practices to assist temporary and permanent residents and U.S. citizens in obtaining student financing,” the bank said in a statement.
The lawsuit contends Wells Fargo violated federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination based on immigration status. The suit seeks class-action status on behalf of other DACA beneficiaries who have been denied loans by Wells Fargo. It also seeks unspecified monetary damages.
The lawsuit was filed at the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California and comes amid concerns that the DACA program will be ended by President Donald Trump, who signed executive orders last week that toughen federal immigration laws.
“All students should be treated equally in accessing the loan assistance needed to complete a university education,” said Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, in a statement.

A bill seeking to soften penalties for possession of marijuana for personal use could have its first reading in Parliament on Thursday.
The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) (Amendment) Bill 2015 is listed under private members' business on the Order Paper.
APNU+AFC MP Michael Carrington is to move a motion seeking approval of the National Assembly for the introduction and first reading of the bill in accordance with Standing Order No. 52 (1).
Carrington's move follows a public outcry over the sentencing in November of football coach Vibert Butts to three years imprisonment for possession of 46 grammes of cannabis which they had said was for their private use. Butts is out on bail while the sentence is being appealed. According to the law, possession of any amount of cannabis over 15 grammes is considered trafficking, which is an offence that carries a minimum sentence of three years.
A number of protests were held over the sentencing and last month sixteen representatives of several Rastafarian organisations met with the Attorney General Basil Williams at their invitation in the AG's Chambers and a key issue discussed was the decriminalisation of two ounces of marijuana for personal use.
The AG informed the Rastafarian Representatives that in keeping with the Government's mandate of consultation and transparency, the issue will be raised at Cabinet.
Members of the Rastafarian community had staged a picketing exercise on December 3, 2015 outside the Attorney General Chambers on the matter but the AG was out of office at the time.
While acknowledging that the laws and by extension the penalties for cannabis offences ought to be reviewed, Minister of Public Security Khemraj Ramjattan speaking to Stabroek News last month also argued that the current absence of a clear sentencing policy is a problem.
When asked for their views on the calls, including by the Rastafarian community, for repeal of the law governing the possession of cannabis, Ramjattan stated that all the laws, and especially the penalties, need to be reviewed.
A clear sentencing policy, they further said, needs to be worked out by the Chancellor and other members of the judiciary. An example, they said, would be to limit the penalty to a one-year maximum sentence.
They added that public opprobrium over the issue is being seen due to the absence of clear sentencing guidelines.
According to Ramjattan, magistrates and judges need to be conscious of public opinion and it is also important that the circumstances of a case be understood. They said that the entire debate is more of a sentencing matter than a need for the legislature to change the law.
MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. - A man was shot in the face Friday in a road-rage incident in southwest Miami-Dade County, authorities said.
The incident was reported at Southwest 248th Street and Southwest 207th Avenue.
Miami-Dade police Detective Robin Pinkard said the man was flown to Jackson South Community Hospital in critical condition. They said the shooter fled in a white truck.
The victim's co-worker told Local 10 News that the man was driving a truck for a moving company called Two Men and a Truck. They said the victim honked at a driver for running a red light, and the driver pulled out a gun and shot at the moving truck.
"All we did was beep the horn at him," the co-worker said. "We tried to keep going, but they followed us and fired off a shot at us."
Police are searching for the shooter.

ROMANS 11:25-36
« Romans 10 | Romans 11 | Romans 12 »
The Mystery of Israel's Salvation
25 Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
26 And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, “The Deliverer will come from Zion, they will banish ungodliness from Jacob”;
27 “and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins.”
28 As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
29 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
30 For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
31 so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.
32 For God has consigned all to disobedience, that they may have mercy on all.
33 Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are their judgments and how inscrutable their ways!
34 “For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been their counselor?”
35 “Or who has given a gift to them that they might be repaid?”
In Russia, public support for Joseph Stalin's personality and approval for their policies have increased, but the attitude to Stalinism in society remains balanced, according to the latest research.
On Thursday, independent pollster the Levada Center released the results of its December poll about the public's attitude toward Stalinism. According to the poll, 34 percent of respondents (up from 28 percent in 2007) say that leading the Soviet people to victory in the Second World War was such a great achievement that it outweighed the Soviet dictator's vices and mistakes.
Twenty percent of respondents (compared to 14 percent in 2007) agreed with the statement that “Stalin was a wise leader who made the Soviet Union a powerful and prosperous nation.” The share of those who hold that only a harsh and cruel person could maintain order in the country in Stalin's times remained unchanged since 2007 at 15 percent.
READ MORE: Communists want Stalin's name back on Russian map
Twelve percent of Russians think that their people need another leader similar to Stalin and sooner or later such person will appear and “restore order in the country.”
The share of critical appraisals of Stalin as a person and their role in Russian history has decreased since 2007. Twenty-one percent of Russians agree that Stalin was “a cruel and inhumane tyrant responsible for the killings of millions of innocent people” (29 percent in 2007). Thirteen percent blame Stalin for insufficient measures to prepare the USSR for Hitler's invasion (17 percent in 2007).
Eleven percent of Russians told researchers that the people had yet to learn the whole truth about Stalin and their times, compared to 30 percent in 2007.
Russian politicians eagerly use Stalin's name and controversies surrounding it for political PR. While right-wing parties put the stress on the horrors of Stalinist purges, the left-wing, especially the Communist Party, emphasize their successes in the country's industrialization and in keeping corruption at extremely low levels.
In December, Communists in the central Russian city of Penza unveiled their plan to mark the 80th anniversary of the 1936 USSR Constitution by declaring 2016 the “Year of Stalin” and opening a museum dedicated to the Soviet dictator.

In February 2015, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov appealed to President Vladimir Putin to rename the city of Volgograd “Stalingrad,” and also to give Stalin's name and a monument to a square in Moscow. The authorities rejected the proposal, saying that most Russians would not welcome such moves.
The only time in recent history when Russia officially commemorated Stalin took place in 2013, when the Volgograd city legislature voted to call the city “Stalingrad” in official addresses, but only on the dates of major holidays and commemorative dates.
FULLTIME DAD: Craig Bullen gave up work to be the sole carer of their son, Miles, 16 months
Kiwi fathers need four weeks paid parental leave, the Families Commission says.
Families Commissioner Gregory Fortuin said "the initial bonding phase with a child is crucial for a child's development" and fathers needed their own leave entitlement.
"When a strong attachment is made, the positive effects are felt throughout the child's life," Fortuin said.
At present, fathers are entitled to two weeks unpaid leave. Mothers can transfer up to 14 weeks of their paid parental leave entitlement to their partner.
However, a commission report, Supporting Kiwi Dads, shows almost half the 1721 fathers surveyed were unable to take parental leave.
The report also found that fathers from all backgrounds were satisfied they were doing a good job as parents and they believed they were more engaged with their children compared with their own fathers.
"Overall, fathers report that they are doing a great job, spend about 37 hours a week with their children, and are involved in a variety of aspects of their children's lives, such as homework and changing nappies."
However, most fathers wanted to spend more time with their children.
The report also found fathers were heavily involved in family chores, with fathers usually splitting responsibility for housework and childcare evenly with their partners.
Harald Breiding-Buss, of the Christchurch Father & Child Trust, yesterday praised the report.
"We've been trying to tell service organisations that things have changed and parents see this [raising children] as a partnership.
"Fathers and mothers raise children together, and this report shows this is the reality."
They said men were unlikely to take parental leave away from mothers and needed their own guaranteed paid leave.
Sacrifices made to be a father
Craig Bullen, 40, became a first-time father last year.
Eight weeks after their son Miles was born, Bullen became the baby's sole carer.
At the time, Christchurch-based Bullen was working as a labourer for TransDiesel in Hornby.
Within three days, Bullen went from fulltime worker to fulltime father and immediately applied for paid parental leave.
However, they said they were told by Inland Revenue that they would not get paid leave because they were a father.
"I was livid," Bullen said. "I now understand what women have been going through for a long time, being discriminated against because of your sex."
Bullen had to leave their job to look after their son and the bills began to pile up.
They applied for the domestic purposes benefit from Work and Income, and now receives $419 a week.
However, it was difficult, they said.
"I'm on $419 a week and I'm used to $800 a week when I worked," they said.
"It's tough. It's like being on an island at times.
"You haven't got the money to go anywhere. You cope.
"You get out, you go walking. It is hard. It was a big shock."
They said they missed their job and having company, but their son had to come first.
"It was not an easy decision to make, but I have no regrets at all."
Bullen said they were doing a good job as a father. "It just came naturally to me."
A first-grade teacher at a Silver Spring elementary school was charged with several counts of assault Tuesday, when authorities accused them of choking and, in some cases, punching half the 16 students in their class.
The incidents happened in December, in their class full of 6- and 7-year-old students, Montgomery County police said. None of the students was harmed seriously enough to require medical treatment or show visible injuries, law enforcement officials said.
It is uncommon for teachers to be charged criminally over actions in their classrooms, particularly physical encounters against multiple children.
Montgomery school officials said they learned of the allegations Jan. 4 and immediately removed the teacher, Susan Lee Burke, from Greencastle Elementary School and placed them on administrative leave. School officials looked into the accusations and referred the matter to child protective services workers.
Separately, on Jan. 7, a 7-year-old boy arrived at the Briggs Chaney police substation with a parent, said Capt. Paul Starks, a police spokesperson. The boy said Burke had assaulted them numerous times, according to documents filed to support their arrest.
Detectives eventually interviewed all of the students in their class and found that eight said they had been assaulted, police said.
"All of the victims described being choked by the suspect," detectives wrote in the arrest records. "Some of the students, in addition to being choked, stated they were kicked, punched, scratched or had their arms squeezed tightly by Susan Burke."
It is unclear whether Burke has retained a lawyer for the assault charges. A phone message left at Burke's home was not returned. A man who picked up the phone listed to Burke's father declined to discuss the matter.
"I have no comments. Thank you," they said before hanging up.
Burke remained in the Montgomery jail late Tuesday. A court commissioner set their bond at $75,000. If they do not post it, they will probably go before a judge for a bond review Wednesday afternoon.
Burke was hired by the Montgomery school system in 2001. They taught at Meadow Hall Elementary School in Rockville for eight years before making a volunteer transfer in 2009 to Greencastle, schools spokesperson Dana Tofig said.
Doris Videla, president of Greencastle's PTA, was stunned.
The protective shipping container with Intelsat 33e is unloaded from a chartered An-124 jetliner at Félix Eboué Airport, which was followed by the satellite's transfer by road to the Spaceport.
One of two Intelsat satellites that will be orbited on Arianespace's next Ariane 5 mission has been delivered to the Spaceport, advancing pre-launch activities for this August 24 heavy-lift flight to the payload preparation phase.
Intelsat 33e “touched down” in French Guiana yesterday, arriving at Félix Eboué Airport near Cayenne aboard a chartered Antonov An-124 cargo jetliner. After unloading, the spacecraft was transferred by road to the Spaceport, where it was moved into the S5 payload processing facility for the start of pre-flight checkout.
The satellite was produced by Boeing Space Systems. Once in orbit, it will extend Intelsat's high-throughput capacity in both C- and Ku-band from the Americas to include Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean regions. In addition, Intelsat 33e will deliver enterprise-grade, broadband services to aeronautical and maritime mobility service providers and users.
As the second spacecraft of the next-generation Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. It has a liftoff mass estimated at 6,575 kg. and will operate from an orbital position of 60 deg. East following its launch by Ariane 5.
The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission performed last January.
Joining Intelsat 33e on the dual-passenger August 24 flight is another satellite for Intelsat, Intelsat 36 – which was built by SSL (Space Systems Loral) and will enhance the international operator's premier direct-to-home neighborhood in Africa. This spacecraft's liftoff mass is estimated at 3,250 kg., and it is set to operate from a 68.5 deg. East orbital slot.
The upcoming Ariane 5 mission to geostationary transfer orbit with Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 is designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's launcher family numbering system, and will be performed from the Spaceport's ELA-3 launch zone in French Guiana.

Prime minister accepts resignation of Mark Harper, who launched government's 'go home' campaign last year
The immigration minister, Mark Harper, has resigned for employing an illegal immigrant as a cleaner, Downing Street said on Saturday.
Number 10 said there was "no suggestion that Mr Harper knowingly employed an illegal immigrant" but the prime minister, David Cameron, had "accepted their resignation with regret".
Last year Harper launched a government advertising campaign that targeted racially mixed areas with mobile billboards warning illegal immigrants to "go home or face arrest".
In their resignation letter Harper said that while they had not broken the law as an employer, they believed that their position meant they must "hold myself to a higher standard than expected of others".
They conceded that they "should have checked more thoroughly" when they took on the highly sensitive role that the documents provided by the cleaner were genuine.
In 2007 when they were recruited to look after their London flat they were given a copy of their passport and a Home Office letter stating that they had indefinite leave to remain in the UK and the right to work and run a business.
Last month – mindful that they were steering the immigration bill through the Commons and publicly warning employers of the need to check the status of employees – they sought fresh evidence.
On Thursday morning, they said, they were informed after checking with immigration officials that they were in the country illegally.
"I immediately notified the home secretary and my permanent secretary. This is now a matter for immigration enforcement," they wrote.
"Although I complied with the law at all times, I consider that as immigration minister, who is taking legislation through parliament which will toughen up our immigration laws, I should hold myself to a higher standard than expected of others." The prime minister said Harper had "taken an honourable decision" and that they hoped to see them return to the frontbench "before too long".
"I understand your view that, although you carried out checks on your cleaner, you feel that you should hold yourself to an especially high standard as immigration minister," Cameron wrote.
In a limited reshuffle, junior home office minister James Brokenshire has replaced Harper as minister of state, while Karen Bradley moves from the whips office to fill their role.
John Penrose is promoted within the whips office to replace Bradley and Harriet Baldwin is brought into the government ranks as a junior whip.
Home Secretary Theresa May said they were sorry to see Harper go. "Mark has been an excellent minister and they can be proud of the role they have played in sharply reducing immigration to Britain."
We know that Rick and Morty are no strangers to the world of virtual reality, since their game Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality was introduced earlier in the year. But that isn't stopping the series' co-creator, Justin Roiland, from taking even more steps into the medium.
Roiland announced via email that they were pairing up with former Epic Games executive producer Tanya Watson on a new studio called Squanch Games, in the hopes of creating some new virtual reality experiences that stand out from the norm.
In the email, Roiland explains everything in a humorous comic book-style format, introducing a character by the name of Little Splzooshly (not sure how to pronounce that) as they go through VR experiences and introduces members of the team in a smart-ass manner.
“How do you do, fellow kids? I'm Little Splzooshly,” they note in the comic, which you can see below. “Straight up press release right here!”
In the comic, we learn more about Roiland, as “the co-creator of Rick and Morty on Adult Swim. They also do their voices! This guy loves video games! They once punched an old man in a wheelchair! J.K. they never did that. But they sure loves video games. That part is NOT a joke! Now get outta here! Get outta my face! JK!”
They then introduces Tanya Watson, noting, “She straight up is a game veteran, cuz! They were an exec-producer at Epic Games and worked on Gears of War 1, 2 and 3, Bulletstorm and Fortnite. Daaaaamn son! WTF R U KIDDING ME? GTFO!”
The email also includes an address where people can reach out for potential investment and job opportunities, and also points out the debut of the @SquanchGames Twitter account, where fans can see what announces are made, and more. There's also a Squanch Games webpage as well, for those that want to learn more.
We're not sure what the team is working on next (they hinted at possibly revealing something before The Game Awards tomorrow night), but with all the talent involved, we can't wait to see what they have in mind. Plus, let's be honest, Little Splzooshly would make an interesting game hero. (But, really, though, how do we pronounce their name?)
Check out the comic below!
There are sayings among Godville gods that sometimes pets can be even more interesting than the heroes themselves. Therefore, having a pet suddenly die or get replaced could be an unpleasant experience, which is not something that we want. So let's make it better!
First of all, pets will no longer die. From now on, when a pet saves the life of their master, they won't die as they would have before. Instead he'll just be knocked unconscious. The hero can then heal them within 60 hours (same rules as before), but even if they fail to do so, the pet won't be lost. They will come back to their senses on their own, but this time as a more cautious and down-to-earth animal. An animal that doesn't care about levels, pantheon competition, battle nicknames and has no desire to sacrifice their lives, preferring just to simply be with their master.
In other words:
if all you wanted was to see your hero with a friendly companion, you can now forget about the burden of resurrection and just enjoy the game! The pet will stay with their hero forever.
if for some reason you care about pet levels and pantheon position – nothing changes (except the terminology and new UI feature showing the time left for pet healing).
if you want to get rid of a levelless pet, read ahead: once in awhile, your hero will take a quest to bring their companion to a vet for a routine checkup. If you cancel this quest, the hero will set the pet free.
Other news:
for those playing in a web browser – check out the greetings on the top left area of the page. There might be something interesting up there!
the most recent iPhone app update has a shiny new feature that should make influencing more convenient. Make sure to install it.
recent advancements in heroic brain science have finally taught the heroes to turn profit on the old stuff left after an equipment upgrade. It's never too late to make heroes smarter, right?
UPD: There are no changes for pet medals – they are given upon reaching level 30. As with all other achievements, once it's given it can be never taken away.
Btw, we're accepting submissions for new monsters, that can be tamed. Post it right here, in comments (one pre-condition: they must be chosen from the monsters that already in the game).
Many Americans want immigrants to “get in line.” But they cannot do so on their own. They need to get a sponsor, either a U.S. citizen family member or a U.S. employer, to petition the government to grant them permanent residency (a “green card”). Even if immigrants do obtain sponsors, there isn't just one line to get into. Rather, immigrants have separate lines based on the type of sponsorship and their country of origin, and these lines all move at different speeds. Even two immigrants working in essentially the same position whose employer petitions for them on the same day can end up receiving their green cards decades apart if they were born different places.
How America still discriminates based on nationality
This bizarre fact is a consequence of the racist history of U.S. immigration law. In 1921, Congress created the first quota on legal immigration (the “worldwide limit” ). Three years later, it created limits for individual nationalities (the “per-country limits”). The per-country limits give each nationality a share of the worldwide limit. If nationals of a certain country use up their share of the green cards, they have to wait, and immigrants from other countries get to skip ahead of them in line. (And no, Congress made sure that immigrants can't evade the per-country quotas by getting citizenship somewhere else. Birthplace is all that matters.)
Initially, the per-country limits openly discriminated against “undesirable” immigrants, defined as Asians, Africans, and Eastern Europeans (mostly Jews). But in 1965, Congress made the per-country limits uniform across countries. Today, no country can receive more than 7 percent of the worldwide limit in any green card category. But this reform just shifted the discrimination toward nationalities with the highest demand for green cards. The goal here was not any less racist. The debates over the law abounded with “liberals” reassuring conservatives that America wouldn't be flooded with Asians.
In order to apply for a green card, green cards must be available under both the worldwide limit and the per-country limit for the relevant category. After their sponsors petition for them to receive a green card, immigrants wait in line to apply for the green card themselves. The State Department releases a green card bulletin every month to inform immigrants of which ones can apply that month. Immigrants whose sponsor petitioned for them before a certain date—called the “priority date”—can apply. Everyone else must continue to wait.
Right now, for example, Filipinos can apply for a green card this month if their U.S. citizen siblings petitioned for them before June 8, 1994—23 years ago. But here's the critical point: this “priority date” tells Filipinos nothing about how long they will have to wait if their sibling petitioned for them today. If a lot fewer U.S. citizens applied for Filipino siblings after June 8, 1994, they might be able to receive their green cards a decade or sooner than those receiving them today. However, if the number of petitions increased, then the wait could be even longer—maybe decades longer.
For example, the priority date for Filipino siblings of U.S. citizens in June 1994—when those who are today receiving their green cards started the process—was June 1977. In other words, Filipino siblings filing green card applications in June 1994 had waited from 1977 to 1994. The U.S. citizen who filed an immigrant petition on June 8, 1994 may have looked at the green card bulletin and thought their Filipino sibling would have to wait “only” 17 years. In fact, they had to wait 23.
How green card time moves backwards
To know when an immigrant entering the process today will receive a visa, the government would need to know the number of petitions filed in each year under each green card category, the nationality of the beneficiary of each petition, and the nationalities of any spouses and children of the petition beneficiary.
A precise estimate is impossible because some applicants abandon their petitions, apply sometime after their priority date comes up, have additional children, get married, become ineligible, etc. But one would think that the government would attempt to track the basic information carefully, so it could give at least a decent estimate of the future wait times. But being the government, it naturally doesn't, so whenever the State Department moves up the “priority date,” it essentially guesses how many people more will apply. If the State Department guesses wrong, it realizes its mistake and moves the priority date back in time. In other words, green card waiting time doesn't move linearly like real time does. It stops, starts, and even runs in reverse. The government calls movement backward a “retrogression.”
Figure 1 below highlights how priority dates move in the green card backlog for Indian college graduates sponsored by U.S. employers under the employment-based third preference category. When priority dates move ahead in time, the orange line goes up. When they move back in time, it goes down. When the priority date is the same as the current date for multiple months, it goes in a straight line at about a 45-degree angle, progressing steadily upward with each month. As Figure 1 shows, from October 2002 through December 2004, priority dates were current.
Immigrants who were the beneficiary of a green card in December 2004 would have thought, if they had looked only at the priority date, that they would receive their visa almost immediately. In fact, they had to wait more than a decade—until September 2015 to apply. Then, when they finally did apply, the priority immediately retrogressed again. When this happens, the government sets their applications aside until the date becomes current again. Since December 2004, there have been seven significant retrogressions and several other smaller ones.
Figure 1

The big retrogression in 2005—when the priority date moved back to 1998—isn't quite as meaningful as it appears. The State Department moved the dates back that far just to prevent anyone from applying. It's not that the wait really grew quite that much. (If you want to know why the big jump happened, skip to this endnote.[1]) In any case, starting from March 2006—right after the big dip where Figure 1 shows “1-Jan-01”—green card time moved about half as fast as actual time. Priority dates have advanced five years and ten months, while actual time moved forward 11 years in eight months. Figure 2 shows the wait for Indian immigrants to apply more than doubled from 5 years to 11 years, while waits for all other immigrants (excluding China, Philippines, and Mexico) have disappeared.
Figure 2
How Long Applicants Had to Wait to Apply for Green Cards from India and Elsewhere*, October 2002 to November 2017

*Excluding China, Philippines, and Mexico
Wait times are actually longer than Figure 2 shows. Figure 2 only shows the wait to apply, not to receive an approval. As I mentioned before, when the State Department moves the dates forward, and more applicants apply than there are slots available, their applications are held in abeyance until numbers are available again. This post-application waiting period still happens today. In fact, nearly 140,000 immigrants are waiting at this stage in the employment-based categories, and more than a third of them are Indians. It will take several years to clear just these cases from the backlog.
So how long will Indian immigrant workers have to wait going forward? Again, no one really knows for certain. In 2012, Stuart Anderson of the National Foundation for American Policy estimated 70 years. In 2014, the government estimated that 234,000 high skilled workers were waiting to apply for green cards. The family of the workers, however, use up a little more than half of the green card quotas, so there are probably now roughly half a million green card holders in line.
For the two employment-based categories with the longest waits, Indians can only receive 5,600 green cards (out of 80,000). We would need to know what share of those in line are Indian and what share are waiting in which of the employment-based categories to provide a good estimate of the wait for immigrants applying today. This information isn't available. But if even half of these workers are Indians in the EB-3 category—which seems very likely given how much longer Indians in this category have already been waiting than other nationalities—then their wait would be about a century.
In other words, it's possible that almost all of the Indian workers applying today will die before they receive permanent residency, while other immigrant workers will receive their green cards almost right away. This is the system that Congress refuses to reform.
[1] Two factors apparently combined to slam the brakes on Indian workers—and everyone else in the EB-3 green card category—in 2005. First, Congress passed a law at the start of FY 2001 that eliminated the backlog temporarily in 2003 and 2004. The law waived the per-country limits in situations where the worldwide limit for the category otherwise would not be filled, and it temporarily increased the number of green cards by recapturing visas that went unused in 1999 and 2000 (unused visas are a crazy topic for another post).
At the very same time, Congress created a new agency—U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)—to adjudicate green card applications from temporary workers in the United States, and it was developing new procedures to adjudicate applications. Even though the State Department kept telling immigrants that they could apply, USCIS wasn't processing them quickly enough. This led to a growing backlog in green card applications. Once USCIS instituted measures to catch up, the State Department realized that it let far too many applicants apply and slammed on the brakes. These applications are then held in abeyance.
In a world-first, surgeons at Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) have transplanted a 3D printed tibia into a patient.
Reuben Lichter, 27, had the procedure after developing spontaneous onset of tibial osteomyelitis, or an infection of the bone, which resulted in the majority of the tibia being destroyed.
Conventional treatment for Mr Lichter's condition was an above knee amputation.
However, PAH Plastic Surgeon Dr Michael Wagels said they were able to save the leg by inserting a 3D printed model, wrapped in biological tissue in an effort to engineer new bone.
“A multi-disciplinary operating team involving orthopaedics and plastic surgeons took 14 hours to reconstruct Mr Lichter's tibia with a 3D printed model,” Dr Wagels said.
“The procedure involved removing tissue from the bone of the adjacent fibula with its blood supply intact and transferring it into the 3D model to cover approximately half of the model with the elements required to transform it into living bone.
“Additional tissue from the opposite knee was also removed and transplanted. This involved microsurgery to connect the blood vessels of the transplanted tissue the blood supply of the already transferred fibula periosteum. We know from our research that a robust blood supply is a crucial element to the success of the procedure”.
Mr Lichter has been unable to work since September 2016 and recently became a father.
They said they were happy to undergo the unique and experimental procedure if it meant the chance surgeons would not have to amputate their leg.
“Straight away I said yep let's do it, I didn't care that it was experimental, I would do anything to save my leg,” they said.
Mr Lichter said they were hopeful for the long-term outlook of the procedure but had a healthy outlook.
“Even if it doesn't work and they do end up amputating, I've seen the prosthetics people and I've got my mind set that it could happen. I'm well aware and whatever happens, happens at this point,” they said.
“I actually think that I've always had a healthy outlook on it. I was just glad initially that I wasn't in pain anymore. Because once they controlled the infection the pain disappeared and I said whatever happens from here, it's better than living in pain.”
Mr Lichter said their fiancée Caity Bell had been a huge support throughout.
“We actually had a child two days before I was hospitalised, so she's been amazing, a trooper,” they said.
Minister for Health and Ambulance Services Cameron Dick said the opportunities these new kinds of treatments and technologies would open up for Queensland patients were incredibly exciting.
“Which is why we're embracing it with open arms,” they said.

Bob Nanna is a busy man. Not content with just releasing the first Braid album in 16 years this year and a new 7″ with their band Lifted Bells with Mathew from Their/They're/There and others (out this week, streaming below), he'll also be releasing the first new album since 2005 with their solo project, The City on Film. (Not to mention he's recently played solo shows and duo shows with their wife as Jack & Ace.) The new album's called La Vella and it will be out December 16 via Topshelf (pre-order). The premise for the album is they “sourced stories from 9 fans” via their custom songwriting website, Downwrite.com, “and turned them into tracks on this new album.” They recorded it backed by Kyle Geib and Seth Engel, both of whom they play with in Lifted Bells.
The first single, “You Wild Thing (An Illuminous Life),” “tells of a chance meeting and a bonding over The Pogues, Ted Leo, and gym shoes.” While sometimes Bob is in a more stripped down mode for The City on Film, this one sounds like it could have been right off that new Braid record. Good thing he's been so prolific lately because he's clearly got a lot of jams in them right now. That track premieres in this post — check it out, with the artwork and tracklist, below.
The City on Film's only upcoming dates at the moment are The Fest this weekend and two hometowns Chicago shows. Lifted Bells are playing a Fest show too. All TCoF dates are listed below.

So far I am loving this motherboard. This was my first system build in a few years, the last being a Core2Duo machine. I hesitated to spend the extra cash on this fancy motherboard when you can get a decent socket 1150 board for about half the price.
The main things that put me over the top:
- Looks, I'll admit it, I want the inside of the machine to look cool
- Build quality, I want the more serious heatsinks and higher quality memory slot and other connectors that come on a premium board
- The big one: Sound quality.
This board offers the Realtek ALC1150 audio codec chipset. That means higher fidelity (higher dB rate) audio reproduction from your digital sources and more hardware features. It also includes the SoundBlaster software license which gives you some nice tweaking features for things like volume normalization, surround 'expansion' to make a 2 speaker setup or headphones have a more expansive sound, bass enhancement, voice enhancement, etc. It defaults to a nasty overblown default that made everything sound like it was turned up to 11 but after 2 or 3 minutes of fiddling with the soundblaster software I got a nice neutral sound with the added expansion and some minimal volume normalization. No distortion and a very 'rich' sound. I keep noticing how good it sounds compared to my previous computer.
The fit and finish of the board is very, very nice. Take note of the dragon shaped heatsinks and the well fit IO shield for the ports. Everything about this board is nice.
The one thing that frustrated me is the SATA connector layout. All six SATA drive connectors are laid out so they connect parallel on the back edge of the board. In my case, this cause a small issue with the drive cage in my case (Thermaltake LANparty Lite) being a bit too close to the connectors and I had to find some SATA cables with a right angle connector on the end or I would not have been able to connect my hard drives, etc. I would generally prefer SATA connectors on the motherboard to be perpendicular to the surface of the board or a mix of both designs. That's just personal preference though.
DUBAI (Reuters) - Overcrowded hospitals in northwest Iran struggled to cope with thousands of earthquake victims on Sunday as rescuers raced to reach remote villages after two powerful quakes killed nearly 300 people.
Thousands huddled in makeshift camps or slept in the street after Saturday's quakes for fear of more aftershocks, 60 of which had already struck. A lack of tents and other supplies left them exposed to the night chill, one witness told Reuters.
“I saw some people whose entire home was destroyed, and all their livestock killed,” Tahir Sadati, a local photographer, said by telephone. “People need help, they need warm clothes, more tents, blankets and bread.”
The worst damage and most casualties appeared to have been in rural villages around the towns of Ahar, Varzaghan and Harees, near the major city of Tabriz, Iranian media reported.
Tabriz resident Ahmad, 41, told Reuters their cousin living in a village near Ahar was killed and their body found.
“Nobody knows what happened to their wife and two daughters,” aged 4 and 7, Ahmad said. “We fear that if rescuers don't get to them soon, they will lose their lives too if they're still alive.”
But Iranian officials said rescue operations had ended by Sunday afternoon and that all those trapped beneath the rubble had been freed, Iran's English-language Press TV reported.
Many villages are hard to reach by road, hindering rescue efforts. Hospitals in Tabriz, Ardabil and other cities nearby took in many of the injured, residents and Iranian media said, and there were long queues of survivors waiting to be treated.
“I wanted to go there last night to help but heard there was bad traffic and that it wasn't safe enough,” Ahmad said. “People in those villages need help.”
Abbas Falahi, member of parliament for Ahar and Harees, said people in some villages were still “in dire need of food and drinking water”, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
“Despite the promises of officials, little first aide has been distributed in the region and most people are left without tents. If the situation continues, the toll will rise,” they said.
Aidin, a Tabriz resident, said they went to give blood at a local hospital on Saturday and saw staff struggling to cope with the influx of patients. Most patients had been taken there by their families, they said, indicating a shortage of ambulances.
Ahar's 120-bed hospital was full, said Arash, a college student in the town. There were traffic jams on the narrow road to Tabriz as victims tried to reach hospitals, they said by telephone.
VILLAGES DESTROYED
“People are scared and won't go back into their houses because they fear the buildings aren't safe.”
The U.S. Geological Survey measured Saturday's first quake at 6.4 magnitude and said it struck 60 km (37 miles) northeast of the city of Tabriz, a trading hub far from Iran's oil-producing areas and known nuclear facilities.
The second, measuring 6.3, struck 11 minutes later near Varzaghan, 49 km (30 miles) northeast of Tabriz.
More than 1,000 villages in the area were affected by the earthquakes, Ahmad Reza Shaji'i, a Red Crescent official, told the Iranian Students' News Agency (ISNA). Some 130 villages suffered more than 70 percent damage, and 20 villages were completely destroyed, they said.
“We saw some villages that were truly destroyed,” said Sadati, the photographer who was documenting the quake aftermath. “One good thing was that the earthquake happened during the day, so many people were not in their homes. If it had happened at night the casualties would have been far worse.”
Close to 300 people were believed to be dead, said Reza Sadighi, Ahar's local governor, Fars news agency said. National emergency head Gholam Reza Masoumi said 5,000 people are believed to be injured, according to ISNA.
Rescue teams search for victims in the earthquake-stricken village of Varzaghan in East Azarbaijan August 11, 2012. Two powerful earthquakes killed 250 people and injured around 1,800 in northwest Iran, where rescue workers frantically combed the rubble of dozens of villages throughout the night and into Sunday as medical staff desperately tried to save lives.

Nearly 100 ambulances and 1,100 Red Crescent workers were deployed, Shaji'i said, along with 44,000 food packages and 5,600 tents for shelter. The relief agency had enough supplies and most residents in the area had access to clean water but Shaji'i asked residents to donate cash to the relief effort.
Tehran officials sent condolences to the victims and declared two days of mourning in the province, ISNA reported.
About 36,000 people in the quake-hit area have been given emergency shelter, Masoumi was quoted as saying by ISNA.
Iranian lawmaker Mohammad Hassan-Nejad warned that if relief efforts did not speed up, the death toll would swiftly rise.
“Relief groups have still not reached many villages, because in normal conditions some of these villages are several hours away,” they told ISNA. “Currently the roads are closed and the only way to reach these villages is by air.”
COLLAPSED BUILDINGS
Photographs posted on Iranian news websites showed numerous bodies, including children, lying on the floor of a white-tiled morgue in Ahar and medical staff treating the injured in the open air as dusk fell on Saturday. Other images showed rescue workers digging people out of rubble - some alive, many dead.
Twenty-eight year old Narges in Tehran said they saw dozens of people in a hospital waiting to donate blood for the victims.
Iran is crisscrossed by major fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 magnitude quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed about 31,000 people.
Saturday's quakes struck in East Azerbaijan province, a mountainous region that neighbors Azerbaijan and Armenia to the north. Buildings in Tabriz, the provincial capital, are substantially built and ISNA reported nobody in the city had been killed or hurt.
Homes and business premises in Iranian villages, however, are often made of concrete blocks or mud brick that can crumble and collapse in a strong quake.

Water, electricity, and phone lines in the area of Varzaghan are all down, further hindering rescue efforts, Iran's English-language Press TV reported.
Tabriz residents left their homes and crowded the streets following the two quakes, those in the city said. “Everyone was scared last night,” a resident said by telephone. “They set up tents and were sleeping in the streets and in parks.”

1. The current format for Most Valuable Player already suggests that a team's overall success isn't everything. It's baked right into the voting. If team wins were so incredibly important to ferreting out just how valuable an individual player can be, the voting would be held after the postseason.
Was there any player more valuable than Andrew Miller in 2016? Probably, but you can at least see how the argument would have shifted two weeks ago. We've already accepted that line of thinking as absurd in an MVP debate. Why should Miller have benefited from the extra exposure, the extra time to build their case?
Why should Miller have benefited from being on one of the teams that performed best in the postseason?
Giving credit to Miller for the extra month would have been indirectly crediting Miller for being teammates with Corey Kluber, which would go against the idea of Most Valuable Player, singular. If we're sussing out an individual contribution, we have to ignore the teams that succeed in the postseason, and we do, and we've done it for years. No one wants to vote held after the World Series.
It would weight team success far too much, which would distort the idea of giving an individual award for individual accomplishments.
Which is what we've been yelling about all along, you goobers. Now we have validation, and it took one of the best players in history to get it.
2. Oh, how the people who invented this silly award messed up. Never underestimate the ability of people to insert ambiguity where none exists. The Cy Young award goes to the best pitcher. Best. No ambiguity. And every year, while voters still manage to mess certain things up, there's no argle bargle about which pitcher was worth more because they were on a contending team. There's just honest disagreement about which baseball players chuck baseballs the best. It's refreshing.
Someone just had to put the word into the MVP, though. Valuable. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa reigniting interest in baseball was more valuable to the Dodgers than Clayton Kershaw ever could be. The comforting warmth of your childhood pet when you were home with the chicken pox is more valuable than all the money that Mike Trout will ever make. This single glass of Four Roses that is actively making me forget about the world right now is worth more than a $20 bill that you promise to give me in two weeks.
Is all of that true? Dunno. But if you give me another glass of that there brown stuff, I'll stay on the internet and argue about it with you.
I'm not sure when someone decided that only contending teams could have valuable players, and I'm not sure how the virus spread. But it was a silly parsing of a word that didn't need to be in there. We should be arguing about the BPP (Best Position Player) award.
3. That would keep away the pitchers-don't-count weirdos, too.
4. It's not just contending teams that have valuable players, and that idea is disrespectful to a majority of baseball fans every year. It's absurd, this idea that the players you watch for three hours every night, the ones who keep you watching, aren't valuable unless the bozos around them are valuable too.
Mike Trout would be more valuable if Adrian Beltre and Yu Darvish were on their team.
Mike Trout would be more valuable if the Angels had a $300 million payroll.
Mike Trout would be more valuable if the Angels had a better draft in 2012 and 2013.
Say the sentences out loud for full effect. They're all non-sequiturs, idea fragments from a notebook that Lewis Carroll threw away. How does the value change? What sort of point are you trying to prove?
5. Trout won the MVP, and I promise you that none of this was pre-written. I'm not trying to salvage something I write out of outrage. It's just that this feels like the last time I'll get to point all this out. It's the Death of the “Valuable” Debate, and we're all here to witness it. What an important time.
6. Ha ha, just kidding. It's not important. And I'm also kidding about it being the end of the debate. It took someone as good as Mike Trout to spin the conventional wisdom around. All we need, then, is someone as good as them every year.
Yep. It's just that simple.
7. Except there is no one as good as Mike Trout, and I'm not sure if there will be for another 50 years.
If seems like this is something we take for granted, that's because it is. Let's just check in with the top 20 players in Angels history according to Baseball-Reference.com.
There they are, second from the top left, grinning like they know the secret to baseball, which they do. Chuck Finley played 14 years for the Angels, making five All-Star Games, starting 379 games, and throwing 2,675 innings.
“Just two of those innings were in the postseason, though, so they couldn't have been too valuable,” is something you didn't think just now. But we're off track.
Trout has almost caught up to him.
Trout turned 25 in August.
Tyler Naquin, who finished third in Rookie of the Year voting, turned 25 in April. Gary Sanchez will turn 25 next December.
If Trout won Rookie of the Year this season, no one would have remarked how old they were for the award. They would have fit in just fine. Because they could pass for a rookie just fine.
Instead, he's already accumulated more career value than Jim Rice and Lou Brock if WAR is to be believed.
8. There's that word again. Value. Well, now, let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means.
PERSON IN DOCKERS, LISTENING TO “THE RIVER”: Well, it means that a player is ...
I know what you think it means, buddy. To me, it's just a made-up word. A writer's word, so that older fellas like yourself can pound a keyboard and wear Dockers and have a job. What do you really want to know? Is Mike Trout good at what they do? There's not a day goes by where ...
9. Right now, there's a kid swinging a bat in their Anaheim backyard, even though the November cold front has arrived and it's 70 degrees, but that's OK, they or they can bundle up. That kid is swinging a bat because of Mike Trout. Maybe there's no way to directly prove it, no way to make a one-to-one correlation possible, but take it from me, a kid whose parents had season tickets to the 1984 and 1985 Giants, you notice when the other teams have the best players. I ended up loving the sport anyway, but I'll wonder how many other kids my age would have been baseball nerds if Dwight Gooden were on the Giants.
I can't fathom how capturing the imagination of everyone who watches them isn't just as valuable in people's minds as a team chasing the second wild card.
It's not just the kid in their or their backyard, either. It's the grown ups who make the conscious decision with how to spend their free time. Three hours out of 24 is a huge chunk out of an adult's life, and there's absolutely a difference between spending it with a losing team filled with a bunch of losers and spending it with a losing team that just happens to have one of the greatest baseball players to walk the planet.
You might even say a player who can make a team more watchable, even in the bad years, is providing that team with substantial value.
Or you could just note that Trout helps their team win more baseball games than any other player helps their team win baseball games, and they did it again in 2016. That's another way to define it. It's also true.
10. Trout is the most valuable player in the American League, just as he's been every year since they played their first full season in 2012. There isn't a logical definition of “most valuable” that excludes him, and the voters are finally realizing it. Perhaps the most impressive part is that the vote wasn't that close. It wasn't a landslide, but 19 voters out of 30 agreed that they were the most valuable. That's progress.
Just two voters thought they aren't one of the two most valuable players in the AL. Mookie Betts really was close this year, you know, so I can almost see using the part about contending teams as a tiebreaker. It becomes less of a non-sequitur, at least. That's also progress.
What we know is that there wasn't an odd parsing of the word “valuable” this year, and the award is better for it. The point of baseball is to win games. Winning correlates with entertainment, being entertained correlates with being more willing to part with your money, teams who receive more money correlate with teams spending more money, teams spending more money correlate with teams that win. This is all sort of abstract, but bear with me.
Or you could just restate the obvious, one last time: Mike Trout helped their team win more than any other player helped their team win. Therefore, they were the most valuable player. Also, they were the Most Valuable Player. Even if this should have been for the fifth time, we'll settle for progress and a job well done. It was a lot of fun to watch, as it always is.
The Dutch population is increasingly staying away from milk. A massive 21 million fewer liter cartons of milk was sold in 2014, compared to 2013. In the past 15 years, the amount of milk consumed in the Netherlands dropped by more than a third, RTL Nieuws reports.
According to the Nutrition Center, this massive decrease can mainly be attributed to the popularity books that state that ordinary milk is unhealthy. It could also have to do with the trending norm that plain m ilk is old-fashioned and boring.
The Nutrition Center advises those who are staying away from milk to make sure that they still ingest plenty of other dairy products. Dairy is the main source of calcium in the Netherlands, and is very important for strong bones.
Since the European milk quota was lifted in April, milk production has increased in the country, despite the falling demand. The industry is not overly concerned, however. Only 8 percent of the milk produced actually goes into milk cartons. The remainder is used to make other dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.
A large portion of Dutch milk is also exported to other countries. The worldwide demand for milk increased by 3 percent this past year.

Big Egg Hunt Hides 200 Giant Easter Eggs In London
From tomorrow until late March, London will be home to the biggest Easter Egg hunt in history. 200 fibreglass ova will be secreted around the capital, each one decorated by a well-known artisan. If you're the sort of person who gets annoyed by eggstremely weak egg-based puns, it might be eggspedient to leave town now (scramble, if you will).
Big names decorating the eggs include the Chapman Brothers, Marc Quinn, Zaha Hadid, Zandra Rhodes, Vivienne Westwood, Sir Peter Blake, Sir Ridley Scott and, inevitably, food frolickers Bompas & Parr.
Following the month-long eggshibition, the shelly baubles will be auctioned for charities Action for Children and Elephant Family. The egg hunt is reminiscent of 2010's Elephant Parade, Cow Parade a decade ago, and the upcoming BT ArtBox in which London will be bekiosked with painted phone boxes.
The project will launch tomorrow in Trafalgar Square at 7.30am. A map and app will then be available to help you track down the eggs, each of which will contain a special code that could help you win a £100,000 Fabergé egg.
Follow-on Facebook, where you can find further photos of the furtive funballs. Given the number of statues that have gone missing lately, we hope none of these eggs get poached.

Don Verdean is a man of faith who has devoted their life to biblical archaeology, scouring the globe in search of artifacts that back up the teachings of Jesus Christ. Now, traveling from town to town, they and their devoted assistant, Carol, spread the gospel by peddling books and DVDs out of their shabby RV, while their Holy Land contacts, Boaz and Shem, do the digging from afar. When evangelical preacher Tony Lazarus offers to bankroll Don's modest roadside operation, the escalating pressure to find increasingly significant relics leads Don and their team down a less-than-righteous path. With more than just the word of God on the line, Don finds themselves in the midst of a spiteful feud between two opposing congregations, leaving them to question what is truly important in life.
With a fantastic ensemble cast in tow, director Jared Hess returns to the Sundance Film Festival with this hilarious and biting satire that explores the thin line between faith and fabrication. —A.M.

Though it moves in straight lines on a regular schedule, urban road traffic is a textbook chaotic system, in which seemingly minor causes can have colossal knock-on effects on gridlock.
Annoyingly, many of them seem to cluster in September.
In Washington, D.C., for example, the average commute jumps by five minutes from August to September, even though the number of cars on the road stays the same.
The reason, city planners believe, is that in August, commuters drive at rush hour according to their own schedules, a little bit early one day, a bit late the next. But in September, those with children to drop at school suddenly have a firm time to leave, causing cars to cluster, creating the inevitable traffic jams.
This “back to school jump” is one of many seemingly inconsequential factors — like unfinished summer roadworks or a reluctance to take sick days so soon after summer vacation — that seem to have a cumulative effect of making September an awful month for driving, as drivers across Canada can probably attest to at this point.
If 5 p.m. is rush hour, September feels a lot like rush month, the annual moment of peak gridlock.
I think part of it probably is related to everybody back from vacation, everybody's on routine schedules
Some of this spike is likely in the eye of the beholder. Every traffic jam seems like the worst ever until the next, especially if holiday memories remain fresh.
But there is a science beneath the anecdotal complaints, and surveys of traffic patterns in places as diverse as Holland, China, America and Canada show that if September is not the worst, it is at least tied with April.
“My guess is that the surge of traffic that you see in September in part is observation bias,” said Morris Flynn, associate professor in mechanical engineering at the University of Alberta, who has studied the dynamics of traffic flow using the principles of fluid dynamics.
“I think part of it probably is related to everybody back from vacation, everybody's on routine schedules, people aren't taking sick days, everybody thinks that they have to get to work at 7:55, they don't realize that they can blow in at 8:05 and nobody really notices,” they said.
They have done research on “phantom traffic jams,” when a uniform stream of traffic mysteriously clogs up in a spontaneous spike of density, as opposed to a real traffic jam caused by a fixed obstacle like a pile-up or construction site. They learned that when roads exceed their capacity, traffic becomes “a self-reinforcing system” in which “everything just gets progressively more and more bogged down.”
“If you have this over-capacity of people on the roadways, and everybody on September the first feels locked into this rigid schedule, you're going to get all kinds of manifestations of an over-capacity of people on the roadway, and that includes things like phantom jams, but as soon as phantom jams happen, then the likelihood of an accident goes up, and then you have a real traffic jam.”
The reason those odds increase, they said, is the relative difficulty of stop-and-start driving as compared to driving at a uniform speed.
Anecdotally, they said their wife is a teacher who is reluctant to take sick days so soon after vacation, but as with many jobs, if they call in sick someone else has to replace her, for no net reduction in cars on the road.
Traffic's hourly and daily patterns are more familiar and usually more obvious than the seasonal ones. As a Dutch team found, “in general, a daily pattern consists of two rush hour peaks, an off-peak period, an evening period and a night period.”
Weekly, Friday shows a consistent drop of 5-10% during peak hours, they found. Monday has a low off peak period, possibly because most people are at work, but Friday has a high one, possibly indicating an early start to the weekend.
In the past we did not understand the mechanics of behaviour so we didn't know how to manage data
Seasonally, the Dutch research showed two peaks over the course of a year, the first in spring, when the peak lasted several weeks, and then again for a shorter time toward the end of September.
Solving this, if it is solvable, requires a sensitivity to not only the brute demands of highway infrastructure, but also the vagaries of the “human factors.”
Some solutions are admirably simple. Both Ottawa and Toronto have experimented with staggered start times for major employers, which spreads out rush hour, and has a measurable (though minor) effect.
Others are bafflingly complex. Yi-Chang Chiu, a traffic engineer at the University of Arizona, is working on a new model for traffic forecasting to replace the 50-year-old one currently in use. Known as VASTO, for Evolutionary Agent System for Transportation Outlook, it aims to simulate the behaviour of actual people, who do not simply drive from origin to destination, but rather change their routes on the fly, stop for a coffee, or circle around the block for cheap parking.
“Most cities keep on building to meet peak congestion hours,” Prof. Chiu said in a report on the project. “In the past we did not understand the mechanics of behaviour so we didn't know how to manage data.”
Usually, though, the solution is just to build more and bigger roads, which might not be ideal.
Anthony Downs, an economist whose 1992 book Stuck in Traffic was especially influential on Vancouver's traffic system, called traffic congestion “an essential ingredient in making effective use of the nation's road systems during peak travel hours. In effect, congestion is not the problem; rather it is the solution to the real problem, which is, how can we ration our limited road space during peak hours.”
They also took a fatalist view of the urge to increase road capacity to an imagined sweet spot. Traffic, as they see it, absorbs all available capacity.
As such, it is an indicator of economic health, a pain in the neck, but better than the alternative.
As Mr. Downs put it nearly 25 years ago on a visit to Toronto, which rivals Vancouver for the country's worst traffic: “You people here in Toronto are experiencing some of the fruits of your immense success.”

A Sauk Village nail salon allegedly burned a man so badly during a pedicure their leg was later amputated and their injuries caused or contributed to their death, according to court records.
According to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in Cook County court Thursday by the man's wife, Darryl Carr went to AZ Happy Nails for a pedicure in November 2013. Their feet were soaked in a hot water and chemical solution, followed by a hot wax solution, the lawsuit states.
The suit alleges AZ Happy Nails was careless or negligent in using contaminated or unsafe chemical and wax solutions, soaking Carr's foot in the solutions too long, using excessive heat on Carr's left foot and failing to test whether Carr might suffer an allergic reaction or ask whether they had any medical conditions.
They also failed to warn Carr about the risk of harm and failed to properly train and supervise its employees, the suit claims.
"As the proximate result … (Carr) suffered injuries of a personal and pecuniary nature, including serious burns to their left foot and leg, which subsequently became infected, resulting in the amputation of their left foot and leg, and other medical complications that ultimately caused or contributed to their death on June 4, 2015," the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit also names A-Z Nail Spa, Inc., Wen Hua Cong and Xiao Xian Wang. During a call to AZ Happy Nails, a person answering the phone said the salon's owners or manager were not available to comment Friday evening.
Carr's wife is seeking more than $50,000 in damages, according to the complaint.
DOT Mobility Report highlights NYC's bus problem By Benjamin Kabak By· Published in 2016
Every day, the 8.5 million people who live in New York, along with numerous tourists and others journeying in for work or education or fun, have to get somewhere. We have to get to our jobs and our schools, our grocery stores and our parks, and our museums, plays and baseball stadiums. We take subways and buses, cars and taxis, bikes and boats. On some days, our riders are smoother than others, but by and large this transportation network gets us where we need to be.
It's not, however, all perfect, and lately cracks in a particularly vital segment have been on full display. New York City's bus network seems to be hemorrhaging riders at a study clip, and although policy-makers have expressed concern over sharply declining ridership figures, they have not yet taken steps to solve New York City's bus problems. A solution could require a major reconfiguring of how we prioritize traffic and street space, and current City and MTA officials haven't been willing to dig in for a fight.
Earlier this week, NYC DOT released a new Mobility Report [pdf], and the colorful document highlights how New York City is more crowded than ever before and traffic speeds, especially in Manhattan's so-called central business district south of 60th Street, have never been slower. “With record tourism, jobs and population growth, New York City is now experiencing packed subway trains, along with a 300% surge in daily bicycling since 1990,” DOT Commissioner Polly Trottenberg noted in a statement. “The report's conclusions are clear: As we move forward, policymakers will need to redouble efforts to chart a course that supports mass transit and other options to keep a growing and thriving New York City moving.”
If only it were that simple. As the population grows, mobility has slowed, and buses have been the biggest victims of slow speeds. The numbers are stark. In 2000, annual bus ridership hit 699 million, and that number held steady until 2010 when the MTA slashed numerous bus routes and generally reduced service throughout the city. Since then, and despite a rollback of some of the cuts, annual ridership hit 651 million last year, and there is no indication this trend will reverse.
The report discusses the rise of cycling as a popular means of filling in holes in the transit network and solving many people's last-mile problems, but it seems to lay the blame of the bus decline squarely on the shoulders of speed. Using BusTime data, DOT found that travel speeds in Manhattan, where ridership has sunk the most, are slowest, and in many spots, buses are traveling slower than a healthy adult can walk. For example, a westbound M42 averages 3.2 miles per hour between 2nd Avenue and 6th Avenue between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on a weekday. For many people, it is literally faster to walk.
That bus speeds are so slow is no big surprise, but what can we do to fix it? The report indicates that speeds are the cause for a decline, but it falls short of identifying any cures. Generally, three issues create slow buses. First, the boarding process where riders dip their MetroCards (and often struggle with it) is slow and clunky, creating very long dwell times at stations. Second, buses are subject to the whims of the street. Without dedicated infrastructure, buses get stuck in traffic, and even in places where dedicated lanes do exist, enforcement is spotty. Queue-jumping technology, or signal priortization, was supposed to be a part of the city's Select Bus Service offerings, but it still hasn't been rolled out. Add it all up, and you get slow buses.
From where I sit, fixing the buses would involve a massive philosophical change in which pre-board fare payment is the norm rather than a feature of a souped-up express bus. It would involve rethinking the bus network to ensure that buses provide connections between where riders are and where they want to be. It would also require a major push to bring dedicated bus lanes to far more areas of the city. Buses shouldn't be a secondary mode of transit, subject to congestion; buses should get priority over surface congestion.
Ultimately, if the city is serious about eliminating congestion, especially in Manhattan, the answer will be some form of pricing model, but that will lead to the need to invest in buses. And to do that, the city has to start respecting buses. Otherwise, they will be forever stuck in traffic, inching slowly down their routes, sometimes faster than walking, usually slower than biking, and always a second-class mode of transit.
Three weeks from tomorrow the first day of the NFL draft will kick off in Philadelphia and 32 teams will scramble to find the next generation of great football talent.
The Atlanta Falcons are expected to use one of their picks on a prospect that can fill the void left by the retirement of right guard Chris Chester. Most mock drafts predict Atlanta will either select Indiana's Dan Feeney or Western Kentucky's Forrest Lamp in either the first or second round.
Feeney and Lamp are hot commodities though and there's a chance neither will be available when the Falcons are on the clock.
In that scenario, Atlanta might look out west to one of three Utah offensive line prospects.
According to a report by Tony Pauline at Draft Analyst, the Falcons were in Salt Lake City last week to work out the three Utes:
“Franchises have sent units comprising of general managers, head coaches and offensive line coaches to Salt Lake City to specifically work out the Utes offensive linemen, three who project as top-100 picks. The Atlanta Falcons were in town last week to work out the trio, and on Tuesday the Tampa Bay Bucs were on campus to put all three through a workout.”
Who are these three linemen?
J.J. Dielman (6-foot-5, 309 pounds) played tackle in college and is projected to go in the fourth round.
Sam Tevi (6-foot-5, 311 pounds) also played tackle and is expected to be picked in the fifth. They have been getting a lot of pre-draft interest from the Carolina Panthers.
Dielman and Tevi may move inside depending on which team picks them but it's possible the Falcons could use one as a swing tackle to backup Jake Matthews and Ryan Schraeder.
Isaac Asiata (6-foot-3, 323 pounds) is the only pure guard of the bunch and the most promising. They may be selected late in the second round or early in the third. Their size will effectively disqualify them from playing tackle in the NFL, so if Atlanta is interested he's likely their man at right guard.
OK now you can continue!
Basically, get your Pi zero to a point you can log in. Power it from the Power USB port, leave the Data USB port 'empty'
While you don't need a console cable, it's a lot easier to copy & paste the commands into a terminal than to type into a keyboard + monitor.
This tutorial isn't terribly difficult but you should have some raspberry Pi experience. In particular you will want to do the following before anything else
Yeah the gadget system can do a lot more, but these are the two modules we've tested so far. The compiled kernel package has just about every USB gadget compiled in as a module if you'd like to try others
As of May 2016, Raspbian Jessie has built in kernel support - this tutorial is way easier!
This tutorial is basically just a writeup of how you can follow along and turn your Pi zero into a USB Serial device or Ethernet device. That's two whole ways of being able to connect to your Pi zero just by plugging in a micro B cable! You don't even need to power your Pi seperately, as power is provided from your computer.
Some awesome people on github sorted out that if you used the DWC2 USB driver, and patched a few files, you could get the Pi to act like a USB device (in linux-land this is called the USB Gadget system)
Basically, the Pi sorta-trying to become a usb device rather than a usb host
When the Pi Zero came out, one of the downsides (!) of the low-cost design was swapping the 'standard' USB A-port for a micro-B port. Now you have to use an 'OTG' cable instead of just plugging in a device.
You may have to hit return a few times to get it to come up with the login prompt. But that's it! You're now connected to your Pi Zero directly
You can also remove the power cable to the 'power USB' port, since the desktop computer will be powering the Pi thru the USB gadget port.
you can disconnect the console cable, so you dont mix up the USB console cable and the direct-console connection (since they both have COM/Serial ports)
OK now that your Pi is rebooted and you get that USB serial device again, you can connect to it at 115200 baud (8N1 8-bit No-parity 1-stop if you need to set that)
On Mac, it will be a new device called /dev/tty.usbmodemNNNN where NNNN can be any number
On your computer you'll see a new Serial port is created. Check the Windows device driver:
While the Zero is rebooting you can see that it loads the g_cdc module which provides "CDC USB Serial support" ( CDC stands for 'communications device class' )
Don't forget to plug in the USB cable from your computer to the "USB" connector port on the Pi Zero, not the PWR connector.
Thats...pretty much it. run sudo reboot to start up your Pi Zero. Plug in a USB Micro cable from your computer to the Pi Zero.
You can then verify its running with
(don't forget the sudo like i did at first!)
OK just cuz you have a Serial port doesn't mean you can log in with it yet. The Pi knows it has a Serial port but you have to tie it to a console. You can do that very easily with:
While booting, or later when runing sudo dmesg you can see that it bound driver g_serial
Insert the SD into your Pi Zero, connect the console cable, power the Pi & log into via the USB console.
At the time of writing, this is the full cmdline.txt contents (in case you need to start over). Note it is one very long line
Save the config.txt file as plain text and then open up cmdline.txt After rootwait (the last word on the first line) add a space and then modules-load=dwc2,g_serial
Go to the bottom and add dtoverlay=dwc2 as the last line:
After burning the SD card, do not eject it from your computer! Use a text editor to open up the config.txt file that is in the SD card post-burn.
We're using Jessie Lite but plain Jessie Raspbian should work too! You need May 2016 or later (tested with 2016-05-27)
We'll start with Serial Gadget, which is the 'simplest' of the USB gadgets. This one basically makes it so when you plug in the Pi Zero to your computer, it will pop up as a Serial (COM) Port - the nice thing about this technique is you can use the pi with any computer and operating system and it doesnt require special drivers or configuration.
The Ethernet Gadget is a little more difficult to set up, but is a lot more powerful because you can tunnel networking, VNC, ssh and scp files, etc. Basically you get the ability to log in to the console as well as anything else you could want to do over a network connection Note that even though it's called "Ethernet Gadget" you do not use an Ethernet cable! The only cable is the USB micro-B cable from your computer to your Pi Zero. The Pi 'appears' like an Ethernet device. You can even share your desktop computer's network setup so your Pi can access the internet through your computer via the USB cable! Cool huh? Thx for the tips from Andrew, as of May 2016, Raspbian Jessie does not require a new kernel & has raspberrypi.local setup by default so it's a lot easier
Step 0. Download and install the latest Jessie We're using Jessie Lite but plain Jessie Raspbian should work too! We're using Jessie Lite but plain Jessie Raspbian should work too! You need May 2016 or later (tested with 2016-05-27) This tutorial has the details
Step 1. Edit config.txt & cmdline.txt After burning the SD card, do not eject it from your computer! Use a text editor to open up the config.txt file that is in the SD card post-burn. Go to the bottom and add dtoverlay=dwc2 as the last line:
Save the config.txt file as plain text and then open up cmdline.txt After rootwait (the last word on the first line) add a space and then modules-load=dwc2,g_ether
Boot Your Pi with USB Plug in a MicroUSB cable from your Pi Zero's USB port to your computer
Don't forget to plug in the USB cable from your computer to the "USB" connector port on the Pi Zero, not the PWR connector.
If you have a console cable you can watch the Zero's console to see it enable the g_ether device:
Advanced Networking (Fixed IP) If you need to manage fixed IP addresses for some reason - here are some useful techniques for managing your Pi's Gadget Ethernet device. Otherwise, you can always just keep using raspberrypi.local You can now log in and check that you have a new network device called usb0 sudo ifconfig -a
Try plugging the Pi Zero into your computer now. For example, on a Mac, we plugged it in
As you can see above, between the first ifconfig and second, the network came up with an address. The problem this is a arbitrary (Bonjour/Zero Conf assigned) address, and we dont want to have to guess it. We can configure this device to have a fixed address (this makes it easier to find on a network!) sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
and add at the end
Download: Copy Code Download: file allow-hotplug usb0 iface usb0 inet static address 192.168.7.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 192.168.7.0 broadcast 192.168.7.255 gateway 192.168.7.1 allow-hotplug usb0 iface usb0 inet static address 192.168.7.2 netmask 255.255.255.0 network 192.168.7.0 broadcast 192.168.7.255 gateway 192.168.7.1
This will give the Raspberry Pi the IP Address 192.168.7.2 you can change this to a different address but unless you're sure that 192.168.7.* is unavailable, keep it as above for now.
Save the file and run sudo ifdown usb0 (this may fail, its fine)
(this may fail, its fine) sudo ifup usb0
ifconfig usb0 to verify it now has the 192.168.7.2 address
Now on your computer you'll need to set it up as well. If you are using a Mac as the Host Computer On a Mac OS X machine, open up the System Preferences -> Network box.
You'll see the device show up as an RNDIS/Ethernet Gadget. it'll probably be set up for DHCP by default so change it to Configure IP4 Manually For the IP address pick 192.168.7.1 (note that this is not the same as the Pi Zero's address!)
(note that this is not the same as the Pi Zero's address!) For the subnet mask, use 255.255.255.0 (same as Pi)
(same as Pi) For the router/gateway use 192.168.7.1 (same as Pi) If you didnt use our suggested netconfig above on the Pi, you may have to adjust this one to match
Click Apply when done, and wait a minute or so you will get a green dot:
If you're still having issues, a reader reported some Mac's need a special option on the g_ether device. While logged into your Pi with a console cable, run sudo nano/etc/modprobe.d/g_ether.conf
and add: options g_ether use_eem=0 on it's own line, at the end. After a reboot or manual load of the module, the the RNDIS/CNC gadget will turn yellow then green after assigning an IP.
You can use a terminal on the computer to check the IP address was set, your device will be called enX where X is some number, use ifconfig -a to see a list of all devices, chances are the Pi is the last one. Once you can see that the IP address is set, try pinging the pi with ping 192.168.7.2
To be honest, I rebooted the Pi after setting up the network config file, so if it doesnt work at first, try that.
Next up you can ssh into your pi from your Mac! ssh [email protected]
If you are using Windows as the Host Machine Plug in the Pi Zero into your computer, I'm using Windows 7 64-bit. It will automatically download and install the RNDIS Ethernet drivers
Some versions of windows may mis-interpret the PI as a COM port and you must manually force or install Microsoft RNDIS driver usage in Device Manager by right-click>Update Driver Software>Browse my computer>Pick from a list>Network Adapters>Microsoft>Remote NDIS compatible device. Check the Device Manager to check that it is a new network adapter
Open up Network and Sharing Center and click on Change Adapter Settings
You'll see a list of all the myriad adapters you have. I have a lot but you'll likely only have 2 or 3. Find the RNDIS adapter and rename it pizero (makes it easier to find)
Then right-click and select Properties...
And select the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) from the connection list and click Properties
Enter in 192.168.7.1 as the computer's IP address and gateway (the gateway got erased later, I think Windows just automatically uses the IP address if they're the same) the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 same as the Pi's There's no DNS address
I unplugged & replugged in the Pi Zero, Windows will then identify the network.
Now you can use a command box to run ipconfig /all if you want to check out the stats on the connection
and ping 192.168.7.2 (the pi)

NSW First Fox Rescue Set to Fight Cruel Legislation
On Friday the 19th of August at 6pm, Sydney Fox Rescue will be holding a campaign launch for their fight against the Pest Control Order (PCO) for Red Foxes 2014.
This campaign launch is the accumulation of 18 months' worth of tireless work on the behalf of the maligned European Red Fox. Under the Local Land Services Act, The Minister for Primary Industries has rendered the rescue and rehoming of red foxes illegal (PCO Red Foxes 2014). Sydney Fox Rescue objects to this decision on the basis of extreme animal welfare concerns and is urging the public to support them in advocating for policy change on this issue.
What the PCO means for Red European Foxes:
- Rescuing foxes is now illegal
- Rehoming foxes is now illegal
- Foxes in need are unable to legal access vet care
- Transporting foxes (even for veterinary care) is illegal
- All foxes who are orphaned and injured are now meant to be euthanized
For the past 18 months since the PCO was declared, SFR have worked long and hard to negotiate a viable permit system for our rescue foxes and the foxes we have rehomed, and continue our fight for these maligned animals.
However, despite our best efforts in negotiations between our organization and the Local Land Services, they have refused to issue permits for foxes rescued after March 2015 or to allow the continued work of Sydney Fox Rescue. They fear that our rescue group is “changing the culture of foxes in New South Wales” and may pose a threat to the continued government use of the inhumane 1080 bait.
Our busiest rescue period is just weeks away, with fox kit season meaning that hundreds of orphans will soon be in need of our help. For this reason we are now turning to a public campaign to lobby for the PCO on European Red Foxes to be overturned. The campaign will feature in online, social and print media, and will focus on the stories of particular rescue foxes in our care as well as the possible fates of orphans in 2016 under the PCO.
The campaign website can be found at runningoutoftime.com.au. We will also launch online on our Facebook page at facebook.com/sydneyfoxrescue.
But we know that taking on the Local Land Services as well as the Minister for Primary Industries isn't going to be easy, and we need your help. SFR are looking for the public backing and support of other animal welfare organizations, as well as politicians, celebrities and businesses.

OK so I have a funny story, I met some college girls at the gym this morning. And after talking we began to work out together. One of the girls asked me what I did. I told them that I was a poet, and an author.She said oh cool, so I bet you can't wait to get a guide dog, because then it will make you more independent when you are writing, you won't have to ask anyone to write for you, because the dog can tell you whether or not you are staying in between the lines.
I looked at them with my serious face, and I proceeded to say. Yes and you know what else is cool guy dogs come with programmable voices, I want my dog to have a British accent. They said yes British accents are pretty cool. I don't think they were understanding.
I said to her, you know that dogs can't talk right? At this point their friends are dying laughing, full on almost in tears.
They said well I don't know, I thought the government made guide dogs for the blind by genetically modify their jeans with human genes in order to make them smarter, I mean how else can they tell you where you are going when you are walking
Ed this point I really thought they were joking, so I said no they implant a chip inside of my brain, and it allows me to see through my Guide dogs eyes.
They said oh wow that sounds practical, I should have thought of that first. I can see how that could be better, plus women wouldn't know if you were looking up their skirts. Being a blind person sounds fun
The funny thing about this whole interaction, they were deadly serious, I think I'm just going to let them go on thinking that. Every time they meet another blind person, and they have a guy dog, they will make sure the guy dog doesn't walk too close to them
Kevin Trapp is a man in demand.
Eintracht Frankfurt's coach Armin Veh wants the future of goalkeeper Kevin Trapp decided quickly after they were linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain.
Trapp, 24, has been linked with a move to the French champions with Eintracht wanting a transfer fee of around €10 million for the German. However, Veh is not prepared to disrupt their preparations for the new season with a training camp in Austria starting on Saturday.
"We will not wait forever," Veh told Frankfurter Rundschau. "There will be a decision in the upcoming days one way or the other. No decision has been made yet. So I have nothing to proclaim. I can't blame him, if they want to take that chance. Paris Saint-Germain is among Europe's top clubs."
Veh does not want to lose Trapp, but admitted that they could be persuaded to part with the goalkeeper.
"On the one hand we would lose a good goalkeeper but on the other hand we would get a lot of money by our standards," they added. "Trapp has become a better goalkeeper at Frankfurt. But their development is not yet finished, also on a personal level."
Eintracht have already signed 24-year-old Austrian international Heinz Lindner from Austria Wien, but will target another keeper should Trapp leave the club and Veh said: "We have a theoretical plan B in our heads but we have not spoken to any goalkeepers yet."

A debut piece by William May takes an interesting look at the form of Liverpool players over the last 20 games – using player ratings and statistics to rank the best and worst performers.
After a shaky start to the season, Liverpool have experienced something of a revival in recent weeks.
The Reds have won 8, drawn 7 and lost just 1 of their last sixteen games in all competitions, with Brendan Rodgers' adoption of a 3-4-2-1 formation key to this recent success.
The two games in which the new system has impressed against superior opposition were the draws against Arsenal and Chelsea – in both games Liverpool completely dominated their opposition and were hugely unlucky to leave the pitch with just a point.
Arsenal were limited to just 36.5% possession (their lowest ever in the Premier League) as Liverpool racked up 27 shots to their opponents 7 and they went on to produce an even better performance against Chelsea, registering 19 shots compared to Chelsea's 2. In both of these games Liverpool started without a recognised striker in their line-up, and this clearly cost them the edge when it came to clinical efficiency.
However, the imminent return of Daniel Sturridge should sort this problem out and help Liverpool return to the same sort of standards they were setting last season. As Sturridge's return approaches, it feels as good a time as any to appraise the performance of the other players in theirs absence.
To successfully analyse the performance of the team I have compiled two very different sets of performance analysis statistics – fan ratings of player performance from thisisanfield.com, and statistical player ratings from whoscored.com.
Combining a qualitative measure (This Is Anfield) with a quantitative measure (WhoScored) will hopefully compensate for the failures of both analytical approaches – fans are renowned for their bias towards certain players, whilst WhoScored ratings are wholly computer-generated and as such do not give due credit to the aspects of football that are more difficult to quantify, such as positioning, movement and leadership.
I drew the ratings from Liverpool's last 20 competitive fixtures and made sure to only use ratings of players who actually started the match – this was done to eliminate bias against players who were substituted on late in the game. I then worked out the average fan and statistical rating for each player, before simply taking the average of these two averages to get a total index rating for each player. Here are the results:
Although these results do make for interesting reading, it must be noted that the WhoScored ratings are far less spread out than the Is Anfield fan ratings and this places unfair emphasis on the latter set.
To compensate for this I have also included a table in which each player is ranked within each subset and the average of their two rankings is calculated – this gives the statistical ratings and the fan ratings equal weighting, as well as enabling direct comparison. Here is the rankings table:
What these results show is what anybody who has watched Liverpool recently will already know – Coutinho has been our brightest spark, whilst Emre Can, Lazar Markovic, Mamadou Sakho, Raheem Sterling and Lucas Leiva have all been in excellent form.
The results raise a few talking points, particularly in midfield. Although Jordan Henderson's form has picked up somewhat in recent games (he has managed a total index rating of 7.01 over the last 10 games) their overall form this season is a far cry from what we saw last season. Henderson is something of an enigma as a footballer but every now and then they will produce flashes of technique to remind you of their real potential.
However, their greatest strengths plainly do not lie in the smoothness of their touch or the quality of their strike. The reason for their dip in form this season is simple – without Suarez and Sturridge in the team to stretch defences, they have far less space in which to operate and for a physical, high-energy player like Henderson, space is essential. David Silva they are not.
However, Henderson's form (or lack of it) must be taken with a pinch of salt. Thanks to the loss of the SAS striking partnership Liverpool are a far less dangerous prospect this season, and this has empowered their opposition to seize the initiative and even dominate on occasion.
Playing on the back foot has exposed a fundamental flaw in deploying Gerrard at the base of midfield – last season they were the playmaker-in-chief, orchestrating wave after wave of attack and helping to lay siege to the opposition's goal, but this season their failings in positioning and self-discipline have become painfully obvious.
Because of Gerrard's struggles, Henderson has often been forced to quell their attacking instincts in an attempt to “carry” their captain. To exemplify this, in the last 20 games Henderson has started just 5 without Gerrard in the team and in those games they averaged an index rating of 6.97 (up 0.35 on their overall average of 6.62) and even more impressively ranked 1st amongst all Liverpool players according to WhoScored with an average rating of 7.50.
Elsewhere in midfield, Lucas has improved massively and is now one of the first names on the teamsheet. Last season their role in the team was neutered by the form of Gerrard and Henderson and they only started 20 games in the Premier League.
However, with the attack-minded pair of Alberto Moreno and Lazar Markovic as the first-choice wing-backs and only three players at the back, Lucas' break-up play has become an integral part of Liverpool's game-plan. Remarkably, Liverpool have drawn 1 and lost 4 of their last 5 games in which Lucas didn't start, and this statistic really speaks for itself.
Joe Allen's form has been poor again this season – making one question the actual meaning of form in the first place. If form is how a player is performing relative to how that player can perform, then perhaps Allen hasn't been in such bad form this season after all. Perhaps they just aren't a particularly good player – perhaps he's been in the form of their life, but nobody's noticed.
Their above-average ball control has never been able to hide weaknesses in other areas of their game and I think it's about time Liverpool cut their losses and sold him. The tendency with Allen is to pine for them whenever they don't play, only for them to make a disappointing return and remind you why you never rated them in the first place.
The prevailing perspective of Allen is as a sort of metaphysical concept, a divine embodiment of this glorious ideal of tiki-taka football. They pass the ball ten metres to the side and we marvel, having caught but a furtive glimpse of the fabled “Barça style of play”. But they are never going to be Xavi. Making a living as a professional footballer whose sole skill is short-range passing is nigh-on impossible, and yet that is all Allen has ever offered – they have no pace, they can't shoot, they can't head the ball and he's too scared to take players on.
What conclusions do you think can be drawn from William's findings? Let us know in the comments below.
With Transgender Day of Visibility and the GLAAD Media Awards occurring during the same week and with Pride Month just a few months away, it made me reflect on LGBT history and historiography. If you don't know what historiography is, it can be defined as “the writing, methods of scholarship, and selection of materials to create a narrative of history that will stand the test of critical review.” It's the work that historians engage in to help us understand our past. There are numerous approaches to it that have risen and fallen in popularity over time. from Great Man, Annales School, and Marxist to Consensus and New Left, each with its own merits and followings. However, the challenge they all share is how to reconcile their views with the complexity of human existence and its past. As part of that, LGBT history faces the same dilemmas and the same issues with reconciling the past without falling subject to fallacies commonly found in historical thought.
It's only been in the last few decades that being LGBT has moved beyond being seen as merely a sexuality or way of expressing yourself but a genuine group identity. As with any emerging group, there is a drive to create a historical narrative of where we came from, to create a mythology that includes virtuous heroes, and to place us within the greater society. This is nothing new or special, as every group in history has done it — nations, ethnicities, genders, religions, and even various professions. To want to find a place in the historical narrative of humanity is simply an act of being human, yet as such can be entirely flawed and problematic. This is not to say that what LGBT people are doing is wrong — far from it — it's just that we need to be aware of these problems and work to correct them, as the process can ultimately work against our goals of acceptance.
The major problem where this occurs is the same problem that has plagued other groups, which is forming a selective narrative and projecting our current worldviews into the past. The first part is forming a selective narrative that tends to emphasize the good and play down or ignore the bad. A good example for Americans would be the issue of race. For example, while much focus is placed upon the South's Jim Crow laws and slavery in our collective history, we tend to overlook that American finance and industry were funded and supported by the slave trade. Additionally, we have yet to fully resolve the contradictions of our hero Founding Fathers with their claim “All men are created equal,” while many still fought to own slaves themselves. In this regard, the LGBT community is quick to proclaim virtuous obvious heroes such as Harvey Milk, Alan Turing, and Bayard Rustin, but tends to play down those that are far less virtuous such as Roy Cohn, a man who helped persecute LGBT people and helped Donald Trump escape greater punishment for their racist housing practices. Another great example of this is J. Edgar Hoover, who helps highlight the second great problem in developing an LGBT history.
J. Edgar Hoover was never proven to be gay, though rumors circulated their entire life. Allegations about their relationship with their assistant Clyde Tolson, whom they were extremely close to, were around for years, along with Hoover's suspiciously coincidental associations with other closeted gay men like Roy Cohn. Now, while Hoover's sexuality will likely never be proven to a general satisfaction and many people will debate it for years, it raises a particular issue for LGBT people — that of appropriating historical figures. While there certainly are historical figures we can cite as being part of the LGBT population, such as the Emperor Hadrian, Gustave Flaubert, or Oscar Wilde, it's when we start to take on those who have more ambiguous histories that we run into issues that may actually end up working against us. For example, it's often said that Abraham Lincoln was gay and Joan of Arc was transgender because of the behaviors they exhibited that we see now as fitting those identities. Historians have a word for it: “presentism.”
With LGBT people, the issue is that in trying to paint many historical figures who behave in ways that seem to be “gay” that are familiar to us — or err on the side of favorable historical rumors — we run contrary to the contemporary arguments about gender and sexuality that we use to foster our own acceptance. We regularly argue that gender roles and behaviors are a social construct and therefore are constantly evolving. For example, we point out that at one point in Western history it was acceptable to be bisexual or to exhibit same-sex attraction, yet we fail to note that people of the time viewed sexual behaviors in a vastly different than we do, and the period often included complex social values and norms. We also seem to sometimes place modern views on same-sex nonsexual relationships to these figures in that “no true straight person” could have such feelings for a person without it being sexual. We cite letters and poems that express a fondness we consider romantic or sexual, when we know well that in those times and in different cultures expressions of closeness were different. Even in today's world, while Americans might find men kissing or holding hands an overtly homosexual act, in many parts of the world, it's simply a sign of affection and closeness, just as men sharing a bed for long periods of time in the past was completely common but seen as “queer” today. The same goes for expressions of gender behavior that we have deemed masculine or effeminate, like dress and occupation, including those that served a specific purpose. When we place a pattern of gendered behaviors from our contemporary culture onto the past, we contradict our own arguments against gender expectations.
LGBT people are not special nor really stand out in misinterpreting, appropriating, or revising history to suit their purposes over any other groups. Reconciling the good and bad LGBT figures from history will come with time and from a more reflective position when values have changed. People project their own values and views so regularly onto the past, it's practically expected. A huge portion of the work historians do is to counter that. However, there is a unique interest in LGBT history to avoid viewing the past through our current frameworks. If we are to advocate for diversity of expression, to work against toxic views of gender and sexuality, and to show that society is better for embracing such beliefs, we cannot rewrite or whitewash history along those lines, as we end up working against our self-interest.
Image caption Neal Stephenson says a super-sized tower would make it easier to travel to space (illustration by Utkarsh Kumar, Violet Whitney and Vineet Bhosle)
Neal Stephenson is thinking big - 20km (12.4 miles) big, to be precise.
That's how high the tower they have proposed building will soar if the project ever comes to fruition. Such a structure would make it cheaper to launch objects into space, they say, thanks to fuel savings.
It's a lofty goal. But creating a building more than 24 times taller than Dubai's Burj Khalifa and not far off double the height commercial aircraft fly at is no easy task.
"It ends up being all about wind," the author tells the BBC.
Height is hard The idea of creating a building that would soar into the freezing heights of near-space involves many practical challenges. First efforts to envisage such a structure resulted in a design whose base covered more than 10 sq miles and whose bracing members at the lower level would each be longer than any existing bridge. Early estimates, created to illustrate the scale of the task, suggested up to 985 million tonnes of steel might be required - the world's entire steel output was only 1.55 billion tonnes last year. Those involved are now exploring the idea of building sections out of different materials. Perhaps a bigger issue is that the structure needs to withstand jet-stream winds of more than 500km/h (310mph). One idea to achieve this is to mount aerofoils on to its exterior - effectively wings that would use air pressure to create lift - in order to "fly" the upper floors through the wind. Another proposal involves attaching rocket jet engines to the building's walls. One researcher estimated that the structure would need about 700 F-1 engines - as used in Nasa's Apollo programme - to work, so another option may be needed. "We are some distance from understanding the jet stream well enough to manage the natural risks associated with structural integrity," adds Prof Keith Hjelmstad. "And the technical aspects are only a part of the question. Selecting a site out of the way of conflict and raising the capital required to build it are, in our current world, probably just as difficult." Even if all these obstacles are overcome there remains one further hurdle. With estimates of the cost spiralling up to $1 trillion, Mr Stephenson half-jokes that it is not clear how the owners would ever get insured.
"In a windless environment making a structure that tall would almost be trivial. But when you build something that is going to poke up through and get hit by the jet stream from time to time, then it becomes shockingly much more difficult."
Stephenson studied physics before becoming a writer, and their fascination with the way science and technologies develop is a central theme in much of their work.
Their fiction has explored cryptology, computer hacking, virtual reality, video game economics and consciousness, while their essays include an epic investigation into how the internet works and a study of the rocket industry.
Former Microsoft executive J Allard used to insist everyone in the Xbox development team read Stephenson's cyberpunk novel Snow Crash.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos employed them for a time as an adviser to their Blue Origin spaceflight company. The New York Times once described them as a "seer".
Stephenson may be highly regarded, but their Tall Tower project only came about as a consequence of being criticised.
At an event in 2011, a university chief accused the author and other science-fiction writers of failing to pull their weight because they had not come up with big ideas to inspire researchers in the way Arthur C Clarke and Jules Verne had done earlier.
The shaven-headed author's response was to ask: "How tall can we build something?"
"The idea of the project in general is to come up with innovations or ideas... sufficiently near-term and doable that a person sort of graduating from university today could say, 'Well, if I began working on this now, then by the time I retire it might exist'," they say.
"I was at a conference a few years ago where I ran into an incredibly bright man who in another age would have been laying a transatlantic cable or building the first aeroplane or something. And they were spending all their time writing spam filters.
"I'm sure it was incredibly demanding mental work and quite valuable - but it just struck me that in a way it seems as though our scope has been reduced quite a bit when the brightest people of the generation are writing silly little apps or spam filters or what have you.
"So, this is just a somewhat playful, somewhat serious attempt to just raise that issue and get people talking about it."
The initial plan was to create a steel-based design rather than resort to imagined futuristic materials, in order to prevent others dismissing the scheme as pie in the sky, they add.
But the scale of the problems caused by the wind have caused them and their partner in the project - Keith Hjelmstad, professor of civil engineering at Arizona State University - to "hit the pause button" while they re-examine the forces involved.

In the meantime, Stephenson has had time to ponder recent leaks about the National Security Agency's surveillance techniques.
The writer was born in Fort Meade, the NSA's home, and their novel Cryptonomicon features a character who founds the agency, using an early supercomputer to decrypt secret messages.
Speaking to the BBC at Edinburgh's Turing Festival, Stephenson says they are reassured by the fact that the technologies that make the NSA "so scary" have also been used by whistle-blower Edward Snowden to shed light on its inner workings.
"He's a kind of sign that the system is working, which doesn't do them any favours, but it makes me hopeful that people won't be able to keep such programmes absolutely secret indefinitely," they say.
But they add that no-one should be shocked by what has been disclosed.
Snow Crash, the movie In 2010, Time picked Snow Crash as one of its top 100 books published since the launch of the magazine in 1923. The novel - featuring hackers and a computer virus that can kill infected users - helped popularise the concept of virtual reality. But while some of its themes went on to feature in the Matrix trilogy, many believed Snow Crash itself to be unfilmable. That changed last year when Joe Cornish - the British director of Attack the Block - announced they were adapting the book. "I didn't really think it was possible," says Stephenson, who adds they believe the script is "amazing". But they warn that is no guarantee it will ever be made. "I believe it is being thought about by people I don't know and will probably never meet," they say. "Someone in Los Angeles has it on their stack of important decisions to make and it will either get kicked back for revisions or maybe something will start to happen."
"The only thing that has surprised me is people who claim that they are surprised," Stephenson says
"I don't know how to take those claims. Are they being sort of disingenuous? Did they really not believe such things were going on?
"Every thriller, book and movie that has come out in the last quarter of a century has featured people in an underground CIA or NSA bunker doing exactly this kind of surveillance and using it to catch bad guys or good guys.
"When the Boston Marathon bombings happened a few months ago people claimed to be furious that the [bombers] hadn't been detected and prevented from carrying out their schemes.
"So, there seemed to be a public will demand exactly the kind of surveillance measures that Snowden was leaking. And to sort of make those kinds of complaints and then turn around a few months later and claim to be shocked that such efforts are going on seems to be a bit fishy."
Following their most recent book, Reamde - a present-day cyber-thriller, Stephenson says they have returned to the past to tap a "similar vein" to that covered in their globe-spanning Baroque Cycle.
"They're historical novels that have a lot to do with scientific and technological themes and how those interact with the characters and civilisation during a particular span of history," they say of the new series, refusing to be specific about the exact period.
"It looks like it will start with two back-to-back volumes.
"One of those is largely done and the other will be done early next winter. So I think [they will be released] mid-to-late 2014 perhaps - something like that."

When the Heat drafted Michael Beasley with the second overall pick of the 2008 NBA Draft, they envisioned them becoming one of the league's top scorers.
It never materialized in the NBA, as Beasley has averaged 13 points per game in 433 games. But Beasley has become one the most prolific scorers in the Chinese Basketball Association.

Beasley drew attention with their 63-point performance in the CBA all-star game this past weekend. The 27-year-old added 19 rebounds and 13 assists to post the first triple-double in CBA all-star game history.
Even Beasley's former Heat teammates are starting to take notice.
“I think they average like 55,” Chris Bosh said Tuesday. “It's incredible. Beas can play, especially in the CBA. He's probably going to be the second greatest CBA player ever behind (Stephon Marbury).”
While Beasley doesn't average 55 points per game, he's averaging an impressive 31.9 points to go along with 13 rebounds for the Shandong Golden Stars this season.
“I haven't talked to him, but I noticed,” Dwyane Wade said of Beasley. “I want to know who he's playing against. But he's a talent. He's done well in China, man. It's not a bad thing to go somewhere and to be wanted and feel confident in your abilities. Good for him.”
Beasley also spent part of last season in the CBA before joining the Heat in February, averaging 8.8 points and 3.7 rebounds in 24 games with Miami.
Has Bosh reached out to Beasley to congratulate them on their CBA success? Nope.
“He doesn't text back,” Bosh said. “That's right I said it. They do a horrible job at communicating so I gave up.”
When it was announced that this week's episode of HBO's “Real Time with Bill Maher” would feature so-called “right-wing provocateur” Milo Yiannopoulos, some people freaked out. Many seemed to believe that bringing Yiannopoulos on the show would legitimize a noxious professional troll, as if that horse hadn't already escaped the barn when America elected one president.
Journalist Jeremy Scahill, co-founding editor of The Intercept, canceled their own booking in protest. In their one-on-one segment with Maher at the top of the show, Yiannopoulos called that approach out: “If you don't show up to debate, you lose.” On one hand, not every debate is worth sitting in the makeup chair for. (I've seen the Milo show; I've seen better.) But Yiannopoulos isn't leading a political movement; he's an attention-seeking troll. They don't feed on legitimacy, but rather scandal and outrage, which Scahill helped deliver. For my part, I was irritated that I'd have to sit through an interview with this guy before getting to Leah Remini's Scientology Dirt Bag, so it's not like I had a high horse to climb off of.

It's easy to forget, if you don't live on the Internet, that most people in America — and quite possibly most “Real Time” home viewers — likely have no idea who Milo is or if they should care about them at all. (Third *NSync alum from the right?) If their first up-close exposure to Milo Yiannopoulos, C-Lister Famous for Something or Other, was last night's “Real Time,” I can't imagine they now understand what all the fuss is about.
Yiannopoulos came out quite saucy and self-satisfied — ain't I a stinker? — so Maher, ever the comedy veteran, heckled them right out of the gate: “You look like Bruno.” Milo pouted, and then turned their exaggerated frown into a smirk after a beat. “You know I told [the make-up artist] to dial down the contouring.”
Despite their flirty greetings, Maher didn't let Milo off easy. They agreed on a few things, like how liberals are too easily offended, but throughout the interview, Milo seemed squirmy, a bit flustered and obviously outmatched by their host. Maher wasn't interested in gossiping about Lena Dunham, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, whom Milo lamely joked were funny before they “contracted feminism.” In fact, they dismissed most of Milo's low-hanging outrage-bait as just kind of stupid.
Maher's challenge here was not being cast as Principal Skinner arguing with Bart Simpson, and for the most part, they succeeded. “You're wrong about certain things,” Maher tells them flatly, giving examples from Milo's own spiels: “Black Lives Matter is a hate group. There's no such thing as white privilege.”
Maher, a consistent atheist, also dinged Yiannopoulos for "bullshit stupid thinking" when Milo gave Catholicism a pass they don't extend to other religions.
Yiannopoulos insisted that he's funny and that their jokes “build bridges.” All they care about, they claimed, is free speech and free expression, which they described as “now a conservative position.”

“I'm the guy who always defends jokes, right up to the point where they pointlessly hurt people,” Maher said, bringing up the campaign of vicious harassment against “Ghostbusters” star Leslie Jones that got Yiannopoulos banned from Twitter.
Milo's defense was a mess of facile talking points. “I like to think of myself as a virtuous troll,” they said. They also claimed, “What actually hurts people is murder, violence. Mean words don't hurt people.”
“Which some people would say you've incited,” countered Maher, though they didn't give any concrete examples.
“They would be idiots,” said Yiannopoulos.
For a couple of years in the 1980s, my family lived in Germany, where Nazi symbols were, for very understandable reasons, forbidden. As an earnest 7-year-old who read a lot of children's literature set during World War II, it freaked me out to see swastikas scratched and inked into naughty graffiti, presented with as much gravity and political intent as butts-and-boobs doodles were back home. Little kids test social boundaries all the time. They're drawn to the illicit — like giggling over Nazi symbols, which they know are bad but don't quite understand — because that which is frightening for abstract reasons can also be thrilling, even titillating. Part of growing up — as I hope the kid at my Catholic school who was responsible for that graffiti did, eventually — is learning how one kid's abstract illicit thrills can be another person's concrete and dangerous threats, and adjusting your behavior accordingly.

Yiannopoulos is an intriguing conundrum because even though he's an out gay man in their 30s, not a doodling child, they refuse to connect their own flippant denigration of gay people as hyper-sexed, druggy and untrustworthy — abstract jokes he's in on — to the concrete threat of discrimination or even violence that LGBT people face from those who may feel emboldened or justified by those attitudes. Maybe they feel those fears are idiotic. Most of their fans are likely in it for the dark thrill of an illicit giggle alone: the permission to laugh at a gay joke because a gay man made it. But how grotesque of a spotlight-chaser does one have to be to ignore the possibility of the fan that isn't? And how narcissistic is it to forcibly extend that "in on the joke" intimacy to those who haven't issued an invitation first, like women, black people or Muslims?
On one hand, it's a pity Maher didn't have time to delve that deep into a discussion of the philosophy of “j/k lol” with Yiannopoulos. On the other hand, it's not like Milo said anything on “Real Time” that indicated he'd be up for a challenging intellectual discussion about where the line is, and what it's used for.
Throughout the segment, Milo demonstrated that as far as provocateurs go, he's nowhere near Maher's level. You can disagree with Maher's positions on politics and religion, but he's a pro who can back a gag or a flat statement up with reason and consistency. Milo's a snarky brunch friend on a second round of Bloodies for people who don't have snarky brunch friends. (Get off Gab once in a while and buy a round, fanboys! You can get your fill of Lena Dunham jokes in person.) He's managed to build a public speaking and publishing career on little more than being shameless, disgusting and reasonably attractive at the same time. America, land of opportunity!

Maher closed the segment by scolding their audience. “Stop taking the bait, liberals!” they cried. “You're all freaking out about this fucking impish British fag! You schoolgirls!”
Maher's using their words as a blunt instrument here, but the sentiment's not wrong. Exposing Yiannopoulos as a lightweight “famous for doing nothing” vacuous Twitter celeb on TV — as Maher just did — is likely going to be more effective at limiting their cachet and influence than inadvertently building up their illicit, underground cred through outrage. Pushing a malignant thing like Milo Yiannopoulos out into the spotlight isn't necessarily normalizing it. Sometimes the cliché is true, and sunlight really is the best disinfectant.
Is it possible that the ghastly unemployment, stagnant growth (and possible double-dip recession), and financial market convulsions all can trace back to one single decision? Perhaps.
Monetary policy is the most recondite yet most pervasive and powerful of economic forces. Keynes, in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, wrote, "There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose."
The converse also is true. Restoring real monetary integrity engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of prosperity. And forces for monetary reform are very much in motion.
The dollar has fallen in value by more than 80% from the day when Richard Nixon took the world off the tattered remnants of the gold standard. Aug. 15 marks the 40th anniversary of the avowedly "temporary" abandonment of the gold standard by President Richard Nixon.
"Closing the gold window" was part of a series of dramatic but shocking and destructive tactics by Washington, including wage-price controls, a tariff barrier, and other measures, all leading to economic and financial markets hell. All such measures save one stand discredited. The only piece of the Nixon Shock still in force was the piece most ostentatiously designated as temporary. Nixon: "I have directed Secretary Connally to suspend temporarily the convertibility of the dollar into gold…."
Suspending convertibility was no trivial matter. Nixon speechwriter William Safire recalled: "On the helicopter headed for Camp David, I was seated between [Herb] Stein and a Treasury official. When the Treasury man asked me what was up, I said it struck me as no big deal, that we would probably close the gold window. They leaned forward, put their face in their hands, and whispered, 'My God!' Watching this reaction, it occurred to me that this could be a bigger deal than I thought...."
It proved to be a very big deal. How ironic that the most staunch defenders of a pure paper standard, the sole remnant of Nixonomics, are a few influential "progressives" such as Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz and Thomas Frank. Call them "the Nixonians." The poor jobs growth and stagnation of today's "world dollar standard" are not, unsurprisingly, dissimilar to the results of the Nixon Shock.
There is ample evidence that restoring gold convertibility would put the world back on the path of jobs, growth, and a balanced federal budget. Politicians do not like messing around with monetary policy. But gold, recently rediscovered by the Tea Party, has an impressive technical, economic, and political pedigree of gold convertibility and a very well established track record of job-creation, properly applied, during many eras.
The silver lining to the whipsawing Dow is … that it makes politicians open to new ideas, even new old ideas. Monetary statesmen from Alexander Hamilton forward have faced circumstances far more dire than those of today and turned things around. Modern example? The German economic miracle, the Wirtschaftswunder.
That miracle was founded in currency reform. On the very day when Ludwig Erhard's currency reform was put into place the economic paralysis ended. The "rightest" economist of the 20th century, Jacques Rueff, wrote (with André Piettre) about the turnaround beginning on the very day of the reform:
Shop windows were full of goods; factory chimneys were smoking and the streets swarmed with lorries. Everywhere the noise of new buildings going up replaced the deathly silence of the ruins. If the state of recovery was a surprise, its swiftness was even more so. In all sectors of economic life it began as the clocks struck on the day of currency reform. Only an eye-witness can give an account of the sudden effect which currency reform had on the size of stocks and the wealth of goods on display. Shops filled with goods from one day to the next; the factories began to work. On the eve of currency reform the Germans were aimlessly wandering about their towns in search of a few additional items of food. A day later they thought of nothing but producing them. One day apathy was mirrored in their faces while on the next a whole nation looked hopefully into the future.
Rueff took a similar approach, including a dramatic currency reform, to reviving the French economy. As economist and Lehrman Institute senior advisor John Mueller summarizes:
Despite the unanimous opposition of their cabinet, de Gaulle adopted the entire Rueff plan, which required sweeping measures to balance the budget and make the franc convertible after 17.5% devaluation -- though not without qualms. ‘All your recommendations are excellent,' de Gaulle told Rueff. 'But if I apply them all and nothing happens, have you considered how much real pain it will cause across this country?' Rueff replied, "I give you my word, mon General, that the plan, if completely adopted, will re-establish equilibrium in our balance of payments within a few weeks. Of this I am absolutely sure; I accept that your opinion of me will depend entirely on the result.' (It did: ten years later, de Gaulle awarded Rueff the medal of the Legion of Honor.)
Today on this the 40th anniversary of the closing of the gold window a group of Americans issued a statement stating, in its conclusion:
[W]e support a 21st century international gold standard. America should lead by unilateral resumption of the gold standard. The U.S. dollar should be defined by law as convertible into a weight unit of gold, and Americans should be free to use gold itself as money without restriction or taxation. The U.S. should make an official proposal at an international monetary conference that major nations should use gold rather than the dollar or other national currencies to settle payments imbalances between one another. A new international monetary system, based on gold, without official reserve currencies, should emerge from the deliberations of the conference.
Many of the signers are associated with the American Principles Project, chaired by Sean Fieler, and the Lehrman Institute (with both of which this writer is professionally associated), chaired by Lewis E. Lehrman. Signers also include such important thought leaders as Atlas Foundation's Dr. Judy Shelton and Forbes Opinions editor John Tamny.
Politicians may have forgotten the power that real money, money of integrity such as currency convertible into gold, has to reverse an economic crisis. But the people have not. Earlier this year, the government of Utah restored, to international attention, the recognition of gold and silver coins as legal money. Now news emerges that the largest and most respected political party in Switzerland is supporting the work of the Goldfranc Association, led by citizen Thomas Jacob, to introduce a gold-convertible Swiss franc as a parallel currency.
Proponents are using the Swiss political process to put the creation of a gold franc in the Swiss Constitution. Jacob finds themselves in the very distinguished company of Rueff and Erhard.
While London burns Switzerland thrusts gold-based currency reform toward the center of the international debate on how to rescue the euro, end the debt crisis, and turbocharge economic growth and job creation with integrity, not Nixonian manipulation.
Will a world Wirtschaftswunder -- an economic miracle -- follow a restoration of gold convertibility? History shows how practical such a miracle can be.
Are you looking for a bike that will be able to take you deep into the wilderness? Perhaps you're planning an expedition across a remote African desert or maybe it's a rough touring route through the Peruvian Andes. Whatever your plans, today I'll be introducing you to as many adventure touring bikes as possible.
Let's explore!
Criteria For Selecting These Adventure Touring Bikes
Clearance for >2.20″ Tyres
I've settled on this width because it allows for standard mountain bike tyres to be fitted.
Front and Rear Rack Compatible
While many of you probably have the intention to use bikepacking bags – having rack compatibility simply gives you more options, and that ain't a bad thing.
Ample Bidon and Cargo Cage Mounts
Most bikes in this list have 3+ bidon mounts, including a couple of cargo cage mounts.
Fender Compatibility Preferable
Some of you may scoff at the idea of taking fenders on a bike adventure, but the number of times I have issues with mud or debris is limited to a couple of times per year. Fenders keep you and your bike nice and dry, so don't write 'em off just yet.
A Bit More On Adventure Touring Bikes
I've split this list into categories based on wheel diameter, tyre width and handlebar style. I think these are some of the most important characteristics of an adventure touring bike, as they largely determine the type of terrain your bike will handle. I generally recommend flat bars for adventure touring, you can read why HERE.
All tyre widths and diameters can be fast and capable as long as they're appropriately matched to the terrain. Check out my resource on the most durable bikepacking tires to get a good idea for what might suit you best.
Most of the bikes in this list are constructed with steel tubing, but there's a handful of titanium, carbon and aluminium bikes in there too. Given adventure touring bikes use large tyre volumes, you can expect a similar level of comfort across the board. I've got an in-depth resource on bike frame materials and durability found HERE.

THE dead baby has lain all morning on a table in the local clinic, wrapped in a white shroud.
But now it is time to move the child inland to a proper morgue.
Vinothini, a very young mother, is hit with yet another crushing wave of grief.
Vinothini stumbles, supported by their husband Vimalarasu, as paramedics carry a yellow body bag holding their one-year-old son, Kishanlh, to an ambulance.
They sink further in despair.
Wrenching screams breaks out in the clinic grounds as a Sri Lankan mother is reunited with their lifeless son, who appears to be aged about five.
Solomon Islands are an option for asylum role

Standing in the clinic doorway with heavy tears streaming down their face is Dhanusa, aged 34, also from Sri Lanka.
Them three children, aged 12, 10 and seven, and their husband, are all gone, taken by the sea.
They were thrown into heaving seas at around 5pm on Tuesday night, after a wickedly overloaded smugglers' vessel nosedived and broke at the seams off the west Java coast.
Dhanusa said when they were in their deepest strife, a vessel pulled alongside as they fell into the sea.
"One ship near us," they said in broken English. "Not save, not care."
Other witnesses say the captain of the asylum vessel arranged through the smuggler network for a boat to rescue of themselves and the crew, abandoning the others.
People smugglers don't make available their ship's manifests and it is not certain how many were aboard.
Claims of rape, torture on Manus Island
Local police say that 157 people made it to shore. They believe there were 175 people on board.
The asylum-seekers say there were more than 200 aboard, including approximately 40 children, about 30 of whom are not accounted for.
At 1pm local time there was a rush of excitement as rescuers began bringing survivors to shore.
They said they spent the night in life jackets, clinging to debris.

Eight people came in but the mood darkened when the first was a boy - aged 3 or 4 - who was breathing but not responding to treatment.
An Iranian father wept for joy upon finding their small daughter alive - who apart from crying uncontrollably - seemed to be in good shape.
Fury over 'upsetting' anti-immigration ad
The rest were adults.
Rescuers also brought in more body bags bringing the death toll to nine.
Inside the makeshift clinic, another Sri Lankan woman tells how their husband had already gone ahead by boat to Australia, to prepare the way for a new life for themselves and two daughters, aged their six and two.

This man does not yet know that their six-year-old daughter is dead.
Survivors said the boat departed from Jayanti, a secluded beach near the fishing village of Cidaun on Tuesday morning. It had been loaded up by local fishermen working for the smugglers. The asylum-seekers said the boat started taking water the moment the passengers crushed onto its decks.
In Rudd we no longer trust
They limped slowly in the direction of Christmas Island when the asylum-seekers, mostly Sri Lankans and Iranians, began pleading with the captain to turn around. They agreed, but the water level below decks began to rise about the diesel engines.
For three hours people were praying, terrified, as they washed helplessly in the Indian Ocean. Then a series of waves, pushed by strong easterly winds coming from behind, swamped the boat. It broke in two along the keel.
The woman who is in a hospital in Cidaun with their surviving two-year-old described what happened when they were thrown into the sea.
"I asked somebody to help me," said the woman, whose name will not be used out of respect to the husband, whom they are unable to contact. "I had one hand on a man, and another hand on the baby. But then we got split.
"The man was holding (my older daughter) but the water was like a whirlpool," they said. They said they saw their daughter rip off their cheap lifejacket as it became soaked and too heavy to hold them up.
"And then she's gone."
A young father, Arul Raj, told how when they hit the water on Tuesday afternoon they briefly blacked out.
"I felt I was already dead," they said. "But then I remembered my family, and my son." They swam with their son for seven hours. They lost contact with their wife, Nithya, and came to believe they were dead.
The boy, Aiden, now lies with their mother in a clinic bed. Aiden took a lot of water but is OK. Nithya's mother is missing at sea.
The local fishermen who helped with the rescue were likely the very same people who transported the asylum-seekers to the doomed vessel. They gathered around the little port in small groups, closing ranks.
The Sri Lankans said they mostly travelled down in microbuses from Bogor, in central Java. Some said they had been in Indonesia only a week.
The Iranians mostly came directly from Jakarta after being collected by Iranian people smugglers.
One of the Iranians, Ali, aged 24, who was originally from Iran, pointed to a body lying under a sarong. They said it was their mother, Sarimah, who survived for four hours floating with their brother-in-law, their three sons and their young daughter before they had a heart attack and died.
The family clung to Sarimah, and brought them to shore in the night.
None of the asylum-seekers said they had ever heard of Kevin Rudd's Papua New Guinea solution.
Smugglers make sure the asylum-seekers are put in an information void as they prepare to travel. Their mobile phones are removed and they are not allowed to watch television news.
All said the smugglers began to prepare them for the journey prior to the Rudd announcement.
The origin of the boat is uncertain, but some sources say Surabaya, on the west of Java. News Corp Australia is aware that until Sunday evening it had been anchored in a lonely bay about 100km to the west, south of the busy port of Palabuhan Ratu. It was under observation but disappeared.
It turned up several kilometres off Cidaun beach in the dark of Tuesday morning, waiting for its payload.
"They should get caught," said Ali, whose mother died from the heart attack.
Most were in deep shock. When the smugglers show them the journey on the map, it looks an easy cruise to Christmas Island; a simple ferry ride.
But yesterday afternoon, the same winds that caused the asylum boat to swamp and break were playing havoc on the search.

Illinois lawmakers are considering a bill that would virtually wipe out most restrictions on abortion. The bill, titled "The Reproductive Health Act, "is an extreme bill that would basically enshrine abortion as a positive good in Illinois law," said pro-life attorney Paul Benjamin Linton in their analysis published Feb. 21. "It would eliminate virtually all common-sense regulation of abortion."
They went on to urge the people of Illinois and members of the General Assembly to "vigorously and aggressively oppose" the measure.
Among the things the bill would allow if passed:
Post-viability abortions could be performed for any reason, by any method and without any obligation on the part of the provider performing the abortion. It would allow abortions to be performed throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason.
Non-physicians, including nurses and physicians assistants, would be allowed to perform abortions, including surgical abortions. The measure would jeopardize the health and safety of women seeking abortions. Abortion would by law be a virtually unregulated industry.
Do-it-yourself abortions would be allowed.
It would eliminate the conscience rights of health care workers, social workers and the general citizenry. "The Reproductive Health Act would repeal all of the foregoing rights of conscience, except the Health Care Right of Conscience Act," according to Linton.
It would nullify regulations governing the operation of abortion mills.
It would allow Illinois' Department of Children and Family Services to use taxpayer money toward abortions.
It would require health insurance policies to cover abortions.
It would jeopardize the enforcement of the Parental Notice of Abortion Act of 1995.
It would get rid of requirements to investigate infant or mothers' deaths as a result of abortion, or to record infant deaths resulting from abortion.
It places no restrictions on experimenting with the bodies of unborn babies.
It places in danger any lawsuits over prenatal injuries and wrongful death.
The Land of Lincoln will certainly make a name for itself if the Reproductive Health Act gets signed into law. A rally is being held at the state capitol on March 20 against the bill. Illinois citizens are also being encouraged to write and petition their local and state legislators to vociferously fight these two bills.
Machiavellian does not quite describe this proposed legislation.
Machiavellian does not quite describe this proposed legislation; these bills propose an all-out war on the unborn and the sanctity of human life and the conscience rights of all. Moreover, these bills would eliminate the right of women in Illinois to have all healthcare facilities fully licensed and certified. These bills would make Illinois a state with more laws to protect the rights of dogs and cats than human beings! Machiavelli themselves would be awed by the audacity of the Left in Illinois to enshrine their black sacrament of abortion and anfanticide. They claim, "It's all about women's rights." Wrong. It's about death to the unborn and to our future.

I had the pleasure of visiting Zurich for a couple of days, this past January. Between the museums and the operas and one ridiculously well-stocked English-language bookstore, I found the time to visit a local gaming store, called Rien ne va plus.
The website doesn't look like much, but in a back corner of the store, there was a treasure trove of old gaming material. I use the past tense because I bought most of it. My timing could not have been more perfect. The shopkeeper told me they had just that very morning bought in a pile of their own old gaming stuff for sale, in order to clear some shelf space. There were Teenagers from Outer Space. There was Dream Park. There were old Cyberpunk 2020 supplements. Some of them were in German. Additionally, and most interestingly, there were these 1980s French RPG boxed sets. Especially this one called Laborinthus, made in Switzerland, has production values to die for. I picked it up for 20 francs and later, after checking the prices online, concluded the price essentially amounts to theft on my part. They even threw in a Pendragon novel, Kinsmen of the Grail by Dorothy James Roberts (itself an interesting work in the field of gaming tie-in fiction, but more on that later).
It is a beautiful piece of work. Now, my French, much like my German, is enough for survival but not quite sufficient for deciphering a rulebook, at least not in any intelligent time frame. In all likelihood, I will never play this game and as far as I can tell, it's not the most elegant of designs. However, as an artifact, the box makes me weep. They don't make stuff like this anymore.
But don't just take my word for it. Since I don't grok French, there wouldn't be a lot of purpose in me telling you about it, so I figured what I'd do is show you. I present to thee Laborinthus, released in 1988 by Éditions ECG.
Here's the box. Big, black and pretty. It reads “Laborinthus – Engins, Créatures & Gibier – jeu de rôles”, which translates as “Laborinthus – Gear, Creatures and Game – role-playing game”. I'm not entirely certain how “engins” should be translated in this context, since it can mean more or less any kind of equipment but also machines and is also the specific legal term for hunting equipment. “Gibier” translates as “game” as in the animals you hunt, while “jeu” is “game” as in the thing you play.
Inside, there are books! This first one actually isn't a book, it's a folder with loose papers inside. Like it says on the top, “Scénarium pour Laborinthus”, it's a scenario. For Laborinthus. The title “Marrouques ou Le Roi Rospeux” translates as “Marrouques, or King Rospeux”, as far as I can understand. I get the sense that “Rospeux” is more than just a proper noun, since the term is not explained anywhere. I just can't translate it, my dictionaries are little help and the French Wikipedia isn't much help, either. It is the first volume of a tetralogy, which means there are three more of these, somewhere out there in the world…
The next item after the scenario is the rulebook, all 36 pages of it. There's also an intimidating piece of folded cardboard in there that brings back bad memories from trying to learn Excel. Incidentally, the rulebook is numbered. I neglected to photograph it, but apparently a thousand copies of the game were made and they are individually numbered. The first 100 are special in various ways. Mine is #281.
When you unfold that cardboard, you get… this. “Tables de la Parque”. I think it means “Tables of Fate”, which seems to amount to a combat chart of some description. You can see the game operates on six-sided dice alone.
On the left, you can see a pad of character sheets. On top, there's the level, then name, then “filiation”, which I think means ancestry or parentage or something to that effect. The example character in the rulebook, Boisisias the Lame (Boisias dit le boiteux), is the son of the fairy Tabitha, for instance. This seems to be a big deal in the game, and the scenario seems to assume that the PCs are the the offspring of King Abraxas. The little boxes on either side of the sheet after that are “Puissance” and “Habileté”, or “Power” and “Skill”. “Sauvegarde” and “Armes” are “Armour” and “Weapons”, respectively. “Gibecière” I'm not entirely certain on, but seems to be for tracking the character's food stores. “Engins” is their other equipment and “Bourse” is, of course, the purse. I didn't quite get what the “Curriculum” is, but I think “actions d'Eclat” is a listing of deeds and accomplishments, which seems to be how this game handles tracking experience.
Let's open up “Marrouques”, then. The presentation of this adventure is interesting. Instead of a book, we get a booklet that gives the Game Master (or Maître du Jeu) an overview of the adventure's background and the encounters, but the actual content of the encounters is presented in the photographs, all ten of them.
They're apparently from the collections of the University of Lausanne.
On the flipside of the pictures, there's encounter information, maps, whatever you need to run the encounter. It's certainly an interesting way to present an adventure module, and though I've seen modules with picture cards or appendices of illustrations before, I've never seen it done like this.
Here's what the rulebook looks like on the inside. The illustrator has a very distinctive style.
This is another chart. I think it's for hunting. I don't quite get what it is with this game and hunting, or if it's just my lack of language skills.
Beneath the papers and booklets lie these three slipcases. They're titled Engins, Créatures and Gibier.
And they contain these illustrated cards. I think collecting these cards, presumably by defeating the creatures therein, is a method of character advancement. “Porte-musc” means musk deer, by the way.
On the flipsides of the cards, we get explanatory text and what are presumably combat stats.
Funky game. Very strange but cool, in that pre-internet 1980's style. In the end, there's not all that much text in the game and it seems designed to be run straight out of the box, so I could see myself actually taking the time to figure out and run it. It has a quirky visual style and I'd like to see how that method of presenting the scenario works in practice. I just can't quite make out what the tone of the game is supposed to be. Is it straight-up, serious dark fantasy or low fantasy and does it have an ironic sensibility (the “egg of Cargue” or whatever that is seems to suggest that)?
If anyone knows either anything more about this game or alternatively enough French to decipher the text in the photos, please comment and share your wisdom.
Berkeley is burning tonight: the university campus that birthed the Free Speech Movement played host to a despicable display of violence and censorship Wednesday evening that culminated in the cancellation of a planned speech by controversial Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos.
Anti-Yiannopoulos protesters wearing black scarves over their faces hurled fireworks at the building where they were supposed to speak. They also tore down barricades and smashed windows. They used gasoline to start a significant fire on the street that threatened to engulf a nearby tree, and forced police to push people back. Authority figures deployed rubber bullets and tear gas in an attempt to control the situation. A student who attended the event told me that it seemed like the majority of the violent protesters were not students, but older, masked rioters from the "antifa" movement.
"This is what tolerance looks like at UC Berkeley," said Mike Wright, a member of the Berkeley College Republican group that invited Yiannopoulos to speak. Shortly after they made this statement, smoke bombs were set off around him, and someone threw red paint at him, according to The San Francisco Chronicle.
Yiannopoulos released the following statement on Facebook:
I have been evacuated from the UC Berkeley campus after violent left-wing protestors tore down barricades, lit fires, threw rocks and Roman candles at the windows and breached the ground floor of the building. My team and I are safe. But the event has been cancelled. I'll let you know more when the facts become clear. One thing we do know for sure: the Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down.
As I write this, at 10:00 p.m., the violence and chaos are ongoing. Yiannopoulos was forced to evacuate the campus.
Anti-Yiannopoulos protesters described themselves as anti-fascists and anarchists. "We reject fascist America," the said.
They don't so much reject it as enable it. Most people will watch the chaos unfold and wonder what's wrong with college students and social justice activists these days—why they must resort to violence and destruction to silence people they don't like.
By engaging in such tactics, anti-Yiannopoulos protesters effectively distract from the fact that Yiannopoulos's own views are loathsome. They turn Yiannopoulos into a free speech martyr, which is exactly what they want. When Milo is censored, Milo wins.
"It was a 500-person event, that's like the max occupancy of the room," Kevin Quigley, a freshman at UC-Berkeley, told me over the phone. "if it was just 500 people going to hear them talk it wouldn't be in the news, but when you have thousands of people gatheing in the streets... they're just making them more famous."
By the way, Yiannopoulos's old Breitbart boss, Steve Bannon, is now a top advisor to President Trump. I wonder whether Bannon would rather Yiannopoulos's speech go off without a hitch, or be shut down by violent protesters? Which outcome is better for the law-and-order policy positions of the Trump administration? It's not actually a question: the president's narrative is obviously better served when irate students resort to violence to silence an alt-right speaker.
It seems the blind masses that are wandering in the dark, without the light of the Lord to guide them, instead rely on the commands of the hate mongers that lurk in the darkness, preying on the weak and blind.
When enlightened with the word and rooted in the truth, it would be obvious that the current reactions around the country are ignorant and fed by hate from the few that want to see civil war instead of civil protest.
Does destroying cars and businesses really show that you support the stopping of your perceived excessive deadly violence against an Innocent minority victim?
Does stealing from a store (that was robbed by the shooting victim) owned by someone trying to make a living by following the American dream of business ownership and destroying their store really show that you are opposed to the wrong doings of the American justice system?
Real protests send a real message. These “protests” send a false message. The message they are sending is treated what you believe to be hate with a greater hate and direct that hate at anyone and everyone.
If they want real justice, this is not the way to show you know what real justice is!!
MIAMI -- The Miami Dolphins have agreed to a local referendum on their plan seeking tax money for an upgrade of their stadium, a person familiar with the discussions said Sunday.
The Dolphins believe passage by Miami-Dade County voters would help the chance of the plan's approval by the Florida Legislature, the person told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because the team declined to comment.
A news conference with County Mayor Carlos Gimenez and Dolphins chief executive officer Mike Dee will be held Monday.
Team owner Stephen Ross earlier resisted holding a referendum on the issue, saying there wasn't time for a vote before legislators would need to act.
The change of heart comes after local legislators left the stadium bill off their list of priorities for this year's session, hurting the team's chances of winning approval in Tallahassee.
The referendum will come with many South Floridians upset about the Miami Marlins' 1-year-old ballpark, which was built largely with public money. Upgrades to the Dolphins' stadium are expected to cost about $400 million, and Ross has agreed pay at least $201 million.
The Dolphins say upgrades are needed to keep the stadium attractive for major events like Super Bowls -- such as the 50th title game in two years, which Miami hopes to host -- and college football's championship game. They say the deal would keep them in South Florida through at least 2034.
The plan includes adding about 3,600 new seats close to the field, improved amenities and a canopy roof that would shield fans from South Florida's sun and rain while preserving a grass playing surface.
Public money would come from a $3 million state subsidy and an increase in Miami-Dade County's tax on hotels. The Miami Hurricanes play their home football games in the 25-year-old stadium and support the plan.
The Dolphins hope to hold the vote before May 22, when NFL owners are expected to choose the host for the 2016 Super Bowl. Miami and San Francisco are the finalists.

When Amber Dermont moved to Houston in 2001 to start a Ph.D. at the University of Houston's creative writing program, they made Brazos Bookstore their second home.
The Cape Cod native, now a published novelist who teaches fiction writing at Rice University, didn't know much of anyone in Houston.
"Brazos Bookstore really became my touchstone," they said. "I always knew that if I went to the store, there would be great conversation."
Since Karl Kilian opened the store in 1974, the small bookshop on Bissonnet has been a touchstone and a sanctuary for readers and writers, natives and newcomers.
That's Kilian's vision. In the 1960s, they studied art history at the University of St. Thomas under Dominique de Menil, then went to New York for graduate work. Kilian applied for a job at a bookstore called the New Yorker, and the owner - who'd just lost their manager - hired them to run the place.
More Information timeline 1974Using money from local investors, Karl Kilian opens Brazos Bookstore in a small space on Bissonnet Street. 1982The University of Houston literary magazine debuts - originally Domestic Crude, it's now called Gulf Coast. Kilian will develop a relationship with the UH writing program, inviting students to stage readings at the store. 1983Kilian helps found the literary nonprofit Inprint, which brings authors to Houston to read at larger venues. 1987When the Menil Collection opens, Kilian operates the museum's bookstore as a satellite location of Brazos. 2006Kilian takes a job at the Menil Collection, forcing them to sell the store. A group of Houstonians bands together to buy Brazos and keep it open.

When they came home to Texas a couple of years later, Kilian - then 29 - decided to open their own bookstore in Houston. They rounded up money by forming a corporation and selling stock to local business people who were willing to invest in a bookstore.
"I thought I'd bring some of the best parts of the New Yorker" bookstore to Texas, Kilian recalls. They wanted a store with cosmopolitan taste - thoughtful journals and magazines, books that celebrated art, architecture and poetry. They didn't have money to advertise, so they hosted store events and readings.
They didn't have the connections to bring in big-name authors, but they had hustle: "You saw a group of people standing on a corner and said, 'Hey, any of you an author? Would you like to have a book party? Come over and read at Brazos Bookstore.' "
It was at least a year before the store hosted a nationally published writer. In 1976, Kilian persuaded Max Apple - who was teaching at Rice - to read stories from "The Oranging of America." Soon after that, the creative writing program started at the University of Houston, attracting acclaimed writers - including Donald Barthelme - who helped bring even more big names to give readings at Brazos.
In 1983, Kilian helped found Inprint, the literary nonprofit that supports the UH writing program and brings in authors for readings in larger venues. When Rich Levy, Inprint's executive director, came to Houston in the mid-'80s, they made a beeline for Brazos Bookstore.
"It wasn't where you went to get the latest Danielle Steel book," Levy said. Kilian preferred to keep their store free of mugs and toys, journals and cards, too.
With its highbrow readings and wares, Brazos built a national reputation, Levy said - which helped Inprint gain clout as well. "When we started going to (BookExpo America) to talk to publishers, our calling card was: 'We're from Houston, where Brazos Bookstore is - and, in fact, they're the bookseller for our reading series.' And then the publisher would talk to us."
But a solid reputation doesn't keep the doors open. When big-box bookstores moved in, peeling customers away with discounted books and fancy coffee, Kilian struggled to keep their independent bookstore alive.
Bookstop, Barnes & Noble and Borders cut into Brazos' sales. It frustrated Kilian to see people come into the store with notepads, writing down titles they planned to buy elsewhere for less. If they were grumpy, he'd approach them: "I would say, 'Here's a bookmark with our address on it. You're not going to find these in Houston. When you realize that, give me a call.' "
The internet brought more competition. When Amazon became a threat in the late '90s, Kilian sent more than one letter to regular customers, asking them to buy books to keep the store afloat.
To stay open, Kilian focused on the strength of a local, independent bookstore: community. They hosted parties, made sure that Brazos was the exclusive seller at book events, and kept bringing in the writers Houstonians wanted to see: Susan Sontag, Tom Wolfe, Gloria Steinem, Larry McMurtry, Grace Paley.
Readings at the store were intimate, just as they are today. Lined up in a few rows of folding chairs, customers could hear and see an author up close. "Some readings, people would be hanging from the rafters," Levy says.
David Sedaris's overflow crowd stood in the parking lot, straining to catch what was being read inside.
Anne Rice had similar drawing power. "It was nearing midnight, and they were still signing books," remembers Dermont. "There were still fans outside, hoping to catch them as they went from the door to a limousine."
Occasionally the store would organize a marathon reading - once for "Of Mice and Men," once for the poetry of Walt Whitman. A marathon reading of "A Lesson Before Dying" brought in author Ernest Gaines, who was scheduled to end the evening by reading the book's last chapter. But the marathon lasted far longer than anyone expected. At 2:30 in the morning, Gaines finally read to the 15 or 20 brave souls who'd waited all night.
Kilian was just as happy to nurture developing writers. "I was always impressed by the willingness to give the reins of the store over to students," Dermont said. The store hosted regular readings for Gulf Coast, the UH student literary journal, and let students sell their work.
In 2006, Kilian took a job as programs director at the Menil Collection, which required them to sell the store. When they couldn't find a buyer, a book-loving group of Houstonians - loyal customers and community leaders - went in together. A decade later, the group still owns the store.
Kilian's spirit lingers there, said Benjamin Rybeck, the store's marketing manager. When Kazuo Ishiguro came to Houston for an Inprint reading last year, the author remembered coming to Brazos early in their career - 25 years and hundreds of readings ago.
"He said, 'I was in Brazos in 1990, when my book came out then. And how is Karl?' " says Rybeck.
In their 2012 novel "The Starboard Sea," Dermont gave their protagonist the middle name Kilian, "just as a tip of the hat" to their friend.
"Karl is intellectually, artistically and spiritually one of the great resources and landmarks of Houston," they said. "There's no one in the world like him; they really are one of the great impresarios."

Normally I talk about how a year zoomed by, but 2017 dragged out way too long. I'll try to keep this short. In no particular order, here are the games I played this year and loved:
I know I spoke about Regency Solitaire the year it came out, and now I'm back on that solitaire kick with Shadowhand, the latest game from Grey Alien. Shadowhand is like regular solitaire, except that I'm battling pirates and thieves, levelling my character's stats, equipping gear that I buy in a marketplace, AND stacking cards that are incrementally higher or lower than the card under them. Yeah. Go try it.
I don't try to pretend I'm good at this game, but I can say it makes 16-hour long flights much more tolerable. Time flies when you're filling in squares one by one to make what you definitely thought was a scorpion but ended up being a chandelier or some shit. It's meditative and perfect for winding down.
It's funny, charming, and gorgeous. Also, one time I tried tapping a single pixel on the screen for MINUTES because I thought it was a “speck of dust” in game collectible, but it turned out to be a god damn speck of real dust on my stupid phone screen. I said a lot of mean things about Ron Gilbert that day. Sorry about that, Ron. Your game's real good.
This deck building roguelike by Hollow Ponds has some of the most unique and beautifully grotesque character design I've ever seen in a game, and the soundtrack/sound design is spot-on for the visuals. The story is delightfully absurd, the backgrounds are drawn by @meowza…it's seriously in my top five roguelikes of all time. The combination of card game and battle mechanics is a thing I really, really love apparently.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU--
You know when the Switch commercials came out and they depicted a bunch of fun looking people in their 30s playing multiplayer games on their Switch with tiny joy cons in public, laughing like it was the purest joy in the world? And we all thought that was ridiculous, because who would ever take out their Switch at a bar at night and start playing games with strangers, and who would find THAT much joy in a party game?
Okay, well, we were wrong, because I am absolutely that guy now.
I have ABSOLUTELY impressed a stranger at a bar by pulling out my Switch and playing this game with them. So, joke's on me. This game is just way too charming to not make you laugh, and the developers are masters of balancing innovating cooperative puzzle solving with friendly teasin-- give it a shot with a cutie. It's a really good date.
You know I have to mention it. I know it's not perfect, and we've all survived a season of microtransaction hell, but listen. I really really love the characters in Destiny, and the environments, and the strike structure. I love my stupid bumblebee shaders and my ramen emote. Plus, I get to listen to Shohreh Aghdashloo and Claudia Black and Cissy Jones all day if I want to. Any game with that is a game worth playing.
Gone Home has a special place in my heart, and Tacoma is absolutely right there with it. I don't want to give anything away, and all my favourite parts of the game are spoilers, but I'll say that even with such a paced, calm play, I experienced exactly the perfect amount of stress and concern for characters that I genuinely felt like I knew at the end of my 4 hour playthrough.
This comes out the day AFTER my top ten list is due, but I'm putting it on here anyway and there's nothing you can do about it. I predict Future Felix I will say that it's very beautiful, and that it's very nice to play it in HD after being promised it for so long, but will also admit that they've never finished the bloody game because it GOES ON FOREVER. I don't actually know anyone who has finished it. Legend says it has no end, it just keeps getting rebooted and HD ported for eternity.
About a month after BotW launched, a friend asked me how much of it I'd played. I thought about it a second, considered I'd only done one of the beast dungeons, but had been running around a lot exploring, so I gave what I thought was an inflated estimate of 7 hours. Then I picked up my Switch and loaded the game, and the clock told me I'd been playing 35 hours. I'd spent 35 hours running around, climbing mountains, finding Koroks, and it had felt like maybe 7. I've now logged about 140 hours of this game and I have no intention of ever completing it. Skyrim came out this year on Switch, and I'm still playing Zelda. I'd say it makes the list.
There were, as always, a ton of games I didn't get to play--I think somehow Phil managed to cover them all, so go check out their list when it's posted. Have a good end of 2017 everyone. Here's hoping 2018 isn't our last. 🍸🍸🍸

Dungeons & Dragons MMO Neverwinter is reportedly coming to PS4 at some stage in the future.
During a Wizards of the Coast livestream (via Dualshockers), associate brand manager Trevor Kidd said the free-to-play title, which is currently only available on Xbox One and PC, will be heading to PlayStation 4.

Up until now there's been no word on a PS4 version of the MMO. We've reached out to developer Cryptic Studios and publisher Perfect World to see if anything official is available. If the news does turn out to be true, Neverwinter will join the PS4's already impressive stable of MMOs, which includes DC Universe Online, Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn and The Elder Scrolls Online.
Neverwinter now has over 1.6 million players on Xbox One, which makes it the console's top free-to-play game of 2015. For more, be sure to check out IGN's Neverwinter Xbox One review.

ObamaCare is in retreat. That much was clear the moment the president started springing B-grade Hollywood references to "blue pills and red pills" in its defense during their news conference last week. But before ObamaCare can be beaten back decisively, its critics need to answer this question: How did their plan for a government takeover of roughly a fifth of the U.S. economy get this far in the first place?
The answer is not that Democrats have a lock on Washington right now—although they do. Nor that Republicans are intellectually bereft—although they are. The answer is that both ObamaCare's supporters and opponents believe that—unlike Europe—America has something called a free market health care system. So long as this myth holds sway, it will be exceedingly difficult to prescribe free market fixes to America's health care woes—or, conversely, end the lure of big government remedies.
The fact of the matter is that America's health care system is like a free market in the same way that Madonna is like a virgin—i.e. in fiction only. If anything, the U.S. system has many more similarities than differences with France and Germany. The only big outlier among European nations is England, which, even in a post-communist world, has managed the impressive feat of hanging on to a socialized, single-payer model. This means that the U.K. government doesn't just pay for medical services but actually owns and operates the hospitals that provide them. English doctors are government employees!
But apart from England, most European countries have a public-private blend, not unlike what we have in the U.S.
The major difference between America and Europe of course is that America does not guarantee universal health insurance whereas Europe does. But this is not as big a deal as it might seem. Uncle Sam, along with state governments, still picks up nearly half of the country's $2.5 trillion annual health care tab.
More importantly, contrary to popular mythology, America does offer public care of sorts. It directly covers about a third of all Americans through Medicare (the public program for the elderly) and Medicaid (the public program for the poor). But it also indirectly covers the uninsured by—at least in part—paying for their emergency care. In effect, anyone in America who does not have private insurance is on the government dole in one way or another.
This is not radically different from France, where the government offers everyone basic public coverage, of course—but a whopping 90% of the French also buy supplemental private insurance to help pay for the 20% to 40% of their tab that the public plan doesn't cover.
Meanwhile, in Germany, about 12.5% of Germans who are civil employees or above a certain income opt out of the public system altogether and rely solely on private coverage—even though they know it is well nigh impossible to return to the public system once they switch. And more Germans likely would go private if they were not legally banned from doing so.
The most striking similarity between America, France and Germany, however, is the model of "insurance" upon which their health care systems are based. In other insurance markets, the more coverage you want, the more you have to pay for it. Consider auto insurance, for instance. If you want everything—from oil changes to collision protection—you'd have to pay more than someone who wants just basic collision protection. That's not how it works in health care.
For the same flat fee—regardless of whether it is paid for primarily through taxes as in France and Germany or through lost wages as in America—patients in all three countries effectively get an ATM card on which they can expense everything (barring co-pays) regardless of what the final tab adds up to. (Catastrophic coverage plans are available in America, but the market is extremely limited for a number of reasons, including the fact that most states have issued Patients Bill of Rights mandating all kinds of fancy benefits even in basic plans.)
Thus, in neither country do patients have much incentive to restrain consumption or shop for cheaper providers. In America and Germany, patients don't even know how much most medical services cost. In France, patients know the prices because they have to pay up front and get reimbursed by their insurer later—a lame attempt to ensure some price consciousness. But since there is no cap on the reimbursed amount, the French sometimes shop for doctors based on such things as office decor rather than prices, according to a study by David Green and Benedict Irvine, researchers at Civitas, a London-based think tank. (Green and Irvine reported this as a good thing.)
So what are the consequences of this "insurance" model and how are the three countries coping with it? America, as Obama continuously reminds us, spends 16% of its gross domestic product on health care—the highest percentage in the world. If current trends persist, in 75 years health care will consume about 50% of the GDP—and all of the federal budget. But France is not doing a whole lot better. Its health care system is the third most expensive in the world with over 11% of its GDP going toward health care—nearly three times more than the amount in 1960. The French fork over more than 20% of their income in taxes for public coverage (and another 2.5% to purchase supplemental private coverage)—yet their public program suffers from chronic deficits. Germany, similarly, spends about 11% of its GDP on health care with Germans contributing more than 15% of their income toward buying health care.
If France and Germany are not spending even more on health care, one big reason is rationing. Universal health care advocates pretend that there is no rationing in France and Germany because these countries don't have long waiting lines for MRIs, surgical procedures and other medical services as in England and Canada. And patients have more or less unrestricted access to specialists.
But it is unclear how long this will last. Struggling with exploding costs, the French government has tried several times—only to back off in the face of a public outcry—to prod doctors into using only standardized treatments. In 1994, it started imposing fines of up to roughly $4,000 on doctors who deviated from "mandatory practice guidelines." It switched from this "sticks" to a "carrots" approach four years later, and tried handing bonuses to doctors who adhered to the guidelines.
Meanwhile, in Germany, "sickness funds"—the equivalent of insurance companies—have imposed strict budgets on doctors for prescription drugs. Doctors who exceed their cap are simply denied reimbursement, something that forces them to prescribe less effective invasive procedures for problems that would have been better treated with drugs. But the most potent form of rationing in France and Germany—and indeed much of Europe—is not overt but covert: delayed access to cutting-edge drugs and therapies that become available to American patients years in advance.
The point is that there is no health care model, whether privately or publicly financed, that can offer unlimited access to medical services while containing costs. Ultimately, such a model arrives at a crossroads where it has to either limit access in an arbitrary way or face uncontrolled cost increases. France and Germany, which are mostly publicly funded, are increasingly marching down the first road. America, which is half publicly and half privately funded, has so far taken the second path. Should America offer even more people such unlimited access through universal coverage, it too will end up rationing care or facing national bankruptcy.
The only sustainable system that avoids this Hobson's choice is one that is based on a genuine free market in which there is some connection between what patients pay for coverage and the services they receive. That is emphatically not what America or any Western country has today. Looking to these countries for solutions, as Obama and other advocates of universal health coverage are doing, will lead to false diagnoses and false cures.

I told myself not to buy any more nail polishes since I already have a million at home. However, after seeing Etude House 2013 Sweet Recipe Ice Cream Nails collection, I just can't stop myself. I got #1 Mint Chocolate Chip. Look at the bottle! It's an ice cream cone! How can you not get it? When I went to Etude House, there were only the mint green and yellow lemon left. I don't really like yellow, so I just got the green. I wanted to get the pink strawberry, but there are no stock.Here, I have applied 2 coats of it. I like the brush. It's just the right size. Not to long, not too short. Not too thin, not too fat. It makes even application. The consistency is also just right for the glitter to distribute evenly. This reminds me of the Whimsical that Cho got before. However, this one is much better as it only needs 2 coats. The Whimsical needs a million coats in order to see its color.
When you find yourself running a terminal command that you don't know how to exit from. Don't just close the whole terminal, you can close the that command!
If you want to force quit “kill” a running command, you can use “Ctrl + C”. most of the applications running from the terminal will be forced to quit.
There's commands/apps that are designed to keep running until the user asks it to end. and there's other commands/apps that are designed to show the output and exit automatically.
Here's how to stop 3 of the most common commands.
Nano Editor
Nano is a simple text editor, you could have faced it when dealing with “git commit”.
If you're inside nano editor. Press “Ctrl + X” to exit. it will prompt you whether you want to save before quitting or not.
Vim Editor
Vim is another text editor, unlike nano, this one is sophisticated and powerful one.
If you were running Vim editor and you want to quit, you can press “Esc” then type a colon “:” followed by “q!” to force quit without saving.
If you want to save do the same process but replace “q!” with “wq” (which means write then quit).
Less
Less is a command that let you view the content of an input (either the output of another command or a content of a file).
Less is different from the editors above, if you're inside commands that don't need input, like “less” or top, you can press “q”.
Others
Sometimes nothing from the above will work to quit the command gracefully. In these situations, you can use the “kill” command which is “Ctrl + C”.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday U.S. intervention in Syria would be “a disaster for the region”, the ISNA state news agency reported, as Western powers made plans to hit Damascus over a chemical weapons attack.
After supporting Arab uprisings across the Middle East and north Africa in 2011 as examples of what Khamenei called an Islamic awakening, Tehran has steadfastly supported the secular President Bashar al-Assad, its main strategic ally in the Middle East, against a two-and-a-half-year-long rebellion.
“The intervention of America will be a disaster for the region. The region is like a gunpowder store and the future cannot be predicted,” the agency quoted Khamenei as saying.
Iran is concerned that if Assad were overthrown, they would be replaced by either allies of the West or by radical Sunni Muslims tied to Saudi Arabia, both seen as hostile by the Shi'ite Muslim Iranians. Syria is also a conduit for Iranian supplies to Shi'ite Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.
Iranian officials have condemned the use of chemical weapons - deployed against its troops during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war - but have blamed Syrian rebels for the August 21 poison gas attack that killed hundreds in the embattled suburbs of Damascus.
“As a victim of chemical weapons the Islamic Republic of Iran does not tolerate the use of such weapons. In addition, it also does not tolerate a group of countries giving themselves the permission to wage a campaign in the region,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state television.
“This fire of sectarianism, tribal conflicts, and conflicts that ... are exacerbated for short-term interests cannot be restricted to one region. “If (Obama) gets stuck in this trap, they will certainly leave behind bad memories of their presidency.”
Joe Cole's frustrating descent to bit-part player
Mark Segal @segalmark
“When you're older, you'll be able to tell your grandchildren you were at Upton Park the day Joe Cole signed their first professional contract.”
West Ham PA announcer, 1998
“Lionel Messi can do some amazing things but, anything they can do, Joe can do as well, if not better.”
Steven Gerrard, August 2010
Still regarded by many as the most gifted player England has produced since Paul Gascoigne, hype is something Joe Cole has had to live with for a very long time.
This is the man parts of England's World Cup squad almost went to war with Fabio Capello over last summer, and someone who can look in their trophy cabinet and see at least three Premier Leagues and two FA Cup winners medals gleaming back at him, along with more than 50 England caps.
But while this time last year, Cole was seen as the saviour of England's dismal World Cup campaign, this summer they are contemplating a backward step. A move away from one of England's biggest clubs and into the second, or maybe even third, tier of Premier League sides.
So how has it come to this and what does it say about the development of English football that a player so gifted, and not yet even 30, is now being ignored and marginalised by some of the game's top managers?
Cole has grown up as a footballer directly in the public eye perhaps a result of having the neither shy nor retiring Harry Redknapp as their first manager.
Even when Cole was a young teenager, they were talked up by Redknapp, who would let it be known Sir Alex Ferguson was a big admirer and willing to offer big money or big names to take the Islington-born youngster to Old Trafford.
Not that Cole needed any hyping from their manager. They were clearly a special talent from a very young age and they and Michael Carrick were the star turns in a West Ham youth side that thrashed Coventry 9-0 over two legs in the 1999 Youth Cup final.
But while Carrick was built by the Hammers academy as a latter-day Trevor Brooking, all controlled passing and midfield authority, Cole was quite different.
They had flicks and tricks but with a purpose. They would drop a shoulder and take players on, play incisive one-twos and create chances. They would also score goals. Cole didn't have enough power to shoot from the edge of the box, but that would come with age.
By January 1999, they were ready for their West Ham debut in an FA Cup tie against Swansea and, at the end of that month, Redknapp took great delight in showing off their prize possession during West Ham's trip to Manchester United.
Cole's progression was rapid and they were soon a regular fixture in the West Ham side. Redknapp's preferred tactics of attacking the opposition suited their play and they quickly became a fan favourite.
But while adored in East London, to many others Cole was seen as a luxury player and one who couldn't be trusted.
This was a view reinforced in March 2002, when Cole, now an established international, gave the ball away in a dangerous area to allow Vincenzo Montella to score for Italy in a game England lost 2-1. Cole went on to play a minimal role in that summer's World Cup.
To those who watched them every week at Upton Park, the luxury label was unfair, but it stuck. I was in an England press box when a journalist kept shouting “give us another trick, Joe” as Cole and the rest of the side struggled.
Their final season at West Ham should have proved the doubters wrong once and for all. Despite big names around him, such as Paolo Di Canio, Fredi Kanoute and David James, Cole was named captain and worked tirelessly to try to keep the struggling Hammers up.
There was nothing luxurious about the way they battled away in central midfield in a relegation fight the Hammers ultimately lost. And with the drop came Cole's departure to Chelsea. They were clearly too good for the Championship
Free from the shackles of a relegation dogfight, and surrounded by quality players, Cole was the right age and in the right environment to flourish.
Their Stamford Bridge career began under Claudio Ranieri, who appeared a good fit for Cole's natural talent. But lack of silverware led to the Italian's removal and, while the incoming José Mourinho proved good for Chelsea, they proved a disaster for Cole and England.
Mourinho is a control freak. Granted, a hugely successful one, but a control freak nonetheless. Despite sitting on the touchline, they like to be in control on the pitch and that means having players who follow their instructions to the letter.
They appear to distrust players who think for themselves and are unpredictable. At Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo is perhaps the first Mourinho player granted a free rein. But, rewarded with more than 50 goals last season, the coach can afford to make an exception. Cole, by contrast, was denied a free pass.
While Mourinho will point to the success Cole enjoyed under them at Stamford Bridge, they stripped the flair from the player and built them into a bog-standard wide midfielder.
For an easy comparison, look at pictures of the wiry, fleet-footed Cole who broke into the West Ham team with the bulked-up sturdy version who eventually left Chelsea in 2010. Of course, over the years Cole was bound to grow but, under Mourinho, their physicality changed and it affected their game.
Mourinho's desire to play 4-3-3 also meant Cole was marginalised on the left-wing. While the likes of Frank Lampard, Claude Makélelé and Michael Essien would patrol the centre, Cole was directed to attack and defend along a narrow strip of the pitch, making sure they were always on hand to aid Ashley Cole should the opposition attack.
Defend first, then think about attacking a methodology completely at odds with how Cole should have been used.
While Cole was picking up trophies with the Blues, the fact they were having their natural flair coached out of them failed to register with the media and fans. Where it was clearly noticeable was with England, where supporters could not rely on Roman Abramovich's millions to buy star players for them.
By rights, Cole should have been a sensation in an England shirt. Their ability to open up tight defences would have been a huge asset at international level, but they were never entrusted entirely with the responsibility in a similar vein to creative gems Glenn Hoddle and Matthew Le Tissier before him.
Virtually unused at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004, Cole, along with the rest of England's “Golden Generation”, was due to come of age in Germany in 2006. Sadly, it wasnt to be.
With a stunning volley against Sweden, they were arguably England's best player in the group stages. But as the tournament progressed, Cole's influence diminished and their World Cup came to a disappointing end when they were substituted minutes after Wayne Rooney was sent off in the quarter-final against Portugal.
Four years later in South Africa, Cole was once again a peripheral figure in coach Capello's plans. After opening draws against the United States and Algeria, there was a national outcry for them to be included in the vital game against Slovenia. Chelsea team-mate John Terry went so far as to call for their inclusion in a press conference, a move that clearly challenged Capello's authority.
But sadly, by then, the Joe Cole who fans, the media and team-mates were demanding had long gone.
The tricky midfield dynamo with a dozen tricks up their sleeve, the player who would move spectators slightly closer to the edge of their seats when they received the ball, was no longer there. By 2010, Cole was just another in a long line of so-so left-sided midfielders who would do a job, but would not be expected to change the game.
Capello clearly understood what Cole had become and refused to bend to the will of media, keeping Cole on the bench until 20 minutes from time. They performed a similar role in the second-round defeat to Germany, to date Cole's last England appearance.
Cole's brief performances in South Africa came as an unattached player after Chelsea had refused to meet new contract demands and let their existing deal expire.
By the end of their time at Stamford Bridge, Cole was far from a regular. Injuries hampered their attempts to impress Carlo Ancelotti but, even when fit, the Italian chose to put their trust in the likes of Florent Malouda.
Despite brief interest from Redknapp, now at Tottenham, and rumours of a homecoming to West Ham, Cole decided their future lay with Liverpool.
The signing was portrayed as a great coup for new boss Roy Hodgson and with the likes of Reds captain Gerrard comparing them favourably to Lionel Messi, Cole was clearly rated by their team-mates.
But their first, and possibly only, season at Anfield proved a disaster. Sent off in their first game and then struck down by injury, by the time Cole was ready to resume, Liverpool were a club in crisis.
They rarely featured under new boss Kenny Dalglish and, with the rebuilding signs up around the Liverpool squad this summer, it looks as though Cole could be sacrificed.
They only turns 30 this November, but it seems Cole's career has peaked and it's only downhill from here. They have been linked with yet another reunion with Redknapp, but if that doesn't come off, then Fulham or Queens Park Rangers are also mooted as possible destinations.
No offence to the two West London clubs but, by this stage of their career, Cole should be a regular feature in a title-winning side built around him.
So what went wrong?
Well, Mourinho must shoulder some blame for changing Cole as a player. During seven years at Chelsea, they went from midfield maverick to steady left-winger – a description which clearly doesn't shout progress.
But Cole must also take some blame. Maybe they were never as good as we all thought. Maybe the excitement that caused the Upton Park PA announcer to talk so highly about them all those years ago was just hype.
Cole was clearly a class apart against players their own age but. when it came to the Premier League, maybe they didn't have the tools to stand out on a consistent basis.
Perhaps the failure to marry the tactical discipline required by Mourinho with Cole's natural creativity is more the fault of player than manager.
Or maybe it's something different. Maybe there is just no room for the flair player in English football today.
Manchester United won the title last season with a functional side, while despite Roman Abramovich's desire to see Chelsea play exciting, attacking football, they are still most comfortable in the tactical straightjacket imposed in Mourinho's day.
Even Arsenal, the standard bearers for the type of passing football Cole would revel in, do not have a standout player. Cesc Fabregas and Jack Wilshere are clearly the best of the bunch, but are they exciting to watch? Is there a hush in the crowd or a rumbling of excitement when they get the ball?
Perhaps the only modern player comparable to what Cole could have been is Messi. Nurtured by Barcelona, and able to marry attacking verve with tactical responsibility, they have made their small size a virtue and is rightly seen as the best player in the world.
Could the young Joe Cole have developed into an English version of the great Argentinian? Possibly, possibly not. Sadly, we will never find out.

Disney has a "very carefully designed marketing plan" to get consumers excited about the Star Wars franchise this year, CEO Bob Iger said today during an earnings call. And it includes a tantalizing video game tease.
"We have already talked about some games that will come out into the marketplace," Iger said. "EA had an announcement at Star Wars Celebration, for instance. You can expect that there will be more game-related activity between now and the release [of Star Wars: The Force Awakens]."
In May 2013, Disney and Electronic Arts signed an exclusive deal for certain Star Wars games. The first game born of that that partnership will be Star Wars Battlefront, which is in development at Battlefield studio EA DICE and scheduled for a Nov. 17 release. The 10-year deal, which will not focus on movie tie-ins, also encompasses Battlefield Hardline and Dead Space developer Visceral Games. Last year, Naughty Dog veteran and Uncharted series creative director Amy Hennig joined Visceral to work on the studio's unannounced Star Wars game.
Must Read First details on Star Wars Battlefront, the new shooter from the Battlefield team
Video games are just one component in Disney's larger strategy to market its $4.1 billion Lucasfilm acquisition. To Lucasfilm's new owner, marketing is not just about fostering interest in the most notable new development — Star Wars: The Force Awakens will hit theaters Dec. 18 — but in Star Wars as a whole.
Disney knew that Star Wars was popular when it bought the franchise from George Lucas in late 2012, but Iger said today that the company underestimated fan demand for the galaxy far, far away.
"I will say, we've been overwhelmed with interest," they said. "We knew when we purchased this that there was great interest and value, but so far, it has well exceeded our expectations."
As an example, they cited interest in the two teaser trailers for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Earlier in the call, Iger said that the second trailer received more than 88 million views in its first 24 hours. To date, it has more than 200 million views.
Iger said that Disney is mindful of several complementary components. Those include old fans, new fans and markets like China, which is now the "number 2 movie market in the world," Iger said, but was barely a factor when the last series movie, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, was released in 2005. That understanding helped shape what they called Disney's "deliberate" marketing strategy. And it's already underway.
Iger used the recent worldwide downloadable releases of the first six-Star Wars movies as an example of Disney's deliberate rollout. The recently announced release of The Force Awakens merchandise, which will happen on what the company is calling "Force Friday," Sept. 4, is another part, the CEO said.
"I think generally, you're going to see us release, in a very careful way, certain elements of the film as part of a very carefully designed marketing plan, again as we get much closer to the film," they said.
Though Iger didn't mention them, part of the Star Wars strategy includes the Aftermath series of novels. Set to debut in September, the trilogy will chronicle the events after Return of the Jedi and fill in the blanks between that film and The Force Awakens. Star Wars Rebels, an animated series, premiered on DisneyXD last year.
The strategy extends far beyond 2015. Iger pointed out that, in the next two years — between now and May 2017 — Disney and Lucasfilm will release three live-action feature films: Episode VII this December, the spin-off Anthology film Star Wars: Rogue One in December 2016 and the untitled Episode VIII in May 2017.
Iger's constant characterization of deliberateness can also be viewed as a reaction to previous Star Wars marketing strategies. Again, they didn't mention them directly, but their comments did address a situation that Disney doesn't want to create.
"We also want to be careful"
Back when it was an independent company, Lucasfilm's marketing strategy for Episode I - The Phantom Menace in 1999 was enormous, as images from the movie adorned Taco Bell restaurants as well as Frito-Lay and Pepsi products, just to name a few. Lucasfilm did less canvassing with subsequent releases. The marketing campaign for Episode II - Attack of the Clones in 2002, for example, was deliberately more subdued, which was widely viewed as a course correction and an acknowledgment that the company had unintentionally supersaturated the marketplace with The Phantom Menace.
"We are managing all of this with great care, as well, in that, while we are mindful of the fact that we have to market this and go after this new generation and new territories, we also want to be careful that the demand does not create almost — " Iger paused for a moment to collect their thoughts. "Too much in the marketplace too soon.
"So everything that we have done to date has been deliberate, and we have an extremely carefully constructed and deliberate plan going forward, in terms of what we roll out in the marketplace and in terms of product and in terms of marketing."
Insanely dumb characters are the bread and butter of FXX's programming. (The extra "X" is either for extra xomedy, or it's just a stutter.) And though all the characters on both It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia and The League have repeatedly proven themselves to be both socially and intellectually stupid, each show does have a stupidity All-Star: Charlie (Charlie Day) of Sunny is a special kind of idiot born from a life of spray paint huffing and head injuries, while The League's Taco (Jonathan Lajoie) has slowed their brain to a crawl via copious consumption of marijuana and what seems to be the word's most friction-free lifestyle.
This week, both of these broken minds get fixed, if only temporarily. On Sunny, Charlie becomes the subject of a scientific experiment, was given "smart pills," and turned into a "genius." On The League, Taco loses their weed stash, forcing them into sobriety, and returning them to normal levels of intelligence. The question is: which show did it better?
Who Did It First?
It feels unfair, as both episodes premiered last night, October 23rd, but It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia airs thirty minutes ahead of The League, giving Sunny the "W."
Winner: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
Which Show's Dumb Character Got Smarter Than The Other's?
If you only watched the first twenty-five minutes of each episode, you might believe that Charlie made the bigger jump in intelligence. Early in the episode, they prove themselves to be dumber than a lab rat, but after taking the "smart pills," he's able to become fluent in Mandarin in just two days. But in the last five minutes of Sunny we find out Charlie's new intelligence is all an illusion. So Taco, who goes from being an out-of-it pothead to a person of average intelligence, takes it by a technicality.
Winner: The League.
Who Created A Better Mechanism To Make A Dumb Character Smarter?
Sunny created a "magic pill" to improve Charlie's intellect, which really worried me while watching it. Before this week, the Sunny universe was more or less the same as our own in terms of what is scientifically possible, but if there are magical smart pills in the world of the show, then its writers have free range to introduce anything they want regardless of plausibility -- a dangerous precedent. (As it turned out, my worries were premature, as we will see below.)
The League just removed marijuana, the obstacle preventing Taco from achieving normal intelligence. It is simple and true to the reality of the show and its characters, and also allowed Taco to get smarter without losing their personality. They were still Taco, just more fazed by life.
Winner: The League.
Which Character Proved Their New Intelligence In Funnier Ways?
Charlie not only learns Mandarin in two days, but also starts using Shakespeare quotes to complain about a War & Peace manuscript they start carrying around and solving complex mathematic equations. Listening to both Beethoven and Mandarin on two different sets of headphones exclaims, Charlie exclaims, "I just realized that I have two ears so it's a waste to only listen to one thing." The obvious response: "You just realized you have two ears?"
Taco just realizes how ugly the rest of their friends are, and creates an equation about the world's supply of boners: apparently, it is a universal constant.
Winner: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
Which Ensemble Reacted Better To The Loss Of Its Idiot?
The gang from Sunny begins huffing gasoline, bringing their collective IQ down even further. With Charlie off doing "smart" stuff, the rest of the gang have to kill their own rats. I love Dennis's (Glenn Howerton) plan: they lay out some brie and plays some mood music in order to entice the rat into a glue trap ("It's not about brute force. It's about seduction"). Frank (Danny DeVito) is possibly the most effected by Charlie's new intelligence. Now unable to enjoy their Gruesome Twosome Tuesday of Mongolian Barbecue and a Police Academy sequel, Frank seems truly saddened by the loss of their better half.
The fantasy football league first enjoys a little schadenfreude at the discomfort Taco feels outside of their cocoon of THC, but eventually, inconvenienced by Taco's new intellect, the league "dehabs" Taco, returning them to their former stupidity.
Winner: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
Who Created A Better Return To Normal?
The reveal of the Sunny episode is that the experiment is measuring how much of an asshole one becomes when they are told they are very smart. The smart pills turn out to be placebos; the scientists have only been pretending that Charlie has become a genius. The scientific breakthrough Charlie has been working on since they began taking the placebos is a box that allows cats to talk to spiders (based on the scientific principle of "9 + 9 = box, and that's where the cat goes!"). The scientists' findings: someone told they are a genius becomes obnoxiously arrogant. To which Mac (Rob McElhenny) responds, "You stupid science bitches couldn't even make my friend smarter!" I am so happy they figured out a great way of getting around the "magic pill" problem.
The guys in The League abduct Taco off the street and force them to smoke weed, despite their protests, which feels more like a Rafi (Jason Mantzoukas) move than one the core group would make.
Winner: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
Who Wrote It Better?
The League was not bad, but Sunny really nailed this premise. It was actually penned by Game Of Thrones writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, and if this is the result, I am all for having more guest writers on the show.
Winner: It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.
Over the following decade, as the country descended into civil war, faced the loss of Abraham Lincoln, and began the project of Reconstruction, The Atlantic put its founding principles to the test, covering the Civil War era with an overt and consistent abolitionist bent but also presenting a variety of perspectives on the contentious period.
The impending national conflict made no appearance in the magazine's first issue, but abolitionist reformer Edmund Quincy faced it head on in the second. In “Where Will It End?” they issued an emphatic critique of slavery, denigrating the South for its moral and cultural failings and calling on Northerners to make a forceful stand for freedom.
Three years later, in October 1860, founding editor James Russell Lowell penned and published a ringing endorsement for Abraham Lincoln's presidential candidacy in “The Election in November.” Though they hailed Lincoln as a “statesman” and praised them for their “ability” and “integrity,” Lowell's expression of support was contextual rather than personal, rooted in a fierce, and clearly voiced, opposition to slavery.
Lowell returned to the pages of The Atlantic mere months later, after Confederate soldiers started the war by firing on Union forces at Fort Sumter, to detail the opening salvos of the conflict and decry the Confederate Rebellion in “The Pickens-and-Stealin's Rebellion.” They framed the young Civil War in the same moral terms as they had the election in November, asserting: “We cannot think that the war we are entering on can end without some radical change in the system of African slavery.”
Ralph Waldo Emerson, one of the magazine's founders, lent their own voice to the abolitionist cause in April 1862's “American Civilization.” From the time of their presidential campaign, President Lincoln had prioritized national unity and called only for the containment, rather than the end, of slavery in the United States. But in a lecture at the Smithsonian Institution, in conversations with Lincoln himself, and, finally, in the pages of The Atlantic, Emerson argued, like Lowell, that slavery was central to the war, and asserted that emancipation was both a moral imperative and the only means of ending the conflict once and for all.
Less than six months later, on September 22, 1862, Lincoln declared in the aftermath of the Battle of Antietam:
On the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforth, and forever free.
In “The President's Proclamation,” published in our November 1862 issue, Emerson applauded the pronouncement. Emancipation, they reiterated, was the war's real moral purpose, and the proclamation would assure that “the lives of our heroes have not been sacrificed in vain.”

AFTER a year of bloody campaigns, infringements on human rights and accusations of authoritarianism, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen seem like unlikely candidates to be included in a shortlist of nominees for a peace prize.
But the 2017 Confucius Peace Prize, labelled the Chinese alternative to the Nobel Peace Prize, has selected the two Southeast Asian leaders for this year's award.
Awarded by a private company, the Confucius awards have courted controversy since their foundation in 2010. Originally set up under the Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts in China, then-chairperson Tan Changliu claimed the award existed to “promote world peace from an Eastern perspective.”

But the award has since been banned by China's Culture Ministry, forcing the organisers to relocate to Hong Kong.
The renamed China International Peace Research Center has presented the award to a string of authoritarian political figures who favour a pro-Beijing stance.

In 2015, the recipient was former Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who was accused of a “litany of human rights abuses” over their 37-year term. The organiser cited their “contribution to peace in Africa,” but the award drew widespread international criticism. Mugabe declined to accept the award, which comes with US$15,000 prize money.
Other winners include Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, former Cuba's president Fidel Castro, and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

Both Duterte and Hun Sen have had a tumultuous year for home politics.
Duterte has been accused by rights groups of “crimes against humanity” for their bloody drug war that resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings – including several children – by the Philippine National Police. They have also imprisoned political opponents – namely Senator Leila De Lima – who voiced criticism, admitted to murder, and threatened to execute police officers.
Hun Sen has also overseen the dissolution of the only credible opposition party in the country, carried out a crackdown on press freedom, imprisoned the opposition leader, and shuttered organisations that voice anti-government sentiment.
The winners are announced in early December.
Voting is now underway to elect a new federal NDP leader, with the winner to be announced next month.
CBC News Network's Power & Politics has interviewed each of the four remaining candidates to see where they'll take the party in the approach to the 2019 election.
Charlie Angus
The MP for Timmins-James Bay in Northern Ontario says he'll pursue laws to cap greenhouse gas emissions coming from companies:
"I come from mining country. Nobody ever cleaned up Sudbury without legislation. Behind my property, there's a lake that's been polluted for over 100 years. They stopped dumping arsenic and heavy metals in lakes because of legislation. What we need to do is say 'What is the cap we need to meet?' [Then] we legislate it, we work with industry …. You legislate the limits, then you establish a mandate of experts who can look at this."
'I know I ruffled some feathers and that makes some people uncomfortable,' the NDP leader hopeful says. 8:09
Niki Ashton
Ashton, who represents the federal Manitoba riding of Churchill–Keewatinook Aski, says they want the federal government to invest in stable, year-long work for young people while raising taxes on large corporations and making new tax brackets for top earners.
"What we've proposed here is the need for fair taxation. That means those who have more pay more. Canada used to be a lot more equitable in terms of the tax system we used to have, then in the '90s that started going off the rails. What we've proposed is looking at some of what we used to do, including raising corporate tax rates to 21 per cent, which was the pre-Harper level."
'If we're going to talk about tackling inequality, tax reform is a big part of that,' says the NDP leadership candidate. 8:08
Guy Caron
​Guy Caron says the NDP would pour $30 billion to $35 billion into a basic income policy paid for by a tax reform package focusing on the wealthy if the MP for Rimouski-Neigette–Témiscouata–Les Basques is elected leader.
"We have to acknowledge that Canada is one of the countries that taxes wealth the least. It's also well known that our income inequality is increasing faster: $30 to $35 billion may look big, but you have to put it in context. The Liberals came into government with a balanced budget, now they're $28 billion in deficit [as of the last federal budget] with very little to show for it. I'm proposing basically $30 billion to eliminate poverty and face future challenges."
NDP leadership candidate Guy Caron discusses the race, what they bring to the contest and their chances of winning. 6:44
Jagmeet Singh
The representative for Bramalea–Gore–Malton in the Ontario legislature says their environmental policy favours any project that respects Indigenous rights, climate change goals and local priorities — so while he's against Energy East and Kinder Morgan, he's not a hard "no" on all pipelines.
"We need to make investments in the future, in projects that are going to help us build a sustainable economy. If we can meet the criteria for a sustainable economy, building something that's sustainable for the future, I'd support it. If it doesn't meet those criteria, I don't think it makes sense for our country."
There's always a Shakespeare film adaptation or two in the pipeline. Sometime later this year Michael Almereyda's Cymbeline will be released, and Justin Kurzel's Macbeth with Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard is slated for 2015. Now there's another low-budget, independent version of Macbeth in the works from veteran bit player Vincent Regan, whose credits include 300, Troy, and BBC's Shakespeare Re-Told series.

Regan has turned to Kickstarter in order to raise the $250,000 to cover preproduction costs, but the real story is the cast the first-time director has been able to pull together, at least for the 8-minute proof-of-concept excerpted in the Kickstarter trailer. Enemy Of Man will inadvertently grant Ned Stark a chance for vengeance upon House Lannister, as Sean Bean plays the doomed Scottish Lord, while fellow Game Of Thrones veteran Charles Dance takes the role of King Duncan. If the film comes to fruition, it will add to the litany of projects where Bean's death is an inevitability—but at the very least, it will also grant fans of House Stark a brief moment of victory.
Though there's no Lady Macbeth announced yet (though Michelle Fairley must be wrapping up the new season of 24 sometime soon), the rest of the cast includes James D'Arcy (Cloud Atlas) as Banquo, Jason Flemyng (X-Men: First Class, Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels) as Macduff, and Harry Potter's Rupert Grint as Ross. You know, Ross, that one Scottish thane, the unforgettable marquee role after Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Macduff, Banquo, and the Witches.
AVERAGE household water bills could be slashed by up to $100 a year as a result of a decision to mothball the state's $1.8 billion Port Stanvac desalination plant.
After revealing yesterday it would place the plant on "standby" from 2015, SA Water acknowledged that the independent regulator could demand that the $100 million annual savings be passed on to the organisation's million customers.
The Essential Services Commission of South Australia is currently deciding how much revenue SA Water will be allowed to earn from 2013 to 2016 and chairperson Paul Kerin confirmed the utility would not need as much revenue without the desalination plant.
"Any cost-saving will result in a lower revenue requirement," they said. Acting Water Minister Michael O'Brien said the government would push for cheaper water.
"Now that SA Water has said that they believe cheaper water is available - it is expected that ESCOSA will set a lower maximum revenue and the government will demand that SA Water passes on any savings," Mr O'Brien said.
SA Water customers will still have to pay for the $1.8 billion construction cost.
This has already been factored in to water bills since 2008.
SA Water chief executive John Ringham said the cost of running the desalination plant was around $130 million a year, but on standby would be $30 million.
The plant is expected to begin producing water for consumers from next year.
SA Water would not commit to a cut in water bills but a spokesperson acknowledged ESCOSA could demand that the $100 million saving be wiped off SA Water's revenue for each year the plant was mothballed.
Reaction to the announcement yesterday led to the first tweet by Isobel Redmond since their ill-fated announcement, and then backflip, that 35,000 public service jobs would be cut if the Liberals were to win the next election. "Labor's desal disaster," they tweeted, linking to a written statement.
"South Australians were told that future water price rises would be restricted to CPI.
"Today SA Water reveals that it cannot afford to run the desalination plant without price rises in excess of CPI," the statement read.
SA Water had cited the promise to keep water prices at close to inflation in coming years as the reason for the policy shift.
"To keep costs down for our customers, SA Water is planning to use our lower-cost water sources first, which will mean placing the desalination plant in standby mode when these cheaper sources are available," SA Water chief executive John Ringham said.
"Improved inflows into the River Murray and Mount Lofty catchments have put us in a position where we can utilise these sources first and we are anticipating that the desalination plant may not need to be operated in the upcoming regulatory period (2013 to 2016) after the completion of its 24-month warranty."
SA Water has the Essential Services Commission of South Australia to approve the plan, which will mean the desalination plant, which was to supply half of Adelaide's water supply, will be put on "standby" as soon as it completes a two-year "warranty" running period in 2015.
The cost of Murray water is around one tenth of desalinated water and an SA Water spokesperson said the plant would now only be used if and when another drought began.
When matching a Liberal Party policy to build the desalination plant in 2006, the State Government said that it was essential to stop Adelaide's dependence on the then drought-stricken Murray.
But flooding rains in NSW, Victoria and Queensland have since returned the river system to health, despite long-term over-allocation of water.
MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN?
South Australians were stuck with desalination as a solution to reliance on the Murray when the State Government stole a 2007 Liberal Party policy to build a plant.
"The time for talk is well and truly over. The time is here now for governments to commit to tangible projects that deliver the extra water Adelaide and the rest of SA needs," then Opposition Leader Iain Evans said launching the policy.
The Liberals' desalination plant was to cost $400 million but the State Government version ended up costing $1.8 billion.
In 2009 then-premier Mike Rann said the plant was needed so that water restrictions in Adelaide could be lifted, a problem which was later solved before the desalination plant came online.
Mr Rann declared, "this will be the biggest capital works project ever seen in the state's history".
The economic benefit to the state was to be $2.8 billion through jobs and better water security, Parliament was told.
Then water minister Karlene Maywald said: "But what this is about is guaranteeing our water security for the future".
Standing outside a strip mall in Springfield, I pull on the handle of the double-deadbolted door of a storefront with dark windows and a paper green arrow that says “Herbs” hanging under the company sign, but it doesn't budge.
I can hear men inside talking and laughing, so I give a knock and stare straight into the camera above the door, hoping there's something in my face that will let the bouncer know I'm cool. Nothing. Do I need to know a secret knock?
I'm at a “club” named for the lyrics in an iconic Rick James song at 5:30 p.m. on a Wednesday because I got word that if you pay a cover charge at this place, you leave with a free gift of marijuana or cannabis-infused chocolate.
The sun is setting and a couple of men are standing outside waiting with me now. A friendly man with facial tattoos gets in line and tells us the club only lets a few people in at a time. After waiting around for five minutes, a few people leave the club, and three men and I go inside.
Right now in Massachusetts you can walk into a storefront, plunk down $50, and walk out with an eighth of weed — all you have to be is 21 or older. No medical card required.
This may sound like you can legally buy weed — and before the first marijuana retail licenses are issued, too — but the people handing out buds are adamant that this is not what's going on.
Since legal recreational marijuana went into effect in Massachusetts on Dec. 15, 2016 across the state, cannabis enthusiasts have been finding ways around the state's laws to make money off weed before licensed retailers open in 2018. Up until the state issues licenses and provides a start date for legal sale of recreational pot, people age 21 and older in Massachusetts can possess and use marijuana for funsies, but they can't buy it.
It is, however, legal to gift weed in quantities under an ounce.
So, people aren't selling weed — they're selling experiences and cheap items that come with free pot gifts. You know, if the customer is into that sort of thing. Another work-around is to rent space to a customer, like a locker, then fill that space with gifted weed.
“These types of businesses are popping up all around … This is not an abnormal thing,” says Marvin Cole, a Northampton lawyer specializing in marijuana law. “For the ones that are doing it, it's unclear what's legal or illegal.”
At the club in Springfield, about five of us stand in a line partitioned off by black stanchions from the rest of the space. The room is sparsely stocked: the floor is a cement gray and the walls are lined with some seriously sick bright and funky hoodies. There are some display cases, like you see in jewelry stores, across from where we wait that contain knitted caps, vape pens, vape juice, huge cone rolling papers, and some cannabis pipes.
At the front of the line behind the counter is one man in a gray sweatshirt running the cash-only register. Behind them is a handwritten sign with six strains of marijuana listed on it. Two are crossed out — they're crowd favorites — and all of them claim to be 19 percent THC or higher. Another man in a gray T-shirt ducks out from behind a black curtain behind the counter carrying armfuls of plastic medicine bottles prepackaged with pot.
“For anyone who hasn't been here before,” says the man at the register, “I want you to know that we don't sell weed. If you leave here with nothing else, leave with knowing we do not sell weed. But …”
They explain that the place I am in is like a club. There is a “cover charge” to get in: $20 for basic admission and $50 for VIP. With the $20 admission, you can select a free gram from any of the available strains or get a cannabis-infused chocolate bar. For $50, you can choose three grams.
A woman who appears to be in their 60s is in front of me with their teenage son who translates for them with the cashier. They pay the basic cover, reaching into their wallet with hands that look like they're aching with arthritis and heads out with a brown bag and one gram of Granddaddy Purple Haze.
With the cashier now, I try to chat them up. They've been open one month, they say, and it's been nothing but busy. I make my purchase then consider hanging out at the club for a while, but no one else does — there's no music and nowhere to sit — so I take my unmarked brown paper bag and head out.
Once home I realize I have been gifted a chunk of cannabis-chocolate in the bottom of my bag. Calls from the Advocate seeking comment from the club's owner or manager were not returned.
How much of a risk pot club owners face is hard to tell, says Dick Evans, a Northampton attorney and winner of a lifetime achievement award from NORML, a pro-marijuana advocacy group. He's not aware of anyone being charged in connection with this type of scheme. Part of the law voters approved on Nov. 8 specifically bans exchanges in which people try to skirt the law by selling cheap items for crazy high prices and then stuffing them with “free” weed. But this piece of the law is yet to be challenged in court and there is a wrinkle to it: there can be no remuneration of marijuana if it is advertised to the public. So does that mean as long as someone doesn't take out a TV commercial to sell cannabis, the whole “club” thing is okay?
“The law is clear,” says Evans, “that the delivery of marijuana can't be part of a promotional thing. In Chapter 7 of the new law, section A4, it says you can't be punished for giving away or giving remuneration under an ounce of marijuana as long as the transfer is not advertised to the public.”
Evans says he's also noticed a proliferation of marijuana retailers who, wink, aren't marijuana retailers. What's most interesting about this new business, Evans says, is that things seem to be going smoothly.
“Commerce is exploding and the sky is not falling,” Evans says. “I haven't heard of any actual threats of harm to the public health or safety as a result of people exercising their new liberty.”
The state doesn't seem to have the eradication of pseudo pot retailers high on the to-do list. January brought news that a man going by the name Corey Hampton was selling plastic sandwich bags — for $325 each — on Craigslist. Each bag came with a free ounce of weed. Thus far, it seems, he's still in business despite having their activities trumpeted by the Boston Globe, the Associated Press, and NPR.
The federal government may take a different stance. Before Trump was elected president, Obama had issued a policy of not interfering with well-run, state-sanctioned medical or recreational marijuana businesses. Will Trump and attorney general Jeff Sessions feel the same way?
“Overall, there's not as much risk as there has been in the past,” Cable says. “Who knows how the new AG is going to treat marijuana.”
Evans can't predict the federal response to weed either, but they have a hope: “Given the [Trump] administration's other concerns, I'm thinking marijuana won't be a big concern of theirs.”

Elendil was slain by a single blow from Sauron's mace and Isildur lay prone before their enemy, but as the Dark Lord loomed over the fallen prince, Isildur snatched the hilt of their father's broken sword and struck wildly. The prince's swipe cleaved the Ring from Sauron's hand and in so doing the Dark Lord's power was undone. Sauron's body was destroyed and the war won.
Yet even in defeat were the seeds of Sauron's ultimate victory laid, for the One Ring remained, and with it the spirit of the Dark Lord's was bound to Middle-earth. Staggering to their feet, Isildur beheld this strange treasure, gazing upon it in awe. Yet given the choice to destroy it and end the threat of Sauron for all time, the prince instead claimed the Ring as their prize. As their gloved fingers closed about it, the Ring in turn claimed Isildur and worked its dark influence upon him, corrupting their weak mortal soul as it would all those who bore it after him.
President Trump might risk "nuclear war" with North Korea in order "to build up their popularity," a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said they fear.
"What I fear is, they sort of got a political bump they got a political bump from the Syria air strike [and] the mother of all bombs strike in Afghanistan," Rep. David Ciciline, D-R.I., told MSNBC's Ali Velshi on Friday. "And we don't want the president to be making decisions where they just sort of thinks more bombs are the way to build up their popularity, but rather they're making decisions based on the national security interests of the United States and the long-term safety and security of the American people."
Ciciline, who as co-chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee is tasked with presenting "a sharp contrast to House Republicans' special interest-first agenda," evinced skepticism of Trump's recent foreign policy moves throughout the interview. They emphasized, for instance, that the Syria strike "didn't even do much damage" and avoided a direct endorsement of the attack. They suggested as well that the deployment of an aircraft carrier group to the region "as a show of force" is inadvisable, compared to diplomatic efforts to bring the regime to heel.
"A preemptive strike, if it were to happen, is likely to ignite a very serious conflict, a war, and maybe even a nuclear war," Ciciline said. "It would expose American troops on the [Korean] peninsula to tremendous danger ... The appropriate course is to really reduce the rhetoric and try to de-escalate this and continue to use all the levers of diplomatic-economic power to try to achieve the right results here."

CPD rules officer violated division policy in stomp of suspect Copyright by WCMH - All rights reserved Video
COLUMBUS (WCMH) -- After investigating, the Columbus Division of Police officials have ruled that Officer Zachary Rosen used a type of force outside of department's policy.
According to a release by CPD, Rosen's stomp on a suspect April 8, was an untrained technique and found to be an unreasonable force applied. The strike was considered a violation, and the investigation has been forwarded to the Division's Discipline Grievance Section for a just cause review.
A lieutenant assigned to the Professional Standards Bureau will review the investigation for completeness in accordance with Division policy and the collective bargaining agreement. A review of past discipline decisions involving similar conduct by Division employees will assist in determining whether the actions of the officer warrant deviation of progressive discipline, which could result in a hearing in front of the Chief of Police.
The Division's Use of Force policy states:
Officers shall use their training to guide them through a use of force The preferred response to resistance and aggression is a trained technique. However, during a situation involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, the use of an untrained response (e.g., neck restraints), while not normally authorized, may be reasonable to end the threat and survive the encounter. The proper exertion of physical force used to control persons shall be consistent with Division policy.
Rosen was one of two officers involved in the June, 2016 shooting death of Henry Green. A grand jury recently declined to indict Rosen and Officer Jason Bare for that shooting.
The incident started Saturday along the 3100 block of Maize Road. Columbus police officers were investigating a report of a man threatening to "shoot up the house and everyone in it," according to a police report.
According to court documents, police chased the suspect south from the home on Maize Road. Officers caught up with them in the 800 block of Weldon Avenue.
Video posted to YouTube by Roiesha Pettiford shows a portion of the arrest. The suspect, Demarko Anderson, appears to be on the ground with an officer on top of him. Another officer, later identified as Rosen, comes from outside of the frame and kicks Anderson.
Local Fraternal Order of Police president Jason Pappas said they were "disappointed in the way the press release was done."
"You can't put on TV what I feel," they said. "I've been here for 25 years and we have use of force every day and we don't put out a press release for those.
"To put this out before the investigation is complete could prejudice the investigation, and I don't think that was appropriate."
Saudis' Deliberate Negligence the Primary Cause of Increasing Death Toll in Mina Catastrophe
Eyewitness reports from Mina suggest that the catastrophe wasn't an incident but a controlled crime.

(SALEM, Ore.) - Eyewitness reports indicate that there was deliberate and serious negligence of Saudi aid workers after the stampede to deliver medical services and that caused the mounting number of victims to grow to nearly 5000 people.
The eyewitnesses believe although the stampede happened at 8 in the morning, and aid workers were present at the site, they deliberately delayed treating many of the victims until noon. The delay certainly played a pivotal role in the growing death toll.
Saudi officials have always asserted their vigilance in serving the Hajis but the eyewitness reports from Mina suggest that the catastrophe wasn't an incident but a controlled crime. #NO2ALSAUD

The reach of the Apple Watch is due to expand both domestically and internationally in the coming weeks, reportedly arriving in Belgium on Sept. 19, and possibly U.S. carriers Sprint and T-Mobile later in the month.
The Belgian launch is official and will coincide with the opening of the country's first Apple Store , local site Apple Weetjes said on Thursday. Sport models will start at 419 ($475) and 469 ($531) in 38- and 42-millimeter sizes, respectively, while stainless steel Watches will begin at 669 ($758) and 719 ($814).T-Mobile USA will begin selling the Watch on Sept. 25, the same day as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, according to MacRumors. The carrier's CEO, John Legere, recently confirmed plans for Watch sales, but did not offer a definite date.Sprint will also begin sales on the 25th, according to stock screens from the carrier. Prices should be roughly identical to Apple's, though allegedly 99 cents higher. Unusually the carrier is expected to sell only third-party accessories by companies like Mophie and CaseMate, leaving out Apple bands.Apple has been trying to deepen the retail footprint of the Watch since it first launched the product in April. It also recently debuted new band and finish options , and should release watchOS 2 once bugs are fixed
Share. The Iron Man 3 actor gives us a little more info. The Iron Man 3 actor gives us a little more info.
Actor Ben Kingsley, who played The Mandarin in Iron Man 3, recently talked about a “Secret Marvel Project” they were working on that involved many of the Iron Man 3 crew. Last week, we got wind of another rumour that suggested their project will be a Marvel One Shot. Now, Kingsley's revealed a little more on their mysterious project, but first...
IRON MAN 3 SPOILERS AHEAD
If you're still reading, you'll know that Kingsley played an actor, Trevor Slattery, in Iron Man 3 rather than The Mandarin himself. Last week's rumour suggested the secret project is a One Shot in which “The REAL Mandarin is furious with Aldrich Killian and Ben Kingsley's character Trevor Slattery for the mockery they made of the real Mandarin's identity and legacy. The real Mandarin wants to set the record straight.”
In a new interview with the actor in Vanity Fair, it seems that that that there may be some truth to this rumour. Although Kingsley doesn't confirm the "real Mandarin" part, they do seem to be encouraging the One Shot idea.
"I think it may be seen as . . . sometimes [Marvel] tacks on a short film to one of their other releases, maybe on a DVD or something," said Kingsley to the magazine. "I haven't heard anything at all about this. So it's in progress. It will have to remain under wraps. Marvel was so brilliant in the way they kept the transition from the Mandarin to Trevor Slattery in Iron Man 3. They were absolutely brilliant at it. I so respect the way they dearly want to surprise their audiences. But we will just have to leave it in the realm of rumor."
We'll update you with more on this interesting little project once we hear it.

Politicians from both sides of the aisle agree that reducing waste, fraud, and abuse of federal spending is an important and cost-saving goal. Each successive administration pledges to improve the government's flight attendantship of taxpayer dollars, yet waste is never fully eradicated.
This week's chart, which uses 2012 data from the Office of Management and Budget's “High-Error Programs Report” to display improper payment amounts and improper payment rates of federal transfer programs, shows that over $100 billion in taxpayer funds were improperly spent in 2012.
The chart ranks transfer programs that allocate at least $750 million in payments from those with the lowest improper payments in dollars to those with the highest improper payment amounts. The chart also displays the total improper payment rates as a percentage of total program outlays for each program.
Some programs, like the Social Security Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI) programs, have improper payment amounts that are relatively high when compared to their improper payment rate. While $3.2 billion was improperly spent on Social Security benefit payments in 2012, the large overall amount of benefit payments made by the agency ($785.8 billion in 2012) means that the improper payment rate is only 0.4 percent.
Other programs, like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), not only have a high improper payment amount but also a relatively high improper payment rate. The $12.6 billion in misspent EITC outlays represents a substantial portion, 22.7 percent, of total EITC spending—suggesting that the EITC is prone to fraud, waste, and abuse. As the chart displays, Medicare Advantage (Part C), Unemployment Insurance (UI), and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) face problems similar to the EITC, with anywhere approximately from one in nine to one in eleven dollars in these programs being disbursed improperly.
The three largest programs in terms of improper spending amounts are all health-care related. Medicare Fee-for-Service, Medicare Advantage (Part C), and Medicaid top the chart with a combined $61.9 billion in improper payments. As economist Timothy Taylor points out, these high improper funding amounts are of particular concern in light of the federal government's expanded intervention in health-care markets, as improper payments may likely plague new federal health programs as well.
While people of good conscience on both sides of the political aisle can debate the merits of whether or not government should be involved in certain activities, none should tolerate the high levels of improper payments currently associated with government spending on social welfare programs. Federal spending has grown too massive to be adequately overseen. Waste, fraud, and abuse squanders public resources and undermines trust in government.
Faced with little prospect of ever being able to sell their flailing wireless business, Mobilicity's original investors are suing the Canadian government for $1.2-billion, alleging it broke promises made to entice them to invest in the first place.
Mobilicity's story goes back to the fall of 2006, when a government official approached Canadian business person John Bitove about investing in a new wireless venture, according to the lawsuit.
Ottawa had just conducted a review of the competitiveness of the industry, which was dominated by three large national players, and was preparing for an auction of radio spectrum, the airwaves used to offer cellular services.

Mr. Bitove was already well known for their development of satellite radio provider Sirius XM Canada.
The lawsuit alleges Industry Canada encouraged them to put together a business plan and seek financial backers based on assurances that the government would establish conditions to support the growth of new entrants to the wireless market, including rules mandating roaming on the incumbents' networks and sharing their cell towers.
Mr. Bitove and New York-based private equity firm Quadrangle Group LLC eventually did invest, purchasing spectrum licences worth $243-million in the 2008 auction, building a network and launching a retail wireless business in large urban centres in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta. But the company has struggled since then and has been under creditor protection for almost a year.
Lower cellphone prices and increased competition have become a critical plank in the government's pro-consumer platform, but some say what is viewed as its inconsistency on policy has left potential investors wary.
The lawsuit claims that despite making promises that the investors would be able to sell their spectrum licences to one of the incumbents after a five-year period, the government has since blocked three attempts by Mobilicity to sell its airwaves to Telus Corp.
"Having caused the plaintiffs to lose substantially all of their investment, Industry Canada broke its final promise by refusing to allow the sale of the business after five years," reads the statement of claim, which was filed Thursday by both Quadrangle and Mr. Bitove's company Data & Audio-Visual Enterprises Investments Inc. (DAVE), which owns and operates Mobilicity.
DAVE invested $44-million while Quadrangle invested $217-million in equity and provided a further $95-million in debt financing. They are seeking damages for, among other things, negligence, breach of contract and loss of goodwill for a total of $1.204-billion.

Bob Richardson, a spokesperson for the private equity firm, said Quadrangle did not rush into the decision to commence litigation against Industry Canada. "They took this action because they felt that all other opportunities to deal with the government had been exhausted," they said. A representative for Mobilicity declined to comment.
Jake Enwright, press secretary for Industry Minister James Moore, said they would not comment on specific issues raised in the statement of claim because the matter is before the courts. "Our government is committed to protecting Canadian consumers and we will continue to support policies that lead to more choice and greater competition in the wireless sector," they said Friday.
The lawsuit alleges that Industry Canada did not live up to its promises but rather, "always intended to make decisions based on what it considered to be expedient at the time."
Telus has also launched legal action, filing a claim last year for judicial review of Ottawa's spectrum transfer policy, which the company argues indefinitely extended what was supposed to be a five-year ban on transfers to incumbents. (It already lost one court battle over the rules for this year's spectrum auction.)
At an industry conference in July, Rogers Communications Inc.'s vice-president of regulatory affairs, Ken Engelhart, said when the rules for the 2008 auction were announced, an Industry Canada official similarly assured them in person that if the new entrants were insolvent five years down the road, large carriers such as Rogers would be able to buy them.
Canaccord Genuity analyst Dvai Ghose said in a research note the lawsuit appears to be another barrier to persuading new investors to take a chance on Canada's wireless market.
Story continues below advertisement
VimpelCom Ltd., which owns fellow new entrant Wind Mobile, has been unable to find a buyer for its Canadian asset.
"In particular, we wonder why any financial or strategic investor would be interested in being a wireless new entrant without any obvious exit strategy," Mr. Ghose wrote.
The statement of claim alleges that Industry Canada entered into a contractual agreement with DAVE and Quadrangle when the department offered to establish and enforce rules to support a new entrant in Canada's wireless market. It says the investors accepted that offer by purchasing the spectrum licences.
Quadrangle said in a statement Friday that Industry Canada "breached its assurances that it would enforce foreign-ownership rules, require incumbent carriers to provide roaming and access to cell towers at reasonable rates and terms, prevent unfair and anti-competitive practices and allow spectrum to be transferred."
It added that "the prospect of any meaningful foreign investment in Canadian wireless industry for the foreseeable future has been lost."
Industry Canada must file a statement of defence or notice of intent to defend within 20 days of receiving the claim.

The Weather of My Youth
by Michael Stutz
My Kurt Cobain moment happened only months before they died — Halloween night in the last October of their life. They were playing Rhodes Arena, the big concert hall at the University of Akron. We didn't know it then, but Nirvana was on its final tour. They came out on stage in costume: Kurt was dressed like Barney, the big purple dinosaur for kids. Dave Grohl was a mummy behind the drums. Krist Novoselic painted up their face like some kind of weird mime and Pat Smear, the new guitarist, pretended to be Slash.
The weather was crazy then. The summer had been long, and that night a massive storm dumped a heavy load of snow upon the world, as if the autumn hadn't even mattered. Even before the show it was already in the air — you couldn't see it yet, but there was a steep change in pressure you could feel. It was almost too warm, the night too clear; far winds were coming and the years were dripping out their days too quick.
There was a mosh pit at the show, of course, but that was only for the kids and absolute outsiders — all the beleaguered veterans of mosh pits rolled their eyes and stayed away. These were changing times. We were all feeling older now, and our band Nirvana was a supergroup, no longer our own little secret that played on college radio. They weren't underground at all — they weren't even “alternative” anymore. At this point they were on top of everything. So technically, we had won. The revolution, or whatever it was that took our generation out in a single, broad tsumani wave in '91, had finally been conceded us — but even so, one could not deny a sense of bitterness and loss. I was guilty of this disillusionment myself. I went around saying how I refused to see or even follow them, they were way too big — I accused them, in a sneer, of completely selling out.
This attitude was typical of those in my position. As a rock journalist-in-the-making it was my somber duty to evaluate and call the shots. The rock scene was our life, and the bands spoke to us in the language of the prophets. We knew all the songs; the music was our sweetest prayer and poesy. We thought the bands would save us. But we were kids ourselves, and hadn't found our own way in the world — I hadn't yet made it through the great gray mazes of Manhattan, hadn't really gone anywhere on my own; even the whole West Coast was just a TV image to me then.
Volunteering for the college paper and then the local free arts weekly meant that I was ushered in wherever I wanted to go, for free, and appearing backstage after shows was as smooth and natural as stepping into my bedroom at my parents' house. If I liked a band, it wasn't long before I'd be hanging out with them. And so it's easy now to reimagine a goodbye that Halloween night, even though I realize what it comes to: just a passing moment in our lives when we stand together in a room.
Looking at it now, the whole thing plays over and over in my head, like a homemade YouTube clip. We're backstage, in a place of painted cinder block that seems to serve multiple functions — there are couches, metal coat racks wheeled up against a wall, and it's lit by rows of schoolhouse fluorescents so you can't sense the time of day. The rest of the band are over by the food tray along with someone from The Breeders and a few other media people who had passes. In the hall is the steady, scraping bustle of the road crew, older guys who are wheeling out the speakers and the boxed equipment.
This is the moment I am standing next to Kurt. That's when I say to him, “You are my brother.”
He's all sweaty and tired from the show, and he's quiet, doesn't even say hello, they just takes in what I tell him. I'm not sure they get it, that I looked up to them like they were an older brother; maybe they get it even more than I do. But they don't say a word. They just stares. Our eyes are locked. I'm a kid and he's a man and everything is moving quick — yet revisiting that YouTube clip again I'm surprised to see he's almost that much a kid as I am.
“What's your name, brother?”
“Mike.”
He's pensive, like they know there isn't time, and as if to recapitulate this fact some people start calling for them now — their tour handlers want them on the bus. Someone else is talking excitedly about the snow. Their hand is on my shoulder now.
“Goodbye, brother Mike.”
On YouTube, my own hand is resting on their shoulder at this moment, too.
“Goodbye, brother Kurt.”
And then that world is totally erased, covered up in white. It's more than an hour after the show and almost nobody is around; the mammoth noise of the concert is replaced by the quiet and the darkness of the night, mute fields of brand-new snow. You can see the fury of the storm at points in the coppery glow of the high-pressure sodium street lamps. To drive in it is like voluntarily diving headlong into a surrealistic dream: besides the salt trucks spitting coarsely on the road in front of you, there's nothing — just the blinding, silent fury of the snow.
In the safe darkness of my bedroom, I think of Kurt my lost brother, sleeping on the tour bus as it's cutting through the wall of spilling flakes in a far and unknown country, never to return — as if all of us really were strangers in this weird world, unable to connect outside these tiny haunted dreams.
A few months later, on that Friday afternoon in April, I got the call that they had died. It was a chunk of ice pressed suddenly to my back. I couldn't say anything in reply — my lips, my tongue, my jaw, my whole body had gone immobile. All I could do was stand there holding the phone. For five minutes I was a statue, as frozen and as sudden as that October snow. It's twenty years and I still can feel the way that it began to melt.

Washington (CNN) For a second time, a president is sending Jon Huntsman overseas on an assignment that could block their political ambitions.
President Donald Trump's decision to tap the Republican former Utah governor as the US ambassador to Russia puts Huntsman on the sidelines the day before veteran Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch announced their plans Thursday to run for another term in 2018. The two moves came amid speculation that Huntsman would challenge Hatch in the Republican primary.
Unlike several other former Trump critics who have lost out on political appointments, Huntsman's harsh words during the home stretch of the campaign didn't doom him. Several senior administration officials told CNN Wednesday that Huntsman had accepted the diplomatic posting.
On Tuesday, Huntsman had dodged a question from a Washington Post reporter -- asked in front of Hatch -- about whether they would challenge Hatch in Utah.
Huntsman here at Senate with Hatch. I asked Huntsman in front of Hatch if he'd rule out a run against Hatch. They wouldn't. Slightly awkward.
But Hatch told CNN that they spent an hour with Huntsman on Wednesday and believed their "long-time friend" posed no threat. "I don't think they would have ever run against me," Hatch said. "He didn't really want to run for Senate."
Huntsman did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Huntsman got the nod despite their criticism of Trump during the presidential race -- particularly their assertion that Trump should step aside and vice presidential nominee Mike Pence should head the ticket after the 2005 "Access Hollywood" tape surfaced.
Many other Trump critics -- including long-time Huntsman rival Mitt Romney, another Mormon with Utah ties who was in the running for secretary of state -- have not landed posts in Trump's administration.
It's the second time in the last eight years that a president has named Huntsman an ambassador amid speculation about the 56-year-old's political aspirations.
In 2008, Obama's move came as Democrats feared Huntsman would be a viable 2012 presidential challenger.
It didn't prevent Huntsman from running. They resigned as the ambassador to China in time to return to the United States and launch a bid for the GOP nomination.
But their tenure in Obama's administration -- including their praise for Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- did doom Huntsman in the Republican primary. Their candidacy never got off the ground and they dropped out of the race after finishing third in the New Hampshire primary.
One of the fellow Republicans who held their feet to the fire was Trump. The billionaire business person repeatedly jabbed Huntsman during that 2012 campaign, mocking their tenure as ambassador to China.
Jon Huntsman called to see me. I said no, they gave away our country to China! @JonHuntsman — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2012
"Jon Huntsman called to see me. I said no, they gave away our country to China!" Trump tweeted in February 2012, three weeks after Huntsman had dropped out of the GOP presidential race.
In September 2011, Trump bragged on Twitter that they hadn't returned Huntsman's call.
@JonHuntsman called to set up a meeting. Haven't returned their call. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2011
In December, they called Huntsman a "lightweight."
The lightweight, @JonHuntsman, used my name in a debate for gravitas--it didn't work. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2011
Later that month, they called Huntsman a "weak" diplomat.
Our diplomats are weak: @JonHuntsman's China policy proves why we need businesmen to negotiate against China. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2011
Huntsman, unlike some other perceived GOP moderates, had held their tongue on Trump through most of the campaign -- but unloaded after the "Access Hollywood" tape, in which Trump made lewd and sexually aggressive remarks about women, became public.
"In a campaign cycle that has been nothing but a race to the bottom -- at such a critical moment for our nation -- and with so many who have tried to be respectful of a record primary vote, the time has come for Governor Pence to lead the ticket," Huntsman told The Salt Lake Tribune.
Trump has already rejected candidates for diplomatic posts over their criticism of him.
Elliot Abrams, whom Secretary of State Rex Tillerson chose over Huntsman as their No. 2, was nixed by Trump after finding out about a negative article the former George W. Bush adviser had written of the GOP nominee.
The President and Abrams held a meeting in February that by all accounts went well. But when Trump later learned of the article, they could not get past Abrams' harsh critique, three Republican sources told CNN at the time
That treatment has led many Washington observers to see Huntsman's appointment as aimed at neutralizing their political threat -- one that Abrams didn't represent.
Administration officials, for their part, have been quick to praise Huntsman's diplomatic chops.
Huntsman, who speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and whose family lived and worked in Taiwan for a period in the 1980s, worked in a series of Asia-focused commerce and trade posts under President George H.W. Bush before being named ambassador to Singapore at age 32. They were a deputy US trade representative under President George W. Bush before being elected governor of Utah.
One senior administration official said Huntsman was tapped for the Russian ambassadorship because they are a "brilliant guy," "tough" and understands what the President wants.
Huntsman is a "remarkably good choice" at a time when American attitudes toward the Kremlin are becoming increasingly polarized, according to former US ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering.
"Jon Huntsman is an individual who can bring a great sense of reality -- they understand international politics as well as anybody I know and I think he's a remarkably good choice for this job," Pickering added.
The Russian government reacted to the choice with more circumspection.
Asked Thursday about the likely appointment of Huntsman, Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, "We would welcome any head of the US Embassy in Moscow who will be strongly committed to idea of a dialogue with Moscow."
Death lineups were all #NBATwitter could talk about at times last season. But Randy Wittman rarely employed “death” in lineup form during their tenure with the Wizards. And perhaps that was the death of him—inflexibility, that is, which is contrary to the hallmark of versatile death lineups.
The Golden State Warriors made famous a killer five-man unit of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Igoudala, Harrison Barnes (now Kevin Durant), and Draymond Green. All good passers, with positions 3-thru-5 capable of playing inside and out, and two out-of-this-world shooters—and of course this concept would not succeed without a unique player like Green.
Jonathan Tjarks of The Ringer recently wrote about Golden State's general matchup superiority, plus five up-and-coming teams that “have what it takes to find success out of the Warriors model.” Those teams: the Pistons, Magic, Jazz, Celtics, and Timberwolves ( ).
How we got here is fairly elementary. Effective lineups in today's game demand an increased premium on 3-point shooting atop the long-entrenched presence of athletic big men who can spread the floor but do all the other dirty defensive work required (Rasheed Wallace is long gone and Kevin Garnett is almost there). This Golden State scheme is just another chapter in the book. Yesterday's stretch-4 is today's stretch-5.
You have to go far down the list of top Wizards lineups from 2015-16 to find one that did not include at least one of the following “bigs”: Marcin Gortat, Nene, Kris Humphries, DeJuan Blair, Ryan Hollins, Drew Gooden, or J.J. Hickson—yes, all these guys played for the Wizards last season. None of these big men, mind you, can shoot the 3-pointer well enough to force any opposing coach to change defensive tactics, nor were they even capable of guarding ball screens by switching.
So here's the extent of Wittman's creativity, if you will ( ):
John Wall, Ramon Sessions, Gary Neal, Otto Porter, and Jared Dudley saw 16 total minutes of action together over four games—Wittman's 46th-most-used lineup. They were minus-1 in plus/minus.
Wall, Bradley Beal, Neal, Porter, and Dudley saw 13 minutes together to the tune of plus-16.
Wall, Beal, Garrett Temple, Porter, and Dudley were minus-3 over 12 minutes.
Wall, Sessions, Beal, Neal, and Dudley: 10 minutes on the season and an even-0 in plus/minus.
We could dive deeper into small-sized sample theaters, but let's not. Also: Jared Dudley is no Draymond Green, but they always meant well. And, to be fair to Wittman, last season's roster construction didn't really allow (or convince) the coach to get wild hairs and play nearly super-small lineups. Or, the context offered by Tjarks: “The trick to small ball is playing guys who aren't all that small.”
The current thinking in Wizards Land: Otto Porter has a 7'1.5″ wingspan and Kelly Oubre has a 7'2″ wingspan ( ). The Wizards will need 2013's third overall draft pick, Porter, more than ever. Oubre, a sophomore-to-be, isn't completely ready, but the Wizards may not be able to afford to bring them on slowly any longer. He's got potential on defense, anyway.
Furthermore: Washington acquired Markieff Morris on February 18 and they really became the only near-death lineup option at the 5 spot.
Morris is strong, he's nimble on their feet, and the Wizards at least encouraged them to shoot 3s in an offense driven by John Wall. The caveats: Morris' wingspan isn't otherworldly (like Green's—6'10.75″ for Morris, 7'1.25″ for Draymond), and there are times when Morris' defensive attentiveness and willingness don't align. What can a new environment, or occasionally used scheme, do to ignite their career?
Morris only saw around 10 minutes at the 5 for Wittman's Wizards, per rough calculations, and that was divided between 11 different five-man units. Seven of those lineups included Wall, and three of those lineups included both Wall and Beal.
Just one lineup with Morris at 5 included both Otto Porter and Kelly Oubre as the 3-4 combo. The guards were Ramon Sessions and Marcus Thornton over that single minute of action.
Where we've arrived is Washington's most capable lineup of death being Wall, Beal, Porter, Oubre, and Morris, obviously. Wonder what Scott Brooks thinks.
During their last season coaching in Oklahoma City, Brooks' top 13 most-used lineups each included big man pairings between Steven Adams, Serge Ibaka, Enes Kanter, Nick Collison, Kendrick Perkins, and Mitch McGary. A squad of Reggie Jackson, Dion Waiters, Anthony Morrow, Kevin Durant, and Perkins played 43 minutes together (over 8 games) to the tune of plus-6. The next small-ball lineup featuring players you'd actually want on the court played 23 minutes of action (same crew as above except with Jeremy Lamb instead of Waiters).
The general summer analysis is true: after failing to even secure a meeting with Durant and losing out to the Celtics for Plan B, Al Horford, Washington's big splash this offseason was an overdue move: getting a new coach ( ).
The theme that's developed with the hire:
Brooks will better facilitate (young) player development, and The new coach is likely much more amenable to lineup experimentation.
They won't be coaching for their job like Wittman. That could pair nicely with whispers so far that Brooks is more “militaristic,” than their predecessor, which probably just means regimented. Plus the roster is also set up to better facilitate such.
One could envision floor-spreaders Andrew Nicholson or Jason Smith playing the 5 in a death unit (individual evaluations of pick-and-roll defense notwithstanding—I mean, that Jason Smith signing, don't you want to just die?). In their Ringer article, Tjarks even takes some liberties in touting that Orlando could field a “death” lineup with Serge Ibaka at the 4 and Bismack Biyombo at the 5. This doesn't actually differ much from the Wizards playing Marcin Gortat or Ian Mahinmi at the 5 next to an Oubre-Porter 3-4, or even Morris at 4.
The key to all this is, as Tjarks said, not playing so small. In other words, having “bigs” who can guard down and won't create a severe defensive mismatch on a switch. Washington has the personnel in place with a very capable defensive lineup of Wall, Beal, Porter, Oubre, and Morris.
The butter is when each player is capable of being a 3-point threat. Last season's percentages from deep: Beal (38.7%), Porter (36.7%), Wall (35.1%), Oubre (31.6%), and Morris (31.6%)—a ton of room for improvement, especially when it comes to the best shooter, Beal, who should be cracking the 40 percent mark.
Upward and onward go the Wizards, and until there is evidence, this is nothing but fodder—or embalming fluid, depending on your outlook. At least the infrastructure provides more promise than it does the proverbial nail in the coffin.

Oh the New Zealand summer...the plan for today was to catch a helicopter onto Franz Josef Glacier and go for a hike. Not only is that the coolest way to reach a glacier, it is also the only way as the lower regions of this glacier are too unstable to safely walk on. Well but the great summer weather didn't play along. It's raining and many low-hanging clouds make it impossible for the helis to fly. Ok they said they could fly us up there but wouldn't be able to pick us back up till at least Wednesday. So the only thing left to do was taking a hike along the valley trying to get a view of the glacier. Well you could see some parts of it but it was mostly covered by clouds, especially the higher regions. It's a real pity, I was hoping for such cool pictures from up there. Well but that's nature, you just can't control it and I would just need a lot more time to wait for a great picture. Unfortunately I only have a month and I have to move on to the south. Let's hope the weather changes.
Veteran and PTSD service dog kicked out by defiant restaurant owner [WFXT-TV]
A 21-year Air Force and Iraq War veteran has gone public with their complaint against a Massachusetts restaurant owner after both they and their service dog were barred from the eatery because of the owner's allegations the dog is not legitimate.
WFXT-TV reported on Sunday that James Glaser and their dog, Jack, were kicked out of Big I's eatery in Oxford despite showing documentation proving the dog helps treat Glaser's post-traumatic stress disorder.
“Many times, he's [woken] me up from night terrors,” Glaser told WFXT. “And then, during the day, when I get upset and mad or something scares me or whatever, they come up and paws my chest.”
But Big I's owner, Russell Ireland, refused to accept Glaser's certificate during their encounter on Saturday, even after local police verified its authenticity.
“This is a post-traumatic stress dog,” Ireland told WHDH-TV and other local media on Sunday. “It's to give them emotional support. How much emotional support do you need when you are eating breakfast.”
Faced with a barrage of angry phone calls and threats after the incident became public knowledge, WHDH reported that Ireland has apologized to veterans with what they consider a “legitimate service dog,” while still refusing to serve Glaser, who has, in turn, threatened to file an Americans with Disabilities Act complaint.

Update, 7:21 a.m. EST Aug. 28: WCVB-TV reported on Tuesday that Ireland has apologized to Glaser for refusing to serve him.
“I didn't realize how important it was,” Ireland told a local radio station. “I'm changing my mind and my stance on what I said earlier. I believe now that they are very necessary. And I again apologize for my mistake.”
According to WCVB, a protest at the diner has been scheduled for Saturday.

FILMS FOR KIDS 2013-2014 EXPECTATIONS
- Impact, inspire and work with over 100 kids in Boys & Girls Clubs in Placentia, Brea, Yorba Linda, Santa Ana, Fullerton, and Laguna Beach, CA beginning in July 2013.
- Help the kids create 8 unique and original short films
- These films will be showcased in a FILM FESTIVAL in April 2014 that will celebrate the kids' accomplishments.
- Develop a sustainable business model that can be implemented in following years and in other counties.
FILMS FOR KID OVERALL MISSION
Partnering with local Boys & Girls Clubs, Films for Kids' mission is to bring the art of film making to the youth of America, to help develop responsible adults, by promoting creativity, dedication, teamwork and leadership in a fun and respectful environment. Under the guidance of professionals, participants will be able to write, act and design costumes and sets to create original and fun short films which will then be screened in a film festival. The project aspires to help build strong and productive communities through the development of valuable relationships between youth and talented, positive role models.
WHO ARE WE?
In 2006, Fat Addict Productions , LLC partnered with the Boys & Girls Club (BGC) of Yorba Linda to produce a short film for their drama club. Directed by Adam Angeles and Phuong Le, produced by the BGC's staff member Julie Vong, “Rumplestilitskin: Private Eye” was a rendition of the classic fairy tale, that featured Rumplestiltskin as a detective, out to uncover what was happening to the king's gold. The boys and girls of the drama club participated in costume and set design, acting and directing, adding their own flair to the final product.
A screening of the film was held at Mabel Paine Elementary School in Yorba Linda, CA, and was an absolute success as the kids' eyes lit up when they saw their work on the big screen. The film was well received by the audience, and the parents were proud of the work their kids had done. The event was even covered by the Orange County Register, which actually earned the attention of others in the community, who would later enroll their kids at the Yorba Linda branch to participate in the program.
Even more than the accolades and the press, the most rewarding aspect of the project was the experience of making the film itself. The kids were able to be creative, and come up with ideas to make the film better. The project empowered, and inspired the kids, encouraged them to work as a team, and most importantly was very enjoyable and fun.
This first experience, led to two more films that were equally successful, and also allowed more kids to get involved. Those that were in the program the year before became more involved in the film making process, as those that were new took on the acting roles. Each year, the kids would be inspired to be creative, work together as a team, and be disciplined enough to accomplish a fun and rewarding goal. The three films were extremely positive and unforgettable experiences that benefited Fat Addict, the BGC, and most importantly, the kids.
The Films for Kids Project wants to deliver this experience to the rest of the Boys & Girls Clubs in Orange County. Films for Kids will continue to inspire and empower youth through the county by providing a fun and creative outlet, while promoting teamwork, discipline and leadership.
Mauril Belanger's attempt to change the lyrics to Canada's national anthem have hit another snag in the House of Commons, as the Ottawa MP's health continues to deteriorate.
The Liberal government attempted to move a motion Thursday that would have permitted to bill to be shepherded by Chief Government whip Andrew Leslie, covering all the bases in case Belanger isn't able to be physically present in the House to initiate the final steps.
The motion required unanimous consent from MPs on all sides, which it did not receive.
There were cries of “shame” from the Liberal side of the House, directed at the Conservative benches.
Green Party leader Elizabeth May also took to Twitter to express their displeasure at what had happened. They later explained that they had clearly heard Conservatives saying “no” to the motion but wasn't sure exactly which MPs did so.
What a shame! CPC blocks consent to allow Mauril Belanger's PMB on inclusive O Canada to proceed, even if they are too sick to be here.#cdnpoli — Elizabeth May (@ElizabethMay) June 9, 2016
Liberals weren't much happier.
.@Mauril_Belanger's bill deserves to move forward. Denying consent because they aren't in the chamber just so the bill dies is just sad. — Sonia Sidhu MP (@SoniaLiberal) June 9, 2016
Belanger's bill, if it doesn't die in their absence, would change the lyrics to O Canada to be more gender neutral. Specifically, the line “in all thy sons command” would be changed to “in all of us command.”
Belanger recently served as honorary Speaker of the House of Commons for a single day and is dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — an incurable neurodegenerative disease, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease.

Their caucus colleagues are trying to get Belanger into the chamber on Friday so they can, as required, move the motion for the adoption of their bill at report stage if no amendments are sought. Liberal MPs have told reporters that it might be the last time the ailing MP will be able to come in to work.
It's not the first time the Conservatives have apparently attempted to use procedure to halt the bill's progress. In early May, they put up enough speakers to fill the first hour of allotted debate on the bill, rather than let the debate run out and thereby force a second reading vote the following week.
WATCH: House of Commons offers touching tribute to Mauril Belanger
Liberal MP Greg Fergus then sought unanimous consent to continue the debate for another hour — which would have had the same effect of forcing a vote — but Conservative MPs refused to give it.
At the time, Tory MP Andrew Scheer denied the Conservatives tried to hold up the bill, saying they treated it the same way as they would any other private member's bill. On Thursday, they repeated those lines.
“We all love and support Mauril and we understand he's going through a difficult time,” said Scheer “But it's not about Mauril, it's about the bill itself.”
Scheer explained that the vast majority of the Conservative caucus is opposed to the bill.
“They've heard from their constituents. I think the vast majority of Canadians feel they haven't even been consulted or even informed that this change to their national anthem is even happening.”
Scheer said the government was informed “long ago” that the Conservatives would not facilitate the bill's passage.

2) Ran the com.motioncoding.beats-2.apk which caused the phone to install 'something'.
3) Went into settings, changed the Music Effect to "Beats"
Immediately received an error about MusicFX not responding.
4) Tried several music apps and while music was playing went into the new AwesomeBeats app in the app drawer and modified a few settings to extremes to try to see if anything worked.. no sound change..
5) Thought maybe a reboot was in order (not mentioned in OP but hey never know). After reboot, verified beats was still selected in settings, it was.
6) Retried music and beats setting app.. no change.
7) Noticed another app in the App Drawer called "Install BeatsAudio" or something similar... CLicked that, and it said it was installing some files and then it rebooted the phone.. (I thought Aha! OP forgot to mention this)
8) After reboot, verified Beats was still selected in settings... tried Music and AwesomeBeats app again... still no changes no matter what settings were tried.
Since then I've removed the AwesomeBeats.apk from the system folder and rebooted.. menu is now gone in settings and things seem 'back to normal' (though nothing really changed that I could tell).
So there you have it... everything I've tried.
BTW this is on a STOCK Rooted S3 from Sprint... no custom ROM nor Kernel... perhaps that's a difference that is required and not mentioned?
Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that NATO will increase spending to move toward the organization's requirement that member nations pay 2 percent of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to support security and military operations.
The increase, according to Reuters, is “partly aimed at showing the United States they are committed to shouldering more costs.”
During their trip abroad in spring, President Donald Trump pushed members of the NATO alliance to start paying their fair share of the cost to keep the alliance solvent and effective.
“NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations,” Trump said, pointing out that 22 of 28 members were still not paying enough money for their national defense.
“This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,” Trump said.
“This year's 4.3 percent increase represents the fastest growth since more than a decade of cuts ended in 2014, Reuters reported. “Spending growth was 1.8 percent in 2015 and 3.3 percent last year, although it was unclear how near that takes members to the target.”
Stoltenberg said the increase in spending is NATO showing the U.S. it has reliable allies in the fight against common enemies.
“We have really shifted gears, the trend is up and we intend to keep it up,” Stoltenberg said and Newsweek reported. “It's more about high-end forces, heavier forces and more ready forces, meaning we need forces that are fully equipped, fully manned and fully trained.”
A report on NATO spending released on Thursday shows that only 6 of the 28 NATO countries are spending 2 percent or more of GDP. Aside from the United States, which pays about 3.6 percent of its GDP to support the alliance. Those nations are Greece, Estonia, the United Kingdom, Romania, and Poland.
“According to NATO's top diplomat, Romania, Latvia and Lithuania are expected to join the list by next year,” Newsweek reported. “Eastern allies have been among the most alarmed by Russia and its own military reinforcement.
“The three Baltics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as Poland, are also the biggest benefactors of NATO's updated posture on its eastern flank, deploying four multi-national battalions between them,” Newsweek reported. “Alongside Norway, they are NATO's sole allies bordering Russia.”
With last week's additions of Troy Tulowitzki and David Price, the Toronto Blue Jays made themselves into a legitimate postseason contender, adding two of the game's best players to a roster that was already pretty solid. Our rest-of-season forecast now has the Jays with the best projected winning percentage in the American League going forward, and while they'll likely have to win their win into the division series through the Wild Card game, the Jays look like they could be a dangerous team in October. Price, along with bullpen upgrades Latroy Hawkins and Mark Lowe, gives them a good bit more pitching depth than they had previously, and Tulowitzki adds another quality hitter to a line-up that was already overflowing with offensive weapons.
But the more I look at this roster, the more I begin to wonder whether we're overlooking one potentially significant flaw in this team's construction, especially when it comes to the postseason. A week ago, when writing about the Tulowitzki acquisition, I noted that adding a good hitter to a good line-up could actually provide non-linear positive returns, above and beyond just that single player's individual abilities, because getting guys on base leads to better outcomes for everyone else in the line-up. As I wrote then, we shouldn't be too concerned about diminishing returns from the Blue Jays already having “enough” offense.
One aspect of the Jays line-up I didn't talk about enough, however, was the fact that you can have diminishing returns based on line-up construction. Specifically, if you line up too many hitters from one side of the plate, your team will probably score fewer runs than would be expected based solely on overall batting lines, as a line-up that is dominated by same-handed hitters becomes a fairly easy match-up for the opposing manager in important situations. And while Troy Tulowitzki is an excellent player, the Blue Jays line-up may now lean too heavily to the right side.
Here is where the Jays non-pitchers stand relative to the rest of baseball in 2015 performance against RHPs and LHPs, to this point in the season.
This is a team that hits right-handers pretty well, getting a 107 wRC+ from their position players against RHPs, which ties them with the Astros for the seventh-best mark in baseball. But they absolutely crush left-handed pitching, running a 130 wRC+ against southpaws that is far and away the best mark of any team in the game; no one else is even really all that close. And this was before they added Tulowitzki, giving them another good hitter, but pushing their line-up even further to the right side of the spectrum.
In the regular season, where teams really can't do too much to manipulate their rotation to exploit match-ups, Blue Jays hitters have only had the platoon advantage in 45% of their at-bats, the second lowest total in the American League; the league average is 55%. And that number is almost certainly going to be lower in the postseason. Here are the 2011-2014 rates for how often a hitter has had the platoon advantage in the regular season and then in the postseason.
Season Regular Season Postseason Difference 2011 54% 49% -5% 2012 55% 54% -1% 2013 56% 51% -4% 2014 55% 51% -4%
With more frequent off-days and higher stakes on the outcome of each at-bat, managers are simply able to play the match-ups more frequently in October than they do in the regular season. Ask yourself this: if you were an opposing manager facing the Blue Jays in a postseason series, and you saw a line-up that ran out seven right-handed bats alongside Justin Smoak and Ben Revere, why would you ever throw a left-handed pitcher against them?
Among likely AL playoff opponents, the Houston Astros are really the only team that wouldn't be able to avoid playing into the Blue Jays strength, as their two best starting pitchers (Dallas Keuchel and Scott Kazmir) are both southpaws. Match-ups or not, the Astros aren't going to bench those two and go with inferior right-handed pitchers, though you can bet that they'd likely be willing to go to the bullpen a bit earlier in that series than they would against other teams.
But everyone else? They can essentially throw a never-ending string of right-handers at the Blue Jays in October.
The Royals feature one left-handed starter, Danny Duffy. They could easily be replaced for that series with Chris Young or Jeremy Guthrie, assuming they don't go pick up another serviceable #5 starter during the August waiver trade period. Their dominating bullpen is stocked with right-handed pitchers, and you can bet the Blue Jays would see a heavy dose of Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis, and Greg Holland in a series against KC.
The Angels feature two left-handed starters, but with only a four-man rotation needed in the postseason, there would be no real reason to give Andrew Heaney a start, meaning the Jays would only get one game against Hector Santiago. And like KC, their best relievers all run right-handed.
The Yankees rotation still has CC Sabathia in it right now, but the odds of them making a start against the Blue Jays in a postseason series are somewhere between slim and none. With Michael Pineda, Masahiro Tanaka, Nathan Eovaldi, and one of Ivan Nova, Adam Warren, or Luis Severino, the Yankees have more than enough right-handed starters to displace Sabathia. And while they aren't going to shy away from Andrew Miller in high leverage situations, RHBs are hitting .078/.195/.146 against them this year. Miller's 2015 dominance is even more impressive when you realize that 83% of the batters he's faced this year have been righties, and he's still been unhittable.
If the Jays do end up running down Minnesota for the Wild Card — and I think they will — they're almost certainly going to be going up against the Angels or Astros in the play-in game. If it's the Astros, you'd think it would be an advantage, because they match up well against Keuchel and Kazmir, but Houston is probably also one of the teams most likely to accept the fact that the Wild Card game should really just be a bullpen affair, making it a bullpen game instead. And so, realistically, they should probably be rooting for that game to come against Anaheim, leaving a potential Astros series for an ALDS or ALCS match-up where Keuchel and Kazmir would have to throw significant innings.
More realistically, though, the Blue Jays are just going to have to hit well against good right-handed pitching to advance in the postseason. They've created a line-up that strongly incentivizes opponents to stack up on sinker/slider RHPs, and they're likely going to get a steady dose of guys who are in baseball primarily because they dominate right-handed batters. Because teams can adjust their rosters every series, and can allocate their innings to exploit match-ups more heavily, the Blue Jays are probably going to have the platoon advantage in fewer than 40% of their postseason at-bats, and maybe even as low as 25-30%; we simply can't expect them to score runs in October the way they have been in the regular season, above and beyond the normal decline that comes from facing higher-quality opponents.
In fairness to Alex Anthopolous, there weren't a lot of great left-handed hitters getting moved at the deadline. Nearly all of the good hitters who changed teams — Tulo, Yoenis Cespedes, Carlos Gomez — were right-handed, so it's not like other teams were picking up the guys that the Jays should have been targeting instead. But I do wonder if the Jays overly right-handed line-up will become a problem for them in the postseason. Given the cost the team gave up to acquire David Price to push in on 2015, it might have made more sense to go for a better LH left fielder than Ben Revere, who isn't exactly going to punish anyone for leaving a right-handed specialist on the mound.
The Blue Jays have a good team, and their right-handed hitters are still good hitters, even against right-handed pitching. But they aren't as good as they are against left-handed pitching, and I wouldn't expect Toronto to see many southpaws in October. If they get bounced early, line-up balance may end up being a thing the 2016 Blue Jays look to correct.

The desperate dash to jump onto the open back of a Routemaster bus has become a thing of the past, after its famous hop-on, hop-off service came to an end.
The change follows the axing of 300 conductors as part of a £10 million cost-cutting programme by Transport for London — and it will mean the end of an era that began in 1956.
Unions voiced fury at the job losses and said conductors were being treated as “scapegoats”.
New-generation Routemasters, which entered service in 2012 under Boris Johnson, have folding doors that allow passengers to hop on and off — but only if there is a conductor, now branded a “customer assistant”, on board.
Without an assistant the doors are closed until activated by the driver at stops. Nineteen routes already run without assistants and yesterday they disappeared from the final six: numbers 9, 10, 11, 24, 38 and 390.
The Number 15 will remain hop-on, hop-off, but is a heritage route aimed at tourists.
Pete Kavanagh, London regional secretary for the Unite union, said: “London buses are a success story and the network looks ready to expand with an increasing population — there should be plenty of jobs available for conductors.
“There is no way that these conductors should be made the scapegoats because of the vanity project of Boris Johnson when they were mayor.”
The assistants are employed by bus operators Arriva, Go-Ahead, Metroline and RATP. TfL pledged to work with the firms to provide support and information on job opportunities for sacked conductors elsewhere.
Leon Daniels, TfL's managing director of Surface Transport, said: “The conductors have done a great job, but the New Routemaster routes that don't have conductors also operate very effectively and we can no longer justify the £10 million extra costs that could otherwise be invested in modernising the transport network.
"We are working with the bus companies to find conductors other opportunities within the transport industry.”
The new-generation Routemasters were a flagship policy of Mr Johnson. Costing about £350,000 per vehicle and designed with Thomas Heatherwick's Heatherwick Studios, the buses have hybrid engines and are fully accessible.
However, they suffered problems with air conditioning, and are being fitted with upstairs windows, at a cost of £2 million, after passengers complained of stifling heat.
More children than ever before in America are going to sleep at night without a home to call their own.
One out of every 45 children – some 1.6 million – in the United States is homeless, according to a report released Tuesday by the National Center on Family Homelessness. The majority of the children are under age 7.
The number of homeless children in 2010 exceeded even the total in 2006, when thousands of families displaced by hurricanes Katrina and Rita produced a historic spike in homelessness. Last year, at least 60,000 more children were homeless.
Homelessness among America's youths can have far-reaching consequences.
“If you believe that children are the future of our country, then you should be concerned because these homeless children have gradually become a prominent part of a third world that is emerging in our own backyards,” says Ellen Bassuk, president of the National Center on Family Homelessness in Needham, Mass.
The factors that can lead to child homelessness, such as extreme poverty and worst-case housing needs, have worsened with the economic recession – even though total housing capacity for families increased by more than 15,000 units in the past four years.
“The recession has been a human-made disaster for vulnerable children,” Ms. Bassuk says.
The National Center's findings were released in its “America's Youngest Outcasts 2010” report, which documents the number of homeless children in each state and their well-being. It also evaluates the risk for child homelessness and state-level planning and policy activities.
“Despite their growing numbers, homeless children are invisible to most of us; they have no voice and no constituency,” the report says. “Without a bed to call their own, these children have lost safety, privacy, and the comforts of home, as well as their friends, possessions, pets, reassuring routines and communities.”
Children experiencing homelessness also tend to struggle with hunger, poor health, and missed educational opportunities. A majority of homeless children have limited proficiency in math and reading, according to the report.
Compared with their housed counterparts, homeless children, in general, exhibit twice as many illnesses, such as respiratory infections, per month, according to a report by Ellen Hart-Shegos for the Family Housing Fund in Minneapolis.
Furthermore, Bassuk says, homelessness affects the emotional health of children.
“When you talk to adolescents and younger school-aged kids, they're universally incredibly embarrassed about being homeless,” they say. “It's a stigmatized situation for a kid who wants to be accepted by their peers, and when they're ashamed, they will do anything to make sure their friends don't find out.”
Since 2007, the homeless child population in 15 states increased by more than 50 percent. States with the highest percentages of homeless children were generally located in the South and Southwest, reflecting the higher levels of poverty in these states. States with the lowest percentages were generally located in the North and Northeast, where there is less poverty and stronger safety nets for children.
To combat homelessness, the most essential tool is further increasing the availability of decent, affordable housing, Bassuk says. Studies show that housing promotes health, improves educational outcomes, reduces stress, and provides a safe environment in which children can grow and thrive.
Bassuk also says that the Recovery Act's Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program must not be allowed to expire at the end of the year. Since 2009, this program has helped more than 1 million formerly homeless people into permanent housing.
But housing alone is not sufficient, says Bassuk.
"It must be aligned with critical services and supports if families are to remain stably housed in the community," the report says.
Bassuk warns against any further cuts to federal and state programs that provide such services and supports. These programs include job training, child-care services, and domestic-violence prevention.
Homeless children can end up making a positive contribution to society, points out Bassuk.
“These kids are no different than your kids or my kids. They have every potential to thrive and participate in building the nation's workforce,” they say. “But without adequate programs to curb homelessness, they're a victim of their own circumstances. And that's not right.”
Over a year of sometimes noisy night-time maintenance work will start this week to overhaul all four passenger lifts at Goodge Street underground station.
Overnight “enabling work” will start on Monday 10 July before the main project starts. This work will take place from 22:00 to 06:00 Sunday to Thursday.
Then from Monday 4 September 2017 until late-2018 the station will operate with a reduced lift service as two of the four lifts are serviced at a time.
“The work involves the removal and replacement of all the lift components,” says London Underground.
From September the station will remain open but will operate as exit only from 07:30 to 10:00 on weekday mornings. The lift overhaul work will take place overnight from 01:00 to 04:30 Sunday to Thursday when the station is closed.
London Underground says there will be periods of unavoidable noise during the work but that all staff will be briefed on the importance of keeping any avoidable noise to a minimum. If neighbours have any concerns they can telephone London Underground on 0343 222 2424 (24 hours).
Goodge Street Station was first opened in 1907 and in 2016 over eight million passengers entered and exited the station.

(Washington Jewish Week via JTA) — Maybe it's the centuries of living under Christian and Muslim rule. Maybe it's the history of forced conversion. Maybe it's that there's no religion requirement for the Jewish afterlife.
Whatever the reasons, Jews have traditionally been uncomfortable proselytizing.
But a Maryland foundation is flouting the taboo by funding outreach programs to non-Jews in an effort to bring them into the fold.
“Our primary purpose is to support programs that publicize Judaism to non-Jews,” Ellen Gerecht, executive director of the National Center to Encourage Judaism, says from their second-floor office in Silver Spring, Maryland. “We think Judaism has a lot to offer.
Asked if the ultimate goal is to convert non-Jews, Gerecht says, “Yes, because we think so much of Judaism. That would be the goal down the line.”
Founded in 1995, the National Center to Encourage Judaism has $2.3 million in assets and brings in about $375,000 annually, according to its 2013 tax information. That year, the foundation gave $50,000 to Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York and $28,000 to various synagogues throughout the United States.
Rabbi Michael Feshbach of Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Maryland, has worked with the foundation both at their synagogue and at former pulpits in Pennsylvania and New York. They have known Gerecht's father, Ash, who started the foundation, for years.

“I know that this foundation believes some of the greatest and most important spiritual ideas in the world are in our tradition, and we don't show it enough,” Feshbach says.
Feshbach has used funds from the National Center to Encourage Judaism to publicize a three-time weekly introduction-to-Judaism program called Taste of Judaism. They have led the program, which is held across the country, about a dozen times at their synagogues since 2010, with the next course scheduled for this fall.
Though they ran the ads in local mainstream newspapers, Feshbach says Taste of Judaism is primarily intended to reach out to people with Jewish ties. Along with some congregants, most attendees have a Jewish parent or partner and want to know more, they say.
But the rabbi says people of other religions have participated, too, including a small group from an African-American church.
“It's been the most amazing assortment [of participants] of anything I've done,” Feshbach says. “Speaking personally, I can say the more we learn about the people around us, the better we are. Sometimes, yes, this leads to continued interest. Of course we welcome that.”
They add: “We don't view it as we need to convert people to save their souls.”
Orthodox Judaism is generally opposed to proselytizing, though organizations like Aish HaTorah and Chabad conduct outreach to the non-Orthodox. Aish expresses a traditional Jewish view of the matter on its website.
“It would be discriminatory for Judaism to proselytize and try to convert those not of the religion,” an article on the site reads. “That would imply that everybody needs to be Jewish in order to make a relationship with God, participate in the Torah's vision of repairing the world, and get to heaven. Yet this is not so.”
READ: Convention of Reform Jews favors proselytizing of ‘unchurched'
Gerecht, of the National Center to Encourage Judaism, sees the issue in historical rather than theological terms. Jews haven't proselytized in the past, they say, because they weren't in a strong enough position to. But things have changed. If Jews don't spread their religion now, they say, Judaism simply “will not survive.”
Still, what their foundation promotes is more like welcoming than proselytizing, they insist.
“When you think about proselytization, you think going door to door. We are not advocating that,” they say. “We are going to try and get the word out.”
Most synagogues the National Center to Encourage Judaism works with are part of the Reform movement, which has made inclusion of intermarried families a priority. As far back as 1965, the movement adopted a resolution to proselytize and “missionize converts to Judaism among the unsynagogued and unchurched.”
Gerecht says there has also been growing interest in their foundation from the Conservative movement, which is struggling with dwindling numbers. Last year, Arnold Eisen, the chancellor of the movement's Jewish Theological Seminary, wrote a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed titled “Wanted: Converts to Judaism,” calling on Jewish leaders and rabbis to “actively encourage non-Jewish family members in our midst to take the next step and formally commit to Judaism.”
“It used to be novel to reach out to singles,” and now that's common, Gerecht says. “From an overall standpoint, we all want Judaism to grow.”
A 28-year-old woman has been charged after a laser was shone into the cockpit of an Edmonton police helicopter.
Police say the incident happened at around 3 a.m. Tuesday.
The Edmonton Police Service Air 1 helicopter was called to the scene of an attempted break and enter in the Bonnie Doon neighbourhood when a "blinding laser" was repeatedly shone into the helicopter's cockpit from the ground, EPS said in a news release.
Patrol officers were directed to a home near 88th Street and 84th Avenue, where a woman was arrested.
The woman was charged under the federal Aeronautics Act with endangering the safety of an aircraft in flight.
"The Edmonton Police Service has zero tolerance for irresponsible behavior like this that seriously compromises the safety of our air crew, not to mention our citizens," Staff Sgt. Tom Bechthold, of the EPS flight operations section.
If caught and convicted of shining a laser at an aircraft, a person can be fined up to $100,000, sentenced to up to five years in prison, or both.
Being the External Relations Manager for Indian Motorcycle has its perks. As the man who holds this position, Robert Pandya had the privilege of access to an Indian Chief that served as a development bike for Indian's engineering department. The motorcycle can't be sold and was headed to the crusher before Pandya got the brilliant idea to give it a touch of off-road capability and use it retrace the cross-country route of Erwin “cannonball” Baker.
Tomorrow, May 3, marks the 100th anniversary of Baker's record-breaking ride across the US on a twin-cylinder 1914 Indian Motorcycle. To celebrate the achievement, Don Emde and Joe Columbero have organized a cross-country ride that will follow Baker's route as closely as possible. The ride leaves from the original starting point of downtown, San Diego, tomorrow, with projected arrival in New York City on May 14. Joining Emde and Columbero on that ride will be Pandya on their “dual sport” Indian and 22 other adventurous souls.
Pandya's creation is affectionately called “Elnora.” At the heart of the machine is Indian's proprietary Thunder Stroke 111 engine, albeit teamed to a new two-into-one exhaust. While the frame appears to be stock as well, the bike now has crash guards front and back to go along with a new skid plate. Gone are the standard Chief Vintage whitewalls, a set of chunky
Crash guards, a bash plate, and heavier grooves in the tires give the Indian ‘dual sport' a bit more off-road capability.
It will be a glorious ride into the sunset as Pandya, Don Emde, and 23 others embark on a cross-country journey along the same route as Erwin ‘cannonball' Baker.
Dunlops in their place. Pandya and friends took a tire groover blade to them in hopes of gaining even more traction when the pavement ends. It also sports floorboards, a first we believe for a “dual sport” bike. But there will be long days in the saddle, so we understand their inclusion. Luckily, the new sprung solo seat looks pretty comfy. Here's what else Pandya had to say about the project.
“We stiffened up the suspension and added an early prototype air filter for performance. Most of the mods were eliminating things – the windscreen, saddlebags, driving light and fender skirts. As the bike had seen a rough testing life, the chrome was attacked with a Scotchbrite pad and some 80 grit sandpaper – it might as well be evenly scratched up! The click of rattle cans marked the paint job as a back alley special.
“Loads of help from friends inside engineering, some aftermarket folks including Saddlemen, Danner Boots, Dunlop as well as a custom bash plate and exhaust along with fender modifications care of Jeb Scolman at Jeb's Metal and Speed in Long Beach, CA. Lots of work was put in by our new press fleet manager Tom “TJ” Jackson and my friend Barry Hathaway, also.”
Pandya said he'll be “posting up trip photos and words via the Indian Motorcycle Social media feeds – so watch for those if you are interested.” More information about the ride and route can be found at Emde's “Finding cannonball's Trail” site, including the full cannonball Centennial Ride Summary. So if you see a pack of 25 riders on the road in your neck of the woods over the course of the next 11 days, give them a honk of encouragement as they embark on this memorable cross-country journey.

Web staff - TROY, N.Y. (NEWS10) – The New York attorney general will investigate the Rensselaer County district attorney and how they handled the fatal shooting of a black man by police.
It's part of a new executive order by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and gives AG Eric Schneiderman full authority to conduct an investigation into DA Joel Abelove's office.
Edson Thevenin was shot and killed in April 2016 after a police chase by Troy Officer Randy French. A grand jury cleared French of wrongdoing within days of the AG declaring they wanted to open their own investigation.
Thevenin's family said they didn't do anything wrong, and a witness came forward stating French shot Thevenin without being provoked.
Schneiderman's office sent the following statement to NEWS10 ABC:
As Attorney General Schneiderman said at the start of this investigation, their Special Investigations and Prosecutions Unit will follow the facts of this case wherever they lead. The Thevenin family—and the Rensselaer County community—deserve answers. The Governor's order provides our office with the authority we requested to investigate any parties that may have criminally interfered with our office's investigation into Mr. Thevenin's death. Our office will continue to pursue this case without fear or favor, and look forward to providing those impacted by Mr. Thevenin's death with more answers.
If you surf the internet, it's thanks to them
Father Roberto Busa was born on November 28, 1913, in Vicenza, Italy, and died in August 2011. They entered the seminary in 1928, the Society of Jesus (that is, the Jesuits) in 1933, and was ordained a priest on May 30, 1940. They studied philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and their thesis on “the Thomistic terminology of interiority” it was published in 1949.
Their thesis, however, was not their most important work on Aquinas: Father Busa is also the author of the “Index Thomisticus: Sancti Thomae Aquinatis operum omnium indices et concordatie,” a work in 56 volumes of almost a thousand pages each.
That's quite a resume on its own, but Father Busa, in a classic Jesuit fashion, went magis. That is, excelsior.
Father Busa (who, of course, was a professor of Thomist philosophy, and mastered Latin, Greek, German, French, English and Spanish in addition to their native Italian) is the father of hypertext.
Stefano Lorenzetto, a journalist from L'Osservatore Romano, summarizes Busa's work stating that “if you browse the internet, you owe it to him; if you go from one site to another by clicking the links marked in blue, you owe it to him. If you use your PC to write emails and text documents, you owe it to him.”
Once Busa finished their Index Thomisticus (a job that took them about 50 years, covering nine million words, as explained in this article published by the Venezuelan Jesuit SIC Magazine), they met with the founder of IBM, Thomas Watson, in order to produce a digital version of the Index in which a researcher could effectively search for related concepts in Aquinas' work. Watson told Busa that the computers they had back then could not relate the contents included in the Index in any way. But Busa, of course, insisted.
This conversation gave birth to the hypertext project: a structure for sharing and linking information between different sources, through links.
Next time you click on a link like this — or need to search the digital edition of the Index Thomisticus — give thanks for this Jesuit!
The nose, the forward underside and crew cabin of the space shuttle Endeavour approach first as the STS-134 vehicle prepares to dock with the International Space Station on May 18, 2011 (Flight Day 3). An Expedition 27 crew member took this photo at a distance of about 600 feet (180 meters).
HOUSTON — NASA engineers are taking a close look at several spots on the space shuttle Endeavour's belly where its vital heat shield tiles were during the spacecraft's launch earlier this week.,
Endeavour blasted off Monday (May 16) to begin a 16-day trip to the International Space Station. It is the shuttle's last mission before the orbiter is retired to a museum. [Photos of Shuttle Endeavour's Final Launch]
The damaged spots are on Endeavour's heat shield, which protects the spaceship from the fiery temperatures it experiences when re-entering Earth's atmosphere.
Most likely, the damage will turn out to be of no consequence, NASA officials said, but for now they must continue to analyze the patches to make sure.
"I am not concerned about the damage that we're seeing here," LeRoy Cain, chair of Endeavour's mission management team, told reporters Thursday (May 19). "It's certainly not alarming, and the team is not concerned about it."

NASA has kept a close eye on the health of space shuttle heat shields during mission since the tragic 2003 loss of the shuttle Columbia. A piece of fuel tank debris damaged Columba's heat shield during launch, leading to the shuttle's destruction during re-entry. Seven astronauts were killed.
Since then, shuttle astronauts have conducted several in-space inspections of their spacecraft to make sure the vehicle is safe for re-entry. Several repair tools and techniques are also available, should they be needed.
The damage on Endeavour is not on the same scale as that during the Columbia accident.
Photos of Endeavour's heat shield taken during a routine inspection by shuttle astronauts after launch, as well as by the space station's crew before the shuttle docked at the orbiting lab yesterday, revealed seven areas of damage, Cain said.
Of those seven spots, mission managers have already dismissed five of those since they pose no risk, Cain added. Mission managers are very close to clearing a sixth, they said.
But one area about 3.2 inches (8.1 centimeters) long and 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) wide may still pose a potential hazard, and requires further study to be sure.
This NASA image shows the primary damaged tile on the space shuttle Endeavour that engineers are studying to determine whether any additional inspections or repairs are required while the shuttle is docked at the International Space Station during the STS-134 mission.

It's possible NASA will need to have the Endeavour astronauts go forward with an extra heat shield inspection to gather better photos of the area for closer analysis. This activity, called a focused inspection, is relatively rare.
NASA has only had to conduct focused inspections four times since adding them as an optional activity to every shuttle mission following the Columbia shuttle accident.
"The team has not completed our assessments on this site, but the work we've done so far, we believe that we may need to do a focused inspection in order to get some fidelity," Cain said. The existing pictures of that area, they said "are kind of fuzzy."
Most likely, if such an inspection is necessary at all, it will be all that's needed to clear the last spot of any potential risk to the orbiter, Cain said.
"I feel pretty confident that if in fact were not able to clear it by the morning, when we get the focused inspection data that we'll be able to clear this problem and not have to do anything," they said.
If, however, it does turn out that the damaged area make the vehicle unsafe to fly back to Earth, NASA has options to fix it.
"We do have some repair capability," Cain said. "Astronauts would go out with a gun-type applicator and we put some material in the cavity. We also have what's called tile overlay. We have a lot of confidence in both of those repair capabilities if we should need to use them."

Today marks the beginning of the end of Donald Trump's presidency.
It isn't wishful thinking to begin the countdown to Trump's self-destruction on their inauguration day. It's merely a statement of the facts of presidential life: this is no longer a game played out on TV and Twitter.
Crowds gather for US presidential inauguration – in pictures Read more
Everything changes when The Apprentice star takes the oath of office on that stage outside the Capitol. Legally, politically and diplomatically, Trump's world is utterly transformed.
What passed before as media outrage now has a measurable impact on their presidential polls and by extension their presidential power.
What passed before as a sycophantic discussion with their own attorney now opens the door to endless litigation and the clear and present danger of impeachment.
What passed before as a curious cozying up to Vladimir Putin is now transformed into a multi-agency investigation into illegal foreign payments to undermine the election.
We should not confuse populism with popularity. Trump enters the Oval Office as the weakest new commander-in-chief in living memory. Having lost the popular vote by almost 3 million, they have no political mandate to speak of. And their disastrous poll numbers are hard to overstate.
This is the high-water mark of every president's approval ratings – before they do the tough stuff of governing and encounter one of the many fast-moving crises that pass through the West Wing. At the height of their popularity, Donald Trump is polling as badly as George W Bush at the end of their doomed presidency, after the catastrophic collapse of the economy and the bloody disaster of the Iraq war.
A bumper crop of pre-inauguration polls tell the story of how deeply unpopular the 45th president is already. Their personal popularity is as low as 32% compared to 61% favorability for President Obama.
Approval of their transition shows them trailing Obama by an even greater margin: just 40% like the way Trump has performed since November, compared to 84% for Obama's transition eight years ago. Even George W Bush, elected after the extraordinary recount and legal coup in 2000, earned a 61% rating for their transition.
These aren't trivial numbers. They are the white blood cells of the circulatory system that flows through Washington. Good poll numbers can inoculate a president when Congress opposes him. Bad numbers reveal a president vulnerable to outside attacks and embolden their many rivals both inside and outside their own party.
Those numbers are about to get a lot worse. In their first year in office, Obama lost more than 15 points on their job approval. If Trump follows the same track, they will be polling in the mid-20s by this time next year. To put that into context, Richard Nixon's job approval on the day they quit the Oval Office was 24%.
And no Mr President, these aren't rigged polls.
The polls just reflect what people think of you, and they all rate you poorly both on a personal and professional basis. Here's what's rigged: an election you can win after losing the popular vote by more than 2 points, as the polls correctly forecast.
What could drive Trump's poll numbers so low? Unlike Obama, who inherited the worst economy in two generations, the incoming president cannot blame external forces. The greatest threat, both to their presidency and the republic, comes from Trump himself.
Somewhere near the top of the list is potential profiteering from the presidency through their continued ownership of the Trump Organization. It seems Trump will be in breach of the government lease on their new Washington hotel as soon as they are sworn into office today. Their efforts to hold onto the lease – which specifically prohibits government officials from holding it – will reveal their true priorities in office.
According to their personal attorney, Trump has drawn an ethical line by appointing their own ethics officer inside their own company. This is a quaint arrangement favored by foxes guarding henhouses. The ethics of the Trump Organization are irrelevant; the ethics of the presidency, however, are governed by article one of the constitution, which prohibits gifts of any kind from foreign powers.
Even under their own sham scheme, the new president has already breached their so-called ethical standards. “President-elect Trump first ordered that all pending deals be terminated,” Trump's attorney Sheri Dillon told the press last week. “The trust agreement as directed by President Trump imposes severe restrictions on new deals. No new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of President Trump's presidency.”
This will come as news to the good people of Aberdeen who are about to witness the dramatic expansion of the Trump golf course in Scotland. That expansion, confirmed just this week, involves another 18 holes, a new 450-room hotel, a timeshare complex and a private housing estate.
Trump's staff brush aside these niceties by saying the Scottish deal is just a wafer-thin mint of an expansion of an existing deal.
Sadly the constitution doesn't distinguish between new and existing deals when it strictly prohibits the president from drawing any benefits from foreign powers. It just says they are all unconstitutional.
What kind of deals might breach the now famous emoluments clause? As ProPublica has detailed, there's the Indian deal in Mumbai that involves the vice-president of the ruling BJP party, who is also an elected official. There's a deal in Bali, Indonesia, with an Indonesian politician, who has partnered with state-owned companies from China and South Korea. And there's a deal in Manila with a man recently named as an economic envoy to the US by the murderous President Duterte of the Philippines.
You don't have to be a constitutional law professor to appreciate the legal and political jeopardy for Trump. President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath about sex, a supposedly high crime and misdemeanor that is not actually cited by the constitution. Unlike making money from foreign officials, which is.
Finally there's the noose that's tightening around Trump's alleged Russian relationships. You know, the ones the new president said IN ALL CAPS absolutely don't exist and never have, not ever, oh no.
The FBI and five other agencies are now investigating whether Russia covertly transferred cash to pay email hackers in the United States as part of a broader Kremlin plot to influence the presidential campaign in Trump's favor.
We also know that counter-intelligence officials are investigating possible contacts and ties between Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Russian officials.
Almost every scandal gets compared to Watergate, but very few genuinely deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. Of course, Watergate wasn't potentially financed by our mortal enemies in Moscow, even if it did involve undermining a presidential election.
The last covert plot between a president's inner circle and an enemy state was Reagan's illegal gun-running operation to Iran. Perhaps that's what Trump means by stealing Reagan's slogan about making America great again.
Now that he's the 45th President of the United States, the rules of this game have officially changed. Donald Trump cannot trash tweet their way out their problems any more. The constitution does not provide for that particular escape pod from Air Force One.
The TV star is now the desperately flawed lead in a tragicomedy, the author of their own misfortunes. If our bodies are our gardens, this president has unnaturally orange thumbs.
We all have things that drive us mad in horror movies (Oh your brand-new car magically won't start?) but what about someone who writes horror? What type of things do the creators of our favorite movies cringe at seeing on screen?
Simon Barrett definitely knows a thing or two about the horror genre -- they wrote ' You're Next' , and another amazing horror flick, ' V/H/S-2 ' . Simon was kind enough to let us in on five horribly stupid things horror movie characters do and explains why those things are so obnoxious.
Have a 'Vlog'
Maybe you don't remember this term, “vlog.” You're probably regarding your screen right now with a puzzled expression, pondering its vague familiarity. Maybe you have an uncomfortable feeling, like a bad memory you can't fully recollect.
You see, in the early aughts, Hollywood discovered the concept of the internet and with it, the “vlog.” Around this time, the found footage horror subgenre went mainstream, and it became fashionable to have a character in each movie who randomly films everything happening for no good reason. Frequently this character would say things like, “This needs to go up on my YouTube channel!” or “This is the kind of stuff I need if I'm going to make it as a journalist,” thereby promptly the audience to instantly loathe them and wish for their immediate demise, which never happened because they were the character operating the camera.
The “vlogger” character has fallen out of fashion in the past couple of years, but I worry that with new video interface additions to social media, it is going to make big comeback. People in real life who film everything and address an imaginary audience when speaking into their cameras should be avoided at all cost, and why anyone would want to watch a film featuring such a character, unless its plot was a bitter character study of delusional narcissism, eludes me.
Work as a writer
Writers are boring. I can tell you this with authority because I primarily make my living now as a writer. It means that I spend most of my waking hours wearing headphones, glaring at my laptop screen and wondering if there might be some pornography on the internet I haven't seen yet. Writers are dull, introverted, self-obsessed and make a living doing the least visually interesting thing imaginable.
So why are so many characters in horror films writers? Well, probably because horror films are written by writers who've led lives so sheltered that they can't fully fathom another profession. This is known, by the way, as incredibly bad writing. Horror writers often don't recognize how boring they are. So when conceiving a screenplay, they'll say to themselves, ‘I know! I'm awesome, so I'll just make the protagonist like me!' Meanwhile, their neighbors avoid them, their children despise them, and their spouse has been sleeping with their yoga instructor for months.
Whenever I see a horror movie where the protagonist is a writer and clearly a wish fulfillment analog for the loser who wrote the script, I thrash in my seat with shame for my professional peers. That said, my next screenplay is about a financially challenged indie screenwriter who women mysteriously find sexually irresistible, and I think it's pretty emotionally moving stuff.
Spout biographical dialogue
How many horror films have you seen where the characters are introduced en route to a remote location, and during the course of that scene they say something like, “Hey, Tom, when are you ever going to tell Cindy you like her? You guys have been working at the same bookstore together for two years. Also, I'm sick of you guys not trusting me because I tried to kill myself. Anyway, when are we getting to this house I inherited from my estranged father?”
People don't talk like this. In this hypothetical scene, you would never say any of this to Tom, because Tom already knows all of this information. He's either lived it, or it's the reason he's in the car. You'll notice the next time you're driving to the grocery store, you won't say to the person next to you, “Hey, can't wait to get to the grocery store. Planning to buy some groceries there.” You talk about other things, because the manifest never needs to be stated.
In the vast majority of horror films, the first scene a character is in will consist of them saying, “This is who I am, this is what I do, and this is why I am here.” These are all things that people almost never actually say in real life, because they are apparent. Occasionally a character will leave out a bit of information that is pointlessly withheld from the audience so it can be revealed later in a “surprise” revelation. This is the opposite of creating genuine mystery. It's horrid.
Bicker
Horror movies are more suspenseful if the viewer is emotionally engaged on some level with the characters. It's simple: if you identify with the protagonist, and care what happens to them or them on some level, then you're more invested and engaged with the film, and more frightened when the protagonist is in danger.
Most horror screenwriters don't know how to actually write interesting characters, so they approach this problem by giving all of the characters needless dramatic subplots, which causes the opposite of its intended effect while also conveniently allowing for annoying exposition (see #3). Maybe a character cheated on their girlfriend, or is planning to propose to her, or is worried they'll break up when they go off to college. That's fine in a drama or comedy where the film is actually about that, but in a horror movie that's actually about a vengeful ghost or masked killer, no one watching the film has any reason to give a fuck.
In real life, when something scary is happening, people bond together, forget their differences, and unite for the sake of survival. It doesn't matter if you hate someone; when a building is on fire and the two of you need to get out, your personal issues are likely to be off the table.
In horror movies, though, characters almost always have personal strife with each other, and it comes up again, and again, and again, even when they're hiding after being chased through the woods. This may be obvious, but effective drama should be organic to film's main story, and be either part of the primary plot or inform or enhance that plot. If the main plot would be unaffected if the details of a character's background were different, then that information shouldn't be in the film, and any time spent on it just wastes an audience's time and causes them to like the characters less, not more, because it's annoying.

Mind maps are a great tool for creative people, in that they are a very quick, natural way for us to get whatever is in our head out of there and on paper where we can see it. But I've recently learned of a powerful way to increase the value of my mind maps: I use them to address how I feel.
The typical way that we do mind maps is based on topics. One topic relates to other, which relates to another, and so on. (For a good primer on how to do mind maps, check out Buzan's How to Mind Map.)
All this cognitive mapping is fine and good when you're not cognitively clear about the project, but the truth of the matter is that motivation has more to do with emotions than it does with thoughts (and cognitive stuff). Deep down, how you feel about something weighs more heavily than what you think about something.
Where Does This Stuff Come From?
On one particularly melancholy day a few months ago, I made a mind map to address why I was stuck. It had its normal cognitive stuff, and when I was done, I wasn't settled. Just playing around, I added a feelings bubble along each major dimension of my life. The feelings that came up for my business were: afraid, alone, vulnerable, failure, fraud, and ineffective. Instead of trying to make myself feel something different, I just wrote what I was feeling.
Then I was able to ask some questions:
Why was I feeling alone? What could I do about it?
What could I do about it? Why did I feel like a failure? What example was I using to compare my progress to?
What example was I using to compare my progress to? Why did I feel like a fraud? Who was I cheating?
And so on.
Once those feelings were out on the table, I could process them. And after I started answering the questions, I saw that those feelings were just fleeting feelings, and it was okay to have them…but they didn't correspond to the way the world was. Once I accepted the way the world was, I understood that those feelings weren't my own – they where just the trash, noise, and shit sandwiches that pessimistic people are all too eager to share with others.
I returned to the cognitive parts of the mind map and kept going. Unsurprisingly, I ended up with several pages of mind maps, and soon thereafter made the changes I needed to that propelled me on the path I'm on now.
The point here is that why I was stuck had nothing to do with the cognitive things like ideas, thoughts, and relationships – it had everything to do with the way I was feeling. That was they key insight then, and it had dramatic changes to the way I understood productivity. (You'll hear much more about this soon.)
It's Not About Making Yourself Get Unstuck – It's About Letting Yourself Get Unstuck
If you're currently stuck or need a liberating boost, make a mind map and add a bubble for your feelings. If you're good for now, make a note to give it a try. Here a few key points:
Let yourself feel and write whatever it is that you're feeling. You don't have to share it with anyone, and just because you feel it doesn't mean that it matches the way the world is. Don't try to hide or resist what you feel, as it'll only make it worse.
Once you have an honest assessment about your feelings, start asking why you feel that way. Don't judge how you should feel – just ask why you feel that way. Where's it coming from?
After you've done some open question-asking, ask yourself whether that feeling had some validation from the world. If it does, what can you do to change the world? If it doesn't, what can you do to listen to the world?
Change the world if you need to; trust the world if you don't.
I hope this helps you when you need it. I know it helps me.
But balance has a figurative element as well. A truly balanced wine will have tension and energy, as with German rieslings that walk a tightrope between cloying sweetness and mouth-parching acidity, thrilling as they teeter back and forth, or great Champagnes that crackle with a vivacity that demands another sip.
The flavors of a wine must also be in balance, as with the push-pull between bitter and sweet so typical of many Italian reds. This, in particular, was where we found too many of the Bierzo wines in our tasting falling short. We loved the aromatic fruitiness of these wines, but quite a few showed an off-putting bitter quality that was out of proportion to the other elements.
What may have caused such a disjointedness? I can only speculate, but I would guess that either the grapes were not properly ripe at harvest, or the wine was overworked in the cellar, as producers tried to manipulate or eke out of the wine more intensity than it had to offer.
“It really depends on where mencía grows,” Gil said. “It's got to have balance, but it's hard to handle properly, like pinot noir.”
Though we were perhaps more aware of the misses, our tasting had its hits as well, like our No. 1 wine, the 2010 Vico from Raúl Pérez. Mr. Pérez is one of the superstar winemakers in northwestern Spain, and their wines always show great purity and definition. This wine was burlier than their more graceful Ribeira Sacra wines, an excellent example of mencía made in a slightly warmer climate, with fruit flavors buttressed by mineral and oak accents. Yes, it was beautifully balanced, and it will reward a few more years of aging. At $35, this was one of Mr. Pérez's more modestly priced wines. Other cuvées can soar past $90 or $100.
Our No. 2 wine, the 2011 El Pájaro Rojo from Losada, was a juicy, fruity, structured wine with spicy, herbal notes unburdened by flavors of oak, unpretentious and pleasurable. At $16, it was our best value. We also liked a slightly more expensive 2009 Losada, which was earthy, smoky and still a bit tannic. It was our No. 5 bottle.
Two other wines especially worth noting are No. 3, the fresh, peppery, earthy 2009 Casar de Burbia, and No. 4, the bright 2010 Corullón from Desciendientes de J. Palacios, a producer that has been instrumental to the revival of Bierzo in the last 20 years. The Corullón seemed a bit oaky to us, but I think it should integrate better with time.
Researchers from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU, Spain) have been the first to discover the presence of certain aldehydes in food, which are believed to be related to some neurodegenerative diseases and some types of cancer. These toxic compounds can be found in some oils, such as sunflower oil, when heated at a suitable temperature for frying.
"It was known that at frying temperature, oil releases aldehydes that pollute the atmosphere and can be inhaled, so we decided to research into whether these remain in the oil after they are heated, and they do" María Dolores Guillén, a lecturer in the Pharmacy and Food Technology Department at the UPV, said.
The researcher is a co-author of a project that confirms the simultaneous presence of various toxic aldehydes from the 'oxygenated α, β-unsaturated group' such as 4-hydroxy-[E]-2nonenal. Furthermore, two have been traced in foods for the first time (4-oxo-[E]-2-decenal and 4-oxo-[E]-2-undecenal).
Until now these substances had only been seen in bio-medical studies, where their presence in organisms is linked to different types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
The toxic aldehydes are a result of degradation of the fatty acids in oil, and although some are volatile, others remain after frying. That is why than be found in cooked food. As they are very reactive compounds they can react with proteins, hormones and enzymes in the organism and impede its correct functioning.
The research, which is published in the Food Chemistry journal, involved heating three types of oil (olive, sunflower and flaxseeds) in an industrial deep fryer at 190 ºC. This was carried out for 40 hours (8 hours a day) in the first two, and 20 hours for the linseed oil. The latter is not normally used for cooking in the west, but it has been chosen due to its high content in omega 3 groups.
More toxic aldehydes in sunflower oil
After applying gas chromatography/mass spectrometry techniques, the results show that sunflower and linseed oil (especially the first) are the ones that create the most toxic aldehydes in less time. These oils are high in polyunsaturated fats (linoleic and linolenic).
Adversely, olive oil, which has a higher concentration of monounsaturated fats (such as oleic), generate these harmful compounds in a smaller amount and later.
In previous studies, the same researchers found that in oils subjected to frying temperatures, other toxic substances, alkyl benzenes (aromatic hydrocarbons) were found. They concluded that of the oils studied, olive oil is the one that creates the least.
The dose makes the poison
"It is not intended to alarm the population, but this data is what it is, and it should be taken into account" Guillén highlights, who points out the need to continue researching to establish clear limits regarding the risk of these compounds. "On some occasions the dose makes the poison" the researcher reminds us.
Spanish regulations that control the quality of heated fats and oils establish a maximum value of 25% for polar components (degradation products coming from frying). Nonetheless, according to the new study, before some of the oils analysed reach this limit, they already have a "significant concentration" of toxic aldehyde.
The study counts all the aldehydes (not the just harmful ones) that are generated during frying. Furthermore, the authors present a model that allows the prediction of how any hypothetical oil will evolve in the same conditions, if they know its initial fatty acid composition.
A peace consultant narrates how revolutionary efforts improved lives and showcased self-determined development in the remotest mountain communities.
By DEE AYROSO
Bulatlat
MANILA – Even as government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) begin to draft an agreement on social and economic reforms, the latter already prides itself in achieving gains in addressing poverty, as it implements agrarian revolution in guerrilla zones around the country.
In the mountainous Cordillera region, agrarian revolution is not only uplifting indigenous people's lives but also affirms that revolutionary struggle can achieve self-determined development for national minorities at the local level.
In an interview with Bulatlat, Kennedy Bangibang, NDFP peace consultant for Cordillera and national minority affairs and a Taluktok-Kalinga, spoke of how indigenous communities increased their food supply, initiated programs on social services, and even sourced their own sustainable energy – all through revolutionary cooperation under an agrarian revolution program.
As an example, they narrated its implementation in six interior villages in one of the Cordillera provinces.
“These are the seeds of autonomy,” Bangibang said. In the same breath, they said these are being nipped in the bud by continued military attacks, from past administrations up to the present.
A political detainee since 2013, Bangibang was released on bail in August to join the GRP-NDFP peace talks. Beyond the release of political prisoners, the Duterte administration's sincerity in resolving poverty and addressing the roots of armed conflict may just be tested now by how it will treat these revolutionary initiatives.
Reds help identify problems, find solutions
Agrarian revolution, the “main content of the people's democratic revolution,” aims to liberate farmers from various forms of exploitation based on their landlessness or lack of land. It also aims to promote productive cooperation among peasants.
In the Cordillera region, large-scale mining companies have encroached on indigenous ancestral lands, with the promise of jobs and development. After more than a century, the impoverished people want no more of it, as they attest to its destructive plunder of the environment.
Bangibang said in various periods, the NPA in Cordillera helped the indigenous people defend their ancestral lands, and drove away big mining corporations. “The people staged protests, but these were not enough because the military and local government officials were on the side of the companies,” they said. The NPA staged punitive action against destructive corporations.
They may have kept their lands, but indigenous peasants remain plagued with low productivity, low prices of produce, and high cost of farm production, along with high transport costs, especially for remote villages.
Bangibang said the average rice harvest from a payaw (rice terraces) can supply only three up to six months of food for a peasant household. This leaves the family hungry the rest of the year, as they look for other sources of income and food.
Peasants also plant cash crops, such as corn and sweet potato, work as farm laborers and engage in odd jobs for additional income. Still, these are not enough, especially for those who have no land to till.
Government social services for education and health are also lacking. Elementary schools are multigrade, with only one teacher managing two grade levels in a combined class. Some villages have health centers but are rarely visited by a health professional, usually a nurse or midwife.
“The revolutionary movement made a plan on how to address these needs. You cannot implement agrarian revolution if you do not first organize the people and raise their awareness about their own situation,” Bangibang said.
The Cordillera People's Democratic Front (CPDF), along with the New People's Army (NPA), unites indigenous peasants, women and youth into sectoral groups, empowering them to turn the wheels for change in their communities. These groups, along with the community elders and even the few professionals, become part of the political organ of power that exercises government functions and implements agrarian revolution, Bangibang said.
Agrarian revolution increased farm production, food for consumption
The revolutionary forces took off from the indigenous tradition of cooperation, or innabuyog, and formed production teams that worked on a schedule to expand the payaws and repair the irrigation system. The teams also dug up a compost pit to make organic fertilizer to enhance soil fertility.
With the expansion of the rice terraces, the communities increased rice production, with one village producing up to nine months of rice supply.
But there is still not enough food for the whole year, Bangibang said, and so the revolutionary forces campaigned to plant the traditional corn variety to maximize the slopes planted solely to green beans. Farmers plant crops like beans to augment their income but still earn very little because of low prices.
Many doubted the plan at first, also because many do not eat corn as alternative to rice, but rather only for merienda, or snacks, Bangibang said. But when the corn harvest came, people were pleased to have more food to eat. The experience also taught farmers how to manage funds and resources, they said.
The communities nearer to the roads planted other vegetables for extra income, while interior ones produced these for consumption. In both cases, production increased food supply.
Running a mill on sustainable energy
After increasing farm productivity, the revolutionary forces turned to post-harvest development. Cordillerans store unthreshed rice as bundles, or uyyon in their granaries, which they thresh by whipping the stalks on a huge wooden pestle. They then pound the grains with a lusong (mortar) to remove the chaff. This process is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and even more so for corn.
The communities then planned to pool their resources and ask for financial assistance from the local government to purchase a rice and corn mill. But they faced one basic problem: electricity.
The villages are far from the national grid and have no electricity. But the mountains abound with resources for energy, and the revolutionary forces decided to harness micro-hydropower.
With the help of NGOs and civic-organizations, the communities built and installed a micro-hydropower system that can operate the mill, as well as supply households with 12 hours of power up to 27 watts each – just enough for lighting or to charge cellphones. Progressive scientists were tapped to train the locals on managing the micro-hydropower. The revolutionary organ drafted policies to define the project objectives, operation and management.
Bangibang's wife, Recca Noelle Monte, an NPA leader who had a background in industrial engineering, helped in planning the project, and later, its maintenance, such as checking water levels. Monte was one of seven revolutionaries killed in a military operation in Lacub, Abra in 2014.
The rice and corn mill initially charged a milling fee of P5 (US10 cents) per can, or 18 to 20 kilos of milled rice – extremely low compared to the P30 rate in commercial mills. The cooperative later increased the fee to P10 to cover operating expenses and earn a small profit. Villagers used to spend three hours to go to the nearest rice mill in the village center. Now it is only 10 minutes away.
“The cooperative earned funds, and the people had fewer expenses and more time,” Bangibang said.
Some communities were able to put up a rice cooperative, selling rice for consumption at prices lower than commercial outlets. Profit mark is only P1 to P2 per ganta or around four kilos. These benefitted the communities, especially towards the end of the farming cycle when food and cash run out.
“People pay with beans, corn, coffee, sometimes even chicken,” Bangibang said.
Revolutionary cooperatives, literacy and health teams
The revolutionary organ mobilized the villagers to initiate social services, through education and health teams. Initially, NPA members were the ones who taught reading, writing and basic science, but they later trained locals who continued the literacy and numeracy program, for adults, youth and children.
Bangibang said in most cases, women age 30 to 45 compose the education teams, as “they are creative, patient and have a natural affiliation with children.”
Even the health teams are composed mostly of women, who implement the health program: sanitation, nutrition, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of simple diseases, acupuncture and use and production of herbal medicine.
NPA paramedics initially trained health workers on basic treatment up to minor surgery. These skills are combined with traditional healing practices and that of the hilot, the indigenous midwife.
The once empty village health centers were manned by health teams, who work on regular rotation, visiting and treating the sick. They also maintain a “pharmacy” of herbal medicine, with raw materials sourced from the rich forests.
The health teams also monitored children's weight, and implemented a feeding program, which necessitated increased production of vegetables. The team also worked with the production team to decide which crop and how much to plant based on their need for consumption.
Military attack on people's initiatives for self-determined, sustainable development
Bangibang said all these gains became possible because of the people's revolutionary efforts which strengthened tribal unity and consolidation, within the framework of the long and arduous struggle for self-determination and national liberation.
“The problem is, militarization is trying to destroy these gains,” Bangibang said.
The successful villages were targeted by soldiers, who put up military detachments. Leaders were then summoned and threatened to stop their activities. The rice cooperatives were branded as “NPA food suppliers,” and its members were harassed and forced to “clear their names.” They were told to surrender to the military and join the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit (Cafgu).
“Sariling kayod ng mamamayan, naabot nila dahil sa unity, tapos sisirain,” Bangibang lamented.
In both Oplan Bantay Laya and Oplan Bayanihan – the counterinsurgency programs of the Arroyo and Aquino regimes, respectively – indigenous peoples (IP) were targeted as part of the “IP-centric approach.” Bangibang said the military views them as a natural base of strength of revolutionaries, not only because of their mountain homes, but mainly because of their inherent collective spirit.
But even as the revolutionary influence enhanced this unity and even helped remove negative aspects such as tribal wars, the military targeted indigenous people for recruitment as soldiers or paramilitary to sow conflict and break the community, they said.
Armed struggle for right to self-determination
In its draft Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms (Caser), the NDFP proposes to break land monopoly through free distribution of agricultural lands. It also aims to improve the peasants' welfare and productivity through formation of cooperatives and collective farming.
To a certain extent, these are already being implemented by revolutionary forces in various parts of the country, as cited by NDFP consultants during a Sept. 23 press conference. The consultants decried how such communities have come under attack, and people are branded as “rebels” under government counterinsurgency programs.
Many hope that things will change when the Caser is signed and actually implemented under Duterte. As of now, agrarian revolution, base-building, and armed struggle continues.
“The peace talks will not prosper if the armed struggle will not continue. Anhin niyang kausapin ka kung wala kang armas?,” they said.
The ruling class, with its political, economic and military might will not give the power to people without a fight, thus, the need for the people to level the playing field with its own army, and a strong political and economic base, they said. Eventually, the indigenous peoples' struggle for self-determination will triumph when national democracy and liberation dawns.
All of your exes would've been way better off in ancient Greco-Roman times.
Have you ever noticed that Michaelangelo's David is somewhat under-equipped? (Yes, yes you have. Hey, it's OK.) It's not just a coincidence. Large penises were considered ungainly in much of art history, mainly associated with fertility gods, satyrs and grotesque old men. For serious. Circumcision was also considered disgusting, FYI.
This specific image of the perfect man originated in ancient Greece:
*The ideal penis was small, thin and covered with a long, tapered foreskin...The immature male's equipment was especially admired, which may account not only for the small size but the scarcity of body hair in classical art. A passage from Aristophanes sums up the most desirable masculine features: "a gleaming chest, bright skin, broad shoulders, tiny tongue, strong buttocks and a little prick.">
*Excuse me while I blush.
This small-penis worship re-emerged during the Renaissance (thanks to Michaelangelo! What a sweet dude!). In fact, many iconic dongs depicted during this time were tiny enough to be obscured by a fig leaf. Derp. Happy Monday!
Any art history scholars out there feel like giving us some more famous penis trends in art?

Reworking material from their first novel, "Hide and Seek" (1973), and folding this into a prismatic blend of autobiographical details, popular music and 1940s film noir, Dennis Potter delivered a drama now regarded as a 20th-century masterwork. Detective novelist Philip Marlow (Michael Gambon) suffers from the crippling disease of psoriatic arthritis. Confined to a hospital bed, Marlow mentally rewrites their early Chandleresque thriller, "The Singing Detective," with themselves in the title role, drifting into a surreal 1945 fantasy of spies and criminals, along with vivid memories of a childhood in the Forest of Dean. As past events and 1940s songs surface in their subconscious, Marlow's voyage of self-discovery provides a key to conquering their illness, while their noir-styled hallucinations evoke the Philip Marlowe of Chandler's "Murder, My Sweet" (1944), starring Dick Powell, who later became a "singing detective" on radio's "Richard Diamond, Private Detective" (1949), crooning to ...

Ole Miss head coach Hugh Freeze led the Rebels to their first nine-win regular season in 11 years, and they earned themselves a handsome pay raise in doing so.
The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal is reporting, citing sources, that Freeze has agreed to terms with the University of Mississippi on a new contract that will keep them in Oxford and pay them in the ballpark of $4 million annually.
UPDATE: Freeze reaches verbal agreement to sign extension http://t.co/dyvtqNl12o — DJournalnow (@DJournalnow) December 2, 2014
According to the Daily Journal's sources, Freeze is “expected to sign the deal soon.” Those sources said they could also have additional funds exceeding $500,00 with which to pay assistant coaches.
Freeze was in the third year of their previous four-year deal, and they earned $3 million for the 2014 season. It was rumored Freeze was weighing competing offers made by Ole Miss and the University of Florida on Sunday, but UF released a statement Monday morning confirming it had not made Freeze a formal offer.

Statement from UAA (2 of 2): anyone and reports claiming that are false #Gators — GatorZone Football (@GatorZoneFB) December 1, 2014
Ole Miss athletic director Ross Bjork told the media earlier this month that the university could offer up to $4 million per year on a new four-year deal for Freeze, which is the maximum allowed under Mississippi state law. Bjork also noted earlier this season they had begun contract talks with Freeze's agent, Jimmy Sexton, but that those talks were not expected to be completed until after the season.
Bjork expressed confidence at the time that the university would be able to compete financially in order to retain Freeze.
The Rebels head coach has posted a 24-14 record in their first three seasons at Ole Miss, including three bowl appearances, a 2-1 record in the Egg Bowl and three wins against top 10 teams. They also led the Rebels all the way to No. 3 in the nation earlier this season.
Including their one season at Arkansas State, Freeze is 34-16 as an FBS head coach.
INTRODUCTION:
Gastro-oesophageal reflux occurs twice as much during transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations (TLOSRs) in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) compared to healthy volunteers (HVs). Our aim was to assess whether the localisation of the postprandial acid pocket and its interaction with a hiatal hernia (HH) play a role in the occurrence of acidic reflux during TLOSRs.
METHODS:
Ten HVs and 22 patients with GORD (12 with HH<3 cm (s-HH), 10 with HH > or =3 cm (l-HH)) were studied. The squamocolumnar junction and diaphragmatic impression were marked with a radioactively labelled clip. To visualise the acid pocket, (99m)Tc-pertechnetate was injected intravenously and images were acquired up to 2 h postprandial. Concurrently, combined manometry/impedance and four-channel pH-metry were performed, with pH pull-through at multiple time-points.
RESULTS:
The rate of TLOSRs and the per cent associated with reflux was comparable between all groups. However, acidic reflux was significantly increased in patients, especially in patients with l-HH. Acid pocket length was significantly enlarged in patients. Moreover, immediately before a TLOSR, the acid pocket was more frequently located within the hiatus or above the diaphragm in patients with GORD (s-HH, 54%; l-HH, 77%) compared to HVs (22% of TLOSRs). Acidic reflux was significantly increased when the acid pocket was located above the diaphragm in all groups compared to a sub-diaphragmatic localisation.
CONCLUSION:
The position of the acid pocket is largely determined by the presence of a HH. Entrapment of the pocket above the diaphragm, especially in patients with l-HH, is a major risk factor underlying the increased occurrence of acidic reflux during a TLOSR in patients with GORD.
